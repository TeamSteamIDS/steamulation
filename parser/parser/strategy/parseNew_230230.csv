												The short version:Divinity: Original Sin aims to be a modern day Ultima 7 and is reminiscent of many of the older games in the genre, it will make many of you who did like games such as Baldurs Gate II and Planescape Torment very happy indeed, especially if you also like turn based tactical combat. Players will be able to create a team, make choices and see how the consequences of their actions bear out. The long version:This is a game with little to no hand holding and it does not insult your intelligence by making this game accessible to your five year old sister, no this game is a deep tactical turn-based RPG experience.  Not only will you have freedom over your choices in the story (consequences and choices, even disagreements, will affect how things go), but also in how you get there.You will be forced to interact with the world and speak to the people in it to gain information and quests, this is especially true as there are no exclamation marks over their heads telling you that this person is important or that they have information you need. It's also a game that rewards exploration, should you be careless enough you could find yourself completely missing out on certain quests. You can even kill most npc's in the game should you wish to do so (with the exception of a very few plot specific ones), but be careful of what you decide to do, there will be consequences for your actions.There will be puzzles, lots of traps and mysteries to solve and interesting ways to approach many of the quests, you have the freedom to go wherever you want and the areas/monsters -wont- scale to your level, meaning you could die a very horrible death by exploring too far when you are low level. You could also be very skillful with the items/weapons at hand and somehow actually kill that level four troll while you are just a meager level two knight.Being a rogue is especially fun as you can steal nearly everything, including snatching paintings off the walls, pick pocketing their weapons or even keys to their homes for a later ""visit"". Stealth is also very viable when stealing, but be careful, if you are caught people will dislike you and that will affect prices and information you can get, eventually you will be thrown into jail. Once there your partner can either come and bust you out or... well.. i wont spoil the surprise for you, suffice to say that there are more ways than one to get out of jail.Party-based turn-based combat will encourage players to shape and control the game's environments, and to discover and utilize various skill and spell combos that you can choose for your party membersBut the best part is the superb co-op experience, gone are the days when only player 1 gets to decide upon important decisions. You can both talk to any and all npcs and you both take part in dialogues during important events or with certain npcs, and should you two disagree on how to resolve a quest or dialogue you can have your characters argue over it. They will also react to certain things, for example, if you steal something your partner can start up a dialogue with you to either condone your actions or condemn them.As to not spoil anything in the game this example is merely fiction and not present in the game. (Not to my knowledge at least)example: You find a valuable gem on the beach and player 1 wants to sell it while player 2 wants to try and find the owner of it, stating that its immoral to take such a valuable object from someone who obviously dropped it.  Player one then gets a few different dialogue options to try and talk some sense into the other player's character, he can choose between a string of diffrent types of retorts and some might be intimidate, persuade, charm etc. After he has chosen his retort player two can choose a counter argument and will utilize the skill you chose and a game of rock, paper, scissors will commence, you will utilize the skillpoints in that particular skill you choose to gain an advantage over your friend in this game.  Depending on the outcome it will either be in favor of your decision or not, this will also give you points in various personality traits such as romantic or pragmatic depending on what you choose to say and these points will net you bonuses to your personality and other skills. Also it can be quite possible to make the two characters hate/love each other in the end.This went on far longer than i intended so i will end this here by saying that the game is great and hopefully it will stay as amazing as it is now throughout the whole game (currently playing through it). Also, im Swedish so my english and grammar is not perfect, apologies for that.			"

												In a gaming world full of handholding, uninspired battle systems, and just sheer crap, Divinity is a shining diamond in the rough.Graphics - 9/10: Loot-based, dungeon-crawling RPGs are never known for their graphics so I will rate it on a level equivalent to similar games like Torchlight 2 and Diablo 3.  I'm going to put this simply - Divinity is ****ing gorgeous.  The art direction is spot on, the colors are bright and bring the world to life, and the character designs are great too.  You won't feel like you're trudging through the same damn dungeon or cave for the 50th time in a row.  Everywhere feels unique.  You'll traverse vast forests of green, blistering cold mountain tops, firey fields of skeletons and so much more.  It's a well-imagined world that makes the game worth of a 9/10 score in the graphics department.Sound - 8/10:  So don't expect full voice overs or anything like that.  There will be spoken dialogue from time to time- particularly from your main characters, but for the most part NPCs' dialogue is all written (but very well written mind you).  So why am I giving it an 8 for sound?  Because the music is some of the best I've heard in a video game...EVER!Story - 8/10:You're a Source Hunter (yeah I know...just another cliche name for a hero that's received his title and known for aboloshing evil magic and foes from the land).  But don't let that make you overlook what's an otherwise pretty good story as far as loot-based RPGs go.  You start out by coming to town to solve a murder.  I think this mystery-style beginning really helps drive the games gameplay.  Divinity: OS expects you to listen to NPCs, pick up on subtle hints found in text and side character dialogue, and really just discover, discover, discover to unravel the story and new missions.It's worth noting that some may as a result get really frustrated by this lack of handholding; I on the other hand think it's great and really helps add to the game's charm.Gameplay - 11/10:This is where the game shines.  All aspects of this game are fun.  As stated earlier, the clue-finding and unravelling of the story are fun.  You'll be posed with hints, clues, and puzzles which will lead to scratching your head, yet always persistant on unlocking the next series of quests.Beyond this, the interactions amongst your party's characters and NPCs is fun.  Divinity includes a rock-paper-scissors style mini-game to determine the outcome of conversations.  I know it sounds weird, but it's actually really fun.  If an NPC is not particularly interested in giving up information to you, then you can try to beat him at a game of RPS.Where this game truly shines though is in the battle system.  Everything is action point and turn-based driven.  Depending on speed and initiative, an order to character turns will be determined at the beginning of the fight (similar to FFX).  Character's can obviously use special skills and spells to influence their turn postions.  You also have action points for each turn which again is stat-driven based on a characters constitution among other things.  Obviously different skills and spells take different amount of points to cast depending on their power and your overall skill level.So far I'm sure this sounds like a pretty standard turn-based battle system.  BUT WAIT - THERE's MORE.  Truly the best part about Divinity is the unique use of elemental environments.  Characters can cast spells, blow up barrles, and manipulate the environment in all sorts of ways to overcome foes.  Group of enemies standing in a puddle of water?  Shoot an electric bolt to make them all stunned for 3 turns.  No puddle of water?  No problem- cast a rain spell first across the battlefield to create your own puddles then shock it.  Of course that's a simplistic approach that you'll learn how to do in the first 10 minutes of the game.  I won't mention the other awesome environmental elements you can manipulate 'cause I think Divinity is one of those games where part or if its spirit is the unknown.  There's A LOT to learn in this game.  There is, for instance, both crafting and blacksmithing skills in the game, that is so deep and complex, that after 40 hours of playing, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface yet.Overall 10/10:  It's one of the best RPGs I've ever played - hands down.  You're really not doing yourself any favors by passing on this game.  In fact, I'd call you a fool if you did.  This game should be played by every and any person that considers themselves a gamer.

Early Access Review
								I backed this game on Kickstarter and have had lots of fun in the alpha so far. If the bugs that are currently in the game can be worked out before release, then I'd heartily recommend it to anyone who's a fan of RPG's.The game has some interesting ideas, and from what I've seen so far I think the experience can only be enhanced by playing it in the two player cooperative mode that will be available on release.The turn based combat is fun, beyond the generic ""villager"" conversations that crop up everywhere, the dialog is interesting, and little puzzles keep you from facerolling your way through without putting any thought into what you're doing. The game doesn't hold your hand, but if you're into RPG's, your so interested in seeing what the next person is doing, or how to solve the next puzzle that you wouldn't want it to anyway.			"

												Here's how to game basically sums up:ME: ""Hey, you see those skeletons up there?""MY FRIEND: ""Yep. We are level 6 and they are level 8. There's no way we can beat them.""ME: ""Okay here's what we do. I'll drop a barrel of oil here and you send Wolgraff stealthed into the middle of them. Have him place a line of oil barrels weaving through them. Then I'll run in and stun one of them to start the fight. As soon as they see us, I'll shoot an exploding arrow and ignite the chain of oil barrels we placed. When they turn to attack Wolgraff, just send him the teleporter pyramid and he can teleport back to us. Finally, they will all try to run out of the burning fire, and as soon as they step into this little puddle of water in front of us, you electrocute them. Since they will be stunned, we can pick them off slowly with our pathetic weapons. Sound good?""MY FRIEND: ""Uhhhhh. . .""ME: ""Great! Here goes!""10 seconds later: BOOM. ZAPPP. THUD.ME: ""It worked!!!!""We walk away without a scratch			"

												I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.The combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.This game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.If you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.Well done Larian.

Divinity Orginal Sin = Baldurs Gate 3! Seriously, after i started the game and played it for the first hour i had to shut it down and make sure, that i actualy started Divinity: Original Sin[/b] , because it was just THAT good! :DIts basicaly Baldurs Gate 3 and it will also be one of the best coop games ever. You can play the wohle game with drop in/drop out co-op with some friend/random guy. You can have a total of 8 Characters (2 starting chars, 2 henchman and 1 summon each). There are currently 4 companions (full story) and 42 Henchmens (hireable for gold). More will be released for free.On game start you create 2 Chars. You can fully customize em, like gender, class, perks, skills, stat points etc. There are no restrictions and you can actualy make some crazy characters.Fighter with earth magic who uses 2 hand weapons, crossbow and tanking skills? check.Rogue with teleport powers, haste, backstab and charming skills? check.Witch that curses, throws fireballs, heals your party while beeing guarded by a huge lighting elemental? checkRanger with cooking skill, sneaking, able to talk to animals and trading + crafting skills? check The visuals Spell SFX are realy amazing. And bloody hell, this game is challenging! No, there isnt any crap like flys or rats to kill. An undead knight is actualy as strong as your own fighter char. If you make one wrong descision or move, youre dead....thats simply it :D.For example, if you fight an undead army (3 fighters, 1 mage, 2 archer for example) and just one undead fighter gets near your mage, he will kill your mage in 2-3 hits :).i recommend playing the game in co-op with 2 chars that have the lone wolf perk. This way, its basicaly 2 vs the rest of the world, while each player has a realy strong and epic char due to the lone wolf stat bonuses. Lone Wolf makes the character unable to hire an companion but he gets huge bonuses (like 70% more life, more AP) but you can still summon. So in the end you can have the 2 chars + 2 summons if you play with lone wolf perk.Combat in this game is turn based. All actions use action points, the faster (dextery + speed stats) your char is, the more AP you get. There is a huge range of skills + spells and not 2 of em are the same. Each spell is unique and you need to decide round for round what skills youre going to use...there is no ""press X to win"" ;)Also, the soundtrack used in this game is realy epic...its kinda like skyrim one, with drums and chanting womans and stuff. i just think 130 different soundtracks are a bit to much, but hey...more is allways better, right?Now to the bad points:i dont recommend the game at all to casual players. Its like the ultimate anti casual game, because if you just run around, clicking through npc dialoge and run like a chicken into the next fight, you will end up dead, with no way of winning. There is alot of lore around in the game and if you just skip through it all, you will have no clue what the heck is going on around you.All loot is random, which can lead to some crazy playthoughs. Its perfectly possible to have allmost no chance of winning anymore, because you only found crap or you used all items. Even the merchants have random stuff. On the other side, its also the reason why the game has a huge replayability. You never know what you find around the next corner. The game also has a realy complex crafting system, from cooking to crafting new sword, there is something for everyone.Edit: Having now played 60+ hours, this game is my new all time favorite RPG. By reading the forum, i found out that, i have finished around 1/3 of the game. Crazy!  :)Overall, i give Divinity Original Sin a 9 out of 10.If you have any questions just add me in Steam :)			"

												-Lacked the money to buy a minor heal spell for my knight. -Infurated, began to murder every npc in town-Their blood now serves as a healing source for my leeching talent11/10-----Edit (since people actually took the time to read this)I play this game along with my girlfriend in co-op mode. While i wouldn't consider myself new to this type of games, i was soon reminded of how hard RPGs can be.For people that are new to the genre, this game can prove to be quite frightening, especially at the beginning, even in normal difficulty. The lack of direction given, or... the freedom of choice you have... makes the game quite confusing at first, which is why its highly recommended to always read the dialogue carefully. The game even gives you the option to read again the whole conversation through the conversation log tab.Co-op mode adds to the fun of the game. The fact that you can play the entire game along with a friend makes it the more enjoyable to go through. While people can argue that co-op can make any game look better, Divinity: Original Sin, gives a further meaning to play with your friend, having the NPCs actually acknowledging your companion and not just simply having it there for the sake of having someone around. You can get to talk with your allies at any time, getting to know them more. At certain times, depending on your actions, you will even get short interactions with whoever is in your party that can boost certain traits based on the answer given. There is a meaning for your friend to be there, is not like other games where your co-op companion is just another clone of yourself.The gameplay is fun. Turn-base combat system based on AP (Action points) is self explanatory, the more AP's you have, the more actions you can make in your turn. Each character has its own APs that are boosted by their attributes and gear. You are given several classes to pick from though you are not prohibit from learning other classes abiilties. For example, my knight can use water-based skills which are the ones that can grant healing spells along with other water/ice abilities. As for character appearance customization, its not really deep, in fact, i believe it might be one weak point of the game. Overall, the game is incredibly addicting and fun. While the early levels might discourage newcomers, this game sure is one big reminder that classic-style RPGs are not dead and can show up at any time to surprise us and remind just how fun and frustrating they used to be. I was lucky enough to encounter no bugs so far, which is something i am grateful for seeing how i read some bugs around that can make progress quite more painful than what it should.I would hate myself if i had to give a real numeric value to the game, so i will say this: ""If you are curious about the game, buy it, you will simply not regret it""One last thing, save often. F5 will be one of your strongest allies. (Not kidding, really, save often)			"

Early Access Review
								This game is so good I can't even write a joke-y review about it. Even though it is in early release, it is still one of the most fun games I have played this year. It draws heavy inspiration from older games such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape:Torment , and with its beautiful graphics, the isometric gameplay makes myself (as a fan of those games) feel right at home.What makes Original Sin so good, is that it fills a gap that has been missing in the past couple of years. Character driven RPGs that don't hold the players hand through the whole ordeal are far and few between. The isometric view gives combat a strategic feel, and gives life to the world as your character interacts with the environments around it.The combat is challenging, satisfying and very strategic. Using rainspells to create puddles, and then electrifying those puddles to stun opponents is a strategy which the developers try to tout in many of the dev diaries. I went in thinking ""great, thats going to be it, oh well."" But when I pulled off feats such as teleporting a skeleton with a bomb on his back into a crowd of enemies, I felt a magical little feeling in my belly.The story is pretty interesting so far, and follows two Source Hunters as they Hunt Sourcerers (Yeah, okay, its a little dumb). But its good. The game however isn't for everyone. It may not be for those who don't enjoy reading and paying attention during their RPGs, as there is very few instances of voice acting, and even fewer instances of quest markers. Everything is derived from the well-written dialogue between your characters and NPCs, and from exploring your surroundings.The game runs great. Let me stress that. I don't have a gaming computer, I don't even have a gaming laptop. I have a crappy Dell thats a few years old, and doesnt have a dedicated graphics card. And the game runs smooth as butter on Medium/Low.It really is a great game, and I urge anyone who is in the mood for a very fun RPG that doesn't hold your hand to pick up a copy.Oh, and there is co-op multiplayer! I haven't tried that yet, but if I had I'd probably be telling you how sexy it is.			"

								ALPHA REVIEW! Will try to update once release has arrived. Most of the problems have been solved now so it can only be better then this review :PCertainly an unexpected arrival of triple A qualityTopview action-rpg with turnbased combat, the graphics are nicer then most topview games though ofcourse not that near to next-gen quality ;DThe movement is smooth, it reacts nicely to mouseclicks and the pathing seems to work very well mostly (at waypoints it still tends to stand behind the portal instead of in front). The dialogue is nice and allows for alot of changes in the world that actually really affact you (even in this early stage.. ive almost tried murdering everything/everyone once to see what would happen XD)Sometimes there are a bit to much choices (like 10 or more) but thats rare and doesnt bother to much as you dont need to talk to everyone anyway. The combat is nice. Atm some spells might need a better visual effect showing what area it will do damage in and ofcourse alot of the spells and stats are still missing. Nonetheless the combat system works quite well and it feels really good. The turnbased system is one that ive not been used to in a while but its almost like second nature anyway. At higher level mobs and bosses it can get quite tricky and will require tactics. Luckily enviromental stuff works great .. some things arent in yet but making people slide and fall with ice, guiding electric dmg with water, burning oil etc. you spill out of barrel or lighting poisonous gasses is funny as hell.Aside from that.. exploration and gazing. I kept looking around at all the wonderous things at the side of the road and i hated every sign/roadsplit for making me have to choose.. i wanted to see everything XDThe itemsystem is compact and simple (atm sorting inventorydoesnt really work well). This means you have a nice amount of combinations you can do.. you can combine nails with wood or a stick to make a spiked mace, buckets to make bucket helmets etc. etc. I myself havent fully gone into this but accoding to Larian there will be a massive amount of funny combinations.The one thing i really feel lacking atm is character customisation. Which includes customising character at creation, amount of skills available atm and amount of character-relationship stats. However as these are a big part of the game, they will come.The graphics are nice. At first i thought it was slightly bloomy but after a while you realise it just fully fits the game and it just looks great. The performance.. depends. On low-end PCs it runs amazing mostly, at high-end PCs it still runs well, but not as good as expected and people with SLI sometimes have problems with it.Thats about it.Do realise... this is alpha			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is a classic example of how old-school RPG is made anew. It is the product of old-school gameplay coupled with its own niche and original features.Old-School Features (Present in most CRPGS):- Slow-paced tactical turn based combat- Widespread treasures in the form of clickable debris and vessels (barrels and the like) - Multiple non-linear quests completion- Multiple character builds and party compositions- Free roam and exploration- Massive lore and dialogueWhat Makes Divinity:Original Sin fresh:- Use of elements and Terrain where they cooperate and collide as a gameplay mechanic (water channels electricity and such): Imagine Magicka meets tactics- Conflicting opinions of Main Characters determine the outcome of a quest (only applicable if you play co-op).Negative:- Bad interface- Starts strong with many things presented as well as a variety of quests, but severely diminishes against the end, content feels rushed.- Story drags out.- Little or non-existant voice acting for games with pre-made characters (story-wise).- Certain decisions/negotiations with NPC revolves on the result of rock-paper-scissors match with the NPC, this absolutely destroys immersion where whether the decision of walking away unscathed or ended up massacring them rests on luck.Personal ExperienceOverall, I had a blast playing this game with a partner and there are many memorable moments throughout the game. However, I do feel that this game is highly overrated and it is nowhere at the top of my list. It is still a game that I would recommend to RPG fans out there simply because there are not many well-thought out and engaging RPG games that you can play with your friends out there in the market.

												So far this game is turning out very well! It is by the same makers of one of my favorite RPG's of all time, Divine Divinity!Divinity: Original Sin has some great dialogue, tough choices and handles very well, even for an early release. Do yourself a favor and buy into this now if you love roleplaying games! The whole game will be playable in coop with a friend or two, these choices are hard as hell to pick even in solo play but I can imagine in coop these decisions in the game world will be realy ahrd to agree on!Awesome dialogue, good controls, fun gameplay, interesting characters and a gameworld that is fantastic. And that is only the begining! This game is looking to be one of 2014's best rpgs, buy now!If you enjoyed the old ultima rpgs, old Icewind Dale or the old divinity rpgs, this is JUST what you need! As with many of my favorite rpgs this does start a tad slow but things pick up and get better and better as the game goes along. Tons of ways you can go about combat and building you're character, it really is a masterpiece of a game that you can tell Larian put in alot of love into this one.I have now played 185 hours now on the game and I just beat the last boss to beat the game. Overall this is a wonderful rpg and a breath of fresh air. There is a few small issues such as the ui could be a bit better, writing of the story could be improved and I had two small bugs but overall this is a very special rpg. Can't wait to start up a new game with some friends in coop. The combat is perfection, the game has funny humor, jam packed with content and it is fun as hell to play. CRPG's are back people! How great is this?9.5/10			"

												The next Baldur's Gate/Neverwinter Nights/Fallout.  Two-player coop for the main story line, with an editor that supports creation of 4-player coop campaigns (similar to NWN's editor).  Combat is turn based, built from what appears to be Pathfinder's table top combat rules, (attacks of opportunity, etc), but with Fallout's AP (action point) system, very elegantly done.There is also a ""social combat"" system, where you and your friends can ""fight"" over dialogue choices in which a final winner ultimately decides the outcome of the conversation; this is done via rock-paper-scissors.  Character's can gain or lose personality points based on the outcome of these conversations as well, (whether they are altruistic in nature or perhaps more cut throat).  These stat changes also help in other areas later on.Finally, a living, breathing world in which there are often times multiple possible solutions to a problem.  Can't pick a lock?  Bash the door (and possibly damage your weapon in doing so).  Can't bash the door?  SET IT ON FIRE!  Etc.  Want to try to steal something but someone is watching?  Have your friend distract them with conversation!  Is something burning that shouldn't be?  Cast a rain spell or dump water on the fire.  Want to combine abilities for combat?  Have someone cast a poison cloud, and then ignite it with a flame arrow!  The list goes on and on.Crafting is similar to the Android game ""Alchemy"" or Minecraft, in which you start with basic items, combine them, and can ultimately craft higher level items.  This game should be a crafters dream.  The voice additions really bring the world to life, but can be a bit annoying in crowded places, as you hear multiple conversations going on at the same time.  The developers will hopefully tone this down a bit.The world is gorgeous, filled with little details that can be seen by zooming in closely, and your characters perception trait will help you spot items (press and hold alt).  Characters range from dark and evil, to light hearted and humorous (see if you can find the very old talking clam), and is reminiscent of Baldur's Gate.  Also, NO QUEST MARKERS!  The world does not hold your hand in this aspect.  It does give you tools, such as waypoint markers for your map, that help you keep tabs on where certain things are, and it will auto-populate the map with buildings of notable remark, but the rest is up to you.  You will have to enjoy reading. All that said, for old school RPG'ers longing for the days of old, with a new modern technology, wait no more.  Divinity: Original Sin should scratch that itch.  I've spent too much time typing this, game on!			"

								If you enjoy isometric RPGs I highly recommend taking a look at D:OS. The combat is Turn Based instead of Real Time with Pause and they did a good job leveraging some of the added tactical depth such a system allows for. The elemental reactivity in the combat system is a feature I wish more games would utilize. There are tons of skills, items, and multiple solutions for quests. It's very well written and the comedy fits nicely.			"

								Have you ever asked yourself, ""Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?""Guess what? It's your lucky day.			"

												PC GOTY 2014 no doubt!!People who love hardcore RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, or Arcanum will surely fall in love with this game. It's so rare these days to find this kind of games when most RPGs are action oriented.PROS:+ Beautiful world, beautiful graphics+ Environmental effects!!! For example: You can wet the grounds and cast air spells to electrify all enemies who stand above it or cast oil spell and burn the grounds.+ So many possibilities when creating a character. A two handed warrior/sorcerer hybrid? Sure. A mage who good at sneaking and backstabbing? Sure.+ It's quite hard and challenging without making you frustrated. Make sure you create a balanced team without overlapping abilities and skills between your characters. For example: Only take bartering or charisma skill in one of your character, not more.+ A long RPG. It could litterally takes 50 hours or so to finish the game.CONS- Rock Paper Scissors. Too bad in many occassions, you have to play this mini game to win an argument. Daft.- Annoying NPC especially in villages. They keep talking, shouting and mumbling the same dialogues over and over.In short, get this game! You won't regret it			"

The Golden Age of the RPGThere are so many outstanding titles out there at the moment, Wasteland 2 and Shadowrun: Dragonfall DC are out, there are new Witcher and Dragon Age titles on the horizon. It's a good time to be an RPG fan, but where does Divinity Original Sin fit into this hall of RPG fame? Let's fire it up, build a character or two and find out! A game with a lot of character For a crunchy RPG the character creation doesn't feel as daunting as you might expect. It's certainly not as initially intimidating as the also excellent Wasteland 2's character creation screen, that's not to say that character creation here is shallow, far from it. You'll get to create two characters from the start (unless you pick the ""lone wolf trait"" which will give you some extra perks at the expense of your customised travelling companion.) Experienced RPG'ers should be right at home here, pick a character class as your starting point, Knight, Wizard, Ranger etc, then tweak your attributes, skills and spells until you've got your perfect novice source hunter, ready to go out into the world and hunt some serious source! Serious SauceA great power called the source exists in the world of Rivellon, a power once wielded for good but no longer. The Wheel of Time turned and a great darkness invaded the land leaving the source forever tainted, its users driven to madness and destruction. Now only a brave few stand between Rivellon and this dark power which threatens to destroy it. That's where you come in. Murder She Wrote In Divinity original sin you take on the mantle of a novice source hunter (well two novice source hunters, but who's counting).You've been tasked with investigating the murder of a councillor in the town of Cyseal, It's suspected the source was involved and now, like a sword and magic wielding Jessica Fletcher, It's time to figure out ""who dunnit"" There's your trouble! As the game opens, you'll find yourself being unceremoniously dropped off on the sunny shores of Cyseal. It seems a murder isn't the only problem the town is facing. The undead are at the walls and the Orcs are attacking from the coast. Cyseal is a town with more troubles than you could shake a level 10 elemental staff at. You Go First!The game doesn't pull any punches, even before you make it into the town of Cyseal proper, you'll have your first tactical encounter which introduces you to the turn based combat mechanics. Action points are the order of the day here, each character in your group (up to a maximum of four at any one time) will have a specific number of action points dependent on their stats and equipment. You'll spend these points moving, hacking, slashing and casting your way through these turn based encounters.Combat in D:OS is a meaty and very satisfying experience, but it's not just about sorcery and swordplay, your surroundings can play a huge part in these battles too. An Inconvenient TruthEnvironmental destruction is par for the course here, and at first, you will probably do as much damage to your own group as you do to the enemy via environmental effects, that is, until you've figured a few things out. Is the floor covered in oil? then you might want to be careful of stray sparks, a misguided fireball could send the whole lot up in flames, if you happen to be standing in the oil yourself, don't expect the environment to be forgiving, you'll burn along with all the rest. The game can be punishing at times but you'll learn to use the environment to your advantage as you progress and after a short tutorial battle and dungeon crawl, you'll progress into the town of Cyseal.It's here that the hunt begins. The Great HuntWhen you make it into the town, you'll be greeted by a wealth of varied and interesting NPC's. A whistle stop tour of the dock front will start to open up various side quests quicker than you can say ""That ships on fire!"" and ""Do I look like a recruitment agency?"" Don't worry, the in game journal does an excellent job of keeping the ever-growing quest details in order, a feature which I've found invaluable as a memory aid following those frequent occasions where the real world dares to interfere with my  investigations. Eye of the Beholder The graphics do a fine job of enhancing the atmosphere of the game, from dark oppressive dungeons and gloomy rain soaked woodland to bright sunny beaches and the vibrant town of Cyseal itself, everything on screen adds something to the isometric glory. Ear of the... Earholder Whilst some NPC's are voiced, most are not. However, there are enough lines of dialogue scattered around to give the game flavour, most of which are so full of character and voiced with such vigour you can't help but smile. Lines like ""I wouldn't let an orc within 500 yards of my loving nature"" and ""No one has as many friends as the man with many cheeses!"" are great examples of the wonderfully written and often funny dialogue that awaits you here. Schizophrenic EncouragementThe writing is sharp and witty and the interaction between your characters can be hilarious, you can even get into arguments with yourself! A good example of this happened to me early on in my play through when I wanted to dig up a body to follow a lead in my investigation. I was just about to start wielding my trusty shovel when my comrade in arms objected. In situations like this, you can find yourself choosing the dialogue options for both sides of the argument. I couldn't help but get on my high horse about the sanctity of the grave and disturbing the dead with my second character, whilst my first glared on, shovel in hand quipping about short sighted sensitivity derailing the investigation. If arguments like this reach an impasse then your comrades will resort to a quick game of rock, paper scissors to resolve the conflict. This is amazing fun and can lead to alternate paths you might not have considered previously as part of your investigation. The road is longDivinity is long game. If you're the obsessive type and feel the need to complete every side quest on offer then you can expect to spend nigh on 100 hours in Rivellon, so you'll definitely get your monies worth with regards to content...................

												Divinity: Original Sin hails from the golden days of classic-RPG gaming.  It takes portions of what were great about past CRPGs like the Baldur's Gate series, Fallout, Icewind Dale, and the like, and stirs it into one big pot and offers you Divinity: Original Sin.  While the Divinity series is not new to some of us, if you can recall their other RPGs like Divine Divinity, Larian Studios pays great attention to detail and it shows.  Almost everything you do in D:OS has a consequence.  All the careful planning by Larian went into every little detail in Divinity's world.  Original Sin is text-heavy, so do not dive in expecting complete voiceover work for every main character and NPCs.  There are the occasional voiceover work, but they are few compared to the text dialogue.  This does not spoil the great writing though, but it gives it a very ""right at home"" feeling for those that enjoy classic RPGs.  The dialogue is wonderful, well-written, and full of humor.  Even dark humor which is not easy to pull off.Divinity: Original Sin is a challenging game, but it is fair.  Right from the start, it does not hold your hand, but it begs you to search every corner of its vast world.  Every battle, not just boss fights, requires careful planning, strategy, and good tactics.  Your party could be wiped by a small group of common mobs.  But do not be discouraged.  Original Sin is not unfair and cheap against the player.  It simply means, you cannot just lay back and push a few buttons to win a fight so easily.  Allow me to give you one example where I was fighting this one boss, and I was down to my last party member with low health and the boss was also at low health (one hit away from death), and I managed to get off one last shot with my bow, killing it.  At the same time, there was joy, and relief.  You should also know that you can sometimes take on enemies that are 2-3 levels higher than your characters, but it requires great strategy.One of the gameplay mechanics that really stood out for me was the ability to create different effects by applying magic and ability effects to your surroundings. For instance, if an enemy is standing in a puddle of water, you can target the water with an electric-type spell and stun your enemy for a number of turns.  Strategically speaking, you can also place oil barrels in position before battle in your enemy's path and strike it with a fireball spell, or an explosive arrow.  This gameplay mechanic fosters dynamic gameplay on the battlefield, and it rewards players that plan out their strategy.The presentation in Divinity: Original Sin has been well executed.  The menus are easy to navigate, without all the clutter and needless micro-management.  The user interface is slick, clean, and simple yet complex in good ways.  I did not notice input lag.  The controls felt very intuitive for the most part, but not without a small learning curve.  Those that have played CRPGs before will feel right at home.  Those that have not played CRPGs before will get used to the controls within an hour or less.  The controls are very responsive, smooth, and it does not have input lag.  Mouse and keyboard work great.  I have not tried it with a controller.  Moving your party members in the levels feel responsive and fluid.  While Divinity: Original Sin does many things right, the ending was very anti-climatic.  Without spoiling it for you, I will just say this:  Try not to think of the end and enjoy the journey.  D:OS is all about the journey, the gameplay, and the rich detail.Divinity: Original Sin was one of those games that took me by surprise.  It was a refreshing new release in 2014 that blew me away by its shear depth and classic feel.  In a sea of videogames that tend to hold your hand, Original Sin was the complete opposite of that.  It required motivation in thinking; planning out your strategy and tactics to win battles.  The reward was satisfaction from battles where you did not always know going in if you will win.  The tide turns, and you do not know if you will be the victor.  It allows for dynamic gameplay, unlike static gameplay that just lets you hit the ""win button.""  Larian Studios designed a game that respects the player, with a high risk, reward system that works.  - Runner-up for GOTY 2014- Tons of Charm- Humoristic - includes dark humor, as well as light and funny humor- Classic-RPG done right in modern times- Most-improved developer of 2014- Continued Customer Support - Highly responsive to customer's needs with technical issues and difficulties- Developer/Community Manager responds to posters- Amazing graphics and a beautiful game engine- Optimization is well done - D:OS runs smooth at 80fps+ on maxed settings at 1080p (as of this review, GTX 670, i5-2500k CPU)- Several display and graphics options - There is a NO-DRM version from other suppliers like GOG if you choose not to buy it from Steam.  More options is good.You really owe it to yourself to play this RPG.Rating:  9.5 out of 10			"

												Divinity: Origin Sin is a top-down, turned-based Role-Playing-Game that does without the hand-holding, 'let me guide you through my story and you'll learn to love it' experience. There's a huge emphasis on freedom; genuine freedom, not the kind that lets you do what you want for five minutes before prompting you there's a quest you should be doing. In short, Divinity: Origin Sin raises it's middle finger to the concept of guidance and allows the player to decide what to do and when to do it. Graphics:In every aspect, this game is beautiful, and arguablly one of the best looking games, not just within it's genre, but within in all games, ever. From the huge towns filled with NPC's to the lonely mountain passes, the game world feels alive and genuine; never do you feel like you're following a path, you feel as you should, as if you're exploring this huge, open world with a story behind it, and everyone within. It's difficult to describe the graphics in this game purely because they're done so well. There is particle effects, high-quality textures, gorgeous lighting and a strong sense of atmosphere everywhere you go. You might be exploring an old celler, in which case it's misty and gloomy, whilst in town centres the sun is pumping pure beauty upon the entire world. The game is simply gorgeous and without doubt, the best looking game within it's genre, by a large margin. Audio:From the subtle creeks of floor-boards to the raging torrents that is the mountain pass winds, Divnity: Origin Sin delivers a flawless experience in auditory experience. The best possible way to explain the quality of audio in this game would be to ask you to think of a game, any game at all that you think has the best audio. You might say Amnesia because it's subtle but terrorfying or perhaps you might say Child of Light for it's amazing soundtracks, and both would be correct, and I'm sure other examples you might have suggested would be too, but most games have one particular aspect within it's audio that's memorable or excels in some aspect. This isn't true for Divinity: Origin Sin. This game excels in every aspect, from voice acting to the empowering shimmers and charges that spark when casting a spell. It's simply perfect - And that's not a comment I would make lightly. Gameplay:Divinity: Origin Sin is a turn-based game, but only within combat. Outside of combat you're free to explore and roam the world in any way you please. You might find yourself engaging enemies that are a few levels higher than you; you might help an old man steal some fish, then report him to the guards and watch him be dragged away to prison or perhaps you simply want to go around the entire world slaying every single living thing that stands in your way. Freedom is what makes Divinity: Origin Sin so immersive and enjoyable, you're never tied down or told what to do, or when. This game is hardcore, but not in regards to it's difficulty, more in terms of how it presents itself. There are no exclimation marks above NPC's heads to signify importance. There is no charts or tables to show you crafting receipes. There is a lot missing, but it's a very positive aspect of the game that makes it so much more enjoyable and immersive than other Role-Playing-Games. To find out how to craft a weapon, a potion or how to cook a pie, you must find a book, or a note and read it. You won't unlock the receipe, everything is available to craft as long as you know how to do it. Once you find the receipe, you simply need to refer back to it when creating the item. When deciding to complete quests, to find out where to go or what to do, you must talk to NPC's and listen. The information given to you is only useful if you read what was said. There will be no waypoint given or a 'Hey, good job finding that clue, i'll remove all challenge from this game and simply tell you what to do now'. It's challenging, but rewarding. The combat is much alike what you would expect. Every character involved within the combat scenario will take turns, have a set amount of action points and, if they choose, can reserve points for future turns. The system is very fluid and intuative. What makes the combat, and gameplay so enjoyable however, is the emphasis on environmental interaction. See a group of enemies standing in water? Why not zap them with lightning and fry them? -No? How about we freeze the water and stick them in their place. Perhaps you want to spill some oil and ignite it, or perhaps use a teleport spell to throw an enemy off a cliff. If you can think of it, you can probably do it. Narrative and Lore:Now I'll admit, I'm not the kind of person who is likely to sit down and read every piece of lore or material in a game, especially not role-playing-games. I generally don't have the patience nor' interest, so perhaps this next statement will give some meaning to the quality of the writing in this game. I've played for about 15 hours, at the time of writing this review, and have read every single piece of material I've found, and generally find it annoying when I then switch to co-op, and have my partner skip through it all. The writing in this game is really well written, and because of the nature of the game, enaging and meaningful. I know if I don't read it, I won't know what to do. It's almost like a very intelligent scheme plotted by the developers to discourage skipping through material, and I like that.Co-op:The game allows for four characters to be played at any given time, in co-op, you can play alongside another player and control up to two each. There is no limations in co-op, everything you can do it single player, you can do it co-op, but arguablly, it's more enjoyable when played with a friend due to a feature that allows you to argue amongst your characters about what choices to make it quests. Perhaps I want to slay the target, whilst you want to help them. Lets discuss it with in-game dialouge, then argue and see who wins. It's genuinally enjoyable and adds a new layer to the immersion of the games experience.There is also a mod, for those interested, that allows the game to be played four-player co-op, so if that's of interest, good news for you! Mods and Editors:That game supports workshop, mods and even comes with the developer tools to create your own custom campaigns. I've toyed around with this a little, and not being a guru of game development software, I can say it's actually pretty easy to use. There is some script-writing to do when creating dialouges, cutscenes or combat sequences, but there are plenty of easy-to-understand tutorials that can be found within the discussion pages of the Steam community hub as well as on media sites such as YouTube to help guide beginners in creating their own mods. Whilst I'm unlikely to spend much time using these features myself, it's a great addition to have and ultimately means there's a huge pool of endless content to play with once you've completed the main game. That's never a bad thing.Overall:Divinity: Origin Sin is a beautifully crafted RPG that was obviously created by developers who genuinally cared about their product. Every aspect of the game feels polished once, and once again. The game runs perfectly at maximum settings on my GTX 760 and AMD FX-8350 at more than 120FPS solid, without hiccups. The gameplay is hugely enjoyable, the lore is engaging and the hardcore approach to giving the player complete freedom makes this one of the best turn-based role-playing-games, ever. No game is without it's flaws ~ I just can't single out anything I dislike, honestly it's near perfect.It's a masterpiece, a genuine must buy for any RPG fan. ~One of the most enjoyable and engaging experiences to be found within gaming.[/b] "

												Fantastic RPG game. One of the best in years. PROS-No fetch quests-No grinding-Great leveling system that rewards you for exploration, fighting, and arguing with npcs-Enormous amounts of skills and freedom to build you're own party (up to 4 people) any way you want-Fun story with lots of depth.-Perfect soundtrack to catch the feel of the fantasy world-Amazing turn based combat with a lot of emphasis on the surrounding environment. Gameplay is superb-One of the best AI in a long time. They can do to you anything you can do to them in combat. Very unpredictable-Fun and smart sandbox elements that can only be rivaled by Bethesda games.-Challenging puzzles that will take you back in time when those old Resident Evil games picked your brain-Co-opCONS......No cons. Game is a masterpiece. People nitpick small things like inventory being cumbersome or lack of hand holding. But none of those things are big enough to be worthy of a con. This game is too good. 5-10 years from now it will be even better because people will realize how much better it is than most other game released in todays industry. Its one of those things thats gotta slowly sink in. The first couple hours of the game can be very overwhelming. But once you get past that inital learning curve you will be sucked into an amazing fantasy world. One of the most addicting games I have ever played.10 out of 10. Would fall for trap again.

												This game is wonderful. In a year otherwise flooded with terrible games and inexcusable moneygrabbing plain awfulness, Divinity: Original Sin stands out. The developers loved it and listened to the community and it shows - A passion for RPGs and a love for the setting is poured into this game. More specifically, this game has the best combat seen in an RPG ever. Ever. Character development is interesting and every combat is tactical enough that it always feels like it matters how you play. Did you die in a combat and have to reload? Try a different tactic, some different spells and different movements and even the thoughest enemy can be beaten. To clarify, what makes it so beautiful and awesome to play is that it manages to be tough and challenging without being unfairly punishing.That said, the story is so-so - A half-bad fantasy novel with a run-of-the-mill story. It's not terrible or anything, but you will soon forget what you were doing in favor of just finding another exciting battle to put your sword in.9/10.			"

												It's been a while since I've fallen in love with a game as hard as I have with Divinity: Original Sin. It is a game with many glaring flaws, and those flaws are part of the reason I've come to love it. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but those who can stomach its initial few sluggish hours will find a meaty turn-based RPG that pays thorough respect to its CRPG predecessors like Baldur's Gate.Those familiar with pen & paper RPGs, as well as roguelike elements, will feel right at home here. Combat is tough and involved. The game uses mechanics familiar to paper players while being relatively accessible to modern gamers (none of that THAC0 nonsense!). Larian has developed a smart, stern RPG that offers its charm in its unforgivingly old-school game design with absolutely zero handholding. Very few map markers. No quest arrows. Why am I surrounded by level 15 invincible enemies at level 10?!If you like Dungeons & Dragons or TBRPGs in similar veins like Shadowrun Returns, you owe it to yourself to play Divinity: Original Sin. Best enjoyed with a friend who will antagonize you.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is far better than anyone could have reasonably expected. While its excellent world interactivity and in-depth crafting system were things which were talked about and demonstrated before the release, and the typical Larian humour in quests and writing could be expected, its sheer level of quality in other regards is simply off the scale.The battle system may be the best in any computer role playing game ever created. The combination of a full set of modern features, including attacks of opportunity, with an initiative / action point system, free movement and a highly polished user interface is a joy to play and strategize with.However, what truly sets the game apart is the versatility in terms of player agency which it offers. Ideas which you might never even consider in other games, or which might not even be possible to attempt, are not only possible to execute but actually work. This level of interactivity, combined with the very well developed system of elemental area effects and their interaction, allows for an almost infinite number of possibilities for solving situations, both in battles and during exploration.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes using their head while playing.

												Rating - 76/100Recommendation - Grab it, but wait for free enhanced edition upgrade (Edit: I've been told the upgrade is no longer free, so get the Enhanced Edition instead!!!!)Classic PC RPGs have absorbed hundreds (even thousands) of hours of my life since I was a teenager, but after all these years, I can't say for certain that I love them. There are aspects about them that I absolutely adore, and there are aspects of them that make me grind my teeth.Take Baldur's Gate, for example. It's classic. Iconic, even. For good reason, too. It's solidly-built, has a beautifully-designed world, interesting characters, a great story, and a fantastic open-world feel. It also has brutally-difficult try-try-again fights, a moderate lack of direction, and quite a few bugs/glitches. The first time I played BG, I had a game-breaking bug 30 hours in, and was dead in the water.Divinity: Original Sin is certainly similar in that some-good-some-bad regard. During my playthrough, I found a lot to love, and a lot to hate. The story is well-crafted and interesting (although it does ramble), the characters each have their own motivations/backstories (and quests), it's open-world enough for you to miss important things if you aren't paying attention, the graphics are pretty good, and it's a meaty enough adventure to please anyone flying high off a recent dose of Baldur's Gate 2.Now, before I list the cons I found, I have to re-state that I did enjoy the game. I definitely recommend it overall (especially since the enhanced ""remastered"" version is coming out for free soon), but there are bound to be people out there just as nitpicky as me, so I have to list what bugged me.First of all, the difficulty in the first half of the game is RIDICULOUS. You will always be in an area, able to explore at your heart's content, surrounded on all sides but one by enemies that will curb-stomp you into oblivion. As a result, this ""open-world"" game is ostensibly linear, given there's only one area you can go to unless you want your face and limbs rearranged, redesigned, or removed. Then, once you hit somewhere just after the mid-point, battle difficulty falls off a cliff, and you'll be skating through gigantic brawls with ease. I can't really count that as a con, though, since it was a welcome relief for my poor molars.Following right along with the difficulty, the balance in the game is really bad. For the first 50 hours, I built my main character as a ranger. She had high dexterity and speed, a fantastic legendary bow, and a full complement of gear boosting her bow skills. Battles were difficult, but doable. Then, 51 hours in, I found a unique dagger with high damage. I equipped it just to see what a dagger was like (changing literally nothing else I had equipped, even MY SKILLS), and became untouchable. Having spent 2/3 of the game outfitting myself as a ranger, and barely having any dagger skills at all didn't matter. One tiny equipment change, and I was zipping around the arena like a meth-head on fast forward, poking fatal holes in enemies left and right. I wasn't sneaking or backstabbing, just walking right up to mages and barbarians alike, and handily beating them toe-to-toe.Granted, in RPGs, certain builds will always be more viable against certain enemies, but there were no scenarios that proved difficult for my little stabbing princess. It was funny and all, but when there is that big of a difference between build strengths, there is a problem. To be fair, there were a few pretty solid mages behind me providing support, but that half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥little dagger build was making even Madora (who is a BEAST of a warrior) look silly. I kid you not when I say I alone went head-to-head with the final boss while the rest of the team was cleaning up the trash he repeatedly spawned. It was so overpowered, it reminded me of the old JRPGs of my youth, when I would give all the best gear/upgrades to the main character, and trickle the hand-me-downs to the rest of the team (and it would be perfectly viable).I wasn't trickling anything down to the rest of the team here, though, since each character had an almost completely unique set of equipment requirements. I had a ranger, a warrior, a spell-mage, and a wizard, all of which were focusing on different stats.Before I switch down to talk about the smaller niggles and quirks, I have to talk about the combat system, the glitchy, buggy, nothing-short-of-poorly-designed combat system. The main problem I had with it is that enemies dance around a bit while they're idle, and there's no way to pause while giving orders, so targeting is a big fat ol' pain. Essentially, when you click on an enemy to attack, there's a chance the enemy's idle animation just leaned back and roared, making the game think you want to move to the spot of ground right where their head used to be. Even taking off my shoes won't help me count the number of times my character wasted an entire turn running across the arena to stand next to the enemy I just told her to shoot. Plus, there is no way to pause or cancel orders, so bye-bye turn, and good luck standing right next to that massive flaming demon, ranger. Literally the entire game, I was on edge about pixel-perfect mouse positioning and idle animations when I attacked.Plus, getting the mouse cursor to recognize enemies is not the easiest thing to begin with. If a small enemy is standing behind a larger one (according to the camera), they can literally be impossible to target, even if the character you're controlling could reach out and slap them. I was BEGGING for free camera rotation (it only swivels maybe 30° currently) and a dedicated pause button.My final issue (and the big one) about the combat system is that it straight-up lies. For example, Madora will be standing right next to an enemy, and to attack him, she requires 4 AP (action points). In reality, though, once you click to attack, Madora BACKS UP, giving the enemy an attack of opportunity (despite never leaving melee range), and costing an extra movement AP. Your turn plan is now screwed up, and you're injured. Sometimes those little details are signalled to you beforehand (it shows movement and attacks of opportunity), but sometimes they are not. Plus, it's not unheard of for skills that cost 6 AP, for example, to show you on the hot bar that they're only really going to cost 4 AP (they really do cost 6), so pay attention. Let's also not forget that the game often incorrectly calculates how many AP you will need to use. I noticed this a lot towards the end of the game. My dagger girl's attack cost 2 AP, but sometimes when I'd be standing right next to an enemy, it would say 3 AP required. When I attack, only 2 AP are used (as should be the case), but then it again says my next attack will cost 3 AP while it really costs 2. Repeat until you only have 2 AP, when the game will hold up its hands and stop you. Nevermind that you should only be using 2 AP and ARE using only 2 AP each time you've stood in that exact spot and attacked that exact enemy that exact turn, if the game thinks you need 3, you're done.There are a bunch more problems with the combat system, but to sum up, it can't be trusted, and it is the undeniable weak point in the entire game. I would have very few complaints if they fixed it.Other than those issues, the game is pretty great. It has 70+ hours of content, enough exploration/quests to keep you busy the whole time, full campaign co-op, multiple companions you can bring (Madora and Jafar were my 2), a whole slew of attributes/skills/perks to build your unique character with, and just about anything else you would expect from an isometric RPG. It's a fantastic example of how isometric cRPGs can be brought forward into the future.			"

												Complexity. It’s an old RPG trait largely forgotten by a lot of gamers and ignored by most developers. If you like your RPG’s action-oriented and filled with commodities such as quest markers, move right along. Divinity: Original Sin from Belgian developer Larian assumes you’re prepared to actually figure out quite a bit all on your own. It provides a large game world and simply lets you wander around in it. Areas aren’t closed off, all quests can be finished in at least two different ways and you won’t be punished for playing your own way. It brings about the kind of design philosophy that really should exist in every RPG, regardless of its style, combat system or any other differentiating feature.The story follows two main protagonists who start out as Source Hunters trying to figure out a local murder mystery. Naturally, soon they find themselves involved in something much bigger including an orc invasion, undead uprising, mad kings in a frozen land inhabited by elementals and they’ll even visit other dimensions and take to the heavens. Unfortunately, this is the weakest part of the game as the writing isn’t particularly compelling and the characterization is awfully shallow, especially regarding the playable characters. Speaking of which, apart from the two main characters, you’ll be able to recruit more people along the way. However, you’ll only be able to keep up to four in your party. Any others will await for your call in a place called the Hall of Heroes if you get the urge to switch them up a bit.The only real reason to switch characters is to try out different classes and tactics. The character upgrade system is extremely deep and customizable, each class is extremely different with a load of unique traits, abilities and spells. And it’s extremely flexible as well. Just because you committed to a certain class at the beginning doesn’t mean you’re stuck with it if you change your mind. On the contrary, you can mix things up and create something like a rogue specialized in fire spells. You can customize all characters further with weapons and equipment you find along the way. And there’s a ton of loot in this game. Upgrading and customizing your character as well as constantly finding new loot is a huge source of addiction and probably the biggest motivation to continue playing.Original Sin has a turn-based combat system which is awesome because it’s not an under-the-hood system with pause, but with actual turns akin to a regular turn-based strategy game. Apart from being able to witness the myriad of different combat styles, the combat shines thanks to its fantastic convergence of elemental powers. For example, summoning rain will create puddles on the ground and will make your enemies wet. Throwing a lightning bolt onto one enemy will fry him, but will also zap anyone standing in a puddle nearby. Then you can throw a fireball which will dry out the puddles and create mist that will cause enemies to have limited sight. Frozen surfaces will make characters slip and fall, spilled poison can be ignited for additional damage, the possibilities are nearly endless. Naturally, considering that everything you cast on the battlefield will affect your party as well, you have to be careful what you’re doing at all times. It’s just a superb system that never gets old.Divinity: Original Sin is a fantastic looking game, however the art style isn’t particularly distinctive and falls under usual fantasy tropes a bit too often. The same can be said about the soundtrack, it’s definitely pleasing and appropriate, but just doesn’t really stand out in any way. My biggest complaint about the game is that it can be incredibly obtuse at times, particularly regarding the puzzle design. You will actually get hints from books and other sources, but I honestly don’t know what frame of mind you have to be in to figure some of this stuff out. This can get especially frustrating due to how big the world is and considering that a lot of quests span across multiple huge areas.Divinity: Original Sin is one of the big Kickstarter success stories – a rewarding, addictive and unapologetic hardcore RPG brimming with complexity, gameplay depth and content breadth. If only it had a more motivating story, more interesting characters and a more unique game world, it would have been a masterpiece. Still, a few design quibbles aside, this is a great game that will delight anyone looking for a true RPG that brings back cherished genre values and wraps them up in a modern package.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

Early Access Review
								I'll save myself the time and list the major bullet points that make the game based on the Early Access version imo worthwile for purchasing:- modern take on the classical computer RPGs of the 1990s- single player and/or cooperative experience for 2 person of the whole game and the funny part is that even when you play with a friend you dont have to stay together- tactical combat system with action points in a turn-based system which allows for strategic and tactical play- party based game: 2 costumizable characters at game start which can be helped by hireable NPCs and henchmen during the game - 11 starting classes give plenty of options that can be tweaked further to your own liking- classless system to develop your characters the way you want- systemic & interactive gameplay: combine magical spells and manipulate elements like fire, water ice to your own advantage, teleport items around, or become a famous box stacker- deep crafting system: from a pumpkin helmet to simple bread there are lots of possibilites- choices and consequences: disagree with your companions in dialogue and solve quests in a multitude of ways which technically allows you to kill anyone you want- talking to animals with the right skills opens new possibilites and adds a lot of flavour- enjoyable writing (english version cant comment on translations) with a nice humorous undertone- vast gameworld: the full game will feature 4 mas the size of early access gameworld plus multiple smaller maps and dungeons - game will feature a mighty editor and steam workshop integration for fanmade campaigns and stories- nice devs who listened to lots of feedback and implemented it. That is how Early Access should work and they deserve every $- and yes the graphics look gorgeous and beautiful and the game isn't even that hardware intensive Note: Release is on 30th June savegames wont be compatible till then ;)			"

												I've got so many pros to say about this game, that I have to make a tl;dr for the tl;dr!!! If you ever were a fan of Baldur's Gate Series, Icewind Dale, or other rpgs like them, this is a MUST-PLAY (only this one is a turn-based and not a real-time pause)!I also recommend it for PnP (pen 'n' paper) players (as I am one). The thing I love about games with this concept, is that they aren't typical dungeon crawling and boring games. Your characters develop with almost every click you make. Many options in dialogs, and you are free to do almost anything you want inside the game's borders.(DUAL WIELD)Just a comment for the dual wielding, as many seemed disapointed that there isn't that feat-skill in the game. I know it would be cool to have a 2*1h character, which can attack multiple times, but as it seems the developers didn't implemented it. Was it difficult to make changes in the code they had so far? Was it because they thought 1h is easier than 2*1h to handle (as the offhand has to have some penalties)? Was it because of the game's balance? Either way, with a rogue and a dagger at level 3, you can make 8 backstabs in a single turn. This overflows the gap for me, and makes me laugh.Thank you for your time reading my review.Sincerely,eThi.			"

Early Access Review
								Did you like those late 90s isometric RPGs? Planescape, Fallout? Did you like those games because they felt like a great mesh of adventure game and RPG character building? Well this game gets that feeling spot on. You'll want to solve quests and explore the world not for the sake of ""epic loot"", but because the world is just so well crafted, and the people who populate it are fun to talk to. The quest design is excellent, with long quest chains that involve multiple characters and multiple solutions, rather than being the simple collect x amount of y or fed-ex quests that are expected in modern RPGs; the dialogue is genuinely funny (I recommend taking the trait that lets you talk to animals); and the game actually gives you a chance to use magic for things other than killing people (put out a fire with a rain spell, or set off mines by pouring oil on the ground and setting fire to it)!

Divinity: Original Sin[divinityoriginalsin.com]This Divinity game goes back to its roots. The world is one of the most interactive worlds of every game I know. There are always different ways to solve a quest and you are able to kill ANYONE! In the Alpha only the town Cyseal with its surroundings are accessable but you will have 15+ hours of playtime nonetheless. The combat system makes a lot of fun. Instead of making a mainstream hack'n'slash system, Larian developed a very good balanced round based one. Furthermore the elements play a big role in combat. E.g. you freeze water to ice and your enemies will slip when they walk on it. This game will be a gem (if it is not already). With its old school combat system, the interactive world, the well written dialogues, the typical Larian humor and tons of ways to craft different things, Divinity: Original Sin is a game you should keep an eye out for. It has the heart to do something different and it does it better than a lot of games of the last decade.			"

												After completing the main story line, I can honestly say this was really good game. My thoughts are based on co-op game from top to bottom. Pros:+ Character interactions with each other are well made and bring nice touch to game. It's too seldom when you can argue with your co-op partner in these games. But luckily Divinity delivers nicely with this. + Battles are well made and there are plenty of different aspects you need to take into account. Personally I was little disappointed that hardest battles where in the first 20 hours of playing. It might be that towards the end you know the battle system better, or you are overpowered, but I would have hoped last fights would have been a bit harder. All in all battles are still a huge plus for this game. + Puzzles are challenging and it is fun to complete them, you need to study the environment and lorebooks and talk to other characters. But puzzles are not too hard for you to complete, they just might take some time. Better have a character with good perception, it helps a LOT. +Side quests, a large diversity of different quests, some totally random and some so obvious, but these side quests bring plenty of diversity and they challenge you on different ways than the main story. Cons- Maybe a bit sloppy main story, and it felt somewhat forced. Don't get me wrong, it could have been a lot worse. - We completed the game with the same ""sidekicks"". Once we tried to hire a new hero to our party, but they seemed to be a bit useless, and changing from your normal sidekick to the new one was made little bit annoying, as all the stuff that the other one was carrying needed to be transfered first to your main characters inventory and from there to your new sidekicks inventory.- SPOILER!!!  You can't continue to play with your characters after beating the final boss. Personally i would have liked to return to town as hero and still keep doing some side quests. Rating****/*****			"

												This game came out recently and I've dropped about 20 hours in, so here are my thoughts!In Divinty: Original Sin you play two source hunters who have come to Cyseal to solve a murder. From there, the plot escalates and the setting becomes increasingly varied and interesting. Exploration is a highlight in this game with tons of secrets, quests and character to be found often tucked away in little hidden areas. You are given the chance to create both source hunters at the start of the game. Original Sin follows a classless system that encourages minor multiclassing without becoming a jack of all trades, as certain enemies are immune or even absorb certain elements.The gameplay of D:OS is a highlight and one of the most talked-about features. There are dozens of interesting reactions between spells, skills, status effects and different types of terrain. A charging warrior can slip on ice, a cloud of steam can be zapped to turn into a cloud of static, or a wet, chilled enemy can be frozen on the spot. All of this makes for fun, tactical combat. It initially seems slow but you'll want the time to plan, as the game is incredibly difficult, especially during boss fights are fights against large amounts of enemies. They too use status effects often.Now, for the graphics and sound. The visuals are highly customisable via the settings, allowing the game to run on old machines, whilst also allowing for some impressive visuals and effects on newer rigs. Animations are average, but spell and skill effects look very nice. One negative is the enemy animations. Some get unique effects, but I often saw generic enemy mages using generic animations for spells of different elements, which was boring and a little confusing. The sound is fantastic, the game has high-quality voice acting for both the player characters and NPCs. There's ambient dialogue which repeats a little too often, but has a very charming Fable-like to it. 'Noone has as many friends as the man with many cheeses!' The music is absolutely top-notch in every respect. Eargasms all round.Thank you for reading my review!			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is one of the best RPG's I have ever played on the PC. Larian Studios have really put their heart and soul into this title.The dialogue, voiceovers, and especially the music are all well executed. I very much enjoy the art style of the game, and all of the vibrant colors in the envorinment and abilities.The interaction with spells/abilities and the environment is phenomenal. Cast an oil spell that will slolw enemies, and follow it up by casing a fire spell that does its initial fire damage, and 100% chance to inflict the burning status ailment.Larian Studios' decision to use turn-based combat instead of real-time combat has paid off. You will question your moves on every turn in combat. If there are too many enemies to deal with (within your level range), look around, there is almost always a way to equalize the battles, you just need to have the right tools.The ability to have companions/mercenaries is great. Equip your comrades how ever you see fit, and make them your mule by stashing all your crap in their inventory!* Do note that Divinity: Original Sin only supports 2-player co-op in a drop in/out type of game. At the start of creating a new co-op campaign, you'll create two new heroes. Those two heroes will be the playable characters for you and your friend for the remainder of the campaign. If you wish to reroll, you must start a new co-op campaign with two new heroes! If your friend has to leave for a bit, s/he may log off, and you can do mundane things like sneak around town and pickpocket everyone until they get back! Their character will become AI until they log back into your game.** There is apparently a Divinity: Original Sin 4-player multiplayer mod! I have not tested it, but I'm sure it's awesome!---My rating: 9.3/10			"

												UPDATE JULY 2, 2014  The game has been officialy out for 48 hours now and I have put in 30 play hour's A play trend I cant contine since I need to return to work.  I had no crashing or other major bug issues though I understand some people have had some issues. The most irritating thing is probably the looping dialog which the most recent patch should now have fixed.   As an old school RPG fan this game hits the spot perfectly.  I am playing only the single player version. Combat and exploration requires a small amount of strategy, it is an open world to explore but if your normal play style is to charge and attack you may be frequently frustrated.  Enemy have set levels and may greatly overpower you if you engage the wrong group to soon but you have many options to deal with them and defeating them may be possible with the right strategy or you can simply turn around and find a fight more at your level.     Quest locations are not maped and marked out for you, you will have to explore and find them, despite my 30 hours of play I dont feel I have gotten very far into the game yet and at this point I couldnt tell you what the main quest line is in the game there are several important issues that need resolving and perhaps they all tie in.  Addmitiedly I havent bothered to look in the quest journal very much yet but I have felt no need except in one case.  So my guide to the game has not been I need to go here and do this but more of can I go here and survive at this point.     The first part of the game dose start out a bit slow since it is in a large city area that needs to be mostly explored in order to do well once you head into the wilds.  There is an issues that for me is minor but could use some work, so far I have found only Two NPC that are scripted there are also hirelings that you can replace them with if you wish but they are not scripted, I am not sure if there are other scripted NPC that can join you but at this point the game could certainly use more veriety there.I would rate this a 9.5 and possible Game of the Year for me.  Below here is my original early access review.This Is one of very few games I didnt wait on for a sale price.  This is an ambitious game and Larian Studios still has thier work cut out for them.  I dont like to spend much time on forum boards or trying to find all the bugs in betas to report them, but I have faith in Larian Studios and I belive they are going to deliver one of the best RPG experiences in years, so I decided to support this on early access.  If your looking to be entertained by polished game play of any sort then I can't recomend you buy this on early access.  The pop up menu to start the game was sized wrong and while I could see three buttons they where cut off and I couldnt read what they did. I tested them and learned the first button was to start the game.  I went into the game set up screen first thing, as I do with all new games to make some adjustments. Pre set graphics and sound seemed fine but I decided to change key binding configurations and several of the buttons on this screen had no text discriptions. After testing the buttons I figured out which ones did what I wanted and had a key binding set up that I desired but once I started the game a loading screen showed me that several of the keys I had set up where used for something else that had not been listed on the key binding page and within the game dialogs would show the original key bindings and not my selected ones as the correct keys to hit.  So I went back into key bindings and set them to default figuring that was the best way to go for now.    In the game I had some difficulty with controlls, the mouse would scroll the screen as expected when I moved curser to the edge of the screen except when I moved it to the center of the bottom area, in order to scroll down I had to either hit the down arrow key or move the pointer to the left or right side of the bottom of the screen.  Next I was confused by what I expected from normall left click movement. I was not sure at points if this was terrain I couldnt walk on or a realy buggie AI but them I accedently clicked on a region that was on the other side of a fairly long cliff and my characters went thier on thier own very smoothly.  After fooling around with movement for awhile I learned that single clicking on near by locations would frequently result in buggy or no movement while distant locations worked well and holding down left click to move worked well.    After that things went fairly smooth.  There was an easy combat, then I found a city and was amused by the caracter dialog exchange, In single player there is an option to have each of your character be able to take part in conversations similar to how it will be in multi player.  After a few conversations I decided to explore randomly looking for something to fight I ran into a pack of skelletons that where to powerful for me so I fled then I ran into a pack of orcs that where to powerful for me and fled then on a whim I blasted some guards with a fireball and fled.  That was about the end of my play session and I doubt I will play to much more before the full game release.  So if this sounds dreadful to you do not buy this early access, unless like me you have faith that a polished final product will eventually be delivered and want to throw in your support. I  do not regret buying this game at this point, it is no more then I expected.Just an update since the game has moved into beta all of the issues above have been cleared up, the game dose seem to now be in a more enjoyable playable state, but it is to early for an overall review as there are still many bugs that need polish.

												Divinity: Original Sin (D:OS) serves as a testament to counter the culture of modern gaming.  Larian allowed nothing to hinder their vision for their creation; their love for games and the players who enjoy them serves as the greatest foundation in the making of D:OS.  From gameplay, design philosophy, dedicated patches post-launch, Larian has such confidence in their product because they have faith that their players would appreciate their steadfast, dedicated approach than cave in to the poison of modern culture.Whether you love or hate Divinity, one could not deny the amount of love, respect, and effort Larian put into this game.  It's an example that anyone should  be following in their daily lives.As a result, D:OS performs marvelously on all fronts.Graphics: It's a CRPG, so let's set the bar realistically.  Rivellon in D:OS is simply gorgeous.  The colours and art bring out the atmosphere of the locations.  Weather effects are sharp and clear.  Spell and weapon effects are a charm to behold.  The attention to detail and polish makes this play like a modern game.Sound/Voice Acting/Writing: The sound effects are solid.  There is nothing I do in game where the sound effects were inappropriate or unconvincing, from combat to walking through different weather terrains.  Not all NPCs are voiced, but when they are it is definitely well written and acted out convincingly.  Voice acting was always a strength when it came to Larian's games and I really did wish that there were more of them in D:OS.Writing is another one of Larian's strongest skills.  Taste in writing is subjective.  The two previous games share this trait and D:OS doesn't escape this formula.  Unlike them, most of the writing is read rather than voiced.  It doesn't make the writing any less effective, yet the voice acting in the previous games also displayed the skills of the voice actors and how Larian will not attempt at anything less than stellar. Music: Although taste in music is subjective, you cannot accuse Larian for doing their soundtracks poorly.  The quality is excellent.Story Progression: The beauty about how this game works is the content comes to you the more you talk to people.  The more people you talk to, the more quests you get, the more variety of solutions to solve quests open to you.  Character abilities could be enhanced through dialogue.  It also gives you the freedom to kill quest givers, emphasizing on the lack of hand holding in this game.  For those who complain about the main story progression is in reality linear and how it is pretending to be open world, I might need to remind you that Dragon Age: Origins was also linear in spite offering 5 factions to recruit.  In addition, in Fallout: New Vegas you were not advised to take the shortest path to get to Vegas from the beginning.  I loved both games and they both failed at attempting to make the main story feel non-linear.Combat: Combat is turn based, and that is subjective.  The use of environment as a key addition to your tactics, however, is worthy of praise.  The game encourages you to make good use of all the elements at your disposal so you are capable of winning a battle you would not otherwise win by capitalizing the terrain.  If the terrain is not in your favour, the option of making your own environment is there.  The doors of variety are open, making every battle a different one.  DRM/Microtransactions: It has no reason to exist.Free Companion DLC: This action is extremely pro-consumer and it speaks volumes of how Larian treats their players.  These two members give your party a good mix up and adds variety to the game.  Larian had no reason to do this for free, but they wanted players to have more experiences than less.Kickstarter Success: Larian proved to us that they are very capable of not cheating money that came from good faith.  Given the amount of abuse and horror stories from many developers that failed to create a game to live up to the expectations or simply scammed the contributors, D:OS is a beacon of example.All said and done, no doubt this is a 10/10, right?No.  I adore the game and it's my favorite game of the year, but it's not a 10/10.  D:OS does so many things right so well that it's all the more glaring when it does something wrong.Character Customization: Due to how the character progression is designed in D:OS, hybrids can easily become mediocre if points are allocated wrong.  This limits one's creativity and encourages pures to be made due to simplicity and efficiency.  Despite that, pure builds also have a problem from the inaccessibility to crucial spells.  The best example is the Two Handed Knight.  Both AoE attacks are very limited in the game.  One of them can only be selected through character creation.  The other one comes very scarcely.   Respec removes all abilities you have, thus you cannot make any errors on an AoE Knight.  How could handicapping a build and punishing trial and error exist here? Players won't know any of this information unless they read up all the info before hand.RNG: Although it's a necessary system, this makes an already slow game even slower.  Players want all the legendary gear vendors sell and will reload the game over and over until they find the pieces they want.  Vendors reset their inventory every level and thus this happens with multiple vendors on every level up.  Any loot-able source that can drop legendaries will have the player reloading the game until a desired piece drops.Crafting:  As wonderful it may be to see that there is little hand holding and the abundance of freedom, I wish the crafting wasn't so overwhelming.  It's annoying to be bombarded with so many different items and have little idea regarding how to use them.  I don't want the game to be simple, but it would've been great if there was something to point players towards the right direction.What do all have in common?Time Consumption: The above factors all contribute to many very time consuming activities in addition to the 80 to 100 hours it requires to finish the game.  The game is marvelous in its own right indeed, yet when it demands this much time from its players it's vital to make the experience as efficient as possible.  Let's face it, we all have a limited of time each day to play games due to real life commitments, and Larian needs to figure out how to make the most use of our time when we offer it.  It's frustrating to be engaged in a game for hours just to find yourself accomplishing little.What's even more tragic is that Larian had no intention of doing this.  They embraced all the ideas they wanted in a great game, worked so diligently to create a masterpiece, and yet in oversight their creation caused a dilemma that would've easily destroyed games of lower caliber.  That proves just how powerful and brilliant D:OS is.  When you're doing stuff it feels like DA: Origins.  When it doesn't it leave you hungering more for what could have been if the pacing was more efficient.  I believe it could potentially surpass DA: Origins with the last stroke of polish.Regardless of these flaws, due to my adoration to Divinity, I'll be giving all the time that's required of me to experience D:OS thoroughly.  However, not everyone will be compelled to give Larian such grace, and this notion hurts the presentation of the game.  No one can justify why there's little to no progress in a game after putting hours of their free time into it.I pray that there are upcoming DLCs and detailed patches that could remedy the issues.  D:OS was ever so close to perfection.Final Verdict: 8.7/10 (How I wish this was a 9/10)This package of love, respect and care is only $40.  Support Larian for what they do and there will be hope that their next Divinity game will outperform Original Sin.  They are real risk takers, unafraid to make whatever they feel is fun, and have the integrity, talent, character and dignity to back it up.			"

												Beat the game last night... My overall thoughts:Pros:- It's a classic RPG style game in our modern day of gaming. Yay!- Decent enough graphics for what it is.- Good length to the game - doesn't end 6 hours after purchase like so many titles do nowadays.- Interesting changes in terrain and level design.- Interesting use of elemental interaction for spells.- Love the allowance of coop play. It's nice to have an RPG I can play with my partner.Cons:- Dialogue/story is overly verbose and unnecessarily convoluted. Everyone has countless paragraphs to babble on through when the message is often very simple. I get that it's meant to be old-timey fantasy speech, but plenty of other RPGs succeeded in that feel without dragging on text forever.- Lot of game crashing bugs still. I'm running 64-bit Windows 7 on a top end custom built computer, so I truly believe there are no issues on my end (heck, I run everything else just fine on ultra settings).- Lot of bugs and glitches in general, actually.- NPCs dialogue spam (particularly in Cyseal) is just obnoxious.- If my partner is initiating dialogue, why can't I just read it with him? I can get past this using the Journal or whatever, but why can't I just flipping see it like in any other game if I'm standing RIGHT THERE? Stupid. Oh, and aforementioned NPC spam does not help this issue.- Combat seems to become repetitive upon reaching higher levels. You end up using the same tactics against enemies, and none of them really pose a challenge once you have your resistances set up. Seems mostly a game of ""Who can stun lock who the longest?!""- Crafting and inventory system could use several improvements. - Really bad loot system. - Broken achievements.- And my least favorite thing of this game - Rock paper scissors to determine winner when it came to dialogue debates (intimidate, charm, reason) as opposed to rolling checks like DnD style based on stats. Made me nerdrage to the max having to go through that crap over and over and over again.... and so on and so forth. I could make a bigger list or go into further detail, but I think this gives a good summary of my beef with it. I'm disappointed. Divinity: Original Sin could have been a great game. In fact, it's style of play is one of my favorites in gaming, and yet it falls short due to all its bugs and game design choices. I have no idea how the developers could have even remotely seen some of their decisions as good. I ultimately rate this title around a C- due to my lack of enjoyment in story, end game combat, and due to the amount of game breaking bugs.			"

								I bought this game yesterday, downloaded it, fired it up for a quick 5 minute peek before going to bed for the night.6 hours later it was close to 5am, and I was torn between logging off for an hrs kip before getting up for work, or just playing through.I haven't played an RPG that sucked my life away so effectively since Baldur's Gate essentially redefined the genre over 15 years ago.  At the time of writing, the game is still in early access, and it is a truely excellent experience.   With the exception of turn based combat, the game is entirely free flowing, and the mechanics really truly and honestly finally give you the option to approach a situation in pretty much any way you can conceive of.  Every thing you do, from quests to minor 2 line encounters with npc's feel fluid, and for the first time since a certain ranger yelled ""Go for the eyes Boo!"", I feel like a dev has finally gotten the humour right.Divinity: OS is simply amazing, and if you enjoy RPG's, you need to add this one to your cart immediately.Do I recommend this game? absolutely, most emphatically, yes!

												By far and away, the most fun I've had out of a modern RPG in a very, very long time... and that's no surprise, because it has much more in common with classic RPGs than those that have been released these past few years.It's as if the developers took the best bits of the Baldur's Gates and Neverwinters, added a splash of Dragon Age, and finally trimmed the edges and polished the embellishments. All that, on top of the fact it seems it was designed from the ground up with a co-operative multi-player system in mind, such that the game doesn't suffer at all if you play it alone, but if another player is present, it effects every part of the game in a positive way.There are very, very few games that I will give an unreserved recommendation for, but this is one of them, because I feel that if you've played Divinity: Original Sin and don't enjoy it, then you're probably an alien lizard wearing a human's skin, and you should be out conquering our planet not playing computer games anyway :P			"

								Great game, but it is very much still in alpha. Co-op and companions literally just got implemented in todays live build, and the character customization is littered in 'Disabled in Alpha' features. Besides that, from the time I spent I enjoy it immensely, the animations are truly wonderful, combat is great turn based fun, and the world is immense and so open ended. Like the Deus Ex style of quest solving. Highly recommended.			"

Loving the map + custom placemarkers just like in the old days.

												If i had to sum up this game in one sentence it would be: ""If I teleport this dude here, electrify that puddle, I should be able to control this crowd long enough... *gets shot with an arrow*.... DAMN BLEED Y U CONNECT ME TO THE ELECTRIFIED PUDDLE""+ side:*Very deep and original game mechanics (if you like D&D, this game is for you).*Nice story and art direction.*Nice art, very few CTDs (though they tend to annoyingly happen when you are about to forget about them).*Class and character customisation.*Item stats, diverse enough to really make you wonder which item you should use over another.*Good replay value since the game can be replayed with totally different player choices.*Coop can be a bit weird, but still really fun.*Larian Grade humor material.*Connected to the other Divinity Games.-side:*Item appearance, very limited appearance customisation with armors (the lvl 5 basic plate has the same appearance as the lvl 20 unique one, which is unforgivable!)*Easy to get stuck as Larian Studio is a master at devilish puzzles! Or just get lost, not knowing where to go.*As in Divinity 2, level is everything: if you are one level under the enemies, you are usually in for a hard fight, but if you overpower them by at least a level, the fights become way more simple. This allows the player to know where to go, but also feels very punishing.*Rewards are exploitable through quicksave >.< (and this makes the game a looooooooot easier)*Saddly the modding community for this game didn't seem to pick up though there is a real potential.Having played this game since it was available on steam, having seen it grow from an edgy rock into this fine jewel, I recommend this game. A first blind playthrough with a friend is also recommended :D8.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								First of all my background.. i've played games/rpg's/jrpg's since back in the snes days of lufia and chrono trigger.. also crpgs since before baulders gate lol.As of the beta update this imo is one of the best isometric party based rpg's of all time... the only thing that will hold this back is budget and size from eclipsing even baulders gate or the original fallout. So if you like those games go ahead and buy it now.Graphics... As of the beta update the graphics are awesome.. especially for a kickstar crowdfunded game based on thier own in house engine which heck how many devs just rent an engine these days.. The art and graphical style isn't as cartoonish as wow but maintains that vibrant colerfull look.. completely opposite the drab muddy look i personally hate in games. Spell effects are awesome and when you zoom all the way in its really nice with depth of field and Ambient occlusion and smaa anti alaising.. basically all the goodies one expects in a modern graphics engine. Really have no complaints in this department. (And i am a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥).Combat.. You control up to a party of 4.. 2 main char's then 2 hired char's which have backstories and can be leveled and equipped just as your main's yet if they die they are gone.. you gotta go find another to hire somewhere.. they are more than just henchmen.. they are companions. this along with summons and you can potentially be controlling 6 char's at once for a period of time during combat.. its turn based combat  All i can say is way to hit the nail on the head in the turn based combat.. i was never really a fan of D&D based rulesets and the drab nature of the spells and such in those games yet don't get me wrong i still loved them.Divinity OR gives you that great tactical turn based combad of old yet breathes new life into them with more colorfull and just plain fun array of spells and skills to use.Your actions during a particular turn are based off action points ... every skill requires a certain amount (which you regain them based on talents and the way you build your char every turn).. moving requires them... using items .. moving an oil barrell over to some enemies so your wizard can in turn cast a fireball and blow em to crap.. ya u can do that.. more on that later.. all based on these action points and on top of that they also have a cooldown based around so many turns.. one spell maybe u can use again in 4 turns another in 1 or 2 .. between the two systems and the amount ot skills/spells you have a ton of diversability.The elements:  Every element reacts with the others... rain whether by spells or natural puts out fire and makes enemies/char's wet.. then they  can be frozen via ice spells then shattered by your meelee char's yet are more resistant to fire... fire spells can catch enemies on fire.. Rain can make puddles which can be hit with an ice spell to freeze the puddle so enemies fall.. or you can cast lightning into said puddle to stun/electrocute enemies.  Oil slicks can be ignited by fire... etc etc..The combat is good enough to make you want more combat instead of dreading combat. I believe even a person who is usually turned off by turn based combat would like this.Gameplay.. Everything in the world is interactable.. move things around.. destroy them.. stack them.. etc etc..The loot system is great.. you have many equipable slots and find many different variety of items along your journies that all can have many substats... magical properties .. this is common in many games these days just feel good in knowing larian didn't mess it up.. its done well in this game. Nothing really new with it just done well and not broken.Its a quest based game yet its not WoW.. no quest markers and the such.. back to the roots with a quest log and using your brain here... your told general directions/ideas then its up to you to figure out the rest. Quest log is done very well and also you have a dialoug log and recipe log and that brings me to crafting.Crafting is ingenious in this game.. you just combine items in your inventory and see what you get simple as that... (there are more complex crafting later which really in the game is blacksmithing which you use an anvil and furnace and other things in the game world but its the same principle drag item from inventory to said anvil and vice versa no immersion breaking crafting menus and the such).. Example 1.. combine knife with pumpkin and you get a jackolatern which turns out to make a good temporary helmet early in game... or hammer with cooking pot for similar effect..(and you actually have in game models for all these strange combinations so you run around with a pumpkinhead) nails with branch for a basic spiked club... arrowheads with shafts which you make by combining knife with tree branch.. then mix up some poison by combining certain mushroom with empty vial then apply poision to arrowhead first then you have poison arrow so simple yet thats what makes it so great. its based on logic not some magic formula that doesn't make sense.Dialoug is handled well also... .. there is choice and consequence but i have yet to see long term effects as we only have 25 percent of the game. Surrounding dialoug are the reasoning skills such as charm intimidate reason and so forth that is a dice roll based on your stats in the background which is a staple these days and nothing new yet as before rest assured larian hasn't messed it up or broken it. Now what they have done is put conversations between your two main chars (for co-op which i wont review as i've not experianced it yet but its built around a very sound principle and others seem to love it).. but you actually talk to yourself and discuss certain in game events with other main char.. seems silly but it works as you can think of them as another person in real life you know and answer for them accordingly and it effects certain background traits such as... romantic vs pragmatic and this will have an effect on these char's relationship and the story later on. there is really no right or wrong but this adds a depth to the two main char's that isn't achievable just through scripted chit chat between them like in most games. (If you don't fancy talking to yourself..you can select an A.I for your other char for these conversations but you still control them in combat)  Exploration is fantastic in this game... loot galore yet not meaningless as in diablo... such a huge map to explore just in the beta which is only 20 percent of the game.. Sound.. i'm not too into game music but lets just say its not bad enough for me to notice it and it blends very well with the game atmosphere.. its composed and relaxing and soothing and fits the tones of the in game events at the time. Spells have nice effects and sound stereo instead of monotone.Char Development.... Completely free and classless .. enough said lol.. Many talents to choose from along with stat point allocation and many many diverse skills/spells to learn/purchase broken up into schools... as well as warrior/ranger/rogue skills  for those that like that style of play. Stat points are spent on the norms.. int str dex ...etcSkill points are spent on schools/disciplines or on personality stats such as barter/leadership .. etc or on the norms like lockpicking crafting blacksmithing... its all done very well and fits together and exactly what one who likes this  type of game would want.Hold alt key to highlight items in game world is tied directly to the perception stat and how many points you put in it.. enough said.. the fact larian had enough sense to do this tells you alot.Conclusion: They have done what i thought would never be done again with the route gaming has takn . .Simple as that. The perfect blend of exploration/old schoolness/tactical and turn based yet feels full of action/quest based gameplay i've been waiting for since the infinity engine days.			"

								In D:OS it's not long before I forget what quest I am on and find myself miles away in the wild wondering what I am doing, or spending an hour looking for some useful ingredient. From the get go I just felt like going in some direction and the world which I could access is littered with items and events. When it comes to a dialogue decision, you are often given a dilemma and it is designed well to make two people have a conversation - or argument - about said decision. I found the options were never black and white and I never found myself thinking about quest rewards, which is unusual.As a kickstarter backer, I was pleased with the alpha and Larian is certainly open to feedback. I believe they have a good vision and are interested in preserving the essence of the game.			"

Posted: August 16, 2014
												This game reminded me strongly of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, though with true turn-based combat and more humor. Instead of creating an entire party of adventurers, though, you only create two (you can pick up two more pre-made companions of pretty much any configuration later on). Overall, I think the developers did a great job, and the few nitpicks I have with it will hopefully be addressed with patches or mods later on. For me, the game's main appeals are the strategic combat and the vibrant level designs. Almost every combat was interesting--just around the time you start getting bored, you'll gain a level and some new abilities or weapons to freshen things up (as will the monsters). My first playthrough was maddeningly difficult because I chose a rogue as my main character and, worse, tried to explore a harder part of the map before I was ready. In general, you should find areas where the monsters are the same level as your party. I find that even a single level difference will make the combat frustrating if not infuriating, with the mobs resisting pretty much anything you throw at them. Unfortunately, it's not always clear where you should or can go next, so you might need to resort to a walkthrough or quest guide occasionally to make sure you haven't missed something important. I know a lot of ""hardcore"" types were responsible for the lack of guidance in this game (it was Kickstarter-funded), but a bit more detail in the quest log sure wouldn't have hurt anything in my opinion.I ended up starting over with two fighter types, a wizard, and an archer, and ditched the rogue. Unlike most CRPGs, lockpicking isn't a big deal here, and any character can be trained to do thief skills anyway. I found stealthing and backstabbing to be more trouble than they were worth, and there's no dual wielding. I liked my archer much better. The only real complaint I have is the pace of the battles. Inexplicably, there is no slider bar for ratcheting up spell animations and the like. After you've seen the same 4-second winding-up animation for the hundreth time, you may be yearning for a way to skip over them. I actually found myself getting up to refill my tea during combat, and the computer still wasn't finished taking its turn when I got back. Another vital tip is to learn shields as soon as possible. It wasn't clear to me what these were, since they are titled something like ""fire resistance shield,"" which makes it sound like they're just good for, well, resisting fire. To the contrary, they'll protect you from anything, but have bonues and penalties associated with the element. Another major concern are ""surfaces,"" such as oil slicks, water puddles, blood, poison gas, and so on. These will often react quite violently to elemental effects, and can easily destroy your own characters if you aren't very careful. I found myself just taking lightning bolts and such off my quick bar, since most of the time I just stunned my own characters with them. Still, overall I enjoyed this game very much and looked forward to playing it more. It's been awhile since I had to stop playing a game because I was too sleepy, rather than too bored, to coninue. If you liked Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale back in the day, this is about as close to that experience that I've been able to find in a modern release. Enjoy!			"

												Cons:The inventory system can be frustrating because there are LOTS of things to collect, but: a) no sorting options; b) no \'shift + click\' option so you can work with more than one item at a time.Pros:- The storyline is solid. A little mystery, a couple of big hit surprises, and unusual characters involved in different ways. - There is a good amount of variety in settings, ranging from rocky, to green, to frosty, to morbid, etc.  This plays into the environmental & elemental effects system well; and the quests are often particularly suited to the setting. - Gameplay is loads of fun.  A good mix of playing around with characters abilities (especially trying out different combinations between party members), turn-based strategy, and making use of environmental effects.- Maybe not for everyone, but what I really loved about it was the way I would often die in a battle and, rather than come back later after gaining a few levels, could just replay it trying a different strategy and win.  Sometimes the battles went absolutely terribly the first time; badly a couple more times; then ended up in a win... Trying out different strategies made the gamplay unique; and winning after such a challenge is hugely satisfying.- A decent range of abilities and character builds.  Not amazing variety, but good.- Some very different \'bosses\' that require tackling in different ways.One of the most enjoyable games I\'ve played in the last 10 years; and WELL ahead of all the stale 3D first person actioners.

This is a game for those who like exploring, who don't like being treated by the devs like complete brainless sheep. This is a real old school RPG coated over in modern graphics.+ There are no quest markers.+ Graphics which are very pleasent to the eye.+ Best turn-based combat ever.+ Very fun magic spells.+ Funny dialogue - there were a few ROFL moments.+ Amazing soundtrack!- I think it will end one day and i shall shed a tear.

												Divinity Original Sin is a great Crpg made by Larian Studios. The story takes place in a fantasy world, Rivellon, like the rest of the franchise. The two main protagonists are source hunters, but there is more to them than meets the eye. And little do they know of the importance of a quest they must undertake that will affect the world. Like in all grand epics the source hunters start off with a routine murder case, and what they discover that day will change them. The story in Divinity Original Sin is one full of twists and turns that will not disappoint. This game has a plethora of colorful characters/villains that will make you both laugh and cry. Your companions (if you choose to have them), have plenty of well thought out backgrounds. Their sidequests tie well with their stories and are entertaining. The game may have a few misspellings here and there but has plenty of depth worthy of your attention. The graphics and art of Divinity Original Sin are top notch. You are also hit with enjoyable music that sets the tone on your adventures. When you start playing, you are immediately immersed by the beauty of this world. It is a welcomed sight to have so many well placed details in this game. But don't take my word for it, let us ""Rock-paper-scissors"" it. The difficulty of this game is to my liking. There will be plenty of quicksaves and quickloads that will go throughout your many battles. There are puzzles that you will spend hours on and will say, ""Oh, that's where the switch was the whole time."" Yes people, using different fields of view will be your best friend on this journey. In Fact lest I forget, the game also encourages using the field to your advantage during battles. This is one gem that I would recommend to friends and family alike. I hope the people in the steam community who haven't played this game or have just given up on it, will give Divinity Original Sin the chance it rightly deserves. This game will not lead you by the hand, and you will appreciate it all the more for solving/winning the game under your own power. Happy gaming.			"

Early Access Review
								(Warning: Looong)First, some background.  Somewhere around December 20th, 2011, I discovered the Divinity series.  I was young, naive, thinking every game on Steam was a great one.  I could have easily been burned, badly.  But I wasn't.  In Divinity 2: The Dragon Knight Saga I found a true gem.  While I never got very far, and I eventually forgot about it for a while, I always knew in my heart that it was a good game.  Fast-forward some time, and I, now more wizened to the terrors of bad games, find that Divinity 2: Developer's Cut had come out.  I wanted to buy it, but to my surprise, I already had it!  The people I would soon come to know as Larian Studios had given me a free copy, just because I bought their game some time ago!  I was stunned.  Right then and there, I said to myself, ""These fine people have earned a customer for life!""  Oh, but what was to come.Sometime in early 2013, as I was perusing the forums as I am wont to do, I happened to glance at a post for a Kickstarter.  I had heard of KS before that; even almost purchased something.  I would've just passed it by, but something caught my eye.  As you might have figured out by now, that Kickstarter was for none other than Larian's Divinity: Original Sin.  It was then that those old memories of searching through goblin-filled tunnels and flying as a dragon came screaming back to me.  Soon it was all I could think about; how I could get money to buy it, what the process for doing so was, even possibly what the game was going to be like.  Soon, it was a done deal.  I raised a fairly healthy sum (at that point $25, just enough to get the game) and soon had myself neck-deep in chatting with the wonderful people there.  It wasn't long until I felt I wanted more.  Then, like a gift from the Game Gods, I found the Weresheep.  For a measly $6, I could join this order of super-fans!  And so, my sum kept rising and rising, eventually passing $100.  I won't disclose the full number, but it wasn't cheap!Now, with the backstory done, let's get to the actual game.  Currently, the game is in an ""Alpha"" state, as told by multiple warnings throughout the store page and game itself.  So obviously, there will be (and are) bugs, some game-breaking.  Also, with most update the saves become incompatible, so be prepared to start again a lot.The game starts with a pop-up asking you to recognize that it's not finished, content may change, etc.  Once you hit the ""Play"" button, the game itself starts up.  The starting menu is fairly basic, and the menus (last time I checked) are placeholders from their last game, Dragon Commander.  Loading screens can be slow, and are prone to freezing (visually only; it loads after a minute or so).  But once that's all done, the game pops you, without so much as an intro cutscene, into a character creation screen.  It's fairly simple; choose your class (Which is not binding, by the way; it's very free-form) and make them pretty, then you're in.  You're immediately put in control of two characters, Roderick and Scarlett, who have a quick dialog before a box pops up telling you that you can click to walk.  And that's really it for an introduction; you're left to fend for yourself in a land which, admittedly, is not very dangerous-looking.  But the lack of controls isn't a bad thing; the game is fairly simple and the system is quick to pick up.According to Larian, there's a good couple of hours in right now.  I think that's pretty modest.  Depending on how you play, you can spend hours in the city alone.  This is a truly open-world game, a game I like to describe as ""Go anywhere, do anything"".  And no other game embodies that as much as Original Sin.  There are an infinite number of choices; if you think killing everybody and prancing on their graves while drinking a bottle of wine and smashing tomatoes with a hammer is your thing, go right ahead!To sum it up, if Early Access isn't your thing, please, do not buy this game expecting a bug-free experience.  This game can and will break, and spectacularly so.  But if you think you can handle it, dive in, and be prepared to be amazed by the sights and sounds of Rivellon.  Speaking of sounds, by the way, those are done by none other then the great Kirill Pokrovsky, who is a musical genius.  And, thanks to the Kickstarter, he has an entire orchestra at his disposal.  Truly, this music has to be seen, er, heard, to be believed.TL,DR: Game good.  Buy.			"

												I tend to prefer games that hold my hand.  Know the bread crumb trail that everyone hated in Fable 2, yep, I am the guy that loved that.  When I feel lost in a world, I get frustrated.  I just want to know what to do and when to do it.  Divinity doesn't hold your hand.  It is an unforgiving, old school RPG, and it is one of my favorite games of all time.  Things that normally annoy me in other games don't feel like a problem in Divinity.  I want to explore.  I want to find my own path.  I want to spill oil on the ground, knock some barrels in to it, and then set them on fire.  It is nothing like other games that I have enjoyed in the past, and yet it will be a game I look back on fondly for as long as I play games.			"

												Great game, I wish i could dedicate the time it deserves to it. 20 hours into it I had no choice but to switch to easy and consult google about some of the most annoying puzzles. Since every point of XP is so important I felt forced to complete everything there was, even sidequests I had zero interest in and riddles that are just bad and provide no satisfaction when finally figuring it out. Opposite to all the freedom this game offers, for which I loved most of the time I spent with it, the chore to do these 10% of quests I hated finally led to decision not to continue. Combat is getting boring on easy, but normal is way to time consuming for me, because I refuse to quicksave and reload all the time.Maybe I played it wrong, maybe I should have started over at some point when fully understanding all the mechanics, I definitely wasted a few points now and then at the beginning. I probably should have exploited the random loot generation, like it is recommended by many people and I guess playing in 10h sessions during the holidays until early hours doesn´t make puzzle solving any easier. To come to a conclusion of the above rambling: It is one of the best games of 2014 and I also respect the approach to let the player figure out everything the hard way, even if this means that guys like me who haven´t played such hardcore RPGs for a long time probably need to start over after 10-20h. What would have helped in my case would be a difficulty between easy and normal, where I would be able to skip a few things and have challenging battles along the main story line. Visually, the game is splendid and apart from the annoyingly jumping camera I was constantly amazed. Epic story and awesome writing, makes the massive amount of reading surprisingly enjoyable (the abysmal writing in most games recently infected me with the habit to skip through most dialogues and sequences, Original Sin is a welcome antidote) Looking forward to whatever follows, would crowdfund so I could annoy the heck out of the Devs during early development :)			"

												After over 100 hours of gameplay, I finally managed to slog through this game to the end, if only just to say that I completed it. Don't get me wrong, I don't absolutely hate the game; it's just that it more than overstayed its welcome in addition to having significant flaws.First of all, the crafting system is just horrendous. It's extremely unintuitive and tedious. Let's say you want to create a magic scroll. You must first acquire yourself an ink pot and a quill. Good luck with that, because no vendors sell them. I ended up having to steal them from a friendly NPC. You must then combine them by dragging the icon for the quill over the icon for the ink pot, then stand by and watch a progress bar fill, in order to create an ""Ink Pot & Quill"". Now you have to get some pixie dust. Find a bone and grind it to dust using a mortar and pestle; oh yeah, you need one of those as well. Now find a stardust plant and throw it in the mortar and pestle to create stardust. Now combine the bonemeal and stardust to make pixie dust. Now sprinkle some pixie dust on the ink pot and quill to make ""Magic Ink Pot and Quill""! Now find an axe and a log of wood. Hack up the log with the axe to get a few wood chips. Now find a bucket and search all over town for a well. Draw water from the well into the bucket. Combine the water and one pile of wood chips to make one ""Mush of Wood"". Now search all over town for a furnace. Throw the wood mush on the furnace; lo and behold: One sheet of paper! Now kill a dangerous Water Elemental and take its essence. Rub the water essence on the sheet of paper to make a ""Blank Water Scroll"". Now is the moment we've all been waiting for! Use the magic ink pot and quill on the blank water scroll to create... oh, no sorry, your crafting skill is too low. Now go kill dozens of insane demons and level up in order to increase your crafting. Great, can we craft the scroll now? As I was saying, use the magic ink pot and quill on the blank water scroll to create... wait for it... a random, low-level, one-time-use water magic scroll! You managed to do all of this without any indication in game of what you needed to do! Wasn't that worth it guys? The loot in this game sucks. Mainly you will find more ingredients for crafting and lots and lots of vendor trash. It's hard to afford anything in the beginning, but keep picking up those garbage items and dozens of hours later you'll be swimming in gold! Which goes back to my previous point: why would you craft anything when the items you craft are inferior to the gear you will inevitably have already found by the time you figure out how to craft anything?I like that this game avoids the ""follow the pointer"" trend in modern video games. However, the game world is quite large and it would be nice if there was some—any—indication of where you need to go without exploring every square inch of the map. Want to know where some place is in town? Too bad you can't just ask an NPC, because they don't have that interaction programmed in. Want to delve further into your current quest objective in order to understand what it is you're trying to accomplish? Too bad, because the one relevant NPC can only tell you some generic, fluff dialogue.I could go on, but the final criticism that I want to raise is that the writing is just not compelling. It's one of the most ham-fisted and saccharine takes on the ""world is ending"" trope I've ever seen. It would have been nice if I could just go on adventures with some nuance and intrigue, rather than having to prevent existence from coming to an end by a contrived plot device.Not recommended.			"

I seriously found myself missing the isometric camera view, and this game fed into my hunger even more! :) The social interaction between player characters are well arranged, laws of physics are all over the battle scenes, main plot is interesting, and the game world is very rich. Using Rock-Paper-Scissors to decide arguments between parties is both humorious and imaginative, and it was my favorite part in the game. I strongly recommend the experience to all RPG lovers! This game is a must :)			"

												This is the first of its kind for me. I've never really played a similar game. At first the fact that it's turn-based may seem like a turn-off (hehe) but that's not really the case. The turn based combat definitely does not feel slow most of the time. Sometimes the number of enemies getting turns in a row requires a little bit of wait. However, this ties in well with a mention of status effects. You quickly learn how to effectively freeze, stun, or knock-down enemies. I found I used these a LOT more than simply slowing, cursing, or lowering the attributes of an enemy force, those effects I'm sure are more necessary on hard (I played on normal) but the results are a little more subdued. The great benefit to me for the first list of statuses is that it means you don't have to wait for 5 enemy zombies to move in a row, hurray! One thing that was annoying at first but learned to avoid and appreciate later was avoiding stunning my own forces with various air/lightning spells. Sometimes I would think a unit was in the clear because she was near but not next to an enemy force but would still get stunned. I learned later on the usefulness of putting a fair number of points (and wearing appropriate gear) into the various Body Building and Willpower (or wearing armor with some form of immunity instead of just grabbing the highest armor value). Of course, this was a little easier to splurge on with the Secrets vendor exploit still in place.Later on in the game it's very easy to just buff up armor/elemental resistance and go to town and watch enemies fail to do a lot of damage. Some late game enemies were actually somewhat interesting in this regard because they rely on brute strength of a few units rather then an ambush where you have to worry about engaging on multiple fronts for a larger number of enemies. I actually had to change my strategy a bit here since I really only had 1 person able to take many hits from them and my other units (2 mages and an archer) were simply too squishy for the heavy physical damage. Luckily I had two people capable of teleporting them to where they shouldn't be to help keep things in check. The game emphasizes strategy, but it's also incredibly unbalanced, which can be a benefit but is sometimes an annoyance.The Act 1 boss fight was the first example of the game teaching me the great value of positioning (rather than just forgoing it since it was previously not something that I needed to worry about.) Early in the game, I could more or less simply turtle, buff/debuff, and then focus fire target by target until there were no more targets left. The four foes in that boss fight just do not go down that fast, so I needed to make smart use of summons, teleporting both the enemies and myself, and really paying attention to the turn order. Seems like basic stuff but up to that point I didn't need to be as focused, and instead would just analyze what should be done as unit turns rolled instead of any long-term planning.Unfortunately, the level of that fight was never really met again until the penultimate boss fight. From the second map on, I had a pretty great rotation of summons, buffs, and engaging that I really didn't need to deviate from. Most of the mid game boss fights I didn't even need to worry about whatever the mechanic was for the fight. King SPOILER had an interesting elemental mechanic but was long dead before I even had to worry about it. Maybe I should have played the game on hard, but in act one Normal seemed like a great balance. I probably should have switched but in the middle of progressing through the game the ease of combat first feels empowering instead of boring. I guess that's what second playthroughs are for SOMEDAYThe last part of the game really dragged on for me and soured me a little bit. I was traversing the last area and would actually loathe seeing red dot enemy blobs since they were just wasting time. I suppose a consequence of the long run time of the game itself as well as the rote-ness that encounters had become by that point. The only interesting encounters in that area involved the a certain goblin enemy type since they were so tanky and I couldn't just take them out quickly. So instead I would wipe out all their friends and then just peg them down slowly or less slowly, far past to point of them being an actual threat. I really enjoyed the encounters around Cyseal and Hunter's Edge because the battles felt meaningful and paced between quest progression. The red dots in that final area and to a lesser extent, Hiberheim, it just felt like I was a cartographer scraping the edges of the map and clearing it out just for a sense of completion. One of my gripes with the combat system, as as been mentioned by others, is that sometimes it's easy to ""miss"" a target if his idle animation moves him out from underneath your cursor and you end up walking up to give him a hug rather than attack. I wonder if a toggle for a snappy cursor would be a possible implementation. Sometimes you can click on the enemy portrait or zoom and wiggle the camera but a lot of times there are many enemies of the same time and you're unsure which portrait is his, and for me moving the camera can sometimes mess with my mental map.The pet talking talent is super useful, and putting it on one of my source hunters was the only real piece of advice I went into the game with. I see a lot of talk about people restarting to try to perfect their characters while I just went with a long laundry list of imperfections that made the game somewhat interesting. It will be interesting enough to see people speed run (fewest turns possible) some of the bosses (assuming at the same level) to see what sort of truly overpowered builds people can create.I only wish the game threw a couple more talents your way. Some of them seems crazy useful (Leech) while others seemed like a somewhat waste of points.I didn't really like most of the indoor dungeons, I liked the encounters in the outside areas a lot more, generally (not in the phantom forest). The indoor areas mostly just felt like corridors filled with baddies or rooms filled with switches. The pixel hunt puzzles were so very grating. The area near where you fight a story boss in a library is especially memorable, as well as hidden buttons in the Dark Cove and the last dungeon. I didn't like the last set of puzzles much at all, until the very last part, which was nice but too easy. A hard thing to balance, surely. Either the solution seems a little obtuse or it's spelled out and feel like it's wasting your time. While I say I didn't really like them, it was still more interesting than finding a switch tucked away somewhere. Not really a puzzle but something I'm reminded of are the reason/charm/intimidate skill checks. I really don't like the rock paper scissors implementation at all.I never really found the need or desire to save scum for loot. I guess mainly because the crafting/upgrading of equipment is easy enough, and the importance skills and tactics is MUCH more important than whatever you are wearing. I recall not replacing Jahan's initial staff until he was level ~14 and I realized my Scarlett had a level 5 cap and boots until very near the end of the game. You could beat the game naked. If they fix the issues with the low level loot dropping from higher level areas, then I really don't have much of any problem with it. It doesn't bug me that I might have an old piece of equipment stick around since since I never happened to find a replacement. You make due with what you get.The artstyle and whole tone of the game is definitely pleasant. The exuberant and over-acted mannerisms of some of the npcs definitely set the tone of the game early on. The environments are great, and the music is fitting, and areas like the Temple of SPOILER are haunting as they should be. Sometimes the character models don't look super when zoomed close, but that's minor.			"

												I've been playing this off and on since the Early Access version went live on Steam. To say that this game, which even in Early Access looked amazingly promising, has come a long way in its development by Larian Studios would be an extreme understatement.At the beginning, you get to develop two characters that will be your primary PCs for your trip through quite an extensive world. Even in just the beta a large chunk of the world was available, now that the full release is finally here, that world is much, much larger now. You can mix and match your starting skills to create anything you might want, from caster, melee, ranged, as well as other things such as making your mage a suave charismatic leader, or your rogue a pickpocket and thief who then turns around and sells the items back to their owners for even more than they are truly worth. Creation of your characters alone can take some time, as the possibilities are near endless.Starting off, the game has obviously had a lot of work put into it. There is a nice tutorial dungeon that does a good job explaining the basics of combat and miscellaneous actions, such as how to deal with traps, pressure plates, locked objects (I love how you can just destroy them if you don't feel like trying to pick the lock, or simply don't have a key) and even then, that's only some of the important mechanics of the game. Your dialogue interactions greatly influence your skills, as you develop traits based on your decisions which can influence combat and social skills by a small amount.Got a friend? Larian has developed a drop in / drop out style of co-op that one can play. Two PCs, two players, you and your friend can create and control one character each, or they can simply drop in and take control of your second PC. It definitely is an interesting system for co-op, and jumping into a game is extremely simple between friends.Even though it says about 25 hours played for the beta, I probably spent close to 50 while in offline mode, and even with all of that time, it still is amazing. Looking forward myself to playing through the entire world now, and I hope that if you purchase this, you'll see just why this game has such amazing potential and enjoyment to be had.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is a mixed bag. There are plenty of positive reviews out there. I personally enjoyed the game enough to beat it, but I will be focusing on the negative.  The main reason for this is there are many mechanics in the game that are frustrating as a player and I think people should at least be aware of these issues. And if RPGs already aren't your cup of tea, these issues are probably enough to make it unenjoyable.Divinity: Original Sin goes out of its way to be misleading, time wasting, and obtuse. If you're someone who enjoys not looking at a wiki when playing a game, you'll be hard pressed to do that with this game. I'll begin with a list of scenarios that have happened to me and then go into more depth. This may come across as nitpicky, but the more you play the game the more you realize scenarios like this are fairly common.In one particular boss fight, I struggled for 2 minutes trying to align my mouse perfectly so I could actually hit the boss. The hitbox of enemies doesn't match the actual sprite, sometimes it is much smaller. This is a problem when the screen gets cluttered and you have multiple people wailing away at a boss. Sprites also move in an ""idle"" animation while the game is waiting for you to make your moves, causing the tiny hit box to move around while you're trying to click. If you click at the wrong moment (very easy to do), well you just moved your character, perhaps took a reaction attack from the opponent, moved through poison or fire, and now you can perform fewer actions as you move back to your original spot to try again. Eventually, I figured out the hitbox was essentially a 2x2 grid (almost down to the pixel) centered on the persons head, but it required so much precision I got so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off trying to stab this boss, I just simply reloaded the game and waited for them to move out of the bush before starting combat. You can rotate the camera or press ""b"" to do a top down mode, but sometimes this doesn't help either (though top down works ~99% of the time, but it took about 60 hours and a friend to find out this particular camera angle usually works).I decided to do a temple of trials for a particular quest line. Halfway through I realized the opponents in the temple are too strong for me to deal with at my current level. But there's a certain set of switch puzzles that took an infuriating amount of time. The game leads you to believe that if you try enough pots, barrels, and boxes the switches will open- but no, you can only use activate two of the switches with those. You need a very precise weight to trigger all the switches. That's okay, if I hadn't tried about 100 pots/barrels/boxes before looking at a Wiki to realize the game was just screwing with me at this point. Now you usually can leave areas without any real penalties, but my party contracted rot- which is essentially incurable by normal means and requires a rare item and ticks down your health by 1 health per turn until its cured (to a minimum of 1 health). Now you can use a rare item later in the dungeon, but considering I had to  reenter the temple and reaquire rot to finish the quest later, I decided not to. But this required me to run around the game for 5 hours until I found the relatively rare item to cure the condition (and it only happened because my friend happened to tell me where two were that I missed). In the meantime I had to heal my party about every minute so the rot didn't chunk my health. There's a perception stat that helps you see hidden things, along with making you have a higher crit percent. If only it actually helped you be more perceptive against enemies.  I was derping around a cave and sort of knew some enemies were coming up, so I casted increased sight. Shame it didn't matter, the invisible enemies lurking in the bushes don't trigger until you trigger an enemy in broad sight further up no matter how perceptive your character is. They also can't be hit until they move once. So if you took the main route and kept your party close, you're now horribly flanked regardless of what statistical and personal decisions you made. Your only option is to reload the game and keep your party further back and then agro with a ranged weapon. Why not reward the player for actually planning instead of running semi-scripted battles and reward reloading the game because now you know how its scripted? It feels like most of the challenge from ordinary fights is from these scripted events given where I'm at in the game, and not the actual fight itself.Other major complaints:1. Nearly every fight in the first map involves fire and/or poison. Contracting one of these twice is enough to kill a party member early without healing, and if they come into contact with each other they explode.  The end result is you spend a disprorptionate amount of time running away to remove poison/fire early in the game. There aren't any real countermeasures available early, at least not ones you can afford/waste skill points on. It's nice in small doses, but it seems like the later in the game it gets the more prone my screen is getting coated with hazards from magic spells. If I had a rain spell I could just clear it, but I don't (party choices- too late to turn back, and I can't find a skill book).2. Vendor randomness severely limits your spell and equipment choices. You don't learn spells/skills like a typical RPG where you level up and learn them- you need skill books. Which would be fine, except vendor loadouts change when you level, and if something isn't there, it isn't there. There are some presets or high probability skill books that are almost always there, but the rarer stuff is hard to get. Later in the game there's more vendors which helps alleviate this problem, but you can go through the game and not know a spell even exists until a boss smashes you with it. Some people would argue this increases the replayability of the game, but if I don't read a wiki I don't even know what I'm missing. There's also not an awful lot of choice in the early game, because what you have often comes down to what drops/spawns in dungeons.  Isn't this typically when characters start to differentiate? Leveling didn't feel particularly rewarding as a result.3, The AI is extremely hit or miss. If you reload a game and play a fight, sooner or later the enemies do really derpy things. An example is my friend ignited an oil barrel which caused a plume of smoke around the boss. The boss sat still and burned to death because it couldn't see outside the cloud and the skeletons refused to cross the fire. A boss just sits there while eating projetiles and spells because it can't see? Another fight later has a boss that can summon a quasi-AOE fire spell that can do like 300 damage. Turns out the best way to beat him is to reload until the boss sits around♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥its turns on other stuff and just pray to your deity he doesn't ever use it. I can't help but feel something is being lost when that's the extent of the AI and how I'm using the save/load system.4. I feel like for being a fairly open game, it goes out of its way to force me down a certain path, Which would be fine, but having to wander around until you find monsters that are about your level and just reloading/running away when you don't feels ham fisted. Enemy level spikes don't feel natural, and often I'm unsure where to go becaues its possible to have 10+ concurent quests fairly easily. The game really doesn't prime the player enough by having difficult but barely possible fights to let them know it might be a bad idea to keep wandering down this road.I could go on, but I'm running out of space. Suffice to say there's a lot of flaws in this game, and it tends to compound as the game goes on. There's so many simple improvements that could have been made.			"

												Blood is wet, right?My swordsman was slashing happily away. I gave him a talent that let him heal when standing in blood. My mage used her nifty new staff of air. It does electric damage. I can electrify a whole pool of water and stun enemies. This time, I zapped an enemy standing in a pool of blood and my swordsman got stunned too.Divinity: Original Sin will end up GOTY for many. It has an impressive level of detail. You get a detailed combat system, but one that doesn't suffer from mind-numbing menus. Or you can show off your cooking skills to the other party members anywhere you can find or make an open fire. Crafting is intuitive, just drag and drop anything that looks plausible. A stick makes a feeble weapon, but mine are destined to become poison arrows.Everything moves along rather speedily. Point, click, and a few convenient keyboard commands. The key commands are reconfigurable. The only thing I could find to improve is the inventory system, but that is already better than the competition. And, you can invite people, or let your Steam friends or anyone else auto-join your game - when that happens, inventory management speeds up as you both pick up and pore through your loot after an adventure. You can also adventure separately and, outside the very early game, teleport immediately to rejoin. (I have not tested the multiplayer.) And there is a lot of loot. You might not deign to pick up every apple you find just to make more apple pies, but there are plenty of enchanted and rare items to make you happy. At Normal difficulty you will hardly use any of your consumable items as long as you play carefully.The starting city has vendors in every item category and magic school. And you can boost some deluxe early equipment if you don't mind being shady. Want extra experience? Perhaps there are some guards you don't like whom you can catch alone in a manageable number. They are quick to get in a scrap anyway. Honestly. I didn't even ctrl-click to attack them. Or sometimes I just made an oopsie and someone got slowed and set on fire. If anyone asks questions later, I just blame it on the undead.The music is appropriate and there is plenty of it. Even after dozens of hours you will enter an area and experience what seems like a new mood from the music. Or the music can remind you that you have a bit too much experience setting off traps. You have the option to play with from 2 to 4 characters. You create 2 and the rest volunteer or are hired. There's a well-crafted tutorial. It's totally skippable, but once you've seen it once you might not skip it. You can run through the tutorial area in 10 minutes for some easy starting loot and a splash of experience.And there are modding tools. So you can expect to revisit this game some year for quite a new experience. "

Early Access Review
								**Early Access Impression**I remember the days of Divine Divinity one of my favorite rpgs of all time.  This game brings me back to that.  There are certainly bugs and some unfinished content.  As far as performance goes I have had zero crashes and with all graphics settings maxed out it runs great.  The graphics style they chose to use is really good imho.  I'm loving it so far and would recommend to anyone that enjoys a turn based rpg with a lot of promise.  This is the first early access game I have been willing to try up to this point.  One of the best features about this game is the coop.  I have not had this much fun in a long time.  I would absolutely recommend playing with another person if you have the option and to use some sort of voice chat.  I will try to update this as new updates are released.			"

												The Larian sense of humor is not for everyone. It goes beyond the narratives in the game and extends to 'practical jokes' in the game mechanisms. Where some may find scenes 'charming' I often found them irritating. Where some may find OP enemies 'challenging' I simply thought they were filler forcing the player to waste a lot of time seperating mobs to pick them off one by one. My playtime here is not long because it wasn't much fun. The character builder was joyless. The 'crafting system' was a migraine. Presumably if you persevere and get out of the first town the game should improve. After all this, why a thumbs up? Because we have a duty as gamers to taste all the fruit in the garden. Just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean you won't.			"

												I have commited an unoriginal sin by judging this game before I even played it.Friend: ""Hey dude, check this out!""Me: ""Ah, it's probably not good""WRONG!Divinity: Original Sin is the most fun multiplayer experience I have had in quite a while. You play as two characters that you create known as ""Source Hunters"" in a turn-based RPG game. You have free roam of the world around you filled with story and enemies at every turn. You can play co-op, as the other player creates and takes the role of the second source hunter.STORY:You arrive on a ship to Rivellon. A place filled with Turmoil, under the threat of source. Evil mages are plotting against the world, and it is your job to stop them. As you travel, you will come accross countless side quests for leveling up. Mechanics:It's a free roam game until you spot and or spotted by enemies. Once spotted, imedient turn-based combat begins. this is really fun for working with the other player and formulating a good srategy. Generally I find myself reloading saves quite often because of how difficult the game is. There is such thing as making the ""wrong party"" and screwing up your leveling, each time you level up, you get an attribute (strength, Dexterity, Will, ECT) and rofficiency is weapons, armor, ect.The map is fun, although I will say that for how ""Free"" you are, the game is pretty linear. Anyone who will say otherwise isn't totally wrong either though. You can do whatever quest you want, go where you want, but go anywhere that the enemies are 2 levels above you and you will get *DEMOLISHED* Resistance to stun, poison, prone, and pretty much everything is important in this game. all negative things are deadly. During combat you can use the environment to your advanage. See a puddle? Electrocute the enemy standing it with a shock spell. See a poisonous cloud? Shoot a fire arrow, and it explodes! Is the ground of fire? Break that barrel filled with water to put it out! Is the enemy attacking your mage? use his spell to teleport the enemy on the fire that the water barrel missed. So much strategy in this game. You can learn to abilities by purchasing skill books, and teaching your character new abilities.			"

												A throw back to the classic rpg games we all loved years ago!  Divinity: OS has brought back the ""damn it, I'm late for work"" scenario and it feels so good!  You'll find yourself spending an hour in town looking around, talking to people and looting when all you went for was a simple pickaxe!A beautiful free roam huge open world with turned based combat and no classes, make the character(s) you want to play...customize their look / stats / abilities / traits etc...random loot, a branching story, plot twists, secrets, crafting, magic and plenty of humor along the way, think Diablo meets Baldur's Gate, they have a threesome with Neverwinter Nights...you sprinkle some modern day graphics on the bed and Divinity: Original Sin is born!Sooo many quests, side missions, items and things to see...80+ hrs and we're only about half way through (respec'd a few game hours ago), combat is tactical and the animations are great!!  We've already fought goblins, trolls, skeletons, shamans, wildlife, death knights, witches and even ourselves at times...(when your tank is charmed, RUN! hah)...I can only imagine what lies ahead!?Co-op is a blast, control 1, 2 or 3 of the party members (your friend controls any you don't) and outfit / spec however you see fit, you don't have to stick together either which is very nice...my buddy can be in town selling stuff while I'm off fighting zombies or exploring etc!!The RPS (rock, paper, scissors) mini-game makes deciding wether or not we should rob the merchant we just sold a bunch of gear to much more enjoyable when your buddy can change the outcome of a conversation (disagree with you) and possibly turn that simple transaction into a battle for you life!So far it hasn't been an easy journey...we've lost some good companions along the way...but we'll make it, we will strike down every last bandit and every undead creature that stands in our way...not only to honor those who fought beside us, but to cash in on all this sweet loot we've found hah!  If you're looking for a classic, no hand holding style RPG that will probably end with you sitting alone at the computer while your wife and kids head for her sisters, PICK THIS UP...sale or not!

												This is nothing like the previous Divinity games which where action RPGs or Strategy games and pretty average to crap to be honest. Divinity Origin Sin is in the same league as Neverwinter Nights and Balders Gate. A real hard core honest to god RPG. The first real RPG in about a decade I would say and I am 30+ year gamer not some school kid. Larger publishers have been dumping our games down for about 10 years and the modern RPG now comes with the title Action RPG because its short on RPG and heavy on action. The truth is, old RPGs where heavy on action and heavy on RPG so these action RPGS are really just half a game. This game though is old school RPG, the fully crowd funded no publisher to spoil it monty.... On  metacritics users gave it 91% ands I agree with that score.... Recommended....			"

												Great game, as of now my GOTY 2014.- No handholding, no questmarkers but a comprehensive notebook.- No delivery quest, no kill 5 of these and 4 of that, but interlinked Quest that make you think and experiment (with the enviroment)- Lots of character and skillchoices. Not everything works, you have to experiment, maybe start over.- This game can be hard on normal and unforgiving on hard. Easy is actually easy but still fun and challenging.- This game has one of the best turn based combat system. Line of sight, crowd control, elemental resistances, use the enviroment for your advantage, everything makes sense.Crafting, trading and inventory management are still rough around the edges. It's working but often it's cumbersome.Update: Having finished the game I have to say the late game is a bit disappointing and it feels a bit rushed. Exploration and questing are not anymore the focus and (the still very good) combat (system) takes over, which kind of gets repetitive over time. Anyway, still a great game.			"

								I really recommend this  game as its lot of fun moving objects around as well as using them to get combat advantage. Turn based combat is really well done  and makes you think about lot of different things you can do for example using environment to your advantage or using combination of spells to do as much damage as it's possible. The game is giving player options on how to develop your character as well as if they agree  with each other on different topics. There are some problems with the game as its is early access and the game isn't perfect yet so people which want finish and well polished game should wait for the full release i also recommend to make shure your pc is powerful enough to run this game as it's not yet optimised.

												If you’re an RPG fan you will have no doubt heard of Divinity Original Sin by now, and in that regard there’s little else for me to say that many others haven’t already done so.It’s not perfect by any means, it will occasionally leave you frustrated and there are basics that it could improve upon, such as an improved quest log but don’t let that detract you from what is otherwise a fantastic game, and experience.The sheer depth of it all is staggering; from the character setup which pretty much just says “here’s a blank canvas, make who you want” and its turn based combat system, which is one of the best I’ve experienced in the genre.Simply put, Divinity Original Sin is one of the best RPGs of recent years and if you’re a fan of the genre it’s certainly a title that you should look at adding to your games library.

Posted: March 6, 2015
												I don't understand the unconditional love and hype for this game. Yes, there are definitely fun parts, but the game is riddled with bugs (some of them game-breaking), flaky behavior, and bad design choices. It feels like the first 10 hours were made with loving care and then it gets progressively more and more rushed until a the end it's nothing but fight after fight with treasure and XPs being shoveled at you so you'll hurry up and get to the end of the leveling treadmill.We experienced a game-breaking bug at the end of the game which wouldn't allow us to get into the Source Temple (the crystal that opens the door was a bugged non-object that we couldn't use and wasn't recognized by the game). I took notes during the game, here's my thoughts. As you can see, there are way more negatives than positives. Overall, I don't feel I could recommend this game.+ Great visuals. Seriously, the artwork is fantastic. A little cartoony at times, and textures are inconsistent, but the volume of eye candy more than makes up for any visual shortcomings.+ Game doesn't level-scale, meaning if you level up and come back to an area that was previously too hard, you will have an easier time of it. It really gives you a sense of gaining power.+ Has co-op! And the co-op actually works pretty well. It was so nice to be able to play this with my wife.- Some undead can be poisoned. But practically no other enemies in the game can be. I eventually stopped using poison arrows because everything was either immune to it or worse, healed from it.- When resurrected, character sometimes comes back in T-pose and stays that way until exiting (no animations, just glides around in T-pose).- Constant falling down if you're on an ice patch. Even high bodybuilding doesn't seem to help. On the contrary, enemies almost never fall down on ice.- Debug draw rays are frequently visible on characters controlled by your co-op partner when casting spells.- Running water (like creeks) isn't treated as water (doesn't make creatures in it wet, electricity and other clouds dissipate on it immediately).- Shooting a stunning cloud arrow on a wet area won't make it electrified, only a stunning arrow will work.- Enemies seem to have an incredibly high level of immunity/resistance to everything (specialty arrows like poison/charm/knockdown are pretty useless past the early levels)- Initial story is interesting (murder mystery) but quickly changes to a convoluted ""save the world because fabric of time is unravelling with demons and ice prisons and blood stones and dimensional rifts"" mess that's impossible to make sense of.- Crafting system is tedious and can mostly be skipped. It feels very tacked on. There's no crafting bench which would help with the UI and recipes. Instead, you have to find and drag things around in your inventory and whether it works or not is a baffling trial-and-error process (two small healing potions can be combined into a larger one, but two medium potions can't?). You can find books that hint on how to craft things, but unless you enjoy paperwork/memorization, you'll do like everyone else and look them up online, which means you'll spend half of your crafting time outside the game.- Enemy AI is very flaky. Enemies tend to get stuck a lot or skip their turns. It's as if they disregard viable-but-dangerous options in their behavior trees (like walking through a fire area even though they have high resistance to fire), and it leaves them in a stuck state where they do nothing and eventually pass their turn. All the while you get to sit there and wonder if you game is frozen.- Enemy AI will also sometimes be stupid and run off - probably trying to take a long convoluted path to get to you - and you have to chase them down because otherwise you're stuck in combat while they run all over the map like an idiot.- Sometimes you ""succumb to death"" without knowing what killed you. I had to look up this one area online to find out why I kept dying for no reason. A little extra explanation of what happened would help sometimes. - My enjoyment of the game was inversely proportional to the length of time I played.- Save scumming is required, and even encouraged by the game. You'll die a lot, or your game will become bugged, and you'll have to reload and replay stuff over and over until you figure out the perfect order in which to do things or how to keep your characters from stepping in the wrong spot.- Pixel-hunting for tiny switches on walls or floors is required. A lot. We had to come back to many areas we couldn't finish after looking them up online only to find there was a small hidden switch somewhere. Main quest lines should not require pixel hunting to finish. That kind of stuff is fine for side-quests or extra loot opportunities.- Too much dependency on levels. If you are two levels below your enemies (especially early on), they are nearly impossible to defeat. However, if you are one level over your enemies, they are trivial to defeat.- Smoke doesn't seem to affect enemies' line of sight. They can target you even in the thickest smoke areas - ones you can only move through because you can't target anything past your face. This has the side effect of making smokescreen arrows completely useless. I mainly noticed this after level 10 or so, it seemed like before then smokescreens would help sometimes.- My game would crash to desktop when exiting about 80% of the time.- Enemy ""idle"" animations are way too exaggerated. Elementals look like they're practically disco dancing when they're supposed to be idle. This has the side effect of making them hard to attack, since you have to click on them while they're dancing around. And if you mis-click, you get to have fun watching your character walk over to them, sucking up attacks of opportunity and walking through fire/poison along the way. You can hit ""B"" to go into an extreme top-down mode for combat targeting, but really this wouldn't be necessary if the idle animations had been toned down.- The game trains you to trust certain things and then pulls the rug out from under you at random times. For instance, there is one place that has mounds of dirt that if you dig them, explode for 32,000 points of damage, killing you and anyone around it instantly. Why do these dirt mounds explode? Who knows! Just reload and don't dig there next time.- It's extremely easy to accidentally double-click the End Turn button, which if your characters are right next to each other in initiative order will skip the following character's turn.- Maps with tons of dangerous fire areas are just annoying, because your party pathfinding AI will not avoid cutting through lava areas and getting insta-killed.- If you drink an armor potion (and probably any potion that ""casts"" a spell on you) while muted, you won't get the benefits of the potion while muted. It's as if the game treats potions as spells, which don't work while being muted.			"

												After 2 very thorough playthroughs and with 172 hours on record, I guess I must clearly recommend this game :-)It is a HUGE, wonderfully modernized but still refreshingly old-school rpg, with an incredible attention to detail, great humor, a decent story and an amazingly deep, turn-based tactical combat system that allows for countless approaches and combinations.It looks georgeous, is surprisingly bug-free for a project this size (and it's patched regularly and fast as well), and it runs well even on older systems. The crafting system is fun and intuitive, and some of the puzzles are very well done.For all the praise, however, I also have to mention the downsides. And there are definitely those:The balance, in general, could use an overhaul. The game has a pretty steep learning curve in the beginning, but once you know the system, the fights are actually very, very simple. Note that I say simple, not easy. The fights, especially boss fights, tend to be long, repetitive, tedious, and, yes, even boring. The enemies usually have a TON of hitpoints, unlimited special abilities and everyone and their mothers, - of the same level or a bit higher than the party - is pretty much immune to special abilities - and thus, most tactical choices. They do, however, do pretty pathetic amounts of damage while keeping your party stunned, crippled, knocked down, frozen and generally annoyed but alive.I would highly prefer shorter, more challenging battles against enemies that are actually affected by all the special arrows I can craft and all those abilities - foes  that are much faster to kill or disable but a lot more likely to kill ME.The numbers/RPG mechanics are yet another problem. Larian follows the old JRPG-style of insane number exaggeration. You start with a weapon that does 10 damage and you'll end with some monstrous obscentiy that can easily exceed 1000 damage on a critical hit or with a special maneuver. Enemies hitpoints and resistances grow accordingly, and the interesting enemies are thus always within about 2 levels of yours. Higher enemies are pretty much untouchable, lower ones pathetically helpless.And, finally, many quests and puzzles are just too damn obscure. I commend Larian to go against the mainstream, and skip all the quest markers, map markers, signs above a quest giver's head etc. But sometimes they fall to the other extreme and there is simply no way to continue with a quest but to randomly walk evereywhere, try everything and finally check the internet, only to learn that you missed some random item 4 hours ago... ;-PMore logic and sensible hints, please!But this is all just criticizing on a VERY high level, and it doesn't diminish the fun at all. And, hands down, you won't get a better deal for your money anywhere atm.			"

												Da good: The combat. It is tactical and fun and makes me feel smart when I beat an encounter. Lots of different ways to approach a fight.Da ok: The music. It sounds fine but instead of there being music to fit whats going on in the game there's just several music tracks that play randomly at strange times, like playing a weird 60s beach party tune while I'm fighting skeletons in a cave.Da bad: Inventory management and selling of things. I don't like games where merchant NPCs have a set amount of money. It's realistic I guess but I end up having to bounce between multiple people all over the city to sell all the junk I get and it gets tiring so I end up not picking up junk loot and now I don't have money.The entire inventory system is a mess to look at and having to move items between party members to inspect or repair is kind of a pain. There's not enough item icons either so if I wanted to find a certian chest armor in my stash I'd have to mouse over all of them because they all have the same icon.fun game though			"

												A Fantastic RPG GameDivinity: Original Sin (Classic) is a Role-Playing-Game.Just like Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, It is challenging, it has hard enemies, environmental issues to keep in mind, such as a water surface becoming electrified, or an oil pile becoming a blazing inferno and it has puzzles that are no push over, they will make your mind tick for sure.The exploration side of the game is fantastic, you have quests but it's up to you which quests you do and when you want to do them.This is a little worse than the Enhanced Edition, but not much worse the main differences are: Full voiceovers, new game modes, full controller support, split-screen co-op, hours of new and revised story content, a brand-new ending, new weapon styles, new skills and new puzzles.I highly recommend this!

												Divinity: Original Sin is a single-player and co-operative multiplayer fantasy role-playing game by Larian Studios. This game was partially funded via Kickstarter, and is a sequel to Divine Divinity (which if I'm being honest I have never heard of, or played). This game was released on 30th June 2014 for PC and Mac. I played this entire game on Steam with my husband using the co-operative multiplayer mode.The customizable protagonists of the game are known as Source Hunters. In single-player the player controls them both, while in the co-operative multiplayer each player takes control over one of them. Gameplay begins in a town called Cyseal in southern Rivellon, and the Source Hunters receive orders to investigate the murder of a town councilor. The plot goes on a journey to investigate cults, relationships, sacrifice, and more.This game ships with the editor that it was created with, and this allows players to create their own single-player and multiplayer adventures, and then publish them online.Divinity: Original Sin is a 3D, isometic, party based, turn based, choice and consequence, strategy RPG. You will need to make optimal use of action points, skills, spells, equipment, and objects within the environment to get the most out of your experience.There are 11 preset classes to choose from at the start of the game, however each can be customised to suit your own personal style of play.There are 6 attributes to select which are common throughout any RPG genre, such as strength, dexterity, intelligence, etc. There are 6 abilities to choose from which are weapons (i.e. single-handed, two-handed, etc), defence (i.e. armour specialist, shield specialist, etc.), skills (i.e. expert marksman, pyrokinetic, witchcraft, etc.), personality (i.e. bartering, leadership, etc.), craftsmanship (i.e. blacksmithing, crafting, etc.), and nasty deeds (i.e. lockpicking, etc.).There are 45 possible talents to choose from, some of which unlock as your character gets stronger and makes specific choices throughout the game. Examples of talents are gaining additional ability points, damage boosts, immunity from spells, increased spell range, etc.There are 9 different skills that you can take, and you can either have spells in each skill, or you can specialise in specific skills. Examples of skills are Expert Marksman for rangers, Man-At-Arms for melee combat, etc.My husband played as the Battlemage, and I played as a Cleric. We used supporting NPC's Madora and Jahan. I felt as though it took me a little time to really get into the combat, but our four characters complimented each other well. My husband and Jahan (specialising in Hydrosophist and Aerotheurge skills) were the casters; I was a single-handed, shield bearing tank (specialising in Man-At-Arms and Hydrosophist skills); and Madora was a two-handed damage dealing tank.Party relationships feature heavily throughout the game, for example if you damage one of the NPC's in your party whilst trying to attack an enemy they can get angry and leave the party; likewise when playing co-operative multiplayer there are specific dialogues that take place between the two 'real' players that affect their in-game relationship.The game plays out in real-time, and only the battles are turn-based and are dependent on Action Points that your character has. The number of Action Points you can use in combat is dependent on your attributes and abilities. These stats can also be affected by your gear. Combat can be influenced heavily by elements within the game, i.e. if one of your characters casts a fireball at enemies, and then poison is cast over the top of the fire, this can generate an explosion; likewise if a fireball is cast at an enemy and it then begins to rain, this can generate a steam cloud; water can be electrified by using lightning which can stun enemies (and friendly characters). All of these combinations lead to a higher level of strategy needed to finish off some of the stronger enemies that you come across.There is an entire crafting and blacksmithing element to this game, however as we were not actively role-playing throughout the game, we didn't actually find these abilities particularly useful. I had my NPC put a couple of points into crafting and blacksmithing so we could repair gear in an emergency if we were unable to teleport back to a town, but we never found any need to make potions, make our own armour, or use any food available throughout the game. Early on in the game we did use health potions a fair bit, but once all four of our characters were able to use a healing spell, they eventually became redundant too.As well as the main story in the game, there are also over 70 other side quests available. Side quests can be the best way in which to find new armour and weapons, as well as getting valuable experience to further improve your characters attributes.I did find parts of this game frustrating as the combat at times can go on forever in a big fight, you can at times get insta-killed by lava when you weren't expecting it, and we also found a few glitches here are there where we had a the game crash completely, or quests that didn't quite work as they should causing us to have to reload. Despite these issues this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game, though I would definitely recommend auto-saving on a regular basis.Having played the entire game using the co-operative multiplayer, our total play time came to just over 80hrs (each) logged on Steam. This game is most certainly excellent value for money, although I do think that we could have finished the game a little quicker than we did as we did miss some important quests early on which meant leveling up took us a bit longer than it should, but overall that was all part of the experience, and we would know better if we ever decide to do a second play through.For any fans of Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc., I urge you to get a copy of Divinity: Original Sin. It is excellent value for money, and is a great strategy RPG with a well thought out, well explained story, with excellent longevity and replayability.			"

Early Access Review
								I do recommend the game when it is all done. For the early release, buyer's beware. See laundry list of issues below (I am submitting feedback here, I cant be asked to create a larian forum account to submit feedback, sorry devs), I am not mentioning known issues or unfinished areas as they go without saying.Likes:- Controlling 2 characters with different personalities; when they argue with each other it feels schizophrenic.- The elements interacting with each other and the environment is great.- Game is stable, had no crashes. Just one lockup into a dialogue that I couldn't exit, no biggie. Things that need/will/should be fixed:- I saw an Orc attacking his shaman, I guess the latter got caught in an AoE cast by the former. It was hilarious, actually maybe this is working as intended, they are after all Orcs.- Almost all of the inhabitants have a comment when asked about that crime committed in town, ""Esme did it, she is guilty as sin"". Was fun when Esme herself had that comment.- Attacking NPCs... We murdered some 5 guards in town. No one seems to care. No witnesses, but still... somebody should react to that.- Attacking main NPCs... When approaching a certain main NPC weapons in hand confronting him... He literally disappeared in a puff of smoke. Was hoping the game would deal with it a bit better.- Balance. Seems ranged + magic is much more powerful than melee. I have won battles 3 (level 3) vs 10 (level 5+) by environment & AoE spells,  summoned creatures tanking and ranged weapons,... that is great, but my main characters actually had more talent/skill points in melee combat, going into melee was very painful not to mention degraded weapon and armour.- Need killing blow to gain XP; XP denial by allied NPC. Seems it is better to let the NPCs die or kill stealing from them, than actually fighting with them as allies.- I have characters skilled in gear repair and lock-picking,... no idea if they are not implemented or I just haven't found out how to used them or am missing an item to do it (lockpick ? Repair tool ?)- Piles of gold in inventory. So I usually get a bit of gold for every transaction with an NPC. Problem is I now have 10 piles of gold cluttering my inventory, couldn't find a way to consolidate them into a single one.- When attacking if you miss-click you can end up healing an enemy or attacking an ally. I don't mind that in principle, but maybe get a warning ""Are you sure you want to do that ?"" would be helpful. Especially since with the isometric view, it is sometimes hard to target a crab behind a character when only a wiggly leg appears behind her. The most hilarious thing was my character *shield bashing herself* instead of the crab.			"

												Over 10 years ago, I was rummaging in a bargain bin at a local Best Buy. Back then, you see we bought software in boxes and drove home with them. Backwards; i know. Nontheless, I came across an interesting box, for cheap: Divine Divinity.Divine Divinity. Like, Wet Water, or Dirty Dirt, the name was sure akward, but it was friday and was less than 5 bucks.Turns out I ended up loving that game. It remined me of Arkanum, another relatively unknown and awesome title from the era. I continued to follow this, at the time, relatively unknown game company's Divinity series. Through Divinity II, Eco Draconis and so on.These games are all, at their core, well balanced and artfulyl constructed rpg's that don't deviate far from the genre. They incorporate humor judiciously in the games, giving the game a quirky, 4th wall breaking feel from time to time. Most importantly, they are jsut quite fun, all of them.So here is the latest one. From the looks of it, a quite successful game for the company. Truthfully, there are things I preferred about previous games, butt his one certainly deserves its place in the series.Sinply put, this is a solidly crafted isometric rpg that remined me very much of the first time I played Divine Divinity. I even recognise some of the musical tracks from the first game in this game's excellent soundtrack. Very cool for an old fan!If you know how to play a game like this, it is of reasonable difficulty. Save often. If the game seems like everythign is too difficult, you're in the wrong place. I did feel like a few of the 'puzzles' were a bit too 'chancey' in their resolution. *possible spoiler* I can easily see a perfectly astute player never finding the White Witch, due to the mere trickle of information provided on what to do next (and how to do it).Despite any clunkiness, I still resommend the game. This company is, and has always been worth supporting.			"

Posted: July 13, 2014
												I can not tell you properly with words how good this game is.I will try however and I should start, as everyone, comparing it to old school RPG titles. Unlike recent RPG-called titles from this century —mostly made for the new generations of players, with little or no brains needed at all to solve quests—, Divinity: Original Sin looks like a true role playing game reminiscent of the old ages but with very cool new ideas —some of them unique— and fresh graphics.The main characteristic, typical of Larian games, is the freedom to do almost everything you want: the game is classless, so you can choose a warrior in the beginning and later on you can change your mind and provide him with some spells or range skills, if you like it, when he level up; this way you will end up with four characters, two of them from the start and two more later on, with a combination of skills, traits and talents that fits you. You can interact with almost every item in the game: doors, chests, barrels, pictures, chairs, etc, and you can open them to look inside or destroy them if you prefer, or even take them and move them from one place to another. You can also choose if you prefer to talk to every NPC and solve quests, trade with them, or killing them if you like it, or even steal their items and loot their houses. Every action will make the villagers approach you in different ways, turning hostile to you or being polite instead. And if you don't like to trade with NPCs a lot you are able to craft your own gear and even spells if you choose to do it with the immense amount of ingredients and tools you will find everywhere.What makes this game unique, and a gem, is a combination of the role playing part with the interaction between characters —even yours!— and its combat system. Divinity is not a combat focused game, it is more a conversational and exploration RPG title; however, combat is also very important and this is not a real time one, it is a turn-based combat system with action points mechanics that forces you to think about your resources, the enemies, and the environment; so each turn you can use your points to move, drink potions, attack or cast spells if you got enough points for them, or if you prefer you can reserve some of your remaining action points for your next turn, for example if you want to wait when the enemy is far away from you and later on you want to hit him two or three times in the same turn. The best part of the system is, no doubt, the chance —and mostly the need— of using the elements on your favour. It means you can cast a rain spell on your characters to stop them from burning; you can also cast rain on enemies, make them wet and then cast electricity spells for extra damage and stuns. You can also use ice spells if enemies are wet —state than come from your spells or from real rain itself!— to freeze them. You can shoot (after throwing it for example) an oil barrel with a fire spell to make it explode and damage the area, or just hit it with your arrows to make it pour the oil and later on cast fire on it if you wish. You can make an ice barrier to protect, wait until enemies are near it and then fire it, making it water and causing enemies to stumble, and then electrify them. You can combine elements to create clouds to avoid being a target. You can stealth and stab enemies too if you have the right character to do such a thing. You can use barrels and things of the environment to take cover, to protect you and to avoid damage. You can also try to flee if you find the situation too chaotic for your taste. You can... well, you can —and you should— do all these things if you want to survive, because combat is not always an easy task on this game. For all these things I must say this is a heck of a game; I have not THAT fun with a videogame probably since some decades (I'm absolutely for real here). It's also true that there are some things that are not optimal and need improvement. Among the negatives, there is the camera movement, the slow pace of the game sometimes when you need to go from A to B, and the bad interfaz mechanics when you need to equip gear, change items from character to character, sell something or look at the items you got, or pick them. This is not a noob-friendly game; aside from the little dungeon tutorial at the start, you will find little or no help at all and you will find lost yourself if you are not used to RPGs games. However, asking in the forums will help you; there will be trolls, true, but overall the community will end up answering your questions and solving some of your starting problems, I'm pretty sure.But if I take all these things together and put them all in a balance, I have to recommend this game to every player in the world. If you are an oldschool gamer you just can't pass on this. And if you are a new player and you didn't play or didn't even know any of the games other guys are mention, you have to give this one a chance and compare it yourself with the new RPGs. I promise you won't be disappointed.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin - A game with great combat, great dialog, and irritating crafting system.I'll Try and keep this short and to the point as I'm not the greatest at writing reviews in the first place. I just finished the game last night after putting approx 215 total hours into playing it solo. I play taking my time and searching for secrets and sidequests and reading all the text for all Npcs. So my view of the game might differ from someone who likes to get through games faster, only worrying about major quests. Overview of the plot: The two main characters you start with are source hunters which are sent out to investigate the murder of a town councilor. You quickly discover there is much more going on and uncover a massive plot. Along the way you find a few characters which you can bring into your party to help. You can have 4 party members total not counting temporary summons. Each party member has there own story and motivations for joining which you eventually can learn more about. You eventually learn more about yourselves and your role in the past that is gradually reveled to you as you progress through the game. PROS:Combat is fun and doesn't get to repetitive. There are many different skills you can learn and characters are not tied to one ""class"". Elements can be used together to achieve various results in combat along with environmental effects. Fire and poison create explosions, water or blood on the ground can be frozen to make enemies fall, water on the ground can be electrified to stun anything standing in it, etc. There are many possibilities with combat that helps keep fights fresh. There are hidden side quests and loot that gives a reason to explore.The dialog and writing are great, there are some interesting and witty moments that make you smile. The areas and environments look great.Some quests have multiple choices and outcomes. Its nice to have choices and different ways to complete a quest.Turn based combat that lets you use tactics and strategy. Co-op support. Although I didn't like playing it co-op so I played solo I'm sure there are plenty that would rather play with a friend. I like that it gives you a choice and you can play solo or co-op without the game giving an advantage to one over the other.CONS:The crafting system is frustrating and you will find yourself never using it. Good luck figuring out what can be crafted or even how to craft anything without looking it up online. Yah there are a few recipe books you can find in the world but there only cover a tiny fraction of crafting and they are usually cryptic and don't help much. If you want to figure out any other recipes on your own without looking them up on the internet be prepared to just keep dragging random items on top of each other for hours in your inventory randomly hoping something happens... I like games that don't hold your hand sometimes and make you figure things out but this crafting system is not a good example of that at all. Its just a bad design for a crafting system. there isn't enough reason to spend gold. Its easy to amass a hoard of gold by mid game but there really isn't much to use it on. Its fairly easy to get gold selling junk you find and paintings or gold forks you find around. I ended the game with almost 200k just on one character alone. At the end of the game I was still using level 10 ish boots and shoulders on my mage. Finding mage gear other than just the robe was almost impossible. Maybe that was just my luck but I think the balance of gear dropped for each class should be looked at "

												You will like this even if you aren't a CRPG fan due to its co-op nature. If you're an old school RPG player, however, you'll immediately be drawn back into your childhood--of the times spent discovering Fallout 2's world and Baldur's Gate. Even if you spent time with the Final Fantasy series and other JRPGs, you'll still be reminded heavily of the past. Both western and Japanese RPGs are genres that suffered as we moved into millennium. They lost their purpose and games evolved, leaving them behind. It takes games like Divinity: Original Sin to remind us of what a RPG really is. Its combat is old school and turn-based, its loot similarly complex, and its storyline muddied and epic in every sense of the word. It plays like a 1990's game through and through, of a RPG that has entirely too much crammed into its tiny world.Except, well, this world isn't so tiny. In a modern age, the designers can fit as much as they want. In result, they've managed to make a modern CRPG while keeping the vintage feeling. Cyseal is stuffed full of side quests, treasure, friends, and foes. It feels almost alive, bustling with NPCs and activities to do. Every barrel has an ingredient for something you don't know how to make just yet, every area has a few NPCs you don't know their purpose of, and it's easy to get lost. But you won't mind it that much. A graveyard has a secret tunnel that takes you to a few chests and some enemies; cellars can have great riches or just cobwebs; and you can explore so many areas in so many ways.At the end of the day, it's an experience and it's mostly an amazing one. I truly recommend it. There are frustrating moments, confusing game design choices, a few annoying bugs, and, as with every CRPG, the game is unfriendly to new players. But it's not unfriendly without a purpose. It's unfriendly to try to inspire nostalgia which it successfully does, paying homage to an entire decade of gaming. For an indie studio to accomplish this via Kickstarter and to accomplish it so well is nothing short of a miracle.Now please excuse me. If you'll need me, I'll be off sneaking somewhere--probably opening a few chests and stealing a few paintings from the inn.  It's nothing personal, dear mayor. I just rolled a character who was heartless.			"

												Easily my GOTY so far for 2014. Divinity: Original Sin is a great throwback to old school RPG’s, with some great and varied questing (be prepared for lots of reading!) lots of loot, talent trees, magic/skills, etc. I found the visuals very appealing, with lots of colour and great artistry. The music is top notch and fits the game perfectly. The combat (turn-based) is just heaps of fun, with all the different spells and skills available to use. The strategic combos of elemental magic never gets old.In the end I played almost 90 hours and didn’t encounter a single bug or glitch, which is quite a feat considering the scope of this game. All in all this is a must play for all fans of meaty turn-based RPG’s.  Can’t recommend it enough. "

The combat is fresh and very akin to Temple of Elemental Evil... which is AWESOME. This game is a no brainer must buy if you are a true hardcore old school RPG fan.You can check out my fully voice acted Lets Play on YOUTUBE.

												Finally.It feels like forever that a game of this scope, of the quality has gracedthe gaming industry. Many turn to Dragon Age are the defacto ""king"",but that is a choice made from a lack of competition. To say that Divinity:Original Sin is satisfying, is to say ""ice is cold"". You just know it as fact.Even those early playthroughs where you just mess up badly, but youdiscover some hidden scene that would not otherwise have been seen.There is a caveat, though. This isn't a console style 5 hour tutorial-stylegame. While you aren't thrown into death itself like Dark Souls, you arenot told what to do, and how to do it every second. It respects the factyou have a memory and some intellect and that we enjoy challenge. The graphics are quite lush, despite not being a graphics-focused game,you won't ever find yourself being unimpressed or let down. It reallydoes feel and come across as a work of passion, of love. The devs hadput much of themselves into this game. If you are a fan of RPGs, or of Larian, you owe it to yourself to play thisgame. Not since Ultima 7 has a game really captured that feel of a reallyinteractive world. Oh, and do yourself a favour, choose the Pet Pal talenton your first playthrough (because there will be more, trust me).			"

Early Access Review
								I played this a lot more than Steam thinks I have - probably 12-15 hours or so in bits over the course of it since Alpha.This game is fantastic. It's everything you have ever wanted a multiplayer RPG to be. The conversation options and the asymmetrical dialog (Players each have independent dialog options) make for a really engaging experience where you truly feel like you're roleplaying in a way reminiscent of games from awhile back. I'd say they don't make them like they used to, but Larian's proved that wrong with Divinity: Original Sin.There's a lot of customization available, and while the game in screenshots resembles Diablo or Torchlight with their 3d Isometric views, this is not a hack and slash game - enemy encounters pause the action and pop up action bars, with movement and action point costs. Combat is turn-based, and it feels and plays and looks fantastic.This game is labelled as early access but it is indeed basically done. I've been following the production since Kickstarter, and the actual Launch day is in a couple days at the end of June. If you're looking for a great RPG to play with someone else, with lots of engaging gameplay and the ability to create watercooler moments (few things are as  fun as when you both have different ideas for how you should act/treat an NPC and you just do your own thing), look no further.Also a full suite of modding/content creation tools, so if you don't like the game you were given, use the engine to make your own RPG.If Steam doesn't sell this game in a 2-pack, they really should.

												Gameplay-wise, this might very well be my favorite RPG ever.No worst-of-both-worlds, real-time-with-pause nonsense here. No samey filler battles, either. Each battle is a tough, interesting tactical challenge that can be dealt with in a variety of ways, depending on how you customized your characters. Character customization is great too: the ""classes"" are just suggested default builds, you can ignore them and just mix and match the available skills however you want.The story is... entertaining. Nothing special, but the dialogue is lively and quirky and creates a fun atmosphere. It doesn't try to be more than what it is, which is a pretty big plus. Still, this is definitely a ""gameplay"" RPG rather than a ""story"" RPG. The fact that you control two characters and can roleplay the interactions between them does a lot to keep cutscenes and choices interesting, though.If you're in the mood for a few interesting, tactical battles in a fun fantasy land, you can't do much better than this game.

												I didn't play any of the classic RPGs like Baldur Gates, but when this game came out it promised so many things that I miss from modern RPGs (yes I know, hipster). It expanded on things I love, like turn based and tactical combat, lots of dialogue and freedom to interact with the world in several ways. I loved that questlines could be solved in different ways, including ""cheesing"" it. For me, that makes it feel more believable. In real life, you don't have a set ways of dealing with things, you improvise. I finally finished the game on PS4, because that's more my thing, and I was impressed how well the controls translated.			"

												This is a Gem! A tactical turned based Rpg with tons of spells and skills. The fights r amazing as hard too, u can play with the elements found on screen like use a lightning bold on a surface of water it will cause the creature standing on it to be stuned. Has a lot of that to discover + rich story with very cool ending. Side quests r many and a challenge as well cause some of them require puzzle solving, reading books and have a keep eye to spot clues. Game is HUGE took me a while I totaly recommend it. It can be slow paced so if u looking for an action style rpg this isnt it, otherwise u will love it :)			"

												By far and above the best co-op rpg I have played. My other half and I often sit down in the evening and play an hour or two of this after dinner and its a great way to spend time together. It is so easy to set up a network and play either in the same house or when we happen to be miles apart, with skype running in the background it's a great way to hang out across the distances. Characters are well developed, story is excellently well written and not predictable. The humor is fantastic, and there are so many little touches that add something special to the game. It's really very beautiful as well. Highly recommended as a single player campaign but it really shines as two player co-op.			"

												Buy this game.  Don't ask questions, don't waste time reading reviews or comments, just buy this game right now.If you are an individual who enjoyed the classic Baldur's Gate games, Fallout 1&2, or any other games in the same vein, you will love this game, I give you my 100% guarantee.My buddy and I started this game Co-op, deciding that we should each build our character without discussing it with the other, and just hope it worked out.  I made a spellsword who can talk to animals, hit things with a sword, and cast an arguably wise selection of spells.  He made a character with no combat skills whatsoever, opting for a character who can talk his way into places and out of trouble, pick locks, sneak around, and steal everything that isn't bolted down using telekinesis.After we somehow survived the first few combat encounters and made it to the first town, we promptly ended up raking in thousands of gold and numerous useful magic items in what could best be described as an ""ownership transferral spree.""So, 4ish hours into the game we've done practically nothing to advance the story, we have way more money and way better items than we're sure we're supposed to by now, and we've had more fun than we have had in most games we've ever played together.Buy this game!

												Divinity: Original Sin is one of the best games I've played in a long, long time. It strikes a very good balance between old school cRPG and modern design. It has plenty of text, quests, exploration, and discovery while including many of the usability improvements we've come to expect these days.The combat system is probably the best I've ever played in a game like this. I've been on the fence of the Turn Based vs Real Time with Pause argument but this game makes a hell of a case for turn based gameplay. The elemental combinations and environmental interactions are exceptionally executed and allow for tactics I've never experienced in a game before.As of this review I'm at 82 hours played on my second playthrough and still enjoy it tremendously. I absolutely cannot wait to see what mods we'll get for it.It's not perfect (which game is?) but it's damn good. At the rate they've been updating the game (every few days) I expect Divinity: Original Sin to settle in nicely with the greats of the cRPG genre.But, it's not for everyone. While the moment to moment writing is generally excellent the whimsical tone may turn people off and the overall plot rather bland. I've seen complaints from people accustomed to modern game handholding - it's true the game does not slap down objective markers and tell you where to go at all times. You need to talk to NPCs and pay attention to quest details. If you love exploring and the reward you get from discovery then you owe it to yourself to check out Divinity: Original Sin. "

												that one is hard. this game was cool at first but turned out the complete opposite near the ending. the character creation is nice and flexible, and you actually can make real multi-class from any class (and there is the one with the perk of talking to animals!). the quests and dialogues are cute in good old classic rpg style. the fights are hard enough to be entertaining but not impossible, the fighting system is interesting, i especially liked that you can combine different areas of effects to create even more effects!so, those traits were bright and noticable, in the beginning this punch you in the face and make you enjoy every second of game. but after some time this feeling faded and let you see a lot of issues. first of all, there are thons of bugs. i played with my friend, and i must admit, the coop is made not as well as we dreamed it would be. my friend was hosting me, so she had all the saves. the game kept sending her messages that 'the space in the cloud is almost over'  despite the fact that we had a few saves, and all the loadings were really long despite my friend's laptop is good enough to run the witcher 3. we  struggled with a lot of problems with connection, even when we played sitting at the same couch. there was a mindblowing bug when you just had loaded your save and than found out that your character's stats were dropped to the values you had at level one, and now your high-level equipment doesn't fit you anymore, and you need to reload to fix this. the locations in the middle and the end of the game are big and boring. most fights became boring after level 10 or so. and the further you go in the game there more it is clear that all the story is about the lamest love triangle. most quests near the ending are long and contain frustrating puzzles my least favourite type: to solve those you need to push buttons in the order you have no clue about. the worse was the one where you need not just push the buttons, but put a very specific burden on them. that one made us miserable.the ending is confusing and felt rushed. the final battle lefts you with the  'and that's it?!' feeling. but i must admit, i have a suspicion that the huge part of all those issues were fixed in enchansed edition. the only problem is: enchansed edition needs much more powerful hardware than mine, so i didn’t have a chance to test it. i know that this game was fully sponsored by kickstarter donations, and i think that developers tried their best. i also heared that the second part is much, much better than the first, and i think, i might gave it second chance as soon as i'll get a new laptop. so i'll go with 'recomend'. i still have some expectations and there is no option to write the neutral review here on steam.

												DivOS is a solid, fun, and often funny CRPG with some pretty unique mechanics for environmental interaction that will greatly change how you approach combat in almost every encounter. It takes some unique twists on standard fantasy storytelling, and has a very relaxing ""stop and smell the roses"" pacing that nonetheless drives its story forward without derailing too often.The graphics, while fairly humble in fidelity, are vibrant, clear, and lovingly crafted, with each environment displaying personal effort in making them look believable. This is doubly valuable in combat, where areas of danger (or benefit, depending), are easily defined and the positioning of enemies is likewise.Playing with a friend in co-op is a blast, allowing both your PCs equal purchase in conversation, and even the ability to disagree or argue with your friend. Outside of fully leaving the current map, which requires you to gather your party before venturing forth, you don't even have to always be together which creates some fun moments of parallel travel and risk to complete objectives simultaneously.DivOS' weaknesses are mostly technical and balance related. Technically, there are just some polish and functionality weaknesses in the product; personally the volume sliders were always binary for me. 1-100 was ""on"" and 0 was ""off,"" meaning my voice chat with my friend was often fighting for audio supremacy, something that would often balloon into a bigger problem with certain NPCs whose audio-leveling-out was wildly inconsistent, either shattering my ears or being imperceptible. On top of this most of the voicework is ugly or weird; it's clear there was a reach for comedy here, but it's way off the mark--the writing is better by far in this case.Balance-wise, the game is all over the map. My personal experience, with a melee-heavy party (two two-handed weapon users, both focused on Man-at-Arms skills), my friend attempting a rogue, and a single wizard, was that melee is incredibly bad in the beginning of the game. Hit chance is very, very low, leading to lots of big wiffs and encounters that SHOULD be simple becoming complex and difficult. While this slowly improved, it took a lot of investment in skills and gear to do so, and even then my character was still inconsistent. Similarly, my friend's Rogue was wholesale useless, and he took a turn into making his character into a support mage, which was what helped propel our party forward.On the other end of the spectrum, magic-users are incredibly powerful. Some exceedingly good spells that can deal big damage AND stun/root/control enemies have a one-turn cooldown, meaning our wizard character could dominate the battlefield with damage and status effects every time his turn came around. This NPC became the linchpin of our party, creating openings for the rest of us to deal damage.So, is it worth it with these issues? What's the good news? All of the above weaknesses were fixed with the Enhanced Edition, which rebalanced combat (especially in the early game) to be less punishing for melee players, gave Wizards better weapons (wands), but fairer cooldowns, and fixed all the technical oddities like the audio bugs. On top of this, they polished the visuals up and, near as I can tell, re-recorded ALL of the voice work for the game to remove the more grating VO and give many NPCs full voice-acting. Even better: if you own THIS version, you can get the Enhanced Edition for free, and it is ABSOLUTELY worth your time, even if only to see the work Larian put into this re-freshing of an already solid game.This is an excellent game, and almost more importantly, Larian Studios is an excellent developer. Few companies would be willing to spend the time to improve an already-released title wholesale, even fewer would be willing to give it to you for free. Support developers like this, let the gaming world know this kind of players-first behaviour should be rewarded!			"

												This game is hands down the best turn based isometric RPG to come out since the late 90s- early 2000s. Its mindblowing. It is everything a true RPG fan could want, depth, story, tactics, customization. So many modern RPGs are dumbed down, basically a siries of ""go here, do this"" fetch, kill the whatzit, ect quests with little minimap icons to point you along the way. Not Divinity: Original Sin.  Its challenging. It makes you think, use tactics and your environment in combat, and also to get hidden bits of story. If you just wade in to battle, expect to get pulverized. Its for the die hard RPG fan. Casual players or people who expect to always win and not talk to people and go places just for more plot are not going to like this. People who want a modern take on the great RPGs of the late 90s are going to think their dreams came true with this one.I know I did.As far as the co-op goes, its a cool feature and I suppose some people like it, but I could have totally done without it. Really. RPGs are single player in my world. Fortunately, you can choose a ""personality"" for the char youre not playing, or just pick the dialogue yourself. If your chars disagree a ""rock paper scissors"" type game insues, where you get bonuses based on the type of answer you made (if you have a high skill in a type of answer, you get more points) and the winner of that is the one who makes the final choice. Its interesting to say the least.			"

												I can't quite express just how much I love this game.If you love RPGS, and I mean, like actual RPGS, with in depth story, character development, concequence, and problem solving elements then you will enjoy Divinity.One thing I will say, is don't play this game expecting an easy ride. Don't expect quest markers to point out where you need to go, you actually need to read stuff, refer to your journal, and figure it out yourself. Don't expect to be able to blast through the game like you can with a lot of mordern games, D:OS will make you take your time and slap you in the face if you try to go where you shouldn't.The combat is great, it's really tactical. I've found myself having to tap into tabletop RPG ways of thinking, and also having to devise tactics to beat groups of enemies. It's effing great, especially if you play with someone. I'm not sure if it's less enjoyable as a solo experience as I have only played Co-op, but I would certainly reccomend playing with someone yes, it adds an extra layer to the game.10/10, seriously looking forward to the sequel.Thanks for this awesome game.

												Old-school RPG made like it should be. Tactical turn based combat that works great, massive amounts of lore and dialogue to roam through, interesting characters. Art, environmental effects and spell effects, all look fantastic. Co-op gives a nice change for the genre.Recommend for every RPG fan out there. Can't wait for the second game.Pros:- Co-op.- Graphics are beautiful.- Challenging.- Lots of content. Diversity of quest.- No actual class system (might be a con for some people).- Humor, character interactions/banter.Cons:- Little voice acting.- I wasn't fan of the idea of rock-paper-scissors minigame making the decision for me.- Crafting could have been better.- Might be a bit too challenging if you are new to micromanaging RPG games or if you don't actually read the info given to you.- Way too little ingame information about stats/skills/game play mechanics.If you own the original game you'll get the Enhanced Edition free in a bit.

												This game is Great. Best RPG i played this year with Wasteland 2 (waiting for the witcher 3).Nowadays its rare when you need 80 hours to finish a RPG and im glad to see those 2 games showing us what it was to play a rpg like baldur's gates back in the days. The sound track is awsome, the dialogs are goods. This game has probably one of the best turn by turn combat system i ever saw in a video game.Hes not flawless though. The thiefs skills are bads, like very bad. You disarm like 99% of the traps by shooting them because the tools are expensives, and single-use. Anyway there are only mines, nothing more. If you want to open a locked chest its ten time easier to bash his face with an unbreakable weapon than using again an expensive and single-use tool. The stealth is in my opinion useless in combat, invisibility skill (every rogue can have it at level 1 if i remenber well) does the job though so the rogue is still very powerfull in combat).But these problems doesnt change the fact this game is a must have for everyone loving  RPGs			"

												Divinity: Original Sin succeeds wholeheartedly in establishing a classic RPG without feeling old. Although it can be rough around the edges, it is easily recommendable to any RPG fan. Original Sin is a game that gives you a lot of room and allows you to solve its odd encounters in numerous creative ways. Every new area has the potential of putting you in yet another highly amusing event and wandering around the colorful world of Rivellon is certain to be entertaining. There are definitely a lot of tiny annoyances (co-op dialogue is clunky, the game poorly hints at which direction you should go, the main story isn't immensely interesting and more companions would be great) but these are all just tiny issues in what is otherwise a fantastic RPG that allows you to interact with a highly engaging world in creative and clever ways. Excellent turn-based combat that highly promotes clever solutions and party interaction, a highly amusing and meticulously filled world and a great sense of player freedom make this one of the best RPGs in a long time.

Posted: August 2, 2015
												Overall, this is a decent game, especially for one that was funded by Kickstarter and did not have the mega-budgets of some of the larger RPGs from companies like Bioware.  I find it generally fun, but there are a lot of issues with the game surrounding lack of information given to the player either int he manual or during game play about how the game actually works.Pros -+ Free-form character development: there are no classes so you can design a character however you want. But this can also be a con, see below.+ Immersive world with an interesting backstory and good motivations for your characters+ Ability to RP the characters in the actual game, not just in local chat, by using conversation options even among your own part members.+ Complete control over the NPCs - there is no need to live with idiot AI to charge stupidly into battle and cause a team wipe. You also control what skills and abilities they take as they level up.+ Graphics and sound are good+ Open world that lets you do just about anything within reason.  You won't see a lot of 'you can't do that' messages from the game, which is nice.Cons - - Lack of *useful* information for the player detracts from the freeform character design. For example, I had to discover online that higher skill ranks cost more to purchase, and would not simply unlock as level went up. There is no indiation of this anywhere in game nor in the game manual. The manual is also very vauge on things like how points you will have to invest, what the max level is, etc. You can easily nerf your own character due to this lack of information.- Prices at the vendors are psychotically insane given what you find while adventuring.  The only way to stay 'on par' (with what the game seems to expect you to have) is to steal everyone blind and sell them back their own stuff. This utterly wrecks immersion unless you have a party full of kleptos.  Not to mention stealing is stupidly easy to do and not get caught, so the claim in the game manual, that stealing leads to a rep hit, is patently false unless you're dumb enough to steal right in front of the NPCs.- Way too many quests make their way into your journal before you can finish even one that you are working on, so this game is like Skyrim in that it suffers from massive quest spam. Also, several quests are really about the same thing, which just clutters up the journal.- Speaking of quests, many of the quest entries are utterly useless because they are too vauge, things like 'You noticed something interesting about the door in Jon's house.' Oh THAT is going to help me next week when I get back to investigating this quest.- In what appears to be a misguided effort to make the game seem hardcore, without actually being hardcore, it is way too easy to die and way to easy to rez in this game. Death is meaningless if you can just resurrect people.  - The economy is completely broken. This is related to the stealing.  You have to steal people blind because you need money, but stealing them blind gives you more than you need, so you are walking around swishing huge bags of gold by level 4. The designers clearly realized this so they made things expensive and forced you to die and buy res scrolls (see above) to help drain some gold. Which they only needed to do because they made stealing so profitable in the first place.  On the whole I think the flaws are serious but not game-breaking.  I am giving this game a very weak thumbs-up. I don't regret buying it, and I am having fun playing with a friend co-op because I have not been able to play a paper RPG with him for many years and this lets us relive the good-old days. But I have to admit if this game were solo, I'd probably have stopped playing it after a few hours because of all the issues, especially the broken economy.			"

												A fantastic game to play with a friend, this game starts off a bit slow and difficult but quickly becomes extremely interesting and provides many hours of enjoyable gameplay. The turn based combat system can be quite deep, allowing you to make use of a variety of combos to lock down or blow up your enemies (e.g. a pool of oil may be cast, slowing enemies, and followed up with a fire based spell igniting the ol and everyone within while the smoke blinds them). There is also far more to this game than just combat: you can sneak around town stealing, use an extensive crafting system to get better equipment and make many changes to the story you experience through converstation.I have played through the game once and plan to do so again.

												If you're a fan of Infinity era RPGs, the only reason you still haven't bought DOS is that you're afraid of yet another Larian child having come to life with three arms and one leg. After 12 hours, I have to conclude that, surprisingly, it seems to have the correct amount of parts in the right places. The graphics are pretty, UI is practical, gameplay is smooth and the story is coherent (at least so far). Despite that, nowadays even a good single player game where you have to spent hours just going around talking to NPCs and get excited over it is usually not enough to deter most people from playing their Counter Strikes, Dotas or what have you instead. Luckily, unless the developers consider split personality disorder fun, the game is intended to be played in co-op, which dramatically changes the experience for the better, although it takes time getting used to reading the dialogues in the chat log or having your friend retell them to you. There are a few other flaws like: long loading times, weird choice of music for some encounters, not enough ways to customize the look of your character, stealing and breaking in almost always goes unpunished unless you're doing it in plain sight etc. It's really not that big of a deal, especially  considering that the game supports modding and the developers are actively patching it as well. If you have a good friend willing to spend his precious time exploring the intricacies of Rivellon with you, I'd strongly recommend buying it. If you're a lonely nerd longing for a proper RPG game, pick it up and you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, keep playing Dota.			"

												All right, I'll stop playing the game long enough to write a review!  So please be grateful, because I could be playing my game instead ;)  This game is the best computer RPG I've ever played--PERIOD.  I prefer RPG's where you have a small party of adventurers rather than a lone wolf, and this game even offers the ability to play co-operatively with a friend!  The turn based combat is so addictive that it makes me wish there was some type of battle arena in the game, where you could just send your party to go fight groups of monsters or mages in various environments.  This is not to say the game is perfect, because there is the small matter of some puzzles in the game being ridiculously difficult, and I just don't see the need for that.  In most cases, there is a hint or clue that you can find and it'll help you solve the puzzle, but there are a few cases where the only way to solve it is to try dozens of combinations and waste your precious gaming time (possibly getting annoyed in the process), or you have to leave your game and hop on a search engine to locate the tips you need to solve the puzzle.  I feel these puzzles actually detract from the overall experience of the game, because after a couple of frustrating puzzles, I have an almost knee-jerk reaction to all puzzles in the game--that is to say that if I don't figure out a puzzle within a minute, I am tempted to save myself a lot of time and aggravation by just returning to the handy game guide I found on the internet.  A game shouldn't send the player running away to use a search engine--it should keep the player happily engaged in the game.  Of course, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who enjoy puzzles, but I'm not one of them, and if i was, I'd probably buy a puzzle game instead of a role playing game.  So my advice on puzzles is to try them but cheat the moment you feel frustrated, because the rest of the game is a lot of fun and you shouldn't waste time on the worst part of the game ;)  (Too bad no one advised the developers not to waste time on those puzzles...)Ignoring that one drawback, you are likely to fall in love with this game.  The environments are gorgeous and maps are very well designed, the soundtrack is amazing and really pulls you deeper into the experience.  The quests and adventures in this game are likely to entertain you, and you'll have many opportunities for actual role playing in this game, which is something missing from pretty much every other RPG I've ever played on a computer.  In this game, you get to choose dialogue between the characters, which effects their attitude toward each other and shapes their relationships throughout the game.  I'm sure every playthrough will feel quite different because of the characters you make and how you choose to play them.  One final thing I wanted to mention is that crafting and blacksmithing are more fun in this game than any other game I've played in this genre.  I always enjoy collecting ingredients and combining them to make awesome gear (that is often better than items you can purchase from vendors).  In other games, alchemy and crafting were side activities that rarely ever resulted in something more useful than a healing potion, but in Divinity: Original Sin it's fun and rewarding just discovering new recipes and experimenting with your ingredients.I absolutely recommend this game to everyone who is a fan of role playing games and turn based combat.  It's definitely one of my favourite computer games in my entire collection!			"

												Incredible game! When I first started following this game, I was put off by the amount of dialog that seemed to be present.That is not an issue.The dialog, while verbose, is broken up into easily read portions. Conversations are handled in logical ways. I have yet to run across any dialog that I wanted to ""skip through"". All of the dialog has added something to my experience, just as it should in a quality RPG.The shear amount of things to do is incredible. I usually play my RPGs as a “good” guy; You know the type. I won’t steal, trespass, or try to break the game’s progress. Divinity WANTS you to do those things! Once I let go of my lawful tendencies, the game opened up on a whole new level.Sneak into a house and rob in blind? Check.Bust open a shop door? Check.Murder an NPC for her possessions? Check.Dig up a grave or three for lofty loot? Check.In fact, had I not done at least a bit of this the game would have been much harder so far. This speaks truths to some aspects of real life experience as well. Not that I have ever done anything like that listed of course, but its possible out here, and possible in Divinity too.Then there is the lovely, turn based, tactical combat. Personally, I haven’t seen enough combat! This system is enjoyable enough that I think it could be a game unto itself. Rain on a fire based enemy, zap it with a water based spell, and cause massive bonus damage, just as logic would dictate. Fire and lava on the map will actually heal those fire-based dudes, too. Nothing feels quite so bad as when that badass sword swinging melee fighter runs off, steps in lava, and heals for 3000 points (When he only has 150 HP to begin with!). Knowing you have to kill this thing in one turn so it can’t heal really puts the pressure on.Opposite to that, catch on oil slick on fire. The fire will spread all over and enemies enveloped by it act accordingly, sometimes casting rain spells of their own to counter. Of course, casting rain now makes then wet, and they can be more easily frozen. I love this system, and many combinations exist. Poison arrow bombs. Electricity streaming through a newly created rain puddle. Teleport that bad dude into a lava flow for virtually instant death. SO MANY OPTIONS!Exploration. The game is HUGE! I have about 25 hours in and have not completed the first area yet (I am told 100 hours for a first playthrough is not unreasonable). I am only at level 6 with my characters, too. I have found a way to “skip” past a lot of the content in the first area, but the next map harbors enemies that start at level 9. So, while possible, it’s not advised. The game does not put up an artificial barrier to block your progress (Or hasn’t so far). In the first town I was warned by the city guards that I was not strong enough but they would still open the gates for me, leaving the choice up to me.The game will require some thinking outside of the box. Some of the boss fights you will face can be brutally hard. But with the proper application of strategy and using the tools at your disposal, all fights seem fair. Nowhere did I feel I had been cheated, either in battle or in the puzzles. And if you do feel so, the quick save and quick load function can be used anywhere.So, tl;dr? If you even remotely liked Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, this game will scratch that same itch. "

Early Access Review
								Having put over eighty hours into the game it'd be pretty hard not to recommend at this point. I had been looking into buying it since it became available on Early Access, but held off. After it went into beta, I honestly couldn't help myself. It looked way too good to ignore any longer and glitches and frustrations would have to be taken in stride. I needed a role playing game with only customizable characters. I got that and the ability to give my characters a personality. It really is an enjoyable game, even in the beta form.     The game sports a delightfully colorful cartoonish look while maintaining a fair grip on reality. The colors themselves feel sort of like pastels. Overall, the style of it looks wonderful in motion. Every area also in the game feels unique enough to where you'll be able to comfortably play without relying on the map. Even the darker areas of the game such as burning forests and dripping coves feel consistent with the rest of the game's appearance. Character models kind of look like clay, but don't look terrible because of it. Instead, they blend rather well with the world. Spells are flashy and when they hit, they make a noticeable impact. Animations all feel smooth. Each spell class (Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Witchcraft) all have a similar base, but different overall presentation.     The combat is turn based, but flows fairly fast. Attacks don't take a lot of time to execute and given the tactical nature of skills, battles can end in an instant. Some of the more drawn out battles come from larger groups of enemies, rather than smaller groups of tougher combatants. A lot of effort was noticeably put into enemy placement. This was done to make each battle not only feel unique, but keep players on their toes. There are conveniently placed barrels of oil and water throughout the world and using them to your advantage is nearly vital to survival. Elements play a major role in combat as things like electrified water can stun enemies and iced ground can cause a player to slip. Their effects can be null if your character rolls a high enough saving throw based on your stats. You can also remove hazards from the field through the same use of elements. Fire will melt ice and explode poisonous clouds, while water from rain will douse fires.      The number of actions you can take during a turn in battle depends on how many actions points your character has. Everything from casting spells to equipping items and simply moving consumes action points. This ensures that the player thinks about every choice they make for everything that they do. The enemy AI isn't too stupid to walk directly into a fire pit and will generally go after squishier party members before others. They also incorporate tactics of their own will use the environment to their advantage as well if they are able. Unfortunately, melee enemies have a tendency to mob from time to time which makes dispatching them a little easier than normal. Leveling can be a bit of a pain, but isn't too tiresome. Grinding, however, is out since enemies do not respawn as there are a set number of them in the game. There are two side notes I would like to make about the game's difficulty. One, the game does have a difficulty setting that I haven't used myself yet. And two, I'm basing this analysis on multiple play-throughs with only a party of two. There are two companions available in the current build of the game a mage and warrior and there will likely be more when the game releases officially.      What skills a character can learn are based on the number of points put into that particular school. There are eight different classes to choose from. They are simply warrior, air, water fire, earth, witchcraft, ranger and rogue. The first level in a class allows for you to learn three skills in that class and from there it gradually increases with each until you get to level five where you can learn an unlimited number of for that particular class. There are no limits as to what combinations you make with these classes. However, there is a level limit attached to skills as well which makes it that much harder to strike a balance with more specific role playing characters you make. It should also be noted that physical based characters feel really underpowered compared to mages.     The character creater comes with eleven pre-made classes. They all range from your standard to pre-built hybrid classes. What weapons you start with are based on the class you choose before further editing it. So if you want to make a warrior-mage that starts with armor and a sword, you would first have to choose either the knight or fighter class, then edit the skills to liking from there. Cosmetically speaking, the game offers up numerous customization options that allow to make your character your own. There are a dozen different skin tones, hair styles, and faces available. Everything seems well made and a finished character actually looks like it belongs in the game it came from unlike some character creator results.     The story, or what little of it that has been made available in the beta, feels straight forward, tight and fun. The story follows your two created characters traveling to the town of Cyseal to investigate a murder. You are to find evidence of Sourcery and eliminate it with extreme prejudice. Or you could just meander about and until the actual plot comes in. The reason for your characters journey is just a means to an end. What becomes increasingly clear as you move forward with the game's plot is that your characters much more than the mere mortals that they start off to be and they'll learn as much about their past selves as you do as the game moves forward. Your characters can grow to love are hate each other based on the personalities that you give them. Things can even entirely platonic between your characters if that is what you want.     The way this works is that there are instances where your characters can communicate with one another and from there, you can choose their responses to one another. These events can be triggered by any number of things such one character fleeing from battle or even something simple like finding a note on the beach. The dialogue flows pretty naturally and the game manages quite a consistent tone. The amount of consistency is pretty remarkable considering the pretty diverse cast of characters available even in this starting portion of the game. The writing is delightfully humorous, and even when more dark discussions are had, they are treated with a light sense of whimsy. This doesn't mean that everything is a joke, just that the game doesn't want to take itself too seriously.-You'll notice that this review doesn't talk about the online portions of the game. That's because I don't play games online and that even extends to this. I'm not against it, personally, and think that the idea of how it works seems nice enough. I can speak briefly of the global chat: It works. That's about all there is to it. If you have a quick question about something in the game then you can drop it in the chat and people will respond to it. The people are decent for an online community and are pretty helpful too.-The game has bugs to be sure, but every major bug in the two plus months I've been playing the game has been addressed and a ton of smaller fixes are always implemented with each release. The most nagging past issues have been: broken traps, dumb enemies, various graphical glitches, and a few story related makers and queues being ""off"" The game has never crashed on me even while in beta.

Early Access Review
								Many ask now-a-days, ""where have all the good [RPG] games gone, and where are all the [developer] gods?  Where's that [Playable] Streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?"", and ain't it all too true?  Gone are the golden days of the old school RPG's that made the genre the gods of Olympus in the world of video games: Fallout, Neverwinter, Wasteland, all genre defining titles.  Where have they gone? Well, they have been replaced with fast paced  3D, in your face, Action RPGs, that look pretty with their special effects and complex skill trees, but lack the depth of the, ""choose your own adventure in an open world"", style of PRG gameplay that everyone grew up on, and grew to love.  Well, the wait is over!Divinity seeks to place the genre back on Mt. Olympus with its phenomenal engineered throw back to the old school era of RPGs, but with its own, unique, ""new school flavor""; all wrapped in a pretty bow - as in the interactable world and environment built around it.  Dvinity plays just like the ""oldies, but goodies"", yet with a refreshing approach implementing new elements to modernize the dead genre while breathing new life into the RPG's of old.  Despite bridging the gaps by filling in the missing components of the early century Golden Age of ""bird's eye view RPG's"", Divinity reaches beyond the limitations of the earler ""industry defining"" releases in the open world RPG genre. Divinity offers an unpredented depth to character development by offering a plethora of archtypes, styles of play, and even so far as each character's personality through an AI setting to be available at release.  The ""AI"" setting is your characters disposition, which I look forward to experiencing the impact it will have with NPC interactions, and the game play as a whole.  Divinity makes the world around the player character come alive and cooexist with the player character's choices offering a synergy unlike what you have seen before in an open world, ""choose your own adventure"", RPG's.Combat is of course turn based, and strategic to say the least; in many situations, survival is contingent on using the environment to garner an edge against your enemies through spells and or skills.  Spells, certain weaponry - particularly arrows bought or crafted by Rangers- as well as skillsets also help the player navigate and negotiate dangerous environmental restrictions such as, poisonous areas, grounds scorched by fire, or frozen over by ice, and environmentally hastened, strengthened, and even weakened, enemies.  Only by negating or taking advantage of these effects can your characters safely gain passage whether they are navigating through dangerous environments, or fighting certain combatants requiring the player to use thought and purpose to progress through the game.You start with two fully customizable characters based on existing archetypes, or you can build their skill sets and spell pools to your own style of gameplay.  During your trevails, you will be introduced to companions who will join your crusade with their own personal disposition towards your actions and inactions with ongoing interactions with your player characters as the game progresses.  Your chacters themselves will also interact through dialogue to support one another's choices or to contradict eachother using skills gained during gameplay through these interactions.Divinity Original Sin offers a deeply enriched environment.  The backstory is that the player characters are ""Source Hunters"", or investigators that quell threats of people using an evil form of necromancy magic called, the ""Source"".  It all begins with the investigation into a murder at Cyseal, requiring the player character to interact with several NPC's to unravel the mystery until their investigation leads to fruition with answers to satisfy the residents of Cyseal.  Quests, in general, are multilayered requring the player to embrace thought and consideration into the process of unravelling the mysteries to find the answers their quest-givers seek.  These quests are not arms length transactions like the RPG's of old: find this, get that, kill that, come back.  Rather, quests are integrated into the fabric of the game.  Some of them require not one, two, or even three steps, but an inumerable chain of steps to achieve your ultimate goals.  This provides a sense of unity and singular purpose in discovering the solutions whereby what you decide to do in one quest, may ultimately affect the results of another or multiple quest chains.  This offers a very unique experience to RPG players both old and new.  Players generally have to interact with most of the NPCs in order to decipher what needs to be done to complete each quest, while certain quests still maintain a simple and direct passage offering diversity.  The several quests that are connected to the main quest never ends.  Once you have completed the chain in one area, it spills over to the next area, and I assume so on and so forth - I only assume because the beta ends with completing the main quest in the first area, as the following areas are currently locked out of Beta.  All the while, quest completion feels organic and intuitive so te storyline doesn't feel disconnectedl.To advance the experience further, Divinity DNA includes crafting sourced from genre defining games like the Ultima series.  You can craft an innumerable number of items, from clothing to weapons, potions to scrolls, magic items to non-magical items, all based on your crafting skills, the recipe books you have uncovered, and the simple purity of trial and error by mixing various ingredients to learn new compounds.  The crafting component offers a whole layer to the game that can keep you entertained for hours, if only to learn more combinations to create items, potions, weapons, and then twice over by mixing crafted items with crafted maigcal items to create magical properties within crafted items.Divinity: Original Sin is truly the RPG, with old school blood, of this decade, perhaps the century.  If you are a purist when it comes to ""top down, open world"" RPG's, you will not be disappointed with the depth, novelty, and versatility of this game.  Not only does the game offer a core storyline for you to playthrough, but upon full release, players will have the opportunity to create their own environments, NPCs, characters and quests of their own to upload to developer servers for others to play.  These tools offer the level of depth that most online games with similar tools could only dream of providing to their player base.You would probably expect that I would be wrapping up this review, but there's more. The game can be played single player. One of the more defining characteristics of this game is the opportunity to have one player character controlled by a second person.  You can play with a friend and divide and conquer, performing whatever actions you choose free from the other player and all across the environment.Although the game is only in Beta stage, the total time to complete this area will keep you engaged for up to 25 hours, or longer, depending upon how many rocks you turn over to find what you are looking for while completing your quests.  I can only imagine what the final release will hold with a multitude of additional areas to play through.  This is type of game that has the highest level of replayability for an RPG.  Your decisions do not weigh lightly in this game, but rather define the your experience, how those act around you, and the ultimate conclusion of your conquest.  This is worth every cent if you are an RPG lover, and Divinity: Original Sin truly sets a new precedent for all RPG titles released after its full publication.			"

												I've never had a more difficult time rating a game than Divinity Original Sin because 1) It's one of a kind. 2) Expectations were quite high for an epic RPG 3) There are so few decent turn-based and even real-time with pause RPGs so it *had* to be good, just had to...or else it was back to replays of old favorites (again).I will give it two ratings, one for my experience and one tempered with others' feedback in consideration (see below) as my personal experience score is both lower and possibly atypical. Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.The breakdown:Interactive environment (5) Story/dialog/pace - drags on, not inspiring (3) Companions  (2) lifeless (correction - 1 point for ability, 1 for existence) Graphics (4.5) Combat  (3.5) --repetitive, but neat spells/skills. Music (3.8) Edit  -- 4+ as standalone and main theme, in particular, but not in-game. Mostly very light and less inspiring in context of the atmosphere, unlike other Divinity games.Overall enemy variety & game world (5) Leveling (3.5) - slow and unrewarding though refreshingly different with Action Points.Dependability/bugs (3.5) --needs a few more patches but is mostly smooth. Replayabilty (4) (if you like it yes, if not, no) Gameplay Hours - (5) Fantastic! 60-150 hours. Tactics -- lots of cheese/repetition (3.5) Mods/Editor - (potentially 5 but to be determined). Voice acting (3) - limited. Loot (5) For loot maniacs. May be overabundant for some players.Quests  (4) --better than average, not so fetchy.Puzzles - Yes - love or hate themAtmosphere  (3) e.g. lack of dynamic weather, immersive sound and dungeons are not scary.Dynamic Events - largely absentConsequences - few or not impacting other than in combat.Map / Inventory/Journal  (2.5 to 3)Crafting - (3.5)A problem with the game is that the sum is not greater than its parts. It would make a much better 30-40 hour game than an  epic-length one, in its current state given it stalls out for story-driven, if not combat, players.But, if you come to the game with no expectations of Baldur's Gate et al. and in a light-hearted mood (for tis not a dark/mature game) your money should be well-spent. You may even love the game, some really do. If you're looking for the next epic classic RPG,though, you're on the road to disappointment. So come equipped with an open-mind for best results.***If you like turn-based RPGs Divinity Original Sin is most worth taking a look at *** and it may well one day be considered a cult classic as the niche following is strong.                                          ----------------------My personal experience rating, however, is 3.5 -3.8.I'm an older gamer and don't necessarily represent the majority of Larian fans, though love most of their games. Original Sin started as a holiday dinner and soon became two-day old, leftover turkey sandwiches after 40ish hours -- stale and bland, though a bit tasty with salt when available. I actually quit the game 3/4 the way through, from boredom,though plan to return to it someday (tm).My standards are rather distinct for an RPG and in disclosure I lean strongly towards Neverwinter Nights series or Baldur's Gate-type games (aside from strategy, open-world and select aRPGs) as well as those with darker undertones. Additionally, I even felt Shadowrun,  XCom and Disciples combat was much more enjoyable. I think with mods this game could turn around. Right now it is a diamond in the rough, or so it appears. Multiplayer may offer a ton of fun and that I am unable to comment on.Lastly, of note, my Steam hours are artificially inflated -- both with Alpha and leaving the game running. The real-hours are closer to 150, but nonetheless I well got my money's worth at that rate. The game is better than average but needs serious work to shine. Most importantly, it needs a soul.Still, future games in this genre will have a new threshold to meet in modernized cRPGs.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin it is best turn-based RPG which I've played. First what I am like in this game, this is characters creation, you can create TWO CHARACTERS (but only if you play alone), this is awesome. Also game have coop mode, jokes, great gameplay. But what important in this game you have your home, not like in Skyrim, but anyway better than nothing, also you can use food for healing and also drank some alcohol (kinda like in The Witcher 3) :-D. Storyline is pretty simple good versus evil, maybe this first and last minus in this game, also you can find some beautiful soundtracks. I think not only I like game with rich story line.Game is great!			"

												Awesome game! SO FREAKIN MUCH TO EXPLORE. People say, ""Oh, turn-based combat systems suck!"" but in this game that system is very demanding. If you make the wrong decision during your turn, it could cost you the entire battle, or even your partners life. One thing that makes this game different from other RPG games is that you level up VERY slowly. If you buy this game, DO NOT SPEND YOUR TALENT POINTS WITH HASTE. Choose carefully.

Early Access Review
								This is one of the BEST CRPG games I ever played in a long time! The Early Access is almost over and the release is comming on June 30th!I have allot of fun with this game by providing feedback and reporting bug reports. Larian Studious has done a very good job using the ""Early Access"" feature. They have been pushed to their limits allot in every single update they do and change the game dramatically from story, combat, balancing and more!. This is one of my first Early Access games, that I actually gave feedback as this game have very huge potential and probably will even get allot of awards and probably game of the year for RPG's! They have listened and adding allot of our suggestions into the game and the game is just getting better! Why do I recommend this game?- The best CRPG game I have played in along time since the OLD RPG games.- The game is very interactive from environments, items to NPC's!- They will deliver a strong toolset for modders and players who are willing to download MODS or make their own story into the game! (Yes the campaign can be modable!)- Conversation between your main characters and companions!- Customizable characters by items, skills, talents, armor, weapons and more!- Just go get it now! :PThank you Larian Studiois for this wonderful game - You defiantly will get allot of awards for this game!

												This was a present from my Friend, we played it Multi-player. This was the first time I had played anything remotely like this game, I was out of my depth. I let my Friend lead. It was going swimingly, we'd explored a beach, found a giant talking clam and fed it, and then had ended up at the town gates. I said i'd take the lead as I had more perception and I could see which way to lead the conversation, this seemed like a good idea as the two guards were completely trollied. Oh dear is all I can say. They ended up dead, and we ended up with a cheesewheel and a cook book. I have no idea how it ended up like this. My Friend was laughing so hard at the outcome that I thought he was going to wet himself. Literally. We got into the town and everything seemed to be back on track, we were making headway with the quest and we'd racked up a bit of money. Now it was time to interview a suspect, seeing how it went last time with my attempt, I didn't volunteer. It was going great until my Friend killed the guy. ""He had information we needed, why the f%&* did you kill him?"" ""He was annoying me and not telling the truth."" ""So we go out and find more evidence, then come back and talk to him again."" ""Nah this was easier, plus we can loot the place now.""My Character was too moral and didn't want to loot, so I left to talk to more people in the town. I thought I had another lead until my Friend asked if I could bail him out of Jail. He tried to sell the looted items, got caught, tried to fight the Police, failed and was in Jail. I  didn't have enough gold to bail him out so we had to restart from the previous save point. Oops! Pros:The most unique part of this game is the fact that you can change the outcome of the storyline and quests by what you say in conversations or by what you chose to say. Sometimes, this works wonders and you can make a shy person open up to you with important information or you can calm down an angry drunk to avoid a fight. The dialogue is hilarious, each little joke, each innuendo just made it for me. I especially loved the animal to human dialogue. You can do almost anything you want! You can murder people, you can steal from people, you can wander around aimlessly. You can even use your partner as a distraction and go into places you aren't allowed in. The combat system is neat. I found it easy to understand (especially considering this was my first attempt at this genre) and I was actually pretty decent at it. I could combine attacks to create terrain that would cause effect damage to enemies when they entered it. This made it easier to defeat enemies higher levels than us. The asthetics of the game are beautiful too, I felt genuinely immersed in every area I went into and I really appreciate the level of detail that went into it. In every field, you can see tones of the green/yellow grass depending on which way the sun is in the games sky. You can see shadows in the water which are fish or other objects. Cons:It was a lot of trial and error. I think we restarted the save a few dozen times as we'd managed to ruin it and promptly fail our quest. I'm putting the combat system here too, because you do have to plan out your moves accordingly. I had to think about 3 steps ahead to ensure I could defeat the enemies, or I had to run.			"

I had a few issues figuring out a couple things early on(crafting, smithing, etc), but after the first 3 hours I was really hooked on this series so much that I went and bought Divine Divinity afterwords. 9/10			"

												Where to begin with this masterpiece?Pros:+ One of the most beautiful and immersive worlds I've seen in a game to date. You can interact and barter with almost anyone (including animals if you have the talent). The graphics are grade A for a game like this and I often find myself just staring at the scenery.+ Gripping story that has you guessing whats coming next, and most of the time you guess wrong. For me, at least, it seemed most of the story came straight out of left field. I loved it.+ Combat feels engaging, challenging, and at times it can be very unforgiving. One wrong move could cost you a hero. Icy surfaces are definitely the bane of my existence, I think they get me more than anything else. But the combat itself really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you kill a group of enemies you just died 3 times on to your own stupid errors.+ The music is incredible. I constantly find myself humming along to the music, even when I'm not playing. Every song is a perfect match for whats going on in game.+ Character creation and class system is the most flexible of any RPG I've come across. You can be whatever you want to be from level one, so you don't end up with cookie cutter builds that everyone uses. This really allows you to adapt the game to your play style.+ Replay-ability. I'm still on my first play through and already I find myself thinking about and deciding what I'm going to do next time around. Almost every quest can turn out differently depending on what you do and how you play. It seems no two play throughs will ever be the same.Cons:- I'm not going to lie there were a couple bugs I've come across so far. None of which were game breaking and were fixed with a simple Save/Reload. The most common and most annoying for me if sometimes combat will start but the music wont. The only other big one I can remember was one of my companions wasn't able to be healed. But as stated saving/reloading did fix both of these bugs.- I wish it was longer. Not to say it's short because it's not by any means. I'm on my first play through level 16 and so far I've invested 76 hours of play. I really just don't want it to end.I can honestly say this is the best 40 bucks I've ever invested in a game. I highly recommend it anyone who enjoyed games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age: Origins, or Knights of the Old Republic. Anyway hope this was helpful and hope you enjoy the game.			"

												When I bought this game I did not expect to enjoy it too much, ""It's just a turn-based RPG"" is what I thought. It's not ""just"" that, not at all.Divinity: Original Sin starts of with a simple task, which is to investigate a murder, and so you start off your journey in this amazing world. Quickly you'll notice that things might not be what they look like, 'the plot thickens', and you will realize that the simple task you started with is now part of something much, much bigger. You are free to do as you please, didn't like how this guy treated you? Might as well kill him. Too bad he had some information  which could help you solve some quest, but no need to worry as you might stumble upon a clue as you move on. But you will face the consequences of your actions, if you dig the grave of a mourning woman's husband to find some loot, she will go crazy and attack you (Personal experience).This game also won't take you for dumb, from questing to combat, and even on dialogues, you'll have to put your brain to work. Quests require you to to really pay attention to whatever clues you find so you can get them done, and don't you dare look for a walkthrough! During combat you'll have to consider what kinds of enemies you are up against, what kind of enviroment are you in, is there something that you can use to your advantage? Like that barrel of water sitting next to your enemies, how about destroying it with a fireball and then throwing a lightning bolt to stun your foes, or maybe turning it into ice to make them stumble and fall.Overall this game was an awesome experience, and absolutely one of the best RPGs I've ever played, I definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a new, refreshing experience, especially those into heavily story-driven games.9/10			"

												Amazing game, made with so much love and dedication. Has the best turn-based combat system I've ever played with. Although the writing is excellent and genuinely funny at times, the main story arc is a bit convoluted and rife with RPG cliches. I played it co-op all the way through, which I can't recommend enough.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is mercilessly wonderful and frustrating. if you have even an ounce of nostalgia for the classic CRPGs you played in the mid- to late 90's and early '00s -- the ones that had really detailed manuals with illustrations and everything -- D:OS will get your♥♥♥♥♥♥hard.this game is based upon the long-abandoned philosophy of classic videogames: ""no, YOU ♥♥♥♥ing figure it out, idiot."" you're on an epic quest for some reason or other that has all sorts of grand implications... and meanwhile, you can steal anything, kill anyone, wreak all manner of havoc, and shoot fire at everything. you'll spend a lot of time running around and clicking things to see what happens (will this kill me? how many different ways can I make this explode? also, can I craft anything from this handful of zombie butts?). you'll be the driving force in an engaging story surrounded by a cast of wonderful characters with stellar quest text, voice acting, and lovely stylized character design.you are given total freedom to discover the rules (and, of course, to break them). however, the flipside of this is that it IS possible to break your game or gimp your character. you will re-load quicksaves. a lot. you will probably die. a lot.D:OS has many flaws, like its godawful UI and half-baked crafting system, but I find that those flaws are part of the charm. furthermore, the game is still being updated and tweaked, so many of these flaws are temporary. this game is addictive, frustrating, satisfying, silly, surprising, and fantastic.

												It is certainly one of the best RPG-s I've ever played. What makes it even more awesome than a lot of other RPGs you can find around - it has co-op. So, for me it was 160 hours of pure awesomeness with complete immersion into this epic world while playing with friend.This game has a lot of pros that cloud all of the problems, so here you go:- awesome story line- awesome dialogues & RP options/choices- a very nice approach to turn-based combat and it's well combined with real-time non-combat actions- nice itemization and character development, stats, skills etc.- quite hardcore, may be kinda hard for unprepared people, but if you're looking for a challenge for your strategic skills and mechanics studying - playing on hard is certainly a way to go, it's fun!- very beautiful areas and a generally good area design (in both appearance and structure)- gameplay is a well-balanced blend of combat, puzzles (a fair share of those are really interesting, got me despite the fact I hate pure puzzles), RP with optional things like stealth- non-linear progression, a lot of quests are more or less optional, but it's absolutely up to you to decide what are you doing first. assuming your gear/level allows you of course, but there's absolutely nothing that horses you to go by a corridor- worth mentioning separately: nice navigation options, you'll never walk too much just for the sake of it, waypoints all the way- remarkable soundtrackThere're unfortunately a few negative aspects, but comparing to how awesome the game is, you don't really care:- bugs. they don't take up too much time to deal with, but they may be annoying: occasional crashes (save your game often to spare your blood pressure (c) tip from loading screen), rarely you have stat problems on your characters so you have to do a simple save-load to fix it, rare disconnects if you're playing in co-op. still not too overwhelming, but after 100h in they begin to become somewhat annoying (hopefully most people finish game by this time, but not me...)- interface. overall it's fine, but some things could've been done a lot better, especially tooltips, they lack some vital details (like durations of status-effects). you'll probably have to go to wiki sooner or later for some details or just to test yourself but it takes some timeSo, to sum it up - this game is a must-play if you want a really good RPG (not something ""with RP elements"" like Borderland ot w/e) or maybe you're just looking for experience similar to Fallout. It's quite long, so be ready to allocate some time, I advice against making breaks during a playthrough.			"

												First things first: I love the Divinity universe. I own all of the games, even owning multiple copies on multiple websites, plus Divinity 2: Dragon Knight Saga on the 360. So although I technically could be a bit biased, I am going to try to give as honest a review as possible, featuring both positives and negatives.Positives:+ The music in Divinity games has always been phenomenal. Original Sin combines some of the best tracks from all of its predecessors, and WOW was I excited to hear them. Divinity 2 (360 version) came with a full music soundtrack, and that is the only video game soundtrack I keep and prize because the music is supremely beautiful. Many of those tracks are here as well, along with new tracks that keep up with the Divinity standard.+ The world is lush, beautiful. This game is very colorful while keeping its realism. This is a world you WANT to explore every nook and cranny of, which is great because this game sure makes you do it.+ The character classes are vast and varied. You can create the character you want (warrior that uses magic, a rogue/mage, etc.)+ The battle system is FUN, and the battle music is energizing. Original Sin introduces the concept of using elements and environments to make or break battles, so having your mage make it rain over the enemies before shocking them with electricity will give you the upper hand in a battle where you may have been losing.+ TONS of quests. It kind of gets to the point that is reminiscent of Skyrim, where the player can feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of quests waiting for you in your journal.+ - Free roaming. You can (and will) run into areas not really meant for you yet, because the game doesn't really block your path of progression. This can be both a positive and a negative. The game can be extraordinarily vague, where you move on to an area that seems correct, only to find out later on (after much searching the discussion boards and guides) that you should have finished part of another quest before you can progress in the one you had been trying to complete.Negatives:- Vague/Unclear Quest Progression. This is a game I went into knowing full well what I was getting into. The early access reviews mentioned it was old school and had no hand holding. But oh MY, can this game get frustrating. From the beginning, I have searched for secret areas, read all books, consulted my journal and map, etc. etc. because I knew what others had said about its difficulty. With that said, 20+ hours of my tracked gameplay has been due to backtracking, buying back items from merchants that I had no indication through dialogue or journal that I would need later, or running halfway across maps because I realized that since one quest was ""technically"" supposed to be completed before another, I needed to go back. I have never played a game that infuriated me as much as this one has in terms of not being able to progress because something miniscule was not completed/kept in my inventory/spoken clearly, etc.- Aiming in Battles. This is a turn-based RPG, so while you aim your spells/arrows/etc. in battle, your enemies stay in place. HOWEVER, enemies will move/bow/scratch their heads/pick their noses in battle, and when they do, you will find that sometimes if you left-click to attack at JUST the wrong moment, the enemy will move out of your click and your character will either shoot stupidly in the air beside the enemy's head OR walk all the way behind the enemy. I have lost battles over this one flaw, and this was not a one-time thing. This happened quite a few times, and it can screw up your strategy in moments.- Starting Difficulty. This isn't a negative, per se, but the difficulty in the beginning is much higher than the rest of the game, so it will be a big turn off for some newcomers. Enemies do not respawn, and as you start off in one area, you have to branch out, and all of your options are groups of enemies that are two levels above you, with groups larger than yours.- Broken Quests. There are a few quests in the game that you will be unable to complete. I have three sitting in my journal right now, forever in limbo. Sometimes quests or the characters involve will overlap, and if you decide to try to complete one quest before another, you may render the previous quest forever incomplete (won't give an example due to spoilers). Summary: This is a great game, no doubt. I have to say that this will probably be the first Divinity game that I will not replay, however. This is a game that can be great fun, but also greatly frustrating. It is a game expansive and challenging enough to really give you a sense of pride in progressing in, but at the same time, it is not a game you beat. It feels like this game beats YOU. I recommend this game to the fans of the most hardcore of RPGs, particularly the old school RPGs, who have a ton of time to sink into a game that requires you to pay attention to every detail. This game is NOT a game you can just pick up and jump into and out of. Missing or forgetting a detail can be severely punishing to both your progression and your patience, so be prepared to ""favorite"" a guide. ;)			"

												Co-op is very fun, the storyline keeps you engaged and all the side quests and characters are great. Character customisation is good, and you can play dual-class, which allows for a bit more freedom when designing your character. Almost finished with the game and I've thoroughly enjoyed this gameplay, the only thing that's a bit disappointing is that once you've reached max level with your character, the loot you find at the later stages of the game is a little bit underwhelming and of not much use, so opening chests isn't as exciting anymore! Also some issues with connecting with my friend in co-op at times, but we were able to work around it. Overall, I really like this game, will give Enhanced edition a go next !			"

Its a throw back to older rpg's with a deep character creation, skill system, stats and conversation system.The quests are open ended and you can get to the end of the game even if you kill every single npc in the game. You can also find secrets and areas that you will only find or find hints for if you have certain skills. Not only that there is a editor released, a very powerful one. Make your own campaigns, edit the main one, add your own models and much more!So should you buy this?Yes! If you play a lot of rpg's and you enjoy them, then you are required to own this.			"

												This game is splendificously marvellicious.Let me describe this game in a single word:  solid.  Combat, story, writing, movement, graphics, interface, every single aspect of this game is just so incredibly solid and well done, and you just keep wanting to play until the crack of dawn and/or until your eyeballs crystallize.  The story and world is just so rich and oozing with character.One minor criticism is sometimes it can be hard to know where to go, and sometimes the quest journal is a bit messy.  I stayed around in the second area for the longest time, not understanding that I wasn't supposed to really quest there yet.  Funny enough, that actually made the game more difficult, and again more enjoyable, so it ended up working out in the end.Also, never reject any quests in the game (unless they ask you to kill allies).  For example, don't reject the fabulous five, or the guy in the second area's town.  You just end up missing out on good stuff regardless of what they want you to do.Don't go with ""lone wolf"" at first if you can avoid it, get companions from the first town and play the game normally.  Also, avoid trying to min/max too hard.  Wait until your second playthrough if you want to really min/max and abuse the game, and play it on hard.			"

												Alright, so about 60-70 hours after starting my cooperative adventure with a friend, and completing the game, I think it is appropriate that I write my review of Divinity: Original Sin. Some quick context, we played the game with double lone wolf characters(A fighter and a wizard) on medium difficulty. Your experience with combat balance may vary.First, let me start off by saying that this game is fun... Like REALLY fun. However, this is less of a game, and more of an experience. Let me explain what I mean by that. First of all, the combat is incredibly enjoyable. Every encounter feels hand crafted to give players a new strategic scenario almost every time. This was a real draw of the game for the friend I was playing with. As he put it, ""it was one of the few games that actually makes a wizard feel like a wizard.""The draw for me however, was the world itself. I was in awe at this game's sense of wonder, while still remaining light hearted and humorous at times. It brought me back to childhood memories such as reading ""The Hobbit"" for the very first time. As the game went on, things got dark... Like really dark. It was probably my own fault for being so caught up in the game world, but I felt physically sick at times. This gave me a real drive to find the evil, and destroy it (trying not to be too spoilery).I've seen a lot of people complain about the endless dialogue in this game, and I can understand that, but I think it depends on what you are looking for coming into this game. I adored all of the dialogue, and being able to interact with this fantasy world that truly felt alive. Luckily, for my friend that didn't enjoy that all that much was able to find entertainment out of the combat encounters, and since we were playing on coop, I could do all of the dialogue work for him.Now, lets talk problems with the game. First of all, the game still feels like it needs to be worked on (IE missing content, and bugs). The good news about that is... It's still being worked on. Bugs and imbalances that I've found one day, I found were patched the next.A couple of the puzzles in the game straight up feel unfair. I feel no guilt in having to have looked up a couple answers online, as some of them were simply frusterating for reasons that could have been otherwise avoided.There are a few problems with clarity. I know this is suppose to be a hard-core game, not for those with a casual approach, but some things are just tedious, not challenging, nor do they help engage you with the world. The biggest example of this is inventory management. A simple fix would be to have a separate tab, similar to the keys tab, for ALL quest items. That way you aren't having to manage important quest items with loot, and you don't accidently sell any of those quest items. Even the sidequest items.Something else I should touch on is the editor. This thing brings a ton of extra value to Divinity. Whether you're a modder yourself, or you just want to play someone elses adventure. There are still some problems with it, but the development team has been supporting it quite strongly from what I've seen so far.Conclusion/tl;dr:This is all from my own experience and perspective.Number scores are pointless.I would recommend this game.

												Divinity: Original Sin, while being seemingly forgotten about following the very successful Kickstarter campaign and initial hype, lives up to every expectation now that the game is released.  A deep and meaningful storyline, gorgeous graphics and highly detailed/varied environments, clean and uncluttered UI, incredibly unforgiving and challenging yet enjoyable turn-based combat, characters that you actually care about, deep character customization, plenty of humor, an expansive gameworld, well thought out lore, numerous bosses (large and small) and a large amount of different units and enemies, traditional RPG systems....must I continue? D:OS is a memorable experience that has a very well-designed co-op that allows for drop-ins, easy transfers of inventory, and Steamworks support.  They have created a developer kit to allow for custom campaigns and content, so there is a large potential for what could be endless content.  The storyline and content in the vanilla game is very lengthy and varied itself, all while managing to avoid falling victim to mundane quests and repetitive actions.  Excellent sound design, great art style, and an enjoyable soundtrack just make the game even easier to play.  Whether playing by yourself or with a friend, D:OS is sure to provide you with many dozens of hours of enjoyment.  Highly recommend at full retail price and I believe the game has serious potential to get Game of the Year.			"

												And so it have now been released. This game is awesome. Yes there is not much more to say about this game. Its a throw back to older rpg's with a deep character creation, skill system, stats and conversation system.The quests are open ended and you can get to the end of the game even if you kill every single npc in the game. You can also find secrets and areas that you will only find or find hints for if you have certain skills. Not only that there is a editor released, a very powerful one. Make your own campaigns, edit the main one, add your own models and much more!So should you buy this?Yes! If you play a lot of rpg's and you enjoy them, then you are required to own this.			"

												This game is splendificously marvellicious.Let me describe this game in a single word:  solid.  Combat, story, writing, movement, graphics, interface, every single aspect of this game is just so incredibly solid and well done, and you just keep wanting to play until the crack of dawn and/or until your eyeballs crystallize.  The story and world is just so rich and oozing with character.One minor criticism is sometimes it can be hard to know where to go, and sometimes the quest journal is a bit messy.  I stayed around in the second area for the longest time, not understanding that I wasn't supposed to really quest there yet.  Funny enough, that actually made the game more difficult, and again more enjoyable, so it ended up working out in the end.Also, never reject any quests in the game (unless they ask you to kill allies).  For example, don't reject the fabulous five, or the guy in the second area's town.  You just end up missing out on good stuff regardless of what they want you to do.Don't go with ""lone wolf"" at first if you can avoid it, get companions from the first town and play the game normally.  Also, avoid trying to min/max too hard.  Wait until your second playthrough if you want to really min/max and abuse the game, and play it on hard.			"

												This game kicks♥♥♥♥♥  It was definitely difficult to figure out where to get started.  My friend and I died quite a few times just testing out which enemies we could even survivie against in the early stages.  But it has already beens do rewarding.  Once the momentum started rolling we could hardly stop playing.  Game is a ton of fun and the co-op aspect just puts it over the top.  Thus far this game has provided me with nothing short of thrilling turn based combat.My main gripe so far: inconsistent multiplayer connecting.  Once it gets started it is fine, but my friend and I are baffled as to why the connection fails so often.  We put hours into figuring this out and... it still fails *all* the god damned time.  I'm not bad with his stuff: I have dealt with many convoluted and broken multiplayer systems; I have hosted my own servers for games. The online multiplayer struggles are a black eye on what has otherwise been, as I said above, an awesome rpg experience.Anyway, still highly recommend it but I hope that the devs get these connection issues sorted.

												TL;DR An enjoyable romp through isometric RPG nostalgia that is slightly marred by bugs and a slight lack of polish. 8.5/10 would endorse its purchase.For those of us who grew up with the isometric RPG greats, it was heartbreaking to see the genre remain unrepresented and aging as the 2000's crept on. As the developers of these games were slowly cannibalized by triple A studios, hopes for long awaited sequels were seemingly dashed and the genre seemed to only exist in blips on the emerging indie scene. And then suddenly, there was crowd funding. Larian studios had a vision, they knew what they wanted to accomplish. They wanted to bring the glory days back, and build something amazing. Divinity: Original Sin might be one of the best and most polished examples of Kickstarter done right. Instantly with character creation the game evokes that marvelous feeling of choice that has been missing from the more popular RPG's of the current generations. I'll be the first to admit that I probably started 6-7 new games, trying out various combinations and watching a few of them fail miserably, happily. Finally, an RPG that reunites me with a long lost love of mine, the potential to fail horrifically. So badly even, that you could waste hours of your time and not be able to pass various challenges the game throws at you due to negligent character creation. As far as the story goes, I wasn't particularly moved nor was it very novel. However, it did progress well and kept the ball rolling. I do think that the challenge of the game and the thrill of exploration will push you to continuing the game more than the main storyline will. This game is filled with little, tantalizing secrets and interesting sidequests. Some events occured during sidequests that I never would have expected nor experienced in any other RPG. Combat is sufficient, but by no means is it fantastic. The most interesting aspect of it is how much it utilizes the environment. Some seemingly one-sided fights can be overcome with setting up explosive barrels, laying traps or creating barracades. Once again choice and planning are showing through as a main development philosophy. There were things that annoyed me. Enemies sometimes glitch out, simply standing still doing nothing even though there is nothing impeding them. Strangely it can be difficult to click on some enemies, making your character waste precious AP in the early game by moving when you wanted to attack or caste a spell. This can be especially annoying when you completely whiff a spell or god forbid send your mage to his/her death by moving them into a large group of enemies. Luckily, the game allows you to quicksave AT ANY CONCIEVABLE POINT, however a bit of polish could have done wonders. Towards the end of the game, combat becomes a tiring unengaging affair. After about 50 hours or so, you've seen every possible engagement and know how to successfully handle all of it.I mentioned that a bit of polish could have done wonders, and I think that leaks into many parts of the game. The UI is useable but by no means fantastic. Crafting is annoying and not particularly engaging. At the time of this little review, the game liked to crash during combat and cutscenes every now and again (Thank god for that quick save button).At the end of the day, I sank 80 hours into this game. I enjoyed it thoroughly and even though this copy of mine was a gift, I would not regret purchasing it. Its charm and playability overcame its bugs and quick development. I hope we see more like this from Larian in the future and I hope other devs take note on how successful a game like Divinity: Original Sin can be.			"

												Dialog and exploration is the game strong point. Unfortunately at present the mix between text dialog and voice dialog is terribly confusing because they overlap too many times and too quickly so you kinda miss stuff especialy if you like to take your time as in an RPG and enjoy the character interactions.As per the turn-based combat, is realy good tbh. Very intuitive to visualy and quickly understand how many action points you still have until you ""pass"" and it's realy not overly complicated nor terribly slow/tactical. Animations in combat are realy flashy so that helps a little for it not being boring or slow.Coop is a diferent world that what we are used to see. If you play with a friend the dialog options (and decisions) are shared by both and both can disagree and that leads to truly fun discussions. I just love making my wife mad by just disagreeing with everything she wants in-game, it's priceless.About the game uniqueness, i believe it's the ""old school"" vibe of RPGs, and especialy the feeling that you are not being ""led"" and ""hand-hold"" by the game. When you discover something or acomplish something cool, you feel proud because you were smart enough to do that on your own and don't feel you were pushed into it. Also the freedom to do whatever you want in choices and still be able to progress in the game. You can kill a quest giver you don't like because you have the ""urge"" to do it, and it's fine most of the time you can get a similar quest in a diferent way later on.It's a game that chalenges you to do what you feel it's interesting. It doesnt scream at you to do stuff the way the developers wanted because they think its the proper way to do it, it doesnt punish you too much if you want to experiment alone. It has that old school vibe in a time that games were suposed to be about player interaction, and not so much as watching a movie on trails.Can't explain much better. If you like 10 hour action packed games that look like a movie, don't play this. If you like a chalenging and rewarding game that doesn't tell you everytime what you ""should be doing"" this is worth it.I would wait a couple days for a patch tough, the dialog is too confusing atm.

												[NOTE: Think carefully before buying this game if you're thinking it'll be like Path of Exile or Diablo. Because it's not, and the difference between those types of games and this one is very important.]As you read this, keep in mind that I'm not far into the game at the time of writing. I spent some hours in game during Early Access, but waited to do this review until release to experience it in a more complete state, so these are more my initial impressions than a proper review and are subject to change at a later date (all alterations will be noted).First off, as the note above says, this game is not to be confused with something like Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile. While those are all fine games in their own right (yes, even Diablo 3), they are also ARPGs, which put you in real-time combat that more often than not comes down to spamming AOE skills to kill hordes of enemies. And that's fine, I love those games, too because they're good for quick co-op play. This game, however, being turn-based, places more emphesis on careful planning and development becasue rushing in to a fight and just relying on basic attacks will get you (and your co-op partner if you have one) killed in no time flat. So if you want a game you can dive into and mow through hordes of enemies, this isn't the game for you.One key aspect of this game that will turn most people off is that it doesn't hold you hand. Yes, you can change the difficulty of the game, but thge UI itself doesn't have some features that other RPGs seems to think players need. There's no quest tracker, only a quest log that is just a list of what you've accomplished so far along a quest line (no hints). There's no quest markers on the map or compass, so you're on you own when it comes to finding where to go and what to do next (. There's no indicators on NPCs to say who has quests for you, and talking to NPCs is an actual dialog instead of a one-sided stream of text. And as far as a tutorial goes? Yeah, it's a quick dungeon that just tells you how to do a few things in the game, leaving you to learn everything else as you go. And you have to wonder, why did we need all of that stuff anyway? Half the fun of old RPGs like Ultima was in wandering around, finding out things for yourself and possibly getting killed because you wandered into a really high level area and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥something off (I did that a lot. It was fun).Control wise, this game plays like you'd expect a CRPG to play, and you quickly get used to using WASD to move the camera. However I wish the camera rotation was 360 by default as some of the angles make it hard to see things. You can switch to a ""Tactical"" view that'll highlight your party and enemies, switching you to a more top-down perspective, which I like as it can make planning easier during solo games.Navigating the character panel can seem a bit confusing, since the same window handles stats, inventory and equipment. But it only appears that way. Once you spend a moment to look it over and know what is where, it actualy makes more sense than having seperate windows. Although Skills are in a seperate window, but you only get new ones by reading expensive Skill Books (not leveling) so this seperation makes sense.EDIT #1: I've spent a good 2-3 hours wandering around the first town trying to solve a murder, earned an achievement that I didn't notice until after I quit the game, and I still ahve no idea who I'm suposed to talk to or arrest. I am literilly just doing random crap in the hopes that it works. In the process I have gained 6 quests, died in combat (for stealing) 3 times, died buy a massive booby-trap once, and had to retrace a good portion of my progress because I forgot to save before I got killed by guards... Best. Game. EVER.EDIT #2: I'm now close to 20 hours into the game. There have been many deaths, several rage quits, a few instances of pleading ""Help!"" on the forums and a brief span of time in which I was forced to lower the difficulty in order to progress (shocking, I know). In that time I have learned several things. 1st; SAVE. Do it often. 2nd; Some boss encounters will aggrivate you to no end, so when all else fails, run... seriously, turn and run like a girl with her panties on fire. 3rd; There are some quests that seem as if their just there to troll you. And understand that all this progress and I'm *STILL* not done with all the quests in the beginning town and surrounding area. This is going to be a 100+ hour game for me and my OCD brain.EDIT #3: There are moments in this game where it pulls a Gandalf and all but screams ""You shall not pass!"" Going along a quest line, when the highest level of the last enemy you faced was 9 (the same level as you) and suddenly it jumped to 15? That's a BIG hint from the gmae, telling you to go do something else, first.			"

												This is a perfect example of game made possible by Kickstarter and Early Access programs. Not bound by publisher desire to split everything into DLCs and make everything more causal.This is a classic CRPG with a turn-based combat. And when I say CRPG - I mean it.Don't like reading? This game is probably not for you - there are tons of amazing dialogues (but they do require a lot of reading).Don't like hard games? This game is probably not for yo - combat is very hard, but fair. Be ready to use your environment, combine spells and act smart. Oh, yeah, and to save often.Add incredibly gorgeous looking engine, pretty nice soundtrack, high quality animations, nearly bug free experience (thanks to Early Access) and you'll get Divinity: Original Sin.More info in the video:

Early Access Review
								I can't not even begin to describe how much you need to play this game.  If you are a D&D-er, you need this game.  If you are a tabletop player of any kind, you need this game.  If you are an RPG fan, you need this game.  If you are a tactical thinker, you need this game.  If you are a level designer, you need this game just for the toolkit.  Bottom line, if you don't have Divint: Original Sin, do you even game?As you can tell, I love Divinity.  It's a sort of a throwback to the Baulder's Gate type of game, and it is brilliantly executed.  The environments are amazing.  The monsters are well done.  The dialog is engaging and meaningful.  Choices matter.  All good.  But, this wouldn't be a proper review without some honest critiques of how it could be improved.First negative, class balance.  This was a probably early one in the beta, but it's better now the day before launch.  It's still not completely fixed, though.  Intelligence based builds still rule in terms of raw, content-clearing power.  But, the game is still more fun with a diverse group make up.  It's not a big issue, but it's one the min/maxer may pick up on pretty quickly.Second negative, limit on co-op players.  You can only play co-op with two players.  The reasons are understandable, and it's largely forgivable given that more players are supported for mod content.  But, after playing though 8 hours of the story with a friend yesterday, I can't help but feel that this whole experience would just be phenomenal with a full group of 4-6 people.  Just the shenanigans with two were hilarious.  I think of the eight hours I might have spent 3 not on fire, not being melted by steam clouds, or not being shocked to death by jumping lightning in the rain.  Friendly fire is real, and watching a completely new player learn the system while playing a wizard was gloriously painful.  I long so much to have that same experience with more people, more wayward spells, more poorly conceived plans, more failures, more accidental explosions, all around more WTF.Lastly, the crime system.  Let me just say that even a ""good"" character is probably going to resort to a degree of thievery to fill their purse.  It only makes sense.  It's hard to descibe why this is the case.  Much of it has to do with a somewhat low drop rate for your needed skill books as you progress and the very readily available goods that can pilfered with impunity.  Once you finally come across that NPC who has your skill books you need, every painting in the room will start to look like... well... yours.  That's not a bad thing.  Temptation is a good mechanic in these sorts of games.  But, in the first town alone, I racked up well over fifteen thousand gold just from yanking up whatever I could carry when no one was looking.  We could probably use a few more guard patrols to make having a rogue more necessary (needing to pick locks quickly instead of just having time to bash them to pieces).Overall, I'm a solid 9.5/10 on this game.  The issues that are there are minor (except the co-op player limit which is in fact raised for mods).  You owe it to yourself to play this game.  Don't be turned off by words like ""turn-based.""  While it is turn-based, it's the type of turn-based that moves quickly and doesn't detract from the overall experience.  It actually enhances your experience.  You'll need to see it all in action to understand, but I stand by the fact that you need to try it.  Get this game.  If it's not in your cart already, you're doing it wrong.Summary+Great gameplay+Amazing environments+Compelling dialog+Awesome spell/ability system+Very well done co-op mode+Choices matter+Good music+Loads of content-Co-op player limit of 2 for the main story-Some class/abilty imbalances-Thievery is way too easy, so much that it doens't make sense not to do it++New players will kill you by accident... a LOT+++I charged a skeleton and whacked it with my sword.  My buddy broke an oil barrel, summoned a fire elemental, ignited the whole thing, caught two ""suicide bomber"" skeletons with explosives tied to their backs in the initial boom, and we waited for the fire and smoke on the screen to clear to find out everything including our own party were dead and toasty.  Came back and got fried by that same buddy's electricity in the rain.  Must... play... more.			"

Early Access Review
								Divinity: Original Sin is an exciting RPG the brings story writing to those passionate about RPG games. It doesn't depend on voice acting, expensive CGI cutscenes and carefully tailored ""streamlined"" (read: dumbed down for higher mass appeal) gameplay.The game offers refreshing mechanics, deep storylines, and intriguing character customization. During almost the whole gameplay you have 5-10 different quests to take on. It's up to you when you prefer talking to a bunch of people or dive into a battle headfirst.Speaking of battles! Tactics do matter big time. The creators put effort in making clashes with the enemy different. Rain, oil filled barrels, a pesky priest resurrecting the fallen foes from an (almost) perfectly defended spot push you to situations where you carefully need to plan your every step. (If you like to play on hard, as I do.)At this point the interface, although functional, could use a few shortcuts. Getting a grip on your inventory can be problematic a few hours in. Using skills on items by someone (identify, repair) are currently a chore. I can recommend this game to any RPG enthusiast, who likes the general feel and effort put in old school games, but also wants to see updated graphics, and improved gameplay mechanics.			"

								Briliant, intriguing and immersive: I am a first generation gamer, started with pong in the 70's and moved on to Atari, Commodor, Nintendo and so on... I have noticed through out the years that the games have become easier and easier to play, just for the sake of profit making, but this game made me feel intelligent once again. The game was taking my intelectual needs as a veteran player very seriousely. It was very nostalgic of an era when you felt that playing a game was actually worth your time ( Like the Legend of Zelda and Shadowrun on super Nintendo). After many years of putting down my joystick, once again i experienced sleepless nights, houres of full concentration flying by in a breath, using every bit of my Neurons that were giving me ""Nerdgasms"" one after another. ( Though the wife and kid are not very happy about it...) This game is made by true gamers in heart and soule, for gamers with a lot of heart and soule. The playability is just excellent and worth every peny that you spend on it.			"

												This game is the real deal. It is a modern Baldur's Gate/Ultima VII that really raises the bar for interactivity and freedom in a western RPG. However, it does demand your undivided attention. Divinity: Original Sin is NOT a game that you can pick up and play offhandedly. The world and characters are rich and the game makes no effort to hold your hand through any of it. When you want something, you have to reach out and grab it yourself. For many players, this could be an obstacle. I had a lot of fun discovering the different ways I could use objects and the environment in all the different situations. I struggled at first with D:OS, because I was limiting myself to using what I had learned in other RPGs that were much more shallow when it came to interactivity.From the outset, you're allowed to walk into areas you clearly are not yet meant to see. You're allowed to progress quests that are too dire for you. You are allowed to do absolutely anything you want after the brief introduction. You can fight guards (and probably die), you can rob people, you can accuse people of things they did not commit. There's no ""perfect"" game, and especially refreshing is the fact that there is no good-evil continuum. There are only actions and reactions. The first barrier to new players is realizing that there is no point at which the game will solve a problem for you.The second barrier is realizing that this is a game where it pays to think as if it was real life. If you can't find a key, you can bash the door down. If someone has something you want.. well, you can satisfy their request in exchange for the item... or you can buy it from them (EVERY NPC can be bartered with). Or, you can simply kill them and take it. You can kill that person, but the people they know might be overcome with sadness and become unwilling to help. If they know you killed them, their friends might just try to kill you. If you find a pumpkin, you can carve it with a knife and wear it on your head. If you pick up a bucket, you can also wear that, but it will be difficult to see. If you have the teleport spell, you can teleport enemies into objects for severe crushing damage. You can steal a candle from an inn and later use it to ignite a pool of oil in battle. Water and blood conduct electricity. And that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of just how deep this game really is...D:OS really covers its bases if you're somebody who gets extreme joy in thinking ""outside-the-box"". If you're on the fence in deciding whether or not to buy, I would say go ahead and pull the trigger. This game holds a ton of value, even with the current $40 price tag. 9.5/10			"

								Looking for a fun tactical turn based rpg? looking to play with a friend like u have always wanted? well then this is the game for you. Yes it is still in alpha so there are bugs, and unfinished items/features but when it comes down to it, it is very fun. My friend and i  have logged around 17 hours and no loss of intrest, great class system by allowin u to specialize in one thing or branch into a very diverse class of your own!, the addiion of being able to play with your friend and talk strategies mid combat and or debate on dialoge choice is great! Very solid game so far in its alpha state and only going to get better. I Recommend if u like anything like FFT,Ogre Battle. Rainbow moon, ETC!			"

												Remember when Dragon Age: Origins was touted as the heir to the CRPG? Well, Divinity: Original Sin is much, much more deserving of that title. Not to besmirch Dragon Age: Origins, a wonderful game in its own right, but Divinity is more than a homage to the classics reborn for today's gamers. It's the classic reborn, not limited by a console, not limited by a publisher, not limited at all. This is hardcore CRPG full stop. Do you long for a return to Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, or the original Fallout games? Divinity: Original Sin is what you have been waiting for. Truly a new classic, I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Quick Impressions (3 hours in):This game is incredibly polished compared to most other games I've played recently.  It was developed on Kickstarter and the extra time and support the fan base's commitment to the developers has been Well rewarded with this creation.I've played through the tutorial 'dungeon' and starting area, and got a pretty good feel for the mechanics, combat, and overall feel of the game.  If this game is as large as I've read it is, and if the detail and entertainment value hold up as highly as the first few hours have, this is going to be an instant classic.Let's start off with what I liked most:     Graphics.   I have a pretty powerful pc, but have still had a few hitches on some recent games.  Not a single one on D:OS.  With the graphics cranked up to ultra the game is absolutely beautiful.  With spell effects and weather effects going off, everything runs smooth as silk, not a single stutter or slowdown.  The level of detail is very good, terrain, textures, animation, all excellent.  And the Attention to detail is also obvious.  You'll see exactly what I mean the first time you attempt to 'sneak' with one of your characters, LOL.Sound.  Captivating musical score, excellent voice acting that actually sounds professionally produced and directed!   I've read elsewhere that not all interactions are voice-acted, but given how large a game this promises to be, I'm willing to forgive that.   The environmental ambient sounds add well to immersion.  Combat sounds are also good; solid and realistic.Combat.  This is turn-based and right up my alley.  I've always preferred using tactics during combat and enjoy having the freedom to plan out my moves, rather than engaging in a mindless clickfest or spamming hotkeys until they cooldown.  While games like Diablo and Path of Exile have their merits,  it's refresing to discover that true turn based tactical combat models are still alive and kicking.Character Development.  There are more classes to choose from starting out than most other rpgs offer, and one quickly discovers that these are really just starting templates,  as you have the option to fully customize any character into exactly the model you desire.  Some combinations will work better than others and discovering these can be a lot of fun.  In any case, many recent rpgs (especially mmos) have fallen into the trap of trying to 'balance' every character class, which only results in classes that are merely clones with minor asthetical differences.Inventory and Crafting.  It's clear even from the start that there will be a Ton of options and items to collect and create while one travels through this game.  And it's also quite refreshing to play a game that doesn't throw too much 'uber' at you at once.   I compare this to Diablo 3, a game I really do enjoy, but whose loot system still feels broken and overpowered well after the lauded expansion.And a few things I Did find fault with:The User Interface is good for the most part, pretty standard fare, as you can see from the screenshots on the store page.  Menus and popups aren't difficult to navigate, but I did have some trouble with inventory management.  Nothing severe, just some issues with moving items from one character to another, finding particular books and recipes, that sort of thing.  It may just take some getting used to, but I was hoping for something a little more streamlined.Camera controls:  Movement is acceptable, being basically a left click to move the selected character.   My main complaint is with the camera rotation.  Unless I'm missing something, it appears that the player is locked into a 90 degree arc that limits the actual ability to 'look around'.  The camera will only shift from Northwest to Northeast.  With occlusion in the dungeons and behind walls, this gets to be a little annoying.  Occluding terrain will turn transparent to show your your characters but objects and interactible characters can still be hidden sometimes until you move to and rotate the camera just right.  I have to wonder why they didn't just go with 360 rotation..Those minor concerns aside, I still Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys CRPGs.  The pluses far outweigh the negatives and the price is absolutely right ($40 is a Bargain for a quality game these days!).  If you'd like to engage in some good old school fantasy roleplaying that channels the pen & paper spirit of Baldur's Gate, mixes in some epic gameplay ala Diablo 3 and tops it all off with the high level tactical combat of XCOM and Jagged Alliance, do yourself a favor and buy this game.

												I read the reviews for this game, I watched the videos.And I anticipated it very strongly.New elemental systems! ""Why is something in the game? Because the player can do something with it!"" Such promise, such a fresh approach. Wow.But now that I've played it...the battles are tough, which is fine, but if you don't happen to have an element in your party then you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck if you hope to make a fight possible. Fighting some hellhounds? Better have lots of water spells handy, didn't bring some water spells because nobody told you that you should have some on character creation? Well now you die, a lot. Have fun.Why is something in the game? Because the player CAN do something with it, but with gold so plentiful, why would you bother crafting a damn thing? Answer: you wouldn't. Vendor trash EVERYWHERE.The quests were spruiked as having huge amounts of freedom in how you complete them. This isn't true. They are very linear, go here, take this object, talk to that person, kill this critter. Try to do any of that out of order? Game doesn't respond. You have to go through the motions ""in whichever way you want"".The game as a whole seems to be a one-trick pony. Yeah the elemental stuff is neat. It gets pretty repetitive though and the slow level progression and tough fights make it very frustrating if you happen to lose one and have to go back half an hour to the latest save (if you forgot to quicksave).

								***Alpha Impressions***I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of RPGs and/or turn based games. It is certainly very rough around the edges but there is ALOT of promise here. I have played a little bit of single player and ALOT of co-op. Very fun co-op. A few things that do bug me but im sure will be fixed later concerning co-op. The player hosting the game will have control over all of the henchmen you get. This can make for a little boredom for the 2nd player during battles. Keep that in mind. Also if you are having issues figuring out how to start co-op.....Click join and then pick your friend on the steam overlay and join game. Make sure to use some sort of communication outside of the game as there is NONE in the game at all. I hope they add some sort of voice/text chat in the game at some point. Also you will be joining someone else's game so be sure to discuss with them what type of character you want so that they can premake them for you!Graphics are pretty good. Sound is good when its working properly. Sometimes it cuts in and out and the music can get a little loud at times even with it turned down. Play control is a little slow and a tad sloppy but that is to be expected during an alpha. There are some balancing issues for sure. Mages seem way overpowered right now. Ranger is not very good at all IMO. You do virtually no damage. I have played alot of hours as a ranger and have started leaning towards spellcasting even with my ranger!Have had a few minor glitches but overall this is very playable. I have very high hopes for this game. "

												Even in this early alpha state, the game sets itself apart in more ways than I can go into here.  There is a sense of freedom in this game that is thoroughly refreshing.  It is clear that Larian Studios has put a great deal of thought, time and effort into this already.  It's easy to get drawn in to what you are doing because the environment reacts accordingly.  You are free to develop your character outside of class boundaries.  You are encouraged to develop the characters individually.  The player isn't forced to play the characters as friends.  They can argue and have disputes, intimidate, charm and convince one another.  This I found to be particularly appealing, and it went a long way towards drawing me in.  For the most part, the dialog choices aren't your standard Good, Neutral and Bad either, which is also nice.  There is no moral compass other than the one you bring.  The fact that Larian has made a genuine effort to address these possibilities speaks volumes to the direction and depth they're bringing to the title.Larian has taken that same approach with the players’ interaction with the environment.  The player isn't in a static environment and has a level of interaction with the environment that is unparalled in games of this type.  This sense of freedom, of ‘what can/should/would I do?’ is throughout all aspects of the game, from the pacing to the crafting system and all of the other things I have yet to try.  It does a great job of keeping you curious, entertained and occupied because there is very little in this game that is linear or forced upon the player.  I find it easy to get drawn into the world they are building because I can do things in the time and manner of my choosing.  With what they’ve got going on with the character development, the environment, the crafting, the magic system, the audio, and everything else Larian has demonstrated a fantastic creative spirit and attention to detail.I still stand by everything I've stated above.  This game is amazing.			"

But Alexey Pajitnov in the very person, of course! And he asks me for a Tetris game but suddenly he's killed by an explosive sheep who in fact is a KGB undercover agent. Meanwhile me and the other me are still arguing about who's gonna play Tetris against Pajitnov, even though there's no Pajtnov anymore and but so we call it a day, just glad of being able to spell Pajitnov correctly four times in a row.

												When I first heard of this game, I thought nothing could evoke that classic D&D feeling in gaming ever again. I've always disliked how games slowly but surely evolved to hold your hand and limit the amount of thought required to overcome challenges or problems. This game, however, is a refreshing take on figure it the **** out yourself RPG's of yore. The tutorial is a bare-bones, but sufficient . Crafting is trial and error, not to mention loads of fun. Combat feels like a tabletop RPG, similar to Fallout 2 or D&D. And finally, the weakest point is the story, but even then it holds it's own. On top of all that, it's designed to be modded... I can't wait to see some D&D modules show up to play!TLDR?BUY THIS GAME AND FIND SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH, IT'S THE SHIZZLE.9/10			"

												Just to be helpful for wanna be buyers, the short condensed version:Pro's:- Absolutely Baldur's Gate 2014- Looks pretty good- Challenging at first, later on it is rather easy to beat the game (dunno if this is a pro or a con), but then again very few games remain challeging to the last scene- Immersing, good storyline, believeable world- Very atmospheric- Some good irony and humour here and then- Good choice of gear, talents, perks, abilities- Good difference between combat classes and at the same time great choice to mix classes as you see fit- Baldur's Gate that you can play with your sister! (or friend or whoever)Cons:- Some annoying bugs with quests that did not complete due to the order in which I handled things- You basically start in a huge town and spend the first few hours talking endlessly- A lot of the conversations are rather lengthy and only suited for hardcore lore fanatics- All loot is randomized, but some high level areas drop very low level loot (they might fix this)- And my main annoyance: This game is 1/3 about exploring and talking, only 1/3 about combat, and a bloody 1/3 about puzzles, that would take anyone hours to figure out without help of internet. If you like to be challenged by finding a book here and a switch there, then a sacred bone elsewhere hidden in a bush, then this sure will be your thing. Personally I would like a tad more fighting and a bit less wandering about in search for a key.All in all a good game for people that love isometric fantasy games, it delivers what might be expected of the genre. If long ago you enjoyed Baldur's Gate, then this will suit you well.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin was one of the best surprises I've had in gaming in a long while.I've played a couple of Larian Studios' previous games: Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity.  I thought both games were okay, but they weren't so great that they made me a fan of Larian Studios.  So when I bought Divinity: Original Sin last month, thanks to a sale, I didn't have particularly high expectations.  I figured the game would be fun enough to tide me over until PIllars of Eternity came out in late March, 2015.Boy was I wrong.  And I'm glad I was wrong.  D:OS turned out to be one of the very best computer roleplaying games I've ever played.  I think so highly of it for several reasons: It has a tremendous amount of content I did not know how long the first playthrough would take.  I figured I'd get at least 50 hours of gameplay out of it.  I ended up taking 216 hours to complete my first playthrough of the game.  This game was fun and fascinating throughout all of those 216 hours.Before Divinity: Original Sin, I had NEVER spent over 120 hours on a single playthrough of a CRPG.  I'm guessing I completed Planescape: Torment - one of my all-time favorite video games - for the first time in under 100 hours.  Similarly, my first playthroughs of open-world RPGs like Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and Fallout 3 took me about 100 hours or so.  Out of nowhere I wind up buying this RPG from a relatively unknown studio, and I end up being engaged by it longer than most other games I've ever played.I think a majority of gamers who play this game will like the amount of content it has to offer.  It has A LOT.  On top of that, it provides the user enough motivation to play it more than once. Some of the best RPG itemization I've ever seen Managing the itemization of a roleplaying game can be ridiculously challenging.  Take for example Fallout: New Vegas.  I enjoyed F:NV quite a bit.  I've clocked in maybe 300 hours of playtime in New Vegas across multiple (attempted) playthroughs.  One of my few complaints about that game was its itemization.  Specifically, it did not take long for me to acquire what I considered to be optimal gear in any of my playthroughs.  I preferred to play the game as a gunslinger who's friendly with the NCR, so for me the best firearms as well as the best armor were found in the Honest Hearts DLC. Once I completed Honest Hearts, I had the guns and the gear I knew I'd be using for the rest of the game.  Everything else I found was sold so I could accumulate a silly amount of caps that I would not spend on anything.Divinity: Original Sin does not have this problem.  In fact, it has some of the best itemization I've ever seen in an RPG or any other video game.The power of all equippable items in the game are influenced by item rarity (Common, Magical, Rare, Legendary, Unique).  At a certain point in the game, you'll want all of your items to be Legendary or Unique.  Item power is also determined by the level of the item.  So a level 15 Legendary item is going to be more powerful than a level 10 Legendary.Because of the way Larian designed their loot, there is the possibility of finding upgrades all the way until the end of the game.  This made every single combat victory, every single hidden treasure chest, and even every single search-able crate a fun experience, because you never know when or where you'll find the weapon, armor, or magical goodie you'll use to beat the game.I really can't rave enough about the desing of Divinity: Original Sin's loot.  Whenever I engage in a discussion about how itemization can be done right, I will use D:OS as one of my top examples.**Too many good things to say, really**This review has already become much longer than I intended.  The bottom line is that Divinity: Original Sin is an excellent game.  If you like RPGs influenced by classics like Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate, if you like fantasy games, or if you enjoy games that mix humor with quality storytelling, then you'll probably enjoy the hell out of this game.

The Real RPGI played Divinity: Original Sin long time ago but I realized with the upcoming release of the secund episode that I didn't reviewed the first one. So here I am.First of all, I will not talk about the story except to tell that the lore, the scenario and the (primary and side) quests are very good, you will find quiet and peacefull quests, fighting, enigma... It's very complete and credible.The fighting system is also good, with strategic view, lot of possibilities, many ways to win a fight, at the end, maybe after few loading, you will win but always with difficulty and that is the point of a balanced game.The ""way to play"" is totally up to you depending your character, how you build it, the specialization you took and how you manage your team.About the team, the game can be done with a friends, which is very more enjoyable than playing alone (each players control his own character and a pnj).The graphic is good, some places are very beautiful some are ""good"". I regret that it missed more epicness in the landscapes.Music is more than good, I really appreciated the different themes.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Music: 7/10Story: 9/10 "

												Absolutely fantastic, game of the year quite easily for me. Hell, I would say that this is easily the game of the new millenium so far, damn near nothing can even remotely come close to how much fun I have had with this game. It might damn near supplant Baldur's Gate 2 as my favorite game of all time.Ok, I've gushed about it enough but I haven't said a damn thing about the game proper. The gameplay is fantastic, this game encourages exploration out the♥♥♥♥♥ there are secrets and easter eggs everywhere. Combat is satisfying and magic is powerful with many great area denial abilities. The story is cliche, but in a good way in my personal opinion. It really feels like a good old fashioned campaign of D&D with great friends (and that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you'll figure out which companion that guy is.) Dialogue and writing overall is quite good with plenty of humor and it never really takes itself seriously. Character customization is pretty strong, at least in the vein of what your character can do, not appearance so much. DivOS follows a classless system that is flexible enough to allow for multiclassing to become every bit as powerful as specializing is, though the game does stumble in the area of having a few non-combat skills be mostly useless in many situations. Lockpicking for instance can be very useless, since every chest has a key which can be found via exploration or pickpocketing, or by simply bashing/blasting the chest itself open if you so desire. Now as to customising your characters appearance there are limited options, but at the very least it is possible to dye your armors a different color so that you can look a specific way, though it can be difficult to find enough dyes to get your clothes set.When it comes to loot, DivOS went the randomly generated route. Randomly generated loot has some pros and cons, just like hand place loot does. The cons of randomly generated loot is that to many the loot never really feels special and will often be useless for people in the party and in DivOS that can certainly be the case at times. However I also submit that randomly generated loot encourages exploration every bit as much as hand placed loot does. People often cite Morrowind as an excellent example of the glories of hand placed loot, with many otherwise useless caves holding a valuable artifact that rewards you for exploring it. While certainly true, it is really only rewarding the first time around, since you will always know that that item is there so you always know to go there to get it. Morrowind veterans, myself included, know of dozens of place to get powerful artifacts with minimal effort, and while fun it can rapidly become a ritual for the game, which can swing either way of being great or terrible. DivOS on the otherhand opts for a more Diablo-esque loot system, with randomized loot that encourages you to seek chests and fight bosses for the best stuff which I find to be quite enjoyabe as well. Ultimately I enjoy both systems provided they are done well, I just felt it was something you need to know.Graphics are perfectly passable and enjoyable, it is always simple to tell what everything is and the art style of the game is quite good with few standout ridiculous armors or weapons, barring most of the robes unfortunately. Sound design is as per usual for all Divinity games absolutely excelent, with an amazing soundtrack made up of  excellently remastered tracks from past divinity games as well as many new tracks. Voice acting, what little there is of it, is enjoyable...at least the first few times you hear it, but it will eventually drive you to hate it, or love it. Personally I have taken to loving some of the idle chatter of some NPCs, and hating others.Game length is quite satisfying as well, sitting at around 60ish hours from what I understand. I personally took significantly longer since I wound up developing a taste for reloading boss fights to do them over and over again, but I can confidently say that of my 200 hours as of writing only 20 of them were spent on the game back when it was in early access, and I enjoyed all 200 of them a great deal, and look forward to adding more via coop and mods. I can go on for a while longer, but for the sake of simply ending this review I'll just say that I can't recommend this game enough, Larian created a true classic with this one.			"

												While the game still has some bugs and rough edges (such as stat-reset in multiplayer upon joining and the animation skeleton showing when using some skills, etc), the game itself more than makes up for it.There is plenty to do and much to explore - it manages to appeal to both modern game lovers and oldschool gamers, combining modern and old into a working package of grand adventure. The gameplay is clever and interesting, allowing for different ways of solving fights and problems. Characters and interaction are especially good and differ from the norm for these kinds of games. The co-op makes for a fun way of playing, while single player allows for being nitpicky to the most minor of details.Combined with a good soundtrack, pleasing art style and some solid story and gameplay, this game is a good addition to anyone's library.

TL;DR: High customization, unlimited actions/consequences, and they best top down RPG combat ever. I really recommend this game. 10/10, would disgust a hot girl by talking about this game.This is the game I've been waiting for since Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights. You are free to do whatever you wish; there are consequences of course so save often! The combat is challenging and intuitive while also managing to be very strategic. I have no idea how they managed to pull it off, but it is seriously perfect. There is plenty to customize and you can set up your characters however you want. They put effort and love into this thing.I think the biggest downside (which some people really like) is the questing system. Yeah it's supposed to be a ""no holding your hand"" style system, but I can never find the single NPC that gave me the quest because they aren't identified anywhere on the map or with anything other than a name that appears if you mouse over them. A bit too much trouble if you ask me, but isn't nearly enough for me to knock the game for it. "

												This is a must buy game for any RPG fan who grew up with the classics like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment. The visuals are above average for a game of this type and the gameplay is even better. I been playing this since the alpha build and the developers stay on top of the updates to keep the game running pretty smooth. The gameplay itself is unlike any rpg I've played before in the way all the character's abilities play off each other for example the Leadership skill bonuses to damage when your in range of your companion/co-op ally to the countless number of the magic abilities that play off each other like fire/water, oil/fire, and water and electricity it is great. The only issue I have with the game is that the developers took out the four player built in co-op because they feared it would be boring which couldn't be futher from the truth. Co-op makes the game even better and being able to have three friends instead of one would of been great. You can use the mods people have made to fix it though so it isn't a huge deal. I highly recommend this game to any person who wants a long and rewarding gameplay experience by yourself or with a friend.			"

												Divinity Original Sin is an excellent title - especially from an indie studio. This is easily the best rpg of this style I have played in over a decade.The community's reviews are spot on for the most part (about the awesomeness of this game), but I just want to point out a few things that I felt the game could improve on:- The game has a steep learning curve (I actually enjoyed this and it was my favorite part about the game). But here was the issue. Once I figured out the learning curve and learned the mechanics, the game suddenly felt too easy and exploitable. Some of the mechanics are far too overpowered once you understand how they interact. In this sense, it was extremely gratifying to get to this point, but once this point of understanding was achieved, I became incredibly bored. Even on the hardest difficulty you can simply ""out-mechanic"" the game by using cheese tactics. Some skills need to be rebalanced.- The inventory system is awkwardly tedious. I won't go in depth but the way the loot is split between your characters and split gold and all that nonsense... it just adds more micromanagement. I understand this is more realistic, but it doesn't add anything interesting and only takes up your time.- This is much more personal opinion I suppose, but I felt like some of the story arcs were far too drawn out. One of the driving factors in a game is the feeling like you are making progress - progress is good. But some of the lengths of the main quests in this game are sooooo long and I started to lose interest. I just wanted to know what happened next, but it took so long to get to it. There's a fine line between creating suspense/interest and the time it requires to build it. If you build it for too long, interest will be lost.Minus the points mentioned above, Divinity OS is a great title, and I highly recommend it.P.S. - As a quick side note, this game does not hold your hand. If you are not willing to spend about 5-7 hours just figuring out the basic mechanics of the game, you will not enjoy this title.8/10			"

												Pretty good RPG. 90% + ratings on metacritic are way overblown however. The game suffers from many bugs and poor design decisions (inventory management, tenebrium skill, overpowered spells). However environments are well designed, and the crafting is reasonably deep (if not terribly useful). The most similar game for comparison is Dragon Age: Origins, which is the superior title. However if you really enjoyed DA:O, this is definitely worth playing.			"

												So, if you are still debating on whether or not to buy this game, debate no more! BUY IT. ITS GOOD. REALLY REALLY GOOD. Let me put this into perspective for all of you little boys and girls. In the game, I own a small, bug-eyed explosive midget skeleton named Thomas. That's freakin right, you heard me. EXPLOSIVE MIDGET SKELETON. If you aren't already sold, I've got another whammy for you. In the game, a friend of mine owns this staff. This staff is no ordinary staff. It talks. Oh... oh what was that? Not good enough for you? OH. I SEE. YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. Alright then... one more. If you have any form of invisibility, you can steal literally anything you want. I have over 100,000 gold worth of stold goods. And, to sweeten the deal, you can sell the stolen things to the people you stole them from. Finally gonna buy the game? GOOD. DO IT. GO.			"

												A marvelous piece of role-based RPGThe Divinity Series had its ups and downs, D:OS is definitly the highest up it ever had. Next to an open-world full of secrets, friends and enemies, there is an excellent gameplay, or as I call it in this case: Open-Gameplay.Why? Because not just you can explore the world just as youself want it and go with quests in your very own style, you can also deal with every enemy, every trap, basically every single step in this world like you want, thanks to the wide and well balanced skill system. It has some troubles at some points, but on that I will go in further in the Divinity: Original SIn Enhanced Edition review, if those difficulties are still existant.But so far: A Must-Have for every RPG fan.

A perfect mixture of challenging combat that scales, intricate puzzles that reward the cautious observer, a deep and involved crafting system, and enough dialogue and branching dialogue paths to remind one of Planescape Torment. I never thought a company would return to this style of RPG, but I'm glad you did. It appears it has really paid off. Bien fait.			"

												While people across the web compare D:OS to games like Baldur's Gate and older TES series, there is a series that does a much better comparison job imo - Ultima!It is common for all old RPGs not to lead a player through with objective markers and scalable content, but Ultima games were unique because of the interactivity.Original Sin does a great job expanding this concept; all the ways player can interact with the world around: move things, break things, create things - affects gaming experience, from immersion to actual combat tactics. The overall game design perfectly complements those interactive mechanics, creating a dense and rich gameplay.An absolute must see for every RPG fan, new or old alike, even if only to understand how far the genre deviated for the last decades and what RPGs used to be about.

The Real RPGI played Divinity: Original Sin long time ago but I realized with the upcoming release of the secund episode that I didn't reviewed the first one. So here I am.First of all, I will not talk about the story except to tell that the lore, the scenario and the (primary and side) quests are very good, you will find quiet and peacefull quests, fighting, enigma... It's very complete and credible.The fighting system is also good, with strategic view, lot of possibilities, many ways to win a fight, at the end, maybe after few loading, you will win but always with difficulty and that is the point of a balanced game.The ""way to play"" is totally up to you depending your character, how you build it, the specialization you took and how you manage your team.About the team, the game can be done with a friends, which is very more enjoyable than playing alone (each players control his own character and a pnj).The graphic is good, some places are very beautiful some are ""good"". I regret that it missed more epicness in the landscapes.Music is more than good, I really appreciated the different themes.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Music: 7/10Story: 9/10 "

												Just to be helpful for wanna be buyers, the short condensed version:Pro's:- Absolutely Baldur's Gate 2014- Looks pretty good- Challenging at first, later on it is rather easy to beat the game (dunno if this is a pro or a con), but then again very few games remain challeging to the last scene- Immersing, good storyline, believeable world- Very atmospheric- Some good irony and humour here and then- Good choice of gear, talents, perks, abilities- Good difference between combat classes and at the same time great choice to mix classes as you see fit- Baldur's Gate that you can play with your sister! (or friend or whoever)Cons:- Some annoying bugs with quests that did not complete due to the order in which I handled things- You basically start in a huge town and spend the first few hours talking endlessly- A lot of the conversations are rather lengthy and only suited for hardcore lore fanatics- All loot is randomized, but some high level areas drop very low level loot (they might fix this)- And my main annoyance: This game is 1/3 about exploring and talking, only 1/3 about combat, and a bloody 1/3 about puzzles, that would take anyone hours to figure out without help of internet. If you like to be challenged by finding a book here and a switch there, then a sacred bone elsewhere hidden in a bush, then this sure will be your thing. Personally I would like a tad more fighting and a bit less wandering about in search for a key.All in all a good game for people that love isometric fantasy games, it delivers what might be expected of the genre. If long ago you enjoyed Baldur's Gate, then this will suit you well.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin was one of the best surprises I've had in gaming in a long while.I've played a couple of Larian Studios' previous games: Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity.  I thought both games were okay, but they weren't so great that they made me a fan of Larian Studios.  So when I bought Divinity: Original Sin last month, thanks to a sale, I didn't have particularly high expectations.  I figured the game would be fun enough to tide me over until PIllars of Eternity came out in late March, 2015.Boy was I wrong.  And I'm glad I was wrong.  D:OS turned out to be one of the very best computer roleplaying games I've ever played.  I think so highly of it for several reasons: It has a tremendous amount of content I did not know how long the first playthrough would take.  I figured I'd get at least 50 hours of gameplay out of it.  I ended up taking 216 hours to complete my first playthrough of the game.  This game was fun and fascinating throughout all of those 216 hours.Before Divinity: Original Sin, I had NEVER spent over 120 hours on a single playthrough of a CRPG.  I'm guessing I completed Planescape: Torment - one of my all-time favorite video games - for the first time in under 100 hours.  Similarly, my first playthroughs of open-world RPGs like Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and Fallout 3 took me about 100 hours or so.  Out of nowhere I wind up buying this RPG from a relatively unknown studio, and I end up being engaged by it longer than most other games I've ever played.I think a majority of gamers who play this game will like the amount of content it has to offer.  It has A LOT.  On top of that, it provides the user enough motivation to play it more than once. Some of the best RPG itemization I've ever seen Managing the itemization of a roleplaying game can be ridiculously challenging.  Take for example Fallout: New Vegas.  I enjoyed F:NV quite a bit.  I've clocked in maybe 300 hours of playtime in New Vegas across multiple (attempted) playthroughs.  One of my few complaints about that game was its itemization.  Specifically, it did not take long for me to acquire what I considered to be optimal gear in any of my playthroughs.  I preferred to play the game as a gunslinger who's friendly with the NCR, so for me the best firearms as well as the best armor were found in the Honest Hearts DLC. Once I completed Honest Hearts, I had the guns and the gear I knew I'd be using for the rest of the game.  Everything else I found was sold so I could accumulate a silly amount of caps that I would not spend on anything.Divinity: Original Sin does not have this problem.  In fact, it has some of the best itemization I've ever seen in an RPG or any other video game.The power of all equippable items in the game are influenced by item rarity (Common, Magical, Rare, Legendary, Unique).  At a certain point in the game, you'll want all of your items to be Legendary or Unique.  Item power is also determined by the level of the item.  So a level 15 Legendary item is going to be more powerful than a level 10 Legendary.Because of the way Larian designed their loot, there is the possibility of finding upgrades all the way until the end of the game.  This made every single combat victory, every single hidden treasure chest, and even every single search-able crate a fun experience, because you never know when or where you'll find the weapon, armor, or magical goodie you'll use to beat the game.I really can't rave enough about the desing of Divinity: Original Sin's loot.  Whenever I engage in a discussion about how itemization can be done right, I will use D:OS as one of my top examples.**Too many good things to say, really**This review has already become much longer than I intended.  The bottom line is that Divinity: Original Sin is an excellent game.  If you like RPGs influenced by classics like Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate, if you like fantasy games, or if you enjoy games that mix humor with quality storytelling, then you'll probably enjoy the hell out of this game.

												Absolutely fantastic, game of the year quite easily for me. Hell, I would say that this is easily the game of the new millenium so far, damn near nothing can even remotely come close to how much fun I have had with this game. It might damn near supplant Baldur's Gate 2 as my favorite game of all time.Ok, I've gushed about it enough but I haven't said a damn thing about the game proper. The gameplay is fantastic, this game encourages exploration out the♥♥♥♥♥ there are secrets and easter eggs everywhere. Combat is satisfying and magic is powerful with many great area denial abilities. The story is cliche, but in a good way in my personal opinion. It really feels like a good old fashioned campaign of D&D with great friends (and that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you'll figure out which companion that guy is.) Dialogue and writing overall is quite good with plenty of humor and it never really takes itself seriously. Character customization is pretty strong, at least in the vein of what your character can do, not appearance so much. DivOS follows a classless system that is flexible enough to allow for multiclassing to become every bit as powerful as specializing is, though the game does stumble in the area of having a few non-combat skills be mostly useless in many situations. Lockpicking for instance can be very useless, since every chest has a key which can be found via exploration or pickpocketing, or by simply bashing/blasting the chest itself open if you so desire. Now as to customising your characters appearance there are limited options, but at the very least it is possible to dye your armors a different color so that you can look a specific way, though it can be difficult to find enough dyes to get your clothes set.When it comes to loot, DivOS went the randomly generated route. Randomly generated loot has some pros and cons, just like hand place loot does. The cons of randomly generated loot is that to many the loot never really feels special and will often be useless for people in the party and in DivOS that can certainly be the case at times. However I also submit that randomly generated loot encourages exploration every bit as much as hand placed loot does. People often cite Morrowind as an excellent example of the glories of hand placed loot, with many otherwise useless caves holding a valuable artifact that rewards you for exploring it. While certainly true, it is really only rewarding the first time around, since you will always know that that item is there so you always know to go there to get it. Morrowind veterans, myself included, know of dozens of place to get powerful artifacts with minimal effort, and while fun it can rapidly become a ritual for the game, which can swing either way of being great or terrible. DivOS on the otherhand opts for a more Diablo-esque loot system, with randomized loot that encourages you to seek chests and fight bosses for the best stuff which I find to be quite enjoyabe as well. Ultimately I enjoy both systems provided they are done well, I just felt it was something you need to know.Graphics are perfectly passable and enjoyable, it is always simple to tell what everything is and the art style of the game is quite good with few standout ridiculous armors or weapons, barring most of the robes unfortunately.

I can go on for a while longer, but for the sake of simply ending this review I'll just say that I can't recommend this game enough, Larian created a true classic with this one.			"

												One of the best RPGs i've played in a long time. When i started playing it i expected it to be Baldur's Gate's spiritual successor, and while that's not really the case it is still a great game in it's own right. And it took me 85 hours to complete one playthrough, that's like... 20 times more than the average game nowdays.The combat system is fenomenal, possibly the best part of the game. Turn-based might sound boring to a lot of people, but if you give it a chance it's surprising how addicting it gets once the battle starts. Think of it like X-COM, but without the clunky movement and horrible RNG. And way more abilities.The main story isn't the game's strongest aspect, and while i wouldn't call it generic i'd say it's quite forgettable. However the world is filled with the usual Larian tongue-in-cheek humor, similar to games like Sacred 2, and many interesting encounters such as talking wells and a romantic sidequest between two cats.The music is great to listen to and doesn't get repetitive. There's a lack of voiced dialogue but this is already taken care of in the Enhanced Edition.My only complaints are the lack of banter between party members and the awful rock-paper-scissors minigame when there are decisions to be made, which works well in co-op but is complete garbage when playing alone.I recommend it to anyone interested in RPGs.

												You know, this game is a touch janky, and it has a steep learning curve, BUT it is ambitious and innovative like no other RPG i've ever met.  Far from perfect, but well worth a play just to see what this kind of game really can offer.  Honestly, it would be really hard to go back to more classic style RPG's (like icewind dale) after this one.  I also heard that the enhanced version fixes most of the jankiness... but the versions are so different that old save games can't be loaded into the new one, sadly...			"

												Including offline time at this point i've put in about 10 hours towards the game. At first I was a little hesitant, as it wasn't what I had expected and it seemed super slow almost to the point of being turned off. But I stuck it out and i'm really glad that I did...Negative first. Foremost I must say that this is truly the only negative thing that I have to say at all. I want more information on character building BEFORE I make my character. I was not originally aware that you must save skill points to further upgrade those skills later - this was a major mistake and i was forced to reset my game so as not to of wasted any skill points nonchalantly. Secondly, I think more emphasis should be put on how important it is to make your party varied in the elemental arts as well as the NEED for a ranged character. So far the best group i've come up with is a mage and a thief/mage (splitting elemental types between them), an archer and a high defense, high constituition knight of sorts. Variety in your skills is MANDO! And make your characters masters of ONE or TWO set of skills. Do not make jack of all trades - it will weaken your part as a whole.COMBAT:The turn based combat delivered on a high level and surpassed the high standards that I had for it. I truly enjoy ALL aspects of combat from ranged skills and melee / rogue type abilities to the more jaw dropping elemental magics that intertwine with the local environment. For example, I electrocuted an Orc Shaman while he was standing in a puddle. It just so happens that his two body guards were standing in the same puddle. BAM! All three instantly damaged and shocked, losing a turn. Not to mention being able to cast water spells near a teammate to do damage to your enemies but put out the flames burning your partners shoulders to a crisp.WORLD:I haven't explored much yet but everything that I've seen so far has been put together very well. From item placement and decorations to broad scale placement of dungeons, changing weather and variety of landscapes.NPCS:I normally skip through that NPC's say in other games. The usual B.S. filler type material that just get irritating - BUT in this game I've become more involved in the storyline and actually enjoy the bickering within the group as well as the diversity in NPC personalities. A lot of effort was put in to making the storyline full with a hint of sassy.SIDE NOTE:I am a bit OCD and a horder in games... and sometimes it ruins games for me because I spend too much time collecting things. Example would be, in Skyrim and Fallout 3. I spent hours upon hours just making sure that 'THIS' chest in my home had only Elvish equipment or Laser weapons. While 'THIS' chest had only Ebony gear or Plasma weapons. I like to seperate things so that I can easily go back and look for things later, plus it becomes a center of pride for myself in game. Odd? Maybe. But this game allows me to feed my sorter desires by giving me back packs and a ""home"" to store my people and valuables. I have backpacks for every different type of item and with the ""pack mule"" talent, its that much easier... I spent 2 out of my 10 hours just organizing and reoganizing. This may not be a selling point for some of you but for those who know what I'm saying... Yup, smile wide. :-D10/10 - So Far.			"

												Understand that this game is its own world. It has its own rules and logic and not all of them are recognizable right away. At first, the game seems hard, and it almost is. It can be punishing to die, and frustrating to get stuck on a puzzle. Ultimately though, because this game is its own world, the reward for uncovering is great. There is so much freedom and independence in this game, it almost feels strange coming from a long line of games that hold your hand to the point it isnt exploration, its a tour. This game is not a guided tour. You’ll need to reload quick saves here and there, and might even lose progress up to 30min of play or more because of a surprise encounter or trap.But! This game is outstanding. All of the above points only help to realize and flesh out the world. The sense of achievement you get when figuring out a difficult puzzle or beating a tough encounter is huge. This game is great, and if you aren't playing it and have a tiny shred of interest, i'd reccomend it without hesitation. I could write a five page point by point on this game and how much it has going for it, but better you experience it. "

Early Access Review
								Divinity:Original Sin feels like the updated child of Baldur's Gate. Design a character from the ground up, choosing skills, feats and spells or opt to take one of the predefined classes. Manage a party of up to four using the slick team controls, or play online multiplayer with each of your friends designing and controlling a character. Conversations with NPCs and between party members are deep and impactful, with each individual being able to act seperately or even adventure seperately if compromise cannot be reached. Combat is turn based, but the Action Point system feels fast and responsive.The very best part of this game however is the extensive modability. I have not seen an editor this well done since Warcraft 3, and already parts of the commuinity are stepping up to make campaigns to rival those of Neverwinter Nights 2. So even if you are on the fence today, I urge you to keep an eye out for what can be done with the engine.			"

												After playing the release version for a good 20 hours and killing every evil thing walking the vicinity of Cyseal, it's time to share my thoughts on Divinity: Original Sin. Most things I said in my EA-review hold true. The game is simply a lot of good, old RPG-fun. It's challenging but not frustrating. It's complex but not confusing, there's a lot to read but that's well written, and there's so much detail and stuff to do and things to find out, I may sink 100 hours into it.To shorten the wait for a decent cRPG I played Baldur's Gate for the first time and Divinity is just as much a joy to play. It's certainly not perfect. There could be much more interaction with your companions and NPCs, the story could be presented better, managing your party inventories is more laborious than it could be, and you can clearly see, Larian was on a tight budget. But none of these things reduce the qualities this game brings - buy it, if you like party-turn-based RPGs!Only one thing battered me when I tought about it: Larian clearly failed to deliver the Kickstarter strechgoals. We knew Day/Night Cycles would not be in the game. It's disappointing but I can live with that. But where's the Lair beneath Phantom Forest, dynamic weather, the orchestral soundtrack and the deep character of the companions? There's not even a way of telling whether they included the other goals since they were formulated in a very abstract way. Don't get me wrong, this won't make Divinity worse in any way, but it leaves a bad taste of broken promise after all. 9/10---I may write a longer review when the game comes out. For now, I can only share my EA-impression. Divinity: Original Sin has improved so much in the last few weeks, especially in terms of usability, that I think it's save to say: It's going to be great. The game grants unparalleled freedom, is fun to play for anyone who likes turn-based RPGs and it looks impressive too. The only thing that annoys me somewhat is the lack of acoustic feedback when interacting with the world, but that's peanuts.If your willing to take the risk of buying a beta that might turn out to be bad - which will not happen imho - than buy it now. Everyone else wait until June 30th. Thank you Larian.			"

												To be honest I have never played a RPG similar to Divinity: Original Sin, I've only played games like Skyrim, Diablo 3 or Dragon age with a real time combat system rather than turn based. So it took me quite some time getting use to the combat system of this game, at first I felt it's too slow but as I progress it actually feels better and better. I love the fact that I can use elemental spells combos against my foes. For example I can cast a rain spell to make puddles on the ground and then I can cast a lighting spell into the puddle and whoever stands on the puddle will be stuned. I also love the fact that the environment is highly interactive in this game, just like in Skyrim where you can pickup and move many different objects, from candles to barrels. The story of the game is great, it starts off with a murder mystery that I have to solve in the first town, which grabs my interest right away, however, I find it sometimes frustrating during the quests since this game does not give you a clear indication where you have to go, unlike the other RPGs I have played. Another thing about this game bothered me a little is the sound. The game only has partial voice acting and sometimes they can be repetitive and annoying, you are reading the conversations in the game for the most of the time. The soundtrack is good but I wish they could have added more tracks. This game takes a lot of time to complete just like some other RPGs I have played, I'm 40 hours into the game and I'm not even close to the end. Overall, I really love this game, it's a fresh experience for me and I am enjoying it very much.Pros:- Cool Combat system- Interesting Story + Side Quests- Beautiful graphicsCons:- Lack of voice/soundtrack variantScore: 8.5/10			"

If you enjoy using you brain in terms of quest completion and combat... Buy this.If you are old enough to remember ultima, baldurs gate, icewind dale etc etc... You will enjoy this this.The ONLY thing I feel is missing are the NPC's having a routine and night/day. If, with their next game, Larian Studios can build on an RPG of this caliber we will have an all time memorable rpg that stays with you for years.			"

												Think about a person. Your closest friend, the one that you trust the most in life; your platonic life-partner. The Bill to your Ted. Starsky to your Hutch. Simon to your Garfunkel. This is the man who you would leave your children to in a sudden passing. The best man of your wedding. The one person in this world that you can rely on moreso than anyone else.If you play Divinity: Original Sin with this person, they are also now officially Hitler.You have created the modern day Hitler. Congratulations. ""But Thalarios, that's an incredibly offensive thing to say.""Well ambigious voice, I'll give it to you that it's a bold claim. But let me tell you why you've resurrected the late Führer from the depths of Hell, and I'll do so in 250 words or less. Divinity: Original Sin is a single and multiplayer fantasy roleplaying game brought to be by the powers of Kickstarter. It puts you and a friend in the world of Rivellon to combat evil magicks and fight goblins and orcs and whatever other fantasy creatures they decide to throw at you. Skeletons probably. But what you didn't realize is that this game was brought to you by M. Night ♥♥♥♥ing Shamaylan because, plot twist, your real enemy is the godfather of your children, Hitler.Are you going to play a melee hero? Your friend will obviously play a ranged hero, of course. And if you go ranged, they'll go melee. ""To balance out the party"" they'll say. ""It'll be more fun this way."" And you'll agree to this, because you are innocent to their true nature. I guess you never took Social Studies. Maybe you were too busy getting handies behind the football stadium from Victoria Blangfield.And in the first couple fights, you'll laugh with him and say ""Wow this turn-based combat is interesting! Did you see that explosive barrel you shot did damage to me?""""Yeah."" He'll say. ""Yeah ain't that something.""""We better be careful about that stuff!"" You'll trail off, too busy taking in the ambience of the game.He won't reply. You'll fight a few more encounters, and you'll laugh nervously as you get caught in his charges, or as his flame arrows ignite the ground you walk upon. Maybe he's just learning. I mean you're only level 1. Flash forward.You're level 5, enclosed by skeletons on every side. The claps of thunder above are the only thing that keep you awake through the pain and constant downpour of rain. But you know with your next turn you can finish the skeletons off. One mighty bladestorm is all it'll take.You look at the iniative at the top of the screen.Hitler is next.""Hey man, hold your action until after I use my bladestorm. You can pick off any that are left,"" you pause for a laugh, ""If there are any!""There's a moment of silence before he speaks.""I'm going to use my electric arrow to crowd control them all."" he says.""What? No, don't do it man."" You're unsure if he's joking or not. ""You're gonna CC me! It's raining, the electric will CC me!"" He doesn't say anything. You see his character charging up the shot.""Come on man just let me do it!"" You're reduced to pleading now. Pathetic, shameless pleading.  ""We'll just finish this fight and then we can save so I can go grab those tickets to see Maroon 5 before they're sold out. The show's gonna be so sick bro!"" Too bad Adam Levine was born after World War 2. He let's the electric arrow loose. Every single skeleton resists his stun. It's your turn now. Oh wait, Hitler just crowd controlled you. The skeletons beat on you until nothing's left but a bloodied pile of armor and regret. It's Hitler's turn. Oh look, another electric arrow. You haven't said a word since his last turn. Stun fails again. He dies to the skeletons. Fade to black. Reload screen. Silence. ""I'll catch you later man, gonna hit the sack. Same time tomorrow?"" he says and before you can answer he logs out.You drive 45 minutes to get the tickets. They're sold out.  "

This is wonderful, with great writing, fun turn by turn combat (which I normally hate) and a lot of questing which takes a fair amount of puzzle solving. It is also difficult and leveling isn't fast which I appreciate. I want things to be a bit of a challenge. Overall, one of the best games I've played in recent years.			"

												I haven’t gotten super far into it so I can’t speak for the narrative as a whole, but the line-writing is very good.The actual gameplay I think is fantastic… combat presents you with a great variety of tactical options, and you can get really creative with spell combos. It’s turn-based, which has the downside of leaving me bored while I wait for enemies to act but the upside of giving me time to really think and plan.There’s a multiplayer conversation system (which you can play both sides of if you’re playing a SP game, or assign the second protagonist an AI personality to automatically choose their own lines) which is even better than SWTOR’s because it actually takes into account whether the protagonists agree or disagree with one another; my only criticism is the rock-paper-scissors method of decision resolution if you disagree (it’s also used as the persuasion minigame when trying to convince NPCs). It’s affected by your proficiency with different persuasion styles, but it’s still a little game-y. That said, I don’t know how I would improve it.So, very strong first impression. I’d have more to say if I’d completed it.			"

												Well ive had the game since early access and only played alittle since the final version went live you can see alot of improvement and polish to the game. If you enjoy old skool RPGS like Baldars Gate, Planescape Incewind Dale and Ultima series you will love this as it has the same feel as some of them classic games when they first came out. The sound tracks amazing and i can say ive had no issues running it well  worth buying great game lots of fun.			"

								Not played a great deal of this game yet as waiting for my friend to also play some Coop rather then solo, but what I have played so far I have enjoyed, you can definietly tell its still early so if you can't put up with the rough edges then it might be worth you holding off, but if you are like me and want to play it regardless of its state then I'd say its worth a buy.

												Brilliant cRPG, highly recommend it. Larian have done a terrific job bringing old school RPG into 2014 without compromising or dumbing it down. Pretty much everything you know and love about cRPG is there. Complex character stats, inventory management, wall of texts and no quest marker.Combat is all turned based, using the action point system. What makes it interesting is the area effect and how the different element interact with each other. Cast a spell to make it rain and enemies become more susceptible to stuns (electricity) or frozen. Drop poison gas or oil and follow it up with a fireball and the gas/oil blows up causing more damage to the affected area. It's going to suck now playing other RPGs and not being able to remove or use hazards to your advantage.Game was made to be played co-op but if you want to just play it single-player (I did), it'll pretty much play just like any other RPG except you'll have an option to roleplay both characters. A recent patch added personalilties that you can set on your 2 main characters which will let the AI control the other main character you aren't controling in conversation should you want to automate either character's responses. The story is probably the only real weakness of the game. It's pretty generic fantasy stuff (with a humorous undertone, especially on side quests), but it did keep me engaged enough for the 85 or so hours it took me to finish the game with all side quests done (great btw). The puzzles are, in most cases done pretty well. Some of them might not be obvious right away. You'll have to look around your environment, reading books or talking to the right person for clues. There was 1 or 2 that was convoluted, which lead to trial and error. The game isn't perfect but I did not run into any game breaking bugs and Larian is constantly updating the game on a regular basis. There's a free toolset that comes with the game so hopefully, we'll be seeing quality user generated content that will keep the game alive for hours after finishing the campaign. We've got 3 more cRPGs coming out (Wasteland 2, Torment and Pillars of Eternity), Larian was the first out of the gate and it has set a pretty high bar for the rest to follow. "

												To be honest I have never played a RPG similar to Divinity: Original Sin, I've only played games like Skyrim, Diablo 3 or Dragon age with a real time combat system rather than turn based. So it took me quite some time getting use to the combat system of this game, at first I felt it's too slow but as I progress it actually feels better and better. I love the fact that I can use elemental spells combos against my foes. For example I can cast a rain spell to make puddles on the ground and then I can cast a lighting spell into the puddle and whoever stands on the puddle will be stuned. I also love the fact that the environment is highly interactive in this game, just like in Skyrim where you can pickup and move many different objects, from candles to barrels. The story of the game is great, it starts off with a murder mystery that I have to solve in the first town, which grabs my interest right away, however, I find it sometimes frustrating during the quests since this game does not give you a clear indication where you have to go, unlike the other RPGs I have played. Another thing about this game bothered me a little is the sound. The game only has partial voice acting and sometimes they can be repetitive and annoying, you are reading the conversations in the game for the most of the time. The soundtrack is good but I wish they could have added more tracks. This game takes a lot of time to complete just like some other RPGs I have played, I'm 40 hours into the game and I'm not even close to the end. Overall, I really love this game, it's a fresh experience for me and I am enjoying it very much.Pros:- Cool Combat system- Interesting Story + Side Quests- Beautiful graphicsCons:- Lack of voice/soundtrack variantScore: 8.5/10			"

												I found a needle in a haystack, hired a guy named 'Explodo the magnificent' and made him wear a pumpkin as a helmet..I got beaten to death for accidentally stealing some guys apple.I killed the mayors adopted orc daughter while he was downstairs, went down and he didnt find out for 2 days. He didn't suspect it was me. I killed some guys orc girlfriend because I hate orcs. He was upset. I dug up the body of a dead orc while his greiving brother watched, then killed him too. I hate orcs.My main dude is an afro-sporting black bodybuilder named black dynamite who kicks major♥♥♥♥♥I've played this game for 15 hours and only really just started exploring outside of the first town.I've had everyone in my party die without killing anybody, only to reload and kill everybody without casualty. Its very strategy intensive.Good game, recommended!			"

												Understand that this game is its own world. It has its own rules and logic and not all of them are recognizable right away. At first, the game seems hard, and it almost is. It can be punishing to die, and frustrating to get stuck on a puzzle. Ultimately though, because this game is its own world, the reward for uncovering is great. There is so much freedom and independence in this game, it almost feels strange coming from a long line of games that hold your hand to the point it isnt exploration, its a tour. This game is not a guided tour. You’ll need to reload quick saves here and there, and might even lose progress up to 30min of play or more because of a surprise encounter or trap.But! This game is outstanding. All of the above points only help to realize and flesh out the world. The sense of achievement you get when figuring out a difficult puzzle or beating a tough encounter is huge. This game is great, and if you aren't playing it and have a tiny shred of interest, i'd reccomend it without hesitation. I could write a five page point by point on this game and how much it has going for it, but better you experience it. "

												Pretty close to my ideal game. Similar to Temple of Elemental Evil but not burdened by a PnP mechanic system nor the desire to recreate a PnP module. Single player alone would be amazing, but the multiplayer through the campaign is fully supported and essentially plays out like all the good parts of a PnP session (down to internal party conflicts, if minimally) with all the benefits of being a CRPG. The combat system is incredibly deep but follows consistent rules and heavily rewards clever tactics, with huge emphasis on proper positioning and use of environment.The game is also quite challenging, giving a reason to need good tactics. Crowd control is brutal, you will almost always be outnumbered and your enemies are not afraid to lock your party down if you mess up. A number of special encounters also introduce little gimmicks, ensuring major fights don't get completely repetitive.On top of that, the game is fairly freeform within the constraints of a linear plot. Most side quests have alternative resolutions that can impact how other missions play out. The quests themselves are handled as journal entries rather than specific tasks and rewards exploration and proactive investigation. The only real issues are that the very end game feels a bit rushed (that said, this is after 50+ hours of very high production quality campaign) and, arguably, balance issues (due to the emphasis on battlefield control, ranged and caster characters are extremely strong in comparison to melee). However, the balance is debatable and on the whole a lot more enjoyable due to the high differentation in the skillsets compared to a very tightly tuned skillset, and the ability of any character to essentially multiclass freely gives you lots of options if something isn't working out.

												This past fall, my wife and I wanted to start a new hobby together. We settled on the idea of getting into table top RPG's, and so we picked up Pathfinder. Immediately we fell in love with the roleplaying, the freedom, the stories, combat, and so on and so forth. There was a major downside to our new found love. Those with whom we shared our time with where ""unique"". Personally, I had nothing more against these individuals, other than I wish they utilized proper hygiene and did not emit the foul stench of cat urine. We stopped playing, but the itch for roleplaying continued, until I discovered this diamond of a game that Larian has produced. Just looking at the quality of work while this was in alpha was enough to make me salivate. This game has a very special way of letting the player(s) go about tackling quests. You choose how you want to go about solving quests, and in many cases, I have found that I have never solved many of the quests the same way twice. The character creation is very thorough and in depth, where you choose your initial class. However, once you have chosen that class, if you point points into other talents and abilities you can create and customize a character that is specific to your interests. Larian has stated that they wanted to create an atmosphere that is reminiscent of table top RPG's, and I think that they have surpassed that goal. As of yet, I cannot say what it is like to play this game solo, due to fact that I am playing with my wife, however I would imagine it would still be enjoyable, but I highly recommend playing it with someone else if you have the ability to do so. Lastly the price. The direction and vision Larian has for their new game is set to have no limit, whether content is created by them or modders. The price then seems almost too good to be true. With the attention that few other companies give to their games post launch, I feel Larian very deserving of my money, time, and attention. They have put out minor fixes everyday for since the game has launched. While we have not had any issues, other players may have, and for a company to listen so intently to the concerns of their customers as to put out hotfixes each day is almost unheard of anymore. $40 is a steal for how much I have been enjoying this game, it has been my guilty pleasure as a therapist to come home after a long day of helping others with their problems, and play for 4-6 hours with my sweetheart. It is truly an experience that I hope to continue as we become more involved and delve deeper into the depths of dungeons, becoming more involved in the world around us, and lastly enjoying every second of the problem solving. If you are still on the fence about this game, give it a chance. Even if you do not like, consider the money spent as a donation to a studio very deserving of the positive recognition for this game. I cannot speak for their past works, but I will be paying attention to what they do in the future.			"

												Brilliant RPG for the fans of ""think to win"", not ""press x to win""(like DAO or ME). At hard difficulty it is really hard and challenging. You should use crafted scrolls\arrows\potions\food or you won't win and this is good because not much RPGs(at least modern ones) forcing you to make some preparations before the fight. Nice storyline and side quests, not perfect, but good enough to entertain you between battles and looting\stealing\crafting. Again, no quest markers on the map and THANK YOU FOR THAT. First time for a long time i'm not feeling myself a brainless idiot who just runs from one quest mark to another via waypoints because lots of rpg developers this days seems to thinking that average player cannot read the quest dialog and find the right way himself.And thank you for co-op mode. If you have a friend who's ready to spare with you lots of hours while adventuring in fantasy world, then it's a must buy for you.			"

												In summary: the perfect entrypoint for someone who wants to get into old-school, DnD style RPGs; especially late-to-the-party generation kids who enjoy the RPG genre. It's not Game of Thrones, but I'm very happy with the idea of a game that can introduce me to the type of storytelling that doesn't patronize me with the instant gratification of the all too obvious maps, dialogue and waypoints combination we've become accustomed to in contemporary RPGs.I feel like I missed the generation of DnD, Fallout 1/2, and Baldur's Gate; growing up on what I'd call almost mindless RPGs like Oblivion, Mass Effect, Dragon Age and Skyrim. Games that are incredibly fun, but require very little effort or attention to detail to complete; games that certainly show the hallmarks of an RPG, but lack the complete-formula and romance of the classic pen and paper dungeon crawler.This game is a step in the right direction, and I look forward to giving Baldur's Gate another try after I've played through this 3 times or more.

												So where to start. Let's start with the end. Do I recommend Divinity: Original Sin? Absolutely. The game is absolutely magnificent and here is why:It has been so long since I have played either a pen and paper rollplaying game or something like Baldur's Gate that I had forgotten how entertaining both used to be. Divinity: Original Sin is a throw back to those good'ol days. D:OS is very different from most of its contemporary peers, because it simply lets you play the way you want to play. No handholding. That means you'll be forced to ""think"". It is shocking at first, when you realise there are no quest markers and you are left to your own devices and you find yourself in front of a locked door. But then you discover that there is no predetermined way of breaching said door. You can talk to the NPC the door belongs to and he may give you the key. You can sneak in and steal the key, while your partner is distracting the NPC. You can kill the NPC and grab the key. IF the door is made out of wood, you can take an axe to it; or burn it down; or you may have a ""magical unlock"" skill and unlock the door without the key; or you if you don't have the magical skill, you can craft paper, out of wood and us a magical pen you have crafted to create a magical unlock scroll; or perhaps you have the ""petpal"" skill and talk to a rat that then shows you a back door; or maybe the door is not made out of wood and just iron bars and you can look into the room, then you can just teleport into it if you have the skill, or if you don't you can craft a scroll with the skill on it. I think you get the idea.  The amount of freedom and choices is simply staggering. Because of this it is best to enjoy this game with a friend. Someone you talk to on teamspeak so you can run ideas past each other. The game truly shines in 2-player COOP, provided you know the other person and communicate via audio. Don't bother with finding a random player through the lobby. While that is certainly possible as there are a looooot of people playing right now, I think your experience will be highly diminished. The combat is fun. The magical elements behave ""realistically"", i.e Magicka on steroids. For example: You freeze some enemies with an ice wall. That leaves ice patches on the ground that you and the enemies can slip on. Someone shoots a fireball at it. The ice melts and leaves a puddle of water. You can then shoot lightning at the puddle and the water and everyone that touches the puddle get electrocuted and stunned. Shoot another fireball and the electrified puddle evaporates into an electrified cloud. Amazing fun.Finally, the story is actually pretty entertaining. The dialog doesn't take itself too seriously and at times is just flatout hilarious. And when you finish the game it feels like you have been partaking on a long epic journey. If you are like me and like to discover every inch of an open-world game then you'll be surprised by the size of the game world. My first play through took roughly 120 hours. Though I did start over after the first 10 hours, because I realized my skill choices where not complementing each other well. So that leaves me with around 110 hours for the first playthrough. Not bad for the price. And there still remains enough to be discovered so that a second playthrough is appealing to me.If you like old school pen and paper or cRPGs like Baldur's Gate / Arcanum you will most likely love this game. If you expect to be guided through the game or expect something like Diablo 3 then you best stay way.			"

												Brilliant RPG for the fans of ""think to win"", not ""press x to win""(like DAO or ME). At hard difficulty it is really hard and challenging. You should use crafted scrolls\arrows\potions\food or you won't win and this is good because not much RPGs(at least modern ones) forcing you to make some preparations before the fight. Nice storyline and side quests, not perfect, but good enough to entertain you between battles and looting\stealing\crafting. Again, no quest markers on the map and THANK YOU FOR THAT. First time for a long time i'm not feeling myself a brainless idiot who just runs from one quest mark to another via waypoints because lots of rpg developers this days seems to thinking that average player cannot read the quest dialog and find the right way himself.And thank you for co-op mode. If you have a friend who's ready to spare with you lots of hours while adventuring in fantasy world, then it's a must buy for you.			"

I love everything about this game from the crafting, art style and game design choice.   The class balance does seem a bit off but it's forgivable in context of everything else.Highly recommend picking this up.			"

												Haven't finished it but I'm over 70 hours in so I think I can write a fair review.I was worried I'd be bad at this game but it was getting such great reviews I decided to buy it on sale.  Happy that I did.You're eased into the game at the start, although the number of skills you have at your disposal is a little daunting.  After the initial intro however, you're on your own.  A lot of things are there for you to discover as you play the game.  This makes it a bit harder but it's done in a way that is fun.  And there's lots of that to be had.The graphics in these well imagined environments are gorgeous, but you do need a hefty system for them.  I tried it with both 4 and then 8 gigs of RAM.  There's an enormous difference in performance despite my video card (770 GTX).  Story is very intriguing, but the game shines I think most in gameplay.  The number of skills/spells you can have is staggering and almost seems unfair to the enemies you'll face.  This is not a linear game, however I will say you'll be limited at times as to where you can go due to enemy level difference, which you can sometimes circumvent.  As an example I snuck through a whole canyon of higher level orcs and goblins to access a mine with my rogue, then teleported the rest of the party inside to continue.  This can be problematic however if you can't find enemies you can level up on.This is a LONG game, and you can really tell that they put effort in refining it.  There are a lot of events that had me laughing out loud too; the developers have quite a sense of humor.If you're a fan of the genre I wouldn't pass it up.			"

												Loving this game. It really takes me back to the original Divine Divinity which was one of my favorite old school RPG games. This is wonderful, with great writing, fun turn by turn combat (which I normally hate) and a lot of questing which takes a fair amount of puzzle solving. It is also difficult and leveling isn't fast which I appreciate. I want things to be a bit of a challenge. Overall, one of the best games I've played in recent years.			"

												I haven’t gotten super far into it so I can’t speak for the narrative as a whole, but the line-writing is very good.The actual gameplay I think is fantastic… combat presents you with a great variety of tactical options, and you can get really creative with spell combos. It’s turn-based, which has the downside of leaving me bored while I wait for enemies to act but the upside of giving me time to really think and plan.There’s a multiplayer conversation system (which you can play both sides of if you’re playing a SP game, or assign the second protagonist an AI personality to automatically choose their own lines) which is even better than SWTOR’s because it actually takes into account whether the protagonists agree or disagree with one another; my only criticism is the rock-paper-scissors method of decision resolution if you disagree (it’s also used as the persuasion minigame when trying to convince NPCs). It’s affected by your proficiency with different persuasion styles, but it’s still a little game-y. That said, I don’t know how I would improve it.So, very strong first impression. I’d have more to say if I’d completed it.			"

If you enjoy old skool RPGS like Baldars Gate, Planescape Incewind Dale and Ultima series you will love this as it has the same feel as some of them classic games when they first came out.

												Divinity: Original Sin is turn-based rpg with most important feature in my opinion multiplayer the game up to 4 players. And it's not pvp or some multiplayer scenario, it's the actual game played in multiplayer. It works, and it's really fun.Game contains lots of dialogue and interactive combat. Combat is turn-based and environment matters. If it's raining, burning effects wont stay, and if there's ice on the ground, you can slip on it. Things like that make the game more tactical and can sometimes create really unfair, but often fun results.Story is affected by the choices player(s) make, to some extent. You can deal with encounters in plenty of different ways, for example peacefully negotiate, or straight up murder everyone. Literally. You can kill almost everyone in the game if you want, town npc's and such.You can develop your character in many ways. Be either a melee warrior, stealthy rogue, mage out of many different spell schools or ranger. You're also free to combine these stereotypes and play hybrid class.It's great, fun game with tongue-in-cheek attitude. I wholeheartedly recommend the game to anyone wanting a turn-based rpg action.----------------------Then, my personal negative sides of the game:My personal negative side of the game is that combat-wise pure damage is way stronger than any kind of tanking. While this is true in most rpg games in general, it still saddens me that there's great possibilities for some kind of tanking setup but it's much harder to play, or rather pure damage dealer party is so much more stronger that it's bit silly.Another negativity is that stealing is way too easy. So easy that it becomes second nature to just steal everything even bit valuable, and that can break the game more or less. At least I felt that I became bit too overpowered because I could just steal everything, sell, buy things like bonus skill point books. If you get caught while stealing, you can get attacked and so on, but it's very easy to avoid that happening. Stealing doesn't affect morality of the characters in any way besides one dialogue option between the players, and even then you can say that stealing is wrong and steal stuff anyway.Besides these two things, the game is exceptionally good and wholeheartedly recommended!

												Like all good CPRGs, expect to enjoy hours and hours fighting and exploring and thinking (20+ hours not shown). D:OS can be compared to other classic CRPGs, such as Balder's Gate 2 & Fallout 2, and hold its head high. i.e. It is a topdown isometric squad(?) RPG real-time then turn-based in combat. Similar to the Fallout series in that you can roam and explore and do as you like - until you get to dungeon-like instances. There will be some hard puzzle solving.The Elemental Magic system is something the old school CRPGs dream of. eg. Water + Cold = freezing (with all the 3D animations for it). However, after you slip 3 times in a row on the same puddle of icey water (left over from the battle), you do get frustrated (until you hit level 10 and get the tornado spell). In D:OS you have everything you would expect from a CRPG - stealing from NPCs, bartering, lock picking, quicksave-scumming on traps. >.> Also like old school CRPGs, the battles will seem very hard until you understand the strategy - especially for the boss fights. Pro Tip: items and gold is common, XP is a limited commodity.The dialogue is funny, quirky and numerous. Character ratings (like-ability) unfortunately has no real consequence. The dialogue is also competitive when deciding which AI or Human character is the winner of the dialogue options. This is done with Rock-Paper-Scissors with skills influencing points won. It makes perfect sense for a RPG with skill-checks, especially with multiplayer. FWIW - co-op is absolutely awesome (but it is difficult to find a friend I know who plays CRPGs, sigh).The Unity engine is a mixed blessing. There is a an editor (creating levels and whatever), ""mod-ability"" is very high. Graphics are good but nothing amazing. D:OS could have been a 10/10 game if released on a custom CRPG engine top graphics. There are still a few bugs in game but nothing game breaking (I expect they will all be fixed within a month or two of this review). I backed D:OS on Kickstarter and played the beta as well. You are not missing out on anything if you get the DLC - except for a discount. Highly recommend.			"

This is not a successor of that game and it wasn't even on their plans either! This company is Larian not BioWare, so that comparison doesn't even make sense! If you want a baldurs gate 3 then complain to bioware...The writing, the quests, how can you equip or use almost any items for something, pick-move-destroy almost everything, kill almost anyone, the open game (yes you can go anywhere but high level enemies will kill you in a second but it was like that even on divine divinity!)The combat is very good, it is turn based, no more hack and slash which is a very good thing, you need to think on how to approach it not just lure the enemies one by one with a bow and then kill them.Save anywhere system!The music is awesome as always! (kudos to Mr Kirill Pokrovsky)The graphics are now full 3d and they are very good, I'm one of those person who still prefer 2d pre-render backgrounds like divine divinity but still the graphics are awesome.Many puzzles to solve, nice dialogs with a good plot too, and there is even voice acting for the main characters and some npc.Lots of skills and spells to use, a true rpg to discover :)So overall this game is fantastic maybe you will want to wait a little bit more before playing it because it's still a little buggy but they are patching the game very often but dont get me wrong, right now the game is playable, very much playable, it's not like a beta version if that's what you are thinking or someone said on the forum but like a I said little things here and there, but then again it's a big game with a lot of stuffs so it is to be expected.All in all a 9/10 game.

			Divinity Original Sin: Quick Look Divinity Original Sin takes the old days of PC turn based RPGs and modernize it with a slick and high gloss presentation.		

Divinity takes PC turn based RPGs and modernize it with the shimmer and shine of today's graphical standards. Though the game looks fantastic, I would even go as far as saying one of the best in the genre, the core and mechanics stay true to it's source. The game is deep and will require dozens if not hundreds of hours from the player. If you are looking for a time sink, this one will do you just fine. The writing and story are equally as impressive as it's visuals. Characters are lively with humor and personality, and the narrative will draw you in with it's many incentives to role play. Since the game is so large in scope, I found it to be slow at the start. Not just pacing, but also in understanding. It took me a few re-rolls before I made a game that I was happy with, and even then it took me roughly 3-4 hours before I moved away from the dialog heavy town, and into the more actiony bits. Of course my persistent demand to talk to every single towns folk before leaving may have contributed to more time than needed, and only serve as testimony in how engrossing the writing can be. Also keep in mind, you need to be able to enjoy reading... a lot. There is only limited voice acting and the majority of the game is told in written form.Overall, the game is every thing I expected and more. It will probably go down as one of the great classics of our time.Pros:- Excellent visuals and overall presentation- Deep mechanics- HUGE game- Lots of customization- Great writing- Classic return to form, for this style of RPGCons:- Slow to start (potentially).- Could prove too daunting for those who are short on free time.

												Divinity: Original Sin is a Balder's Gate-esque roleplaying game where you are sent to uncover a mysterious killer in the town of Cyseal, but what you find has consequences which affect the entire world.Divinity is a fantastic game. Absolutely amazing. It has been #1 on Steam since it's launch for a reason: it's incredibly good.I spent 90 hours fully completing the game, and enjoyed it all.Divinity is a roleplaying game in the truest sense. When you talk to someone, or learn a new bit of info, it gets added to your journal, but that's it. There's no quest objectives, no drive, it's up to you and you alone to figure out what to do. You wanna investigate the scene of a murder, okay, what do you do? Really, think about it, what's your first move? Then, you do it in-game!There's no hand-holding, no hints or tips, it's pure logic and it's incredibly enjoyable and satisfying. There are some bugs, but Larian have been releasing patches almost twice a week fixing the little odds and ends which cause issue. Throughout the entire 90 hours of play, I encountered only 1 bug I would consider ""annoying"", so I think that says a lot.Pick up this title if you like the sound of it. I must add the gameplay is fun and easy, the turnbased system. The story is engaging and interesting, with some great and coherent voice acting throughout, and the game just looks fantastic from the get go. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. So far, this is my Game of the Year for 2014. Nilesy			"

This is going to take up most of my time and I can see that I will get frustrated a lot, but it will be a very good frustration.  Already found someone to team up with and love the fact that you can join in/skip conversations anytime you want, as long as your close to the other player.  A lot of reading is needed in game and, I guess, out of game to fully understand the whole game.  Not a game that you can just pick up and go.8/10  It may go up or down as I progress.			"

Also keep in mind, you need to be able to enjoy reading... a lot. There is only limited voice acting and the majority of the game is told in written form.Overall, the game is every thing I expected and more. It will probably go down as one of the great classics of our time.Pros:- Excellent visuals and overall presentation- Deep mechanics- HUGE game- Lots of customization- Great writing- Classic return to form, for this style of RPGCons:- Slow to start (potentially).- Could prove too daunting for those who are short on free time.

												Divinity: Original Sin is a Balder's Gate-esque roleplaying game where you are sent to uncover a mysterious killer in the town of Cyseal, but what you find has consequences which affect the entire world.Divinity is a fantastic game. Absolutely amazing. It has been #1 on Steam since it's launch for a reason: it's incredibly good.I spent 90 hours fully completing the game, and enjoyed it all.Divinity is a roleplaying game in the truest sense. When you talk to someone, or learn a new bit of info, it gets added to your journal, but that's it. There's no quest objectives, no drive, it's up to you and you alone to figure out what to do. You wanna investigate the scene of a murder, okay, what do you do? Really, think about it, what's your first move? Then, you do it in-game!There's no hand-holding, no hints or tips, it's pure logic and it's incredibly enjoyable and satisfying. There are some bugs, but Larian have been releasing patches almost twice a week fixing the little odds and ends which cause issue. Throughout the entire 90 hours of play, I encountered only 1 bug I would consider ""annoying"", so I think that says a lot.Pick up this title if you like the sound of it. I must add the gameplay is fun and easy, the turnbased system. The story is engaging and interesting, with some great and coherent voice acting throughout, and the game just looks fantastic from the get go. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. So far, this is my Game of the Year for 2014. Nilesy			"

Early Access Review
								TL:DR; You can surprise a lady having a bath and get yelled at. 11/10 will play for years.I really wish other Early Access Games would be released with this much solid basic content to let you really feel like you have something to test that gives you an idea of what their end goal is. Larian has done it right. Yes there are some bugs and things that still need perfecting in the mechanics, but this is ALPHA and its purpose is for players to find those bugs and report them for fixing. The Alpha gives you the first town an some surrounding area to explore and do a few quests in, but it's a pretty HUGE area with a lot of content and even a couple of little easter eggs that give you a good insight into what the rest of the game will be like to play through. There's plenty of combat encounters with nasty things for you to play around with the turn based combat mechanics and leveling your characters. It's not an Alpha you'll burn through in an hour! I played for around 15 hours and still didn't finish everything or go everywhere. Hell, the recently released Might & Magic X is at final release only about a 25 hour game for the same price... And frankly I'm pretty angry I bought the Alpha for that one at this point considering how limp the final release is.D:OS is for fans of Larian like myself, a long-anticipated game from a game developer with a history of quirky but addicting games and dedication to their playerbase. Divine Divinity (their first in this series) came out in 2002 and I bought it for myself for xmas that year and was instantly hooked. I had played Diablo so much I had actually worn out a couple of game CD's of it, but there'd been nothing since 1996 which had caught me quite the same till DivDiv came out, and I can honestly say if I put 500+ hours into Diablo, I must have over the years put 1000+ into DivDiv and have bought many copies of the game. I am actually working on another playthrough to keep myself occupied till D:OS comes out lol It's still to this day my favourite game.Larian's creative, fresh and cheeky style never grows old and has a great balance of a light hearted comedic RPG with some silly elements, but also a very deep and complex serious story with a vast world of politics and lore beneath it. The NPC's are lively and memorable, your own character conversation choices are full of personality and ""life"". I was very pleasently reminded of DivDiv when I played Dragon Age, it felt like they took a few pages out of Larian's book on crafting engaging conversation with humor and depth without losing the serious story side. And so far D:OS looks like it's solidly in the tradition, style & quality I would expect. If you like things like Douglas Adams, Monty Python and a little Tolkein & Game of Thrones mixed in, you will probably enjoy this game.Although there is a story which you're playing through, and technically you're on a rail to get to the end of it, you almost never feel like you are. You have great freedom to go where you want and kill who you want as well (which CAN screw you up, as you can kill people who are key to completing a quest! But that's your fault, you psychopath). If D:OS is like DivDiv then you will have dozens and dozens of side quests and places to explore which will keep you busy and add replay value as well. It's a little early to judge on that for sure, but Larian has been consistent in giving a lot of content in side quests in all of their other games so I feel like it's a fairly safe bet to be able to look forward to that.The look and animation in the game is very pretty, the lighting is fantastic as well, I love using fireballs because they just look incredible and you can really see the blistering heat from them. So this is certainly a game which is very pleasing on the eyes. It's consistent with the look and feel of their previous games as well, so it still feels like you're in Rivellon!Movement is the biggest flaw that really stuck out to me during my playing so far. It's a bit clunky feeling right now and like your team is a little slow to respond when you give them a direction to move in and their progress when they do get going is a bit plodding especially when you want to run across a large section of the map. That can get pretty time consuming and the pathing for your party members when they're following you when you've selected a direction to run in can be a bit problematic, considering how slow the movement is it's surprisingly easy to loose one or two of them while you're travelling. I'll be reporting the movement issues - I'll be honest and say it isn't enough to stop me playing even if that doesn't change for final release, but it is frustrating and I can totally see it stopping others from playing. I really haven't seen much else that stands out to me as a flaw worth mentioning in a review of an Alpha stage release, yes there are a few bugs, but I'm sure they will be fixed if reported. With the exception of Starbound I haven't been this thrilled with my player experience with a game I backed in Alpha release. And I wouldn't hesitate to recommend D:OS to anyone with a sense of humor who likes turn-based RPGs and vast world/lore exploration. "

												Spent the first two hours clicking on just about every object I could see.  Then finally got to a town and, oh boy, just about every npc has something to say.  This is going to take up most of my time and I can see that I will get frustrated a lot, but it will be a very good frustration.  Already found someone to team up with and love the fact that you can join in/skip conversations anytime you want, as long as your close to the other player.  A lot of reading is needed in game and, I guess, out of game to fully understand the whole game.  Not a game that you can just pick up and go.8/10  It may go up or down as I progress.			"

Early Access Review
								I would highly recommend this game to any big RPG fans, especially those that like games of older generations such as Planetscape Torment, Baldurs Gate and Dungeon and Dragons. There's very high amount of customization and replayability as the game is very fluid and many of the parts can be done with different methods yielding different results. While I've only played the beta, I'd be shocked if the review would change at all - and I already consider this game as one of the best RPG's I've played which combines a great story along with great gameplay and freedom, yet still allows for 2 friends to have fun and has plenty of laugh out loud moments. I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan. Story: 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Control: 9/10AI: 8/10Graphics: 9/10Sound: 10/10 Overall: 9.5/10 (one of the best games I've ever played)			"

Early Access Review
								My first memorable Top Down RPG was probably the Fallout series and in many ways it's left a lasting impression on what i like in my RPG's.  I absolutely fall in love with rich worlds, well crafted lore, unique NPCs, and a certain amount of freedom with character creation (both in gameplay and personality).  While their have been many pretenders to the throne to this old school theory of game development and the general meta-game has shifted toward action based RPG's Larian Studios has restored my faith with Divinity Original Sin.I've been playing through the comabt and avoiding the story as much as possible but what accidental bits i've discovered and the combat has me very excited for the full release.  To say i've bought into the hype is a bit of an understatement.  I'm actively drinking the kool-aid at this point.This is going to be one of those games you wake up on the weekend and make yourself a cup of coffee while playing co-op with one of your old gaming friends.  There will be pauses between dialogue choices as you decided how you want to respond and several minute long planning sessions on how to engage a tough fight (see the 4 elemental demon bosses early on.  We fought them at lvl 4 and won but it did take a little bit of planning).I'll give a more solid review when the game is fully released as i've been reading that launch has been delayed for voice acting (MOTHER OF GOD, YES!) and the same company and actors from dragon commander are doing the voices.  For the uninformed, Dragon Commander has some very solid voice acting and helped sell the world and general atmosphere of the game.  I have complete faith that a return of the actors from Dragon Commander will be an incredible experience ontop of something i'm already looking forward to.  (i also have a schoolyard crush on the actress that did Ophelia's voice in Dragon Commander, Here's hoping she does voices for Original Sin too)But my general reccomendation is to buy this game.  If you're a twitch gaming kind of guy then save your money for something more to your taste but if you like RPG's, stategy games, Pen/Paper DND, tactical turn-based combat, and any variations of those core game elements then this game is absolutely for you.

												This game can be very difficult at first. The world and gameplay are very detailed, and the game doesn't really act like most games in helping you along. This learning curve can be very intimidating when you first start playing, and actually had me put the game down after a few hours, thinking I would never pick it back up. Boy am I glad I did. All of those reasons that make it so difficult to start make it so rewarding once you can some momentum. One of my favorite all time games is Baldur's Gate 2. That game was so professionally crafted, and although it was an open-world RGP on the surface, it doubled as a complex strategy game. Unlike most games of today, the encounters were not levelled. That meant you could walk into an encounter with enemies at a much higher level than your character. Of course, you would probably be eviscerated in your attempt to just get out alive. Then after you reloaded your game, you would be obsessed at beating that challenge. You would try different spells, buy different equipment, try sneaking and backstabbing, different spells and scrolls, you would do anything possible to win. The game was amazingly open to your creative solutions, and once you finally found a strategy that looked like it worked, you would be exhilarated. I loved that about that game more than anything. While I have loved games like Skyrim since then, I have still never experienced anything quite like that since. Divinity: Original Sin may be the most worthy successor to Baldurs Gate 2 I have seen. The RPG elements are different. It takes more of an Elder Scrolls type style, where you can choose to start from base classes, but leveling up doesn't have class restrictions. You can start as a thief, then start learning spells. You can be an archer that knows water based spells, or a assassin that knows witchcraft. its more closer to the spirit of the 4th edition of D&D than advanced dungeons and dragons. Overall I think that works well. There are many choices to make that create nuanced changes to your gameplay. The setting and world is very detailed, but feels like a much smaller scale than Baldur's Gate 2. Though you can enter every building and talk and trade with every character. The game really excels in its combat. Everything works together and can be used strategically. You can put out fires with a Rain spell, you can light oil on fire to burn your enemies. You can shock everyone standing in a pool of water, you can blow up poison gas. You get up to four party members, and can make each of their skills compliment each other. My one buddy will often lay an oil slick on the ground to have my thief ignite with his flame spells(yes my thief is a pyrotechnic wizard). My actual wizard will often teleport an enemy close to my buddy's bruiser warrior character for quick dispatchment. There are a million and one different ways to approach a battle and we often lose miserably on a first encounter, only to eventually succeed after careful planning. There aren't many encounters you can really take for granted. There are probably less enemy encounters than in other games, but each one is hard fought and feels dynamic. Essentially, this is as far from a hack and slash game you can possibly have.In typical D:OS fashion, the crafting/inventory/item collection aspects are richly detailed and not explicitly explained. Its indicative of every aspect of the game. Most of the time it feels like a developer is trying to point out ever single part of their game in an effort to demonstrate how much time it took to create it. Larian Studios is so absurdly casual about crafting one the most dense games in decades. We were basically ignoring cracting entirely until my partner found a  Guidebook[www.divinityoriginalsin.com] online. I thought all that stuff we were picking up was just meaningless stuff to sell. Needless to say, we are pretty excited to jump back into the game and try some of that stuff out.I don't have many complaints about the game, but I have some differences of opinions. Mainly, I wish that this was 4 player, considering that you can have 4 party members. Also, we my friend hosts our game, and the save files aren't accessible to me at all. I don't really own the characters I play with, its like he just grants me control while we play together. We also end up fighting over chests a little more than I like. Some recent games like Deathtrap brought some appreciated sharing of treasure. In D:OS, we tend to greedily race to the dropped loot after a battle and walk into traps looking for chests.			"

This game is a pretty and glorious magic sandbox that will send your two characters flyiing.  Its also a game designed for carefully exploration with two partners online.

												This is great if you want something a bit different and a relaxing casual coop to play with a mate. It combines some good open-world RPG with more intense turn-based-strategy and I feel the mash-up works well. As an Open-World game there's also plenty of scope to do things with or without your coop partner, which is a nice change from games like Diablo 3 that force you to stick together the entire time.It's hard. Really hard. But that's refreshing too. Stick with it though and it's delightful and rewarding.			"

Short version:I found this to be the best game I've come accross in the past few years, definitely worth to get it.Pro:- Excellent Co-op experience- Great combat system and game mechanics- Amazing art and music- Offers challenge to a wide variety of people- A lot of entertaining quests and conversations- The possibility to have multiple characters/companions with some rather unique set of skills- Quite much entertainment for money spentCons: - If you're not so experienced with similar games, the first 5-6 levels can be a very rough start- Personally encountered very minor graphical bugs here and there (they might be not as widespread though, my friend doesn't have them)- Sometimes the controls and positioning can be a bit off (easy to misclick in a combat and waste points on movement instead of attacking, backstabbing position seems weird quite often, relatively hard to see where the environmental effects begin and end)Neutral:- While conversations are amusing, some might find there are way too many quests involving jokes and puns.- Really addictive. When your friend in co-op tells you the second day in row: ""Dude, did you realize it's 6 am already?"", then you know you spent too much playing the game.Longer version:I'd definitely suggest to buy it, but for the maximum level of entertainment you should get a Co-op partner too with voice communications - possibly one that's willing to read through plenty of conversations and play during same hours as you do. If you're anything like me and not really familiar with games like these, you might want to read up on basic game mechanics - such as sneaking, stealing, pickpocketing, the reactions of elements in combat, weaknesses of different opponents - otherwise it might be a rather tedious start. With a sub-optimal party you might run into trouble in the first couple of levels already. The game itself offers a wide variety of skills and classes (at least I'd consider it so nowadays) which results in quite good combat scenarios, the only thing that can be a bit of a letdown if the randomness turns against you - but that's part of the game.Aside from combat, there amount of quests, side-quests and just interesting NPCs is just incredible. Many of them will basically require you to do some sort of investigation based on what you're learned through your conversations, sometimes you might just have to talk with dozens of NPCs to find out who can help you, sometimes it takes several minutes to find that hidden switch or logic to progress to the next part of the quests. Which is really a good experience from the old times, seeing how almost all the new games will save you from using your brain at any cost.The level of details is very good as well. There're towns with multi-leveled buildings, each of them have dozen of items like tables, chairs, cups, knives, paintings, quill, ink and whatever you can imagine. Some of these you can steal and vendor, others can be used for crafting! You can even move most of these. The art and voices are pretty good and the music is just perfect. Really the only thing that annoyed me was the sounds of characters speaking in caves, there's a weird echo to it, but it's nothing major.While the positive things by far outweigh the negative in this game, I do have to mention some of the annoyances - although these might be fixed soon enough. One of these annoyances are the downtimes between battles and conversations, when you're basically doing nothing but traveling. The default movement speed on your characters are pretty slow, while there're waypoints to help that, often you just have to move back and forth between NPCs to find out what to do. It's the same thing with healing between fights, feels just like a pointless downtime (although I can see how it could be exploited).Other than that, there're some minor things, such as it's hard to see when are you actually going to step on an environmental effect (you might think your character can pass right near that little blazing grass, but sometimes it'll set you on fire) and there seems to be a little inconsistency between host and a co-op player on where some of the enemies are facing - this and the very small angle at which backstab works can make the life of Scoundrels a nightmare early on. A friend of mine and me spent almost 30 hours with this game so far and we can't see the end of it yet. We might still create new characters once we finish, as we didn't even get to try crafting properly yet, or the quests where you talk to animals, or a lot of characters, or the steam workshop, or many of the other things this game can offer! The point is, it's one of the very few purchases in the past half dozen years that I didn't regret and for that I bow before Larian Studios. "

								Things burn when they get fire,  water freeze with frozen magic,  people can't see you if you are invisible (even scripted events)...   theres a world simulated inside this game that follow the rules of physics and magic. This game is a pretty and glorious magic sandbox that will send your two characters flyiing.  Its also a game designed for carefully exploration with two partners online. Its the answer to a question we did not knew it existed. ""Wheres is the perfect coop Baldurs Gate?""			"

								This game, is so much fun, reviews weren't kidding when they said it feels like a modern day Baldur's Gate. So far im 11 hours in and havent even touched the surface of even the beta content. This game makes you think about how to complete quests instead of just a ""go here"" marker. You see there is oil on the ground and an enemy is standing it it... Great, how can you use that i wonder, well you throw a fire spelll and it explodes for massive damage. Only one of the many ways you can use the environment to your advantage in D:OS!			"

												Once upon a time, they used to make role playing games for computers.   They weren't strategy/action/shooter hybrids. They weren't massively multiplayer.  They were just RPGs -- no hypens, no prefixes.  They had titles like Ultima, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Fallout (1 & 2), Neverwinter Nights, Arcanum, Dragon Age: Origins.  These were awesome games and a lot of people loved them, but game publishers decided that they weren't generating enough revenue so they stopped making them.Larian has successfully revived a dead genre and updated it in a meaningful way.  And they somehow managed it without a publisher and the compromises that come along with them.  I could list the reasons why I love this game, but I really want to get back to playing.  So all I'll say is this:  if you've ever enjoyed a real computer RPG, get this game.  If you're sick of gear grinding, F2P schemes, and consolization, buy this game.  Don't wait for a sale.  Just click the button and buy it.  You can thank me later.			"

												Take Divine Divinity world. Add party members. Add turn-based combat. That's something similar to what it plays like. If you're looking for an easy going, streamlined experience where you always know where you're going, and what you need to do, then stay away. You're probably not going to like it.If however, you like old school rpgs like Ultima 7/Morrowind (Not the rest of the series, just Morrowind with it's no quest markers and having to read quest logs/dialogue to figure out what you've got to do) then this is going to be a blast for you.So far.. I'd really probably call it, a modern day Ultima 7 without the awful combat system they switched to and reviving the Ultima 6 turn-based system.. but also modernized.One last note, if you're not a fan of a little monty python/terry pratchet humour in your games.. you're also going to have issues.But from an old-school rpg fan, this is a damn treat and I'm enjoying the heck of it.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥... Baldur's Gate, is that you?   This game is the closest thing to BG I have played in years.  It has all of the moral ambiguity (kill peasants for their pocket change, or help those in need if you would prefer).   The graphics are gorgeous with an adjustable top-down perspective that is reminiscent of BG / Neverwinter nights.  Character development & customization is deep , allowing you to tailor your character's strengths with different perks, traits, skills, and equipment.    The dialogue is also pretty hilarious and the NPCs feel surprisingly 'alive'.    10/10.   I cannot wait to see where this game goes.			"

If you are use to RPGs that hold your hand and tell you what to do, this is not the game for you. You have to THINK, SEARCH, and READ, lots and lots of reading. The combat is turn based so dont expect to click your way out of a fight. Its quite refreshing to see a game like this come out. Go buy it, what are you waiting for?			"

												Overall: 8/10What a fun, polished, classic-style RPG!D:OS is hands down the best RPG of this sort since Dragon Age: Origins. Interesting combat system, good story line, and never a dull moment.PROS+ Not a single ""fetch"" quest. Seriously, about 100 quests and not a single one of them falls into the ""go get me 10 pairs of smelly panties"" category. + Excellent graphics with bright colors, excellent level of detail, atmospheric nuances, weather, terrain, all very beautiful to watch.+ Interesting, innovative, detailed and hard to master combat system. When ""fight"" is on, solid tactics are essential.+ Lots of content, areas to explores, NPCs. D:OS' world is very much alive and full of detail. A single, completist playthrough is well over 100 hours.+ Humor galore. Easter eggs, puns, funny remarks everywhere. For the first time ever I even paid attention to ""achievements"", each one a nod to some more or less obscure rock track (Sleeping Village, Disciples of the Watch and No More Mr Nice Guy among my favs).+ Appropriate sound track, not invasive, you won't feel the need to turn it off.+ Game is very polished, in 150 hours i've encountered just one, quite minor, graphic glitch.CONS- Characters are devoid of any real personality: voice overs are sparse, character build doesn't help, you don't really get attached to your main character as you would have done with Origins, or ME's Shepard, or even with Baldur's Gate. You get stronger and stronger, but you don't ""grow"".- The UI would need an overhaul, inventory management is tedious and a time waster.- Some quests are too obscure and counter intuitive, if you really want to complete everything you will need to go check a walkthrough from time to time unless you enjoy pixel-hunting for a semi invisible knob or switch.

												I have played many many games and very few of them offer the freedom, satisfaction, and fun that Dvinity: Original Sin brings to the table. Most modern RPGs are more action than RPG, and suffer from dumb downed and simplified gameplay to appeal to a broader audience. Well Divinity: Original Sin brings the depth and interaction of older series like Baldur's Gate as well as beautiful graphics and music that really brings the Dungeons and Dragons style genre to the next level. Quests require you to talk to various npcs, whose dialouges are always extraordinarily written, and read excerpts from journals and books to uncover plots and mysteries as well as unravel your tale as a Source Hunter. There are no quest markers or waypoints, which may leave you lost or searching for what to do next, but as you adjust and learn to put the pieces together you will find yourself immersed in the beautiful world, Every aspect of the game just feels so finely polished and well made. Dialouges with npcs are engaging and many times hilarous. The word intuitive is thrown around a lot for games, but the crafting system in Divinity definitely deserves it. I don't want to give too much away but one small example is you can take a knife to a pillow to get a feather, which can be combined with the same knife to create a quill which can be crafted into various other things. The world is extremely interactive, rivaling AAA titles like Skyrim with the ability to pick up and move around almost every object, including chests and barrels. The combat is turn-based, with each party member having a number of action points, determined by various stats, that are used to move, use skills, etc during combat. It is very tatical, and the environment plays a huge role. You can lay down oil, slowing your opponents and limiting their action points for a couple of turns, then even light the pool of oil on fire buring everyone standing in it. There are many combinations like this, such as making it rain then electrocuting and stunning opponents standing in the pool of water that forms. One of the big ways the combat stands out is that buffs and debuffs play a serious role in the combat. Being stunned, knocked, down, etc can take someone out of a fight for multiple turns, creating huge advantages. Fights are very tough, and you are almost always fighting someone a higher level than you are, so utilizing your skills correctly is key to a satisfying victory. You can also converse with the people in your party, discussing events and things that you've done. You also discuss with your party when making decisions for quests. There are multiple meters for how people percieve you, such as independent/dependent, heartless/compationate, bold/cautious, that change based on the decisions you make and things you say. The icing on the cake of Divinity: Original Sin is that all of this can be experienced with a friend. There is drop in/drop out co op that is super easy to use. You can split up control of your party amongst the two of you and set off on your adventure.I can not reccomend this game enough, especially to any who find themselves going waypoint to waypoint completing boring quests or easy mind numbing combat in other games. For casual gamers I would still recommend this game, but heed my warning that you may find yourself lost and not sure where to go next, or having difficulties in a tough fight. You can always turn the difficulty down though if you're having too much trouble. So get out there. Explore. Discover. Interact.			"

												YAY's:- Great combat mechanics; emphasis on abilities and terrain/objects interaction.- Beautiful graphics engine; vivid colors and nice particle effects.- Good lengthy storyline/dialog with a quirky sense of humor.- Excellent music, sound effects, and character voice-overs.- Hot-join 2-player coop; party members can be reassigned.- Dev studio that listens to the community and quickly patches.- Toolkit to develop your own mods.- Very limited player hand-holding (challenging enemies, no quest markers, no auto-crafting); may be a NAY for some?NAY's:- Interface (inventory management, spell bar, party grouping) is clunky.- Character and weapon/armor aesthetics are lacking in variety.- Requires a larger amount of customizable hotkeys.Divinity: Original Sin is a love letter to earlier cRPGs like Ultima 7 or Baldur's Gate. Player characters are completely customizable, not pigeon-holed to a specific class. You can build whatever combination you desire, though some builds may be more effective than others. Combat is turn-based and individual battles may take as long as 20 minutes to finish. Battles are tough as you will typically be outnumbered. However, taking time to learn the mechanics is very rewarding and you will finish each battle feeling like a tactical genius. The game can be played single-player but the coop experience is where the game really shines. A friend can join your game at any point and control any character(s) that you assign to him/her. Larian Studios have been really stellar in quickly releasing patches and hotfixes post-release. This developer deserves your money. Buy this game.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is another masterful entry into the critically acclaimed Divinity Universe from the wonderful Larian Studios!Divinity: Original Sin follows in the footsteps of it's predecessors, throwing the player into a magnificiently crafted world full of character intrigue, mystery, betrayal and hope. The story plot is free-flowing, allowing for ""maximum"" freedom in the choices one can make (and although it works quite well at the best of times), it often requires moments of linear gameplay in order to avoid stalls, glitches, etc. The written script is intelligent, often subtle in humour and philosophy. Character customization is similiar to previous titles, allowing for the greatest degree of freedom in hybrid builds and mashups of class types. Combat takes a different turn, heading towards turn based battles - although free movement exists outside of combat. Again, almost all items in the game world can be stolen, found, bartered or sold. Crafting requires a solid memory, as the instructions for craftables are found within lore books, often in rhyme and poetry. Divinity boasts memorable characters, easter eggs and references (in one instance a solid, yet humourful, recommendation to buy Dragon Commander)...Original Sin's visuals are not spectacular, but unique and arresting to the eye. Colors are bright and vivid, spell effects are often satisfying, and character animations are smooth and fluent. The music of Original Sin is a fantastic element, as composer Kirill Pokrovsky comes aboard once more, delivering a beautiful, atmospheric soundtrack as befits the games style. The mechanics are well implemented and reactive, as you can create hazardous surfaces of fire, ice or slime with combinations of the elements. The content is satisfying (even the semi-pointless Golden Grail and Zandalors Trunks). The UI is simple to follow, the controls easy to master. Character voice overs are rare, but professional in tone and fluency of language. Multiplayer boasts an interesting concept of drop in/drop out gameplay, as the host of any game has complete control over the progression of all characters - only allowing for drop-in players to progress in the campaign, influencing little change over the character controlled.Divinity: Original Sin is a magnificient title from a wonderful developer, and is absolutely well worth the money and time for those who enjoy tactical RPG experiences with freedom of choice!

												Divinity: Original Sin is one of those game that brings you back to the good old time of BG1/2 and F1/2. AP based combat, thrill of advanture and freedome in completing quests are this game strong points. It took me 4h to explore the city about 20h+ to leave the first area and there are at least 100h ahead. Let's not forget about the optional multiplayer. You and your friend can embark on a jurney thogether or join in mid game.You can craft your equipment, skill books, food it's a real game that puts RP back into RPG ( :P ).Best purchase and best RPG this summer! A bust buy for fans of BG1/2 and F1/2!			"

												This will go down as being one of my favorite games of all time.  I originally go this in Early Access and fell in love.  This game is NOT for you if you want a game to hold your hand and give you quests like ""go kill 10 wolves"".  This game is NOT for you if you don't want to actually have to think in order progress in the game.The editor alone is worth the price of the game.  The fact that you get the game and the editor is stupid good.  This company basically made an A+ engine and then gave it away with the game.  In my opinion they could've easily held onto it and released DLC campaigns.  Instead they decided to give them to the community.  You'd be hard presseds to find someoen who doesn't enjoy this game.15/10 .  I am legit in awe of Larian studios.  Thank you for creating this work of art.			"

												This game is downright amazing. At first I didnt really know what I was doing, but with more reading and exploration the game really. Questing is not just started by marked NPCs. A journal entry is made and you must read and explore on your own to get things done. Crafting also happens to be solved by exploring your ingredients. Simply by putting random herbs in a vial or special arrow heads onto a shaft, no crafting table or work bench required. The game makes you want to talk to everyone and has an interesting interaction between your two main characters through interactive conversations. This game is a great old school turn based rpg and the immersion makes you feel like you are in a very interaction DnD campaign.The only cons I can think of are the movement sometimes seems clunky and multiplayer is currently only 2 player. It seems that a mod is already in the works of changing the multiplayer to 4 players.Divinity: Original Sin is a must buy for any avid rpg player.			"

												Now that the game is released I can share my thoughts and experience with it and hopefully help someone make the choice if this game is for them or not.I bought the game during its early access stage and completed the first portion it had (25% of the total game) for two times, then fiddled with it after each major update and I have to say that the game has evolved quite nicely, much better than I thought it would be.The final version is great and works. I have heard of people experiencing some problems (or finding bugs), I've yet to find anything however so I won't say that its bug free or otherwise. But how is the game itself? First of all, this is not your standard RPG like Diablo or Skyrim, its much more tactical. Think back to games like Dungeon Siege 1 where you had a party and each battle depended on the action you told each member to take, it depends on how you approach the battle and how well prepared you are. At the same time the game does not hold your hands at all. You have a quest book which gives you information about what you need to do but most of the time it won't tell you where to go directly. It will however give you hints and its up to you to find out how you can complete the quest. This is much more refreshing since it opens up the world a lot, it makes you think and revisit people and places to get more clues and ultimately complete the quest. Overall, once the quest is completed it feels so much more rewarding. The game is also pretty much open world. Its not as open world as Skyrim for example but its so much more than Diablo, meaning that its not a linear experience of going to point B from point A but at the same time those points exist. Its up to you how you get from one point to another and especially when you go. No one said you can't go from point A to point G from the get go, just be ready to face some strong opponents on your way.The NPC's in the game (friendly) are also very alive, they won't just sit idle while you steal from them, or rob their house. You can steal everything you want, just don't expect them to sit quietly and watch you take it all away. First they will stop you, then they will call the quards which in turn will land you in jail (if you do not stop stealing). But that doesn't mean the game forbids you from being an♥♥♥♥♥to the world. As long as no one sees you, steal as much as you like (since its so damn rewarding). Finally, the combat. Like I said in a previous paragraph, its a call back to the older games. The combat is turn based. You and your enemies take turns on hitting each other. You have a set about of Action points (AP) that you can use to do various things like moving, attacking, healing and so on. Once you run out of AP its time to end your turn and let the enemy do his thing. Because of this turn based system the game feels much more fresh and at the same time much more harder (which is very good for this title). One mistake might cost you the lives of a team member or your own (thankfully you can revive them as long as you have a ressurection scroll). Play your cards right and you will win battles with ease...you just need to pay close attention and think before acting. I personally recommend the game to RPG fans, especially those that loved the games of old and even more to the new people that haven't had the chance to try one of the old games due to various reasons.

												I have never played any of this series at all so I'm giving this review without the past tinting it in good or bad way for those that might not know anything about the game.  So I will give you with the bit I've played my first impressions with what I think is good and bad.Since I got it I haven't been able to get out of it... in a good way.  I'm totally addicted and found the game that suits me to the max.  This is turn based, so it gives me time to think without pressure yet still sitting on the edge of my seat at the fight.  It kind of threw me in the beginning though on character creation because I didn't know it was a duo... I was quite perplexed when I had to create two and customize them. (again I've never played any of the earlier ones so not even sure if that is how they worked in those)  But the whole two character thing had be curious right off the bat.  I figured it was basicly like a skyrim of a different flavor, story, etc etc.  But it isn't and it is!  For me, it's perfect.  It guides you along at the beginning yet gives you freedom to experiment and explore to start you out.  Perfectly balanced in my opinion for a brand new person.  They are great at the queues you need to not salp you in the face eyt pop up at the perfect time with suggestions.  They aren't obnoxious at all, but definitely letting you know about a new feature.I think it is an amazing and creative touch about the dialogs you have that affect the game between your two characters that you choose how it goes.  There are different options.   They really thought out of the box on this one.  I'm an animator for the film TV and gaming industries and not much impresses me. But this one did. the only negative thing I can say about it is the camera.  though it's not hard to get the hang at all on rotating it, they put a limit on it severely so you have to zoom in to see through walls at times, which is a feature of the game, not a bug.  It just messes up my immersion a wee bit, but i'm sure I will get used to it soon enough.  I just love the barter / selling / buying system a LOT.  items are as good as gold and visa versa.  it took me a couple times to realize I could switch between the characters in the same selling / bartering menu, but it's something that isn't hidden at all either.I could go on and on about it but in a nut shell, it's just amazing and I'm totally addicted and that is a huge feat to do with my line of work.Create an awesome day and kudos to the awesome creativity to the devs.  it is totally worth the price!~ ish			"

								Really fun gameplay even at this very early stage of development.It's an interesting mix of realtime gameplay that becomes turn-based just for combat.The combat is varied with both friendly npc's and enemies, and plenty of environmental effects such as barrels that can be destroyed spilling oil whic can be ignited etc.Character creation (which is yet to be developed with plenty of 'place holder' messages) looks as it will be quite flexible without having to follow a particular 'class', develope your own unique mix of skills.Graphics are pretty and the sound track so far is excellent.Very excited to see what this game becomes, especially once multiplayer is added!

								Want the ultimate RPG that allows you to do anything? feel like killing everyone? do it! Feel like stealing? Go ahead! Original Sin Is a turned based RPG that you can play along with a friend with who controls the other character. Depending on how you interact with each other the two characters could hate each other, be best friends. or even...lovers (>'.')> <('.'<).Currently in Early Access they let you play about 15hrs worth of content The devs say that the game in total with have 50 hours of gameplay. buy right now you also get the games Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity. The crafting in this game is very entertaining, if you want to make a pizza you have to have flour, water, tomatoes, and a hammer. Want to make a awesome club? get a branch and cover it with nails.At launch They will also be releasing a World/Adventure making editor to everyone who buys the game. This will add hundreds of hours to the game and give it a long life. For a Early Access this fun and bug free I have no choice but to recommend this game.-Ignious			"

Early Access Review
								Update 6/28/2014Still in love with this game, awaiting release, the patch they released on Friday has added sounds and what not to the menu actions, and also managed to make the game run even smoother than it was before.I know it's not full release yet, but i've already clocked in 100+ hours into this game, and  awaiting my collector's edition, so yeah, this is bascially my GOTY 2014, 2nd only to Shovel Knight or something.Update 4/25/14: I LOVE THIS GAME! - The Loading issue has been fixed- The framerate is smooth as butter even with V-Sync on- And there have been a whole bunch of fixes and changes that only make me love the game more and more.Original Review:I'll be honest i'm really enjoying this game a lot, I keep coming back to it wanting to play more and more because it's so good, but then I remember it's in Alpha and the saves aren't always compatible so I end up not playing, but over all the gameplay feels pretty good, it's an isometric turn based RPG in the vein of Baulder's Gate or Fallout series, but there's a lot of details that make the game feel really good, for example, you can basically attack anything, if there's a barrel of oil and you use a fire spell on it, you can make it explode, also you can use those spells on doors, allies, or anything that glows red when you aim at it.Another great thing about this game is the humor, there's a lot of funny puns and diologue you'll find in this game that you won't see in other fantasy based RPG's, like putting a bucket over your head as a helmet, or being about to use a guitar as a weapon that actually has decent stats, I remember one time there was this monster called ""adorable puppy"", then when it got closer you realized it was a zombie dog, which kinda weirded me out. Also I can't forget the music, the music is pretty top notch, I'm not expert on music but basically I can sit in the menu or one place without even doing anything but sitting back listening to the music. That's not to say the game is without it's flaws, since it's still in Alpha, that means there's a lot of issues and bugs, i'll just list them.- The loading time at the beginning and when you load up the game is pretty long.- There's a lot of areas that haven't been added to the game yet.- The framerate stutters for me with V-sync on and in high settings, I know my PC can run it pretty well at it's best, but this feels like a game play issue, not one with my computer.- The game is only about 20% done, so sadly, there's a bit of a wait before getting the full experience...

								Buy Buy Buy. Support these developers. The environments have more depth and detail than Diablo III. It is like playing D&D. The game play itself is a point and click adventure with a turn based combat system. For an Alpha, this game seems quite refined. Dare I say it, it is better than Wasteland. You may be thinking the price is high for an alpha version of the game, but it is totally worth it. The future of this game is going to be an intense experience. If you like RPGs that are heavy on story and combat, this is the game for you. I strongly urge you check this game out, you will have no regrets. DillengerX Out!			"

								A friend and I have been looking for a game like this and finding it is awesome. The combat system is a bit weird at first but you start to get the hang of it. Also fights aren't just fights they are epic battles agaist 10 enemies sometimes. The Ranger is a bit crap honestly but it's alpha so still stuff to work on. The duel dialogue is awesome and you and your friend both have a say unlike in other games (Diablo 3). All in all this is an awesome game I recomend to COOP with.			"

								Just how badly has modern game design softened your ability to be engaged in whats really going on in the story? The odds are quite a bit and this game will really show that. It's pretty refreshing to not have a quest marker, GPS tracker, arrow guidance or any quest helpers other then a detailed journal and common directional sense. It's actually funny how simple tasks without these crutches can now cause confusion and maybe embarassment or frustration. Divinity Original Sin will allow you to once again be actually mentally engaged in the game in order to do progression rather then drudging through it like a undead. Speaking of undead there are plenty of them as the Soure Hunter you are you will be battling a lot of them. With very rich detail, an enthralling soundtrack and turn based combat, Divinity Original Sin will satisfy any real RPG fan.			"

								Real-time exploration combined with turn-based combat that is intuitive enough not to be a hassle every time you get into a fight. So far, this alpha build is already a good representation of what I expect from an RPG, having played games such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and other Black Isle games in the day.  This game, to me, is a modern adaptation, with mechanics, of the RPG-style game I played back then.  The option to discuss amongst the party and shape the personalities of the characters is a great feature to enhance the immersion.  I hope they'll take this a step further and open/close party member choices based on your party's personalities.Options are limited in the Alpha, which is understandable. Still, I'll have to agree that this game is now near the top of my most wanted releases for this year and in my opinion already worth a recommendation. If you're a fan of RPG's, buy this.			"

												Ok, I don't review games to often. A game either has to be extremely good, or one you wish you could set fire too. So in a nutshell, is this game worth buying?  YesEven for £30? Take all my money!I bought this game in a sale, because I wasn't sure if It was my sort of thing. I like RPG type games, but it's not something I would spend a whole lot of time playing. Now yes I do have a rather low play time so far.. but in this very short amount of time, I can honestly say this is going to steal a whole lot of my hours. If they make more DLC, more missions, then i'm in.. even if I haven't finished the main campaign. The classes seem very well balanced, and theres so much control of what you can do. I'll update as I play through the game, but for now... YES, if you are a fan of this kind of game.. you will NOT go wrong. I'm playing with a friend at the moment, and we are both enjoying this very much.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is wonderful.  From the serious characters to the quirky characters to the crafting and the combat, this game delivers on all counts.  Improving it would be difficult, though not entirely impossible.Two things I love about it: 1. Every battle presents some degree of challenge with few exceptions as the adversaries are equally matched to the playable characters.  Even a difference of one level can be devastating (e.g. a level 7 adversary tends to annihilate a level 6 party member).  This does bar access to some regions of the world, but it does so organically.  You can attempt it and fail or you could mark it on your map and return later.2. All of the skills (special attacks) gained remain useful throughout the game.  In many RPGs, the early skills become useless partway through and/or get replaced by upgraded versions.  In D:OS, they remain pertinent and never get replaced or outclassed by an upgraded version.  This is due to the skills scaling in effect as the characters progress improving their attributes and equipping superior weapons as well as to the old school combat system.  For instance, Minor Heal remains useful later on because its cooldown decreases as Intelligence increases and so, my healer could cast it every single turn by level 13.  I use it while Strong Regenerate cools down and out of combat to quickly recover the party.One thing of which to be aware: The game begins slowly and the beginning is not overly engaging.  It is a game that gets better as you play it which has pros and cons.  The pro is that it is wonderful as I said; the con, that many people give up on it early on.  Honestly, I did not play it for a while because it did not engage me as I am accustomed to games doing.  Give it a few hours and once you can leave Cyseal without being murdered by undead, you can really start enjoying it.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin (DoS) is an excellent rpg game. With stunning graphics, nearly endless choices, and lots of difficult, advanced battles, DoS is an epic rpg. NPC's show lots of personality, whether or not they repeat the same lines over and over. Dos allows you to interact with the environment. For example, if a wooden barricade is blocking your path, you can shoot fire at it, then make it rain to diffuse the fire to continue walking your original path. No game can be perfect, and DoS is no exception. Early progression can be difficult and long, and people that dislike turn based combat will likely dislike the combat sequences in the game. DoS is a top down, Open world Rpg Epic.			"

								So i haven't played alot of this game, only due to the fact save games keep getting wiped. Absolutely understandable though, i've been holding out until official release to delve into it so i don't keep repeating the same stuff over again. Now even though i say i don't want to repeat the same stuff over again, this game gives an absolute crap load of freedom and is an amazing point and click RPG with turn based combat.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a slow paced RPG with an indepth dialogue for your characters and NPCs you bump into, or even just passing by. Not to mention the multiplayer i haven't played yet but cannot wait to argue decisions with a friend on our journey.Buy this game!			"

												I both love and hate this game. I really didn't think I was going to get it at first simply because the turn based combat was a red flag for me. A friend of mine ended up gifting me the game and I can say that I'm very happy for that. My initial concerns about the combat disappeared after a few hours and I got used to it. The game has a huge amount of qualities which make it very interesting and fun. To list a few: Skill combinations inside and outside of combat, unique uses of skills, rewarding exploration, interesting side quests, rich lore, absolutely zero hand holding, and I can go on. If you have no interest in reading, having to remember details, writing down reminders for yourself or simply want an easy game to quickly beat and mark off the list... well this game isn't going to be for you. Many aspects of this game are very rewarding, but it also punishes you.. secret traps, games of chance, and a wide variety of other insta death mechanics are virtually everywhere in the game. There is a feeling of ambiguity which envelops the entirety of the game, this is something I enjoy a lot but many people seem to hate; a prime example being the completion of hard puzzle which the rewards at the end are completely trash. Now the game isn't without problems. I've run into many bugs, issues of movement, and not all of the billions of lines of dialogue are interesting. There are faults to be had, but there is something about this game which keeps you playing. A feeling I have not felt in a long time.. even the more boring content is bearable. I often found myself going to a new area, and spending hours talking, reading and exploring.. and at first it wasn't very exciting but something about the game gives you a special compulsion to carry on and unlock all those hidden bits of content. The game is still a little rough around the edges, but once you look passed that it is a very nice game which lives up its universe. Overall I would give it an easy 8/10, which some bug fixing it could probably reach a 9. I feel many of the issues I have in some game designs will probably be solved in future patches or mods.			"

												Amazing game, I was glued to my screen the first few days after I bought this game.Music: original, incredible, love the main theme.Graphics: A lot better than you would expect from an indie game, though it warmed up my GPU faster than I would have expected.Gameplay: Love the storyline, lots of sidequests, choices, free world, the only downside is everyonce in a while the entire progress of a quest hinges on you finding one button. Some quests had a very original way of solving them. I was stumped quite a few times, sometimes even hours on a puzzle, but when you solve them, it is extremely satisfactory. Using a walkthrough will reduce your enjoyment of this game a lot. As they hint themselves though: unless you are the most careful player in the world, save often. Bugs: Encountered 1 bug in my entire playthrough. It was annoying, but since the game has 10 autosaves standard(up to 25), it was pretty easy to just load one, which fixed the situation.Overall: Definitely in my top 10 list of Steam games I have ever played. If you are a D&D/pathfinder/.. player, you will love the open world, choices, consequences. 9/10			"

												The last time I felt this gleeful about the sheer freedom and breadth of possibilities of a game was playing Deus Ex for the first time. Divinity: Original Sin is maximalist game design philosophy at its absolute best in RPG form, even if the individual parts aren’t all top tier. I hadn’t played a proper party based CRPG since KOTOR and NWN back in the day and wasn’t particularly interested in the latest wave of Kickstarter revivals either, but curiosity and its promise of clever turn based tactics got the best of me after noticing D:OS had been the number one seller on Steam for WEEKS after its launch. I checked out a random gameplay vid on Youtube, which ended up being a whole encounter early on, which was enough by itself to immediately sell me on the game. Let’s be perfectly honest here, the battle system is the star here and is by far my favorite RPG combat ever. Seriously, nothing but the most complex SRPGs can even hold a candle to the veritable chemistry set of options available to players here. The encounters, at least in the first act, make excellent use of these systems resulting in around 30 hours of stiffly challenging tactical bliss. Just a few fight highlights just in the first map of the game:After realizing that fire ignites poison surfaces and hard landings cause impact damage, I teleport dropped my fire elemental summon close to enemies in a poison pool causing the entire pool to explode, in addition to the impact damage, killing everything in it instantly. Getting ambushed and surrounded on all sides by about 20 exploding barrel skeletons and having to cleverly manipulate chain reactions while not instakilling my party of 4 in the process.The final boss of Act 1 being some massive demon ♥♥♥♥er flanked by the three other, also quite difficult, sub-bosses of the act. Took me a few tries but I eventually took him down with no casualties after 30+ minutes of grueling combat. My favorite boss fight in a turn based game by a mile.Outside of combat, it’s still pretty damn good except for the overall plot and main story writing. I took a liking to the goofy tone (especially the talking animals, like my boy Unsinkable Sam and the murder victim’s dog, who surprising came into combat to help me fight some recently exhumed corpses), which some regard as out of place in a game like this but to me it makes perfect sense. When your various methods of interactivity are so playful and exuberant, why contradict yourself with the standard dreary dark fantasy self-seriousness? Speaking of playful interactions, there’s plenty of it outside of fighting. Pretty much everything in the world exists as a manipulable object with its own physics properties, health and such… Quests can be solved in a crazy amount of ways, which is necessary given the journal doesn’t give you exact information about the what and where. Investigations actually feel like investigations, not errands as they often do in quest marker oriented games. Anything that reminds me of Morrowind in that regard is a plus in my book.The difficulty and quality of the encounters take a dive after the Act 1, and to be quite honest I didn’t even finish it. Act 1 is transcendent enough to where that barely matters to me, and could be my GOTY based on it alone. What keeps me excited is the continued attempts of director Swen Vincke and Larian Studios to understand where they went wrong and to make iterations on this engine and formula for D:OS and future games[www.lar.net], building up towards what they call “the very big RPG that will dwarf them all”. They’ve immediately shot up into my pantheon of favorite developers along with FROM, Platinum, and EAD Tokyo and their future looks bright as hell.Shoutouts to the Kickstarter backers and and their collective milli and early access players for helping to make this happen with the balance and volume of stuff it deserved.

Early Access Review
								If you liked any other game from Larian..  you will love this one.In the tradition of the Divinity Series it has a fabulous humor,  a fantastic soundtrack and a fetching story.The fights are quite challenging, the KI is really intelligent: for example they loot their fallen comrades when they have a potion and use them, or destroy also elemental barrels, evade the 'traps' you have set or they take cover when there is no safe way to your party. Also the Deciding system is a great idea.. and the social boni, which grant you a lot of passive ability points.And at least.. it has cats!   Quests from Cats, a ""cat wedding"" and a cat-astic Sorcerer!  And a cat-bonus-song in the tavern!The only negative point is also the deciding system against the KI.   They use a quite simple algorythmic which is really easy to look through. There are ~3 ways how they use the rock-paper-sissors game.  For example: first they use Rock, than paper, scissors, rock, parper, scissors, ....       or  rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, ..    it could be that it was only coincidence.. (or my luck-skill!), but it was quite easy for me to win every contest.     I hope Larian make it more randomly.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 10/10Balance: 9/10 *Atmosphere: 9/10Leveldesign: 9/10RPG-Factor: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Difficulty: 7/10Crafting: 8/10Handling: 7/10Co-op: not testedLevel Editor: not testedTotal: 84/100* tested in Beta, but it was still totally playable and I found also only one Bug.

												Think of the original Fallout series but in a fantasy setting. You have a larger party with up to 4 members. It's got co-op too! It's light-hearted but has serious tactical turn-based combat. Character creation is deep and the possibilities are nearly endless. Dialogue is funny well done. Be prepared to sink many many hours in this game. I spent almsot 10 hours in the first town exploring(looting) all the houses and talking to all the people.			"

But it's the only game in town for RPG gameplay like this.The combat is hands down the best turn based combat of any RPG I have ever played.  Graphics and music/sound FX is great as well.  A true old school RPG with no hand holding almost at all, and enough content to keep you going for more then enough hours to make the purchase.If you have no idea what old school RPG's were like however, and think Bioshock was a RPG this might be to much for you...

												Divinity Original Sin is one very impressive title. Voted number #1 for 2014 by quite a few online media sites. And we could not agree more. Never before have we been such fans of a turn-based RPG. Original Sin is a must-have. For those are are eagerly awating the Linux build from Larian, note it's on the way. Our last update from Larian regarding the native build is ""when it's done"". :-) We have to give props to the development team for taking time in porting the game, Larian is known for releasing stable gameplay, even in alpha and beta builds. Therefore we have a huge appreciation for the team taking their time to maintain their originality and creativity.			"

Posted: July 10, 2014
												It's been a long time since I've played an old school RPG of this quality. I highly recommend it to RPG fans! Here is my breakdown:THINGS THIS GAME DOES RIGHTCustomization - Instead of setting the length and thickness of your character's nose, you get options that matter, like choosing skills, talents, and stats which add up to make your own custom class. Of course, you can pick from a default list and build it however you want if you prefer. This is customization done right.Difficulty - This game will kill you. It's not Dark Souls hard, but it's hard enough to give you a sense of satisfcation when overcomingits challenges.Non-linearity - Aspects of this game are non-linear. Ultimately it does have a linear narrative, but you can almost completely freely explore the world. You're limited mostly by your level, which is the main barrier limiting progression.Grinding - Most RPGs allow you (or force you) to gain excessive amounts of experience to out-level the game's content. That is the fundamental principle of the JRPG. This game only gives you enough experience to survive the next challenge which ensures that the difficulty of the game is more fine tuned and harder to trivialize.Puzzles - Not everything is explicitly a puzzle. Sometimes advancing the story is a puzzle in itself (like the old adventure games). Sometimes a combat has puzzle elements. Sometimes it's just a room full of traps. Either way, there's almost always a problem to figure out.THINGS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT LIKESpeed of Play - This is a slow methodical game best spent enjoyed at a leisurely pace. The turn based combat, sprawling maps, and slower paced movement speed means that it'll take hours to progress through what some may consider a small amount of content. For the perceptive and the patient, though, that content has a lot to offer.Tone - It's a fairly straight forward fantasy setting. It's fun, whimsical, and self aware at times. It doesn't get overly dark nor overly comical. It's not too geneteric or creative. It serves primarily as a backdrop for the gameplay.Co-op Dialogue - You can do rock-paper-scissors to overcome disagreements. What you choose impacts your stats in small ways. Min-maxers beware. Everyone else; have fun.Random Loot - This has pros and cons. On the one hand, each playthrough is different. On the otherhand, a lot of loot sucks. It's debatable whether or not random loot works in a game with a limited pool of enemies.Nietzsche - He can join your party. It's pretty neat if you're in to that sort of thing. The devs didn't actually name him Nietzsche, but you'll figure it out if you went through that phase in your teen years.THINGS YOU PROBABLY WONT LIKEOops - It can be easy to make it hard or impossible to progress in the game by killing an NPC, letting them get killed, or just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them off enough. Same goes for accidently clicking on an object or walking into a room that causes the entire town to aggro on you. Save often.Bugs - There's still quite a number of bugs, but they are very quickly being addressed. Still, be warned. Save often.			"

												I am giving this game a thumbs up with a few caveats.  It is almost the gold standard for RPG of this kind.  It is well worth the money, I got 87 hours out of it and I didn't even complete everything.  It is a lot of fun and is a dynamic world.  For example in most games where you see backdrops of crates you can't interact with, in this game you can.  You can move them or set them on fire.  A door locked and can't find the key?  Bash or burn it down if you like.Anyway,  I would strongly reccomend that you wait at least 3 months after this game is released to buy it for the following reasons.  By this time I sure hope there are good walk-though guides available.The quests in this game are very old-school.  They do not give you a lot of hints and there in no guidance in the least.  Some of them may require that you find hidden switches and hit them in the right order.  You will not know how many hidden switches there are.  You might find three of them and try all combos and nothing happens.  Well you need to find the 4th switch and try again... maybe find the 5th one?One quest requires you to find a hidden object, this is a main quest so you have to do it.  This object is ""somewhere"" in a large forest.  You need a perception of like 12 to ""see"" it.  Stats are very precious and you generally are not going to be able to pump perception as other stats are FAR more important.   The only way I solved it was by finding a screen shot of the locaiton, then moving my character there, putting on all +perception gear I could find, and THEN drank a super preception potion and FINALLY I could ""see"" this huge mound of dirt that had the item I needed.It is stuff like this that pisses me off and really takes away from this game.  I would really like to know if people find stuff like this naturally without guides.  Other than stuff like that, this is a great game.			"

												I didn't hear of this game until shortly before its release, but when I saw it in the Steam Sale and watched some gameplay videos of it I was instantly interested in it. An old-school RPG with turn-based combat, a well thought-through spell system (poison + fire = explosion, water/blood + electricity = stun, hitting puddles with fireballs makes them steam clouds, steam clouds + electricity = stun clouds and much, much more) and a huge, very detailed world with many secrets to discover make this game the best game I have played this year so far. I've heard people criticize the lack of a 100% voice-over, but Fallout 2 didn't have complete voice-overs and is considered one of the best RPGs up to this day.The negative points I have are these:- more or less bland companions. You don't get to know a lot about them, and both are only relevant for one or two quests overall, but depending on how you chose your main character's classes they complement your party very well. If you want to play ""alone"" (ie. only with your 2 main characters, there is an extra perk for that as well)- the story could have had better pacing. For the first half of the game the story makes total sense, you are investigating an outbreak of undeads and some other things on the side, and then suddenly everything gets overthrown and for a while you are left wondering what is going on. Luckily this gets cleared up shortly after, but it was still a little confusing in the beginning- the fights in the beginning of the game start out extremely challenging, but lose the intensity later-on as more of your characters can learn healing spells and have high resistances gainst the spell schools etc.. - also, money inflation is a problem. In the beginning you never have enough money, but after ~15h played I had so much money I traded items with vendors for free just to get them out of my inventoryHowever, these negative points are far outweighed by the positive aspects of this game, and it has been a long time since I put 65h+ into game in such a short time (the last game was Skyrim, and only due to mods that I spent so much time with it).If you like RPGs and you are not put off by turn-based combat or lack of complete voice-over then this is a must buy!

												Wow!  I'm only about 9 hours in, but so far Original Sin is blowing me away!  For anybody that likes a true old-school RPG, you should love this as well.  It's heavily reminiscent of Ultima 7 (which in my opinion is one of the greatest games of all time) in the way you can interact with the environment, the open-ended nature, as well as the general look/feel of the game.  It's also somewhat reminiscent of Baldur's Gate, which is also good thing. The combat is really enjoyable turn-based, which is actually an improvement over U7's real-time or BG's real-time with pause.  For a Kickstarted game, it looks and sounds gorgeous too.  I particulary love the way the environments look, although I admit some of the character art design isn't quite my cup of tea (the over-sized staves, greaves, semi-cartoonish look, etc.).  But that is a minor nit-pick on a really great game.  The game also has a generally humorous, not entirely serious nature, which is a bit of a breath of fresh air (I do enjoy more realistic, ""grimdark"" fantasy games, but let's face it, there are a lot of those out there nowadays).In a nutshell, anybody who enjoyed Baldur's Gate, Ultima, or any old-school RPGs, shouldn't hesitate to buy.  Anybody who enjoys newer RPGs (The Witcher, Elder Scrolls, etc.) should also enjoy it, as long as they're willing to try a game that is more challenging, and makes you figure some things out on your own.   OK, enough typing, time to get back into the game!			"

												Do I recommend this?  HELL YES!This game is a mix of all the old school greats, Ultimas, Baldurs Gates, Torment, Fallout, etc.What I liked alot:Story - There is a huge fleshed out world, lots of lore, books, etc for those that choose to read everything. The actual main story was fleshed out and interesting, it made me want to finish the game to figure out what happened. World - The world was pretty cool, very detailed with little things hiding everywhere for you to find.  They rewarded people that where willing to go adventuring. Graphics - Graphics where great, I had everything maxed out and did't have any preformance issues or find a problem with anything.  There where several different tilesets as well, so the world didn't get boring for me on my run through the game. Spell System - The spells where great.  Nice visual effects, can be mixed and matched to create extra nice effects, ie Lightning + Water.  This aspect also made you more careful, because if your own guy was in the water.... you get the meaning :). You had to be somewhat intelligent about what you cast also, spell effects would cause things like line of site issues, etc.  Hard to heal people when you drop a fireball between you and them and the place goes up in smoke and fire! Comabt - I've read reviews about people complaining about the combat, but it's perfect for this game.  It's turned based, initiative style, there's numerous different ways to finish off encounters and fights. It was as good of a system as I could have asked for for a multi character party game while still maintaining control of each charcter with precision.  What I liked but I thought could use some more work: Character Progression/Building- This was a little confusing at first, I didn't know what did what, what was good, etc. I had to do a little research outside of the game, but once I god how it worked, understood what was important and not so much I was good to go.  It was pretty easy to build an uber party, basically my 2 casters would buff my 2 frontline guys and they would go and destroy everything. With that being said maybe the difficulty could have been a little harder?Questing - Questing was great, there was some awesome quests, things that made me laugh, etc.  Some of the quests where hard to figure out and I had to get help from outside resource sites with where to go next because there wasn't enough clues (for me anyhow) telling me where to go.  I'm not asking for a big arrow pointing to everything, but some  more direction would have been more helpful, either on the map or in the quest log. Puzzles - Some of these where downright hard/impossible. I found myself looking for help more then a few times with how to solve puzzles, especiallly the weight puzzle. I have no idea how anyone would ever figure that out (This is after I tried for over an hour). Just asking for some more direction.  Crafting - The crafting was awesome and vastly helped out once I figured out how to use it but some of the blacksmithing stuff vs crafting stuff didn't make sense.  Regardless, make one of your characters have level 5 Crafting and Blacksmithing by the end of the game if you can.  There's numerous resource sites for how to make stuff also as the in-game books can be confusing, and are not organized, etc.  All in all, this is a great game.  The 9/10 reviews are spot on and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is nostalgic for an old school RPG in todays clothing.  The developers did an amazing job, and hopefully they have an expansion out soon, I know I'll be buying it.			"

Gameplay is exactly as youd expect a topviewing adventure game such as dungeons and dragons to be, but so much more refined than any D&D game ive played. There is tons of customization and literally hundreds plus of hours for gameplay. Overall I'd give this game a good 4.7 stars. Difficulty is pretty hard, but they do have adjustments. It really makes you think and plan out your moves and actions. I will be playing this game for a long, Long, LONG time.			"

												Haven't played a CRPG this deep in years, a real treat. Love the fact it has co-op. My only complaints are the mechanics are not explained very well and the game can be quite challenging when you first start. The story starts a bit slow and also meanders at time, but that’s not uncommon with open world RPG games. The general progression is still fairly linear and the game has a lot of side quests of varying interests. Overall Divinity: Original Sin is a good CRPG that’s worth your time.			"

												Would definitely recommend this game - The classic design your own characters, build your team, steal everything in sight to be profitable, or be a stand-by citizen and be broke. The possibilities are limitless!Really the class design has been done, many-times, but the co-op is what sets this game apart. One of the biggest issues I had with DA:O was the lack of co-op, especially in live time. Thankfully the turn-base of this game allows a single player to be more efficient than a co-op, but it provides a lot more entertainment value.The cons, are some of the bugs have been in the game far too long, and still haven't been resolved. Nothing game-breaking, just minor frustrating item bugs.My recommendation to new players: Teleportation is an amazing spell.			"

												First of all, I loved Divine Divinity and I waited long for its spiritual sequel and if anybody who reads this felt the same -	 Divinity Original Sin  IS this sequel. With a playtime of almost 20 hours, i didn't even get to the second map, I mean this game is HUGE! The combat is turn-based, everything else is real-time with a transition between combat and exploring.In all points, it is a upgrade to its predecessor: + a extensive crafting system + beautiful landscapes (although the texture quality could be better) + humor (a underestimated quality in games) + completely unrestricted skillsystem (a rogue attacking with close-combat mageskills, totally possible!) + many objects are destructable, movable AND you can ""borrow"" them. :) + the elemental system! (cover enemies in oil and light them on fire, then make it rain and freeze them. Only one example.) + Well, I'm done here, play the game, find a few points for yourself, be surprised.There is only one downside, most of the dialogs are not voiced, so there's a lot to read. (In case you want to follow the story)Other negative points, as descripted in the ""negative reviews"" section, are also partially true, but in my opinion these are minor setbacks for an otherwise great game.10/10 would play again, oh wait, I'm not done yet.

												Is this the spiritual successor to BG2, as some would claim? No, not really. But don't let that put you off, the game stands tall on its own and it does so better than any other ""old-school"" RPG in recent memeory.In truth, Rivellon has always had its own appeal with its quirky inhabitants and light take on just about everything. The world is alive and full of adventure with the mechanics well done, bar some minor bugs. Humor and magic go hand in hand and any shallow approach to the story is fully made up for with the incredibly fun combat system.

								My brother and I were searching for a great Co-op RPG game for a long time. It's turn-based combat (exponentially fun) is similar to Final Fantasy Tactics and can be punishing if you don't adequately prepare yourself for every battle. Even in early access this is a must have for any fan of hardcore roleplaying games. It includes both classic features (no respawn, set enemy level) and modern alike (save anywhere, online co-op, etc) Do yourself a favor and Get. This. Game.			"

												I love the combat and all the other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Few things to mention:Game is linear believ it or not. Yeah, nobody tells you what to do, but the enemies mark a specific pattern which is their level, if you are not leveled enough which most of the time, finds itself into a linear pattern, then you cannot go beyond the enemies of the same level than you, as they are incredible strong even if they are one level above you.Game is gore as hell, that's amazing.Lots of interesting spells and ways to manage them.The game gets absolutelly repetitive by the end, and the ending right now is horrible. Apparently the definitive edition will improve on many things, like voice acted dialogue and improved ending, improved spells. For PC owners of the original version, the update to the definitive edition will be for free.			"

												This game is honestly... I... well, I can't really put it into words. Many people compare this to old-school RPGs like Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and Ultima, and while I can honestly say I see the homage quite clearly, D:OS introduces many new concepts too. Co-op works seamlessly and flawlessly, the editor is great, and I can't wait to see what modders do with this game. My only main complaint about the game is the inventory system - it's a little clunky and hard to navigate at times, especially when you have a lot of items. The writing is clever and humorous, and I just found myself reading books and immersing myself in the world for hours on end - and I continue to do so as I play through the game.So, how do you know if this game is for you? Honestly, if you've enjoyed any old-school isometric RPGs in the past (or currently), chances are that you'll enjoy this game. For a newcomer to the genre of CRPGs? Watch a couple videos, if you have friends who personally like the game, shoot them a message and ask them why it's great. I also realize it's a pretty hefty price tag, but I honestly think it's worth it - especially with all that comes shipped with the game.			"

												Fantastically deep and challenging game in the style of Baldur's Gate and the great isometric RPGs of old. The puzzles are challenging, and unlike modern games, there's no hand holding to make them easier. The combat is rich and strategic. Most of all, the game changes based on the decisions you make with how you train your characters, how you approach quests, who's in your party, and more. The story is long and rich, meaning you'll easily get your money's worth on just the first playthrough; and because the game can be quite different each time you play, there's tons of replayability. Highly recommend this game to RPG fans.			"

												I am giving this game a thumbs up with a few caveats.  It is almost the gold standard for RPG of this kind.  It is well worth the money, I got 87 hours out of it and I didn't even complete everything.  It is a lot of fun and is a dynamic world.  For example in most games where you see backdrops of crates you can't interact with, in this game you can.  You can move them or set them on fire.  A door locked and can't find the key?  Bash or burn it down if you like.Anyway,  I would strongly reccomend that you wait at least 3 months after this game is released to buy it for the following reasons.  By this time I sure hope there are good walk-though guides available.The quests in this game are very old-school.  They do not give you a lot of hints and there in no guidance in the least.  Some of them may require that you find hidden switches and hit them in the right order.  You will not know how many hidden switches there are.  You might find three of them and try all combos and nothing happens.  Well you need to find the 4th switch and try again... maybe find the 5th one?One quest requires you to find a hidden object, this is a main quest so you have to do it.  This object is ""somewhere"" in a large forest.  You need a perception of like 12 to ""see"" it.  Stats are very precious and you generally are not going to be able to pump perception as other stats are FAR more important.   The only way I solved it was by finding a screen shot of the locaiton, then moving my character there, putting on all +perception gear I could find, and THEN drank a super preception potion and FINALLY I could ""see"" this huge mound of dirt that had the item I needed.It is stuff like this that pisses me off and really takes away from this game.  I would really like to know if people find stuff like this naturally without guides.  Other than stuff like that, this is a great game.			"

												This is pretty much everything I could have wanted in a Baldur's Gate-style RPG. You can steal pretty much everything that isn't nailed down, but you can't do it when anyone is watching, lest they alert the guards. You can bash doors and chests open if you don't have a thief in your party. There are a number of classes in addition to the classic 4 (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief), but you can customize them to however you'd like them if you don't like what Larian offers. Turn based combat where the environment affects your spells (Shocking a nearby enemy while it's raining may have the desired effect of stunning them, but it may also arc and stun yourself too!) Quests have multiple ways to solve them, which is sort of necessary, as you're limited to two party members. Oh, and when two different people play the two characters? You can argue about the actions you take and your dialog choices can affect how other NPCs react to you and how well you can persuade them to do things they may not want to, via Intimidation, Charm, and appealing to Reason.I think my only real critique is that in combat, it's super easy to accidentally target something you didn't mean to and thus waste a turn, possibly to lethal outcomes.Overall, it's a fantastically fun game that takes the best parts of Planescape: Torment and Fallout 2. The competitive co-op is just icing on the cake.			"

								Definition RPG. Much like Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity. Its a throw back to the classic pin and paper RPG. Influences from Temple of Elemental Evil are present along with feelings of many others, but still having its own charm and appeal. Highly recommended for the RPG enthusiast and people who like to read. Oh yeah, lots and lots of reading. So be prepared. Combat is fun and adaptive to many different play styles. Spells like teleport bring so much utility to the game that you'll end up finding more uses than just dropping one enemy onto another enemies head. I.E. teleport you friend to the other side of a lava pit and collect treasures. Support this dev team and studio. They deserve it. Oh and tool kit for modding? Looks very promising from the live streams I have watched over Twitch.			"

												Great RPG in the spirit of Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights. The magic system is simple to understand initially but the implementation of it is much more complex in game. Many strategic options and a big wow factor for animation graphics to support it. The graphics all in all are pretty stunning too. Character system, much like Fallout 3, allows you to make completely custom skilled characters with ""perks"" based on skill level. The crafting actually has a much more involved application in game play than most RPGs. The recipes, like the magic system, is initially easy to pick up but the implementation is complex. Engaging. Deep. Rich graphics. Dynamic spell system. All in all, probably one of the most enjoyable RPG's I've played.However, this is not an RPG to hold your hand. e.g. Books  and texts you come across aren't fluff for you to just store away in a container so don't expect a detailed quest log to refer to that will effortlessly point you in the right direction; Keys are not group carried so mind who your inventory; vendors are limited but you can trade with everyone (like Fallout 3); Retreating is an option that is necessary in many cases so don't think that your super powerful party won't have to make like hockey players to get the puck out of there. Casual gamers may have a harder time staying focused with  this game.			"

								These guys KNOW how to do a Kickstarter campaign better than most any developer I've seen.  They constantly keep you in the loop about EVERYTHING they are doing and why and showing updated videos covering everything with superb answers to live questions.  It's been a thrill to watch this game come into being and it's the first one that has surpassed all my expectactions.  The Turn Based nature is so versatile, characters can be so unique, Co-Op is just way beyond what I would have expected and then even more beyond what I could have expected is the Editor that allows everyone to create their own games to freely share with others.  Not since Never Winter Nights have I see this attempted.  It's just amazing all they have been able to complete and I'm so happy to have been able to help Kick Start this wonderful achievement.   I'm still holding off to play more fully until the full release but from testing it all out regularly everything has been improved on steadily and I haven't come accross any  bugs personally.  It all looks beautiful and deep.  I've given to many Kickstarter Campaigns, but this one has really been the best by a long shot in covering all that a Kickstarter campaign should.  I hope many other developers go by their example.  While waiting I've just gotted into Divinity 2 which I somehow missed along the way and it's been a blast too!  Larian and CD Project are now my two favorite developers!  Oh and surely check out the Twitch TV interviews that go along with this game.  They are soo good.  One just uploaded on the 18th even.  But check out the ones before it if you have any questions because they go into great depth.   "

												This was my first PC RPG, so my review is without any nostalgia for this type of gameplay. And I loved the game. It wasn't perfect -- at times some things enfuriated me (backstabbing related usually), but overall it was amazing. I was obsessed. I still am. The good:1. The battle system is great. There's a lot to think about and reason to pay careful attention to what enemies are doing on their turn. The game can be very hard, so optimizing your moves and performing smart combinations matter.  Magic spells can interact with each other in really rad ways.2. There are a lot of ways to complete quests, but it is still challenging to complete them.3. Non-combat skills feel very important! Crafting, being able to talk to animals, teleportation -- all of these and more can help a lot.  With a high enough pickpocket talent you can steal from anybody in the game (who has items to trade, such as all shop keepers).4. SO MUCH TO DO in every town! It really encourages exploration and does a good job of rewarding you.5. Side stories and quests can be very interesting and funny.6. The coop is well implemented. There are fun dialogs you can argue with your partner in. And it makes exploring towns go much faster when you split up.The bad:1. I've heard people say the UI for this game is good. It's not. This must be a ""compared to other PC RPGS"" thing.  Your inventory will be a mess without enough good options for organization. Crafting can be a real pain because of this. Dragging an item through your inventory page by page is annoying. You can look at ""only ingredients"" in your inventory, but this doesn't help when you need to combine an ingredient with a weapon. I got around this by dragging things into pouches for crafting.2. The learning curve is a bit rough, especially with certain classes. I hated my Rogue for his first 6 levels or so. Part of the problem is that there isn't a very good UI for backstabbing.  Enemies stand in all sorts of weird poses, so it's not always obvious where their back is -- you can waste a lot of action points trying to find an enemies back.3. SO MUCH TO DO it can be overwhelming. Especially in the first town. It's best to just explore each town fully then leave the town only when you find you must (especially the first town, as you can level up a lot without leaving it).4. People can be pretty wordy. Especially Jahan. He likes to use a lot of words to say some lofty stuff that basically isn't interesting.  5. It can be hard to follow dialog if you aren't the one being talked to (when playing coop). You don't get to see the normal dialog screen, instead it flashes above the NPC talking. Since NPCs like to use a lot of words regardless of what they are saying, often there's no time to read it. You can follow in a special dialog menu, but it's annoying to have to do that.			"

												This is definitely the best RPG I've played in years. The game has very little hand-holding and it makes you have to figure out stuff on your own. Quests aren't simply little exclamation points over character's heads, you don't have to necessarily run back to town to ""turn in"" a quest, you're not given a little point on a map for you to follow. This game wants you to become invested in its world, and invested I have definitely become. In most RPG's I've played recently I know the names of like, maybe 2 NPCs, because if I need to go to them for some reason the game will say, in capital letters, ""GO HERE AND TURN IN THIS SPECIFIC QUEST TO PROCEED."" This game doesn't do that, it's not its style.The first main quest in the game is essentially a murder mystery, which might not sound too amazing on paper, but it's a fantastic starting point in the game because it forces you to become invested in the world by talking to all of the NPC's, learning their relationships, collecting clues, etc... Your journal in the game recounts what you've learned, but it doesn't make any of the deductions for your, it's up to you, the player, to deduce who you think is the murderer.This type of quest design pervades throughout the game. If you play this game you may become a little frustrated at first because of how used current gamers are to having their hands held, but if you persevere (and please don't use a wiki) then you will find one of the most immersive and enjoyable games you'll ever play.

												The best RPG I've played in a very long time. The closest a video game can get to a pen and paper RPG, Chris and I spent our first 5 hours just wandering around town literally doing nothing but stealing paintings, talking to kittens, and occasionally massacring random villagers. There's a lot of humor, a million ways to play the game, great turn based combat that is definitely not overly easily or too hard. The co-op is the best I've seen in an RPG, you can each make independant decisions and actually have your characters argue ending in a game of rock paper scissors, the victor getting the final say. The game doesn't hold your hand at all, so expect to have to learn and be creative, just as you have to do in a pen and paper story. There's crafting thats entirely experimental that I can't find two online lists that have found all the same things because theres that much. It's classless so you can really make your own character who you want them to be. There's a huge long story to this game, but I've been completely satisfied with my purchase and excited for the rest of the game without even venturing very far from the first town. I highly recommend Divinity if you are a fan of RPGs.			"

												If you're into old-school PC RPGs, like Ultima and Baldur's Gate, you gotta get Divinity: Original Sin.It's a love letter to those kinds of games with a great modern sheen. And the writing and world are definitely more Monty Python and Pratchett than Tolkein and Martin. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you can co-op the entire game!It's a great game from a great studio and if you were thinking that the Dragon Age was gonna be your RPG for the year, I'd recommend you give Divinity a shot instead.Also, you can talk to animals and they all have something neat to say.  That dog is dope.			"

I watched videos of combat on you tube and it looked slow dull and boring.Friend at work described it as X-Com (which I loved) - so took the plunge - very glad I did cannot recomend this game enough.

												So after reading and watching all the review videos I decided to give this a shoot even at full price. So reviews claimed this was the best RPG of all time. After the first 5 hours I didn't agree, after the next 5 I started to think maybe, after 25... I agree this is the best I've ever played. So many things are so well done and for me this easily passed BG1&2 and TOEE w/mods.			"

												A turn-based tactical rpg with a decent story and and nice gameplay. It is ridden with glitches and requires a lot of polish to be a real gem, but it's redeeming traits are a campaign co-operative mod for two players and the freedom the game gives you to experiment with the abilities your characters have. What it lacks in straightforwardness of the story it makes up in the multiple ways you can progress the game.As the saying goes, always keep a game for two players at home. This is the choice for a gaming couple.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is the greatest party based RPG to come out in years. It is a game that doesn't hold your hand; you can skip through dialogue with NPCs for quests but you won't get a quest marker, just a note in your log. You don't start off with crafting recipes, you have to read short entries in books to learn how to craft an item, and even then you won't see the recipe pop up in some sort of universal crafting list that counts your materials for you.It's a game that often time requires you to think if you want to progress in a quest. Many times I have advanced a quest simply by inserting myself in the situation - If I were in this world, what would I do next?You are challenged with harrowing bouts of turn based combat in which 4 characters you control ( 2 entirely player created, the others are companions ) and where every move you make is important, and every spell you cast, puddle of water you electrify or spill of oil you light aflame can turn the tide of a battle in your favor. The game has a fantastic system of being able to interact with the environment and create hazards to your advantage.The game is entirely cooperative, and the dialogue has a revolutionary system where coop players or your companions can challenge your word and you have to either reason, charm, or intimidate them into your way of thinking through a simple game of rocks, papers scissors. Should you fail this mini game, it would be like losing the argument and being swayed to your companion or friend's idea, and you have to do something entirely different. It's incredibly interesting and mimics the real word, where sometimes things don't go as exactly planned or you don't always get your way.The game has depth. There's so much to sink your teeth into, and you can easily put in over 60+ hours if you want to complete each side quest while taking your time. The world is so rich that I find myself speaking to every single named NPC just to get their take on the land, hoping they may have a story to tell that may better my understanding for a quest, or have a new quest to give.Oh - and the speaking. The voice acting is absolutely fantastic. The lines are somewhat sparse as dialogue with NPCs is mostly text based, but when you hear characters speak, they're well voiced with enthusiasm and a wide array of voice actors. It's a game that every gamer who appreciates an RPG should experience. You owe it to yourself. If you're thinking about buying it, do it.			"

								First time playing the Divinity series and I know this is a far stretch from what the originals were BUT if you're an RPG fan and don't mind turn based combat (which works VERY well in this game). Then this is a must have. I've only clocked a few hours so far but the game is excellent, have only encounted one minor bug, that has to do with letters occasionally missing from the text. There's a lot of reading (on par with say Planescape torment or BG1 or 2) and just about everyone seems to have something to say. EVEN the animals (skill permitting) Highly recommend!  "

												A return to what made the cRPG genre great. If you are a fan of the older D&D titles, such as Pool of Radiance, the original Bard's Tale, and the Baulder's Gate/Icewind Dale series, then this game will scratch that itch. This title takes all the great things of the cRPG genre and updates to modern features where sensible, such as easy item transfer, character interaction, and character development, while keeping the older game play style and difficulty.

												Everything that's great about old school CRPGs is present in Divinity: OS. The simplest way to put it is this: if you pine for a modern RPG in the spirit of Baldur's Gate I and II, Icewind Dale, and the first two Fallout games, drop whatever crap game you're currently playing and pick this one up as soon as you can. The world is alive and every object serves a purpose. The level of interaction is on par with the Ultima series (VII and UO come to mind) -- perhaps even better. The combat is immersive, tactical, unpredictable, and plenty of fun. There's nothing quite like creating a poison cloud around your enemies and then loosing and fire arrow in the middle of the fray to watch them all explode and burn. And that's just one of the many element/environment combos you can pull off on a whim.It begins with a murder mystery (like Ultima VII). Buy it. It's that good.			"

												Like Baldurs Gate 2. Drops you into a rich world of exploration and discovery.Good humor from developers. Indepth skill trees.Having fun so far. Quest givers are not very helpful and are somewhat cryptic. As you explore the game you will eventually stumble upon the quests you have been assigned to complete. A bit annoying but given the linear nature of the game, you're bound to finish it if you try to explore all the caves, nooks and secret hiding spots. Morality is an interesting concept here... you don't really want to steal everything in sight because it's the fastest way towards getting murdered by the quite overpowered town guards.Paid $40, felt i got my money's worth given the quality and entertainment endured.

												So many of the younger persons have been so spoiled growing up playing nothing but Diablo-like click fests, that they have no patience for a well thought out and deeper RPG experience.Divinity: Original Sin, is throwback to the golden era of the cRPG. The age before Diablo's success spawned a new type of RPG with the most important element removed or given a back seat - THE STORY! Not to mention a watered down version of RPG combat - the button mash.This game is nostalgic. It leaves me with a good feeling just thinking about returning to the game, and experiencing it with the attention and thought that it was designed for. There is great attention to detail, the writing is excellent and humor a fun diversion, and the combat forces you to think instead of like pointing at a group of monsters and clicking them to death.This is what a real RPG game is all about! The developers did an excellent job with this.			"

												This is pretty much everything I could have wanted in a Baldur's Gate-style RPG. You can steal pretty much everything that isn't nailed down, but you can't do it when anyone is watching, lest they alert the guards. You can bash doors and chests open if you don't have a thief in your party. There are a number of classes in addition to the classic 4 (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief), but you can customize them to however you'd like them if you don't like what Larian offers. Turn based combat where the environment affects your spells (Shocking a nearby enemy while it's raining may have the desired effect of stunning them, but it may also arc and stun yourself too!) Quests have multiple ways to solve them, which is sort of necessary, as you're limited to two party members. Oh, and when two different people play the two characters? You can argue about the actions you take and your dialog choices can affect how other NPCs react to you and how well you can persuade them to do things they may not want to, via Intimidation, Charm, and appealing to Reason.I think my only real critique is that in combat, it's super easy to accidentally target something you didn't mean to and thus waste a turn, possibly to lethal outcomes.Overall, it's a fantastically fun game that takes the best parts of Planescape: Torment and Fallout 2. The competitive co-op is just icing on the cake.			"

Now even though i say i don't want to repeat the same stuff over again, this game gives an absolute crap load of freedom and is an amazing point and click RPG with turn based combat.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a slow paced RPG with an indepth dialogue for your characters and NPCs you bump into, or even just passing by.

												From what i can tell up to this point of my Playtrough, by far one of the best RPGs in the last years.If you like to spend hours upon hours reading trough story and dialog, this game might be just for you!It is heavily driven by story, like reading a book or playing a Pen & Paper RPG. if you like one of those you probably will have a lot of fun with this game! The first few Hours you will spend walking around Town, talking to people and gathering information and clues.There are no Questmarkes that show you where to go the whole time! So you will have to read what people tell you and use your brain.The Combat, at least in the first few levels is fairly challenging and can be quite rough.You can combine lots of items from your Inventory to craft new stuff out of it and so on.A complete recommendation from me for this game!

												167 Hours of coop gameplay.PROS:- Great story- COOP- The writing is superb! (except for a few misspellings like ""the chest of the souce king"" :P)- Believable NPC characters- Enjoyable sidequests (never did I feel like I did it for XP)- The enviroment is beautiful and plays a big role in combat- There are puzzles and secrets to discover- The sound and effect of skills and spells are satisfying and carries weight to it- Editor and MOD supportCONS:- Divinity: Original sins was designed for a specific camera rotation and angle. For those who wants 360 degree camera rotation; you would need to activate it in options. Doing so will let you see 2d foliage and other ""graphical anomalies"". (I had 360 on all the way, and did not mind too much)- Only three skillbars that totals 30 slots, when you can get 40+ skills with ease. Why stop at three?- Only the player that initiate dialogue with an NPC gets a propper chatwindow.CONCLUSION:I give it 9/10 and a game worth every penny!And I leave you with this:""CYYY-SEAAL CYYY-SEAAL, SHIVER ME TIMBERS AND SLITHER ME EELS!""

												Review @ 100 hours and level 18.<tl;dr>Despite having a few flaws this game is one of the most engaging for a long time, and worth the full asking price - don't wait for a sale, get it now!</tl;dr>My wife and I play this in LAN co-op mode, we bought this pre-release as we are fans of the genre but did not start playing until a few weeks after release to avoid the inevitable patch-aggrevation.To gauge whether you have a similar taste to us, we loved:- Baldur's Gate- Neverwinter Nights- Ultima series- Sacred 1 & 2- Diablo 1 & 2- Titan Quest- Eye of the Beholder- old-school Sierra Online & Lucasarts gamesAfter 200 collective hours of playing, we have not had a single crash (platform is Windows 8.1 x64) - this is noteworthy for modern games I think.The things we like most about the game:- the humour (at times subtle and possibly for older players, however)- the camera style (not first-person or over-the-shoulder)- the quests are not spoon-fed- you are free to develop your characters as you want (no forced classes)- ALT-tabbing works flawlessly and quicklyThings which have frustrated us at times, but not enough to dissuade from recommending the game:- mis-clicking during combat due to animation of a mob- the inventory UI does not feel polished (e.g. after dragging an item out of a container, clicking anywhere will be interpreted as a location for the character to move to)For the NPC dialogues we can look at whichever screen we need to, but I can imagine the passive player in a co-op game might feel a little lost or left out if not in the same room as the active player.We have had 1 quest which required a manual hack of a savegame to complete due to it disappearing entirely after selecting ""we'll talk about this later"" - luckily a quick Google showed us what to hex-edit trivially to reset the quest/NPC status.We have had no issues with performance, but our systems are not low-spec and not overclocked or bogged down with background processes - certainly no loading screens measured in minutes.It is good to know that the game uses 1 core 100% all the time, so having at least a quad core CPU is advisable, as well as plenty of RAM, a 64-bit OS, good cooling and no overclocking.

												Ok... This is a bold statement... and shouldn't be taken lightly. Divinity: Original Sin is the BEST RPG I've ever played. Nothing can touch it. It's also my GOTY, hands down. Rarely does a developer put so much of their love and affection into a game. Larian have, and by doing so, they've changed the game, maybe even the rulebook for every RPG that follows. This is the new benchmark, probably for any genre.Even if you don't like RPGs, D:OS will have something for you. Even if you're a casual gamer, it's so well paced, you could hop in for just half an hour at a time. But you wont. You'll be drawn into a beautiful, complex and vibrant world of adventure, mystery and more importantly FUN.D:OS won't hold your hand, or assume you're stupid. You can do ANYTHING from the get go. GO anywhere. This freedom isn't just limited to what you can do, it's how you do it. You're offered choices constantly, be it through clever dialogues with NPC's or gameplay itself. The game will know what you've done, who knows about it, and who it will effect and adjust itself accordingly.I'm not going to offer any spoilers here past the first hour. That would be morally bankrupt. The beauty of this game, is discovering it for yourself. D:OS doesn't stop you from doing what you want. You can treat people how you want, do quests any way you want and shape the story any way you want. This is role playing at it's finest. Actually *Playing a Role*. Want to be the bad guy with a penchant for stealing fine art from inns? Go ahead, or maybe you want to be the wordsmith that uses their charm and intellect to feed your cheese habit. Real freedom, and from it comes real fun.If it's there, you can interact with it. You can even do it in combat too...Combat... oh yeah! There's so much to do that isn't fighting, that I almost forgot! The combat in D:OS, is quite simply, the best turn-based combat system ever devised. I'm not even going to describe it. Words don't do it justice. The worst thing you can do, is ignore this game. It may 'look' like a generic RPG from screenshots, but once you're in, you're not getting out without loving it.One thing I wish could be implemented is controller support. Then, this game would be absolute perfection.10/10 Must buy.			"

												My relationship with this game brings me back to Dragon Age: Origins. I'm not an old school PC RPG player, so I don't have any stories about Baldur's Gate or Planescape. Regardless, this is probably the best RPG to be released since Origins and has captured more of my time than I can scarcely begin to understand. The gameplay lends itself to thought and thankfully doesn't hold your hand with quest markers, flickering trails to the next objective or obvious build decisions. If you're not a veteran of the genre the game is going to sock you in the face over and over again, but it feels so good when you do finally learn to dodge the punch. Encounters, especially with bosses, seem unfair at the outset when they pit your 2 to 4 man group up against 5, 6 or 7+ enemies. A little element mixing and ingenuity can see two turns tilt a battle in your favor or bad positioning have you reloading in a heartbeat. You can use mages to deal massive AOE damage by combining elements such as fire and poison for huge explosions or catering to a melee character with massive magic buffs to create a massive wrecking ball. There's a certain level of sarcasm and wit peppered into the dialogue along with pop culture references that can bring a smile to the face without really overwhelming. Good music, nice looking areas--it's definitely worthy of all of the great reviews it's been getting. In a few weeks I'll probably have a 100+ hours into this and I'll still be coming back for more. There's even frickin' multiplayer, with rock-paper-scissor arguements that can come up between players on how to handle quest decisions. If you don't have a friend you can set your AI partner's behavior and experience two main characters disagreeing. It's fantastic. Oh, you can rob entire towns blind, too.			"

Rewards inventive/smart ability and item usageRewards explorationArt direction is solid, lots of interesting environments and maintains a consistent level of quality even with its unconventionally saturated colour palette Writing is pretty good, relatively interesting universe/storylineWriting also tongue-in-cheek (though perhaps a little too often)NegativesThere are times when you will probably need a walkthrough to progress because it is not clear how to progress otherwiseCombat often devolves into elemental ♥♥♥♥♥torm for lack of a better termSome of the combat scenarios will become more of a routine of using the same skills in orderCharacter balance is a little awkward at times. Trying to go into multiple specialties does not seem very effective and my rogue character (especially the invisibility spell) seemed pretty overpowered in the early stages of the game  Minor GripesIdle animations can make properly selecting targets in combat a painNon-grid-based combat can be finicky at timesCrafting could have been fleshed out a lot moreAlthough it's mostly just the nature of the type of game it is, the RNG in the combat can definitely be frustratingOverall, Divinity is a fantastic game and one of the best I have played in its particular genre.

												This is definitely the best RPG I've played in years. The game has very little hand-holding and it makes you have to figure out stuff on your own. Quests aren't simply little exclamation points over character's heads, you don't have to necessarily run back to town to ""turn in"" a quest, you're not given a little point on a map for you to follow. This game wants you to become invested in its world, and invested I have definitely become. In most RPG's I've played recently I know the names of like, maybe 2 NPCs, because if I need to go to them for some reason the game will say, in capital letters, ""GO HERE AND TURN IN THIS SPECIFIC QUEST TO PROCEED."" This game doesn't do that, it's not its style.The first main quest in the game is essentially a murder mystery, which might not sound too amazing on paper, but it's a fantastic starting point in the game because it forces you to become invested in the world by talking to all of the NPC's, learning their relationships, collecting clues, etc... Your journal in the game recounts what you've learned, but it doesn't make any of the deductions for your, it's up to you, the player, to deduce who you think is the murderer.This type of quest design pervades throughout the game. If you play this game you may become a little frustrated at first because of how used current gamers are to having their hands held, but if you persevere (and please don't use a wiki) then you will find one of the most immersive and enjoyable games you'll ever play.

												The best RPG I've played in a very long time. The closest a video game can get to a pen and paper RPG, Chris and I spent our first 5 hours just wandering around town literally doing nothing but stealing paintings, talking to kittens, and occasionally massacring random villagers. There's a lot of humor, a million ways to play the game, great turn based combat that is definitely not overly easily or too hard. The co-op is the best I've seen in an RPG, you can each make independant decisions and actually have your characters argue ending in a game of rock paper scissors, the victor getting the final say. The game doesn't hold your hand at all, so expect to have to learn and be creative, just as you have to do in a pen and paper story. There's crafting thats entirely experimental that I can't find two online lists that have found all the same things because theres that much. It's classless so you can really make your own character who you want them to be. There's a huge long story to this game, but I've been completely satisfied with my purchase and excited for the rest of the game without even venturing very far from the first town. I highly recommend Divinity if you are a fan of RPGs.			"

												Ok, I don't review games to often. A game either has to be extremely good, or one you wish you could set fire too. So in a nutshell, is this game worth buying?  YesEven for £30? Take all my money!I bought this game in a sale, because I wasn't sure if It was my sort of thing. I like RPG type games, but it's not something I would spend a whole lot of time playing. Now yes I do have a rather low play time so far.. but in this very short amount of time, I can honestly say this is going to steal a whole lot of my hours. If they make more DLC, more missions, then i'm in.. even if I haven't finished the main campaign. The classes seem very well balanced, and theres so much control of what you can do. I'll update as I play through the game, but for now... YES, if you are a fan of this kind of game.. you will NOT go wrong. I'm playing with a friend at the moment, and we are both enjoying this very much.			"

												I backed the project through Kickstarter and I can say I am more than pleased.After a few hours of intense NON-combat questing in the town I solved a few quests in surprising ways, had disagreements with ""myself"" that lead to new friends or foes, skipped questlines by pickpocketing the right people, crafted my first gear and ventured out of town for my first big fights. There is enough content in the first town and surroundings to pass as a proper game these days and that is only scratching the surface. The implementation of co-op, the way that fights can play in turn-based mode while other party members venture the world in real time add another layer of depth and fun to the game. Together with  the classless system I am already contemplating which skill/ability combination I will try for my next playthrough !Highly recommended, a true RPG offering freedom, experimentation and challenge without holding your hand while never being obtuse or confusing.Highly recommended !

												I've had a lot of fun playing Divinity as it reminds me of time spent many years ago playing old school Bioware Infinity Engine RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale.  The engine, graphics, sound and production values are all triple-A quality (for a top-down RPG) which suprised me for a game that came out of a kickstarter campaign. The learning/difficulty curve seems about right (for a non-powergamer playing on normal), with the game being quite challenging at first but after a while the gradual pacing and steady level progression kept me wanting to play. Not to mention the decent exposition and story line that is well above par for the genre. The ""classless"" system works really well, providing a fair amount of freedom in shaping your source hunters throughout and allowing you to adapt playing style as you discover the magic and combat systems.  The turn based combat is really good, and will appeal to lovers of games like X-Com and Final Fantasy. Can't wait to try out co-op and highly recommend this game to RPG lovers.			"

Posted: January 12, 2015
												Divinity: Original Sin is wonderful.  From the serious characters to the quirky characters to the crafting and the combat, this game delivers on all counts.  Improving it would be difficult, though not entirely impossible.Two things I love about it: 1. Every battle presents some degree of challenge with few exceptions as the adversaries are equally matched to the playable characters.  Even a difference of one level can be devastating (e.g. a level 7 adversary tends to annihilate a level 6 party member).  This does bar access to some regions of the world, but it does so organically.  You can attempt it and fail or you could mark it on your map and return later.2. All of the skills (special attacks) gained remain useful throughout the game.  In many RPGs, the early skills become useless partway through and/or get replaced by upgraded versions.  In D:OS, they remain pertinent and never get replaced or outclassed by an upgraded version.  This is due to the skills scaling in effect as the characters progress improving their attributes and equipping superior weapons as well as to the old school combat system.  For instance, Minor Heal remains useful later on because its cooldown decreases as Intelligence increases and so, my healer could cast it every single turn by level 13.  I use it while Strong Regenerate cools down and out of combat to quickly recover the party.One thing of which to be aware: The game begins slowly and the beginning is not overly engaging.  It is a game that gets better as you play it which has pros and cons.  The pro is that it is wonderful as I said; the con, that many people give up on it early on.  Honestly, I did not play it for a while because it did not engage me as I am accustomed to games doing.  Give it a few hours and once you can leave Cyseal without being murdered by undead, you can really start enjoying it.			"

But we have hit the 9 hour mark and barely made a scratch at the content in the game. It wasn't till close to 6 hours that we even left Cyseal the starting city. The quests are done old school style where you do the work rather than go where it tells you to. The dialogs are a joy to read. Pet speaking is a must. I never knew talking to rats could be so enjoyable as well as hint filled. They mnight be the smartest creatures in this world. Overall great buy would recommend it to anyone who loves DND or hardcore RPGs not so much to those who like handholding.			"

SummaryA good game with some flaws and great cooperative play.GameplayGame features a simple yet powerful(tho still limited) and funny crafting system and you could completely ignore if you don't like crafting. Crafted items are comparable to found and sold by vendors ones.Combat is... well, almost perfect. AI is sometimes bugged, but devs constantly improve it. Main issue is lava - you could kill anything not invulnerable with it.Questing is fun, well written and diverse, however it seems last chapter was rushed till release as it contains a way less quests than 1&2 ones on bigger territory. Main story is bug-free, but some quests are uncompliteable at 2 & 3 chapters.Non-mage characters will probably face lack of different skills, while mages enjoy diverse and rich amount of spells, both harmful and helpful.ReplayabilityIn my opinion game features zero-to-none replayability cause there's no major game-changing choices you could make. Game is filled with plenty of minor ones but those only affect your end-game stats via so-called ""traits"" like compassionate or blunt.Co-opThe game is desinged for two players. Both of you could do everything, no limits, later on you'll be able to take control of additional henchmen. You could savely afk while your partner takes control of your character. Game poses options for you to play a rock-scissor-paper game when you can't agree on certain answer in dialogue.Last-battle You can't take evil side by killing Astarte. And tis battle is extremely easy even on hard, cause dragon is not immune to disables. Boring.  "

												Probably the closest you can get to playing Dungeons & Dragons as a video game, especially considering this one has online co-op! The only complaint I have is the randomised and imbalanced loot/vendor inventory system. It's a little 'too random'.			"

												Awesome game! Reminds me of good ol' Baldur's Gate. It's good to see the return of a classic turn-based RPG. Somewhat basic fantasy storyline but well told with a good plot twists. Do have one critique in that there could be a little more direction for the quests. Honestly, I checked online walkthroughs a few times because I was totally stumped. 3 thumbs up.			"

												This is the game I've been wishing for! A game that features an intricate battle system, a flexible leveling system, multiple ways to solve your quests, a well established world filled with enough lore to fill a library and then some, co-op, no handholding, a turn based isometric fantasy adventure, and lots of magical loot.If you like roleplaying or strategy or strategy roleplaying games you will enjoy this game.

												One of the best RPG games I have played in years.  Believe me for I play them all.  You'll get lost in exploration and your curiosity is always rewarded with intrigue, violence, comedy and victory.  No playthrough is the same.  Remember what it felt like to play a sandbox game your way and not their way?  Experience it again.  It's easily in my top 20 games of all time.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Get this game.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is an excellent CRPG.  As someone who spent far too much time playing Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment in my formative years, it's been far too long since I've had an RPG of this caliber on the PC.  The game looks amazing, combat is smooth, tactical, and a whole mess of fun, and the story is engaging.  Highly recommended.			"

								First time playing the Divinity series and I know this is a far stretch from what the originals were BUT if you're an RPG fan and don't mind turn based combat (which works VERY well in this game). Then this is a must have. I've only clocked a few hours so far but the game is excellent, have only encounted one minor bug, that has to do with letters occasionally missing from the text. There's a lot of reading (on par with say Planescape torment or BG1 or 2) and just about everyone seems to have something to say. EVEN the animals (skill permitting) Highly recommend!  "

												I didn't know what to expect when I initially started playing. I knew it was an RPG and a lot of people were hyping it as amazing. My very first impression was that it was clunky and awkward. I was barraged very quickly with all sorts of things to do and places to go it was almost overwhelmingly busy. In definitely wasn't intuitive for me at first. After a couple hours I started getting used to things and it actually started becoming a lot of fun. The more I play it, the better it seems to get. Within a couple hours it very enjoyable and I wasn't noticing any of things that were bothering me before. I'm not terribly far in at the point that I'm writing this, but I'm pretty thoroughly impressed by it and would definitely say it's worth a buy.The simplest way I could probably sum it up is as a cross between Baldur's Gate and Diablo, but it feels much more like the prior.

Early Access Review
								An intstant classic and a game made several years too late (where were you my whole life!?) Well, now it's finally going to release and I must say it's a very well made Ultima/Baulder's Gate styled game that will leave you doing random stuff for hours. Literally hours. I think that's the only bad quality of the game. You can play for eight hours straight and seemingly get nowhere. That was the charm of Ultima too, but in this case, for my life and where it is, I don't have the patience.The graphics are very good for the isometric portrayal of the game world, and the interactions with the environment are a welcome sight to see. Although the world feels alive, the people feel dull. Many of the villagers will not help you much with quests as they all say the same thing and do little in hinting you where to go next. That just adds to the hours spent meandering around doing nothing. While I love it when a game does not hold your hand it must try better at making you understand the world you are playing in. Otherwise I'd love to see more map markers for quests.Combat is highly rewarding. Finally we have a game where your tactical decisions mean a lot. I was expecting this from games like Dragon Age but that game never had the envronment as a tactic as much as this game does. Your characters matter, and a team of warriors will be ill prepared against magic while a team of rogues will die fast against a strong opponent. By using your partners to full effectiveness, it feels everyone has a place in the world.The loot and trading is awesome and makes the game feel very free and open. You can do anything you want. Lastly, the music and menu design is very well done. All things considered this is a really well built game, with deep lore to explore, allows you to do anything you want, and keeps you progressing as you play. But I will warn you: be prepared to sink a few hundred hours on your first playthrough (unaided) since a few quests can be a bit overmuch to explore.I'll also add, the first quests make it very slow to have multiple playthroughs of the game. If I were you I'd skip most of them just to get your playthroughs underway. Most of the stuff in the first town is talking and meandering and highly forgettable.			"

												Wow, this game is awesome. It harkens back to the days of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and Fallouts 1&2. This game is gorgeous at times. The UI is very intuitive, and all of the game's systems are easy to figure out without consulting guides or manuals (at least for someone familiar with this type of game.)The drop-in co-op is implemented very well. The only gripe I have is your partner doesn't create their own characters to use in your game; they play the ones you assign them that you've created. Not a big deal at all.Also, I've run into a few bugs in the game, but nothing that has impeded my progress.I heartily recommend this game for any old school turn-based RPG fans... or just RPG fans who want to play a great game.

												Everything that's great about old school CRPGs is present in Divinity: OS. The simplest way to put it is this: if you pine for a modern RPG in the spirit of Baldur's Gate I and II, Icewind Dale, and the first two Fallout games, drop whatever crap game you're currently playing and pick this one up as soon as you can. The world is alive and every object serves a purpose. The level of interaction is on par with the Ultima series (VII and UO come to mind) -- perhaps even better. The combat is immersive, tactical, unpredictable, and plenty of fun. There's nothing quite like creating a poison cloud around your enemies and then loosing and fire arrow in the middle of the fray to watch them all explode and burn. And that's just one of the many element/environment combos you can pull off on a whim.It begins with a murder mystery (like Ultima VII). Buy it. It's that good.			"

If you are a fan of the older D&D titles, such as Pool of Radiance, the original Bard's Tale, and the Baulder's Gate/Icewind Dale series, then this game will scratch that itch. This title takes all the great things of the cRPG genre and updates to modern features where sensible, such as easy item transfer, character interaction, and character development, while keeping the older game play style and difficulty.

												This is pretty much everything I could have wanted in a Baldur's Gate-style RPG. You can steal pretty much everything that isn't nailed down, but you can't do it when anyone is watching, lest they alert the guards. You can bash doors and chests open if you don't have a thief in your party. There are a number of classes in addition to the classic 4 (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief), but you can customize them to however you'd like them if you don't like what Larian offers. Turn based combat where the environment affects your spells (Shocking a nearby enemy while it's raining may have the desired effect of stunning them, but it may also arc and stun yourself too!) Quests have multiple ways to solve them, which is sort of necessary, as you're limited to two party members. Oh, and when two different people play the two characters? You can argue about the actions you take and your dialog choices can affect how other NPCs react to you and how well you can persuade them to do things they may not want to, via Intimidation, Charm, and appealing to Reason.I think my only real critique is that in combat, it's super easy to accidentally target something you didn't mean to and thus waste a turn, possibly to lethal outcomes.Overall, it's a fantastically fun game that takes the best parts of Planescape: Torment and Fallout 2. The competitive co-op is just icing on the cake.			"

												Original Early Access review:This is shaping up to be a really enjoyable RPG. It has a fun story and the combat is engaging and mostly deterministic. I've played about 20 hours, and I think I've exhausted the currently available alpha content. I'd like to have an option for a free rotating camera; since everything seems to be fully 3d modeled, I don't see any technical reason not to. It would also be nice to have dialog choices somewhere in between ""I hate you and want you to die"" and ""I love you, let me be your slave forever"". Aside from a few small bugs and the above issues, I have no complaints about the game. Definitely worth buying, even if they release the other 80% of the game without fixing any of the issues.Release update:The game is still very worth buying. I haven't noticed any of the bugs that I experienced in early access now that it has been released. I'm playing multiplayer now and it is loads of fun. Co-operating with a friend adds a whole new dimension to combat. Text chat works well, athough text chat is inherently clunky for this kind of game. I'd reccommend being on skype or teamspeak to play with a friend or three. An option for a free rotating camera has been added (I love you for this Larian Studios) with the caveat that the main compaign wasn't intended to be view from the unlocked angles. I haven't noticed any artifacts yet, but I'm incredibly pleased to have the option even if I did see them.Minor griefs:The only bug (new; nothing that I saw in EA still exists) that has bothered me is that walking on environmental surfaces seems to tick the environmental damage way too many times. Zombies can walk across their own secreted poision to heal to full and one of my party members walking across a single meter of poision surface might take 5x 10-15 damage ticks and end up almost dead. The multiplayer chat window makes it a bit tough for both players to keep up with the story when only one player gets to see the dialogue play out in the large font, high contrast window (and view what can be said instead of only what is said). I initially had trouble getting my friend's companion to bind back to him when reloading; it turns out that companions are configured with the first button on the esc menu. The dialogue options are still very binary, the same as they were during early access. Overall:The game plays a lot like D&D (4th ed? no daily limits on spells for spellcasters in this) for the computer. If you like D&D then you will probably like Divinity: Original Sin.New campaigns and mods from the dev tools will only make D:OS better.The overall experience is phenomenal. Grab a friend and start playing.			"

NPC's show lots of personality, whether or not they repeat the same lines over and over. Dos allows you to interact with the environment. For example, if a wooden barricade is blocking your path, you can shoot fire at it, then make it rain to diffuse the fire to continue walking your original path. No game can be perfect, and DoS is no exception. Early progression can be difficult and long, and people that dislike turn based combat will likely dislike the combat sequences in the game.

												First of all, I loved Divine Divinity and I waited long for its spiritual sequel and if anybody who reads this felt the same -	 Divinity Original Sin  IS this sequel. With a playtime of almost 20 hours, i didn't even get to the second map, I mean this game is HUGE! The combat is turn-based, everything else is real-time with a transition between combat and exploring.In all points, it is a upgrade to its predecessor: + a extensive crafting system + beautiful landscapes (although the texture quality could be better) + humor (a underestimated quality in games) + completely unrestricted skillsystem (a rogue attacking with close-combat mageskills, totally possible!) + many objects are destructable, movable AND you can ""borrow"" them. :) + the elemental system! (cover enemies in oil and light them on fire, then make it rain and freeze them. Only one example.) + Well, I'm done here, play the game, find a few points for yourself, be surprised.There is only one downside, most of the dialogs are not voiced, so there's a lot to read. (In case you want to follow the story)Other negative points, as descripted in the ""negative reviews"" section, are also partially true, but in my opinion these are minor setbacks for an otherwise great game.10/10 would play again, oh wait, I'm not done yet.

												Like Baldurs Gate 2. Drops you into a rich world of exploration and discovery.Good humor from developers. Indepth skill trees.Having fun so far. Quest givers are not very helpful and are somewhat cryptic. As you explore the game you will eventually stumble upon the quests you have been assigned to complete. A bit annoying but given the linear nature of the game, you're bound to finish it if you try to explore all the caves, nooks and secret hiding spots. Morality is an interesting concept here... you don't really want to steal everything in sight because it's the fastest way towards getting murdered by the quite overpowered town guards.Paid $40, felt i got my money's worth given the quality and entertainment endured.

												Everything that's great about old school CRPGs is present in Divinity: OS. The simplest way to put it is this: if you pine for a modern RPG in the spirit of Baldur's Gate I and II, Icewind Dale, and the first two Fallout games, drop whatever crap game you're currently playing and pick this one up as soon as you can. The world is alive and every object serves a purpose. The level of interaction is on par with the Ultima series (VII and UO come to mind) -- perhaps even better. The combat is immersive, tactical, unpredictable, and plenty of fun. There's nothing quite like creating a poison cloud around your enemies and then loosing and fire arrow in the middle of the fray to watch them all explode and burn. And that's just one of the many element/environment combos you can pull off on a whim.It begins with a murder mystery (like Ultima VII). Buy it. It's that good.			"

												A return to what made the cRPG genre great. If you are a fan of the older D&D titles, such as Pool of Radiance, the original Bard's Tale, and the Baulder's Gate/Icewind Dale series, then this game will scratch that itch. This title takes all the great things of the cRPG genre and updates to modern features where sensible, such as easy item transfer, character interaction, and character development, while keeping the older game play style and difficulty.

												This is pretty much everything I could have wanted in a Baldur's Gate-style RPG. You can steal pretty much everything that isn't nailed down, but you can't do it when anyone is watching, lest they alert the guards. You can bash doors and chests open if you don't have a thief in your party. There are a number of classes in addition to the classic 4 (Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Thief), but you can customize them to however you'd like them if you don't like what Larian offers. Turn based combat where the environment affects your spells (Shocking a nearby enemy while it's raining may have the desired effect of stunning them, but it may also arc and stun yourself too!) Quests have multiple ways to solve them, which is sort of necessary, as you're limited to two party members. Oh, and when two different people play the two characters? You can argue about the actions you take and your dialog choices can affect how other NPCs react to you and how well you can persuade them to do things they may not want to, via Intimidation, Charm, and appealing to Reason.I think my only real critique is that in combat, it's super easy to accidentally target something you didn't mean to and thus waste a turn, possibly to lethal outcomes.Overall, it's a fantastically fun game that takes the best parts of Planescape: Torment and Fallout 2. The competitive co-op is just icing on the cake.			"

It has crafting, turn based combat and brillant magic system that rivals the game Magicka.TL/DR - If you are RPG fan then you can't miss this title.			"

								So i haven't played alot of this game, only due to the fact save games keep getting wiped. Absolutely understandable though, i've been holding out until official release to delve into it so i don't keep repeating the same stuff over again. Now even though i say i don't want to repeat the same stuff over again, this game gives an absolute crap load of freedom and is an amazing point and click RPG with turn based combat.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a slow paced RPG with an indepth dialogue for your characters and NPCs you bump into, or even just passing by. Not to mention the multiplayer i haven't played yet but cannot wait to argue decisions with a friend on our journey.Buy this game!			"

												Do you long for the days of yore? The bygone era of endless rpg's that would immerse you and make you lose all track of time?Games that would let you decide the way to play, the way to react and the actual outcome of the game's story? The days that games that would let you get through those long, cold and wet winters when no child (friend or foe) could be found roaming the neighborhood? No need to dream about the past any longer: Divinity: Original Sin is an ode to those glory days, when RPG's could immerse and entice you so deeply that you would look up after 3 months of playing and ask yourself; How long have I been away from society? Do my friends still know my name? Are my parents still alive? And the most important question of all; Why haven't I finished this game yet?If anything of the above sounds familiar, pleasant or ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME; GO BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥RIGHT NOW!			"

												Original Early Access review:This is shaping up to be a really enjoyable RPG. It has a fun story and the combat is engaging and mostly deterministic. I've played about 20 hours, and I think I've exhausted the currently available alpha content. I'd like to have an option for a free rotating camera; since everything seems to be fully 3d modeled, I don't see any technical reason not to. It would also be nice to have dialog choices somewhere in between ""I hate you and want you to die"" and ""I love you, let me be your slave forever"". Aside from a few small bugs and the above issues, I have no complaints about the game. Definitely worth buying, even if they release the other 80% of the game without fixing any of the issues.Release update:The game is still very worth buying. I haven't noticed any of the bugs that I experienced in early access now that it has been released. I'm playing multiplayer now and it is loads of fun. Co-operating with a friend adds a whole new dimension to combat. Text chat works well, athough text chat is inherently clunky for this kind of game. I'd reccommend being on skype or teamspeak to play with a friend or three. An option for a free rotating camera has been added (I love you for this Larian Studios) with the caveat that the main compaign wasn't intended to be view from the unlocked angles. I haven't noticed any artifacts yet, but I'm incredibly pleased to have the option even if I did see them.Minor griefs:The only bug (new; nothing that I saw in EA still exists) that has bothered me is that walking on environmental surfaces seems to tick the environmental damage way too many times. Zombies can walk across their own secreted poision to heal to full and one of my party members walking across a single meter of poision surface might take 5x 10-15 damage ticks and end up almost dead. The multiplayer chat window makes it a bit tough for both players to keep up with the story when only one player gets to see the dialogue play out in the large font, high contrast window (and view what can be said instead of only what is said). I initially had trouble getting my friend's companion to bind back to him when reloading; it turns out that companions are configured with the first button on the esc menu. The dialogue options are still very binary, the same as they were during early access. Overall:The game plays a lot like D&D (4th ed? no daily limits on spells for spellcasters in this) for the computer. If you like D&D then you will probably like Divinity: Original Sin.New campaigns and mods from the dev tools will only make D:OS better.The overall experience is phenomenal. Grab a friend and start playing.			"

												A very solid game overall - a must-buy if you're a fan of old-school cRPGs. The turn-based combat system is extremely deep and (especially in co-op mode) seems to help in making the combat not feel like a chore. It does have issues: often times it'll be hard to see where the edges of ground effects (fire, poison, etc.) are, especially if they're covered by grass. This has resulted in my characters taking unnecessary damage more times than I can count. Often times your character's vision will also be blocked for no reason, which can be frustrating. However, these issues are only minor and I expect they will be patched out in the near future.The story is engaging and the quests are mostly interesting, but unfortunately (or fortunately if you're like me) there's barely any voice acting. That is forgivable, though, as the game has a gigantic amount of dialogue. If you like reading, just buy the game already!One additional point I must bring up is the fact that the game starts off in a slow-ish manner. My friend and I were not very impressed by the combat system at the very beginning of the game, but it gets SO MUCH better after a few hours once you start getting more and more abilities to play around with.To summarize: the game is very good, but not perfect. 100% recommended if you're into cRPGs, otherwise you might want to read around a bit more to make sure that the game is for you.

												This game is amazingly comprised with turn based fighting, tons of story, and hours of collecting loot. This is not a fast game by any means for me. Very chill and a good sound track to go with it. Main tip i would give is learn the rewards for level system, just a quick over view. It will show you that you need to level up with meaning and don't expect to master everything with any one person. Specialize with your 4 characters and plan ahead. Also there is a way to get extra ability/attribute points for each level, don't want to spoil here but know there is more you can get.			"

												If you enjoy RPG's with turn based combat this will be your game of the year. Comes with a very flexible creation tool kit after release for modding or creating your own beautiful campaigns, stories, and crazy stuff. Music is beautiful and the co-op works wonderful. This game is twice as good if you have a friend to play it with but you can set the AI to play the 2nd character if you wish. Take note there is not hand holding on quests you will need use smart thinking clear them.Did I mention you can pick up a skill to talk to animals?			"

												Amazing game, I was glued to my screen the first few days after I bought this game.Music: original, incredible, love the main theme.Graphics: A lot better than you would expect from an indie game, though it warmed up my GPU faster than I would have expected.Gameplay: Love the storyline, lots of sidequests, choices, free world, the only downside is everyonce in a while the entire progress of a quest hinges on you finding one button. Some quests had a very original way of solving them. I was stumped quite a few times, sometimes even hours on a puzzle, but when you solve them, it is extremely satisfactory. Using a walkthrough will reduce your enjoyment of this game a lot. As they hint themselves though: unless you are the most careful player in the world, save often. Bugs: Encountered 1 bug in my entire playthrough. It was annoying, but since the game has 10 autosaves standard(up to 25), it was pretty easy to just load one, which fixed the situation.Overall: Definitely in my top 10 list of Steam games I have ever played. If you are a D&D/pathfinder/.. player, you will love the open world, choices, consequences. 9/10			"

												Note: I only review when I finish the game.Divinity: Original Sin is one of the best games I ever played. The game is so vast, so much rich of content. A huge world where you can do so many things in many different ways, like crafting, blacksmithing, customize your skin, solve riddles, negotiate itens, make your build etc. etc. etc. The story is beautiful and well developed, it has so much to do with the things I like to read. The battle system is smart, but sometimes it prolongs, and there isn't so much action, it needs more reasoning. The game isn't perfect, it has its bugs, but the positive points makes me forget them.

												Divine Divinity was first game I have ever bought many years ago. On release date of Original Sin I grabbed its Collectors Edition to play with my girlfriend - I think no game before hypnotised her that much, what's recommendation in itself. D:OS is truly great as is, yet there are areas it could shine even brighter (better journal, out-of-the-box 4 player co-op and more voicovers for NPCs are the ones I miss the most). If I were to recommend only one game this year, I would choose D:OS without hint of hesitation.			"

												Loved the game to start, reminded me of old school RPGs with a modern twist.But the more I play the more I love this game.  Each fight is different, and situational awareness is key.  The conversations are fun and not dry, the graphics are slick.  And it's a steam workshop game too for modders, as well as nexus.			"

												To put it briefly:If you like Baldur's Gate or PlaneScape:Torment or the XCom series and games like them, then you'll probably like this game.If you're expecting Diablo, then don't get Divinity: Original Sin.This game does not have quest markers, doesn't have highlights of where to go and what to say, and it won't give you an obvious crafting system.You can play it like a mindless killing machine and pretend it's Diablo, but then you'll be missing what I think are the best parts.To craft, you find books which give you ""recepies"". They will go to an easily accessible list, but it will be in the form of ""When trying to survive in the wild, I think a couple of branches are priceless. They can be made into a make-shift spear, staff or even a make-shift dagger.""You can also try to use common sense and discover crafting formulas on your own, if your character has enough crafting skill of course.Basically, the game expects you to read the lore, and to think for yourself when trying to both survive combat and solve the various puzzles.Regarding the difficulty levels of the game:I've put in hundreds of hours in all the XCom games, all Civilization games, all Fallout games, Baldur's Gate, PlaneScape:Torment, and I love those kinds of slow tactical and strategic games.I don't know if I just got lucky with my skill choices, or it was because of the games I've played, but I started on normal, and thought it wasn't that bad.Sure, at first I got killed several times until I started to understand how I should play the game... and after that point, it wasn't that hard anymore.The encounters don't normally scale with your level, but there are a few cases where I've seen them scale, but that might have been because I attacked friendlies for extra XP (whoops!).After some 30 hours of play, I joined a multiplayer session which was set to Hard, and I didn't notice it was on the Hard difficulty level.My point: If you like tactical games, you'll learn how to play the game. You can still go too far, too soon and be in a very tough situation... which you can still win by outsmarting your opponents...			"

												This game is awesome. Bringing me back to my roots with memories of banging my head against the wall getting through Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 as a teen. Minor issues here or there do not detract from an overall amazing experience. The challenge is spot on and reading comprehension is a must, as well as strategic decision making. Highly recommend.

								This is honestly the best strategy rpg that I have played set in the fantasy realm since Final Fantasy Tactics.  The environmental effects are mind blowing, the art style lovely, and even the storytelling is pretty decent.  Nevertheless, it is the combat system at the end of the day that takes the cake, as the gameplay is like pen and paper virtualized.  Would I recommend this game, absolutely.			"

												Overall I have been very pleased with this game.  I played the original BG and NW series, Icewind Dale my favorite.  This game brings a lot of those rpg and turned-based 4-person squad elements with a fresh take on the open world / roaming environment that feels similar to playing the Ultima series for me. I'm not very far at the time of this post, maybe 15+ hours, and I've enjoyed every moment of it.The graphics are easy on the eye at ultra settings on a modest machine.  It defaulted to those on a AMD FX 6300 / Radeon 6800. UI is pretty standard as the come.  The only thing is the, rather important, button on the right which is how you teleport.  Wish that one was more evident... sadly responsible for 30 mins of my play time.The way you can split you party is very cool imo.  At one point one of my two main characters was about to die in combat on the next round (surrounded).  If both of your two main characters die you lose and load. (lots of f5/f8)  I fled with my other main character and one side character back to town and was able to regroup in real time while my other main character stayed in combat awiting their return.  I ran the other two back into the fight and was able to prevent his death.  While some may see this as a cheap way out or breaking game mechanics there is also the possibility that those returning character run into another mob and I would have two seperate battles to wage, or manage to merge them back into one.  Your characters have conversations with the party that you control. Doesn't really have a place in the SP mode (although it does change stats in some cases) and you can turn it off in the options but in MP mode it comes into play as if you don't agree with the person your playing with you can argue and try to intimiate/charm/reason with them.  And finally a draw will bring rock-paper-scissors to decide it all.  Another new element that I am indifferent on but for the record have yet to play multi.Crafting is a nice addition.  You learn your recipes by book reading and from there it's a drag-and-drop process mostly.  However keeping all the ingredients can get messy in the inventory.      Soudtrack is quite enjoyable and the audio is well done.  VOs are ok, but honestly very few make it immersive.  The main story is not bad so far but I've been bouncing all over the place with side quests and have much more to do. It's one of those ""what's over there?"" games that makes you hate the next day at work from lack of sleep.  I would give it a 9 or 10.  I bought it at $40, I'd do it again.			"

												I am giving this game a thumbs up with a few caveats.  It is almost the gold standard for RPG of this kind.  It is well worth the money, I got 87 hours out of it and I didn't even complete everything.  It is a lot of fun and is a dynamic world.  For example in most games where you see backdrops of crates you can't interact with, in this game you can.  You can move them or set them on fire.  A door locked and can't find the key?  Bash or burn it down if you like.Anyway,  I would strongly reccomend that you wait at least 3 months after this game is released to buy it for the following reasons.  By this time I sure hope there are good walk-though guides available.The quests in this game are very old-school.  They do not give you a lot of hints and there in no guidance in the least.  Some of them may require that you find hidden switches and hit them in the right order.  You will not know how many hidden switches there are.  You might find three of them and try all combos and nothing happens.  Well you need to find the 4th switch and try again... maybe find the 5th one?One quest requires you to find a hidden object, this is a main quest so you have to do it.  This object is ""somewhere"" in a large forest.  You need a perception of like 12 to ""see"" it.  Stats are very precious and you generally are not going to be able to pump perception as other stats are FAR more important.   The only way I solved it was by finding a screen shot of the locaiton, then moving my character there, putting on all +perception gear I could find, and THEN drank a super preception potion and FINALLY I could ""see"" this huge mound of dirt that had the item I needed.It is stuff like this that pisses me off and really takes away from this game.  I would really like to know if people find stuff like this naturally without guides.  Other than stuff like that, this is a great game.			"

												I didn't hear of this game until shortly before its release, but when I saw it in the Steam Sale and watched some gameplay videos of it I was instantly interested in it. An old-school RPG with turn-based combat, a well thought-through spell system (poison + fire = explosion, water/blood + electricity = stun, hitting puddles with fireballs makes them steam clouds, steam clouds + electricity = stun clouds and much, much more) and a huge, very detailed world with many secrets to discover make this game the best game I have played this year so far. I've heard people criticize the lack of a 100% voice-over, but Fallout 2 didn't have complete voice-overs and is considered one of the best RPGs up to this day.The negative points I have are these:- more or less bland companions. You don't get to know a lot about them, and both are only relevant for one or two quests overall, but depending on how you chose your main character's classes they complement your party very well. If you want to play ""alone"" (ie. only with your 2 main characters, there is an extra perk for that as well)- the story could have had better pacing. For the first half of the game the story makes total sense, you are investigating an outbreak of undeads and some other things on the side, and then suddenly everything gets overthrown and for a while you are left wondering what is going on. Luckily this gets cleared up shortly after, but it was still a little confusing in the beginning- the fights in the beginning of the game start out extremely challenging, but lose the intensity later-on as more of your characters can learn healing spells and have high resistances gainst the spell schools etc.. - also, money inflation is a problem. In the beginning you never have enough money, but after ~15h played I had so much money I traded items with vendors for free just to get them out of my inventoryHowever, these negative points are far outweighed by the positive aspects of this game, and it has been a long time since I put 65h+ into game in such a short time (the last game was Skyrim, and only due to mods that I spent so much time with it).If you like RPGs and you are not put off by turn-based combat or lack of complete voice-over then this is a must buy!

												Divinity Original Sin is one very impressive title. Voted number #1 for 2014 by quite a few online media sites. And we could not agree more. Never before have we been such fans of a turn-based RPG. Original Sin is a must-have. For those are are eagerly awating the Linux build from Larian, note it's on the way. Our last update from Larian regarding the native build is ""when it's done"". :-) We have to give props to the development team for taking time in porting the game, Larian is known for releasing stable gameplay, even in alpha and beta builds. Therefore we have a huge appreciation for the team taking their time to maintain their originality and creativity.			"

												It's been a long time since I've played an old school RPG of this quality. I highly recommend it to RPG fans! Here is my breakdown:THINGS THIS GAME DOES RIGHTCustomization - Instead of setting the length and thickness of your character's nose, you get options that matter, like choosing skills, talents, and stats which add up to make your own custom class. Of course, you can pick from a default list and build it however you want if you prefer. This is customization done right.Difficulty - This game will kill you. It's not Dark Souls hard, but it's hard enough to give you a sense of satisfcation when overcomingits challenges.Non-linearity - Aspects of this game are non-linear. Ultimately it does have a linear narrative, but you can almost completely freely explore the world. You're limited mostly by your level, which is the main barrier limiting progression.Grinding - Most RPGs allow you (or force you) to gain excessive amounts of experience to out-level the game's content. That is the fundamental principle of the JRPG. This game only gives you enough experience to survive the next challenge which ensures that the difficulty of the game is more fine tuned and harder to trivialize.Puzzles - Not everything is explicitly a puzzle. Sometimes advancing the story is a puzzle in itself (like the old adventure games). Sometimes a combat has puzzle elements. Sometimes it's just a room full of traps. Either way, there's almost always a problem to figure out.THINGS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT LIKESpeed of Play - This is a slow methodical game best spent enjoyed at a leisurely pace. The turn based combat, sprawling maps, and slower paced movement speed means that it'll take hours to progress through what some may consider a small amount of content. For the perceptive and the patient, though, that content has a lot to offer.Tone - It's a fairly straight forward fantasy setting. It's fun, whimsical, and self aware at times. It doesn't get overly dark nor overly comical. It's not too geneteric or creative. It serves primarily as a backdrop for the gameplay.Co-op Dialogue - You can do rock-paper-scissors to overcome disagreements. What you choose impacts your stats in small ways. Min-maxers beware. Everyone else; have fun.Random Loot - This has pros and cons. On the one hand, each playthrough is different. On the otherhand, a lot of loot sucks. It's debatable whether or not random loot works in a game with a limited pool of enemies.Nietzsche - He can join your party. It's pretty neat if you're in to that sort of thing. The devs didn't actually name him Nietzsche, but you'll figure it out if you went through that phase in your teen years.THINGS YOU PROBABLY WONT LIKEOops - It can be easy to make it hard or impossible to progress in the game by killing an NPC, letting them get killed, or just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them off enough. Same goes for accidently clicking on an object or walking into a room that causes the entire town to aggro on you. Save often.Bugs - There's still quite a number of bugs, but they are very quickly being addressed. Still, be warned. Save often.			"

												Short and sweet:I did not play the other Divinity titles, and I'm not one to play Dungeons and Dragons in real life, though I can understand the appeal. That being said Divinity: Original Sin (DOS) is hands down the best RPG I've played in recent years from a gameplay perspective. I'd recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the RPG genre, as it will not let you down. I've taken my first taste of a Divinity title and now all I want is more; with more multiplayer components and systems that support 4-player (or even 6-8 players) out of the box.The turn-based gameplay is absolutely perfect; the classes (that you can completely customize yourself) are diverse and fun to play, leaving a lot of replay value in the game although the campaign itself is massive enough alone. Graphically the game looks great and after a quick graphic-streaming fix in the game files it ran seamlessly at 144FPS 2560x1440 resolution.I'd heavily recommend a decent 4-player mod or 4-player edit as with 4 people the game is even more fun; though by itself it would still offer people a good experience. Even with the massive content rich evnironment myself and all those I know who love this game are left craving more; different campaigns from the communities and DLC from the developers bringing us new campaigns!

												9.5 out of 10. Fantastic Game. As an avid Divinity Fan since Divine Divinity, I was excited when I first found out that Larian was going to release another Divinity Game. I played all the Divinity Games from Divine Divinity to Dragon Commander. It is very deserving to be Game of the Year.  I enjoyed this game as much as I enjoyed Skyrim when it came out. Pros: Excellent Turn-Base Combat: Ability to use your enviroment against your enemy is very unheard of in most RPG and how each monster has a specific weakness to a specific type of damage whether it be magical or phyiscally. It's a blast to expierment on what does more damages to what specific group of monsters. And a battle could be in your enemies favor one time and next it's in your favor. Same applies to them. Longvity of a game: So many quests to do, I don't even think I completed all the quests in my 140 hours of playing this game. Excellent StoryHumorous: Especially when you meet Bellegar. Character Interaction, to actually be able to interact with every character and barter with each one actually made me feel like I was really in the world, but I expected nothing less as all the Divinity series aside from Dragon Commanderr had that. No Class Roles: You may have to pick a class to start out with but you don't need to follow the layout. I started out as a Wizard but decided to turn into a Battlemage. Replayablity: Replaying a different class after finishing the game adds so much more replay value. Co-Op: It's so fun to play with a friend, I played with my ex when we were still together and we had a blast playing. Exploration: So much to explore and I highly recommend you explore each and every place of this game you can find secrets, new quests and even legendary items. Music: One Word: Masterpiece Kirill Pokrovsky who is the composer of all the Divinity Music is a master at his art. The music is so blended perfectly with the game and it's atmosphere that it really adds a whole new layer of depth to the game. I could listen to this soundtrack so much and never get tired of it. Cons:The only con I can think of is I wish crafting was more in depth, and more recipes. Crafting seemed pretty non-existing to me while I played and I only used it to craft magic lock. Better armormaking and weaponsmithing would be nice. Still a fantastic game and has overtaken Divine Divinity and Dragon Knight as my favorite Divinity games.  Buy it and play it especially with a friend, the cooperation part really makes this game so much fun. Side Note: Those who complain about the difficulty of this game, sure it is difficult to begin with but it's really easy to get stronger and beat even the most diffiicult battles. With so many quests to do especially without leaving the main city you can easily get to the level you need to be to fight the mobs you see. I know it was hard for me but after some questing and gearing up, I was able to compete against the mobs and if that's not your cup of tea you can always turn the difficulty down. And make sure you grab two more companions in Cyseal before adventuring out, unless you're doing lone wolf build.			"

												My GOTY 2014, has been a while since we got such a great RPG since The Witcher 1.The general gist of the game is that it will not hold your hands much, and you are free to explore and discover. Combat will have you toy around with the environment and different spells and is the highlight of the game. Cut your opponent and electrify the pool of blood he's now standing in or teleport a barrel of goop onto a burning fiend for extra damage. Get this game.			"

												This just might be the best RPG I've played in the past decade.It's been a very long while since any game could measure up to games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape, Fallout (not 3) or Arcanum and I was beginning to think those kind of games wouldn't ever be created again. But then D:OS came out and proved me wrong. It really deserves a spot among the best RPG's ever. (Unless you don't like games that don't take themselves too seriously. Larian always puts in a fairly large amount of sillyness, which is I personally like. But it might not be for everyone.)			"

												Very difficult and stressful, Takes an incredible amount of time to progress. Still my favorite game to play right now.It does however fall short on multiplayer, only allowing one other friend to acompany you on your turn bassed adventure, however there are mods that allow you or two other friends to play as one of the various npc characters. Of course id rather play as my own but i didnt mind too much as the attiude and character of the npc's are great and its easy to pick a favorite. Highly recomended if yoou have the time.			"

												I backed the project through Kickstarter and I can say I am more than pleased.After a few hours of intense NON-combat questing in the town I solved a few quests in surprising ways, had disagreements with ""myself"" that lead to new friends or foes, skipped questlines by pickpocketing the right people, crafted my first gear and ventured out of town for my first big fights. There is enough content in the first town and surroundings to pass as a proper game these days and that is only scratching the surface. The implementation of co-op, the way that fights can play in turn-based mode while other party members venture the world in real time add another layer of depth and fun to the game. Together with  the classless system I am already contemplating which skill/ability combination I will try for my next playthrough !Highly recommended, a true RPG offering freedom, experimentation and challenge without holding your hand while never being obtuse or confusing.Highly recommended !

												This game is well worth the price of £30 on the steam store. The graphics are amazing, the skills are amazing, the combat is amazing and the game doesnt spoon feed you like your 5 so buy the game if u feel grown up enough, it aint for little children who need waypoints to everything and you actually need to read the quest description and ask around town to find out where you gotta go and what u gotta do.This game is even better in co-op so find a friend who owns it or persuade them to buy it and enjoy one of the best co op games in a very long time.

SummaryA good game with some flaws and great cooperative play.GameplayGame features a simple yet powerful(tho still limited) and funny crafting system and you could completely ignore if you don't like crafting. Crafted items are comparable to found and sold by vendors ones.Combat is... well, almost perfect. AI is sometimes bugged, but devs constantly improve it. Main issue is lava - you could kill anything not invulnerable with it.Questing is fun, well written and diverse, however it seems last chapter was rushed till release as it contains a way less quests than 1&2 ones on bigger territory. Main story is bug-free, but some quests are uncompliteable at 2 & 3 chapters.Non-mage characters will probably face lack of different skills, while mages enjoy diverse and rich amount of spells, both harmful and helpful.ReplayabilityIn my opinion game features zero-to-none replayability cause there's no major game-changing choices you could make. Game is filled with plenty of minor ones but those only affect your end-game stats via so-called ""traits"" like compassionate or blunt.Co-opThe game is desinged for two players. Both of you could do everything, no limits, later on you'll be able to take control of additional henchmen. You could savely afk while your partner takes control of your character. Game poses options for you to play a rock-scissor-paper game when you can't agree on certain answer in dialogue.Last-battle You can't take evil side by killing Astarte. And tis battle is extremely easy even on hard, cause dragon is not immune to disables. Boring.  "

												Short and sweet:I did not play the other Divinity titles, and I'm not one to play Dungeons and Dragons in real life, though I can understand the appeal. That being said Divinity: Original Sin (DOS) is hands down the best RPG I've played in recent years from a gameplay perspective. I'd recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the RPG genre, as it will not let you down. I've taken my first taste of a Divinity title and now all I want is more; with more multiplayer components and systems that support 4-player (or even 6-8 players) out of the box.The turn-based gameplay is absolutely perfect; the classes (that you can completely customize yourself) are diverse and fun to play, leaving a lot of replay value in the game although the campaign itself is massive enough alone. Graphically the game looks great and after a quick graphic-streaming fix in the game files it ran seamlessly at 144FPS 2560x1440 resolution.I'd heavily recommend a decent 4-player mod or 4-player edit as with 4 people the game is even more fun; though by itself it would still offer people a good experience. Even with the massive content rich evnironment myself and all those I know who love this game are left craving more; different campaigns from the communities and DLC from the developers bringing us new campaigns!

												There are a lot of reviews, and perhaps one more isn't needed. But hopefully this will be a good one for those of you on the fence, since this game is not usually on sale. In summary, yes, this game is worth $39.99. No question! First, the positives. For a game funded through Kickstarter and seemingly made under financial duress, the polish is that of a larger publisher's work. There are some aspects of it that do scream ""needed more budget,"" but overall, this is a fine piece of work. The gameplay itself is also fun, yet simple. Combat relies a lot on terrain, use of elements, distance, position... for such a seemingly simple setup, the combat can get really creative. You can sneak around and plant oil barrels in preparation for a fight with an invisible character, and then set off a giant explosion with fire. Of course, then fiery oil is everywhere and no one can see anything, and if you use a lot of barrels, you might get caught in the spreading flames. Combat in Divinity is often like this, with crazy sequences.The story is also not just a placeholder. It's funny, self-aware, sometimes terrifying. The game doesn't take itself too seriously but it can get very dark. The campy, dark humor is very refreshing, and conversations with NCPs more entertaining than it should be. The character creation is very flexible, and at a later point in the game you can even reset your character (!), at the cost of re-quiring all your skillbooks. I haven't got to play CO-OP, but I imagine the reset was for this kind of gameplay.There are some negatives, not insignificant. The graphics can be extremely frustrating to target in combat, as the area to click on for enemies actually moves around with the opponent's outline. The UI, especially how items and the stash works, is absolutely cluttered and terrible. The bags you get don't make it any simpler. The other problem is the game likes to use puzzles, and these puzzles are often absolutely opaque. There's no way to figure them out, or the solution is so narrow and specific, you probably would have never thought of it.The paper-rock-scissors event to solve disputes between characters is utterly irritating, especially in single play. I imagine in COOP it's probably hilarious. But I don't like that it occurs with NPCs, since it's really just a random chance to overcome your opponent.These cons aside, Divinity is a really magical game. It's pretty, it's fun, you can play with a friend (which I will do very soon!) and you won't regret purchasing it, even at full price. Highly recommended!			"

Posted: July 27, 2014
												My second review, yay :D(P.S. Please ignore all of the grammar and spelling mistakes, I wrote this review when I was waay to tired)Anyways, I can defenatly recommend this game. At first I was skeptical, since I'm not one for Top-Down view games. Especially when there is turned based combat. But after the first few hours or so I just started loving this game, and I don't think I'm even a quarter through it.So like I said its a top-down view game, wher you can move your character either by holding the left mouse button and then draging it in the direction that you want to move in, or my simply clicking on anywhere in the area.The combat is turned baste, which at first was a ""meh"" thing for me since turned baste games are a ""meh"" kind of thing but after an hour or two it just became something that was there and I accepted it, so its defenatly not a negative aspect for me. I haven't really figured out what decides the order of when each character goes, but so far my characters were all ways the first ones (yay). Similar to other games with turne based combat, you have AP which decides what and how much you can do per turn. So if you need to move in order to dash at the enemy because a big rock is in the way, both of those things will cost AP. If you level as specific skill from your Characters, you will get more starting AP. And if you just simply do nothing and skip a characters turn, or you do something which doesnt require a lot of AP, the left over AP gets added to your next turn.Now at the beginning of the game you can go into a Tutorial Dungeon, where you will already get to learn quit a few of the games mechanics, LIKE LIGHTING TORCHES (I love little things like these). You can move boxes and barrels around to find a hidden key under neath that may unlock a chest or a door. You can use the environment to your advantage in combat. For example there are barrels that have poisen in them, you can move them into position so that when you enter combat all you need to do is shoot them with an arrow (or something equivallent) to make them explode. Now of course you could already explode the barrels even before you enter combat, to already deal damage to your enemies.You also have to look around real carefully for traps or hidden loot.But even outside of the Dungeons and inside the Towns you can do a lot of stuff. For example, you can brake into other people homes and steal their stuff, all though you have to be carefull because if you get cought there will be consequences.You can trade with pretty much anyone, and all most everyone will have something to sell to you, or you can sell anything to them. The trading in this game is pretty good to, you don't necessarily don't need to pay for the Items with Gold. If you have some spare equipment that you don't need, you can use that to pay for the Items. Making your useless crap into...something...more...usefull.....yea.Like someone ells have probably already said, you need to talk to different people in order to get your quests, so no exclamation marker above peoples heads to tell you where a quest is to be found. Which is actually pretty cool and something new. And for me it draws and immerses me more into the game.You are also able to use your abilities (like becoming invisible) in order to accomblish different things.When you create a new game you get to customise two characters, meaning you will have two main characters that you can switch between (and later you can also switch between other party memebers that you pick up). Again at first it was a ""meh"" thing for me but I have gotten used to it and I actually quit like it now since I can have a Mage and a Rouge. Though you can also teach both characters both things, so the starting class that you pick is just more of a specialisation rather then a locked in character class. When you are talking to a NPC and they give you a choice, you sometimes need to defend your choice from your parters choice by a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. And who ever wins, their choice will be take. So if you say ""Kill them all"" but your partner says ""Spare them all"" and you play the game of rock-paper-scissors and you win, that means that you and your partner will kill every person/enemy there. There are also stats that influence of how quickly and easaly you can win these little games.The writing/story of this game, for me, has ben pretty good so far. Though its best if you find that out yourself, or look at a few videos.I can't comment on the Co-Op part of this game yet, since I haven't played this game with a friend up until now, but I'm sure if you enjoy the single player like me then you will definitly love the co-op. Though I would recommend playing it with a friend that is also interested to hear the story, and not just goofing off killing every body (though in a second play through there is nothing standing in your way of doing that of course).So do I recomend this game, hell yes. At first I was skeptical about it, with the top down and turn based thing and all, but after a few hours I can definitly say that this game has become one of my favorit games. And the RPG element in this game is pretty awesome.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is this year's most positive surprise, without doubt. It's very much an old school RPG, with a large world that doesn't scale to your level, and plenty of complex game mechanics and character customization, in the best RPG fashion. The main plot could've been something more interesting, but then again it's constructed in a way to leave lot of room for personal choice of style, trying its best to avoid black and white morals.One of the most interesting aspect of the game is the two main characters, and their possibility to interact and contradict each other. The games uses a rock-paper-scissor social game mechanic to resolve social disputes, which I think earns major extra points: It's a simple mechanic that works really well; much better than a simplistic skill check like in most RPGs.I personally find the game's crafting mechanics a little bit confusing, but I guess they're built in a way to promote experimentation and trial and error, you'll find crafting instructions within ingame books, but otherwise there's no information on it. Barely anything in manual.The best part of the game is the turn-based combat. Really. It fits this genre perfectly. Combat can be very challenging at times, and the game mechanics really take advantage of the turn-based with lots of complexity e.g. regarding the relation of the different magical elements, which affect each other in multitudes of ways creating emergent complexity that leaves a lot of room for creativity. Combat is very much a thinking man's game in Divinity: Original Sin. Large number of combatants can make the fights a bit frustrating at times, but then again, you can save any time, any where, even during combat rounds, so although the fights can be a challenge, you're welcome to save scum your way to victory.Overall, it's an excellent RPG with old school feel (lots of text to read!), pleasant overall graphics and very solid game mechanics. It's definitely worth the monies if you like old school RPGs and don't mind reading through a lot of text (the dialogue can be a bit bloated at times).			"

												First, to the developers, a heartfelt thank you. Probably my first computer gaming experience was Ultima VII. I never finished it. It was too long, I was too young, and it was too hard to get games to run in the first place back then (memory managers? who remembers that crap?). It has, in the rouchly 25 years of gaming since then, been my white whale. I think about it constantly and long to play it again and finally finish it. Divinity: Original Sin captures so much of what made that game great to me, and so much of what simply doesn't exist in gaming today. It shines creatively, both in a refreshing take on stats/classes/skills/etc, as well as the story. I personally found the graphics to be very good as well. Art is a purely subjective thing to discuss, and I won't say that this game is for everyone. But I will say, if you want a deep role playing experience, turn-based combat, and a pool of nostalgia deep enough to drown in, this is the game for you.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is this year's most positive surprise, without doubt. It's very much an old school RPG, with a large world that doesn't scale to your level, and plenty of complex game mechanics and character customization, in the best RPG fashion. The main plot could've been something more interesting, but then again it's constructed in a way to leave lot of room for personal choice of style, trying its best to avoid black and white morals.One of the most interesting aspect of the game is the two main characters, and their possibility to interact and contradict each other. The games uses a rock-paper-scissor social game mechanic to resolve social disputes, which I think earns major extra points: It's a simple mechanic that works really well; much better than a simplistic skill check like in most RPGs.I personally find the game's crafting mechanics a little bit confusing, but I guess they're built in a way to promote experimentation and trial and error, you'll find crafting instructions within ingame books, but otherwise there's no information on it. Barely anything in manual.The best part of the game is the turn-based combat. Really. It fits this genre perfectly. Combat can be very challenging at times, and the game mechanics really take advantage of the turn-based with lots of complexity e.g. regarding the relation of the different magical elements, which affect each other in multitudes of ways creating emergent complexity that leaves a lot of room for creativity. Combat is very much a thinking man's game in Divinity: Original Sin. Large number of combatants can make the fights a bit frustrating at times, but then again, you can save any time, any where, even during combat rounds, so although the fights can be a challenge, you're welcome to save scum your way to victory.Overall, it's an excellent RPG with old school feel (lots of text to read!), pleasant overall graphics and very solid game mechanics. It's definitely worth the monies if you like old school RPGs and don't mind reading through a lot of text (the dialogue can be a bit bloated at times).			"

Early Access Review
								Keep in mind this is a beta, so optimization isn't perfect by any means, but I am having a lot of fun with this game. The level of freedom you get to exercise in building your characters, as well as the ways you can use those skills to solve puzzles, adds a huge level of independence that other games are relucant to allow. The turn based combat is also a nice change from the wave of ARPGs lately that haven't been doing much for me. I have a chunk of hours already invested, and my characters are barely level 4. If you want to enjoy a game with tons of quests, deep and thoughtful character creation, and even a quest creating tool that will be linked to the steam workshop, here is your game.Also, you can talk to chickens and dogs.

												A really fun game which reminds me of the days where i used to play baldur's gate. everything in the world is interactable, even in combat, giving a wider approach to fights strategy wise, for example teleporting an oil barrel amidst a group of enemies then casting a fireball on the oil to trigger an explosion, making the use of the fireball spell much more efficient. When playing multiplayer, you can even argue with your partner as to making decisions, making the multiplayer a hell lot of fun. my only complaint is that the characters in the game lack something that attracts you to them (maybe it's just me, but well..).8/10 would pay & play the DLC.

Posted: July 27, 2014
												My second review, yay :D(P.S. Please ignore all of the grammar and spelling mistakes, I wrote this review when I was waay to tired)Anyways, I can defenatly recommend this game. At first I was skeptical, since I'm not one for Top-Down view games. Especially when there is turned based combat. But after the first few hours or so I just started loving this game, and I don't think I'm even a quarter through it.So like I said its a top-down view game, wher you can move your character either by holding the left mouse button and then draging it in the direction that you want to move in, or my simply clicking on anywhere in the area.The combat is turned baste, which at first was a ""meh"" thing for me since turned baste games are a ""meh"" kind of thing but after an hour or two it just became something that was there and I accepted it, so its defenatly not a negative aspect for me. I haven't really figured out what decides the order of when each character goes, but so far my characters were all ways the first ones (yay). Similar to other games with turne based combat, you have AP which decides what and how much you can do per turn. So if you need to move in order to dash at the enemy because a big rock is in the way, both of those things will cost AP. If you level as specific skill from your Characters, you will get more starting AP. And if you just simply do nothing and skip a characters turn, or you do something which doesnt require a lot of AP, the left over AP gets added to your next turn.Now at the beginning of the game you can go into a Tutorial Dungeon, where you will already get to learn quit a few of the games mechanics, LIKE LIGHTING TORCHES (I love little things like these). You can move boxes and barrels around to find a hidden key under neath that may unlock a chest or a door. You can use the environment to your advantage in combat. For example there are barrels that have poisen in them, you can move them into position so that when you enter combat all you need to do is shoot them with an arrow (or something equivallent) to make them explode. Now of course you could already explode the barrels even before you enter combat, to already deal damage to your enemies.You also have to look around real carefully for traps or hidden loot.But even outside of the Dungeons and inside the Towns you can do a lot of stuff. For example, you can brake into other people homes and steal their stuff, all though you have to be carefull because if you get cought there will be consequences.You can trade with pretty much anyone, and all most everyone will have something to sell to you, or you can sell anything to them. The trading in this game is pretty good to, you don't necessarily don't need to pay for the Items with Gold. If you have some spare equipment that you don't need, you can use that to pay for the Items. Making your useless crap into...something...more...usefull.....yea.Like someone ells have probably already said, you need to talk to different people in order to get your quests, so no exclamation marker above peoples heads to tell you where a quest is to be found. Which is actually pretty cool and something new. And for me it draws and immerses me more into the game.You are also able to use your abilities (like becoming invisible) in order to accomblish different things.When you create a new game you get to customise two characters, meaning you will have two main characters that you can switch between (and later you can also switch between other party memebers that you pick up). Again at first it was a ""meh"" thing for me but I have gotten used to it and I actually quit like it now since I can have a Mage and a Rouge. Though you can also teach both characters both things, so the starting class that you pick is just more of a specialisation rather then a locked in character class. When you are talking to a NPC and they give you a choice, you sometimes need to defend your choice from your parters choice by a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. And who ever wins, their choice will be take. So if you say ""Kill them all"" but your partner says ""Spare them all"" and you play the game of rock-paper-scissors and you win, that means that you and your partner will kill every person/enemy there. There are also stats that influence of how quickly and easaly you can win these little games.The writing/story of this game, for me, has ben pretty good so far. Though its best if you find that out yourself, or look at a few videos.I can't comment on the Co-Op part of this game yet, since I haven't played this game with a friend up until now, but I'm sure if you enjoy the single player like me then you will definitly love the co-op. Though I would recommend playing it with a friend that is also interested to hear the story, and not just goofing off killing every body (though in a second play through there is nothing standing in your way of doing that of course).So do I recomend this game, hell yes. At first I was skeptical about it, with the top down and turn based thing and all, but after a few hours I can definitly say that this game has become one of my favorit games. And the RPG element in this game is pretty awesome.			"

												The best CRPG in years and will no doubt make the top lists of best CRPGs for years to come. This game is so detailed, rich, and deep that it feels like playing a pen-and-paper RPG at times. There's a learning curve and it's tempting to stall out early because you think you've run out of things to do, but that's because it doesn't hold your hand. I'm the type that often skips through dialogue to get to the combat, but this game's narrative is compelling and worth following. There aren't the ordinary NPC quest givers that tell you where to run and what to do. You have to follow the stories, tease out clues, and figure out on your own how to act next. The environments are highly interactive and can be used in many different ways - both tactically and strategically. The combat system is fun and challenging. Baldur's Gate meets XCOM?			"

I will continue add information to this when i played further.Gfx is top of the class they really now there stuff. --/10Sfx and music is top of the class as well. --/10Gameplay mechanics works weary well and easy to learn. --/10Score will be set later			"

												Kickstarter shows us once again that the publisher establishment couldn't find it's own♥♥♥♥♥with both hands and a map.This excellent title is an amazing foray into classic style, Baldur's Gate-esque gameplay, with meaningful character interaction, humor, the ability to talk to animals (and even do quests for a house cat, lol).  This title will be one of those few which always remain installed on my computer, along such excellent works such as Wasteland 1 & 2, Mass Effect, the Fallout series, and TES: IV Oblivion.Graphics are outstanding, and use a sort of fog of war which allows you to see what is going on in your tactical view unimpeded except by range (and even then all terrain is visible) while the actual black fog is cleared on your strategic map and minimap views.  Combat?  Out-Freakin-Standing.  Turn based, action point oriented combat will leave you feeling like you're playing a fresh take on a late 90's RPG like Fallout 2, and magic attacks no longer pull from a mana or MP pool, rather, they act like all other actions simply requiring an investment of action points, no different then a warrior swinging a sword.  This helps with your everpresent necessisty of maintaining a massive inventory of mana potions which you encounter in most games with a caster class.Overall, I've had more fun in only a few hours with this title than I have with nearly anything else that has been released in the last year and a half.9/10, would recommend this to you again.

If so, this game will score some major points with you.  It is turn based, which at first delayed my purchasing of it.  After a couple of hours in and a few battles under my belt, I realized that it is actually a huge benefit.  I have had more fun with the combat in this game than I have with action games (like NWN).  Combat:The combat is turn based, but that is a good thing.  You can setup the battleground and you have a lot of time to think about how you are going to proceed.  The environment can react to what is done to it.  Mix poison with fire for explosions, cold with water to create freezing, air with water to create electrified surfaces/clouds...  etc.  You can throw things around while in combat.  Want to light up that boss?  Throw that oil or poison barrel next to him and have your mage/archer hit it will something fiery.  Archers getting the best of you from a range?  Create a smoke screen so they cannot see you.  Melee enemies chasing your glass cannons?  Put some ice on the ground or throw the enemy half way across the battle field - make him land on his allies for additional damage to them as well.  Crafting:There are guides online for recipes - and for good reason.  While the books and such you find around the area hint towards recipes, they do not provide all of them - or perhaps I did not find all of the books.  To craft, you just drag an item over another item.  It is much like ""Alchemy"" (the game) in that sense.  You could spend a while just trying to combine everything until you find all of the recipes or you could just go online and find them there.  Questing:There are a lot of quests in this game.  I did not find any of them to be disappointing in terms of entertainment.  I often found the side quests to be more entertaining than the main storyline.Exploration:There is a lot to do and plenty of subtle secrets to find.  This game rewards (or severely punishes) the curious.  Save often.Main storyline:While it was intriguing to a point, I did not gain a real attachment to it.  There was no cataclysmic climax that the characters (or me as a player) really felt attached to.  While it is a story that wraps around the characters, it doesn't really seem attached to them.  Your role in the game seems more like an extra character than the main character at times.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good storyline, but I would not buy this game for that purpose alone.			"

												Played it for 7-8 hours and it's like Baldurs Gate, but then the deluxe version. Its not fast paced (turn based combat never is), but time sure goes fast. You want to open every crate, box and basket. You talk to anybody who might have a clue and when you are too bold you probably gonna die. you start out with two characters and after a short time you are able to get a third. Talking with animals (if you have that capability is possible. It's just great fun and co-op? Oh my... this game is truely fun for two players who like the turn based gameplay. Baldurs gate fan? you want this!			"

								Excellent game. It feels like theres a new scenario around every corner and the games personality is quirky and fun. Combined that with an engaging combat system and 2 player co-op and you have a RPG of the Year contender. If you've every loved a cRPG, don't miss out on this one!			"

												Kickstarter shows us once again that the publisher establishment couldn't find it's own♥♥♥♥♥with both hands and a map.This excellent title is an amazing foray into classic style, Baldur's Gate-esque gameplay, with meaningful character interaction, humor, the ability to talk to animals (and even do quests for a house cat, lol).  This title will be one of those few which always remain installed on my computer, along such excellent works such as Wasteland 1 & 2, Mass Effect, the Fallout series, and TES: IV Oblivion.Graphics are outstanding, and use a sort of fog of war which allows you to see what is going on in your tactical view unimpeded except by range (and even then all terrain is visible) while the actual black fog is cleared on your strategic map and minimap views.  Combat?  Out-Freakin-Standing.  Turn based, action point oriented combat will leave you feeling like you're playing a fresh take on a late 90's RPG like Fallout 2, and magic attacks no longer pull from a mana or MP pool, rather, they act like all other actions simply requiring an investment of action points, no different then a warrior swinging a sword.

												This is fantastic roleplaying game that has a lot of fun exploration, the world is full of details and hidden nooks and crannies and each zone is packed with things to do.The main story is fairly interesting, faily typical high fantasy stuff. The game is packed with lots of quirky sidequests though that often go in unexpected and off the wall directions, be sure to pick the Pet Pal ability as being able to talk to animals is a hoot.  The combat in the game is quite difficult so I reccomend saving often, the quicksave system works well so make good use of it when things go pear shaped. There are a lot of complex interactions in the combat sytem with elements playing a huge part. For example you can shoot a barrel of water then cast lightning bolt on it and create a temporary electrified pool of water that will stun enemies in it (And you too, so be careful). Pools of poison explode so creating them and shooting a flaming arrow to create a damaging fireball is another option. There is a lot of variety there so it pays to pay attention to the enviroment and experiment with the various effects. There is a crafting system thats fairly easy to use but has a lot of complex recipes for making anything from weapons and armor to potions, spellbooks and scrolls. All in all this game has a lot going for it and if you can handle the difficulty I strongly reccomend this for any RPG fan.			"

												Short: similar to Baldurs Gate. This is a nice RPG with no hand holding quest markers, directions, etc.. You have to figure out everything for yourself (besides of the tutorial dungeon cave with basic gameplay explanation) Character builds are open, you get some blue print role models but you can adjust everything as you wish (want a 2-handed combat healer with no INT and STR but a fishing rod and bucket, you are welcome to try).Btw, you create two main characters. At Coop your mate would control the other created main char.Moral or arguing conflicts are resolve with a mini game of rock-paper-sciccors but no lizard and no spock ;-)I really like the gameplay and exploration thing about this game. Round base combat rocks, beside targeting, enemy animation sometime makes you miss clicking them and moving next to them instead of attacking. But you can save game anytime, even during combat. Which you probably do often since combats aren't easy and requires some tactics.D:OS has some downsides:loading times, even from SSDInventory is inconvenient to useCrafting is more inconvenient to use, getting recipes itself is easy but using them. You do not have a list with items to create. You have to drag'n'drop items onto each other without having in game information of combinations that will work..No pause at all, even opening menu wont pause the game - not such a problem besides time tracking or if you want to talk with an moving target..Character portrait does not match (manual chose)Camera shakes are annoying and can't be deactivatedOverall i do not regret backing it at kickstarters. If you liked Realms of Arkania or Baldurs Gate you probalby like this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Even while just in beta I spent a good 20-30 hours in the starting zone, finding my way around, doing quests and building up my class and that of my companions. The game is fun, smart, and doesn't hold your hand. It can be tough but as you define your class and learn how to play it battles become easier and enemies die faster.The perk system is great and alot like that of the Fallout games, some give you huge bonus with even worse negative effects, but if played properly can really help you.The game is classless mostly, even though you start off as a pre-defined style you will find yourself taking different paths, beginning as a warrior and ending as a battlemage, or a rogue to an archer to a wizard, all things are possible.Leveling is slow but rewarding, I barely hit level 10 before my game was completed, and due to some minor beta issues could not continue.I would highly recommend this, its been a long time (Skyrim) since I put so much time into a game and had so much fun.

IntroductionDivinity: Original Sin (commonly referred to as D:OS) follows the same style of play as the original Divinity Series, and also to, Divinity Eco Draconis or the Dragon Knight Saga.  D:OS is a role playing game that follows the rules of Dungeons and Dragons probably better than other games of a similar genre - wherein this game features turn based combat.  Explore freely, get attacked, and rather than being completely unprepared for it, you have the time to formulate your strategyThe GoodThere are very many fun aspects of the game, but the biggest ""success"" is the fact that you're given the freedom to be who you want to be.  If you want to be the most unsympathetic swine in the world - you can.  Want to kill random strangers?  Go right ahead!  Of course, you'll be hunted down for doing so, but at least the game gives you the choice to do it.The term ""LOL"" will apply many times when playing this game - of course assuming you have a funny bone.  I'm sure my neighbours heard me the first time I used the sneak ability.  The main story line is ""serious"", but I'd say a great many of the side quests have some kind of funny anecdote here and there.  These occasional lapses into ludicrity make the game really enjoyable to play.  You may even find yourself drawn into the game emotionally, feeling really sorry for the plight of the people that you are helping.The BadHaving played this game from it's release date, I've found that I've fell into a lot of pitfalls of this game, and I've had to play it 3 times through before being able to complete it.  I'm an achievement fanatic, and unless you play this game in a very specific way, you won't get 100% achievements, because some options just wont' be available.  To me, this is not a good thing, because it reduces some of my freedom.Another bad aspect of the game is the lack of quest markers - in fact, quest markers are, to my memory, used only twice within the game.  This is just simply not enough, considering the amount of times I've had to fumble about with the map to try to figure out where I'm supposed to go.I've spent more time Googling in this game than in any game I've ever played - because a lot of the quest objectives, or maps aren't obvious enough.  The dungeon tutorial also doesn't provide enough tutorial for you to really get to know the game well enough - like for example not telling you that you have the ability to heal yourself or any party member by lying on a bed and resting.ConclusionThanks to the concerted efforts of the developers to provide bugfixes so quickly after the game was released, I can happily say now that this game will now bring you a lot of hours of enjoyment, with a few hours of frustration.  The good news is that you don't have to stay frustrated for long - just use Google and then you'll find the clues that were nowhere else to be seen.  This game will annoy you - but as long as you persevere, you wil find that the overall experience will be more rewarding.Prepare yourself for many hours of fun.			"

												Fans of the Divinity franchise don't need a review or analysis to know what this game is about and how this game is played; but for those who are new to this game, you should know:1. This game does not hold hands. You have to investigate, analyze, think, and process the data that are spread around the world. 2. You will be greeted with lots of texts. Rather than pushing away, they pull you into the story. You don't hear much voice work but the words written are enough to draw you into the story....along with many hints and clues. You will need them all.3. Combat is turn based, but assuming you are not playing on easy difficulty, this game will challenge your skill. Strategize and plan. Succeed and rip rewards; fail and face consequences...4. Fantastic visuals. The world is littered with lots of items that you can interact with. Use them for your benefits, or to earn some extra gold, or perhaps, use to solve puzzle that you are not even aware of will appear later.5. Loot, loot, loot! 6. When the creation tool will be out, you know what the mod community will do with it. Anyone who has modded games or used mods in games such as Skyrim would know...the possibilities are endless. A must have.			"

Very refreashing to be able to do things like that if a bit cheesy on my part. I swear I tried it once just to see if would work... honest.One thing I do have problems is they UI layout and wish it could be changed to just show your inventory in a resisable window so cleaning up your inventory was much easier without the endless scrolling if your holding a item to use with another.Buy the game, go on show the games industry this is the games we want more of! :)			"

Early Access Review
								Even while just in beta I spent a good 20-30 hours in the starting zone, finding my way around, doing quests and building up my class and that of my companions. The game is fun, smart, and doesn't hold your hand. It can be tough but as you define your class and learn how to play it battles become easier and enemies die faster.The perk system is great and alot like that of the Fallout games, some give you huge bonus with even worse negative effects, but if played properly can really help you.The game is classless mostly, even though you start off as a pre-defined style you will find yourself taking different paths, beginning as a warrior and ending as a battlemage, or a rogue to an archer to a wizard, all things are possible.Leveling is slow but rewarding, I barely hit level 10 before my game was completed, and due to some minor beta issues could not continue.I would highly recommend this, its been a long time (Skyrim) since I put so much time into a game and had so much fun.

												Best RPG in a long time. Barring a few points that I've encountered in the game, this is a very good experience all-round. While BioWare and Bethesda are making action games with RPG elements, leave it to Larian to make a worthy spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate 2 style of RPG.			"

								Have the game since the Alpha and it is just getting better and better. The game has a lot to offer for all sorts of RPG fans, and if your playing with a friend the great thing is you dont have to play the same game at all. One is talking to people and bartering while the other one is in some basement stealing everything he can find. Really good fun and the game just begs to be explored. Must play for RPG fans.			"

												Author’s note: Whilst a Kickstarter funder myself, I did not touch the game during its development process – therefore I cannot compare any pre- and post-release changes. This is an early, first impressions review. I shall amend this upon further venturing into the game.Divinity: Original Sin is Larian Studio’s latest addition to the Divinity series, going back to its roots as a turn-based RPG set in an open world with unlimited possibilities. You control two customizable characters, who arrive on an Island chasing down sorcerers, fighting off orcs, and investigating the reports of undead activity in the area. Quirky and engaging, Larian’s Kickstarter darling is a welcome addition to anyone’s game library.Original Sin starts you off by letting you customize your two playable characters. You can change their class, appearance, and even their initial stats, if you wish. There are numerous options to choose from, with the classes ranging from fighter to wayfarer, offering varied styles of play, but can probably be grouped into three major roles (coinciding with the three voice pack choices in game): rogue, warrior, and wizard. There are many roles that min-max certain skill sets, while others act as a blend between two major roles. Overall, there is enough variety here to cater to different play styles. Cosmetic customization is also rich, with options to change gender, hair, voice, skin tone, face, and portrait all available.The game features a very neat art style and visual aesthetic. The world of Original Sin is colourful, vivid, and full of life. The trees sway gently, torches burn brightly, and water flows smoothly – the world feels dynamic and active with every little detail added in. The quality of the game’s graphics is astoundingly good, while also being somewhat efficient – it runs on Ultra by default on my GTX 765M, and I’ve had no issues with it dropping below 30, usually floating at the 40s on FRAPS. The art style is akin to a more realistic Torchlight – colours pop out and everything is somehow cartoonish, but it definitely feels like a believably real representation of its world.Combat in Original Sin goes about in a turn-based, action point oriented style. It is reminiscent of other classic RPGs such as Fallout 1 and 2. Certain actions cost a certain amount of AP, movement AP cost is dependent on distance (in meters, unsure if you can change this to the empirical format) and certain units are given priority to move first. Various stats affect what weapons and armor you can equip, how certain skills work for your character, hit chance, dodge chance, and inventory space. So far, the combat flows nicely, and is quite enjoyable. One of the more noticeable breaks from the usual AP system is that any unused AP in a turn is carried over, adding more options for your later turns.A major part of Original Sin is interaction with its various characters, with special focus between the two player characters. Often times, when a decision is to be made, your characters exchange dialog, with each option affecting certain traits of the characters, such as their persuasion, obedience, and altruism.So far, with roughly two hours in, Original Sin is showing plenty of signs of a good game, and I will definitely invest more time in it to further develop my opinion. It seems like the game is made for coop, with two players controlling one character each. I can see that playing out fairly well, with hilarious results in the inter-character dialog! Overall, I would say that if you were already interested in the game, it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to get it, especially if you have a friend playing it as well. "

												Let me tell you few words about this game. It's amazing what developers did from a Kickstarter campaign. This could be a GOTY, or one of the best RPG so far. It's either you love it, or hate it. I love it. It's an old school game with turn based combat, great graphics, effects and animations, level design and soundtracks which fits perfectly with the setting.  I'm not far in the game, and i can't say about story, but as far as i can say, it's a deep game. You can use environment to kill enemies, you can craft different items from lots of materials, even pizza if you like. The quests can be solved in different ways, you can talk with animals to help you, discover secrets, treasures, and many stuffs. You have the freedom to do what you want and how do you want.  There are plenty of dialogs, similar to Planescape Torment, and you dont have a quest marker, you need to read the journal. You can play alone, or coop, every player gets the chance to answer questions, to agree or disagree completely.     If you want to enter in a beautiful fantasy world with awesome feeling which requires the patience to read any dialog and crafting recipes, then this game is for you.			"

												I have played the game for +20 hours now. I participated in the Beta and been supporting the game since I heard of it during the Kickstarter campaign.So far Divinity: Original Sin (""DOS"") has captured me with all its features and parts; the gameplay, story, world, graphics, difficulty, music, dialogue. It all comes together with good harmony.The game is still quite fresh and there are some minor issues on some areas, but the people at Larian Studios are really showing the effort on fixing all the issues with constant updates and hotfixes.What I like the most in this game is maybe the fact how DOS emphasises the RP element. These days if the game has a character who has and inventory and you can choose his/her name its an RPG. In a way yes, but I think that the definition of RPG has become quite vague, but DOS really gives player the harnesses of his/her characters. You can feel the immersion as you become one with the world and truly make the story feel like your own. The amount of choices and paths player can choose to approach the goals in the game is huge and it doesn't even feel like you have to choose between something, but rather that you do exactly what you want. I hope that other RPG developers will catch on the fact that players of the RPG genre want RP!The other important feature is the Co-op. I haven't yet dived too deep into this feature as I first want to discover thing by myself, but so far what I have seen and heard its good. One more thing for game developers in general, people want Story/Campaign Co-ops for their games!But about the more specific game features:Difficulty:The game is really challenging, even of normal difficulty. I was quite shocked when I had my first real combat, but it was a positive surprise. The game is challenging yes, but you always have a feeling that you can do it, but something just went wrong this time.Gameplay: Gameplay is in general really nice. The turn-based combat works and is really fun. Sometimes in non-combat movement linked characters move a bit stupidly and sometimes seem to arrange themselves wrong in short distance placement. Also I find the party linking system still a bit clunky at times, but I'm confident the developers will keep polishing features like this.World:The world is truly immersive and it feels alive. The Larian humor can be seen in various places and forms, but it fits and it doesn't distract you from the atmosphere at all. Sometimes the city NPCs yelling the same old line comes as a bit of a nuisance, but its a minor thing.Graphics:The graphical look stays loyal to the Divinity saga and is really good in all its simpicity. There are few problems with the way shadows are made for example, but it mostly affects the higher resolution users and I see it also as quite minor issue for now. This also points that the game doesn't have to have top notch graphics with separately animated hair or super realistic 4k textures.Music:The nostalgy of hearing the tracks from Divinity 2, nice! The whole soundtrack is amazing and all the areas have quite nice variability on their sounds, it really fits the world. Only sometimes I have these somewhat intense parts in the music when I'm in the middle of a random dialogue or something and I'm like ""Okay.. I guess this dialogue is quite intense."" *Stares at the fish vendor* but it doesn't happen that often.Story & Dialogue:I really like the games non-linear story, from the very beginning the game doesn't force you to do anything for the story. You can go wherever you want and do what you want and skip all of the story if you so wish. Although I really recommend that you don't skip it :D but like previously stated you can approach the story from your own perspective. There are quests in the game but they have been cleverly hid as Journal entries that update when you do or discover something related to them. There are no handhelding quest markers or quest logs that tell you exactly what to do. I think this is great! Too many of the modern game underestimate the player and have all this cinematic slow motion ""Press X"" scenes and markers on the map to show you where stuff is so you can mindlessly roam from point A to point B. Of course those can of helpers are better with games that only offer one way of completing things in the game.Dialogue is great, it fits the world, its fun with the little jokes every there and now and its believable. There could be more lines for the nameless NPCs because you can ask them quite a lot of stuff, so far they seem to have something like 3 lines per question, but once again quite minor stuff.So as a conclusion; Divinity: Original Sin is a great piece of art to all people who love the RPG genre and great place to start for those who have not yet really dived into it. The game shows promise for the future of modern games and acts as an example for other developers that if you truly believe in it and want to make something great, you can. I'm eagerly following how the game develops even after the release and what's yet coming. I believe this game will be one to speak about in the future.That's all for now, I will update this review if necessary and hoped you find it useful! :)			"

								Me and me mate have been twiddling our thumbs since we finished NWN2 and BG2 before that, wasting our money on wanna be rpgs, but behold whats this Divinity Original Sin?, could this be the game we have been waiting for? 30 hours or so into it and several toon experimentations, RELEASE IT NOW!! darn you, we want to play the full version :).Graphics are nice, AI is very good on mobs but the bosses could use a tweek i think, loving the fast leveling i think that is bang on and the personality bonuses you get from interacting with npc's is a great touch. The game doesent hold your hand with silly quest markers which i also think is great, you can just roam around bumping into monsters and eventually you will find the quest update. Also you can pick a rdy made character class and edit it to your play style which is another lovely touch.This game could be the next BG2 or NWN, will have to wait till full realease to experience all game content but so far im hooked. Only negative i would say is only up to 2 players for co-op.			"

												In short, this game is easily worth $40.Haven't played much of the game yet (just got to lvl 3), but what I have seen so far has been truly impressive.  Combat is a mix between Baldur's Gate II and Temple of Elemental Evil, which is a great thing, especially if you are a fan of those games as I am.  Spell system works a little differently than D&D, however; spells have cooldowns & require action pts to use, no memorizing & resting are required.  Voice acting, Sound-FX, music & graphics are nicely done.  Dialogue is well-written with plenty of wit and the storyline is shaping up nicely.  Haven't messed with the Divinity Engine Toolkit yet, but from what I've seen, if the community gets behind it, expect Skyrim-calibre moddability.  Multiplayer can be fun, but the game is a little slow-paced for two players (lot of reading in between combat) so maybe skip the co-op for your second play thru and try out a different class with your friends.Game crashed on me once so far, but the auto & quicksaves help there.

												Short: similar to Baldurs Gate. This is a nice RPG with no hand holding quest markers, directions, etc.. You have to figure out everything for yourself (besides of the tutorial dungeon cave with basic gameplay explanation) Character builds are open, you get some blue print role models but you can adjust everything as you wish (want a 2-handed combat healer with no INT and STR but a fishing rod and bucket, you are welcome to try).Btw, you create two main characters. At Coop your mate would control the other created main char.Moral or arguing conflicts are resolve with a mini game of rock-paper-sciccors but no lizard and no spock ;-)I really like the gameplay and exploration thing about this game. Round base combat rocks, beside targeting, enemy animation sometime makes you miss clicking them and moving next to them instead of attacking. But you can save game anytime, even during combat. Which you probably do often since combats aren't easy and requires some tactics.D:OS has some downsides:loading times, even from SSDInventory is inconvenient to useCrafting is more inconvenient to use, getting recipes itself is easy but using them. You do not have a list with items to create. You have to drag'n'drop items onto each other without having in game information of combinations that will work..No pause at all, even opening menu wont pause the game - not such a problem besides time tracking or if you want to talk with an moving target..Character portrait does not match (manual chose)Camera shakes are annoying and can't be deactivatedOverall i do not regret backing it at kickstarters. If you liked Realms of Arkania or Baldurs Gate you probalby like this game.			"

												I LOVE playing this game!!I play it with my husband, so I don't have many hours logged. He's at work for at LEAST 10 hours a day. Usually gone for 12. So that leaves us with about 4-5 hours to watch Anime/Movies/Play games every night, except weekends. <3We don't play this all the time, since there are tons of games and shows we have to choose from. :Q AS kjasfjfANYWAY! Enough personal story time. It's free roam when you're out of combat, and speed turn-based while in combat! highest initiation/speed goes first, of course. I play a healer (derp), and my husband plays a mage. He makes me control our companion, so I made her into a beefy two-hander.I also use gear with telekenisis (+2-3 points into the skill), so I can steal EVERYTHING! I love stealing in games when it's available! So I'm a healer with pickpocketing and telekenisis, haha. My husband laughed at me a few times when he's talking to an NPC for a quest, then I tell him to keep them distracted as I pickpocket them.Oh gawd. So.. I don't know what else to say about this game! BESIDES I CAN TALK TO ANIMALS! They also sell you their fur, teeth, etc. Kind of weird, but I'm a pack rat and collect crafting material. Okay this review isn't much of a review, is it? I'll stop now!This game is super fun and addicting to play with another person!! I haven't played it by myself, so I don't know about that! Aaaaaaaaaaa			"

You can go wherever you want and do what you want and skip all of the story if you so wish. Although I really recommend that you don't skip it :D but like previously stated you can approach the story from your own perspective. There are quests in the game but they have been cleverly hid as Journal entries that update when you do or discover something related to them. There are no handhelding quest markers or quest logs that tell you exactly what to do. I think this is great! Too many of the modern game underestimate the player and have all this cinematic slow motion ""Press X"" scenes and markers on the map to show you where stuff is so you can mindlessly roam from point A to point B. Of course those can of helpers are better with games that only offer one way of completing things in the game.Dialogue is great, it fits the world, its fun with the little jokes every there and now and its believable. There could be more lines for the nameless NPCs because you can ask them quite a lot of stuff, so far they seem to have something like 3 lines per question, but once again quite minor stuff.So as a conclusion; Divinity: Original Sin is a great piece of art to all people who love the RPG genre and great place to start for those who have not yet really dived into it. The game shows promise for the future of modern games and acts as an example for other developers that if you truly believe in it and want to make something great, you can. I'm eagerly following how the game develops even after the release and what's yet coming. I believe this game will be one to speak about in the future.That's all for now, I will update this review if necessary and hoped you find it useful! :)			"

												I was preparing to write a long and in depth review hammering out why you should buy this game but I changed my mind.  Bottom line: This is the RPG you have been waiting for. Polish, depth, options, and engagement are apparent from your first click.  Don't hem and haw, don't mull your options, consider if you should, and ponder if it's worth it.  It is, just do it.			"

												Bought this on a whim for the sole purpose of getting a few hours of coop fun in with a friend. Little did I know I was buying one of the best RPGs ive played in many years. Dont let the kickstarter funding fool you, this game has the gameplay depth you would expect from a big time studio. Divinity brings in the best elements of classics like Bauldurs Gate and Neverwinter and gives them a modern approach. If you enjoy turn based DND style combat and a very non linear story you should give Divinity: Original Sin a chance.			"

												10/10The Good: Fantastic CRPG game, reminiscent of bygone days. If you liked the classic Ultima or Fallout series you will love this game. You have utmost freedom in creating your characters and classes. The combat is turned based, ala Xcom. What makes the combat great is the interaction of elements. Make it rain, and opponents get wet. If you now hit them with a ice spell they get frozen. This opens up countless of possible combinations. The story is a bit fantasy cliche, but the world is lovingly crafted, quirky and very immersive. The best part is that it has coop, which is a blast. Your coop partner can literally disagree with you in-game when you speak to NPCs, and change the outcome of a quest.The Bad: The game does not hold your hands, aside from a small tutorial dungeon in the beginning. There are no quest markers, and little to no explanation about its stats system. Little dialog is spoken, so lots of dialog reading is required to know how to finish quests. If you are the impatient type and are looking for an action-rpg, look elsewhere.Verdict: Game of the year for me so far. This illustrates nicely what kind of games are possible when developers don't have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ publishers breathing down their necks about dumbing down or streamlining their games.			"

												This game feels like exactly the sort of slow-burning RPG I've been missing the last few years over. Plenty of stats and classes and items to tinker around with, lots of flexibility and customization, and a really interesting world to play in. I haven't spent this much time just learning about the world (and consequently, how to mess it up) since the days I used to waste exploring Baldur's Gate. Really fun dynamic with the two-player main character feature, and the ability to run it online, co-op or jumping in and out of other people's games makes for a really cool, constantly changing experience.Play this game. Do it.			"

												So, now that I beat the game, time to review !TL;DR: + turn based tactical combat+ elemental synergy+ eye candy+ you actually have to think a bit and use common sense. No more blindly following the big arrow on the screen, you'll have to look for clues and read books+ 80-100h to beat+ number of skills+ secondary quests- difficulty drop at mid-game. Once you understand buff/debuff and have a basic sense of tactic, It gets easy. - the inventory - lack of companionsSo, I recommend this game. I backed it on kickstarter, and I do not regret it. The game, in its mechanics, is challenging, and far from the current videogame standards. You will have to consults your quests journal, use common sense to resolve puzzles (they are not that difficult really, except when you have to look for a *******ing button hidden in shadows or behinda leaf) , look for clues, read every piece of paper or book you find. No quest markers, If you don't know what to expect, you can feel a bit lost there. Combats are great. Really. a bit hard at the beginning. You really have to pay attention to things like initiative, speed, perception, how 2 spells will work together ... It is really a pleasure to begin some chain reaction when combining different elements. Unfortunately, once you understand how it works, how you can buff/debuff, use initiative order and combine elements, you are pretty unstoppable. There is a huge drop in difficulty at mid game. Even the end boss was more ""long to kill"" than ""hard to kill"" . It can make the game a bit borng, because the main storyline, is not really that interesting (I did not say it sucks , but it's average) Concerning the 2 main characters: I liked the rock/paper/scissors system used here, and how you can make your characters disagree on anything :d A word on crafting: depending on your mele/casting orientation it can be useful. There are a lot of recipe that can help at the beginning of the game, but mostly, at some point, you only use it to craft mage skillbooks and add resistance to your equipments. The mechanic is interesting and relies on logic (combining item to create stuff, like ""I use my dagger to sharpen this branch, I get a stake) but it comes with a price: the inventory is not really practical, as everything can be an ingredient for crafting (but you get used to it) NB: I did not test co-op			"

												I gotta laugh at people writing reviews like ""no quest markers"" and such. Sorry, but this isn't a game that slaps you with 100 achievment in the first hour, or holds your hand every step of the way so you can feel like an ubergamer. No. This game has LOTS of reading required and if you actually did, you wouldn't need the quest markers, but I guess that's too much to ask from generation of goldfish-like attention span gamers. I'm sorry you don't like the game, I personally love it and will probably play it again once the enhanced edition comes out.			"

												Modern looking CRPG with roots in the old school. Divinity Original Sin is a solid built RPG with plenty of things to do and see. I started the game as a Cleric and a Knight (vanilla pre made classes the game it self provided for me to choose), then spent the next 10 hours enjoying my self until i came to a place where i kept running my head into a wall.I tried to circumvent this by seeing if there where more quests that i could do, to make my character level grow a bit. But turns out there was nothing left for me to do at this point. So after 3 hours in the same fight i called it quits, and started over. This time i took what i knew from the 10 hours of gameplay and made more focused character by avoiding the vanilla templates that where provided for me to use.I made a custom Ranger and a custom Fighter. The Ranger is a flimsy character, but with a bow i could negate that a bit by staying back. So i focued here points in Dex. For here skills i went with 1 point in Scoundrel only for 2 abilities that i would use all the way to the end of the game. Invisibility and a skill that let me earn more action points for the next rounds. I also put a single point in Geomancer so that i could get the ability to summon a spider, which was also a skill that i used in 95% of all my combat scenarios. After those i never upgraded Scoundrel or Geomancer again and stuck with the Expert Marksman still to give me more abilities in the usage of Bows.The fighter was simple, i focused points in Constitution from the start giving me an edge in terms of HP. His ability points went into Shield specialist and Man at Arms. I wanted him to take all the damage, along with the spider summon.So again played for 9 hours saved some time because i remembered most of what i was supposed to do, got to the same spot, lost. Tried again with a different strategy and i was finally over that painful part. Now this was a fight that had a party of 4 VS. an enemy party of 7-8. The boss fight right after was easy and i almost lost no health what so ever. And this is one of my biggest issues with the game, sometimes you will encounter some very unbalanced fights that just seem there for the sake of making you miserable. Luckily i didn't find my self in that situation that many times, and if i lost the battle i usually had it the next try or the one after.But any how despite all that i loved the 83 hours i have spent on the game. The settings and graphics are so damn nice to look at, and exploring the world is very fun. The whole murder mystery that the game starts off with is without a doubt the best part of the games story. The story gets very dumb and convoluted after you leave the first major town. But that doesn't stop the gameplay from still being very enjoyable and fun.I recommend this game to any one who likes old school RPG games. But i urge every one to focus their stats into a few key areas, if you spread your points out too much you will gimp your character, and make it frustrating and a bad experience. Do not pick any of the pre made classes, customize them and focus on what you want to be doing with that character. Maybe even look up a guide on how to set up some points.ProsTactical combat really fun and robustElemental combat scenariosPlenty of places to spend skill pointsGraphics and art style are gorgeousGood ambient and combat soundsBig variety in skills and magicConsStupid enemy AIUneven fights that result in hair lossVery limited look to armors and weaponsRepetive NPC dialoguePossible to create broken charactersDistribution of loot quality and unusable gear can be a blessing and a curse. Most often the latterStory loses its appeal after the first major townCompanions are very shallow in terms of character developmentFinal boss fight is infuriating and cheapOver all great game. And one i won't forget. "

Be prepared to die, reload your save, and feel amazing satisfaction on getting it right the next time, taking what you learned from your previous failure.Graphically it's solid, story is full of depth and characterization, and the gameplay is addicting and strategic. Highly highly recommend.			"

												Excellent RPG. Good turn-based combat allowing for all kinds of tactical possibilities and ways to overcome difficult fights. Plenty of customization in how to build your characters, and there's no real wrong way to do it, just about anything is viable. Most quests have multiple ways to solve them, giving you freedom to play the kind of character you want without having to completely skip or fail any quests. The only downside is that quests are relatively self-contained meaning there isn't much replay value unless you just want to see things resolve slightly differently, but hopefully with the robust editing tools this won't be an issue, as inevitably we'll have full-length new campaign mods eventually. If you like RPGs, especially older Western ones like Baldur's Gate and (obviously) Divine Divinity, give this game a go.			"

												This CRPG is one of the best out there. The game is played in real-time but the battles are turn-based, with great elemental and landscape interactions. The world itself wonderfully drawn--a nice combination between pretty landscapes and cartoonish monsters. The music is awesome and I enjoy the voicing (I talk to the rats more often than necessary because it makes me giggle). The price is well worth the amount of content for the game ($40). (Edited to add--finished the game at ~91 hours. Awesome value for dollar). The story is engrossing and you make many choices along the way that affect your gameplay. In fact, beware; choices are permanent and have consequences. If you choose to shoot an NPC in the face with a fireball in broad daylight...well, I recommend you save often in case you need to roll back after some instant regret. The puzzles in this game can be hard, and the most difficult aspect is likely the fact that you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING--there's a lot of story and the game expects you to listen and learn. If you get confused or lost (which happened to us...erm, often....) you might get a little frustrated. Consider all of your actions, pay attention to story and quests, put care into where you put your skill points, and you'll be fine. My complaints are small: inventory can become unwieldy, and some of the puzzles are hard (or require patience levels that I don't possess). However, the sheer fun of this game more than makes up for the small bugs and there are a lot of surprises waiting inside this gameI give it a 10/10 for co-op.			"

												This is what games used to be like before they were forced to dumb themselves down for consoles and for people who could not stand having to read something in the game. This is what games used to be like before the control was taken from gamers, before direction markers started solving quests for you. This is what it was like before the games became linear and started holding your hand, telling you every step of the way what you should to and where you're supposed to go, even though there really wasn't any other choice. Larian, thank you for this game. Thank you for having the courage to go against the tide and make something really special. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has ever wanted to play Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment, but couldn't get over the dated graphics and interface. Play this game. Buy it. Don't even wait for the sale, buy it at full price to let the game developers know that we appreciate the effort and that there are still people out there who actually want to *play games*, not just participate in an interactive movie that gives you no choice whatsoever.

												One of the best RPGs I have played, this reminds me of a modern day game of Baldur's Gate or Fallout Tatics game.You have your usual real time action until combat starts then its turn based with action points, the combat is where it shines as you have elemental effects that combine and can change the flow of battle.  For example you can make it rain and use lightening to shock your foes or another way is to use a water arrow and shock arrow combo, there are more then just one way of doing things.Another shining point is the multi player aspect of the game where you make choices and decisions and if you can't agree then its a game of rock, paper and scissors.Over all this is a very good game with some amusing death scenes and great music that brings out the atmoshere of the adventure.This is a game worth its price.

												I decided to wait a while to write a review on this game as I needed to at least ""beat the game"" once (current play time is just over 60 hours).  Divinity: Original Sin is an extremely punishing game to those who think you can brute force down the enemies.  You need to follow the story line and appreciate the game in its entirety to be able to succeed.  While the previous statements may have been negative, the game is 100% worth every penny and I would recommend it to any of my friends.  I have had the most personal fun playing co-op mode with one of my best friends (Escape -> Assign Characters is too hidden!) and it makes the replayability so much more considering you can always try new heroes and/or mercs.With all the positives there are some things that don't make a lot of sense, Crafting and Blacksmithing come to mind.  Have no idea why Crafting is in the game after 60 hours or how to use it.  Blacksmithing is a free repair... which means it's just tedious to use and item durability doesn't serve a purpose then.  The first time you play thru the game make sure you save often and try and balance your team/abilities/read an initial play guide.  If not, you are going to have a very bad time and get to about level 7 or 8 and hit a brick wall that can honestly be impassable.My recommendation is grab a friend, spend some long nights/weekends together and play one of the best action based RPGs I've played in a very long time.  Enjoy your travels together!			"

												I'd like to start by saying, as a person who turns a blind eye to turned based combat games, this game is just spectacular & the implementation of turn based combat along with the rest of it truly makes this game worth playing, and a whole lot of fun. D:OS, is one of today's hand down best RPG games, it has the exploration value and fun, as such games like Skyrim, exploring is truly fun, and as well as that, important for character progression. There's no grinding in this game, XP is rare, which makes looking for monsters that bit more fun! Questing is very in depth, there's no exclamation, the game does not think for you, you do the thinking and choose how each quest is completed, remember EVERY action has a consequence. The elemental collaboration in this game is truly amazing, reminds me of magicka, and how elements are very valuable of how you use them. Finally the party system, you can have up to 4 people in your party, best to allocate each member to a specific role, as you would see in much RPGs, such as a tank, healer, DPS and so forth. Coop is also another high point of this game, you can jump into a friend game, playing their second designed character which I may add INTERACTIONS and actually chosen dialogue is given to both you & your friend for a fun immense RPG experience. This game is so addictive and fun, looking forward to seeing future mods and updates. TL:DR♥♥♥♥♥♥♥buy it, it is amazing 10/10 <3 "

												This CRPG is one of the best out there. The game is played in real-time but the battles are turn-based, with great elemental and landscape interactions. The world itself wonderfully drawn--a nice combination between pretty landscapes and cartoonish monsters. The music is awesome and I enjoy the voicing (I talk to the rats more often than necessary because it makes me giggle). The price is well worth the amount of content for the game ($40). (Edited to add--finished the game at ~91 hours. Awesome value for dollar). The story is engrossing and you make many choices along the way that affect your gameplay. In fact, beware; choices are permanent and have consequences. If you choose to shoot an NPC in the face with a fireball in broad daylight...well, I recommend you save often in case you need to roll back after some instant regret. The puzzles in this game can be hard, and the most difficult aspect is likely the fact that you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING--there's a lot of story and the game expects you to listen and learn. If you get confused or lost (which happened to us...erm, often....) you might get a little frustrated. Consider all of your actions, pay attention to story and quests, put care into where you put your skill points, and you'll be fine. My complaints are small: inventory can become unwieldy, and some of the puzzles are hard (or require patience levels that I don't possess). However, the sheer fun of this game more than makes up for the small bugs and there are a lot of surprises waiting inside this gameI give it a 10/10 for co-op.			"

												An RPG that has great shiny graphics, old school turnbased combat and the same silly storylines that made Divinity 2 great.  The game took a little while to get going but after a few hours you will be busy electocuting, burning and exploding the undead, pirates and orcs. Larian deserves all the success they are getting with this installment of Divinity.			"

												Divinity Original Sin is old-school-style RPG, with a rich atmosphere, lots of character-building, turn-based combat and excellent coop-support where you (or you and a friend) play as the two main-characters, called the ""source-hunters"".TLDR-version: I definitly recommend this game to all non-casual RPG fans, for it highly depends on much reading and using ones own wits to solve or even find quests.[4/5] Gameplay The gameplay as it is would be perfect. You have interesting combat (more on that later), trading and dialouge options with almost every character in the world, a gripping story and huge freedom in terms of character-building. Battle-mage that vanishes like a rouge during combat? No problem. The typical grumpy, know-it-all wizard with devasting spells? Of course. A weak charismatic healer with almost no combat skills? Here you go.There regullary are dialouges between the two heros, where you can define their attitude towards each other and their nature.So the observing reader may ask: Why only 4 out of 5 stars? Well the gameplay experience is hindered by some bugs from time to time (not that often). There is for example a bug, that lets the attributes and breastplate of your controlled hero disappear (only on your client). The host has to save the game and reload it to fix it. Or there is this bug that prevent you from hitting enemies that are to close to rocks or walls (only had this bug twice in my playtime).With these bugs fixed the gameplay would be perfect.[5/5] Combat The combat is round-based. Normally I prefer real-time combat over turn-based, but Divinity: Original Sin is an exception I guess. The combat is incredibly complex (yet easy, don't get me wrong!), so the turn-based system lets you use the terrain and fight very strategicaly. There are tons of different spells and lots of different weapon styles. You can (with the right talent) backstab enemies for extra damage or create a oil surface and inflame that, teleport an enemy into that burning surface, electrify water sufaces or steam-clouds, the possiblities are endless.[4.5/5] Controls Not much to say about the controlls. One could say good controlls don't come to your attention and that's the case here. The game is mainly controlled with the mouse, though there are shortcuts for the spells in your hotbar, the inventory...The only problem that occured to me is that when you try to get some item out of an poisoned/burning/electrified area and you can't reach it from out of that area, your hero steps into it and (especially in the begining of your journey) dies. So you have to be careful...[3.5/5] AIThe AI in this game controlls your character when you are walking by clicking on the ground instead of holding the left mouse button to guide him or her. It does a decent job at that, avoiding hazardous areas or traps, as long as it is able to (see ""controlls"").The AI of enemies on the other hand somtimes is quite dumb. For example: It attacked my main character until he had 20hp left. Now it could have killed him with another successful hit. Instead it started attacking my companions and ended up losing that fight.Sometimes I'm quite thankful for quirks like that, for the fights can be really hard from time to time, yet it feels ""wrong"", if you know what i mean.Often the AI beautifully combines spells and terrain effects, creating challenging fights without feeling unfair. Many times there was that ""WTF?!"" effect when an enemy shot an poison arrow at my group and in the next turn a mage set it on fire, nearly wiping the party.[5/5] Immersion What can I say about this one, except it is perfect? The dialouges are interesting and you can have them with literally every person on the map (except the mobs of course...). A certain talent allows you to speak with animals, which often have an intersting story to tell, a funny sentence (Imagine a rooster saying: ""Soon the cleaver of decapitation will be turned upon you, the revolution is coming!!""), or even tips on how to solve puzzles.[5/5] MapAll of the levels are beautiful designed and contain many details. There are hidden secrets and treasure, quests off the beaten path. Could you ask for more?[4.5/5] GraphicsThe graphics are held in a isometric view and rotatable by some 90°, but you can zoom in really close and look your hero into the eyes (while having a cool blurred background). The game nicely plays with different ambient lighting and weather effects. The spell effects are solid, not always brilliant, but definitly nice. Some of the animations are kind of clunky, yet they do not destroy the atmosphere or immersion.[4/5] AudioThe game has a amazing soundtrack, that beautifully accompanies combat, travel or dialgoues. All the other audio is solid, but sometimes repetitive.Take for example the marketplace of the first city, where you will spend very much time. All of the merchants have a few lines they say, some funny, some serious. But they repeat that few lines over and over again.After hearing ""No one has as many friends, as the man with the many cheeses!"" for the 40th time you have an urge to slaughter that man, believe me. Only a few of the dialouges are spoken, but considering the vast amount of dialouges I guess it's ok. Yet, everything that is spoken is done very well.[NA/5] DevelopersI had no contact with the developers.Though it has some flaws this game is definitly worth buying. It is highly addictive, especially in coop. Divinity: Original Sin is one of my favourite games of all time.Final Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars - Fix the bugs and some of the minor flaws and this game is perfection.			"

												This is a great game with a few issues.  Even with my negative points below I still recommend it for people who like RPG+Turn based battles, if you liked games like Baldur’s Gate series then you will likely enjoy this game.Good:+Great Graphics.+Moody atmosphere for dungeons.+Talk/trade with almost every neutral NPC.+Developers are listening to players and updates/patches are coming out frequently.Not so Good:-Inventory management is clunky.  Yes you can use ""Send to Homestead"" but I would love to see an option to access it from anywhere as well as quick transfer, say CTRL+left click to transfer to Homestead.  -Enemy visual range is so large that often you’re in battle before you can even see them.  Once in battle you often have to move the map around just to spot the enemy, since they are so spread out.-Quest tracking.  I know this was their intent but the lack of any visual clues and limited suggestions in quest log can make questing painful and slow.  I’ve spend a large amount of my time running between people in town asking the same questions and hoping for a different answer or quest update.  If there were better visual clues (pointer) or more details in quest log on what is expected next I wouldn’t feel some much like I’m wasting time running around.-Movement speed, I know this is subjective but for me I feel like the characters move too slowly even at max speed.-So far with my limited play it seems like the enemy count is too low on the maps, i.e. only one or two groups of enemies per map area.

												D:OS is a gorgeously polished old-school RPG in the traditions of Baldur's Gate and similar top-down isometric games.   Its story is engaging and deep if one takes the time to slow down and read.Pros:Beautiful graphics and amazing soundtrackCrunchy tactical turn-based combat (reminiscent of Fallout/Fallout2 and XCOM meets digital D&D)Rewarding to play without the help of online guides -- provides a real sense of accomplishment & advancementThoughtful storyline with no ""morality meter"" -- your choices can affect the plot and open or close certain possibilitiesGood mix of RP-investigation, puzzles, exploration and combatVery little hand-holding: no quest trackers on the radar, easy to get in over your head in combat. Fun and brain-teasing!It's multiplayer co-op!  Go find a duo buddy on your friends list.Cons:Cumbersome inventory systemLots of text to read, if you don't like text (why are you playing old-school RPGs if you don't want to read, tho?)Early game can be difficult until one figures out the character build system.  Plan on re-starting once or twice to find a build you like for your Source HuntersSome combats can be very puzzle-like... this may be a + or - depending on your personal preferences. 9/10 would replay and struggle against the oblivion of the Void again.

												This game is everything I love about video games. It's extremely engaging and a game that is enjoyed best with friends. You will start strategizing, planning out, and manuvering about how to make the best of a situation. You have complete freedom to do whatever it is you want, and your actions actually matter.The writing is as strong as the gameplay. Since the actions you take have real impactful outcomes, you will pay attention to what people are saying, which makes you really focused on the awesome quests there are. This game doesn't dumb anything down. It expects a lot of you. It's challenging, but never impossible. Being able to make the environment a strategic part of a fight feels natural and fun, and you will miss the combat system once you play other RPGs. You will want more, you will want to know what happens to the NPCs, you will want to defeat that boss, you will want to play this game all the time. Enjoy it while it's fresh. Take your time. Personally, it's my GoTY. There's no shame in recreating your characther after a while. I've restarted countless times, and I experience the game differently each time. It's the best game I've played. I wouldn't think twice about reccommending it to anyone who loves strategy and classic-style RPGs. Or anyone. "

												I've donated to a good number of crowdfunded/early access titles over the past year and Divinity: Original Sin is the first one of them that has officially launched and I just gotta say that they have set the bar extremely high (Hot Damn have they evah!) as far as this development trend goes. Their alpha was impressively polished a few months ago and it just got better as the days went on. Larian was so on point, it was sick (in the good way! :P). Now playing the official release is just pure joy.  I'm right back where I was in the 90s playing so many of the amazing cRPG titles that were so much fun and D:OS has brought that all back and then some.  Crowdfunding/EA has allowed Larian to make the game they always wanted to make with total creative freedom and it shows, ohmgosh does it show.Sure there have been some hiccups since launch with issues but there has also been a steady stream of updates as Larian listens to all the feedback and fixes the issues as they pop up.The modding toolkit is ready as well and just waiting for Valve to flip the switch so there is a whole lot more of the goodness to be had from talented modders out there. I am so stoked!			"

												9/10Pros:-Challenging tactical turn based combat-Impressive bullpen of skills and spells-Not a ""baby mode"" rpg.  Prepare to have to explore for quests and tinker for crafting.-Freedom to build the party to cater to your specific playstyle-Solid visuals that add to the atmosphereCons:-Overly ambitious story loses its charm by the finale-Ambiguous crafting system is sometimes too...ambiguous-A few annoying glitchesSynopsis:D:OS is the best game of its kind (party based rpg) to be released since neverwinter nights 2 but is not without flaws.  The narrative suffers from being overly ambitious.  The very world is at stake and it seems that the story writers struggle with how to weave the player characters naturally into the puzzle.  The result is an awkward dance where the game attempts to convince us these source hunters were of course much more than just that.  We don't need to be saving the world for the story to matter.  Having said that, the game has plenty of obvious strengths.  First of all, it is gorgeous.  Dungeons and locales spring to life with the appropriate ambiance and give you a real sense of being in a fantasy world. Next of course is the core gameplay.  I found the turn based combat system is extremely entertaining with diverse groups of enemies bringing equally interesting challenges.  In addition, the questing system forces you to use your head and eyes to advance.  No brainless killing and gathering to be found here.  Overall, a polished RPG experience with a robust amount of content  "

												What Bioware couldn't achieve with Dragon Age series Original Sin has brought to us after so many years of waiting. Yes, they did it - CRPG in modern graphics and with sophisticated, yet easy to understand, game mechanics. Fallout (1&2)-esque combat system, Baldur's Gate exploration and story-telling mechanics and Divinity world that will make you come back again and again. Story is not as epic as you'd like but its execution brings satisfaction and fun. Battles are challenging and you'll have to implement a lot of tactics and preparation (nothing new for BG fans - you are going to LOVE the combat) but they will reward you appropriately - however, you must be aware of the level of your enemies - don't tread into locations with creatures that are 2-3 levels above you or you'll get owned (or not - the game actually lets you wander into such locations and if you are resourcefull enough, you may win those fights - but at a cost of money, resurrection, potions and patience). The only minor down-side of this marvel are a few bugs here and there but developers are getting rid of them as you are reading this - after all, they are nothing game breaking and even AAA titles are often buggy as hell shortly after the release. That's right,this is not an AAA title - it's a Kickstarter game and what a game it is! If Shadowrun was considered a success, this jewel is a miracle. Trully a MUST-HAVE for all RPG fans.			"

												60 hours in and I love this game. Brings back the feeling of games like Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale series. If you are old enough to know these games you will fall in love instantly. If your a younger gamer it may take some geting use to the fact that there is little hand holding with the quests. If you can forget everything you have learned from most recent rpg's (Diablo 3) then you will really start to enjoy the game. The combat is very tactical and satisfying. It is possible to overcome encounters above your level if you employ a little bit of tactics and use the terrain. I wont say the story is Tolkien worthy but its put together well enough and keeps the game progressing. Also there is a lot of hidden humor if you take the time to dialog with npc's. All in all I am loving this game and for once the hype is true. Pick it up and give it a try.			"

												After 80 hours, I finished the game.  I enjoyed my experience, though I'm slightly conflicted in my recommendation.  It's not for everyone, or even everyone who has only played recent RPG's.  It is, however, a worthwhile experience.Does this game have heart?  Yes.  Is the story and combat engaging?  Yes.  Is it challenging?  Yes.But is it good?  Well, mostly.Make no mistake.  This is influenced by traditional RPG from the days of old, where you cut your teeth doing seemingly very difficult things until you've figured out their trick (much like real life).  There are rarely quest map markers to show you your next objective ala Skyrim, and no fairy hanging around telling you what to do.  It's just a world where there are lots of problems, and lots of possible solutions.In a way, this game reminds me of the Stalker series and The Witcher.  You can do anything you want, but a lot of it will end in a quick demise.  Of course I can refuse the troll bridge toll, but doing so will get me pounded.  I can, and did, murder some town NPCs I disliked, and I did so when I knew I would come out on top.  That was satisfying.Enough abstracts.  Here's my in game experience.Hours 1 - 5 (WTF am I doing?): I landed on a beach with little clue how to proceed in the world.  I did some random things, was generally lost.  There are so many deathtraps around town and enemies harder than me, that I didn't want to venture anywhere and contemplated uninstalling the game.Hours 5 - 20 (Oh hey, this is cool):My friend who played the game 10 more hours than me told me about the crucial ""Minor Heal"" spell and free bed at the inn.  That, combined with teleporting pyramid abuse (infinite town portals, group teleport anywhere, anytime), injected whole new life into exploration and combat.Hours 20 - 30 (Money, money money!):I've discovered that sneaking and invis lets me liberate the entire wealth of my town.  I am now swimming in gold, and fights are enjoyable.  I love my rogue Wolgraff, but he dies so quickly.  At least I have an infinite supply of minions to summon to be fodder for me.I've defeated several awesome bosses through ingenuously manipulating weather effects and feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥  This is fun!Hours 30 - 40 (2nd town: keeping things fresh):Yeah, being badass is relative.  There are many things more dangerous than I.  Things are challenging, but I'm getting along.Hours 40 - 60 (Yeah!!!!):I've had a blast!  I've been to exotic locations of legend.  Slew tyrants and monsters alike.  Made major plot points and am fighting a crazy, ridiculous cult.  I sparred my wits against many enemies that would have crossed swords with me, and then killed them anyway for the XP.  It's totally justified, since they were the evil ones, not me.Hours 60 - 70 (still good, but getting stale):I now own the collective wealth of many nations.  I can't even sell my gear because no trader has any money left (despite restocking when I level). Only the legendary (and previously invulnerable) death knights give me pause. Most enemies have too many HP and do too little damage, making fights unnecessarily long.  This feels like a grind.Hours 70 - 80 (OCD kept me going):Game is over! Whew.  The final stretch was interesting, but combat posed no challenge. There were some ludicrous puzzles that would've been frustrating if I didn't consult a wiki guide every hour.  The last boss could never damage any character below 90% hp due to my gear, shields, and healing.  He did, however, take 30 minutes of solid whacking to kill.  My friend has also reviewed this game and pointed out the following:1) This game feels like an inventory management chore at times.  Me: CORRECT.  There are many quest items and I didn't want to throw anything away.  Therefore, I hoarded stuff like I did in Skyrim.2) Early game, enemies poison and burn you way too much; the AI can be unforgivingly brutal.  Me: YEP.  But I exploited the AI as I would Dark Souls -- nothing is a cheap shot.  If I have to run away 10 times to kill some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and then cast smoke screen and do cheap lightning bolts from areas they can't see, I'd do it in a heart beat. The world is unforgiving, and so am I.Protip: Zombies bleed poison.  Poison + fire = explosion.  Throw an infinite use, indestructible, lit candle into their ""blood"" and yell YIPEE KIYAY as you send them into their fiery un-deaths.3) It's hard to click on enemies in combat.  Me: FALSE.  Press ""B"" to have an overhead view.  Now you can click on everyone, every time.  To be fair, I didn't discover this button until hour 70, which by then is too late.In conclusion, D:OS has been a fun but at times tedious ride.  I enjoyed the openness and challenges that its combat and puzzles gave me early game, and disliked their tedium and obtrusiveness later on near the end.  I would recommend this to anyone who misses Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate, and enjoys a challenge.  For those who can't live without quest markers, exploiting enemy AI, and sometimes reading a wiki to get ahead, this game may not be for you.  And nothing is wrong with that.P.S. The ""Pet Pal"" perk was good to have.  Animals say VERY useful and interesting things (not to mention give quests and XP).  I thought it worthless and shunned it for half the game, but in hindsight, it dramatically enhances the flavor of the game.			"

												Honestly, one of the best RPG games I have ever played and I play a lot of RPGs. If you are a fan in any way of old style RPG games or are just a RPG fan in general, you have to get this game. And even if you not a hardcore RPG fan, I really think that you can still have fun with it. I don't understand why its not more popular however this game deserves to be main stream all the way.Pros:- Awesome combat which makes you think before you enter combat situations and really rewards you for eating food which gives you buffs.- No hand holding what so ever therefore making the game challenging but still a lot of fun- Game is long! Finally a game worth the price... I didn't think those existed any more.- Awesome story line that im not where near to finishing but am enjoying so much.- Awesome interaction with the citizens around the city and an all around immersive RPG style game.- Multiplayer is awesome!(Many, many more Pros but I don't want to go on forever)Cons:- The game may not be updated as frequently as most would like.- There is the possibility that you may miss a quest item completely and you may not be able to retrieve this item literally making the game unbeatable, which would make some people mad... but hey pay attention and you should be fine.- Same goes for if you kill an NPC. The NPC might be a quest giver or required for a quest later in the game.- You really have to read up on the forums and research different builds and watch How-Tos... A lot.- Even though Multiplayer is awesome, its only two player, however you can easily download one of the many four player mods out there. I think there is even one on the steam workshop now. Should be easy to find and install.Even with these Cons, this game is so worth it and if you weren't convinced of buying this game before, I really wish that this review convinces you.			"

												I'll list my complaints first because that's usually what people look for in reviews.1. The crafting system is pretty unintuitive and not very creative. All you do is drag one item over the other and it creates a product, so literally all you need is 2 items to make something.2. If you misclick because the enemy was moving around too much in his idle animation and issued a move command instead of attack, you can't cancel your move command.3. The god damned NPCs keep repeating the same phrases over and over... you can't exactly mute dialogue either because you'd still hear their echoes even though their voice is silent.4. Stealing makes the game way too easy early on; you can get 20k+ gold before you even hit level 45. Some skills/traits/talents are completely obsolete, such as choosing between altruistic and egotistical. All reputation does is give you better prices when bartering with someone, so that +2 reputation is garbage compared to +1 bartering.6. There are 4 characters you can have in your party, but max players for co-op is 2, unless you get the mod that unlocks the 3rd and 4th slots for others to join.Now, for the positives1. There is no class system; you can literally build your character in however way you want it.2. The game doesn't hold your hand; you simply pick up quests and figure out how to do them. It's not like ""go to this location pinpointed exactly on your map and do this for me."" I mean♥♥♥♥♥♥ if they knew exactly how to do the thing they requested you to do, why the ♥♥♥♥ would they send you on that quest to begin with?3. I usually hate turn based combat, but this game actually makes it really fun with the variety of abilities your characters have.4. Everything is RNG like a true old school RPG. Loot has random stats, henchmen have random talents, etc.5. Lots of references, riddles, and secrets, which makes exploration feel like it's worth your time.			"

												9/10Pros:-Challenging tactical turn based combat-Impressive bullpen of skills and spells-Not a ""baby mode"" rpg.  Prepare to have to explore for quests and tinker for crafting.-Freedom to build the party to cater to your specific playstyle-Solid visuals that add to the atmosphereCons:-Overly ambitious story loses its charm by the finale-Ambiguous crafting system is sometimes too...ambiguous-A few annoying glitchesSynopsis:D:OS is the best game of its kind (party based rpg) to be released since neverwinter nights 2 but is not without flaws.  The narrative suffers from being overly ambitious.  The very world is at stake and it seems that the story writers struggle with how to weave the player characters naturally into the puzzle.  The result is an awkward dance where the game attempts to convince us these source hunters were of course much more than just that.  We don't need to be saving the world for the story to matter.  Having said that, the game has plenty of obvious strengths.  First of all, it is gorgeous.  Dungeons and locales spring to life with the appropriate ambiance and give you a real sense of being in a fantasy world. Next of course is the core gameplay.  I found the turn based combat system is extremely entertaining with diverse groups of enemies bringing equally interesting challenges.  In addition, the questing system forces you to use your head and eyes to advance.  No brainless killing and gathering to be found here.  Overall, a polished RPG experience with a robust amount of content  "

												I LOVE this game.I've yet to put it down in the days since I've bought it. It's been fun reading and really weighing decisions.  I've been playing with a friend and it's reinvigorated my gaming spirit. Many games before have fallen, this game, err STORY is worth it.Even when I'm not playing it, I'm watching a video or reading something to further my education in this game. There's a lot to understand.This game is not a click n pick looter RPG. One errant click in a dialogue and you're fighting. The turn based combat is something that is worth the price of admission. This isn't a game you'll put down anytime soon. Larian knows what they've created is a monster. That monster has a belly and it's waiting for it's dinner. Just enjoy it, read the wiki, read that guide off google and get your drink ready. Youll be at your keyboard for a while. A good memory is needed or just some pen and paper. Enjoy it.I haven't had this much fun in a while playing a game. It's HEAVILY recommended from me. I'm biased but I feel in the hours I have in it so far, it's been worth while.			"

												Pretty much evrything that a good old-school rpg should contain. The fighting system is very dynamic and the skills are intresting and wellmade. Its not an epic story in the likes of Baldurs gate and NWN but they change your perspective to how story telling can be done in a rpg game. With around 60 hours played i would highly recommend this to anyone why likes rpg. Its baldurs gate and D&D put together. 10/10 would bang it.			"

												I'd like to start by saying, as a person who turns a blind eye to turned based combat games, this game is just spectacular & the implementation of turn based combat along with the rest of it truly makes this game worth playing, and a whole lot of fun. D:OS, is one of today's hand down best RPG games, it has the exploration value and fun, as such games like Skyrim, exploring is truly fun, and as well as that, important for character progression. There's no grinding in this game, XP is rare, which makes looking for monsters that bit more fun! Questing is very in depth, there's no exclamation, the game does not think for you, you do the thinking and choose how each quest is completed, remember EVERY action has a consequence. The elemental collaboration in this game is truly amazing, reminds me of magicka, and how elements are very valuable of how you use them. Finally the party system, you can have up to 4 people in your party, best to allocate each member to a specific role, as you would see in much RPGs, such as a tank, healer, DPS and so forth. Coop is also another high point of this game, you can jump into a friend game, playing their second designed character which I may add INTERACTIONS and actually chosen dialogue is given to both you & your friend for a fun immense RPG experience. This game is so addictive and fun, looking forward to seeing future mods and updates. TL:DR♥♥♥♥♥♥♥buy it, it is amazing 10/10 <3 "

												This CRPG is one of the best out there. The game is played in real-time but the battles are turn-based, with great elemental and landscape interactions. The world itself wonderfully drawn--a nice combination between pretty landscapes and cartoonish monsters. The music is awesome and I enjoy the voicing (I talk to the rats more often than necessary because it makes me giggle). The price is well worth the amount of content for the game ($40). (Edited to add--finished the game at ~91 hours. Awesome value for dollar). The story is engrossing and you make many choices along the way that affect your gameplay. In fact, beware; choices are permanent and have consequences. If you choose to shoot an NPC in the face with a fireball in broad daylight...well, I recommend you save often in case you need to roll back after some instant regret. The puzzles in this game can be hard, and the most difficult aspect is likely the fact that you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING--there's a lot of story and the game expects you to listen and learn. If you get confused or lost (which happened to us...erm, often....) you might get a little frustrated. Consider all of your actions, pay attention to story and quests, put care into where you put your skill points, and you'll be fine. My complaints are small: inventory can become unwieldy, and some of the puzzles are hard (or require patience levels that I don't possess). However, the sheer fun of this game more than makes up for the small bugs and there are a lot of surprises waiting inside this gameI give it a 10/10 for co-op.			"

But no. Without it, it would suck. The tactical combat it gives has a really nice touch.And the Co-Op in this game is the best Co-Op i've played since Borderlands 2. It's tons of fun to play with a friend. (Works perfectly via internet though someone else wrote that it's only LAN, he's wrong)The crafting is also very nice with it's inspiration from survivalgames. There are tons of things you can craft. But somewhat hard to understand at first.I can only say in short...IF you're into RPG's, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												I've tried this game out of curiousity. Then fell in love with how realistic the environment works and how beautiful the graphics are while using magic and other skills.I also loved how skills ""only"" consume AP, in addition to using AP and a seperate SP in most other Turn based games.This makes it more fun to use Mages. But the environment makes it also more dangerous to use them.It's crazy how they've thought of everything and it makes it hard to not hurt your own party.The game doesn't have guidelines and quest markers. All you have is a journal, that gets updated with things you've discovered but there's still no clear answer as to where to go or what to do. This is something you have to find out yourself.The coop feature has made it more fun as i've been playing this with my brother and we've been trying figuring out what to do most of the time. But this kept us playing for longer as we probably would have normally.It's a great game to play if you're willing to explore, think for yourself, and like to sit back in combat thinking about your moves.I highly recommend it.

												Think how great it would be if you had some kind of insane mashup of Baldur's Gate and Divine Divinity. Now treble it, throw in a healthy dose of Larian's usual tongue in cheek humour, and you're looking at Original Sin.  Beginning with two characters (with more NPC's available to recruit along the way) you're a pair of source hunters (think witch finder♥♥♥♥♥inquisition) dispatched to investigate a murder. Though as usual, things aren't quite what they seem, what with the mysterious undead horde at the gates and constant attacks by an Orc invasion fleet.  Combat is turn based and thankfully manages to remain interesting. All combatants act according to an initiative order, with a reserve of action points they can use for clobbering, shooting or spell slinging. What's likely to garner most attention here is the environmental effects - create a poison cloud to gas your foes, then ignite it with a fireball to set them ablaze for good measure. Then douse them with water, which puts out the fire but creates a cloud of blinding steam instead. A cloud which can be electrified to bring a shocking conclusion to the fight.  Dialogue is your good old fashioned multi-choice dialogue tree. Your party members will chime in frequently when certain events happen, both within the party and without.  For your two initial characters you can choose their responses to each other, which seems weird but works quite well. Conversational skills are handled via a mini-game of rock-paper-scissors (though this is skippable) with the character's various skills impacting how this plays out.  The little touches are great; enter sneak mode for example and your character will pull off the old 'walking bush' trick with whatever seems to fit the environment. The screen fades slightly with character's vision cones highlighted so you can try and avoid whoever you're trying to sneak up on from spotting you. The ability to move objects within the world is put to good use in some of the puzzles and offers an interesting means of dealing with things like traps.  Writing so far is fantastic, with Larian's tongue being firmly in their cheek. Three hours in and I'm dressed as a barrel trying to pickpocket the commander of the city guard so I can steal his handkerchief to take to a dog I met in the graveyard so it can tell me if he's involved in his master's murder. This is after I've returned a talking clam to the sea and been transported through time and space to meet the weaver of time who'd quite like some help dealing with the final death of the universe. Never mind RPG of the year, this is probably my RPG of the previous decade.			"

Early Access Review
								Even while just in beta I spent a good 20-30 hours in the starting zone, finding my way around, doing quests and building up my class and that of my companions. The game is fun, smart, and doesn't hold your hand. It can be tough but as you define your class and learn how to play it battles become easier and enemies die faster.The perk system is great and alot like that of the Fallout games, some give you huge bonus with even worse negative effects, but if played properly can really help you.The game is classless mostly, even though you start off as a pre-defined style you will find yourself taking different paths, beginning as a warrior and ending as a battlemage, or a rogue to an archer to a wizard, all things are possible.Leveling is slow but rewarding, I barely hit level 10 before my game was completed, and due to some minor beta issues could not continue.I would highly recommend this, its been a long time (Skyrim) since I put so much time into a game and had so much fun.

												I just love this game :D, Larian studios just hit the nail with this game. After very successful KS campaign and quite long alpha/beta period they managed to fulfill and improve most of their KS promises/features. There is so much content that in 15h of playtime i didn't even left the first town. Considering this I will easily spend 100h  during my first playthrough. When i started playing game just sucked me into beautiful world and interesting stories. Turn based combat is fun, smooth, challenging and amount of diversity in character creating offers many interesting builds to play with.

												Let me tell you few words about this game. It's amazing what developers did from a Kickstarter campaign. This could be a GOTY, or one of the best RPG so far. It's either you love it, or hate it. I love it. It's an old school game with turn based combat, great graphics, effects and animations, level design and soundtracks which fits perfectly with the setting.  I'm not far in the game, and i can't say about story, but as far as i can say, it's a deep game. You can use environment to kill enemies, you can craft different items from lots of materials, even pizza if you like. The quests can be solved in different ways, you can talk with animals to help you, discover secrets, treasures, and many stuffs. You have the freedom to do what you want and how do you want.  There are plenty of dialogs, similar to Planescape Torment, and you dont have a quest marker, you need to read the journal. You can play alone, or coop, every player gets the chance to answer questions, to agree or disagree completely.     If you want to enter in a beautiful fantasy world with awesome feeling which requires the patience to read any dialog and crafting recipes, then this game is for you.			"

								I haven't played any divinity games before and this game is definitely a first for me.I'm currently playing the beta and it's interesting to say the least, an RPG - Diablo 3, guild wars 2 and skyrim combination.The combat is very peculiar and might take a while to get used to but at the moment it's great!8/10			"

Early Access Review
								Have the game since the Alpha and it is just getting better and better. The game has a lot to offer for all sorts of RPG fans, and if your playing with a friend the great thing is you dont have to play the same game at all. One is talking to people and bartering while the other one is in some basement stealing everything he can find. Really good fun and the game just begs to be explored. Must play for RPG fans.			"

												Author’s note: Whilst a Kickstarter funder myself, I did not touch the game during its development process – therefore I cannot compare any pre- and post-release changes. This is an early, first impressions review. I shall amend this upon further venturing into the game.Divinity: Original Sin is Larian Studio’s latest addition to the Divinity series, going back to its roots as a turn-based RPG set in an open world with unlimited possibilities. You control two customizable characters, who arrive on an Island chasing down sorcerers, fighting off orcs, and investigating the reports of undead activity in the area. Quirky and engaging, Larian’s Kickstarter darling is a welcome addition to anyone’s game library.Original Sin starts you off by letting you customize your two playable characters. You can change their class, appearance, and even their initial stats, if you wish. There are numerous options to choose from, with the classes ranging from fighter to wayfarer, offering varied styles of play, but can probably be grouped into three major roles (coinciding with the three voice pack choices in game): rogue, warrior, and wizard. There are many roles that min-max certain skill sets, while others act as a blend between two major roles. Overall, there is enough variety here to cater to different play styles. Cosmetic customization is also rich, with options to change gender, hair, voice, skin tone, face, and portrait all available.The game features a very neat art style and visual aesthetic. The world of Original Sin is colourful, vivid, and full of life. The trees sway gently, torches burn brightly, and water flows smoothly – the world feels dynamic and active with every little detail added in. The quality of the game’s graphics is astoundingly good, while also being somewhat efficient – it runs on Ultra by default on my GTX 765M, and I’ve had no issues with it dropping below 30, usually floating at the 40s on FRAPS. The art style is akin to a more realistic Torchlight – colours pop out and everything is somehow cartoonish, but it definitely feels like a believably real representation of its world.Combat in Original Sin goes about in a turn-based, action point oriented style. It is reminiscent of other classic RPGs such as Fallout 1 and 2. Certain actions cost a certain amount of AP, movement AP cost is dependent on distance (in meters, unsure if you can change this to the empirical format) and certain units are given priority to move first. Various stats affect what weapons and armor you can equip, how certain skills work for your character, hit chance, dodge chance, and inventory space. So far, the combat flows nicely, and is quite enjoyable. One of the more noticeable breaks from the usual AP system is that any unused AP in a turn is carried over, adding more options for your later turns.A major part of Original Sin is interaction with its various characters, with special focus between the two player characters. Often times, when a decision is to be made, your characters exchange dialog, with each option affecting certain traits of the characters, such as their persuasion, obedience, and altruism.So far, with roughly two hours in, Original Sin is showing plenty of signs of a good game, and I will definitely invest more time in it to further develop my opinion. It seems like the game is made for coop, with two players controlling one character each. I can see that playing out fairly well, with hilarious results in the inter-character dialog! Overall, I would say that if you were already interested in the game, it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to get it, especially if you have a friend playing it as well. "

												This game won't ever exist again. Maybe its not the best game ever made, and the CRPG style might be trying at times. However, its existence is a miracle and one that won't be repeated. Expect to see CRPGlikes flow in all directions in the indie scene from the wellspring of this game, but make no mistake, they will not compare. Every other revival of this genre from the current Kickstarter craze like Wasteland 2 and Project Eternity will lack the one thing this game brought to the table that is immutable, unobtainable, and pure. Those games will not inherit the true soul of the genre. Play this game, and feel free to never play a CRPG again.			"

												Brillaintly realised modern day version of the old Baldurs Gate sytle games, a real gem that's proven Kickstarter can produce some wonderful games.An expansive map filled with numerous quests (both main and side), interesting story and great character advancement options plus a lot of tough, make you think and fight intelligently battles (with some truly awesome elemental & terrain interactions) all adds up to a really great game. The first map (as far as I've gotten) contains at least 20 hours of gameplay, if not more (I know there's quests I missed) and there are at leaast another 2-3 maps that size apparently (and I haven't even *started* exploring my home 'base' which has something like a dozen portals to other realms in it... o.O)If you liked Bladus Gate, Icewind Dale, etc then I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this game, I do.

You die very easily in this game. I would recommend learning how to revive before you get yourself killed otherwise you will be sitting at the computer screen with a mopey face watching your friend run around like an idiot searching for a way to heal you.

												Divinity: Original Sin is a beautiful game, everything from the look of the water, to the sound design is top notch in my opinion. What really makes it awesome, is that it relies on a sort of ""old school"" methodology when it comes to combat and questing. I think that is what sets it apart from so many other games, and in a good way. This game is not easy, but at the same time, I wouldn't say that its unfairly difficult. As long as you take the time to understand the mechanics, it won't be too bad. It really makes the player analyze each encounter, and use that knowledge to be better prepared for future fights. The game's combat is turn base, so that might put some people off, but I personally think thats part of the reason the game is so great. It gives you the freedom to stop and think instead of rushing into a fight. Another point I mentioned, was the questing system. This game is totally free of hand holding, so you really need to use your head to figure out the quests, you actually need to talk to the NPC's and explore the environment to have any chance of completing them. (Get petpal ASAP!)""Player choice"" and ""Freedom"" are terms often used to describe games, but usually I feel, most games fall short of allowing the player to really play the game how they want. With Divinity: OS, this is not the case, you really can play the game how you want. If you want to kill the starting NPC's that give you the first quests, you can do it. There is no set path that you are supposed to follow, you can really play the game how you want.Lastly, I just want to mention that somethings are hard to figure out when first playing the game. For instance, you will want to save up ability points so you can unlock better skills instead of spending them right away. Certain things like this can be tough to figure out, so I would recommend reading some beginner guides online first. There are some great ones on Steam already. Past the basic stuff, I wouldn't read anything else online though, part of the fun of this game is figuring stuff out on your own.Honestly, this is one of the best games I have ever played. I don't think I've been this engrossed in a game in years. If you like RPG's and rewarding/challenging games, please get this game, it really is amazing.			"

												D:OS is in a word...amazing. Think Baldurs Gates but Co-Op with a little Magicka thrown in as far as spell interaction goes. Nasty archers with fire arrows or pyrokinetic mages have your friends on fire? Use your magician to make it rain and quench the flames...and guess what now everyone is wet and susceptible to being frozen with a chill spell. Not to mention you can fire lightning at a puddle of water or blood to make a stun field. So many possibilites. Wanna steal from an NPC but they keep walking around? Break up your party and talk to up 3 NPCs separately while you rob them blind. Pick up a talent called Leech and everytime blood toches your character (even their own) they recieve Health. Nasty Melee enemy right in your caster/ranger's face? Teleport him into the sky and drop him on his head (or his friends) for great damage and better position.So much can be said about this game but know this TACTICS RULE THE DAY. Fully utilizing your party is the key to victory even on normal difficulty. Learn how ALL OF YOUR SKILLS interplay, DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT stifle your own development by only sticking to Oil/Fire. Nothing can beat a varied party that really knows how to change any situation. And Last but not least FULL ONLINE CO-OP not just some watered down mode.			"

Biggest things I love about this game - combat plays out like the original Fallouts, and the game does not hold your hand at all.

												This CRPG is one of the best out there. The game is played in real-time but the battles are turn-based, with great elemental and landscape interactions. The world itself wonderfully drawn--a nice combination between pretty landscapes and cartoonish monsters. The music is awesome and I enjoy the voicing (I talk to the rats more often than necessary because it makes me giggle). The price is well worth the amount of content for the game ($40). (Edited to add--finished the game at ~91 hours. Awesome value for dollar). The story is engrossing and you make many choices along the way that affect your gameplay. In fact, beware; choices are permanent and have consequences. If you choose to shoot an NPC in the face with a fireball in broad daylight...well, I recommend you save often in case you need to roll back after some instant regret. The puzzles in this game can be hard, and the most difficult aspect is likely the fact that you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING--there's a lot of story and the game expects you to listen and learn. If you get confused or lost (which happened to us...erm, often....) you might get a little frustrated. Consider all of your actions, pay attention to story and quests, put care into where you put your skill points, and you'll be fine. My complaints are small: inventory can become unwieldy, and some of the puzzles are hard (or require patience levels that I don't possess). However, the sheer fun of this game more than makes up for the small bugs and there are a lot of surprises waiting inside this gameI give it a 10/10 for co-op.			"

The game took a little while to get going but after a few hours you will be busy electocuting, burning and exploding the undead, pirates and orcs. Larian deserves all the success they are getting with this installment of Divinity.			"

												I've finished the game yesterday. It's a good game, but it's overrated.Pros:- Interesting, turn based combat system.- Controlling two independent characters at once (would love to try this with multi).- Classless character system.- Mod system.- Soundtrack.Okays:- Graphics.- Amount of content.   Well, I think there's a lot of content, but not everything seems to be well thought out. I dislike the Diablo-esque loot system, where bosses or chests drop too much of random loot. Old BlackIsle games didn't do stuff like this :/- Dialogues.   Lots of work went into them, but they seem to be unpolished sometimes. Sometimes they're quite clichee.- Plot. Beginning was good. The rest.. okay. The execution wasn't always good - sometimes too light-hearted, and not that consistent atmoshpere.Cons:- Too big adventage for elemental users.- Too big focus on the combat, not on the plot development. The fights are challenging on normal difficulty, but once you have to repeat 5 fights 3 times each to advance the plot a little, it becomes tiresome. Especially since the combat is kind of repetetive. (played as a Knight and a Marksman)- Pixel hunting puzzles.- Lack of interface for crafting.- The way mouse is raycasted over objects. Sometimes I would have to move my mouse to an exact spot to hit a monster, otherwise I would use Action Points trying to walk behind it before attacking.In the end I think it is a well made game, but not a revolutionary one. The game lacks a little bit of polish here and there. It has some 'novel' concepts, which should be interesting to those who weren't exposed to them before.But I don't think this game deserves 10/10. Maybe compared to nowdays RPG titles, yes. But compared to broader RPG experience, I'd say it's 7/10.			"

												I am completely enthralled with this game :)And as I'm progressing in my age :O that does not happen all that often anymore...First of all, I will admit that fans of the series, or simply people familiar with the previous installments, are surely more likely to get more out of this title :) But isn't that always true? And is it a ""con?"" That said, it being a prequel - it is absolutely unnecessary for anyone to play any of the previous games ;)Meeting old pals, or in this case, ""premet"" pals (like preheated or precooked or something? :O), references to some special quests (the healing conundrum, anyone? :D), and other lore quirks that transcend all the titles - the game is brimming with those! And I absolutely adored the original Divinie Divinity - one of my first crpgs I have ever played to completion and with multiple playthroughs. Some of the other sequels to the original were... let's just say, they were trying different approaches. But finally, Larian Studios struck gold, by creating this masterpiece of a game :)I have spent about 10 hours in this new version of the realm of Rivellon and I haven't even moved out of the starting hub xD Really! I have scouted every nook and cranny of this little town, discovering its secrets and easter eggs :D And if the remainder of the content is anything like the starting town, the game is just huge! But not as much in area as in detail, and I find that to be a much more valuable trait - one often ignored in times of vast, open-world games, which offer size, but not quality :/The sneaking system - OMG, so funny! Metal Gear Solid references there I can see... is what Yoda would have said... :O Anyways, there is plenty of these innuendoes, references to other games, to life in general. At one point, the two main heroes, who are your avatars (yes, you lead two characters, but you command a larger party later on), comment on how ridiculous it is, that they can't jump over a simple rope to get to a loot chest. And in fact, nothing can be done to the rope, and there is no way to go around it with the chest being on a pier. But there is a way to get to the loot :)And this is the next thing I want to talk about. These days, when developers say ""multiple choices, multiple approaches, multiple endings,"" I usually cringe, because the word multiple often does not go beyond the number two... sometimes 3... but, I guess, technicially, 3 qualifies as multpile... -.- Anyway, in Divinity: Original Sin, if you can think it, you can probably do it :) Well obviously, I'm exaggerating, but what is not exaggerated, though, is the word multiple in this game ;) Sneaking, and stealing, using your characters as distractions to divert the line of sight of unsuspecting owners, suffering the consequences if caught and reaping the benefits, if not, could be a game on its own :) And I loved, when I looted yet another painting off a wall (I found them to be a great source of income!) and my partner congratulated me on yet another heist well done. Usually in those random conversations the options are only binary, however, they each have a consequence which often reflects in a trait in permanent stats of the characters.And yes the stats! Talents, abilities, skills.... so many things to make each character unique, offering infinite replayability. And the number of classes has also increased, when compared to other Divinity RPGs. Most of your talents affect one another, not just spells, interacting with the environment, but other traits as well - charisma, speed, leadership, luck - there are so many factors to affect your gameplay, yet it is all seemlessly blended in, so that you always intuitively know which stat to boost and which to ignore (telekinesis FTW, though! It reminded me so much of the original Divinity :D).Only, if the game was more graphically pleasing... Just kidding - it is truly gorgeous! The world is rich and detailed, as is the whole game. The depth of field does wonders at closer zoom, the characters are nicely outlined, so that it is never too confusing during the battles.... Oh, yes! The fighting system.Now, turn-based is the way to go in classic crpgs, in my opinion. Trigger-happy button smashing is fun, but for action-adventure games. For RPGs, which aim at a longer gameplay, richer plot, multitude of side-quests, a turn-based system fits better into the general mechanic and is consistent with the source behind cRPGs - the actual role-playing games, which obviously are based on the dice ;) With the amount of interactivity between the various talents and the environment, this particular system makes each encounter a unique experience. And again, the game rewards clever thinking, choosing the path less traveled by, which may be less obvious, too, but offers a more visceral final scores :)Scores... Have I talked about the music already? No, and I should have started with that - it is gorgeous, no wait, already used gorgeous... mesmerizing, yes! It is mesmerizingly beautiful. There are lovely new scores, as well as some tracks from the orignal Divine Divinity, whose soundtrack is often praised to this day! And some of the tracks are even variations on those original tracks! It's so nice when you hear the tavern music, or the Rivertown farmlands choiry march one more time and it actually has some twist to it :) The music in the Divnity titles has always been of high quality, and this legacy is well-kept still.I have mentioned rewarding clever thinking. I think, coming to a close here, that the success of this game is the best kind of a reward for the clever thinking the developers have resorted to in creating this title :) It is a true spiritual successor to the highly acclaimed Divine Divinity - both in mechanics, interactivity of the environment, a unique twist on the classical fantasy paradigm, but - above all - in the range of options that is given to the player to progress in the game. There is a million other things I probably wanted to have said but did not... and remember, I only experienced the very beginning :) Larian Studios has long saught to find a formula to repeat their initial success - I strongly believe they have found one :)Congratulations to them, and salutations to all of you - I hope you are, or will be, as satisfied with Divinity: Original Sin as I am.

												Divinity: Original Sin is a fantastic game.  I can't recommend it enough.  I grew up playing the older turn-based RPGs such as Torment and Baulder's Gate, as well as the Fallout series so this game was right up my alley.  Even if you've never played a turn-based RPG you owe it to yourself to check it out.  The graphics are really good for the genre and the spell effects are great.  The sound quality was also pretty good except the background characters' lines got annoying...""nobody has as many friends as the man with many cheeses"" and ""How did you find Hiberheim this time of year my dear.... cold, very cold""   will be forever etched into my memory as well as other lines too numerous to count.  The game is LONG.  I played around 100 hours, doing almost all of the side quests.  There is loot galore in addition to the ability to craft some very strong armors.  I didn't explore crafting into late into the game however adding element resistances to armor was extremely helpful in the endgame.  I also crafted some rings to boost Constitution on a couple of characters to make up for deficiencies.This game was a joy to play and I am really looking forward to see what Larian comes up with next.

												TL;DR --> Superb game, you won't regret the purchaseThis is a fantastic game that is rich in content and attention to detail.  It looks fantastic and the art style reminds me what ""Baldurs Gate"" looked like when it first came out.  But over and above all the cosmetic excellence, lies the heart of the beast.  The gameplay.  oh and what a brilliant heart it is that beats in the core of this gem!Turn based battles require strategic thinking and clever combinations of the elemtns at hand.  You will not soon forget the first time you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat with the combination of a well placd poison cloud, followed by a flare that causes a massive explosion that wipes out multiple enemies!

												Phenominal game. Music, graphics, gameplay, voice acting (even the annoying archeologist). Even though the combat is turn based its action is mezmorizing. The way they have woven many NPC's fate together keep you guessing whats next or who done it. Anyone loving Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale style games will love this. Its hard to put down. I don't know what it is but I just love the fact that you always have a key to the door or chest, whether in the form of a key, lockpick or brute strength, my favorite having Madora smash something into oblivion. The ""effects"" that npc's are put under add depth to combat, a group of Orcs standing in a puddle causing them to be ""wet"" now you get to zap them with electricity for extra damage/stunning but be careful. If you are within that same puddle you feel the effects too. Another aspect which is wonderful, keeping you on your toes.			"

												Playing Divinity honestly felt like playing Dungeons and Dragons with a fairly creative DM who managed to ♥♥♥♥ up some times. The game is a turned based magic and sorcery RPG, with a lot of bizarre magic interactions. Let's say that there's a fire in your way. Casting rain will put out the fire, leaving behind a steam cloud that blocks line of sight and a bunch of puddles. Casting lightning on the puddles will then cause them to be electrified, stunning anyone who walks over them. There are all sorts of elemental interactions like this can make for fairly deep and nuanced combat. The story is fairly compelling, with a well realized world and interesting intrigue between different players. I played through this game 100% coop and think that it deserves to be lauded for making a deep RPG with an interesting story that actively encourages people to work together. I feel that that's the next step for gaming. We've had plenty of Left 4 Dead-ish action co op games, but now I feel that story-oriented coop can become a real thing. But unfortunately, the game needs some simple UI adjustments to become a bit more coop friendly. If you have two different people doing two different things in a game, then you need to clearly deliver all plot essential dialogue to both players. Often I'd be off crafting something and my partner would go and have an important conversation and I'd be left wondering what the heck was going on. Considering that the game gives you a teleport pyramid thing early on, it really wouldn't have hurt to pull the other player to important dialogues the moment they started (and to pop a dialogue window for both players the moment said dialogue began). Another problem is that the game's puzzles are completely awful. Any puzzle where you have to run around a room looking for a button to press (which usually is impossible to see with the default camera angle) is not really a puzzle at all. Portal 2 taught us that group puzzle solving can be incredibly fun and there are moments when I got that same high of being able to figure out a solution and brag about it, but those moments were heavily outweighed by the pixel hunt puzzles. With a little more polish in these departments, this would have been a superb game. As it stands right now, I'd call it a pretty good game (maybe even a REALLY good game) that is certainly moving in the right direction. If they make an expansion pack, I'll certainly get it.			"

												Very enjoyable, quite funny at times. The combat, while turn based, is quite challenging and difficult - I find myself quicksaving all the time... ALL THE TIME, so that I can redo fights to get better results. There are difficulty settings for people who don't enjoy combat that's quite that tough, and I would recommend reading a beginners guide that doesn't have any spoilers in it, just to make the overall experience more interesting - the tutorial dungeon only teaches combat and not some of the other game mechanics. Definitely thumbs up. :)			"

												I have had a blast playing this game. I have been waiting for a top down RPG that can stand next to titles like Baldur's Gate.Depth. Something that is rare these days.The coop experience is among the best if not THE best I have ever tried. See where your partner is aiming that spell. Travel wherever you want without your party. You and your buddy can even create your characters on the same screen. Watch him/her color his mohawk pink and adjust head types.Dont let turn based scare you away from this one (it almost did for me). The combat is enjoyable; I am still having fun with even the little fights.			"

												This is without a doubt the best isometic RPG i've played since the 90s.It is a very well made game well worth the full $40 price tag. The $9.99 DLC however is nothing more then some talking underwear and an item that lets you recolor things gold, if you don't buy it you are not missing anything; this kind of DLC is something i'd expect to see priced at $0.99 and not for $9.99... Only buy the DLC if you feel compelled to support the developer more.That aside, this game is still amazing well made! It has a good length campaign too; so far I've got almost 80 hours into and I still havn't finished my first play through. There is also workshop support and with the potential for modding the game it could have same major reply value for as long as the community keeps it going.			"

												Baldur's Gate with a splash of XCOM. Linear and not particularly repeatable, but a good co-op diversion with a dedicated partner.No cover drawn from its XCOM heritage, but tactical combat control and lockdowns are the order of the day. Scoundrels, Men at Arms, and Expert Marksmen are effectively 'mages in armor', with broad spell variety saved for dedicated INT casters, who will have a few skill trees due to less attribute dependence. Spend some time studying the character generation and level up systems, as understanding how tightly you will need to specialize is vital - the game is parsimonious with stat improvements. The tactical combat will pull no punches though the AI can sometimes be baited into foolish mistakes of positioning. Get friendly with your quicksave key, and put a grin on - the combat can be brutal, and a winning contest can go south quickly when new enemy abilities make their first appearance. D:OS won't warn you about what's coming.For mages doing damage, elemental combinations are the order of the day, and being able to apply all of the earth(poison)/fire and water/air(electricity) pairings is useful, but specialize in one pairing. Countering these works as you might imagine - water dries up when heated, fire goes out when rained upon. Be able to counter them all, amongst your group. Poison can be burned off (explosively!). Ice will melt, faster with help. Witchcraft is the INT caster version of Man-at-Arms, with fewer controls, but more ranged debuffs and pet summons - an armored decapitator appearing behind enemy lines is nothing to sneer at. (Nor are the various elementals and animals from the elemental skills, for that matter, but one summon per caster at a time.)The writing is adequate, but not stellar. The first who-dun-it wasn't particularly inspiring, and oftentimes progression has been a matter of ""what level are those enemies?"" rather than a cohesive sense of direction and progress. The quest journal is next-to-useless for many quests, providing little or no information to follow up. Use markers liberally, and don't be ashamed to augment the game's lacking journalling with some of your own. If you're doing every quest, expect to either miss a few things or need a walkthrough/guide from time to time.The rock-paper-scissors mechanic for the 'persuasion minigame' is by turns novel and tiresome. It's cute the first couple of times you see it, and it's a new way to 'randomize' a mechanic that no one seems to get right (persuasion) but it misses the mark in not having an ""autoplay"". Frankly, I don't want to play RPS against the computer, or my partner, and if the point is to provide some uncertainty to 'speech checks', that's fine - but I don't care for the minigame much. Fortunately, it's been relatively rare thus far...Character control is relatively straightforward - two players control four characters between them, in any combination. The host controls who gets to run which, allowing one player to AFK while the other plays a combat or to allow a tactical novice to mind only a single character in combat, etc. Wife and I split our characters into two teams of two, and it works out well - I run the NPC warrior Madora (man-at-arms) and shadow cleric (witchcraft/some water/man-at-arms), she handles the mage duties (one in all colleges for access, specializing earth/fire for stronger effects) and the sneaky rogue Wolgraff we recruited.Combat is turn based and is the real meat of the game, with players asked to deploy skills and weapons to defeat foes in a number of varied battlefield conditions. Often, a different approach or tactical plan is the difference between victory and reloading, and fights have been challenging often.All around, an enjoyable game, but remember those roots - the game doesn't pretend to be a more modern RPG, no matter the pretty graphics, so study up on how the level system works. It doesn't pretend to have autopilot combat, either. Bring your tactical thinking to the table....and get ready to read, because this is a long, slow march, not a sprint.Edit:Bugs, however, abound. Often, we notice desync issues when the host reloads the game and player #2's characters appear to have no stats (base scores all reset to 5) and not be wearing their gear, etc. We've not experienced any corruption from these episodes, but save often to avoid screams of hair-rending frustration when player 2 says ""My character is bugged. Again."" I'm amazed this wasn't caught and corrected, given how prevalent it's been for us!We've seen a couple of minor oddities (one bug involved a repeatedly-exploding poison gas trap that killed a boss in a single round because the poison would detonate, leave a fire puddle, the gas would refill the area, detonate... The boss standing in the cloud never took a combat turn - the explosion cycle took himn from 100% to 0% in one round of chained, buggy explosions (not that I'm complaining).Learn how to temper armor and weapons, learn how to make basic equipment (Madora makes a decent smith) and you can take advantage of movement speed penalty reductions on heavy armor and enhanced basic damage on weapons (for free). Don't play 'hard mode' if you don't have to!If you're into RPGs this one's worth a look, but don't expect all the rough corners to be filed down or a 100% bug-free experience, because they're not and it's not.

												Divinity: Original Sin has two very big thumbs up from me.  It's one of the best RPG's I've played in a long, long time. That said, there certainly are a few issues which I'm sure will be remedied over time.  The responsiveness and care that Larian has put into the release and post release of this product is second to none.The freedom that the player has while clumsily wandering throughout the very large and immersive world is unparalleled.  Being able to do whatever I want, whatever I want - good or bad is powerful.  That kind of freedom really allows the player to be a part of the world and really drive where the game goes (or doesn't go).Aside from some intrusive tutorial stuff and some weird UI management - the game is pretty spectacular.  I know I'll be playing it for a while to come and I've already sunk over 90 hours into it. "

Early Access Review
								A decidedly old school RPG with all the modern trappings you'd come to expect from a 2014 game. This game takes place in a very lovingly detailed world that is not just a set piece for you to blast your way through using one of the various classes at your disposal. This game handles that much differently taking a slow and deliberate story based approach to things. I think all in all this amazing game reminds me very much of Neverwinter Nights 1 which honestly is one of the best compliments I could pay to any RPG. This game is destined to be one of the best true RPG's of 2014, hands down and is a nice return to how RPG games used to be made.			"

												I don't usually play these types of RPGs, turn based combat isn't exactly my cup of tea. I have been known to play a few now and then but I'm rather picky. This one just blows the rest out of the water. It's amazingly intricate and detailed and extremely immersive. I love how it doesn't hold your hand through the quests and you have to figure things out for yourself. I haven't been playing very long at all, just started out actually, but I fell in love with it and I'll be dedicating a poo ton of my free time to this game.			"

												Completed in sub 60 hours. Very fun gameplay but the story and the puzzles are not flawless. Behind all the bugs and the hidden buttons and levers you MUST find to progress the game it was amazingly fun. A CO-OP playthrough is recommended since alot this game has to offer targets coop solely. Not quite as good as the grandfathers of D&D style of RPG's like Baldur's Gate, Icewind dale or Planescape torment, but it is certainly worth the money. instead of buying packs in Hearthstone, support these indie-developers and hope the love for old-school RPG's will be rekindled.

												First few hours in the game and really loving it.  Familiar interface with no senseless learning 'how to play' and well scripted voiced story.  Two real strengths I would stress:1: truly co-oprative game with two main characters each contributing to the story as well as the fighting.2: Unusual 'cartoon-painting' style introduction which I really liked.4/5			"

												Divinity Original Sin is old-school-style RPG, with a rich atmosphere, lots of character-building, turn-based combat and excellent coop-support where you (or you and a friend) play as the two main-characters, called the ""source-hunters"".TLDR-version: I definitly recommend this game to all non-casual RPG fans, for it highly depends on much reading and using ones own wits to solve or even find quests.[4/5] Gameplay The gameplay as it is would be perfect. You have interesting combat (more on that later), trading and dialouge options with almost every character in the world, a gripping story and huge freedom in terms of character-building. Battle-mage that vanishes like a rouge during combat? No problem. The typical grumpy, know-it-all wizard with devasting spells? Of course. A weak charismatic healer with almost no combat skills? Here you go.There regullary are dialouges between the two heros, where you can define their attitude towards each other and their nature.So the observing reader may ask: Why only 4 out of 5 stars? Well the gameplay experience is hindered by some bugs from time to time (not that often). There is for example a bug, that lets the attributes and breastplate of your controlled hero disappear (only on your client). The host has to save the game and reload it to fix it. Or there is this bug that prevent you from hitting enemies that are to close to rocks or walls (only had this bug twice in my playtime).With these bugs fixed the gameplay would be perfect.[5/5] Combat The combat is round-based. Normally I prefer real-time combat over turn-based, but Divinity: Original Sin is an exception I guess. The combat is incredibly complex (yet easy, don't get me wrong!), so the turn-based system lets you use the terrain and fight very strategicaly. There are tons of different spells and lots of different weapon styles. You can (with the right talent) backstab enemies for extra damage or create a oil surface and inflame that, teleport an enemy into that burning surface, electrify water sufaces or steam-clouds, the possiblities are endless.[4.5/5] Controls Not much to say about the controlls. One could say good controlls don't come to your attention and that's the case here. The game is mainly controlled with the mouse, though there are shortcuts for the spells in your hotbar, the inventory...The only problem that occured to me is that when you try to get some item out of an poisoned/burning/electrified area and you can't reach it from out of that area, your hero steps into it and (especially in the begining of your journey) dies. So you have to be careful...[3.5/5] AIThe AI in this game controlls your character when you are walking by clicking on the ground instead of holding the left mouse button to guide him or her. It does a decent job at that, avoiding hazardous areas or traps, as long as it is able to (see ""controlls"").The AI of enemies on the other hand somtimes is quite dumb. For example: It attacked my main character until he had 20hp left. Now it could have killed him with another successful hit. Instead it started attacking my companions and ended up losing that fight.Sometimes I'm quite thankful for quirks like that, for the fights can be really hard from time to time, yet it feels ""wrong"", if you know what i mean.Often the AI beautifully combines spells and terrain effects, creating challenging fights without feeling unfair. Many times there was that ""WTF?!"" effect when an enemy shot an poison arrow at my group and in the next turn a mage set it on fire, nearly wiping the party.[5/5] Immersion What can I say about this one, except it is perfect? The dialouges are interesting and you can have them with literally every person on the map (except the mobs of course...). A certain talent allows you to speak with animals, which often have an intersting story to tell, a funny sentence (Imagine a rooster saying: ""Soon the cleaver of decapitation will be turned upon you, the revolution is coming!!""), or even tips on how to solve puzzles.[5/5] MapAll of the levels are beautiful designed and contain many details. There are hidden secrets and treasure, quests off the beaten path. Could you ask for more?[4.5/5] GraphicsThe graphics are held in a isometric view and rotatable by some 90°, but you can zoom in really close and look your hero into the eyes (while having a cool blurred background). The game nicely plays with different ambient lighting and weather effects. The spell effects are solid, not always brilliant, but definitly nice. Some of the animations are kind of clunky, yet they do not destroy the atmosphere or immersion.[4/5] AudioThe game has a amazing soundtrack, that beautifully accompanies combat, travel or dialgoues. All the other audio is solid, but sometimes repetitive.Take for example the marketplace of the first city, where you will spend very much time. All of the merchants have a few lines they say, some funny, some serious. But they repeat that few lines over and over again.After hearing ""No one has as many friends, as the man with the many cheeses!"" for the 40th time you have an urge to slaughter that man, believe me. Only a few of the dialouges are spoken, but considering the vast amount of dialouges I guess it's ok. Yet, everything that is spoken is done very well.[NA/5] DevelopersI had no contact with the developers.Though it has some flaws this game is definitly worth buying. It is highly addictive, especially in coop. Divinity: Original Sin is one of my favourite games of all time.Final Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars - Fix the bugs and some of the minor flaws and this game is perfection.			"

												On a IGN scale this would be a 15/10.  No really, if you like the ""oldschool"" rpg's, don't mind some reading, love developing your own characters how you want, tactical combat (with Action Points).  Story isn't bad but isn't amazing (though I'm not quite finished yet).  It's quite a long game with lots of exploration.  These are my favorite types of games so I am really glad they are making a comeback by means of Kickstarter, etc.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only played a few hours of the alpha, but those few hours has been really enjoyable and I will see myself playing this game a lot once it is fully released. I would play it a lot more during the alpha stage if I weren't forcing myself to not play it to avoid spoling the game by playing it way too much prior to release.If they keep up the good work on incoming patches and adding all the promised content, then this game will be well worth the money and be playable for hundreds of hours for people like me who loves turn-based strategy games.I suspect that the turn-based combat is what will keep many people from buying this game since turn-based usually means slow-paced combat, which sadly... many people dislike.But if you can handle turn-based combat, then I would suggest you to keep an eye on this game as it goes in to further states and nears completition, cause if they hold up to theire promises of content then this game will become great and I will hugely recommend it for anyone who likes turn-based combat and RPG, but I will also recommend it for people who likes RPG and would like to give turn-based a chance, this might be something that gets them in to liking the genre.

								Really good turn-based RPG, which gave the same feel and enjoyment as in games like: KoToR (I and II), dragon age and baldur's gate.people who should buy it at this moment: - you can handle alpha gameplay (crashes, incomplete gameplay mechanics, etc.)- you like turn based combat- you like a game with as many conversations as fights. (if not more :P)- you like micro-management of inventoryPeople who shouldn't buy this game at this moment:- invert the afore mentioned.Good features:- compelling story- have the freedom to kill everyone- great (semi) - turn based combat mechanicsBad features:- slow travel speed- unclear quest progression (this game doesn't hold your hand with quest markers which tends to get time consuming)			"

								Very entertaining game. I supported this game from the moment I heard about it. Whilst it is just in Alpha, the game will prove to be a gold star once it's finished. The various bugs that occure are mostly hard to notice and the communication system is a bit under-developed. But, I do suggest this game for anyone looking for a classic revamp of a turn based rpg.			"

												[Please note: I reserve to change this review as I proceed in the adventure and as game patches come in].Divinity: Original Sin is a solid classic-style RPG, focused on co-op play (but absolutely enjoyable in solo play as well) with very modern graphics and with *lots* of things to do. A first thing to consider: this game is hard if you compare it to most contemporary titles -- you will die multiple times if you are not careful, trust me, so save often! -- and it does not take you by hand, it lets you explore the world and do what you like, when you like it; it feels old-school in a way, but at the same time extremely fresh. And speaking of it, the game world is enormous and should provide from 60 to 100 hours of fun, even without considering any of the user generated content that fans will provide on the Steam Workshop.The levelling system is classless so you can literally become anything you like (although the game delivers tens of starting archetypes if you don't want to mess too much with all the traits and abilities): for example, you can start as a warrior and acquire magical skills later in the game as you level up and assign points accordingly.Combat is tactical and turn-based and therefore quite complex... but don't worry, it's fun and you can plan your next move without being in a hurry!The post-launch lack of ""AI personalities"" for your party members has been fixed, and therefore now in singleplayer you can enjoy dialogues and banter with your own party members without having to pick all lines for everybody. :POverall I'm very impressed with this game, and I am looking forward to play it for much time to come. If you like CRPGs like me... get it, you won't be disappointed.My vote: 9 / 10			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is reminiscent of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and all those great D&D based games from the 90's. The only difference is the turn based combat which doesn't detract from the game itself. I myself dislike turn based combat, but found that in Divinity, the combat was a very entertaining aspect.In the above list of games, if you spent time pausing combat, planning moves and then executing them, then Divinity: Original Sin will handle that just fine with it's turn based combat. The isometric (yes, isometric) views are gorgeous, and you can zoom in and get pretty up close and personal with the rest of the world. Speaking of views, you can disable it and have a full 360 view, but the main campaign doesn't recommend it due to, ""graphical artefacts"". However, when player made campaigns get released, they will hopefully make full use of the 360 immersion.Gameplay wise, the world is immersive and expansive. Characters are rather believable, and the choices you make do impact the rest of the world. I have yet to experience these choices, but my gut feeling tells me that some of the people I helped, shunned or let go will come back to haunt me in the future. At some points, you'll get inter-party conversations, which are nice, but some of them add a little twist to the gameplay. Depending on your choices, characters will gain trait points which can apply different bonuses to your character, or party. For instance, if you have a person who demonstrated good leadership, they'll inspire the rest of your team. However, if a conversation later down the line makes that same character act like less of a leader, they can lose that leadership trait.The game world is both expansive and immersive. The nice paintings in people's houses are very decorative... and profitable. A quick sleight of hand, and practically every object can belong to you. Broomsticks turn into weapons, buckets turn into helmets, pillows can be cut open and their feather's taken. Barrels and boxes can be moved to create some barricades to help with a battle, or to block traps. The amount of detail put into the environment and how you interact with it is astonishing. If you were like me, and were awaiting a game to astound and captivate you like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, Divinity: Original Sin won't disappoint. So far, everything in the game has been executed very well and has been polished rather nicely. I'm looking forward to delving further into the game world, and then experiencing it with online with other players.			"

												Has a cat romance quest, 10/10.Seriously, though, Divinity: Original Sin, is one of the finest RPGs I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Clever writing (though, the constant talking of the NPCs in the town can get annoying, they have a tendency to talk over each other), a quite pleasing art style and more stats and skills than you can shake a wizard staff at! Having the two main characters interact is also a great roleplaying mechanic, either with a friend, or even alone.The combat, especially, is a real treat. Turn-based, eschewing mana or other resources in favour of an Action Point system, a la the old X-COM. Enemies are tough and their favourite past-time is chopping adventurers to bits, so you'll need to use your skills intelligently, especially considering magic and their assorted elemental combos.Overall, a few minor nuisances here and there aside, Original Sin is a splendid game, well worth your time, especially if you feel casting cold spells in the rain should do more than just increase damage.

												Divinity: Original Sin is the latest entry in the Divinity series of games, chronologically following Divinity: Dragon Commander and preceeding the events of Divine Divinity.  It is also an unbelievably good game and you should play it immediately.Maybe I should explain.Original Sin chronicles the tale of two Source Hunters, inquisitorial figures who have been granted vast authority by the Council of Seven, as they travel the world of Rivellon.  The premise is well-trod in other games; crusaders questing to destroy dark Sourcerers, who must face dire threats while keeping themselves from becoming the very monsters they yadda yadda yadda.But this is a Divinity game.  This is the direct sequel to the game wherein you played an army commander who was also a dragon wearing a jetpack.Rivellon is an incredible world to explore- one part hilarious, one part tragic, two parts engrossing.  After you've made your way through the tomb which serves as a tutorial, the game world is simply open, the tasks blinking in your journal neither pushing nor pulling.  In our playthrough, my friend and I have found ourselves moving through the world like water; taking the most interesting paths of least resistance and criss-crossing the map in crazed fashion.  Against the backdrop of a town Councillor's murder, we helped a cat find love, or fought the ghosts of pirates, or battled our way slowly through a monsterous hellscape on a whim.  Every screen has something noteworthy taking place on it, even if it's not immediately obvious what,  and NPC conversations, dialogue, environmental cues and short in-game books are meshed seamlessly into a dramatic and intriguing whole.As far as the cliche-sounding plotline goes, the story may surprise you.  Nearly as soon as the mundane primary quests begin, they are interwoven with a metaplot on a cosmic level- but they remain fulfilling and well-done stories.  Every named character has a tale, and many of them are well-developed and emotional enough to give you an unusual sense of connection to the character.  After a few hours into the story, the game washes its hands of any responsibility it has to give you moral cues, and it pulls no punches with the complexity of the situations you're forced to resolve on a whim.  Lives and fortunes often depend upon a moment's indecision, and entire populations can be decimated due to a loss at rock-paper-scissors.(I did remind you that this was a Divinity game.  How else would you resolve social conflicts?)It might be more helpful to think of Divinity: Original Sin as a complex and interwoven series of events rather than a quest.  Most of the situations throughout the world are resolvable through several vectors, and the whole narrative can shift and adapt as you resolve things 'out of order' or shank a hapless character who caught you pawing through their storeroom.  Plots and schedules in the game world exist with some degree of independance- so when I accidentally set a fishing boat on fire and was forced to slay all of the enraged dockworkers, I cut away the thread which would have led me to the location of the mutineer who'd stolen a valuable artifact... but I came across him later anyway.Speaking of killing, combat in this game is interesting in a way I've seldom seen before.  Proper fights are turn-based, and unbelievably dynamic and well-balanced.  No abilities are lost on the live-time overworld, however, and so encounters can be started after hurling a fireball at an unwitting group, or re-arranging the scenery to form barricades.  Fights are dangerous affairs- the game does not beleive in pulling punches, and being outnumbered is a threat which must be countered with cunning tactics and even emergant changes of planning.  No more dangerous than the world itself, though.  Rivellon is riddled with traps, puzzles and (well) riddles, and a lapse in attention can mean the death of even an over-levelled party.  Death is a serious matter- ressurection scrolls are real, but rare, and even those won't help you if your entire party goes up in flames.  This is a key element of the game; that the things happening on-screen are things you have to pay attention to, lest you walk blithely into the basement of a paranoid trap-maker or idly break a barrel full of oil while an open fire is alight nearby.  Finally, the multiplayer element is excellent.  While (by default, anyway) only two people can play the same game, each one has full control over a character, and frequent opportunities for choices by each player helps to tailor the character to fit both desires.  The game's plot is built with a dual protagonist in mind, and teamwork is absolutely required in even the most routine battles.  Best of all, the game's interconnectivity system allows players to swap items or teleport to the other in a flash, giving each hero freedom to wander the world map while retaining the ability to show up and participate in combat.Are there problems with this game?  Of course, but they're blessedly minor.  The game has a few more bugs than you might expect, and load times between areas are long.  It's also easy to skip side-quests, and some of the more important ones contain puzzles sufficiently obscure to create serious problems for some players- plus, though the game lets you do what you want and ignore what you don't, skipping the wrong side-quests can cause serious problems later on.  Finally, the game's NPCs have a solid reprotoire of relevant and witty dialog... which they will repeat, ad infinitum.  This can quickly come to grate on the senses, and I have legitimately killed NPCs merely to make them shut up.Still, these substantive quibbles are minor.  Divinity: Original Sin, is one of the most solid RPG titles which I've seen in years, and more fun to boot.			"

												Baldur's Gate with a splash of XCOM. Linear and not particularly repeatable, but a good co-op diversion with a dedicated partner.No cover drawn from its XCOM heritage, but tactical combat control and lockdowns are the order of the day. Scoundrels, Men at Arms, and Expert Marksmen are effectively 'mages in armor', with broad spell variety saved for dedicated INT casters, who will have a few skill trees due to less attribute dependence. Spend some time studying the character generation and level up systems, as understanding how tightly you will need to specialize is vital - the game is parsimonious with stat improvements. The tactical combat will pull no punches though the AI can sometimes be baited into foolish mistakes of positioning. Get friendly with your quicksave key, and put a grin on - the combat can be brutal, and a winning contest can go south quickly when new enemy abilities make their first appearance. D:OS won't warn you about what's coming.For mages doing damage, elemental combinations are the order of the day, and being able to apply all of the earth(poison)/fire and water/air(electricity) pairings is useful, but specialize in one pairing. Countering these works as you might imagine - water dries up when heated, fire goes out when rained upon. Be able to counter them all, amongst your group. Poison can be burned off (explosively!). Ice will melt, faster with help. Witchcraft is the INT caster version of Man-at-Arms, with fewer controls, but more ranged debuffs and pet summons - an armored decapitator appearing behind enemy lines is nothing to sneer at. (Nor are the various elementals and animals from the elemental skills, for that matter, but one summon per caster at a time.)The writing is adequate, but not stellar. The first who-dun-it wasn't particularly inspiring, and oftentimes progression has been a matter of ""what level are those enemies?"" rather than a cohesive sense of direction and progress. The quest journal is next-to-useless for many quests, providing little or no information to follow up. Use markers liberally, and don't be ashamed to augment the game's lacking journalling with some of your own. If you're doing every quest, expect to either miss a few things or need a walkthrough/guide from time to time.The rock-paper-scissors mechanic for the 'persuasion minigame' is by turns novel and tiresome. It's cute the first couple of times you see it, and it's a new way to 'randomize' a mechanic that no one seems to get right (persuasion) but it misses the mark in not having an ""autoplay"". Frankly, I don't want to play RPS against the computer, or my partner, and if the point is to provide some uncertainty to 'speech checks', that's fine - but I don't care for the minigame much. Fortunately, it's been relatively rare thus far...Character control is relatively straightforward - two players control four characters between them, in any combination. The host controls who gets to run which, allowing one player to AFK while the other plays a combat or to allow a tactical novice to mind only a single character in combat, etc. Wife and I split our characters into two teams of two, and it works out well - I run the NPC warrior Madora (man-at-arms) and shadow cleric (witchcraft/some water/man-at-arms), she handles the mage duties (one in all colleges for access, specializing earth/fire for stronger effects) and the sneaky rogue Wolgraff we recruited.Combat is turn based and is the real meat of the game, with players asked to deploy skills and weapons to defeat foes in a number of varied battlefield conditions. Often, a different approach or tactical plan is the difference between victory and reloading, and fights have been challenging often.All around, an enjoyable game, but remember those roots - the game doesn't pretend to be a more modern RPG, no matter the pretty graphics, so study up on how the level system works. It doesn't pretend to have autopilot combat, either. Bring your tactical thinking to the table....and get ready to read, because this is a long, slow march, not a sprint.Edit:Bugs, however, abound. Often, we notice desync issues when the host reloads the game and player #2's characters appear to have no stats (base scores all reset to 5) and not be wearing their gear, etc. We've not experienced any corruption from these episodes, but save often to avoid screams of hair-rending frustration when player 2 says ""My character is bugged. Again."" I'm amazed this wasn't caught and corrected, given how prevalent it's been for us!We've seen a couple of minor oddities (one bug involved a repeatedly-exploding poison gas trap that killed a boss in a single round because the poison would detonate, leave a fire puddle, the gas would refill the area, detonate... The boss standing in the cloud never took a combat turn - the explosion cycle took himn from 100% to 0% in one round of chained, buggy explosions (not that I'm complaining).Learn how to temper armor and weapons, learn how to make basic equipment (Madora makes a decent smith) and you can take advantage of movement speed penalty reductions on heavy armor and enhanced basic damage on weapons (for free). Don't play 'hard mode' if you don't have to!If you're into RPGs this one's worth a look, but don't expect all the rough corners to be filed down or a 100% bug-free experience, because they're not and it's not.

												Divinity: Original Sin has two very big thumbs up from me.  It's one of the best RPG's I've played in a long, long time. That said, there certainly are a few issues which I'm sure will be remedied over time.  The responsiveness and care that Larian has put into the release and post release of this product is second to none.The freedom that the player has while clumsily wandering throughout the very large and immersive world is unparalleled.  Being able to do whatever I want, whatever I want - good or bad is powerful.  That kind of freedom really allows the player to be a part of the world and really drive where the game goes (or doesn't go).Aside from some intrusive tutorial stuff and some weird UI management - the game is pretty spectacular.  I know I'll be playing it for a while to come and I've already sunk over 90 hours into it. "

I am still very impressed with the the OMGAGE to the old style games with enough new stuff to make it really one of the best RPG's I have ever played.

Early Access Review
								I loved the concept of Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, but I could never get into that style of gameplay (even though I'm a hardcore KotOR fan). This game does an excellent job of delivering an RPG with elements very much like the classic Bioware titles and mixes in some contemporary features (but just enough to stay true to the old genre). Excellent graphics, witty dialogue (and there's a lot of it, even for it being currently in Beta), smooth combat (a bug here or there as expected), and a smack of nostalgia makes this game fit quite well in the hands of a player who spends far too much time in Elder Scrolls games. You want open-ended story with complex character crafting? Grab this. Grab the two originals as well.			"

												The most engrossing turn based combat I've played in years and an indie game with a lot of heart put into it. Highly interactive environments, a non-linear story and a strong (optional) multiplayer component are icing on the cake. Writing tends toward the tongue in cheek which normally doesn't suite me, but it's still a lot better than Skyrim for example and has quite a number of unexpected twists. Great fun. Can't wait for the mods to start coming out.			"

												A complex, deep, content-rich, new-oldschool cRPG that borrows heavily from such classics as Baldur's Gate series and Ultima VII. Crowdfunded title, that really delivered it's promises plus a lot more. Like great RPGs of the past, Divinity: Original Sin will certainly not hold your hand, demanding utmost attention from the player. I don't remember last time when I had to take handwritten notes so I won't forget certain hints and clues. Quirky game, not without it's flaws but well worth digging in.			"

												Okay, so intially I reviewed this game while it was still in beta, and I recommended it wholeheartedly, however, it has since been released in full, so I thought I would update my review to reflect that.This game is, for me, one of the best rpg's of recent times. Larian has always seemed, to me at least, like a studio with great ideas, but limited execution. With Original Sin however, they have absolutely smashed that perception of them. This game is no less than a masterpiece. The story is fairly rich, with deep characters, that have their own motives and personalities. It's also pretty damn funny, with many conversations (and in-game books) having genuine laugh-out-loud moments. The combat is intuitive, and well worked, although there are one or two small bugs with it when playing co-operatively, but nothing game or immersion breaking.The co-op is where this game shines more than most. It is simple, old fashioned, damn good fun. Co-op combat is great, with each player able to feel an important part of the battle, and using abilities to destroy your enemies together is great fun, for example; one player creates a pool of oil beneath your foe, the other then lights it on fire, or perhaps one player teleports an enemy up into the air, before slamming them down into the ground... right in front of your ally, and their massive sword. It rocks, on every level.So, long story short, if you like rpg's that inherit much from baldur's gate and neverwinter, like your games to be fun and funny in equal measure, enjoy co-op or just enjoy beating things in the head, this is a fantastic game. If you don't like any of those things, then this review probably isn't for you, because anyone that hipster would never do anything so mainstream as to read a review.Buy it if you like things.			"

												Not having played this game for very long. I am writing an early review of what I think of this game so far. I do recommend this game, although I will talk about both what I find good and bad.Divinity: Original Sin has a turn-based combat system. I find this combat style was very well done. It is difficult to choose the wrong place to attack if you are paying attention, and it takes strategy to get through the battles. They certainly are not battles that you want to rush into. However, there is certainly a lot of difficulty early on in Divinity: Original Sin. I currently am Level 3 and Level 3 creatures are very difficult for me. I do rely on my cleric and healing potions a lot to get through them, and even then a party member dies usually. So it is not a game for a casual player who wants to feel above the opposition. Although it is fun, and makes me think I should be more tactical before I turn a corner, and check for enemies.One issue I have is that quests rely heavily on what is in the dialogue between the characters, because the Journal you have does not depict location well at all and there are no markers. An example is searching for a Church of Legionnaires, and I do not know where this Church is and the Journal does not tell me where to go. It gets very confusing with the amount of dialogue you do before you get around to doing the quests.Although, the amazing variety of things to do is awesome. If you explore the first city enough, you manage to find qhat seems to be a second main questline that over-arcs everything. On the surfac, it seems like a lot of fun. A very confusing puzzle to piece togetehr as I play and go through this murder-mystery / source-hunting main quest line. Exploring more into the first main questline also opens up the door to more allies to add to your pack, something that becomes very useful early on due to the difficulty of battles.Divinity: Original Sin after only a few hours seems like such an amazing game. The story is intriguing and catches your interest, and the amount of stories raveled together layered as such makes me want to pour more of my time into it. The combat is fluent and makes you think and act slowly to survive, and when you do level-up it really feels like you have accomplished something.I highly recommend this game if you think you can handle the difficulty and amount of dialogue.

Excellent turn-based combat that plays quick and is tons of fun. Playing the campaign co-op is a top-notch experience.

												Divinity: Original Sin is an incredibly fun hardcore RPG. It is nothing like Diablo or Torchlight; if anything, it's more like Wasteland 2 (or 1) or the original Fallout 1 (or 2). It's best played with a friend. Please note that to create a co-op game, one player has to make a game with both players' characters. You don't just create a character and join your friend. You join your friend's game and take control of one of the characters (2-4, there are 2 main characters they create and you can recruit up to 2 other characters in the game, but personally I think the Lone Wolf perk is much better than another character). The game is absolutely MASSIVE. The first area in the game is a pretty big place with a surrounding area, and there's a place with LOTS of portals you activate later.Here are some tips to new players:- Steal every painting or gold ______ (such as Light Gold Cup) in the game! You can sell them for a lot, although this does make the money system rather unbalanced.- Make sure to have characters that can do more than one thing! For example, a rogue-type character is great but knives mainly do piercing damage, which does very little to undead monsters, and there are a lot of those!- Mages (Wizards, particularly) can be so useful, I'd almost call them overpowered. If you're going to be a mage, be sure to put points into every magic type (Aerothurge, Pyromancy, etc.); the more the better!- When you're making a character, absolutely look at every aspect of it! If you don't like the perks or the spells you start with, change them!- Last but not least, there are some Smelly Panties at the top of Esmeralda's house. They give Charisma +1.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is one of the best games I've played in a long time!As of writing, I'm almost 30 hours in, level 5 and just about ventured outside of the first city. There is a plethora of things to do and multitudes of people to talk to. In most games talking to people is boring and more of a chore than an enjoyment. However in this game I'm looking forward to the next dialogue and to see what people have to say, and to see how they react to my crazy decisions.I've read a couple of ""guides"" online, such as this is how you should play and this build is optimal. Bah! I'm having my own way and the game lets me do just that. I'm facing 9 same level monsters at once... died about 7 times before I got through it, but I learned that zombies heal from poison (and splash poison when you hit them!), but they freeze easily, especially when wet. But freezing everything makes the ground slippery and my guys keep tripping over it, so I melted the poison-ice mix with fire... and it exploded! Now everything is burning. Lets calm down and cast some rain. No more fire or ice, just lots of water, but my weapon has electricity! If I hit something, I stun my whole group, and the poison heals the zombies, but kills me.... I need a new tactic, lets try this again! Maybe oil will work?The combat is good, the dialogue is good, graphics are good and music is awesome! The quests are interesting with good twists and this is definitely more of an open sandbox than a linear game.			"

												I'm going to write this in the hopes that it persuades one of my buddies to buy it and play it with me, because this game would be an absolute blast in Cooperative mode.This is easily the best RPG that I've played in the last several years. It boasts a classic, orthographic RPG style with turn-based combat, and does it damn well. The game is very daunting at first due to its sheer depth. It doesn't hold your hand every step of the way. There are almost no actual quest markers, unlike in modern RPGs like Skyrim where you get a quest marker for every little thing. You have to read dialog and pay attention to details in order to know where to go and what to do. Quests are actually engaging, and battles take real strategizing and planning to win. The game has a much slower pace, but big battles can get pretty hectic, even though they're turn based.Character customization has tons of depth. You create TWO main characters at the start of a new game, and it even allows you to modify their base stats and perks to your liking. Unlike in many other games, classes do not ultimately define your characters. They simply determine what gear and abilities they start with. Obviously this wouldn't be the first game to do that, but I think it's a great system nonetheless.The inventory system is a lot like Diablo's, except the inventory space is only limited to a character's carry weight capacity, which can be increased via stat leveling. And since each member of your party has their own inventory, you can stock up on butt loads of loot. Buying/selling is more like bartering. You don't just go up to any random vendor and sell all your loot for tons of gold. Vendors actually have a finite amount of gold they can spend. However, you can trade any of your loot for an item provided you have enough to match the gold value of the item you're trying to acquire. In other words, you don't just farm gold like in Diablo.And now for the meaty part: combat. A lot of people will probably think of the older Final Fantasy games when they hear ""turn based."" Rather than transition from the game world to a setpiece for a battle, a grid of tiles appears right where you encounter your enemy, and you fight within that. Trying to exit the grid means fleeing from battle. Each character has a pool of action points (AP) that they consume per turn. Moving between tiles uses up points, and a higher encumberance means a higher AP cost for moving. Obviously, using abilities or basic attacks costs points too. They slowly regenerate per-turn, so having a party member hold for a turn will save points to allow them to use stronger abilities later on. There are stats and items that can increase the total points a character has, and the number regenerated per-turn. Once you are finished commanding your party, you end your turn, and the enemy proceeds with their strategy.The combat itself is astoundingly complex. Positioning is always important. Archers are more likely to miss the further they are from their target. Large enough obstructions will even prevent arrows and projectile spells from reaching their target. There are also tons of environmental elements that can either be your greatest ally or your worst enemy. Enemy AI WILL take advantage of it when you least expect it. If it's raining, characters will become wet, which makes them more susceptible to lightning and frost spells. There are other things like poison clouds which will ignite from flames (and, obviously, poison anyone who enters), and patches of ice that can cause characters who tread upon them to slip and fall, rendering them useless for a couple of turns. And there's plenty more. All of this complexity means that every battle you fight feels unique and engaging.The story isn't anything original, but it's written well regardless. There's plenty of whitty humor, and the small amount of voice acting in the game is done superbly. Basically, it's an easy-to-love classic fantasy story. Larian Studios was not worried about creating centuries of lore for a bunch of different races and religions and countries. The world of Divinity is simply perceived as, well, ""the world."" That doesn't mean there's a total lack of lore. There's just enough to give the story a framework so things make sense and things feel ""real."" But you still get a sense of epicness from the narrative. They focus on discovering the lost pasts of your characters, which keeps you invested since you basically CREATED your characters at the start.Anyway, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I won't give a X/10 rating since I think ratings are a joke. Hopefully my review is enough to give you an idea of how freakin' awesome I think this game is.Now will one of my friends BUY THIS GAME SO THEY CAN PLAY IT WITH ME?!			"

												This is a great game with a few issues.  Even with my negative points below I still recommend it for people who like RPG+Turn based battles, if you liked games like Baldur’s Gate series then you will likely enjoy this game.Good:+Great Graphics.+Moody atmosphere for dungeons.+Talk/trade with almost every neutral NPC.+Developers are listening to players and updates/patches are coming out frequently.Not so Good:-Inventory management is clunky.  Yes you can use ""Send to Homestead"" but I would love to see an option to access it from anywhere as well as quick transfer, say CTRL+left click to transfer to Homestead.  -Enemy visual range is so large that often you’re in battle before you can even see them.  Once in battle you often have to move the map around just to spot the enemy, since they are so spread out.-Quest tracking.  I know this was their intent but the lack of any visual clues and limited suggestions in quest log can make questing painful and slow.  I’ve spend a large amount of my time running between people in town asking the same questions and hoping for a different answer or quest update.  If there were better visual clues (pointer) or more details in quest log on what is expected next I wouldn’t feel some much like I’m wasting time running around.-Movement speed, I know this is subjective but for me I feel like the characters move too slowly even at max speed.-So far with my limited play it seems like the enemy count is too low on the maps, i.e. only one or two groups of enemies per map area.

Early Access Review
								Very entertaining game. I supported this game from the moment I heard about it. Whilst it is just in Alpha, the game will prove to be a gold star once it's finished. The various bugs that occure are mostly hard to notice and the communication system is a bit under-developed. But, I do suggest this game for anyone looking for a classic revamp of a turn based rpg.			"

												One of the best role-playing games I ever played. If there's something you want to do, the game will most likely allow it. There are minor irritating elements in the game, but overall it's a totally enjoyable experience. And one of the few games that grasped my attention for almost 100 hours.			"

												I've donated to a good number of crowdfunded/early access titles over the past year and Divinity: Original Sin is the first one of them that has officially launched and I just gotta say that they have set the bar extremely high (Hot Damn have they evah!) as far as this development trend goes. Their alpha was impressively polished a few months ago and it just got better as the days went on. Larian was so on point, it was sick (in the good way! :P). Now playing the official release is just pure joy.  I'm right back where I was in the 90s playing so many of the amazing cRPG titles that were so much fun and D:OS has brought that all back and then some.  Crowdfunding/EA has allowed Larian to make the game they always wanted to make with total creative freedom and it shows, ohmgosh does it show.Sure there have been some hiccups since launch with issues but there has also been a steady stream of updates as Larian listens to all the feedback and fixes the issues as they pop up.The modding toolkit is ready as well and just waiting for Valve to flip the switch so there is a whole lot more of the goodness to be had from talented modders out there. I am so stoked!			"

												This game is everything I love about video games. It's extremely engaging and a game that is enjoyed best with friends. You will start strategizing, planning out, and manuvering about how to make the best of a situation. You have complete freedom to do whatever it is you want, and your actions actually matter.The writing is as strong as the gameplay. Since the actions you take have real impactful outcomes, you will pay attention to what people are saying, which makes you really focused on the awesome quests there are. This game doesn't dumb anything down. It expects a lot of you. It's challenging, but never impossible. Being able to make the environment a strategic part of a fight feels natural and fun, and you will miss the combat system once you play other RPGs. You will want more, you will want to know what happens to the NPCs, you will want to defeat that boss, you will want to play this game all the time. Enjoy it while it's fresh. Take your time. Personally, it's my GoTY. There's no shame in recreating your characther after a while. I've restarted countless times, and I experience the game differently each time. It's the best game I've played. I wouldn't think twice about reccommending it to anyone who loves strategy and classic-style RPGs. Or anyone. "

												Though I'm only 18 hours in as of this point, I must say it is the best cRpg I've played... It might not mean much seeing as I've only played baldur's gate 2 and drakensang before this, but this game should set an example to all future RPG games. The interactivity is amazing, if it's not the ground/a building you can interact with it, and in many ways. Even things that would be trivial in other games like crates and barrels, load up your inventory with them, go into combat, and make a maze while you're in combat, or sneaking around and dropping them off while you scurry back a safe distance to initiate.Another thing that stands out is that EVERY stat/talent/ability matters, and you should have each member be varied in what they're expertised in so that you have someone for every situation. Perception lets you spot secrets/traps/switches, and is even needed for discovering things in the main story to continue so it's not just a trivial stat that you can reload every time you step on a trap, Having a character with leadership grants a boost to your whole parties initiative, damage, precision and so forth. Having a loremaster lets you identify items, enemies, and objects... and so on.The crafting system is pretty nice too, generally if you think two items should combine they generally do. For example, a branch + nine inch nails would make a spiked club, though if things don't combine you may need a higher crafting level :P.There's absolutely NO hand holding, past a few tutorial popups which just tell you the basics, When you're initiating a quest, you're expected to read through and actually find this location without any help markers, no ignoring the story you must read some of the finer details. The things I've listed above are only what's on the surface, It's a very deep and detailed game, and compared to modern rpgs, a godsend. I wholly recommend this to anyone who is interested in classic rpgs, and even modern rpg fans (though the difficulty may be a bit much for a casual ;), there is an easy setting... I haven't tried it though, I hear it's much easier than default though.)			"

												Overall impression: A good classic style RPG with some new ideas to gameplay. Unfortunately alot of these ideas don't pan out. Note: I played this game solo and in my opinion the game really is best played as a co-op. Aesthetic: The graphics and music are nice even on the medium levels and it runs well. In terms of theme it is a classic kind of fantasy game set within an already established fictional world. So, yes expect dragons, orcs, undead, and all that to be present.Gameplay: The game is tactical and turn based in terms of combat but in a unique action point based system. Also there are no movement grids but moving in combat does cost action points and leaves you open to attacks of opportunity. The games first fault is its unrelenting difficulty even on normal. Now while on hard this game boasts some of the smartest enemy AI I have ever seen, the AI also has a distinct predilection for cheating. Also the game does a very poor job of directing you where to go next. Now in an open world game this would be expected, but this is not an open world game. The games biggest faults are its diplomacy system and its puzzle elements. The puzzle elements are frustrating and completely unnecessary and often involve finding tiny buttons that blend in with the enviroment. The diplomacy system however is the worst offender. It uses a ridiculous rock-paper-scissor system that makes you feel like it is meaningless to put points into upgrading your diplomatic abilities since the computer cheats at it. Plus you can attempt to skip it  by pressing an option button but makes it completely random whether you win or lose the argument. Now I know they put this in for the co-op to settle disputes between the players but in solo it is pointless and annoying and overall just bad game design.Story: The game's strong point is its humor which is very self aware, tongue in cheek, and even breaks the fourth wall a number of times. Its a game that knows its telling a generic fantasy story. That being said the story is very good and has some very dark themes to it. It also becomes serious in tone at the appropriate moments.			"

Wonderful environment which enriches the atmosphere, interesting concepts for characters, well developed crafting, very entertaining combat and many things that other games lost over the years.It gets 10 stars from me for the co-op multiplayer.My only complaint: sometimes the characters dialogues hits you with a wall of text describing the story. I love the stories, but I would have liked an option to ask about it, something like ""please tell me more"". Either then that I love the game.			"

												Divinity is a lot of fun. First, a disclaimer: I haven't played Baldur's Gate, the Ultima series, Planescape: Torment, nor have I finished any of the Fallout games. I am not an avid follower of classic RPGs. Upon hearing about Divinity's unique co-op setup, I was suddenly spurred to purchase the $70 digital collector's edition because I wanted to play it with a good friend. This was the first time in 4 years I bought a game at its release price, and I am glad to say that my decision proved bountiful. Divinity is a great game and the developers put a staggering amount of thought into it. It's been an absolute blast playing it co-op and coordinating to execute tactics and tweak builds. I have no regrets.			"

												Deeply recommended, and a blast to play with a friend.Follows much in the vein of very, dare I say, ""old school"" RPGs; albeit clearly modernized. Combat and non-combat is seamless, and switches very smoothly. Meanwhile, there's a huge skillset that at first may appear overwhelming, but that makes perfect sense and is easy to manage down the road. Writing is, in my subjective opinion, excellent, and I've found myself both intrigued by the overarching story and its side quests, all the while it keeps getting more than a few good chuckles out of me. The graphics are in line with what one can expect from an isometric game, in essence doing its job very well in terms of representation; spell effects and abilities however shine brighter, and can actually look (and feel) both impressive and impactful.Playing with a friend is simply amazing (experience may vary depending on your friend's disposition towards RPG's and/or personality), with a system that allows you to be many screens and instances appart if you'd so wish, while being able to almost instantaniously get back together for those occasions of intriguing conversations or the amazing combat system.Get this damn game, mentlegen.

												Hands down one of the best RPGs in a very long time. The best part: It doesn't take itself very seriously. It's filled with witty occurences and characters, even some of the enemies are hands down ridiculous, which gives the game so much character. The reactivity of the game, the physics of it all is probably one of the more impressive ones I've seen in gaming thus far, how different types of matter reacts with one another, especially how you can strategize that during the turn based combat system is really in my opinion quite mindblowing, and one of the first times I have enjoyed a turn based system of this kind. A definite, and HUGE bonus is that the game doesn't tell you what to do, and in many occurences you actually have to guess that something is actually a quest, even though you will never get a quest log or quest marker for it, you may still at the same time get experience points for completing them. That kind of intuition in a game is something I've long saught after, all the way back to the days of arcanum, baldur's gate and fallout, as gamers we have become bereft of good RPG gaming experiences for a long time now and I am so grateful for this game and how it really brings so much fresh and old material together into the game of the year thus far. It remains to be seen what Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity may achieve, but for the moment this is my favourite game in years, and definitely of this year.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is antithetical to modern computer roleplaying game design in the same way that Demons' Souls rejected modern action roleplaying design back in 2009. Only, whereas DeSouls rejected modern conceptions of difficulty curve, D:OS rejects the modern approach to world and story design. D:OS genuinely innovates and, frankly, should be played by everyone with a passing interest in roleplaying games.In almost all RPGs these days, you have a few choices on where to go and what to do, but each choice is something the developer specifically set out to allow the player to accomplish. Occasionally, you'll reach a point where the developer could not think of how to restrict the player from breaking the game's storyline, so the game simply stops you. That NPC isn't dead; he's unconscious. You can't levitate over that battlement; there's an invisible wall. You can't break down that wooden door; it's locked. You can't steal the key to the final boss; it hasn't spawned yet.In D:OS, these sorts of restrictions simply don't exist. From the very start of the game you are free to go anywhere and do basically anything you want. If a character says, ""Help me out with this quest and I'll give you this item I have in my house,"" you can do the quest and he'll give you the item. But you can also bargain with the character and buy the item off him, if you want. You can also burn down his front door with a fire spell and steal the item. You can murder him, take the key to his house, and steal the item. You can have your partner teleport you inside the character's house then back out, stealing the item.All of these approaches are valid and none of them break the game's storyline, even if you were supposed to meet an ""important NPC"" on the quest you never bothered to complete (because you bartered/murdered/teleported/burned your way to victory).D:OS places almost no artificial restrictions on player behavior and makes no distinction between simply exploring the world and ""completing quests"". For instance, early on in the game, you're given a means of teleportation in the form of a small pyramid you carry in your pocket. However, like everything else in the game, this pyramid is just an item. You can drop it. You can drop this plot-important piece of magical equipment anytime you want, anywhere you want, and the game won't stop you. Why? Because it's just an item. In D:OS you can (with enough strength, or a telekinesis spell) pick up, carry and throw every single free-standing item in the game. This includes things like book shelves, books, candles, barrels, rocks, scrolls, keys, sheep corpses, weapons, and armor.Is your partner standing on the other side of a chasm? Does he need a key you found to open that chest? You can throw it to him. Did he find an awesome spear in the chest that you want to use? He can throw it back to you.Does that giant orc seem like too much to handle at your level? Lure him back to the city guards. Or kite him. Or lure him into a pool of water and electrocute him with a lightning spell. Or teleport him into lava. Or throw a barrel of oil at his feet and blow it up with a fireball.Does your friend want to explore west of the city, but you want to explore to the east? Split up. Go wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you want and do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want. All the time.Oh yeah, and the entire game is designed around cooperative multiplayer, so you get to do all of this crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥with your friends, too.Divinity: Original Sin is both a superb introduction to ""classically-styled"" computer roleplaying games and a genuine modern classic in its own right. It has excellent graphics, a charming, unpretentious setting, as well as some genuinely funny quest design and writing. This is one of the best games of the decade and certainly one of the best games of 2014. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Do not miss it.			"

												I feel the game's release was rushed so yes the game isn't perfectly polished. Having said that, if you're looking for an immersive RPG experience, one where you truly feel like you're on an adventure, this is the game for you. As a turn based/strategy rpg fan the combat of this game is satisfying. It is like a turn based version of Dragon age original meets magicka. However the game is so much more than just combat. If you're going to play this game I strongly suggest that don't rely on the internet (unless if it's for crafting.) Put yourself in the shoes of these 2 source hunters and try to discover everything on your own and guaranteed you'll have a blast. There isn't a specific way to solve a quest or beat the game, yes some of your actions and choices you've made might not be perfect and you might end up in a difficult situation but such is life. So all in all, amazing game. Not a polished diamond but diamond nontheless. Strongly recommended. (The devs are amazing too they really listen to feedbacks and I have no doubt over the next few months the game will only get een better.)			"

Early Access Review
								This game has the potential to be really good.  However, people expecting anything resembling a complete game at this point are warned against buying it.  The developers make it very clear in numerous places that this is still an alpha (not a beta) and crashes happen quite a bit along with broken quests, sound glitches and interface kludges (the inventory system sucks for managing between party members, and trading with vendors is even worse).  That said, I'm very optimistic about the final version.  It's frustrating but fun to play right now, and if they take their time it promises to seriously deliver.  Finally, I'll give a big nod to the music--it's some of the catchiest and best that I've heard come out of a game in a very long time.			"

Indeed it doesn’t seem that long ago since I was flying around as a dragon with a jet pack, wooing undead princesses and trying to take over the world. This time however we return to Rivellon in a more traditional sense in the form of a top down isometric RPG. Traditional not being a bad thing mind you, as Larian have taken every old school mechanic which they have then spruced up with some modern day flavour and some Larian magic to boot.Graphically Original Sin is a treat, the graphical fidelity of the game is both beautiful and stable. Everything from spell effects to the detail on rock faces is great to look at. One complaint I do have is the character models, I certainly think they could have been done to a higher standard. That being said of course one thing that did stand out was the character animations especially during combat. Spell animations  in-particular are a favourite of mine, its rare to find a RPG with spell animations that look and feel authentic. When you cast a bolt of lighting it really does look, sound and feel like your character is harnessing the power of the lighting through their body and unleashing out onto an unfortunate foe.Speaking of things sounding right both sound effects and the musical score hit the mark. The games soundtrack in-particular is a fantastic listen, something that the divinity series has become known for over the years and original sin once again brings forth a great orchestral score. While we are on the subject of sound something that was a huge disappointment for me was that the games dialogue is not fully voiced. Certain portions of the game are voiced and for the most part are done to a listen-able standard but I certainly feel that it was a big misstep for the title.Lets move on to what is in my opinion not only the foundation of the game but also its shining feature, the combat. Over the years I have grown very weary of the traditional way of designing isometric RPG's, that being they all have real time Diablo style combat. Point and click combat has become very repetitive and it's something I feel now hinders the genre more than it helps. Thankfully thanks the the re-emergence of games like X-Com, tactical turn based combat is back in a major way and the turn based combat in Original Sin is nothing short of brilliant. Movement, attacking, spells and other actions all require action points to preform in combat. Your character gains a certain amount of AP at the start of each turn depending on their individual stats, You can also save unused action points for the next turn. Combat is very tactical and a huge number of factors come into play including enemy type, strengths, weaknesses, distance, timing and more. On top of this you don't have to have all your party will you at the same time so if you spot an enemy cohort you can actually engage in combat with half of you party and then sneak the other half around the back, there by flanking the enemy thus getting not only the drop on them but also combat bonuses too.By far the crown jewel of combat is the environmental factors and the ability turn the tide of a battle just by manipulating the battlefield. Everything can be used and combined for example shoot a arrow and burst open an oil barrel, then use a fire spell to set the landscape on fire. Not only does the environment help you win battles but in tougher fights it becomes essential to use everything from poison gas clouds to lighting charged pools of water. One thing I personally like about the environmental aspect of combat is that the enemy AI will use things against you. Setting traps can backfire, you can be caught off-guard by a stray lighting bolt while your entire party is standing in water. Not only does the environment help both you and your enemies but because of the way the mechanic is designed, things can escalate to utter chaos destroying both you and your enemy.Finally I want to talk about the games story. Larian have always been good storytellers and Original  Sin is no different. The quality of the writing is good and there is plenty of quest content to do throughout the game. One thing Larian is renowned for is their sense of humour when it comes to their games and writing. Original Sin is packed with quips, references and jolly good humour. Even if it doesn't have your side's splitting, it will give you a laugh at least a few times.Overall Larian have produced a real gem with Original Sin and a fitting addition to the Divinity franchise. While I would have liked better character models, more voice acting and some changes here and there, it has to be said that whether your an avid RPG player or not, Divinity Original Sin is a game not only worth owning but worth playing.

												Deeply recommended, and a blast to play with a friend.Follows much in the vein of very, dare I say, ""old school"" RPGs; albeit clearly modernized. Combat and non-combat is seamless, and switches very smoothly. Meanwhile, there's a huge skillset that at first may appear overwhelming, but that makes perfect sense and is easy to manage down the road. Writing is, in my subjective opinion, excellent, and I've found myself both intrigued by the overarching story and its side quests, all the while it keeps getting more than a few good chuckles out of me. The graphics are in line with what one can expect from an isometric game, in essence doing its job very well in terms of representation; spell effects and abilities however shine brighter, and can actually look (and feel) both impressive and impactful.Playing with a friend is simply amazing (experience may vary depending on your friend's disposition towards RPG's and/or personality), with a system that allows you to be many screens and instances appart if you'd so wish, while being able to almost instantaniously get back together for those occasions of intriguing conversations or the amazing combat system.Get this damn game, mentlegen.

												Divinity is a lot of fun. First, a disclaimer: I haven't played Baldur's Gate, the Ultima series, Planescape: Torment, nor have I finished any of the Fallout games. I am not an avid follower of classic RPGs. Upon hearing about Divinity's unique co-op setup, I was suddenly spurred to purchase the $70 digital collector's edition because I wanted to play it with a good friend. This was the first time in 4 years I bought a game at its release price, and I am glad to say that my decision proved bountiful. Divinity is a great game and the developers put a staggering amount of thought into it. It's been an absolute blast playing it co-op and coordinating to execute tactics and tweak builds. I have no regrets.			"

It asked us to throw it into the ocean, but we disagreed on if that was the rightcourse of action.After an arguement that consisted entirely of ocean and clam puns, we played Rock Paper Scissors to resolve the debate.10/10 GOTYAY - IGNspot			"

												Hands down one of the best RPGs in a very long time. The best part: It doesn't take itself very seriously. It's filled with witty occurences and characters, even some of the enemies are hands down ridiculous, which gives the game so much character. The reactivity of the game, the physics of it all is probably one of the more impressive ones I've seen in gaming thus far, how different types of matter reacts with one another, especially how you can strategize that during the turn based combat system is really in my opinion quite mindblowing, and one of the first times I have enjoyed a turn based system of this kind. A definite, and HUGE bonus is that the game doesn't tell you what to do, and in many occurences you actually have to guess that something is actually a quest, even though you will never get a quest log or quest marker for it, you may still at the same time get experience points for completing them. That kind of intuition in a game is something I've long saught after, all the way back to the days of arcanum, baldur's gate and fallout, as gamers we have become bereft of good RPG gaming experiences for a long time now and I am so grateful for this game and how it really brings so much fresh and old material together into the game of the year thus far. It remains to be seen what Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity may achieve, but for the moment this is my favourite game in years, and definitely of this year.			"

												This game is overall great.  Took me a moment to wrap my head around the concept that even though an area is accessible the enemies aren't necessarily beatable yet.  I had to recreate my characters 3 times to get what I felt like was a decent composition, but that was part of the fun since there's so much to choose from.  Of course part of the problem is you're setting a large amount of customization before you even see waht the world has to offer.Sort of like Turn-based Diablo meets Dark Souls meets Baldur's Gate meets Dungeon Siege.Lots of inventory management, lots of different things to customize, lots of challenging battles, lots of interesting combat situations.For instance, if there is poison on the ground you can blow it up with fire, and you can then put oil on the fire to make a black smoke archers cannot see through.  You can make it rain and then chill someone in order to have a chance to freeze them.  You can use the rainwater to strengthen your electricity spells instead, etc etc etc.Worth a shot if you're into the genre.  If you're a super casual player, I'm not sure if I can recommend or not.

								It's a really fun and addicting game. There are a few bugs, as with any early access game. I for one am stuck with one NPC in my party that i can't talk to due to a bug. Its very unrelenting. Even on easy, this game punishes you for playing it. But once you start getting to level 5 and beyond, the game gets easier. All in all, it's a good game and worth the cash.

												Divinity: Original Sin is antithetical to modern computer roleplaying game design in the same way that Demons' Souls rejected modern action roleplaying design back in 2009. Only, whereas DeSouls rejected modern conceptions of difficulty curve, D:OS rejects the modern approach to world and story design. D:OS genuinely innovates and, frankly, should be played by everyone with a passing interest in roleplaying games.In almost all RPGs these days, you have a few choices on where to go and what to do, but each choice is something the developer specifically set out to allow the player to accomplish. Occasionally, you'll reach a point where the developer could not think of how to restrict the player from breaking the game's storyline, so the game simply stops you. That NPC isn't dead; he's unconscious. You can't levitate over that battlement; there's an invisible wall. You can't break down that wooden door; it's locked. You can't steal the key to the final boss; it hasn't spawned yet.In D:OS, these sorts of restrictions simply don't exist. From the very start of the game you are free to go anywhere and do basically anything you want. If a character says, ""Help me out with this quest and I'll give you this item I have in my house,"" you can do the quest and he'll give you the item. But you can also bargain with the character and buy the item off him, if you want. You can also burn down his front door with a fire spell and steal the item. You can murder him, take the key to his house, and steal the item. You can have your partner teleport you inside the character's house then back out, stealing the item.All of these approaches are valid and none of them break the game's storyline, even if you were supposed to meet an ""important NPC"" on the quest you never bothered to complete (because you bartered/murdered/teleported/burned your way to victory).D:OS places almost no artificial restrictions on player behavior and makes no distinction between simply exploring the world and ""completing quests"". For instance, early on in the game, you're given a means of teleportation in the form of a small pyramid you carry in your pocket. However, like everything else in the game, this pyramid is just an item. You can drop it. You can drop this plot-important piece of magical equipment anytime you want, anywhere you want, and the game won't stop you. Why? Because it's just an item. In D:OS you can (with enough strength, or a telekinesis spell) pick up, carry and throw every single free-standing item in the game. This includes things like book shelves, books, candles, barrels, rocks, scrolls, keys, sheep corpses, weapons, and armor.Is your partner standing on the other side of a chasm? Does he need a key you found to open that chest? You can throw it to him. Did he find an awesome spear in the chest that you want to use? He can throw it back to you.Does that giant orc seem like too much to handle at your level? Lure him back to the city guards. Or kite him. Or lure him into a pool of water and electrocute him with a lightning spell. Or teleport him into lava. Or throw a barrel of oil at his feet and blow it up with a fireball.Does your friend want to explore west of the city, but you want to explore to the east? Split up. Go wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you want and do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want. All the time.Oh yeah, and the entire game is designed around cooperative multiplayer, so you get to do all of this crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥with your friends, too.Divinity: Original Sin is both a superb introduction to ""classically-styled"" computer roleplaying games and a genuine modern classic in its own right. It has excellent graphics, a charming, unpretentious setting, as well as some genuinely funny quest design and writing. This is one of the best games of the decade and certainly one of the best games of 2014. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Do not miss it.			"

												To put it shortly, Divinity: Original Sin has proved what all of us who experienced Baldur's Gate knew already: CRPGs are still damn good games, and the design style hasn't aged much. This game, much like Icewind Dale before it, also proves that CRPGs don't need engaging stories to be good games. And I am not even slighting the story of the game; it seems rather cliche, but I haven't progressed that far in the main plot. I am actually omitting any opinion of the game's story from this review, because this game stands on its gameplay alone, much like Quake, or Dota 2. Icewind Dale was a similar example, and the primary reason it is so engaging without needing to care about narrative elements is good encounter design. If you have a series of encounters that are varied and present options to the observant often, the result is a really fun tactical combat experience with progressing characters. The mechanics surrounding the chemistry and physics of the game's various elements and spells often produce unexpected and highly amusing results, including burning zombies that explode every time you hit them; zombies bleed ooze (poison liquid), which is flammable, and burning creatures instantly react with any liquids they stand in. Creating a smoke screen out of either vaporizing water or burning oil is also very useful if you want to force your opponents to come closer and waste time moving around. The spells will be familiar to those who have played D&D tie-in games, yet they are modified in theme to fit with the game's magic system, and many of them will interact with the environment much more dynamically.The game's environmental effects engine is robust, and a sure sign of an intelligent decision early on in Divinity: Original Sin's design: it was designed to be a computer RPG from the ground up. Which is to say, the effects of all of the elements and physics in the game's environment would be impossible or at least incredibly infeasible to reproduce in a tabletop gaming environment. This means that the game was not designed with the same restrictions that applied to D&D's rules, which make up the framework of CRPG staples like Baldur's Gate, and even derivative mechanical systems like the one found in Planescape: Torment. Careful examination of almost all of the game's fine details show a structured traditional RPG rule system designed to be processed by software from the ground up, not calculated by hand on a tabletop. I don't know about you, but I personally greatly appreciate this. They could have been lazy and copy-pasted d20 rules into their game, but they didn't and it shows they care about pushing the envelope and not only reviving interest in the CRPG genre, but also innovating in it.I can't say that much about balance and scaling, because I haven't gotten to the late game yet. However, it seems like at the very beginning, melee isn't too strong. Similarly to D&D, once key buff effects are available on-demand in your party (Haste, just like D&D again), your melee fighters become dramatically more threatening. Rogues seem to be effective using either a melee or a ranged strategy; backstabbing is brutally effective as long as you don't draw aggro, but a crossbow's ""slow but powerful"" characteristics make it ideal for a single killing shot from stealth. Having at least one ranged specialist in your party is a good idea. Strategically-placed barrels can very often be put to use against the enemy giving you the advantage at the beginning of the fight. Traps and specific enemies (zombies, explodoskeletons) can also be shot with normal or special arrows to cause them to backfire with devastating effect on the enemy. I do dare say that having a wide array of elemental magic available is far better than specializing in one school of it. Experienced players will be able to combo all of their various spells' side effects on the environment to devastating effect. Pyrokinetics and geomancy along with hydrosophism and aerotheurgy are the obvious combinations (ooze and oil are flammable, water and wetness conducts lightning), but there are other useful combinations of effects hidden away for you to discover. Witchcraft is the odd man out, offering spells that inflict physical effects like Bloodletting, and direct status effect spells like Blind. It is also unique for bearing the Ressurect spell and a powerful spell that shields an ally from all types of elemental damage.All that aside, I do want to mention the quest design. When I said I wouldn't talk about the story, I was referring to the main plot of the game; other RPG quests are almost always completely unrelated and often completely independent in quality from the main quest. The quests are quite good for the most part, although those of us who are rusty to RPG quests that actually make you think might struggle a little at first. Divinity does not start off shy in this department, and throws you into an almost entirely pacifist quest tree to solve the murder of Councillor Jake of the town of Cyseal. Solutions in these quests will often necessitate alternate solutions when one is locked out, such as after a lost argument in the game's somewhat frustratingly chance-based disagreement resolution system. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed rock paper scissors, but you can hit spacebar to skip it. I'm not sure if it flips a coin for this result; preferably, a die roll based on the opposing characters' Charisma score or something, but I do not know. Even more fleshed out than the quests is the game's exploration factor. The game has so many strange encounters as the player travels through the game world that one might even begin to think they were procedurally generated somehow. Of course, the game encourages you to discover these places and encounters, throwing XP at you just for finding some place new.That sums up my gameplay review of Divinity: Original Sin. I do believe that this game has ushered in a revival of the CRPG genre.			"

								Normally I am not one for top-down RPG games however I can honestly say that this is one of the best games that I have ever played. So good in fact, that I have found myself sneaking playtime after work. By far my favorite part of this game is the turn-based combat. I feel that with this style one actually gets to experience the powers and abilities as well as apply them in a strategic manner. This comes in handy especially when taking advantage of environmental effects that can really change the course of a battle. The graphics are very well done and the game looks great for being a beta. The next great thing is the conversations. I love being able to play two different personalities and still advance both. I remember playing NWN and if you had a druid in your party you could not even kill a cow without damaging its alignment much to the anger of druish friends. Every decision you make actually feels like it effects everything else and I love that rush. If you have an RPG itch you need to scratch then this is the title for you. The only issue with the game is that the multiplayer is a bit of a miss with friends only able to play your characters. A simple abilitiy to host a game so each person can play as themself would have been a great idea. However, this fault in no way hurts the true awesomeness of this game.			"

								It's not often I write a review for a game, but after a brief stint I am already willing to simply say YOU NEED THIS GAME. Normally these type of games don't appeal to me but it has everything I want. Exploration, branching choices, choices that have effects, quirky characters, customisation, intuitive and most importantly excellent combat, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I am in love. Even in early access, I am very impressed. Kudos to Larian for this game, I seriously cannot recommend enough. If you like RPGs, fun combat and a damn good game, buy this. Goes to show, triple a titles like Diablo and Mass Effect can learn a great deal from small groups like this. Story telling and great combat. Like seriously, why are you reading this and not playing it.			"

								I know people have mix feelings with Early Access games, but Divinity: Original Sin is one of the better ones that have had consistent updates, developers listening to feedback from players and making changes/improvements to the game. The jump from Alpha to Beta is pretty damn noticeable and I'm not just talking about the graphics but the core elements of the game itself that have made it even better than it already was thanks due to the feedback from players and developers listening to them. Bugs/glitches have also been fixed. If you have any feedback you like to say after playing the beta do please visit the forums, more than likely they will respond and take note of your feedback.As for the game itself, it's a very ambitious game. A RPG that is Open World with optional On-Line Co-Op and it's Turn Based. When you think about it, there haven't been any WRPG's that have all of that, Shadowrun Returns, X-Com, South Park, Might and Magic X, and Child of Light aren't Open World and are also linear. Most people would turn away after hearing it's Turn Based but it's for the best for this sort of game. If it was action based it would turn into another Diablo clone and there's plenty of them out there already. The combat in Divinity: Original Sin is very deep that let's you play all sorts of styles with your character made Avatars. Weather will also play an element to the combat as it will affect the battles.The game itself doesn't take itself too seriously it can be lighthearted at times but most importantly it has fun with it's missions/side quest. No need to worry of fetch quest in this, Larian the Developer of this game have said they would avoid doing that sort of quests.  :)One other interesting thing to note. The game will come with a RPG Editor that made this game, it will be avaliable around the game release. You'll be able to make mods for this game and put it up to Steamworks. Divinity: Original Sin will be very Mod friendly. Will be interesting to see what type of mods this game will have down the road. Anyways do yourself a favor, if your looking for a great lengthy Open World WRPG game to play, then this game is for you!Oh and one more thing to note, the music in the game is awesome!!!			"

												*** UPDATED AFTER FIRST PLAYTHROUGH ***To add some information to my original review from the beta:* Combat stays fun throughout the game. Absolutely 11/10!* World design is great as well, diversity throughout the game.* Storytelling is fantastic! You'll have to listen what NPCs are saying and think for yourself as there are no questmarkers and helpers.* Companions are all right, but thats a point where there is room for improvement. The developers said they'll add 2 more companions to the game, we'll see how they are.* Took me 80 hours to finish my first playthrough, and I've skipped a few quests and probably missed quite a few things. There is just a crazy amount of content in this game, and they still managed to make every questline interesting. Overall rating: 95/100There are only some minor things that could be a bit better, overall it's just a great executed game idea. 80 hours of pure entertainment, probably the best game I've played in the last 4 years and definitely the best game this year so far. Unconditional recommendation to buy. Period.*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale while it was still in beta (about 7 days until official release) and thought ""Ok, I'll just wait for the release and play it then. Well... maybe I'll just check out the first level, just so I can see if it's any good..."".Now, 2 days later, I've got over 20 hours of playtime and I've played as far as possible in the beta. Damn.Seriously, this game is great. Probably one of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam, and actually the first time I'm writing a review for something. And I haven't even tried the Co-Op or the Custom Mods! One of the big Pro's of this game is how much you can play with the environment. Rain, Oil, Fire... there is so much you can conjure to your advantage. You can even make ELECTRIC CLOUDS. How awesome is that?Buy this game if you like:+ Baldurs Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age, DnD or similar+ Freedom of action (seriously, you can do so much creative stuff)+ Deep, immersive fantasy games with an actually great and crazy story + Challenging turn-based fightsDon't buy this game if you like:- CoD, because you might be overwhelmed- Farmville, because I hate you			"

								This game, warms my heart. So many options and ways to do things, apparently only 1/4 of the game is actually playable at the moment yet I've spent 50+ hrs dabbling around in it. Its still early access so lots of things to fix and tweak. But the small bit I have experienced thus far makes me impatient to see it completed. It brings old RPGs back in a big way.  Lockpicking, traps, secrets, synergetic spells and abilities, I seriously can not wait to play this with a friend.			"

			Cosmic reviews Larian Studio's new kickstarter funded RPG Divinity Original Sin. Get the game here - http://store.steampowered.com/app/230230/ Twitter - http://twitter.com/Cosmicengine99 Facebook -...		

Once again we go back to Rivellon with all its intriguing secrets and equally wacky wonders. Indeed it doesn’t seem that long ago since I was flying around as a dragon with a jet pack, wooing undead princesses and trying to take over the world. This time however we return to Rivellon in a more traditional sense in the form of a top down isometric RPG. Traditional not being a bad thing mind you, as Larian have taken every old school mechanic which they have then spruced up with some modern day flavour and some Larian magic to boot.Graphically Original Sin is a treat, the graphical fidelity of the game is both beautiful and stable. Everything from spell effects to the detail on rock faces is great to look at. One complaint I do have is the character models, I certainly think they could have been done to a higher standard. That being said of course one thing that did stand out was the character animations especially during combat. Spell animations  in-particular are a favourite of mine, its rare to find a RPG with spell animations that look and feel authentic. When you cast a bolt of lighting it really does look, sound and feel like your character is harnessing the power of the lighting through their body and unleashing out onto an unfortunate foe.Speaking of things sounding right both sound effects and the musical score hit the mark. The games soundtrack in-particular is a fantastic listen, something that the divinity series has become known for over the years and original sin once again brings forth a great orchestral score. While we are on the subject of sound something that was a huge disappointment for me was that the games dialogue is not fully voiced. Certain portions of the game are voiced and for the most part are done to a listen-able standard but I certainly feel that it was a big misstep for the title.Lets move on to what is in my opinion not only the foundation of the game but also its shining feature, the combat. Over the years I have grown very weary of the traditional way of designing isometric RPG's, that being they all have real time Diablo style combat. Point and click combat has become very repetitive and it's something I feel now hinders the genre more than it helps. Thankfully thanks the the re-emergence of games like X-Com, tactical turn based combat is back in a major way and the turn based combat in Original Sin is nothing short of brilliant. Movement, attacking, spells and other actions all require action points to preform in combat. Your character gains a certain amount of AP at the start of each turn depending on their individual stats, You can also save unused action points for the next turn. Combat is very tactical and a huge number of factors come into play including enemy type, strengths, weaknesses, distance, timing and more. On top of this you don't have to have all your party will you at the same time so if you spot an enemy cohort you can actually engage in combat with half of you party and then sneak the other half around the back, there by flanking the enemy thus getting not only the drop on them but also combat bonuses too.By far the crown jewel of combat is the environmental factors and the ability turn the tide of a battle just by manipulating the battlefield. Everything can be used and combined for example shoot a arrow and burst open an oil barrel, then use a fire spell to set the landscape on fire. Not only does the environment help you win battles but in tougher fights it becomes essential to use everything from poison gas clouds to lighting charged pools of water. One thing I personally like about the environmental aspect of combat is that the enemy AI will use things against you. Setting traps can backfire, you can be caught off-guard by a stray lighting bolt while your entire party is standing in water. Not only does the environment help both you and your enemies but because of the way the mechanic is designed, things can escalate to utter chaos destroying both you and your enemy.Finally I want to talk about the games story. Larian have always been good storytellers and Original  Sin is no different. The quality of the writing is good and there is plenty of quest content to do throughout the game. One thing Larian is renowned for is their sense of humour when it comes to their games and writing. Original Sin is packed with quips, references and jolly good humour. Even if it doesn't have your side's splitting, it will give you a laugh at least a few times.Overall Larian have produced a real gem with Original Sin and a fitting addition to the Divinity franchise. While I would have liked better character models, more voice acting and some changes here and there, it has to be said that whether your an avid RPG player or not, Divinity Original Sin is a game not only worth owning but worth playing.

Im excited for the spring and its full release. I have never been a fan of turn based combat (save for table top games.) But, Larian does it right. Its creative and origional and completely immersive and engaging.			"

								This game has the potential to be really good.  However, people expecting anything resembling a complete game at this point are warned against buying it.  The developers make it very clear in numerous places that this is still an alpha (not a beta) and crashes happen quite a bit along with broken quests, sound glitches and interface kludges (the inventory system sucks for managing between party members, and trading with vendors is even worse).  That said, I'm very optimistic about the final version.  It's frustrating but fun to play right now, and if they take their time it promises to seriously deliver.  Finally, I'll give a big nod to the music--it's some of the catchiest and best that I've heard come out of a game in a very long time.			"

												If you are even remotely a RPG fan (especially Baldur's Gate / Torment) then you will most likely enjoy this game. This is what Dragon Age should have been, but never was.Divinity: Original Sin also has a few extra things, rarely seen in RPG games:Spells + science = fun + tacticsThrow down oil and burn it or make it rain and freeze the enemies or burn the water for a smoke screen. The possibilities are endless.Item interactionAlmost all items can be interacted with, which includes destroying them. Drop down a barrel of oil and have a fire work party. Or block the road for the enemies.Path findingWhen I move my characters from A to B and there is a dangerous zone in the middle (fire, poison, etc), the characters are smart enough to avoid those zones. Thank God they have half a brain. The ""down side"" is, so does the enemy.Role playIt's kinda silly when playing single player, but you can go into a discussing with yourself (well, the other character you control). It's still a nice touch and can be fun in co-op.Co-opIt works, 'nuff said.			"

												I feel the game's release was rushed so yes the game isn't perfectly polished. Having said that, if you're looking for an immersive RPG experience, one where you truly feel like you're on an adventure, this is the game for you. As a turn based/strategy rpg fan the combat of this game is satisfying. It is like a turn based version of Dragon age original meets magicka. However the game is so much more than just combat. If you're going to play this game I strongly suggest that don't rely on the internet (unless if it's for crafting.) Put yourself in the shoes of these 2 source hunters and try to discover everything on your own and guaranteed you'll have a blast. There isn't a specific way to solve a quest or beat the game, yes some of your actions and choices you've made might not be perfect and you might end up in a difficult situation but such is life. So all in all, amazing game. Not a polished diamond but diamond nontheless. Strongly recommended. (The devs are amazing too they really listen to feedbacks and I have no doubt over the next few months the game will only get een better.)			"

												I recommend buying D:OS (especially if it goes on sale), but that recommendation comes with some pretty large caveats. It is a fun game, but another reviewer said something I fully agree with: I enjoyed it less the longer I played it. As I played I went from thinking of the other party types I want to replay the game with to doubting I'll ever play through it again. It suffers from some really large design flaws. Read on for details.Positives firstD:OS's shining gem is its combat system. The turn-based combat is fun, even after dozens of hours of it. Combat encounters feel balanced (with a few notable exceptions) and it's very polished. This is good, because you're basically going to wade through and kill everything that gets in your way. Graphics and sound effects are wonderful and appropriate without taxing your GPU at all. The writing and humor is charming, though eventually gets a little tired.Super useful tipHere's one easy tip that would have improved my playthrough significantly: don't bother collecting everything. Like many RPGs you can take or steal everything that is not glued down. You'll find yourself tempted to distract a character so you can steal the ink pot off their desk. Don't. It's just not worth it. Most items in the game are useless (food especially), and you will be absolutely swimming in gold by mid-game just by selling the items you loot in combat. There are occasional things worth buying from vendors but they aren't expensive. I finished the game with almost 1 million gold laying around. It's an enormous waste of time to grab everything. However, just to laugh about it once, do steal a painting off the wall then immediately sell it back to the owner. *sigh* Realism...Now the big flawsThere are dozens of smaller issues I have, but these to me are the should-I-buy-this-game type problems.1. The game's first major issue is the opening hours. At the start, you are led to an optional tutorial dungeon and have one minor combat encounter. Then you enter the first main town where you will spend the next 5–10 hours running around talking to everyone to open up the storyline and gaining enough experience to leave the town and not get your butt kicked by the enemies just outside. This is a game with a lot of dialog, which is great, but it is a really poor design to not let a player test their combat mettle until they've invested 10+ hours. That's why you read so many reports of people abandoning their first party and starting over once they understand the game mechanics better. This happens in a lot of RPGs, but most will let you realize your errors within the first hour or so. Replaying 5 hours of dialog is not fun.2. You control a party of four characters which you can outfit from head to toe in gear. Unfortunately, loot in this game is horribly bland. Here are the possible magical mods you can get: + to <attribute> (str, dex, etc.) + to <calculated attribute> (initiative, HP, etc.) + to <ability> + resist to <element> + <element> damage chance to apply <status> (burning, poisoned, etc.) immunity to <status> ability to cast <spell> unbreakableThat's it. Even the unique weapons roll with only those options. There are no interesting or hard-to-find mods. At the end of the game (level ~20) I found myself still using some level 5 armor that rolled with + to main stats because I'd not found more interesting replacements.3. Crafting. Everything about crafting kinda sucks. The interface, or rather the complete lack thereof, is the main problem. There are many many crafting recipes in the game but you alone are responsible for remembering them. There is no in-game list of the recipes you know. Everything is just ""discoverable."" Which means you'll keep a wiki page bookmarked and go to it when you're trying to remember how to craft something. It's all drag-and-drop for an ""interface"": drag item A onto item B to make item C. And your crafting character better be the one holding the ingredients because it won't succeed if you're trying to manipulate items in another characters inventory.4. For all the trouble it is to craft, almost none of the things you can craft are worthwhile. All of the weapons and armor you can craft are non-magical. They have higher base armor or damage than items you find, but without any magical mods they will almost never be better than what you've found. Food is utterly useless, and potions eventually drop from enemies like rain. All I found useful from crafting were special arrows, spellbooks and equipment boosters (rubies, bowstrings, metal scraps, etc.).5. Inventory management is a disaster. Items that inexplicably don't stack (like bone dust, the most common crafting ingredient, which I ended the game with about 80 of). Quest items never disappear, even after they are no longer needed. And lots of them just have generic names like ""dusty parchment"" or ""note."" Want to repair that bow? Unequip and send it to your blacksmith, fix it, send it back to your archer and then re-equip (yes those last two are required separate steps, you cannot drag from one character's inventory to another character's equip slot). Using the inventory filtering tabs is absolutely essential.6. There are a handful of areas in the game where you're suddenly and without warning insta-killed by some gigantic blast of damage. There are tons of discoverable dig-up spots throughout the game. Some of them will just wipe your party when you do it. Even the game's first major boss will one-shot the first character to come into range. If your whole party engages him together, you will almost certainly wipe. You can hear the developers laughing when this happens, but this kind of BS is why save-scumming exists.I'm going to try to describe these last issues in the most generic terms possible to not spoil anything specific, but they speak to the very end of the game, so I've put the potentially sensitive stuff in spoiler tags.7. This is a game that gives you some choice. Many quests are skippable, or can be tackled in various order. However, there's a large misguidance in this. As you approach the end of the game, you enter a gauntlet area that is clearly the buildup to the last encounter. This is good game design to let the player know the end is close. However, after getting through this area I encountered a blocker that said ""sorry, you haven't completed enough of the game to go further yet."" No! No, no, no, no, NO!!! If a player is required to complete X to get past Y, you do not let them even get to Y until X is done. I had to turn around and spend a few hours tracking down the remaining ""optional"" tasks until I could proceed. All the while every character is spouting the trope of ""time is of the essence, hurry!"" This alone almost made me just stop playing, and really ruined the end of the game for me.8. If that weren't enough, the game's ending is awful from both a storyline and mechanics point of view. After investing so many hours, the ending was a slap in the face. When you defeat the final boss, lots of shiny loot is dropped and you get the biggest XP gain of the game. You are then automatically put into an unskippable dialog, which when finished plays the final cutscene and then dumps you to the main menu. You cannot loot the last boss, nor save the progress of defeating him. All you can do is reload your last save game and fight him again. This is the least graceful handling of a game ending I've ever seen. And the story wrap-up is basically ""you did the thing you were trying to do. The end.""Basically, my reaction after it all was just frustration, which compelled me to come write this review. It's a game worth playing, but really could use some major improvements.			"

												It's my first time playing a ""Classic Style""  RPG. The game itself is really good, there is lots of content that should keep you entertained.If i had any problem with this game it would be that it's kinda hard to get into,being that it's a ""classic style"" RPG.That being said, i hope to put more hours into the game,Here's what i like so far:- Divinity ir really fun when playing COOP, with friends. Communication can help quite a bit, and it helps overlook some of the differences in the game.- I really like how during quests, it really doesn't spoon feed you on what to do, you have to figure things out yourself by investigating and walking around. I really like this idea, and 99% of all modern games don't do this. You are pretty much told what to do.I recomend this game, because overall it's really good even though it may take time to get into for people like me.UPDATE**- I have learned to really like this game. After putting a couple of hours into it i've realized i'm playing a type of game i wouldn't play otherwise. I've wrapped my head around the combat system (which i've grown to like). Also the AUDIO in this game is FANTASTIC! Definately worth the buy			"

												I can go ahead and give you spoilers for this review and tell you right now that almost everything you are going to hear is that this game is absolutely fantastic. Divinity Original Sin is a game made by Larian Studios and was funded thanks to kickstarter. It is one of the first isometric (Camera angle) RPGs to come out this year (Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Enternity due out later) and it is a fantastic start to a return to the classic rpg. Divinity absolutely lives up to the history before it from the likes of Balder's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout and Icewind Dale. 	As mentioned before, Divinity Original Sin is an Isometric RPG that combines the action RPG elements of free roaming and turn based combat like that of D&D, Dungeon and Dragons. All stats have an impact on how you fight during combat. Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc. all are your character's major stats that can influence how powerful and accurate your attacks are or how tough or evasive your defense can be. There are 11 starting classes including battlemage, cleric, fighter, rogue and wizard but that isn't to say you can't put points into whichever stat you want without penalty. The starting classes are just a suggested set of skills, attributes and armor for each one and you can change it to accommodate how you want to play. Do you want an Archer that can also cast fire spells? Sure you can have that. Do you want a Rogue that can sneak behind an enemy and then freeze them with frost touch or perhaps hit them hard with a battleaxe? Absolutely. The class combinations are endless and that is the first of many specializations to how you want to play the game.	As stated, combat is turn based which rules initiative into a roll that allows for who starts when; some enemies will start first regardless of initiative because of story but we won't get into that. This means that you could, with a high enough initiative eliminate half the enemies before they even begin their turn. However the battles can be ruthless as the enemies, in most cases, are the same or higher level than you and can be just as deadly. Thus meaning you need to use strategy and just about all your spells/abilities at your disposal. For example, you are fighting some knights/warriors and an archer is up on the hill attacking you from above. Well a good way to get him down is to have your mage teleport him to your melee characters or perhaps throw your teleport cube (something special to divinity that I won't get to deep into) and teleport your party up there. There are many ways to deal with different enemies but this game requires you to use strategy a lot during your battles.	Divinity absolutely does not hand hold whatsoever. Besides the starting tutorial dungeon that is completely optional, there is no instructions on how to play or what to do. In order to figure out quests you need to read your journal logs and dialogue among npc's and try to discern what to do next. Sometimes it is pretty obvious sometimes it is entirely difficult. On top of that you are not restricted to where you need to go. You can do quests way out of your level or you can save quests for later and come back and obliterate enemies once you are a higher level. There is no restriction on what you can do which makes it a ton of fun to figure out where you need to go and what you need to do. I could praise some of the features of this game for pages but unfortunately I'll let you watch some of our gameplay footage that we have of us playing to see more. 	The game doesn't just stop at gameplay and call it a night. No the story is also fantastic and takes a lot of the elements of plot devices to progress the story for you to find out who your characters are and why the events of the world are happening. It starts with your two characters who are Source Hunters that are on a quest to find out why a chancellor was murdered and by who. Source Hunters are warriors that find people using Source, an ancient dark magic, and to eliminate them. As the game progresses you slowly discovered the origins of Source and that it wasn't always a Dark power. A guardian of the forest Astarte was convinced by her friend to distract the Guardians guarding the God Box and open it. Once she opened it she realized what she had done and let out the Void Dragon which desired to send the entire world to oblivion. Immediately she trapped the Void Dragon in another dimension and source became corrupt. Your characters are tasked with the job to find out who they once where and how to stop those who use Source for corruptible means. 	The whole world of Rivellon is a rich world with lots of content and character. Most NPCs have some sort of story or quest and there are books with lore everywhere in the world. Most side quests are a little silly but a lot of them are fresh and great quests to go on. Some in fact are very well hidden and you must have certain abilities to be able to come across these quests. For example, in the King Krab Inn in Cyseal, there is a cat. You must have the “pet pal” ability in order to talk to him however he confesses his love for another cat in the city but the other cat won't love him back because she fears he won't be able to have kittens with him or some such. Well eventually you find a jewel collar to give to him and the female cat because infatuated with him. After you complete the quest even your characters mention how shallow the female cat was just because the male cat got a nice collar. 	Divinity is a very beautiful game with great visuals and a very aesthetically pleasing world. Each area is unique from the plains and beaches of Cyseal, to the forests and mines of Lucalla to the swamps and dungeons of Phantom Forest. Each area is unique and has plenty of items all over. Now it isn't the prettiest game out on the market however it is the best looking RPG to date. The music and sound is pretty well done as well. The music, though sometimes repetitive, is pretty catchy and I found no complaints with the voice actors themselves when they had their few lines throughout the game. My only complaint was during a small part in the market of Cyseal the NPCs would repeat their same lines over and over again every minute and could get pretty annoying. However that is a very small complaint on an amazing game.	I don't typically talk about re-playability, just usually give a score on it, however I would feel remiss in not mentioning it. Divinity has what I feel is an almost infinite re-playability. Along with the campaign that already has multiple paths during play and multiple classes and skills you can choose from; the devs over at Larian also included a powerful RPG editor that allows anyone to make their own campaign and submit it to the steam workshop for others to play. This allows for anyone that has an idea for a story to submit it to world to be able to play. On top of that there are also full mod tools that allow people to make mods such as a higher difficulty mod, 4 player co-op mod and the ability to add other items, skills and worlds to this already great game.	Overall this game is fantastic and is definitely one to remember for years. From the gameplay that returns to the classics, to great visuals, story and re-playability it is a game that is a must have if you are a gamer that loves story driven games with great gameplay.Story – 100Gameplay – 95Graphics – 90Sound – 85Fun – 100Replay Value - 100			"

												The turn based combat mechanics and insane amount of items, spells, crafting combinations and finally just exploring kept me going for 100+ hours but I honestly never ended the main story because I simply got bored with it. It's the single and at the same time greatest weakness of this game. Two main characters speaking with each other and getting different stats from dialogue choices is a brilliant idea but dialogues lack a sense of importance. It is just like they wanted to keep them fun and witty at all times and the story was just an afterthought. Companions are also a bit dull.Larian did a great job with this game and as a kickstarter backer I'm satisfied with it, I just wish the story was on Ego Draconis level. I still recommend it simply for one of the best gameplay out there.			"

												After 113 hours of play, I finally finished this game. That means a lot - I usually tire of most games after at most 20 hours, even if they are engaging and interesting. I enjoyed every minute of Divinity: Original Sin.The story is grand but not contorted (I'm looking at you, Final Fantasy XIII), so you actually care about what happens next. The characters have personality, and you are responsible for shaping those personalities as a player during dialogues. The battle tactics are great, something you otherwise never see in the RPG genre. The item specs are meaningfully deeper than just DPS, so choosing gear is actually interesting and deserving of thought. The world is large and open - parts where you're not meant to be are usually closed to you solely by virtue of difficulty, not by invisible walls or other plot mechanisms. Most goals can be achieved by several different means, ranging from the typical choices of combat, sneaking or persuation, to more exotic solutions like obtaining unreachable keys using telekinesis or teleporting around obstacles using magic. The only negative I can think of is the music, which could have been better.In summary, this is the best game I've played recently, and is among the very best games I've ever played.			"

												64 hours in and haven't beaten the game yet. 64 hours, everyone of them in pure bliss. The game brings me back to the days of Baldurs Gate when quests made you use your intellect and solve riddles or puzzles. The quest are enjoyable and the class system has been much improved since early access. There is a literring of pop culture references and fun characters to meet from exploring the world. There are some minor gripes with mechanics that can cause some frustration but I eventually got used to them and can easily work around them. The crafting system is great and trying out new things has rewarded me with interesting weapons/armor. I have been playing everything in multiplayer with a friend and the conversations have created many funny situations where playing rock paper scissors has changed the outcome of our quests. Eventually I will play through as a purely single-player experience and I'm looking forward to a different experience.			"

												I really, really enjoyed this game. I love the environment art and the world look in general. Plenty of quests and there is a lot of story to it. I did more reading the first time through and at times sure it seemed like a lot, but I was glad I did. If I had paid a little more attention I may have done a little better my first playthrough.I really liked the open world feel that rolls pretty smoothly into turn based combat. All the different ways to win fights is incredible. If you master the elements, use choke points, crowd control, summon elementals, and use shields effectively you can win almost any battle. Early on I found myself picking off an enemy, retreating,, and then rinse and repeat. It's a nice option if you aren't that great. Battles are winnable without retreating but sometimes you really have to be crafty to pull them out without retreating.The ranger is an incredibly fun class. Mage was good too. Melee was about as good as melee can get. The cool part about this game is you can make hybrid characters. If you are diligent in getting as much xp as possible you can have your main skill and a secondary one at a medium to high level. I highly recommend a second playthough to try out classes you didn't get to. There was a ton of stuff I never tried in my first run.If you don't have any patience this game isn't for you. If you have OCD this game IS for you, but you must be OCD with patience :D My second play through I was able to grab my brother in law to co op with me. Since I knew the story and basically where to go and how to progress I'm able to keep it moving along for him. We are playing through on hard. It's actually easier to me than normal. You have to really work together and care about your buddies character as much as yourself. In our run I got even better at using the elements and my brother picked up at a decent pace so we work pretty good together. Progress is slow because he gets tired easy on the slower moving games. but he keeps coming back for more!For the achievement guys, this game is pretty cool too. Use a guide(seriously no shame in it) because steam only lists like 10 of the 80ish achievements. In short go through it as a good guy the 1st run. Then you can be more nefarious and evil the 2nd time through. I'm just about to 100 percent on this game. It's been a good ride.Crafting is fairly extensive, that's great! Blacksmithing makes you good money but a little lacking in depth, useful but not super interesting. Also recommend a crafting guide. The way you combine stuff isn't my favorite but it gets the job done.Overall a full, rich, and in my opinion bug free. I only had 1 bug my whole play through and that was my character having no limbs or head after being resurrected. Just a floating torso LOL! That was pretty funny though. Hope this helps you if you are on the edge about it.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is an enchanting walk down memory lane for me, with a camera position that reminds me of Diablo, and elements of Dungeons & Dragons behind every choice. I'm heavily reminded of Baldur’s Gate with this series, and that is not a bad thing in any way. The gameplay is turn-based, and I feel the combat couldn't have worked any other way. The nervous tingle you feel when you are so close to your next target but are short on action points is second to none for me. The rogue class in particular was exhilarating for me, stealing all the paintings in town and pickpocketing guards with reckless abandon. Exiting the starting town with over 17,000 gold in pocket and every revive scroll is a wonderful feeling.I feel as though there is a synergy between all the classes, and some classes don't work as well with others. Running a Ranger with a Fire Mage, for example, is quite hard when the Fire Mage puts up clouds of smoke you can't see through. You could also play with an Ice Wizard who “accidentally” stuns you. And there are a fair share of game breaking bugs that I encountered within the first hour of gameplay. Such as breaking down a gate while on the other side, and getting trapped because the game registered the gate as still closed even though it was in splinters below my feet.Basically, you need to play this game. Even if you have to play it by yourself because your friends are jerks, you still need to experience this game in some form. It's incredible.			"

								Recommended.I have personally enjoyed completing all of the available game content. I think the turn based content is great especially when you start learning who to fully utilise your characters skills. I chose a ranger for the main character and initial sneak attacks can really thin out enemies. I like that your party can be also affected by their own spells such as slipping over on ice. The combat should get even better with additional development and feedback.I only experienced 2 crashes in my 16 hours of play (I have only played the build 1.0.147). I didn't noticably lose any inventory item or progress.There are possilbly some minor broken quest paths but my experience could be due to some of my initial choices blocking off certain pathways. The main issue that I had was more of an annoyance in that I couldn't teleport my whole party through Waypoint Shrines but had to use them 1 party member at a time.I would personally play this game with some bugs than a lot of the garbage RPGs that big developers have released over the last several years. I personally don't care about the lack of voice acting as half the time I skip it and just read the dialogue anyway.If you're willing to put up with some bugs and only a small portion of the whole game at the moments Divinity Original Sin is highly recommended. Otherwise wait for the final release and support developers who are making games with real gameplay not just pretty graphics and dumbed down gameplay. "

For the Italian version scroll downDivinity Original Sin, a Kickstarter gemSadly I missed the crowdfunding of this project, I would have took part happily!Divinity is an old-fashion RPG that uses turn based combat sistem, isometric view, character creation with stats and skill and a huge load of dialogues (just think that the translation patch weight 1,4 gigabytes).You take the role of not one but TWO heroes, the two Source Hunters sent to Cyseal to investigate on the death of Councellor Jack where it looks like the Scourge, a tainted magic, is involved.Already this first choice is interesting, two heroes, you can play solo and decided their personality or even better you can play co-op with another user and you can take part to double dialogues options with another human!The game mechanics are pretty simple, outside the combat sequences you have to explore, search and talk with the people, charisma challenges and sneaking will help you if you specialize in those. Talking will eventually reward you with ""attitude traits"" that will give your character a boost (even bad traits). The combat is a turn-based combat system that uses the well know Action Points mode, you will have some AP based on your stats and moving or doing actions consume them, you can end your turn when you have depleted them or decided to save them for next turn. Then another character turn begins. There is a level system and each level grants your character a stat, skill or talent.The world is split in 3 maps (plus a minimap that serves as ""base"" for you but I won't spoiler), they are huge and full of quest but on the other side they are ""only"" three, this makes the game looks almost short even if it took me around 90 hours to complete it.Item selection is huge as well with the classic rarity based system and the spell selection is not bad either.All this is packed in a catching storyline with funny parts and a lot of references.Divinity Original Sin is a must have!Pro:- Perfect for co-op but solo play is awesome as well- Great story and huge load of quests- Nice crafting system- A good selection of difficulty levels makes it fit for every userCons:- Class are not really balanced, enchanters are really strong at first but combat class are way better later- Despite the big load of quest and gaming hours just 3 maps makes the game feel short- The camera is quite annoying, especially when a single left click does all the actions, you may misclick-----------------------------------Sfortunatamente non ho partecipato alla raccolta fondi per questo progetto, l'avrei fatto volentieri.Divinity è un gioco che strizza l'occhio a vecchi GDR con combattimento a turni, visuale isometrica, personaggi personalizzabili con stat e skill e un casino di dialoghi (la patch italiana pesa da sola 1,4 giga)Non avrai il controllo di uno ma ben DUE eroi, i due Cacciatori della Sorgente che sono stati mandati a Cyseal per investigare sulla morte del consiglire Jack ucciso in maniera misteriosa, probabilmente tramite l'utilizzo della Sorgente stessa, una magia corrotta.Già questa scelta è interessante, l'uso di due personaggi che potranno essere giocati in singolo scegliendo le loro personalità o, ancora meglio, affrontando i dialoghi ""doppi"" in cooperativa con un altro giocatore.Le meccaniche di gioco sono abbastanza semplici, fuori dal combattimento dovrete esplorare, cercare oggetti e interagire con i personaggi, prove di carisma e di furtività vi saranno d'aiuto se siete specializzati. I dialoghi vi daranno eventualmente dei tratti di personalità che andranno a dare benefici ulteriori ai personaggi (anche quelli negativi). Il combattimento è strutturato a turni con il noto sistema dei Punti Azione, avrete degli AP in base alle vostre statistiche e muoversi o fare azioni li consumerà, potrete decidere di usarli tutti e chiudere il vostro turno o finirlo in anticipo per salvare PA per il prossimo. Quindi il turno di un altro personaggio inizierà. C'è un sistema a livello che vi premierà con statistiche, abilità o talenti ad ogni passaggio.Il mondo è diviso in 3 mappe (più una piccola che vi servirà come base ma non vi spoilero come), sono grandi e piene zeppe di quest ma d'altra parte solo ""solo"" 3, questo da una sensazione di giocare ad un gioco piccolo anche se ci ho messo circa 90 ore a finirlo.La selezione di oggetti è vastissima con il classico sistema di rarità e la selezione delle spell non è malaccio.Tutto questo è impacchettato con una storia intrigante, momenti umoristici e molti riferimenti.Divinity Original Sin è un must!Pro:- Perfetto per il co-op ma anche in solitario non è niente male- Bella storia circondata da miriadi di quest- Crafting system niente male- Livelli di difficoltà molto vari che rendono l'esperienza di gioco adatta a tuttiCons:- Le classi non sono ben bilanciate, gli incantatori sono forti all'inizio ma soccombono alle classi non magiche poi- Nonostante il gran numero di quest il fatto che ci siano solo tre mappe da la sensazione di piccolo- La telecamera è odiosa e con il fatto che il click sinistro fa tutto può causare innumerevoli sbagli			"

												The first RPG in a long time (count the first Witcher in) that made me feel excited in my stomach. 50 hours of gameplay in a medieval-inspired, fantasy setting, with things to loot, combat and also side quests, but also weather that I actually believe to be real (in terms of the game, of couse).The story becomes personal despite what it may seem like at the beginning. You can craft, mine, digg, explore dungeons and wast living cities. The combat is challenging at times, but rewarding too, and the game is nonlinear enough so that you can be only as moral as you please.			"

												Divinity is pretty fun. Has a much slower pace than Diablo III because of the turn-based combat. The story and lore of the game is surprisingly good. Conversations are not all VO which is a negative for me, I prefer not to feel like I'm reading a novel when I'm gaming, but some don't mind that aspect. This is an 'old school' RPG through and through. This is one of those games where you will get the most enjoyment if played with a friend.			"

								When I purchased the game I wasnt able to play very well (Alpha was not yet optimized for my lower end computer) but with beta, my god it is just.. larian studios have out done themselves even my computer now runs the game wonderfully. Divinity Original sin is beautifully designed, the use of scrolls/spells to navigate the puzzles and hazards adds lots of depth to your character and how he/she explores the world. Larian studios will give you the most enjoyable and difficult dungeon exploring, evil boss slaying, puzzley puzzles and loot hunting you could possibley handle. Larians exploration in turn-based combat has been unparalleled, the seemless transition from free roaming to turn based combat lets the player think carefully during each fight.At 40 dollars, it is an absolute bargain in my opinion, anyone who considers themselves a fan of RPGs MUST own this game, you will not regret it.**Edit - Save often =.=			"

												""Storytelling"" and ""Strategic Screw Ups"" This game emphasizes romhack hard mixed with painful decision making, its best to play this game Co-op with up to 1-3 other friends.

WATCH WHO YAH TARGETIN"">Limited Voice Actor Failure.

Adds the Isometric quality of Sacred 2 and Diablo 2, and converts and updates the combat into 'turn based' like Baldurs Gate II.  Mixing all of these peices together.  And you have a total AMAZING fan service to fans.  If you are on the fence about this title but have played an enjoyed any of the above games I mentioned.  Than you owe it to yourself to pick up this game.			"

												Hmm what to say. All reviews i read are VERY good online but im not sure i can agree.Graphic wise the game is very nice, looks very solid and beautifull.But to be honest, the game is boring to me. most of the quests are just walls and walls of text.I get the feeling if i dont take the time to read trough it all i dont get a connection to the characters at all, which i dont because i dont read all of the text/quests completely because its to slow/boring/uninteresting.gameplay wise its ok, but jezus do you really have to make the fights 4vs10 even levels around the first few hours. you will die over and over and over if you dont run back to the guards etc. To much random stuff going on in the fights.Most of the quest also make you do weird things in order to progress like shoot at a painting to break it so it shows a hidden lever in a random house. no reference to the painting or the level anywhere in the quest history to doing that.Selling and buying is a HUUGE pain in the♥♥♥♥♥also.for me its a 6/10 but i only level 7 on the mains and no desire to move on / level on.

												This is going to be one of those weird reviews because I recommend this game while I condemn it at the same time.  Currently I have 465 hours clocked and to state that I dislike a game while having put so many hours in it requires some kind of an explanation. Just bare with me.But first a scene.At the foot of a rockface lies the body of a man. Next to the man we find a note. In this note he states that he has been given the gift of flight by a statue and is about to jump off a cliff to experience the thrill of freedom that comes with flying.You read this note.You look at the body.You look up at the rockface.You think,'That is a bad joke, or perhaps a note left to hide a murder. In a bad way.'What do you find out?It is no joke or a ploy to hide a murder. It is exactly what happened.If you can't figure out why this is a badly written scene, than please visit the neares bookshop or bookwebsite and get yourself say a Sherlock Holmes book or perhaps some good fantasy novel. And if you are not into books, get Torment to compare this to.Original sin is written by juveniles with juveniles in mind. Actually I am overstating this and apologize to the juveniles. This game just has♥♥♥♥♥♥poor lazy writing. It is a cavalcade of bad dialog, trite stories, embarrasingly bad humor and unispired quests. I imagine grown men in a computer filled cellar giggling at each other when they got the brainwave to change sorcers to sourceres. How decidely funny that was. And so brilliant. No really?So what about those 465 hours?And here we have the part that I recommend. You see I play this co-op and try to ignore the badly written awful stuff. Sometimes  even my companion gets irked at me and says something like, 'Yes it is bad, just ignore it.' He is right of course.Of the 465 hours he probably put in 400 or something. For he is a meticously guy. He is opening those boxes and reloading until he hits the jackpot and finds a legendary bow or armor with the proper statistics. Amazingly patient.  I wouldn't have the patience for it.As a single player I wouldn't recommend it all and I am certain it will never get in anyone's top 10 list of greatest roleplay games ever and might even get in the top 10 worst written roleplay games ever.Even as a co-op it doesn't shine, but given the lack of fantasy role play co-op games it is passable. No doubt we will be buying the sequel for co-op fantasy games remain a rarity, however badly written. And given the track record of Divinity francise it probably is.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is an abstract treatise by Larian Studios on the Christian concept of Original Sin (the game title is a dead give away, folks). It offers a subtle but powerful commentary on the metaphysical implications of Original Sin, the Soul and Free Will. It sheds light on the subject matter in a manner that would make St. Augustine proud.Ultimately, Larian comes to the conclusion that Eve was pretty good at rock, paper, scissors.			"

												I remember the time that me and my friend came across these two sick and dying patients in a doctor's house. The nurse there had a healing stone, but it had only enough charge to cure one of the patients.The other would die.We realised this was no light choice. We had these two people lives in our hands, and one of them was about to slip away.We spent the next few minutes gathering information about both of these people. Anything that might help us decide.The answer became clearer.I figured we should save the man with a family, who is well loved and respected around the town. I was, in fact, surprised to learn that my friend felt differently. He though that we should save the young travelling merchant because he ""liked the way he looked"".How arbitrary.It seemed we weren't going to reach an agreement. It seems we would have to agree to disagree and then leave it up to the flip of a coin to see who to save.But my friend wasn't content with that.He drew his bow and walked right up to the older man's bed and threatened to shoot unless we did things his way.I knew he wasn't bluffing.Unwilling to compromise for the sake of a merchant without a family who risked his life every time he left the town gates, I knocked my friend to the ground, thereby eliminating the immediate threat he posed.I had only a few moments to convince him to do this the fair way... But I failed.We both knew I had superior equipment, and so I hoped that would deter my friend from attacking me. The problem was that he would do anything to get his way most times, and I knew this.And so we fought.""Don't make me do this!""""I'm not.""""If you keep trying to kill that man, I'll have no choice!""""Just let him die! He's useless!""""Stop it! I don't want to have to waste another resurrection scroll on you, but if you die I'll be the only one to make the call!""""You wouldn't do that!""""And why not? Besides, your guy still has a chance to live! As big a chance as my guy!""""Ok! Ok... You have a point. We'll do it the ""fair"" way.""Relief! I had convinced him. It was a lucky thing, too. He was on the ground, about to die.We played a game of scissors paper rock. Honestly... I cheated. We were in the same room and I waited to hear the sound effect that indicated which option he chose. He didn't notice and I didn't tell him until the ordeal was over.And so the well-known, loved and respected man was the one who was healed. I could tell my friend was annoyed but his clutching his hair and saying ""No!""And that was that.Except it wasn't.I couldn't believe what I was seeing... The man was just about to walk out of the house when my friend shot him! He didn't die immediately, but I knew I couldn't stop him this time. Even if I killed him, I'd just be wasting a resurrection scroll... My friend wouldn't stop until the other man was dead.And so I said ""Fine!""I drew my dagger and went to the side of the other man's bed. I thrust the dagger down once, twice, and it was over. There was blood all over the floor, and all over the bed. We looked at each other. ""You monster..."" I said.And then we burst out into laughter.Tragicomedy/10			"

												First of all, I don't think that this game is complete crap and even I had some fun playing it for the first few dozen hours. My problem is, that many reviewers seem to nearly worship it as a masterpiece, while it is very very far away from that! Some people even compare it to the all-time-classics like Baldur's Gate, which is imho an insult for these games.I don't want to go into detail about the gameplay here, because others have done this often enough. To make it short: despite some major and minor flaws, the old-school-gameplay as well as the turn-based combat is the reason why people love D:OS. I understand that, because I like this part too.D:OS's main problem is, that it lacks everything else a good RPG should have! If you are looking for an epic story, interesting characters and well-written dialogues - in my opinion, things, that are elemental for a true masterpiece in that genre - you are totally wrong here!What you get instead is a pure freakshow, where you aid the lovesickness of animals, solve dissensions with 'rock, paper, scissors', sneak around disguised as a huge rock or tree, speak with people that are talking nothing but stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥ fight against walking snowmen and fire-spitting mechanical chicken and so on and so forth. After 40+ hours I just couldn't stand this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t anymore.To sum it up: you won't find something serious to happen here. If old-school-gameplay is all for you, you may like this game. But if you are looking for some substance in terms of world, lore, story, characters and dialogues, stay far away from D:OS!			"

												Only played a few hours, but I am really enjoying this. Its new with graphics and art, but its old in the way it doesn't hold your hand. You have to go slow, explore the town, talk to everyone to find quests or clues. Going in the wrong direction will kill you quickly.The game mechanics are great in that they let you play with them. You can create your own combos mixing elements for interesting results. Make a rain storm and freeze an armored warrior for a few turns, then shock an archer with lightening (extra damage cause of being wet) and then he gets stunned for a turn!			"

												Baulder's Gate mixed in with turn based rpg fun. There is a ""surface"" system, where the ground can be covered in various substances (oil, water, blood, fire, poison etc.) and they each react to different elements. So cast a spell to place oil around your enemies then light it up with a fireball for massive damage. Classless, chose and build your characters however you want. Co-Op is available through steam (steam integration ftw!), LAN or direct connect.The game starts off rather badly paced, but picks up greatly. One of the best games I've played in a while.			"

												I almost cried tears of happines as a gamer after some time with this game ;) Been playing crpg from early 90's late 80's, Ishar, Ultima, Baldur's , Nwn, Torment, Gothic, Elder Scrolls, M&M , Arkania, Anvil, Eye of the Beholder, Lands of Lore, Arcanum, Darklands, Bard's Tale,Betrayal at Krondor and many more others for all this years and Your game is a FIRST game of GOLDEN DAWN of classical cRPGs and best cRPGs ever.Upcoming year (2014/2015) we will have Witcher 3, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2 , Dragon Age 3, Numenora.But you are the FIRST, First game in no less than 10 ,maybe 15 years which brings life to crpg again (not to mention wonderfully moded Skyrim) . You gave us hope that real crpgs are still alive and can be great success even if aimed at more demanding gamers.Your game is PERFECT (and when im thinking of editor it will contain , it will be all time classic for sure) CRPG.It is like a dream for any crpg gamer who loves Ultima series, Gothics, ES, Might&Magic, full of attention to smallest details, breathtaking world, great story, awesome audio-video ( GOD , Your soundtrack could compete with masterpiece from Kai Rosenkratz from G3 or previous, it is at same level like Jeremy Soule compositions too), genius mechanic, great UI,really good crafting (just wow ), loads of humour, really interactive world (putt off fire with water, put old vase on pressure plate, gigantic maps full of content, weather, electrify enemies who stands on water tile with shock arrow, move things with telecinetic spells, search for treasures with shovel, make traps,cook, possibilites are numerous) and no level scaling , great story full of twists, loads of texts, options to choose, rich dialogue lines, no magic compass, and NO MORE self resolving quests for monkeys with one-two line of dialogue! Divinity 2 was already good crpg, but with Divinity : Original Sin you made your way to halls of eternal fame in hearts of all tru crpgs out here.With this title Larian enters Sacred Grounds and takes seat between, Bioware, Black Isle, Interplay, Troika , Beth, 3DO, Piranha, Dynamic, Origin, SSI, Microprose, DreamForge or NWC .And wonderfull idea of Co-Op ! It takes breath away, it is like our own session in Ultima , but no, Your game is LOT better than Ultima! I hope you will make this game , just start of beloved series!Now time to sink again in your game , while wife sleeps ;)THANK YOU , THANK YOU, THANK YOU ! ! ! PS.After almost 3 days after i wrote above post im even more happy with this game, it is incredibly deep and so much full of content that your head can hurt ;).Absolutely amazing game, worth of every money.

												It's a fantastic game, and if you've played e.g Divine Divinity you know what to expect. A fantastical RPG game which doesn't take itself very seriously.It has all the necessary trappings, character development, quests, magic, monsters and lots of mayhem. Like the previous games it also has a lot of things you are free to break, and lots of ways to do it. A guard bothering you? Teleport him out of the way. A big baddie too tough? Bring him back to town and let the guards take care of him.As for new things, the way you develop your characters is well done and a new take on the old formula, but it works rather well. The magic system is ingenious and fun to play around with. The dual characters and the role playing happening between them is a welcome break from the rest of the game.All that needs to be said though is buy it! Buy it and make your friends buy it so you can teleport them into lava and laugh at their misfortune.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is a throwback to what Action RPGs used to be.  When I was a young adult back in the late 90s early 2000s we had games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, and Nox.  These games, while real-time based (technically based on DND rules), flowed well and the envrionment was at your disposal.  Divinity should not be compared to any of these games as the gameplay itself may be similar but some of the major elements are still missing.  Divinity is a turn based action RPG based in the Divinity world.  You don't need any former knowledge of the series but you will see some appearances and references to other games.  The world is, in my opinion, a medium sized world that captures your attention and makes it feel much larger due to several factors.  First, everything is usable or can be modified from one state to another.  Some of this comes into play during combat.  In fact, some battles that could not normally be won until a later level can be won earlier if you play your battle correctly.  Oil barrels that explode upon getting hit by a fireball, poison barrels that lay poison onto the ground which can be ignited by fire, and water that can be electrically charged, stunning everything in its area.  These are all aspects of a battle that can be turned against you or the enemy, don't forget, blood conducts electric too, so that blood puddle isn't something you want to stand in if a mage is slamming bolts everywhere!The one thing that really intrigues me as well as adds points to the game is the difficulty.  This game, as said before, is a throwback to the old school games of the early part of last decade.  There are no quest markers or hand holding.  You need to figure things out for yourself and this could be a turn off to the new generation of gamers.  Please don't take this as an insult but most newer games step you through the entire game, Divinity does no such thing.  The map is useful for markers that you can place, town areas of interest, secret boxes marked on your map, and waypoints.  With no handholding you are left to fend for yourself, this often entails you wandering for a few minutes until you get your bearings.  Walls of text that can get in the way and have no meaning to the current quest line can get annoying but are there to help you immerse yourself.  Quests can often go either way, kill the troll or let him live.  Sometimes you find friends in the strangest areas, so before you go blasting into combat make sure that the skeleton you get your eyes on isn't a friendly.That brings me to the combat which is extremely well designed.  Everything is turn based meaning that each character goes and does what he/she does for their turn and then it is the next characters turn, friend or foe.  Action points make up your characters ability set and define how many things they can do in a given turn.  Walking, attacking, casting most spells, and drinking potions all consume action points.  The good news is, if you want, you can save up your action points to a certain amount and unload three, four, or even five attacks in one turn.  This adds an element to the combat that makes it strategic.  Some spells cost so much that you need to wait one turn to even cast them while other spells have a cooldown regardless of how many action points you have stored up.  As you level your characters you quickly learn how to lose professionally.  Enemies two levels above you can completely pulverize your party unless you got a trick up your sleeve.  However, the level difference begins to get a little easier as you get more powerful.  Character creation is somewhat of a detailed job that you can easily spend an hour getting right.  The classes presented to you are merely templates as you can modify them to be anything.  Want a geomancer with pyromancing abilities? Go for it.  Want a mage that can wear heavy armor and cast spells?  Sure, go for it.  You do end up sacrificing some things over others as going the latter route will undoubtly have you suffering in one aspect or the other eventually but it is still a viable jack of all trades class.  I am a personal fan of the Red Mage play style so when I can get a party to have a red mage I do it.  On a final note on character creation, you have to create two as the story line does entail two protagonists, so your other two party members will be whomever you choose as you go throughout the game.As far as the graphics go, the game is good enough.  Nothing stellar but it was never designed in that fashion.  The music rocks and the voice overs are nice.  The game can run on high end systems with no issues and even on middle and low end systems fluidly.Now with every review comes a few of the bad things.  First I would like to point out that you need to read the manual.  This isn't a flaw or a bad thing for me but again, the newer generation wants everything done for them as games are designed in this fashion.  Another flaw is that sometimes you intend to attack an enemy via melee but your character moves around them instead.  I have had this happen a few times and it gets irritating to say the least.  I haven't lost a battle because of this but it drags out some battles an extra turn when it could have been over earlier.  My other complain is the walls of text I referred to earlier.  Sometimes you end up reading a page out of a book from one conversation before the point is made.  While this adds depth, doing this to often gets tiresome, especially when you are eager to go out and whoop some butt.  Overall, Divinity: Original Sin does the old days justice.  It captures what made games so good back then and then amplifies it to another level.  I was really hoping for an open world in which I could go anywhere and do anything.  While you can do as you wish, some areas are just way to powerful for you and you get spanked.  The story has a set path that you will be at certain points at certain levels, give or take one or two.  I don't think this is bad but enemies don't respawn so other than retracing steps to get some older quest complete or a secret dug up, there is little reason to go back to old areas of the map already explored.Points Breakdown:Combat and Controls:9/10* The moving instead of attacking bug/glitch gets annoying so I took a point away here.Graphics:7/10* Nothing Stellar but still good none the less.Sound:9/10*Fantastic Sound track and decent voice acting.Difficulty:9/10*Set it to easy, normal, or hard.  No hand holding!Story:9/10*Well designed from the start.  You begin not knowing much other than that you are a source hunter. "

												I'm a true tactical turn-based combat fan since the first Fallout(s), Jagged Alliance(s) and XCOM(s). It's hard to find (good) A-games in this specific genre for the last decade, with XCOM: Enemy Unknown (2012) as an exception. Then out of nowhere came Divinity: Original Sin and after the first few rounds of combat I just couldn't stop smiling... Shamefully I admit that I blatantly ignored Divinity: Original Sin for quite some time, as I suspected/confused it to be more of a hack-and-slash RPG - boy, was I wrong. Even as a fan of the earlier mentioned genre, I'm blown away by the combat gameplay Divinity provides. Each round of combat feels like a small chess game with an opponent who always has an advantage. However, thanks to the massive amount of spells there are plenty of possibilities and combinations to fight yourself to a victory that truly feels well earned, as a few misses or a wrong decision often lead to certain death.'Thanks' to the different enemies you can't rely on the same strategies at all: were you ripping your enemies apart with a combination of poison and fire a few minutes earlier, now you are struggling with mobs who are completely resistant to both elements (or could even heal them). So while specialization is demanded, you need to have enough variation too. Also the environment provides plenty of (dis)advantages; bottlenecks and corners, snowstorms and fiery seas of lava, barrels with oil and poison are a few examples that could either help or kill you.While combat is by far my favorite part of a game, I must mention the following pluses too:+ the storyline is epic + the interaction between the two main characters (and completely f***s with your game decisions in a fun way)+ side quests are surprisingly entertaining + a vast amount of humor (and references) + the massive crafting system (based on logic thinking and a few books that explain less logic combinations) (Lastly the co-op way is apparently really good, but I unfortunately couldn't give it a go yet)Divinity: Original Sin is without a doubt one of the best games I played this year and I bet (and hope) it will set a standard for many games to come.

												(SPOILERS AHEAD)Great classic RPG, but I don't really think it's a masterpiece. Apart from the great fighting system and the freedom of choice, the game has some problems. First of all: the random puzzle solving (which is based mostly on your character perception) slows down the pace of the game and it could have been done better. The other thing I did not like was that you only have two NPC's to join your party, sure Madora and Jahan are pretty powerful, but I would have expected some other recruitable characters during the game. One thing that annoyed me was the final part of the game: to get to the last area, you have to collect Star Stones, which in case you missed you will have to go back to previous visited areas in order to get them. This is a bit random and it kinda stopped me at the end... I know it is a classic RPG where you have to use your wits, but do you really have to stop the player like that and send him back in a sort of Scavenger Hunt? Last thing: FINAL BOSS is incredibly unbalanced. You get to him at level 20 (which I think it's the level cap) and it still is impossible. I mean, you really have to be extremely good to beat him, but that is not fair. I went through all the fights like butter, then you get to this big black dragon and he is overpowered, plus he can summon annoying enemies that can stun you and knock you down,  and on top of that you have to protect an NPC (Astarte) because if she dies it's game over. C'mon... Probably it's just me who suck at this kind of strategic games, so even If I've found this problems, I still feel to recommend this game. It is a great and enjoyable classic RPG, with some flaws that prevent it to be considered a masterpiece. Nice work Larian! Keep it up!			"

												I really wanted to write some bad things about this game because i was feeling a bit let down at first but then more i played more i realized how good this game really is. It is so perfectly implemented that i couldn't find anything bad to say. This is a great game with great humour plus a slow & steady approach to gameplay. Totally a cRPG that you should buy*!Pros :+ Very good character skills. At start you will feel like drowning in the ocean of variety.+ Strong balance between wizard archetypes.+ Endless humour in every corner of the game!+ Totally grim-free.+ The official soundtrack makes you feel rested, relaxed without even a single, memorable, crescendo. You can use it while you're trying to sleep though your dreams may involve someone torturing you with various musical instruments and just before you crack and speak, you die from boredom. In fact this might be the reason why this game is so good, every cent they saved from music probably went to implement other stuff. Thank you Mr. Pokrovsky.+ Nothing like BG, BG2, IWD, IWD2, NWN or any other Black Isle or its successors' games, all the hype was just to make you expect less from it.+ Encourages people to install other cRPGs and play them.+ Even when one of your chararcters is in combat, the others can still travel and talk with other npcs, which kinda feels the battle is either slowmotion or stuck in time (which makes sense since main quest involves time).+ The characters move rather slowly for you to have plenty of time to appreciate the whole living game world, you'll fully realize how the time passes by so you can't miss any appointments or chores to do.+ You liked Magicka? You'll love this adaptation of it as cRPG both in utilization of humour and enviroment dynamics plus how wizards are the best.+ Very good enviroment interactions, first time in any cRPG or puzzlesolver and you'll practically  ab-use it in EVERY combat.+ Pays homage to other Divinity games!+ Funny character proportions especially an eye candy for WoW fans with very varied character appearance customization, you can even create the Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction with caucasian nose, with an in-game portrait of someone else you do not know who. Look at those big hands! Clearly str 18 wizards for the win.+ Very civil in-party dual conversations (with grand total of TWO options, either one of the chars says no and the other says yes or they can agree).+ Complex crafting with hidden recipes encourages the use of internet.+ Great sandbox experience, you can go anywhere, anytime, if you can run fast.+ In fact game is so non-linear (especially in Hard) , you will choose to play it as if it is linear.+ Endless replayability only limited by your thin patience.+ NPCs' lines are amazingly funny! How they came up with those jokes? They keep doing those hilarious jokes over and over and over again.+ Not even single conversation with any NPC that feels serious, you'll practically feel filled with joy all through the game.+ Very good immersion in main quest line where you always ask yourself ""am i trying to stop the end times or just stroll around most of the times?"" + Beyond cool main characters, whom both are source-hunters, hunting re-sources and sometimes even source-rers!+ Endless RP opportunities with no ties to the actual game world. Best if RP'd as sourcehunters, with their really not so coherent, occasionally RP wise non-fitting , lackeys.+ Closely stitched community, everyone wants the best for the game and everyone shares the idea of how GREAT this game literally, really, is. If you read a review says otherwise and NOT recommends this Masterpiece of cRPG, please downvote it even if it sounds true, so the writer can understand his/her wrongdoing and can change it to recommended. + You can't find more un-helpful negative reviews in any other game! Just check!+ Forget the GoTY this is the Game of the century!Here, more Pros :+ Cures Cancer.+ Passes democratic legislations.+ Shortens human pregnancy to 3 months.+ Ends racism.+ Feeds africa.+ Protects endangered species.+ Makes Pandas horny.+ Prevents WW3 everyday.+ Reverses global warming.+ Enhances the efficiency of non-fossil energy conversions.+ Keeps The Queen alive.+ Turns Pinocchio into a real boy with 5 fingers in each hand even though he had 4 as a wooden boy.Cons :+ Bit worse than Divinity : Original Sin Enhanced Edition.+ This game's lack of cons is a con itself.+ The Cake is a Lie.+ My english.+ If you liked this review, you will definitely love this game.*When it gets a huge discount.Thougth for the day : UK should abolish monarchy.

												A fun game for co-op adventures. A very nice take on turn based RPGing. Enjoyable both in and outside of combat.Unfortunately can not comment on how it would be solo, as I've only played with another friend so far.I can recommended this if you have a good friend to play it with :)			"

												This game is overall good but i found that the combat was the most enjoyable part and there was too much flavour text for the Quests.The setting is bad and that is being kind and it is only explained to you by dozens of pararaphs of flavour text.There are many bugs that allow easily to exploit functions such as the jail.To break out of jail get the follower Jahan and have him teleport a guard into the cell and fight him, then hit the flee button and it will teleport you out of jail.This is easily exploited and has no consequences whatsoever.The combat is fun however but is poorly scaled, i say this because you struggle to fight enemies one or two levels higher than you and this makes exploring a chore.The enemies that are your level seem easy unless in large numbers and in that case it is difficult to spread out damage and the screen soon gets crowded.You actions in quests feel like they have no effect whatsoever and its just a constant level grind to fight new an harder enemies.The combat however is very tactical as its difficulty makes it very easy to make mistakes and the way you need to imply strategy and use the enviroment to your advantage makes the combat feel different from that of other games and unique and this is the best part of the game for me.Although this review seems very negative I would still recommend the game to anyone who likes the RPG genre and enjoyed old RPGs like Baldurs gate, Ice Wind dale and Neverwinter as it is similar to these game in its style and combat system but with a whole new world to explore and modern day graphics.I hope this review has been helpful and will aid your decision in purchasing this game.

												Based off the first 16 hours, the game is completely delightful. Between the turn based (X-com style) combat, the huge amount of depth in crafting, the visual beauty of the game, the fun stealth/stealing ability, the humorous writing not being overdone in addition to the ability for certain classes with a particular skill to get more out of the world with talking to animals who might have clues for you. Another fun thing while you control the party, the two main characters can agree on things or not leading to the fun social minigame of seeing who is right bending the story in interesting ways. PS-starting off, I'd recommend the Witch & Wayfarer first as the summon is quite helpful, one has a heal & all that's left is to get a simple fire spell & rain spell which should help. Might have more info later on when I play more or start over but so far that's a winning combination.			"

												A pretty amazing achievement as far as RPGs go, and games in general. It definitely harkens back to the Ultima series and Baldur's Gate in terms of story, depth and interactivity. I like that it doesn't hold your hand, yet is still pretty accessible. The amount of interactivity is staggering. The graphics are gorgeous and rich, and the gameplay is a lot of fun. The combat is challenging - you will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked if you aren't carerful, but it is fun and very strategic. Being able to use certain elements to your advantage (lighting oil on fire underneath a monster or electrocuting them in water) adds another layer to your strategy. I've barely scratched the surface on this game, but I'm incredibly impressed and very happy I purchased it. It's a masterpiece, and will go down as one of the greatest computer RPGs ever made. It is in very good company.			"

												As a veteran player of RPG games, I first purchased Divinity: Original Sin with a 'Ho-Hum' attitude.Looked like the sort of game where I had been there, done that, got a closet full of those tee-shirts.Wow, was I wrong.First mistake I made was customizing my characters via character creation without understanding the game. Wasted a few hours playing them to finally realize that I had nerfed myself badly with characters that had no synergy, duplicate skills, or spells. This game will not hold your hand and will gleefully let you make all the assinine mistakes you wish.I have not been stuck in an rpg game for years. Most of the time you go in knowing what to expect; Divinity: Original Sin throws all of those ideals out the window. You can fry, electrocute, burn, poison, and otherwise main and kill your own party members, pick all the wrong skills, spells and talents, and etc.The combat at first was brutal and advancement was difficult. In each fight, one or more members of my party died and had to be ressurected, with each battle barely won by the skin of my teeth.Now for the good news. After you go to school, take your lumps and learn your lessons. You can start over again with a new party that is better and more thoughtfully created.Then you will find that those hard battles before are actually very winnable, using a synergy oriented party, better tactics, taking into account the terrain, the surronding elements and objects that you can use to your advantage.You learn to ask, ""Will blowing up that barrel of flammable liquid, be a better use of my spell that targeting that Orc?"", or ""Will moving this crate, or teleporting that object (or the enemy) change the dynamics of the battle?""Speaking of combat, you will do yourself no favors assuming the A.I. is going to act in a predictable manner. Even restarting a save after having your behind handed to you, and going back to try again doesn't mean the battle will act out like the previous battle did. The A.I. does a great job of using the enviroment as well, targetting the right people at the right time, acting in harmony, and otherwise being a down right pain in the unmentionable.Divinity: Original Sin also has some great moments that makes the game world feel real and connected. You may read a sign in one town, and then met someone in the wilderness who's story or actions connect to that obscure sign back in town. You may overhear a conversation in a tavern, and then find something in a dungeon or some remote spot, that makes you remember what you overheard.Additionally, Divinity: Original Sin supports Multi-Player. However that is a mixed bag and I have mixed feelings on it. For example, its a minor gripe that I can't make my own character, that is multi-player only and level it up through joining other peoples games.Also, not Larian's fault, but I have seldom joined a game that 'worked'. What I mean by worked is, they are either AFK, kick you as soon as you join (??), or I have had a time or two, where just because you didn't play as they would play the character, they would kick you (and I consider myself to be a decent player that uses forethought and tactics).In other words, if your doing Multi-player, stick with doing it with friends or otherwise don't expect much, because it's just not going to happen from 90% of the experiences I have had.Pros:Lots of humorous moments both in the game and in dialogue.Character banter and interaction that makes for great roleplaying.Challenging difficulty in battles that is actually refreshing and forces you to think.Character Creation that lets you customize to your hearts content.Sufficent Classes you can choose from, or custom create a hybrid of your own.Great and interesting Talents to choose from.Lots of content.Many Elements and Spells, to satisfy even the most demanding Casters.Reputation System that lets you be as good or as bad as you want to be.Be a hero, be an Assassin, or be a Harbinger of Doom to foe and citizen alike. Nothing is off limits or unkillable.Fast response on bug fixes, updates and patchesMod support (Nothing out there yet, but the game is very new)Multi-Player Support.Cons:Doesn't hold your hand anywhere at anytimeYou have to learn some of Divinity's obscure game mechanics on your own (odd but I consider that a plus also).Difficulty can be challenging and a player can waste hours building a party that just will not work.Occassional bug has been stumbled upon, so far nothing game stopping.The inventory management could be a tad better (such as limited sorting, stacking, etc).Multi-Player support (joining works, but no character of your own, so no feeling of investement, and no real motivation)Conclussion:I recommend Divinity: Original Sin whole-heartedly. If someone is new to RPGs, it may be a baptism by fire, but this could be the game that is one of the rare cross-overs, people will play even if they are not typically RPG inclined.If anyone is into RPGs, it will be in your gaming libary eventually, if it's not already.

												One of the most amazing rpg's I have played since Baldur's gate 2. In the beggining even though I saw its amazing 9.3 (original score cause this things gradually go a little up or down with time) user score in metacritic I was skeptical mostly due to the turn-based combat. Well I coulden't be more wrong, everything exceded my expectations especialy the combat aspect. It really flows well with this game as it adds an extra level of strategy and depth with the limitation of action points (much like a combat endurance simulator) and it makes things especialy convenient for multiplayer playthroughs that I plan on doing after my single player experience. (started a multiplayer game in the begining but wanted to take it at my own pace, read every dialogue and lift every rock for the first time).Everything works smooth and the enviroment details look fantastic captivating you at some stages of the game. The music is beautiful, worthy of the old rpg titles it has a relaxing sensation with the a melancholic tune at times and magical at others.The voices role play and sound as they are suposed to sound(old men,farmers,warriors etc good voice acting). The main characters voice talk to each other as you explore the world also throwing random humor whenever they can. The humor is one of the few in an rpg's that actually made me laugh at times.All in all its worth the 9.3 score that sets it above great titles especialy seeing the work that was put in making this game shine so I can safely say if you like more complex and rich rpg's like the great titles of old this is a must have and more than worth its price.

												I was sceptical at first but after playing the first two hours I was under the spell of this game.This game is round-based when a fight starts at that's not the only thing I like. The quests are great and even side quests need more than a few hours to completed. The diversity of quests and the plot behind is great.The graphics of the game could be a bit better but it is meant as an old-school RPG, so I'm fine with that.I played more than 100 hours until I finished the game. Fortunately, I found only one bug that prevented me to finish a quest. Apart from that the game is well designed and I had lot's of fun.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin has blown me away. The game style is artistic, creative, original (excuse the pun) and constructed in an incredibly smooth and interactive way. The interaction within the world and numerous classes allows for your imagination to run wild, even within battles. One skill can change the entire tide of battle, outnumbering the enemy with your own party and summons or 'charming' a powerful enemy onto your side. The turn base combat allows for strategy and team work, and the 180+ skills and countless enemies result in many unpredictable fights. I would definitely recommend this game, the non-linear story creates a sense of freedom that is perfect for exploration off the beaten path, and allows for you to play at your own pace.Play this game with a few friends and I assure you it will be ten times as fun.

												This game is a grand old time. The combat, while not totally innovative, is quite immersive due to the intriguing interactions between your attacks and the environment. You can face creatures head on, or use controlling tactics like covering the ground in burning oil or storm clouds. The story feels a bit scattered at times, but is overall quite enjoyable, and there are plenty of secrets, easter eggs, and jokes to keep you interested. I love the soundtrack, though I wish that it was a bit larger, there seem to be only a handful of (amazing) songs that play. I've not personally played the game multiplayer, but I imagine it would be very enjoyable, as it seems to be built for two players (you get two avatars and they can both be roleplayed seperately).At 40 dollars it's not a bargain, but I would say that this is worth it, especially if you can catch it on sale.

												If you like non-linear RPGs where you can do quests in any order, this is not your RPG. Every area has enemies levelled in a way that funnels you in specific ways. If you ignore these, you will find quests that can't be completed (because you never triggered the ""please find this item"" part and now that you already have it, you can't tell the quest giver about it), or non-sensical dialog: ""Who is X?"" (where X is a boss you have already spoken to, and killed), or ""Y is summoning undead? He must be stopped!"" (When you have already dealt with Y). Nothing game-breaking encountered yet - just a few quests stuck as 'unfinished' which also means less XP.Otherwise, the combat is fun - mixing elements or figuring out ways to dispose of enemies the best, and some of the puzzles are decent too. A decent old-school type RPG, but needs a little more work on the quest system.			"

Multiplayer is fun, and combat is brilliant.PS: This game is putting heavy emphasis on RP. No, seriously, it ♥♥♥♥♥ RP on your head until you ♥♥♥♥ing drown in it.

												The game starts you off on a beach away from the main town you will be starting in. You will hit combat pretty early and find that it is indeed turn based. Anything outside of combat however is in real time. Most skills can be used in and out of combat for various effects. Mastering these skills and when to use them will be critical for your success when exploring the world and fighting off the baddies. A common complaint is the difficulty of combat. The combat is hard at first. Since it is turnbased many people approach it like they would Final Fantasy Tactics. Rush your melee in close while sniping with ranged. While this MAY work in some cases here, it is best to understand your skills and use them in the best way possible. For example, running in with a melee character will allow him/her to take aggro nine times out of ten, but with overwhelming numbers, his HP will be hard to restore, even with health potions and spells. Crowd control will often times set this plan on the path for failure; knocked down units (Ally or Hostile) will automatically get hit 100% of the time. Meaning that tank of yours just got hit twice by every enemy on the map. Think about your moves:-What would happen if you backed up around this giant rock and let the melee come to you?-Is there any special barrels around to set off at the right moments?-What spells do I have? Should I skip my turn to combo them next turn?-My tank is in danger, should I teleport him out and inflict friendly fire damage?-There is just too many! Should I escape and try again later?If you can get past the difficulty of combat, I can guarentee that many RPG fans will enjoy this game. BUYER BEWARE: This game is kind of like The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind in regards to no quest marker. The developers have done a fantastic job in not holding your hand while playing. You have to think, read, remember, keep track of everything. You never know what you'll need to solve the various mysteries and quests. There are bugs, and the developers have already been working their butts off to patch them and make this game even better. The game supports Steam Workshop and the fourms are flooded with amazing ideas that I cannot wait to come to life to bring infinite replayability to the game.			"

												Good RPG for about 60-80 hours, especially since market lacks good team-based RPGs with turn, tactical combat. Humor and very well made world interaction are additional pros.Game suffer a bit from losing momentum after 2/3 and ""nerfing spree"" of devs - since small group of people on official forums constantly demands nerfs of various elements, skills, traits and mechanics (because they find game too easy, even on highest difficulty - I found it quite okay and fitting, nothing too hard and nothing ""clearing itself""), devs are mostly focused on that aspect, apparently forgetting about additional companions and other features they promised. I finished game before that happened, but if you would run into heavy reduced resistances or find something like ""glass cannon"" reducing hp by 80% instead of 50%, while giving +2 AP instead of 2x AP per turn, then you will know who to thank for that.But since I cleared the game withing ~75 hours and I dont regret playing, I dare to say that it is still good product. After all, games should be all about fun, right?			"

After spontaneously digging up some graves looking for loot, we stumbled upon a secret cavern. We entered the cavern with big round eyes searching for hidden treasure. The cavern was a large hallway which led to an open cavern with a flowing stream. Standing between us and the winding stream was a hunchback. I approached boldy and shouted my salutations. Within a few feet of the figure, he burst into flames. He then looked up at me, his skeletal grin and empty sockets mocking me. Surprised i stumbled backwards. My partner shouted something incoherent and cast teleportation on the skeleton freak. The freak appeared several yards away near the top of the cavern before falling unceremoniously back to the ground. By the time he hit the ground i was already invisible. I creeped over to him as he stood back up. I then noticed a large flaming mechanism in his hand. I ignored this and slipped behind him. I then slid my daggers into his fiery back with a shout of fury. The skeletons head twisted completely around and grinned at me. I let out a shriek as my daggers melted and fire spread up my arms. The fire spread to my torso before i felt the heat. I couldn't help myelf, i screamed bloody murder as i ran in the opposite direction of the stream. I made it nearly a dozen feet before i crumpled to the ground and groaned as i felt my penultimate sigh leave my body as a small puff of steam. My partner screamed in agony as she saw me die. In a manner of rage she charged forward and cast spells at the fiery figure. She took a step out into the clearing and her eyes widened as several skeleton hands forced themselves out of the earth. Soon followed by the bodies of the undead. She stood surrounded by these grinning figures as the fiery figure slowly stalked closer to her. In a rage unrivaled by heroes of old she swung daggers and slung spells untill all were bonepiles except for the fiery abomination. Still grinning, it lifted the mechanism and pointed it at her. A fiery stream protruded from it and she was momentarily engulfed, using her quick wit she throws herself to the ground and rolls. As she stands back up with scraps of burnt clothing remaining, she notices she dropped her pack. From it protrudes a scroll. ""The resurection scroll we knicked from the wizard!"" She leaps forward and grabs it, still lying on the ground as she recites the incantation. She is already on her feet by the time I am lifted off the ground by some invisible force. My burns diseappear and i land on my feet running toward the flaming skeleton. He aims his mechanism and i slide across the ground underneath him as the flames shoot above me. At the same time my partner is knocking a water arrow and shoots it. It strikes the skeleton in the face, water engulfing it. Steam rises as i do, and i plunge what is left of my daggers into its back. I twist the handles and pull out rapidly, the skeleton lets out a cry and explodes in an inferno. I am disintegrated instantly and my partner's skin melts from the extreme heat. As she slumps to her knees, she hears a faint sound from the stream. The water is gurgling, but it almost sounds like a laugh. She lands on her side and wonders if things would have been different if she had only married the fishmonger her mother was so keen on. Oh, why did she have to live a life of adventure? 11/10			"

												Excellent game but I'd value it at about $20,  replayability is limited and you cannot progress the game by using in game hints and problem solving skills,  You'll need to consult the web to progress some quest with impossibly hard to find buttons or random clicking sequences or hidden walls that don't light for interaction like every other object in the game.If this game has a mod that focused on the battles/character progression and loot aquisition i'd be inclined to play a lot more.

												Steep learning curve and has lots of hidden tricks and secrets you'll have to discover for yourself. Can get very frustrating, but once you get over the hump and learn the game it's a beautiful RPG. Co-op recommended.The dialogue doesn't get very deep. The combat is easily the best part of this game. Some parts are awful, such as the rock-paper-scissors system.			"

												This would have to be one of the best RPG's I have played in a long time. Plenty of custimization, co-op, openworld and everything else you could put in a RPG, It makes Final Fantasy and many others look like childs play. A Turn baseed explosion and I recommend this game to all RPG gamers around the world. Oustanding turnbase action that is completely smooth, and graphics that are simply stunning. Divinity has a great amount of classes to pick from ranging from warriors to mages, and will have you completely captivated from beginning to end.			"

												I have to tell, that this game delivers in all aspect. Close to a perfect gaming experience.You can customize the characters you start with in many different ways, absolutely deep combat system, takes time to learn what does what really. I only figured out some stuff around level 8-10, which it was too late, but never mind, I'm gonna play through this game in the future, that's for sure.The music is great, it really fits the game, tho after 60 hours of gameplay you'll find them not so great, even tho they are. Especially like the one playing in the main menu.The game finally is built on being more rewarding. No minimap locations are given for quests, you'll have to figure them out on your own, tho some of it proved to be somewhat more difficult, I personally used a wiki page for like 5-7 quests, how to solve them or what to do.The story is incredible, it really tries to be out of the ordinary, and it succeeds.The enemies numbers are a bit of a problem sometimes, but with the right tactics you can overcome them, and also finding the appropriate area to go sometimes results in wandering around for tens of minutes.Also this is probably the first game I did all the reading, not just skipping the texts and conversations. I mean ALL the reading. I've read everything put into the game.Towards the very end I found the lvl 19 monsters too powerful, but I think I should've done my heroes right from the beginning and I woulnd't have had this problem.The Hero-chain-system is somewhat annoying, having to break them and re-connect them all the time if you want them to start the battles where they actually are, not in formation. Also, healing back up all your characters gonna often take time, since they cannot start another spell until they finished with one, this is only a minor thing tho.I totally feel the scrolls are wasted, all those scrolls for nothing really, there weren't one time I decided I should use them instead of taking action with my heroes. Well, there was, but I could count them on one hand.Also I found that the timer on buffs are good for battles (3-5 turns per buff), but in real-time it lasts only 20 seconds, so you cannot really make anything of it, like pre-buffing your guys before battle, cuz the first summon will wither away by the time you finish putting the last eagle-eye on the archer. Btw archer. Why set apart bow and crossbow, when the staff and the maces, axes swords fall under the same 'two handed' category ? blah. Well. Great Game anyways. 8.5/10Highly Recommended "

												A bit like Baldurs Gate. However, you need to be aware that the game requires a lot of micromanaging for your group, since the UI doesn't do anything to help you guide your characters or find out where to go next. Also, there's an insane amount of traps all over the game, which is pretty annoying. If you can look past that, it's an ok game.			"

												As someone who is relatively new to turn-based RPGs, I was hesistant to play this game. The art style is incredible and completely suits the soundtrack accompaniment. Many NPCs unnecessarily have dialogue, especially market vendors, which began to infuriate me to the point that I wanted to throw my speakers at the person who bought me this game. I found the gameplay progressed a little too slowly for my liking and although it was good in some aspects that there was limited handholding, I would have appreciated a little bit of direction in the beginning. The turn-based combat was fun, albeit a little tough to get used to (but as I said I am new to this game style). I did find it annoying that the characters always took the most dangerous path during combat usually walking through fire or acid. The Co-Op idea is great in theory, not so great in initial practice. I was under the impression it was a drop in/out Co-Op and this is definitely not the case. If you were not the initial host but want to play some more of the game, too bad you get to start all over again, or wait to play with your friend again. Also, if you want to have a specific main character you better get the host to create it how you want otherwise you are stuck with whatever they create. Trying to get a Co-Op game going took me and my playmate over an hour to sort out. 7.5/10 - The Co-Op initial setup soured me on this game so much that my care factor about the story is severely limited. I will keep on playing it, but would be more inclined to replay Diablo 3 over this at this stage.			"

												TL;DR: Fantastic, as long as you don't mind the slow progression pace.Divinity: Original Sin has become one of my new favorites. Starting with the simple, it's a turn-based ""tactical"" RPG. You can control up to a party of 4, and you cycle through your characters in an order based on their (and their enemies') initiative stat. In combat, you fire off spells and hack away at enemies in this turn-based fashion. It may sound dull to some, but every choice counts in a battle, especially if you are facing a boss or a group that is a higher level than you are. If you play any other RPG. you would probably not think twice about taking on a level 6 enemy when you're level 5, it would just take a bit longer, right? In DIvinity, although it is possible with the right strategy, taking on a group that is one level higher than yours can result in your enemies to steamroll over your group. It can be quite hard, especially before you get a hang of the combat system.The combat is very satisfying; it looks good, sounds good, and your characters deal a significant amount of damage whenever you get an attack off. The difficulty doesn't come from the enemies being arrow-sponges, it comes from your own mistakes. While shooting a fire arrow into a oil surface sounds great at first, you soon realize that your archers and mages cannot see through the smoke, forcing you to wait for the black clouds to disperse. I've personally accidentally gotten many party members killed by shooting a fire arrow into a barrel, only to have them be killed in the resulting explosions from a gas cloud that emerged from the barrel. There are many fun and unique ways to die, as well as kill enemies. Some fights can be over before your close-quarters guys can even reach the enemies, just by taking advantage of different material surfaces (Oil, water, gas, etc.).When you're out of combat, you're probably running around trying to solve a puzzle or interrogate someone for clues, which is all fairly enjoyable. The writing is brilliant, and pulls me right into the universe. Fortunetely, the game doesn't take itself too seriously, and will crack a joke every now and then. Sometimes the main characters will poke fun at ech other, or you'll read a silly book. The crafting system is deviously simple, and many recipies can be solved just by thinking about them for a bit. How do you make pizza sauce? Smash a tomato.My only observation about the game that could turn some people away from the game is the exteremely slow progression. I've put about 30 hours into one party at the time of this review, and they are all level 9. Compared to other RPG's, Divinity runs at a snail's pace. It doesn't bother me though. As a result of the leveling being so slow, you have to seriously consider how to allocate your skill points, instead of just throwing them in whatever sounds the best at first glance. Do I want to talk to animals, or be able to heal when I stand in blood? Do I want to be able to cast fireballs, or wield that awesome crossbow I found? You get the idea.Overall, this is easily my GOTY 2014. If you are a fan of turn-based combat and RPG's, I would highly recommend this game. Even if you aren't so keen on turn-based, the Divinity system feels oddly...Satisfying, and might just change your mind.If you're ready for an adventure, I couldn't think of a better choice.			"

												Pros :- Fun tactical turn-based combat, the environment affects your battles.- No class system for characters, you're free to choose any skill, attributes, and talent combination.- Interactive world, you can move objects around- Beautiful environments- No grinding, enemies don't respawn- No hand-holdingCons :- No hand-holding(Depends on your preference)- Story and characters, The game is not sure whether to be silly or serious.- Inventory, too much micromanagement.- No voice over for box dialoguesThe gameplay is almost perfect, it only needs a better story and better characters.If Bioware or Obsidian made a game with game's game engine, that would be perfect.Larian needs to hire better writers.EDIT : If I think about it, I don't dislike the story much, it's the characters that I don't like.

Divinity: Orignal Sin - The party based, truly oldschool CRPG you were looking forIn short: Larians latest instalment of the Divinity series proofs many publishers and devs wrong that think the only way to sell games these days is by dumbing them down as far as possible. Original Sin proofs the we gamers still very much enjoy games that keep the hand-holding to a minimum and let us explore the world on our own. It proofs that turn-based combat systems still work, that modern technology hasn't made them obsolete and that not every RPG has to be a clone of Diablo (1 and 2, not the bad one). Disclaimer: I am only 30 hours inI guess I should mention that I've only played the game for about 30 hours at the moment. I am almost done with the first of the four acts but I haven't seen the whole game yet. So, keep in mind, everything written here is based on that. I will update this review every time I finish another act.Truly OldschoolIt's sad that I feel the need to start with this, but, given how the term 'oldschool' has been abused in the recent years, it's better to be safe than sorry. 'Oldshool' doesn't mean you just use the name of an old franchise. It's not about making people that remember great games from their youth believe that your game will be similar to their somewhat romantic memories of days long gone past. And Larian gets that. What they made is a game that might not share the name of the great series of our childhood but it still feels like Ultima, Baldur's Gate or maybe even Neverwinter Nights. Divinity: Original Sin is the kind of CRPG you played back in the day.Open World ...  ish ... ?Original Sin has some Open World elements but it also can be extremely linear. This might sound controversial at first, but it truly isn't. In fact, when you ask me, the game perfectly combines the best elements from both worlds. The game is linear cos it is story-driven. There are certain things you have to do in a particular order to progress, you can't just roam through the world and explore what's going on. Well, technically you could but you probably would just end up being crushed by enemies that are way above your level. This may sound discouraging at first, especially if you are used to games like Skyrim, but on the other hand it allows for better storytelling. Okay, the story itself is not that great (at least not so far), but it still benefits from the games linear nature.The open world aspect of the game comes in form of character development and the way quests are handled. When building a character you can pretty much do what you want, your mage can wear heavy armour, your rouge can cast lightning spells to teleport across the battlefield and your warrior can summon spiders or fire elementals. Granted, not every combination is a good idea and if you want to create a jack-of-all-trades you will need to spread you skill points thin, but, if you want to, you can do it. Quests, except for the main quest line, are also very open. You can not only approach them in different ways but, based on what you do, the outcome will also differ. I can't really give you examples cos that would include spoilers, but pretty much every side quest has multiple possible endings and at least two, sometimes even four or more ways how you could do it. However, not all ways may be available to you cos some require certain skills.No Hand-holdingThe game does almost no hand-holding, at least not in the traditional sense of the term. There are (almost) no quest markers, no arrows that tell you where to go. Heck, sometimes quests only give you a vague idea of what you might have to do and then the game let's you figure it out on your own. This is appealing to a lot of us, but certainly not to everybody. Let's take the main story as an example. At the start of the game a note tells you that you have been ordered to go to Cyseal and investigate the murder of councillor Jake. That's it. You go through a short tutorial, enter Cyseal, are immediately given the opportunity to do some side quest and then you have to figure out what's going on. You have to talk to quite a few people, that are not highlighted with exclamation marks by the way, before you figure out what might have happened. However, if you do what the game wants you to do, if you talk to people, listen to their conversations and read the books you find, the game pretty much tells you what you have to do and when you have to do it. Pacing, Turn-based Combat and DifficultyTo some the pacing of Original Sin might seem too slow or off, but that's not entirely true. Granted, it takes you about 10 hours before fights start to become more interesting and you can spend a whole day running through Cyseal doing side quest that don't involve combat and just learn as much about the world as possible. So yes, if you are looking for combat the game might seem to start to slow for you, but then again, that's not what Original Sin is about.The game is a CRPG in the spirit of pen & paper RPGs like Das Schwarze Auge (engl: The Dark Eye), it is more about atmosphere and story-telling than about combat. It involves combat, a lot of it, but that's not the core mechanic.When you encounter enemies the combat is handled in turn-based mode. You get a nice ""Fight!"" displayed on the screen, your party takes position and then the combat starts. The order in which characters acts is determined by their initiative and once it's their turn they can't wait till later, so you have to ensure that your buff chars have a higher initiative than your damage dealers. How many actions a character can perform depends on his action points, the more he has the further he can walk, the more attacks he can make and so on. Unspent action points are not lost but carried over into the next round, up to a maximum of course. How difficult the game is depends heavily on how you play it. If you understand its mechanics and use them to your advantage the game can be pretty easy even on hard. Having a well rounded party also helps, 4 glass cannons won't help you, neither will 4 tanks. Elemental EffectsSo far combat doesn't sound very interesting, it's your basic CRPG turn-based stuff. However, there is more. In Original Sin you can combine elemental effects to your advantage. E.g. if you create a puddle of water - or blood - and then electrocute it with e.g. a lightning bolt everything in it will be stunned. If you let it rain fire elementals will be weaker and your chances to freeze enemies are higher, if you ignite a poison cloud it will explode and if you freeze liquids characters might slip on them (happened to the end boss of the first act, I almost fell out of my chair laughing).The FlawsOkay, so far I only mentioned the good stuff, but not game is perfect, here is a short list of the stuff Original Sin doesn't do that well:- there are only two companions that interact with you, the rest doesn't talk at all- some of the writing is really bad- pathfinding works differently in combat, your chars don't avoid deadly lava any more ConclusionBuy the game!

												I'd love to give this game a 10/10... I really would.  It's clear that the creators are true fans of old-school RPGs that required a large amount of strategy, planning, care, and investment in your characters.  In fact, I haven't even beat the game, and Ive only gotten to the second act.  Already, there are some nagging issues that impede quality of life for the player.  And I see where they are coming from.  The game is very ""non-hand-holdy"", and in a lot of senses it is great.  However, inventory management is a chore, so is crafting, so is lore-based equipment identifying, and these chores break up the gameply so heavily that it's hard to stay engaged without spending serious time doing menial tasks.  My opinion is that crafting should be done in a GW2 style, with crafting ingredients sent to a different ""stash"", and you can experiment with creating new recipies.  Items should be ID'ed upon pickup if you have the lore.  The fact that some items don't stack (dust?  of all things dust doesn't stack?) is both unusual and difficult to deal with.  These small things build and really impact my experience.  I'll review this again once I finish, but I think that small changes could make this game a 10/10 easy.Well, I've completed the game and remembered to update this:  My views haven't changed - the small, nagging, input-requiring actions are completely overkill for a game like this.  Near the end of the game with the trial, I just ended up readnig pages of walkthrough because I was just plain old bored with the game and ready to be done.  All in all, the game is pretty good, but occasionally not fun.  I'd still recommend at maybe a 7.5 or 8/10.			"

												Easily one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time.  Add to that the fact that it's turn-based AND co-op, it's a no brainer.  I'm glad I got in at the Kickstarter and I see myself playing this for a long time.			"

												I've played so much Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, etc. that I got sick of it, and never wanted to return back. This game is as close to aforementioned, as it gets. I bought it just to have a look where do those 9/10 come from. I expected to be bored in 30 minutes with it.I was wrong.This... this is a beautiful, hardcore, funny, fantasy RPG, that kept me for 71h (so far) chained to the PC. I'm around half of the game and I want more. Much of the fun comes from great, serious tactical combat. Last time I had so much fun with tactical combat, it was Silent Storm.Whether you have friends to play co-op, or you are no-life like me, if you ever liked isometric fantasy themed tactical cRPGs, buy this one.

												9/10A very well developed game.It seems that all the underlying RPG elements have been taken and built upon. Creating a great challenge and interesting story. Crafting system is a work of comical genius.The dialog system is very innovative, making options you choose develop a characters personality and enhance stats and attributes. (This is my favourite touch so far).The Graphics are beautiful.Character customisation and optimisation seems limitless and adaptive.Voice acting wears on you after a while, in my personal experience.Toolkit for creating your own campaigns. (Yet to try this out, but ive had a look at a few videos and seems comparible to Warcraft III Map Maker)The battle system:-Works on an action point system like Fallout 1, 2 and tactics.-Turn based. There is a turn bar displayed at the top, similar to the turn counter in FFX, so you can plan ahead.-Very strategic with elemental abilities and options for ambush.-Feels refreshingly well polished.Multiplayer functionality.All in all, well worth the money.

												1 hour in, I'm exploring a dungeon and after talking to a rat I learn where some secret treasure is. 11/10!22 hours in - I am hooked on this game badly. It's reminiscent of old RPG games like Baldurs Gate I & II, Neverwinter Nights and the first Dragon Age.The writing and storyline is slick, and there's a healthy dose of humour too. The tactical side of combat is very enjoyable - but this game is tough enough to keep you on your toes.I am really enjoying this game - the graphics are great, fantastic music score and huge re-playability.

No wait, it's like if Heroes of Might and Magic was actuly Torchlight, no wait... Needless to say, the devs did their homework on this one.

												Well this was a proper surprise. It turned from a gamble to a ""must have"" and this is how I would recommend it. There's good replay value to the story for different outcomes, and the banter between the two main protagonists is very good. There's hidden depth to the game on many levels and, overall, I would have to say this is most definitely one of the best RPG releases of the last few years, with it's innovative combat mechanics and sense of humour. If you're into your RPGs and love your old school gaming, this is a most definite ""must have"" buy.			"

												Intrigue and wonder. It's something I have not experienced since Oblivion when I originally played it on my 360 about 9 years ago. I remember not being able to kill the first rats and I wondered what I did wrong. Learning from mistakes and not having your handheld is what makes games great in my opinion. Environment interaction in this game is fantastic, the world broods with color and the music is great. The beginning creation is wonderful as I created myself and my girlfriend, or the rough copies of what I think we should be. This is going to be an adventure for sure. I choose not to mid-max the games I play. Especially RPGs. I would rather pick the skills I want to use and play how I want to play instead of looking up for the best optimized method of approach, whether it be in questing, farming, skills or gearing. I know that some may not agree with me, but role playing games are just that. Role playing. I try to immersve myself in the ""role"" as much as I can and I try to do the things that myself or my particular character would do, not for the sake of mastering every aspect of the game. Even though I am just scratching the surface of this game, I am quite surprised so far and very happy of what I am experiencing.			"

												This game at first seems a little slow and maybe a bit bland for the first 20 minutes to 1 hour but then it becomes a different animal altogether. - Fights on 'Hard' are actually hard and playing with another person online actually adds an extreme amount of depth to the game.- Quests are impactful, decisions are important and ripple throught the storyline and your class actually grows  in importance with each increase in level. - Playing through multiple times is a very different experience with different classes/quest choices.- Getting involved in crafting and actually reading in-game books for tips will turn your experience upside down. Every item actually has a purpose, reading books will tell you what they do!- Hidden areas and figuring out puzzles encourages co-op team play and is very fun.- Very in-depth storyline with very little guidance. Leaves the player to figure it out by themselves instead of the hand-holding modern day games all have.- Large variety of items to find (scrolls, special arrows, books). - Cross-class system.9.5/10 and one of the best games in a long time. If you begin playing this and think you are missing something, check crafting and other abilities out on the web... the game is much deeper than you might think.			"

												This is a good sequel to the first ever divinity i played 10 years ago with better graphic. The game is for people who actually want to enjoy a good content and storyline game. Many ways to solve a quest and the open world you can kill any person u see. When i finished all my quest in first map i killed all the people in town to gain more exp and loot their stuff. The coop is also very fun. For those who wants another boring and easy hack and slash and loot game aka diablo etc. This is not for you. Game is quite hard at the begining but gets easier through the game, you can't wonder around in the wild with low level. You get annilated even by some wolf when at low level. But as you level up by doing some quest which does not require battle, you feel the complishment and reward well worth the time. And you have to actually read the dialogue cause maybe one misclick, the NPC shoot a lighting arrow and turn you into ash. So quicksave is your best friend.The skills are fun too, you can pretty much create anything with the right ingredient and crafting skill. Sell them to merchant to get better equipment. Or simply steal and lockpick. YOUR choice.Also during combat, use the element magic to your advantage, take some water barrel , throw them at the enemy and shoot a lighting at them, u can see they are electrified and stuned. So many ways to defeat a boss when you cant face to face.overall a good game well worth the money and time. "

												It's a fantastic game, and if you've played e.g Divine Divinity you know what to expect. A fantastical RPG game which doesn't take itself very seriously.It has all the necessary trappings, character development, quests, magic, monsters and lots of mayhem. Like the previous games it also has a lot of things you are free to break, and lots of ways to do it. A guard bothering you? Teleport him out of the way. A big baddie too tough? Bring him back to town and let the guards take care of him.As for new things, the way you develop your characters is well done and a new take on the old formula, but it works rather well. The magic system is ingenious and fun to play around with. The dual characters and the role playing happening between them is a welcome break from the rest of the game.All that needs to be said though is buy it! Buy it and make your friends buy it so you can teleport them into lava and laugh at their misfortune.			"

												Okay, first off I'll try to write this review in assumption that half of you reading have played games like this (Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights) while the other half aren't really familiar with the DnD playstyle.The Good:1) Visually satisfying. The environment, character modles, and partical effects of spells are stunning. I could try to describe it with and do it little justice. So just look at some screenshots and some gameplay videos. I'll try to reveal things about the game that you don't usually get from watching other people play.2) Soundtrack is quite stellar as well, again though i won't do it much justice by describing it, just watch someone stream it on Twitch.tv3) Lore/Story. I wont give anything away about the actual story, so I'll just describe how the game handles quest and such. It's a non-linear style questing system, so you can just go about your business and do whatever you want. There is a main questline in which you can progress through the main/side quests without going through a set series of NPCs to talk to. You need to find a missing NPC? You dont need to have the quest before hand. Exampl: NPC needs you to find a missing item. You can stumble upon it and retrieve it without having the quest and when the NPC requests you to find the item, you can present it to them. That goes with almost all other kinds of quests. 4) Crafting. Quite fun. The crafting is like MInecraft's system in a sense that you can make anything just know YOU (the player) personally know the what do combine. The only contributes in which crafting skills add is to unlock higher tiered items to make and crafting time (from what I've noticed). There are books in-game that have a fun (fun for me) description on how to craft stuff. A crafitng book may have a flavor like. . . ""I'm no lumberjack, but anytime I come across a log, I take my trusty axe to get some. I'll whittle it away with a knife to make a couple of stakes, and those blasted wizards always want some of the leftover woodchips for some reason."" So that recipe pretty much tells you to get logs from in-game environmental logs on the ground. Combine a knife and a log to make a stake and woodchips. Other examples of how to craft is by combining Flour and Water to make Dough. Combine a hammer to a tomato to make tomato sauce. Combine the sauce and dough to make pizza dough. Toss that into an oven to make a pizza!Oh, and this made me EXCEEDLING happy when I found out that you can combine a Fly Agaric Mushroom and an Empty Flask to make a Poison Potion. THEN! you can combine it with a weapon, and your weapon will have a permanent Poison x-y damage. I'm still trying out some of the other crafting stuff, so there's still a lot to find out.5) Combat. The nitty gritty of the game. It's turned base combat. The order in turns is determined by how much Intiative you have and it is affected by your Speed attribute; there are a total of 5 attribute stats: Strengh, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed, Perception. EVERYTHING in combat is dicated by Action Points (AP), there is no mana to cast spells; they all run on AP and cooldown timers (in turns, ie: 3 turn cooldown). You want to walk over to that zombie and start unloading on him? You need to spend AP to move there AND then spend more AP to swing your weapon. Movement dictates how many meters you can walk in 1 AP. Movement is affected by type of armor (heavier gives you a movement penalty, but can be reduced or removed with ability points), and the Speed attribute also dictates your movement. Various attribute stats also affect your Maximum AP, Starting AP, and Per Turn AP. Maximum Ap is pretty self-explanitory. Your starting AP determines how much of your max AP you have at the very beginning of the battle. Your Per Turn AP helps you gain more AP per turn. You may also save or roll-over unused AP to unleash on a monster that you just tripped (tripped/stunned monsters have a 100% to be hit). Different types of weapons inherintly use more or less AP. Daggers use 2, one-handed Axes/Swords/Maces use 3. Two-handed weapons use 4(two-handed axes/swords/staves). Bows use 4, and Crossbows use 6. I believe.Okay, phew. Now that AP is taken cared of. Actual combat is quite challenging. It is imperative when battle is initiated that you analyze the battlefield, since all encounters have been hand-placed by the devs, each of the have different playstyle flavors. Some encounters will be better utilized if you have a wizard throw a fireball at barrels of oil to it will light up and burn them all. Or some encounters may favor a sneaky rogue backstabbing (backstabs have a 100% to crit) those mages in the back before your party rushes in. Analyzing the battlefield is so important, not just because of the combination of the monsters and their positions but environmental factors also play a huge role. Elemental Synergy has been worked in this game beautifully. You see enemies standing in a puddle of water? Throw a lightening bolt in it and it will stun anyone in the puddle. Don't have a lightening skill? Throw a fireball or have a ranger shoot a fire arrow in the water to turn it into vapor-- which will obscure vision from those pesky archers *Beware, though, your vision is also hindered behind the vapor* One of the available abilities in the game is Loremaster, which also allows you to identify magical items to see their properties. It also allows you to view the stats of the enemies whening holding down CTRL. With higher levels of Loremaster you'll be able to see the enemies Hp/Max HP, AP/Max AP, Resistances, Armor. Also if you like lore or you just like to be immersed in your games and read a lot/everything you can stumble upon useful information like, this archeologists tells you that skeletons are more resistant to piercing damage but if you have a mace or any crushing damage, their bones will turn to dust. Later on, you can find out through other spells that skeletons have a 75% resistance to piercing damage and take extra damage from crushing.6) Co-op. I had generally wanted to list this in ""The Bad"" section only because the game limits you to two players, but there are available mods to make it into 4. I personally exptec it to be a 4 player game because its predecessor (Baldur's Gate & Neverwinter Nights) had 4 players, odd decision to go to a 2 player cap. ALTHOUGH, how many people really have 4 friends to really dive into the lore and play for hours and hours and only be level 2 or 3. So there's the counter-argument. Otherwise, the co-op is superb. The host saves and loads but there are also drop-in and drop-out public gameplay. One of the features in this game allows the two main characters (both single and co-op) to both react to environmental factors or decisions. Early on, you find Ishmashell and you have two opposing options. One essentially good, the other evil. If both of you decide two different options there will be a rock-paper-scissors minigame. You need to score 10 points to win and have your way. If you have charm/intimidate/reason points then every win you get awards you the respective points. Someone with 4 intimidate battles someone with 2 reason, the person with 4 intimidate only needs to win 3 games; whereas, the latter person needs to win 5 games. This applies to trying to intimidate/reason/charm NPCs.I will post 'The Bad' section on another post. I am running out of room.			"

												The game starts you off on a beach away from the main town you will be starting in. You will hit combat pretty early and find that it is indeed turn based. Anything outside of combat however is in real time. Most skills can be used in and out of combat for various effects. Mastering these skills and when to use them will be critical for your success when exploring the world and fighting off the baddies. A common complaint is the difficulty of combat. The combat is hard at first. Since it is turnbased many people approach it like they would Final Fantasy Tactics. Rush your melee in close while sniping with ranged. While this MAY work in some cases here, it is best to understand your skills and use them in the best way possible. For example, running in with a melee character will allow him/her to take aggro nine times out of ten, but with overwhelming numbers, his HP will be hard to restore, even with health potions and spells. Crowd control will often times set this plan on the path for failure; knocked down units (Ally or Hostile) will automatically get hit 100% of the time. Meaning that tank of yours just got hit twice by every enemy on the map. Think about your moves:-What would happen if you backed up around this giant rock and let the melee come to you?-Is there any special barrels around to set off at the right moments?-What spells do I have? Should I skip my turn to combo them next turn?-My tank is in danger, should I teleport him out and inflict friendly fire damage?-There is just too many! Should I escape and try again later?If you can get past the difficulty of combat, I can guarentee that many RPG fans will enjoy this game. BUYER BEWARE: This game is kind of like The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind in regards to no quest marker. The developers have done a fantastic job in not holding your hand while playing. You have to think, read, remember, keep track of everything. You never know what you'll need to solve the various mysteries and quests. There are bugs, and the developers have already been working their butts off to patch them and make this game even better. The game supports Steam Workshop and the fourms are flooded with amazing ideas that I cannot wait to come to life to bring infinite replayability to the game.			"

												Playe for like 20 hours now and it is a complete blast. The quests are fun and original and the emenies are waried and offer different tactics for you to use in combat. So far I have allied myself with a half dwarf and som crazy demon hunter and med an amazing imp named ZixZax. And you can kill♥♥♥♥♥♥and run and do quests and kill more stuff and steal picturers and alot of other stuff. It's cinda like a dieablo skyrim mixture with som amazing quests and fun conversations. Not all conversations is voiced though so if you don't like to read you are going to have a bad time. But if you like klicking and interacting with everything then the quest should go fine. It doesn't seem like you can become a badass dragon in this game though :/ But still worth a buy. I give this game 10/10 personally, and profersionally 8,5/10.			"

However, you need to be aware that the game requires a lot of micromanaging for your group, since the UI doesn't do anything to help you guide your characters or find out where to go next. Also, there's an insane amount of traps all over the game, which is pretty annoying. If you can look past that, it's an ok game.			"

												As someone who is relatively new to turn-based RPGs, I was hesistant to play this game. The art style is incredible and completely suits the soundtrack accompaniment. Many NPCs unnecessarily have dialogue, especially market vendors, which began to infuriate me to the point that I wanted to throw my speakers at the person who bought me this game. I found the gameplay progressed a little too slowly for my liking and although it was good in some aspects that there was limited handholding, I would have appreciated a little bit of direction in the beginning. The turn-based combat was fun, albeit a little tough to get used to (but as I said I am new to this game style). I did find it annoying that the characters always took the most dangerous path during combat usually walking through fire or acid. The Co-Op idea is great in theory, not so great in initial practice. I was under the impression it was a drop in/out Co-Op and this is definitely not the case. If you were not the initial host but want to play some more of the game, too bad you get to start all over again, or wait to play with your friend again. Also, if you want to have a specific main character you better get the host to create it how you want otherwise you are stuck with whatever they create. Trying to get a Co-Op game going took me and my playmate over an hour to sort out. 7.5/10 - The Co-Op initial setup soured me on this game so much that my care factor about the story is severely limited. I will keep on playing it, but would be more inclined to replay Diablo 3 over this at this stage.			"

												This game is so cool. One of the games which was worth backing in early access. Story is interesting and fun to play, graphic is nice. The turn based system works nice and the environment plays an important role, for example you can use puddles to spread you lightning spells across the map. Still there is one many negative point i have to mention: Back when i played it (i dont know if this was patched out) it was realy easy to distract the enemys with summoned elementals. They focused them even if they did fire damage to an fire elemental which just healed it. So the AI had some problems here.However, besides that, and if you dont abuse it, the game is great to play with some friends, and even if the story is not to inventive, solving the murder (one of the frist quests) was very cool and enjoyable!

There is a degree of freedom in the design, that does not keep you 100% inside that classical fantasy feel. You will find enemies that look more like they are taken from a Marvel comic book at times. So while it has all the features of an old school top-down party-RPG, it sometimes strays a bit from the expected path of a ""classical fantasy world"" and goes into a slight humorous direction.			"

												TL;DR: Fantastic, as long as you don't mind the slow progression pace.Divinity: Original Sin has become one of my new favorites. Starting with the simple, it's a turn-based ""tactical"" RPG. You can control up to a party of 4, and you cycle through your characters in an order based on their (and their enemies') initiative stat. In combat, you fire off spells and hack away at enemies in this turn-based fashion. It may sound dull to some, but every choice counts in a battle, especially if you are facing a boss or a group that is a higher level than you are. If you play any other RPG. you would probably not think twice about taking on a level 6 enemy when you're level 5, it would just take a bit longer, right? In DIvinity, although it is possible with the right strategy, taking on a group that is one level higher than yours can result in your enemies to steamroll over your group. It can be quite hard, especially before you get a hang of the combat system.The combat is very satisfying; it looks good, sounds good, and your characters deal a significant amount of damage whenever you get an attack off. The difficulty doesn't come from the enemies being arrow-sponges, it comes from your own mistakes. While shooting a fire arrow into a oil surface sounds great at first, you soon realize that your archers and mages cannot see through the smoke, forcing you to wait for the black clouds to disperse. I've personally accidentally gotten many party members killed by shooting a fire arrow into a barrel, only to have them be killed in the resulting explosions from a gas cloud that emerged from the barrel. There are many fun and unique ways to die, as well as kill enemies. Some fights can be over before your close-quarters guys can even reach the enemies, just by taking advantage of different material surfaces (Oil, water, gas, etc.).When you're out of combat, you're probably running around trying to solve a puzzle or interrogate someone for clues, which is all fairly enjoyable. The writing is brilliant, and pulls me right into the universe. Fortunetely, the game doesn't take itself too seriously, and will crack a joke every now and then. Sometimes the main characters will poke fun at ech other, or you'll read a silly book. The crafting system is deviously simple, and many recipies can be solved just by thinking about them for a bit. How do you make pizza sauce? Smash a tomato.My only observation about the game that could turn some people away from the game is the exteremely slow progression. I've put about 30 hours into one party at the time of this review, and they are all level 9. Compared to other RPG's, Divinity runs at a snail's pace. It doesn't bother me though. As a result of the leveling being so slow, you have to seriously consider how to allocate your skill points, instead of just throwing them in whatever sounds the best at first glance. Do I want to talk to animals, or be able to heal when I stand in blood? Do I want to be able to cast fireballs, or wield that awesome crossbow I found? You get the idea.Overall, this is easily my GOTY 2014. If you are a fan of turn-based combat and RPG's, I would highly recommend this game. Even if you aren't so keen on turn-based, the Divinity system feels oddly...Satisfying, and might just change your mind.If you're ready for an adventure, I couldn't think of a better choice.			"

												I'm about 30 hours into the game and it still is very fun to play.The story is well written and there are lots of sidequests(I just left the first area of the game). Quests are fun and some of them really challange you to discover and look for clues. I'll just sum op some pros and cons to help you decide if this is something for you.Pros:Difficult Turn-Based CombatMages gallore!(elemental spells make the combat very tactical)Lots of questsWell writtenFun conversationsLots of companions to choose fromDecide how to end every quest(f.e.: help the mayor get his staff back or tell him that you'll keep it in the end)Great coop-options! Rock-paper-siccors to solve arguments in gameCons:Slow start(after reaching the first village there will be a lot of reading)Combat can be tedious especially for melee heavy groups.(f.e. some fights a warrior can be stunned/frozen etc for the whole duration)Rock-paper-siccors is also used to determine the answer to riddles(f.e.: you know the answer to a riddle, but the AI 'doubts' you, resulting in a rock-paper-siccor minigame which will determine if your 'right' answer is chosen or... the AI will rampage you into failing the riddle).

Early Access Review
								This game is a gleaming reminder of what made me fall in love with RPG's over a dozen years ago. Like Fallout, Planescape and Baulder's Gate before it, it boasts a great combat system, charming characters, memorable music and a living, breathing world to adventure in. There are a few modern improvements though, like more physics-based interactions with the environment and a good amount of depth in character creation and development. My only complaints would be that in its current (beta) form, some of the animations are a bit clunky and fully voiced dialogue is extremely sparse. Those issues are soon forgotten, as the game does an excellent job of immersing you in its world. NPCs will talk to eachother often, and the game finds a great balance between witty humor and interesting banter. Your party members will speak up and comment on things, giving them life and value. Player choice affects not only the story, but how your own party members view you. Early in the game, I found myself delving in dungeons that I could have easily skipped, stealing items from a shop while using a party member to distract them, and killing people that didn't need to die just because they were rude to me. It's those kind of things that pull you in and keep you up late at night.If you like Diablo, Elder Scrolls and classics like Fallout, you will almost certainly like this game. And the fact that a game this deep has online co-op is fantastic. I could go on and on, but I've just scratched the surface and the game is calling me back. Can't wait for the full version!			"

								It mixes action or a typical exploration RPG with turn based combat. Yes I do recommend this game. I just purchased it and love it so far. I have been holding off for Pillars but lately the reviews and gameplay videos have sucked me into this, have been eyeing it for awhile now.It's sorta like - heres your world do what you want with it. As it should be.Don't buy it if you don't want to read. It definetly has some old school cRPG essence in there. Fans of rpgs..not the DS2 kind.. will like it.(DS2 is not an rpg but an action game) Top down view ..can zoom in. Good music and graphics.I have played Buldars Gate, Neverwinter Nights, PS:T,FF7/FFT all of those. Warcraft 3 took me (and guild) away from EQ 1 for a bit. I am a picky gamer. But so far I feel this has alot of potential and like what I see. Solid RPG straight up.			"

												How this handles battles, compared to other games.Other games:-Hit them a few times, maybe use a couple spells. You're stronger than them.This game:-Drop oil around an enemy-Set the oil on fire, causing an explosion-Fire a poison dart, causing another explosion-Have your partner leave the battle, then sneak back in to backstab the enemy(s)-Summon a spider to tank damage-Teleport other enemies on to the already burning oil-Shoot the nearby water barrel to weaken the fire enemy-Kill the final enemy, the fire one, with your spider.Then, throw in some incredible sidequests, such as a murder investigation with multiple paths and false leads, and achievements, great voice acting and a sense of humour, and what do you get?Divinity: Original Sin			"

												This is CRPG done right: non-linear questing, meaningful character development, deep turn based tactical combat, a consistently interactive world, cool loot, crafting, lore, humour, etc. I cannot thank the developers enough for the commitment they had to bringing a quality modern-day successor to old-school crpgs. The game literally feels like it combined the best and most complex systems of older rpgs, and then upgraded them while adding a few original twists to them. It has the tactical combat of something like the temple of elemental evil (perhaps a bit more streamlined, but superior in depth and challenge), the interactive world of something like fallout 1 or 2 (but again, with much better implemented and more varied systems), the lore and scope of the likes of baldur's gate 2, and more than a few new ideas of its own to keep things interesting. And most importantly, everything ties in well together to form a coherent, consistent sand box of rpg experimentation. Be warned however! This game requires an insane commitment of time and attention. There are so many things to micromanage. But that is exactly what I love about it. It is not a simple matter of grinding until your numbers are high enough. It rewards patience, exploration, experimentation and careful decision making. It is entirely possible to screw yourself over completely in this game... which again, makes for an awesome role playing experience. Progress does not come swiftly or at a steady pace. There may long stretches of time when you are just trying to figure out the best way to outfit your characters. You might spend an hour navigating a house full of traps and figuring out how to get all of the loot without blowing yourself up. You might spend some time learning recipes and crafting items. You might be reloading the same battle 5-10 times. There are literally endless possibilities of both emergent and prescripted gameplay...I can only hope that Larian studios, as well as other developers, get the message and start making more games like these.

												First off, if you like classic RPGs pick this game up right off the bat.This game is beautifully designed with a great atmosphere and stunning visuals coupled with one heck of a soundtrack to boot.Combat is fluid and satisfying once you get a couple of the more advanced spells.Spells can combo off each other into a spectacular explosion or a poison cloud or a ... you get the point.And with two players it gets even better, if you don't kill each other first that is.The dialogue often throws choices at the player(s) so you get to debate with your friend... in a game of rock, paper, scissors.Should we kill those people? Rock, paper, scissors.Should we help that guy?Rock, paper, scissors. Killing everyone on sight works too of course.While I won't spoil anything, the story in this game is the only thing quite mediocre.Granted the experience itself with my friend was one of the best thing I have ever played through.All in all this is a fantastic CRPG for anyone be it gamers new to the genre or seasoned D&D fans.Screw around, kill civilians, wear a bucket, or strip naked and try to attack someone with a spoon.TL;DR - Fun turn-base tomfoolery 9/10.

												You know those games where it feels like the devs took time to make sure even the little aspects of the games had significant time spent on them? This is one of those games.One common flaw in turn based tactical games is the combat is just not tactical enough. D:OS does an amazing job with their skill system combined with the environmental dangers on the battlefield. I found I wasn't doing well until I was utilizing the environment in almost every battle, and it is awesome.Co-op games are so easy to set up! I had 0 issues getting my friend in my game and its fast every game. If I had one issue with the game it comes in this category though. Conversations started by one person are difficult and sometimes not observable by the other player. I want to see that amazing story too!Are there bugs? Yes, but nothing gamebreaking and not many considering it just released. The one bug I kept encountering they fixed in one of their 4 small patches in 4 days anyways. I love knowing the devs won't wait forever to patch this game.			"

												In the short time of played this game I have becone addicted. A majority of my time was AFK, but non the less, it is far better then i expected. Its well written, graphics are enjoyable and feels familiar while managing to be somthing very new. I enjoy the combonations of past game types rolled into one. The turn base combat is well done, and you actually need to pay attention to story and details. It can be VERY complicated, which is a nice change of pace for people getting bored of current RPGs/MMOs. You are forced to think, and save, before every move which makes for an even more gratefying experience. Buy it with a friend or for yourself, Its well worth the money. Havent ran into any bugs as of yet, but my friend has. So far no complaints. Please enjoy :)			"

												As someone who is relatively new to turn-based RPGs, I was hesistant to play this game. The art style is incredible and completely suits the soundtrack accompaniment. Many NPCs unnecessarily have dialogue, especially market vendors, which began to infuriate me to the point that I wanted to throw my speakers at the person who bought me this game. I found the gameplay progressed a little too slowly for my liking and although it was good in some aspects that there was limited handholding, I would have appreciated a little bit of direction in the beginning. The turn-based combat was fun, albeit a little tough to get used to (but as I said I am new to this game style). I did find it annoying that the characters always took the most dangerous path during combat usually walking through fire or acid. The Co-Op idea is great in theory, not so great in initial practice. I was under the impression it was a drop in/out Co-Op and this is definitely not the case. If you were not the initial host but want to play some more of the game, too bad you get to start all over again, or wait to play with your friend again. Also, if you want to have a specific main character you better get the host to create it how you want otherwise you are stuck with whatever they create. Trying to get a Co-Op game going took me and my playmate over an hour to sort out. 7.5/10 - The Co-Op initial setup soured me on this game so much that my care factor about the story is severely limited. I will keep on playing it, but would be more inclined to replay Diablo 3 over this at this stage.			"

												TL;DR: Fantastic, as long as you don't mind the slow progression pace.Divinity: Original Sin has become one of my new favorites. Starting with the simple, it's a turn-based ""tactical"" RPG. You can control up to a party of 4, and you cycle through your characters in an order based on their (and their enemies') initiative stat. In combat, you fire off spells and hack away at enemies in this turn-based fashion. It may sound dull to some, but every choice counts in a battle, especially if you are facing a boss or a group that is a higher level than you are. If you play any other RPG. you would probably not think twice about taking on a level 6 enemy when you're level 5, it would just take a bit longer, right? In DIvinity, although it is possible with the right strategy, taking on a group that is one level higher than yours can result in your enemies to steamroll over your group. It can be quite hard, especially before you get a hang of the combat system.The combat is very satisfying; it looks good, sounds good, and your characters deal a significant amount of damage whenever you get an attack off. The difficulty doesn't come from the enemies being arrow-sponges, it comes from your own mistakes. While shooting a fire arrow into a oil surface sounds great at first, you soon realize that your archers and mages cannot see through the smoke, forcing you to wait for the black clouds to disperse. I've personally accidentally gotten many party members killed by shooting a fire arrow into a barrel, only to have them be killed in the resulting explosions from a gas cloud that emerged from the barrel. There are many fun and unique ways to die, as well as kill enemies. Some fights can be over before your close-quarters guys can even reach the enemies, just by taking advantage of different material surfaces (Oil, water, gas, etc.).When you're out of combat, you're probably running around trying to solve a puzzle or interrogate someone for clues, which is all fairly enjoyable. The writing is brilliant, and pulls me right into the universe. Fortunetely, the game doesn't take itself too seriously, and will crack a joke every now and then. Sometimes the main characters will poke fun at ech other, or you'll read a silly book. The crafting system is deviously simple, and many recipies can be solved just by thinking about them for a bit. How do you make pizza sauce? Smash a tomato.My only observation about the game that could turn some people away from the game is the exteremely slow progression. I've put about 30 hours into one party at the time of this review, and they are all level 9. Compared to other RPG's, Divinity runs at a snail's pace. It doesn't bother me though. As a result of the leveling being so slow, you have to seriously consider how to allocate your skill points, instead of just throwing them in whatever sounds the best at first glance. Do I want to talk to animals, or be able to heal when I stand in blood? Do I want to be able to cast fireballs, or wield that awesome crossbow I found? You get the idea.Overall, this is easily my GOTY 2014. If you are a fan of turn-based combat and RPG's, I would highly recommend this game. Even if you aren't so keen on turn-based, the Divinity system feels oddly...Satisfying, and might just change your mind.If you're ready for an adventure, I couldn't think of a better choice.			"

												Pros :- Fun tactical turn-based combat, the environment affects your battles.- No class system for characters, you're free to choose any skill, attributes, and talent combination.- Interactive world, you can move objects around- Beautiful environments- No grinding, enemies don't respawn- No hand-holdingCons :- No hand-holding(Depends on your preference)- Story and characters, The game is not sure whether to be silly or serious.- Inventory, too much micromanagement.- No voice over for box dialoguesThe gameplay is almost perfect, it only needs a better story and better characters.If Bioware or Obsidian made a game with game's game engine, that would be perfect.Larian needs to hire better writers.EDIT : If I think about it, I don't dislike the story much, it's the characters that I don't like. They're boring.			"

												A pretty amazing achievement as far as RPGs go, and games in general. It definitely harkens back to the Ultima series and Baldur's Gate in terms of story, depth and interactivity. I like that it doesn't hold your hand, yet is still pretty accessible. The amount of interactivity is staggering. The graphics are gorgeous and rich, and the gameplay is a lot of fun. The combat is challenging - you will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked if you aren't carerful, but it is fun and very strategic. Being able to use certain elements to your advantage (lighting oil on fire underneath a monster or electrocuting them in water) adds another layer to your strategy. I've barely scratched the surface on this game, but I'm incredibly impressed and very happy I purchased it. It's a masterpiece, and will go down as one of the greatest computer RPGs ever made. It is in very good company.			"

												Playe for like 20 hours now and it is a complete blast. The quests are fun and original and the emenies are waried and offer different tactics for you to use in combat. So far I have allied myself with a half dwarf and som crazy demon hunter and med an amazing imp named ZixZax. And you can kill♥♥♥♥♥♥and run and do quests and kill more stuff and steal picturers and alot of other stuff. It's cinda like a dieablo skyrim mixture with som amazing quests and fun conversations. Not all conversations is voiced though so if you don't like to read you are going to have a bad time. But if you like klicking and interacting with everything then the quest should go fine. It doesn't seem like you can become a badass dragon in this game though :/ But still worth a buy. I give this game 10/10 personally, and profersionally 8,5/10.			"

												Yes. - The feeling of CRPG, Isometric Turn Based Party RPG with AP system.- 2 protagonists and you can argue between yourself. - Elemental combo effect like Magicka rarely happen in RPG games.- A really make sense RPG game unlike WOW (In WOW Undead/Robot can get poison damage, or Skeleton can bleed/poisoned). At here, you plan your fight carefully. Some skills powerful in a fight might not useful in another.- Unleash your creativity on the combat and elemental combo. Such as taking a water barrel into your inventory. Throw it to group of enemy, destroy the barrel to create water puddle. Now zap it.RPG of the year for me, if not RPG of the Decade.			"

												This is CRPG done right: non-linear questing, meaningful character development, deep turn based tactical combat, a consistently interactive world, cool loot, crafting, lore, humour, etc. I cannot thank the developers enough for the commitment they had to bringing a quality modern-day successor to old-school crpgs. The game literally feels like it combined the best and most complex systems of older rpgs, and then upgraded them while adding a few original twists to them. It has the tactical combat of something like the temple of elemental evil (perhaps a bit more streamlined, but superior in depth and challenge), the interactive world of something like fallout 1 or 2 (but again, with much better implemented and more varied systems), the lore and scope of the likes of baldur's gate 2, and more than a few new ideas of its own to keep things interesting. And most importantly, everything ties in well together to form a coherent, consistent sand box of rpg experimentation. Be warned however! This game requires an insane commitment of time and attention. There are so many things to micromanage. But that is exactly what I love about it. It is not a simple matter of grinding until your numbers are high enough. It rewards patience, exploration, experimentation and careful decision making. It is entirely possible to screw yourself over completely in this game... which again, makes for an awesome role playing experience. Progress does not come swiftly or at a steady pace. There may long stretches of time when you are just trying to figure out the best way to outfit your characters. You might spend an hour navigating a house full of traps and figuring out how to get all of the loot without blowing yourself up. You might spend some time learning recipes and crafting items. You might be reloading the same battle 5-10 times. There are literally endless possibilities of both emergent and prescripted gameplay...I can only hope that Larian studios, as well as other developers, get the message and start making more games like these.

It's like Fallout 2 and Baldur's Gate 2 had a baby, then decided to let you toy with the world in ways you've always wanted to but never could. Strategic on all fronts with a serviceable story and just about zero hand holding. Combat is a joy and the game looks fantastic. At $40 Larian is practically giving this game away. I knew I was going to enjoy it, had no clue I was going to get absolutely consumed by the game. Been too long since an RPG has sucked me in like this one. Buy it, love it.

At certain points you end up sinking lots of time into item management instead of actually playing the game.  Other than that I love it.			"

												This is my first review on Steam, although I have written reviews on other services, but given that I will merely enumerate a few high-level points given there are probably a hundred better reviews already.1) Combat is difficult on Normal, but with some thought and experience you can win, and win in style.  Be patient, save right before each fight so that you can reload if you make a tactical mistake.  Winning a battle in D:OS gives you a real sense of satisfaction.2) Gold is difficult to come by early on if you do not steal.  I am not a thief therefore I had to scrimp and save to obtain gold early on.  That extra scroll, potion, armor, etc. can be key in the combat so make that early gold count.3) I tend to be thrifty with single-use items like scrolls, health potions, etc. but again, to win a close battle and not lose any of your team members you may need to sacrifice going for damage and burn action points to quaff that potion.The game is very in-depth, a good challenge, with nice graphics, humorous moments, and a nice mix of quests (I am only up to the Silverglen area so I cannot speak to the entirety of the game at this time.)  The game world is large, and is an ""open world"" but the level of the enemies encountered make it linear to a degree in reality as you simply will not survive the fights if you veer too far off the path.

												You can explore dungeons, wilderness, urban, fight monsters & NPCS (turn-based,) roleplay with PCs/NPCs, and solve traps, tricks, & puzzles. You participate in a ""story"" through quests in this fantasy RPG world. What makes this game unique-- Compelling array of magical spells that can be cast tactically during combat so as to combine with each other, and create effects and injure opoonents. For example, casting an oil slick to slow an target, then igniting it and the target with a fire spell. Alternatively, chilling an opponent and then freezing it. The possiblities are large. An engaging wilderness environment. Combat that is amazingly balanced, almost perfectly to the character levels. Combat that is intense, interesting, and challenging. Beautiful graphics. A reward systems of skills, talents, etc that allow you to customise the character uniquely. A well-paced game that is neither dull nor hugely exciting but then you suffer a large period of boredom -- no, the game is consistently paced.This game can be addictive it is that good.Each of these good points may not seem special, but when you combineall of them together you get Divinity Original Sin (I know it sounds corny but it's true).This is one of the greatest games of the last 15 years. Of course, benefits continue: you have multi-player; you can select a certain ""class"" but ultimately create whatever you want, literally anything, within the bounds of traits, talents, ability scores, etc; which gives you huge scope to customise characters from the start and throughout the game. You create and control more than one character at a time.Buy this game.			"

												Divinity: Original Sin is a throwback to what Action RPGs used to be.  When I was a young adult back in the late 90s early 2000s we had games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, and Nox.  These games, while real-time based (technically based on DND rules), flowed well and the envrionment was at your disposal.  Divinity should not be compared to any of these games as the gameplay itself may be similar but some of the major elements are still missing.  Divinity is a turn based action RPG based in the Divinity world.  You don't need any former knowledge of the series but you will see some appearances and references to other games.  The world is, in my opinion, a medium sized world that captures your attention and makes it feel much larger due to several factors.  First, everything is usable or can be modified from one state to another.  Some of this comes into play during combat.  In fact, some battles that could not normally be won until a later level can be won earlier if you play your battle correctly.  Oil barrels that explode upon getting hit by a fireball, poison barrels that lay poison onto the ground which can be ignited by fire, and water that can be electrically charged, stunning everything in its area.  These are all aspects of a battle that can be turned against you or the enemy, don't forget, blood conducts electric too, so that blood puddle isn't something you want to stand in if a mage is slamming bolts everywhere!The one thing that really intrigues me as well as adds points to the game is the difficulty.  This game, as said before, is a throwback to the old school games of the early part of last decade.  There are no quest markers or hand holding.  You need to figure things out for yourself and this could be a turn off to the new generation of gamers.  Please don't take this as an insult but most newer games step you through the entire game, Divinity does no such thing.  The map is useful for markers that you can place, town areas of interest, secret boxes marked on your map, and waypoints.  With no handholding you are left to fend for yourself, this often entails you wandering for a few minutes until you get your bearings.  Walls of text that can get in the way and have no meaning to the current quest line can get annoying but are there to help you immerse yourself.  Quests can often go either way, kill the troll or let him live.  Sometimes you find friends in the strangest areas, so before you go blasting into combat make sure that the skeleton you get your eyes on isn't a friendly.That brings me to the combat which is extremely well designed.  Everything is turn based meaning that each character goes and does what he/she does for their turn and then it is the next characters turn, friend or foe.  Action points make up your characters ability set and define how many things they can do in a given turn.  Walking, attacking, casting most spells, and drinking potions all consume action points.  The good news is, if you want, you can save up your action points to a certain amount and unload three, four, or even five attacks in one turn.  This adds an element to the combat that makes it strategic.  Some spells cost so much that you need to wait one turn to even cast them while other spells have a cooldown regardless of how many action points you have stored up.  As you level your characters you quickly learn how to lose professionally.  Enemies two levels above you can completely pulverize your party unless you got a trick up your sleeve.  However, the level difference begins to get a little easier as you get more powerful.  Character creation is somewhat of a detailed job that you can easily spend an hour getting right.  The classes presented to you are merely templates as you can modify them to be anything.  Want a geomancer with pyromancing abilities? Go for it.  Want a mage that can wear heavy armor and cast spells?  Sure, go for it.  You do end up sacrificing some things over others as going the latter route will undoubtly have you suffering in one aspect or the other eventually but it is still a viable jack of all trades class.  I am a personal fan of the Red Mage play style so when I can get a party to have a red mage I do it.  On a final note on character creation, you have to create two as the story line does entail two protagonists, so your other two party members will be whomever you choose as you go throughout the game.As far as the graphics go, the game is good enough.  Nothing stellar but it was never designed in that fashion.  The music rocks and the voice overs are nice.  The game can run on high end systems with no issues and even on middle and low end systems fluidly.Now with every review comes a few of the bad things.  First I would like to point out that you need to read the manual.  This isn't a flaw or a bad thing for me but again, the newer generation wants everything done for them as games are designed in this fashion.  Another flaw is that sometimes you intend to attack an enemy via melee but your character moves around them instead.  I have had this happen a few times and it gets irritating to say the least.  I haven't lost a battle because of this but it drags out some battles an extra turn when it could have been over earlier.  My other complain is the walls of text I referred to earlier.  Sometimes you end up reading a page out of a book from one conversation before the point is made.  While this adds depth, doing this to often gets tiresome, especially when you are eager to go out and whoop some butt.  Overall, Divinity: Original Sin does the old days justice.  It captures what made games so good back then and then amplifies it to another level.  I was really hoping for an open world in which I could go anywhere and do anything.  While you can do as you wish, some areas are just way to powerful for you and you get spanked.  The story has a set path that you will be at certain points at certain levels, give or take one or two.  I don't think this is bad but enemies don't respawn so other than retracing steps to get some older quest complete or a secret dug up, there is little reason to go back to old areas of the map already explored.Points Breakdown:Combat and Controls:9/10* The moving instead of attacking bug/glitch gets annoying so I took a point away here.Graphics:7/10* Nothing Stellar but still good none the less.Sound:9/10*Fantastic Sound track and decent voice acting.Difficulty:9/10*Set it to easy, normal, or hard.  No hand holding!Story:9/10*Well designed from the start.  You begin not knowing much other than that you are a source hunter. "

												let me preface this review by saying that this is one of the best games that i have had the pleasure of playing, period.you start by making a character. this is the most dissapointing part of the game since there are few options to customize your characters. you also must chose their classes. this is the hardest part of the game because if you chose two classes that dont work well together than you are completely and utterly screwed. now that thats out of the way lets do pros and cons :DCONS:- trial and error when creating and choosing classes- the difficulty may be off-putting to some people- if you want cool armor for your melee character then you have to choose a male, the female armor pales in comparison- lots of reading (not a con for me but it might bother some people)PROS:- a large world- LOOT- character progression that could be compared to dark souls - turn based combat (unless thats not you're thing)- modding - inspired art styleworth a buy for the current price. i might have to make another steam account just so i can buy it a second time#GOTY #BUCKETHELMETS #STEAMDOESNTDOHASHTAGS #THATLASTONEMIGHTHAVEBEENABITLONG #IF THIS GAME WERE  A PERSON I WOULD BE JEALOUS OF THAT PERSON #FINDTHEODDONEOUT #TOOMANYHASHTAGS #IHATEMYSELF "

												Long have I searched for an RPG that captures the nostalgic feelings of Baldur's Gate that innovates and improves with modern technology and game design. My search has ended.Divinity: Original Sin provides a compelling atmosphere with a lengthy list of party customization that allows you to build an effective party based on your own, personal whims. Want a caster who can also get up in to melee range and go to town? Done. Want a ranger that casts spells alongside her arrows? Done. All you need to do is learn some of the basics and figure out what abilities will complement one another and you're good to go.On that note: This game is not (typically) easy. Be prepared to save and load games frequently! The tides of battle can and often are easily decided on your tactical decisions, and sometimes incapacitating an enemy at a crucial moment really does mean all the difference.The game also allows you to build two very different characters in terms of personality. Your characters can have conversations with one another and your choices during these conversations will help shape how that character is at their core. If all that wasn't enough to interest you, then I'd suggest looking to the company themselves. They have a very clear understanding about what makes this kind of game enjoyable, and their commitment to go from KickStarter to launch proves they are willing to support this project going forward.TL;DR: If you enjoy tactical based RPG games such as old school Baldur's Gate then you'll probably really enjoy Divinity: Original Sin. If you want a game you can just blast through without much thought, you may be disappointed.			"

												In the short time of played this game I have becone addicted. A majority of my time was AFK, but non the less, it is far better then i expected. Its well written, graphics are enjoyable and feels familiar while managing to be somthing very new. I enjoy the combonations of past game types rolled into one. The turn base combat is well done, and you actually need to pay attention to story and details. It can be VERY complicated, which is a nice change of pace for people getting bored of current RPGs/MMOs. You are forced to think, and save, before every move which makes for an even more gratefying experience. Buy it with a friend or for yourself, Its well worth the money. Havent ran into any bugs as of yet, but my friend has. So far no complaints. Please enjoy :)			"

												I'll start with my summary: Yes, buy the game, it is a great, ""old school"" RPG with tons of text and little hand holding, and it's refreshing. Forget the other Divinity titles, not having them or having them is irrelevant (or, if you're a pachyderm, irrelephant.)I'll continue with my experience: I have very little other than character creation and the initial city you start in, because NO MATTER what character class combo I come up with (you have two primary characters, and can get two more before leaving the city to begin the brunt of the game) as soon as I head out- in any direction- and encounter enemies... I get party wiped.I have seen NONE of the game, because I simply don't know what I'm doing wrong. The game relies on environmental damaging and elemental attacks a lot- for instance, casting lightning or shooting a lightning arrow into a pool of water enemies are in stuns them. Great mechanic.The problem I've encountered at the start, that has prevented me from moving past the start of the game, is your turns in combat are limited to action points. Your few moves for your characters take most- or more than- those action points. Then those skills have cool downs. That means, my warrior smashes into a pack of two undead, and does decent damage to both. One gets knocked down, the other doesn't. My ranger hits four undead with a ricochet arrow. Great start to the fight. Then it's their turn. The undead next to my warrior hits him three times in the same turn for 26-35 damage each hit. Two undead archers thunk him for a shot each, and he'll either be at about 5 hps, or dead.  My other two characters may kill one more undead, or simply damage a few, but don't help much.Next turn, I *must* use a character to either heal or ressurrect the warrior. This ends that characters turn, and the warrior is revived with only a percent of health- so you have to revive him away from combat (the spell allows you to teleport them back to life in a radius). That means two characters can fight that second round. One swings at an undead, misses. Swings again, hits, its still alive. The other casts a spell that burns another twice, but doesn't kill it. Next turn, the undead archers move up, thwap my warrior dead again with arrows, nearly kill two of the other characters, and the other undead charge forward and poison them, knock them down, etc. EVEN if I live, I have to spend the entire next turn drinking a health potion or casting a ressurect spell. Every fight I've been in so far (beyond the tutorial) ends up with my characters downing health potions or casting healing spells for their turns, then getting beat on again and repeating, until I lose. I've tried not healing, but that only gets them killed a turn earlier. It has been frustrating and surprising, given how easy most games are nowadays.So, oddly enough, I like the game- it's got great visuals, it reeks of old school Baldur's Gate style gameplay, and I've read up a ton on other people's experiences, and it is indeed deep and full of exploration. I, sadly, haven't - and can't - experience it yet. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I've tried everything, but to start, once leaving the city, the game can be utterly brutal. I've never ""rage quit"" a game before this one, but I simply have put it on the back burner until I can try again someday and try something I haven't before (whatever that might be, I've tried it all. Yes- what you're thinking of suggesting? I've tried it. Yes, with a llama. And the duck.) Still, I will return- it strikes me as that good of a game. I would suggest purchasing it. You will probably not struggle like I have- others have moved on, apparently it's simply my own malfunction with this game. It's like my nemesis, and I will one day prevail.			"

												I will never understand why not more devs try to make games especially for two people. There are so many couples now you like to game together it should be obvious. This game is perfect for playing together with my husband. Hours of fun figuring out quests together, me shouting at him to watch out where he throws those spells when I stand in the frontline doing melee (90% of my deaths in this game are his fault). At its core it's your typical turn based combat rpg, but it has so many fun mechanics and layers, that it just forms a great package. If you play with a steady partner this game is a must have. If you are trying to get your partner into video games it's a good bet as well. Just make sure you don't kill them too much...			"

												Original Sin has finally been fully released and almost like a completely new game from the beta early access.  Packed with hours of gameplay, stunning environment and beautiful music, the game is truly a masterpiece. Turn-based combat and difficult boss battles call for strategising throughout the game and the combination of different environmental abilities allow for a unique RPG gaming experience. A detailed crafting system is also pretty cool too I guess. Overall an amazing game and worth the multiple delays and years of waiting for a new installment in the series. I highly recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								It mixes action or a typical exploration RPG with turn based combat. Yes I do recommend this game. I just purchased it and love it so far. I have been holding off for Pillars but lately the reviews and gameplay videos have sucked me into this, have been eyeing it for awhile now.It's sorta like - heres your world do what you want with it. As it should be.Don't buy it if you don't want to read. It definetly has some old school cRPG essence in there. Fans of rpgs..not the DS2 kind.. will like it.(DS2 is not an rpg but an action game) Top down view ..can zoom in. Good music and graphics.I have played Buldars Gate, Neverwinter Nights, PS:T,FF7/FFT all of those. Warcraft 3 took me (and guild) away from EQ 1 for a bit. I am a picky gamer. But so far I feel this has alot of potential and like what I see. Solid RPG straight up.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a gleaming reminder of what made me fall in love with RPG's over a dozen years ago. Like Fallout, Planescape and Baulder's Gate before it, it boasts a great combat system, charming characters, memorable music and a living, breathing world to adventure in. There are a few modern improvements though, like more physics-based interactions with the environment and a good amount of depth in character creation and development. My only complaints would be that in its current (beta) form, some of the animations are a bit clunky and fully voiced dialogue is extremely sparse. Those issues are soon forgotten, as the game does an excellent job of immersing you in its world. NPCs will talk to eachother often, and the game finds a great balance between witty humor and interesting banter. Your party members will speak up and comment on things, giving them life and value. Player choice affects not only the story, but how your own party members view you. Early in the game, I found myself delving in dungeons that I could have easily skipped, stealing items from a shop while using a party member to distract them, and killing people that didn't need to die just because they were rude to me. It's those kind of things that pull you in and keep you up late at night.If you like Diablo, Elder Scrolls and classics like Fallout, you will almost certainly like this game. And the fact that a game this deep has online co-op is fantastic. I could go on and on, but I've just scratched the surface and the game is calling me back. Can't wait for the full version!			"

												Good RPG for about 60-80 hours, especially since market lacks good team-based RPGs with turn, tactical combat. Humor and very well made world interaction are additional pros.Game suffer a bit from losing momentum after 2/3 and ""nerfing spree"" of devs - since small group of people on official forums constantly demands nerfs of various elements, skills, traits and mechanics (because they find game too easy, even on highest difficulty - I found it quite okay and fitting, nothing too hard and nothing ""clearing itself""), devs are mostly focused on that aspect, apparently forgetting about additional companions and other features they promised. I finished game before that happened, but if you would run into heavy reduced resistances or find something like ""glass cannon"" reducing hp by 80% instead of 50%, while giving +2 AP instead of 2x AP per turn, then you will know who to thank for that.But since I cleared the game withing ~75 hours and I dont regret playing, I dare to say that it is still good product. After all, games should be all about fun, right?			"

A good mod choice for this game would be Fourplay, so you can have up to 4 people playing together rather than only 2.			"

												This game captures the spirit of Baldurs Gate perfectly!I even would go so far and say it is better. Graphics are really good and it runs flawless on my machine. The music is not superepic but fits in nicely in all the areas.Although there is almost no voice-acting the dialogues are well written and there is plenty to explore if you are interested in the lore!Where the game REALLY shines is the tactical combat. It starts out very good and gets better and better and better.At level 10 you have so many spells and skills and every single one is usable either with the enviorment or works as a catalyst with other spells - this is the best tactical combat I have EVER experienced!I don't know how huge D:OS is. The world just invites me to explore (no quest markers, no quest compass - you have to THINK!) and I cannot remember the last time a game has hooked me in that level. After 22 hours I finished everything around the first village - and that is when the story begins!The quests have a wide reach from funny to creative to combat to explore.And the best thing : If you think of a creative way to solve quests or riddle-situations (there are a lot!) - it usually works!I did not experience a single situation in which I thought ""damn, this HAD to work now, but it didn't!""And it gets better and better : This game is actually playable in coop from start to finish! Hell, it is MEANT to be played cooperatively!In addition to the 2 main characters you can recruit 2 more heros. The downside is that these are not customizeable but there are so many options to choose from that it does not really matter, because you can branch them out any way you like anyway.There are no classes in this game, so feel free to experiment. I would even recommend to do so. For example one of my characters started out as a healer and is now a 2hand-tank-cleric-witch and extremely powerfull! This game rewards you to play a hybrid, not like other games! Even with just 1 point in witchcraft (for example) you can use a high-lvl witchcraft spell, but have to pay more action-points to use it in combat. This is just an awesome system!Every npc you meet - and sometimes enemies as well - want to trade stuff with you!If you have a rogue in your party (which I also recommend!) you will spend hours and hours to steal all the good stuff from the nice people in the towns ^^ But beware - if you get cought, you will have to fight. I would recommend loading a quicksave if that happens.Oh, and have you ever been angry about doors in other games? Or chests that you do not have a key for?In D:OS everything works as it logically should : burn down a door with mighty fire-spells, break a chest with your sword or even put a chest in your inventory for later, if you hope to find a key! That is just PURE AWESOMENESS!You can even teleport things like barrels and crates around! Block enemys with them, put an oil-barrel from your inventory next to a boss, ignite the oil and then cast a rain-spell to transform the burning field into a steamcloud followed by a lightning strike that will stun all the wet enemies at once! But beware - such a reaction can hit your party too, with your OWN spells! So always pay attention to positioning!I could go on and on and on, this game had me hooked from the start and I did not have it in my ""interesting game""-list.Check it out, play it, you won't regret it! This is VERY VERY hard competition for pillars of eternity, wasteland 2 and torment 2.I will close my review now - this is the 4th night in which I stayed up untill 6am, because the game is so great!GET-IT-NOW!

												This is CRPG done right: non-linear questing, meaningful character development, deep turn based tactical combat, a consistently interactive world, cool loot, crafting, lore, humour, etc. I cannot thank the developers enough for the commitment they had to bringing a quality modern-day successor to old-school crpgs. The game literally feels like it combined the best and most complex systems of older rpgs, and then upgraded them while adding a few original twists to them. It has the tactical combat of something like the temple of elemental evil (perhaps a bit more streamlined, but superior in depth and challenge), the interactive world of something like fallout 1 or 2 (but again, with much better implemented and more varied systems), the lore and scope of the likes of baldur's gate 2, and more than a few new ideas of its own to keep things interesting. And most importantly, everything ties in well together to form a coherent, consistent sand box of rpg experimentation. Be warned however! This game requires an insane commitment of time and attention. There are so many things to micromanage. But that is exactly what I love about it. It is not a simple matter of grinding until your numbers are high enough. It rewards patience, exploration, experimentation and careful decision making. It is entirely possible to screw yourself over completely in this game... which again, makes for an awesome role playing experience. Progress does not come swiftly or at a steady pace. There may long stretches of time when you are just trying to figure out the best way to outfit your characters. You might spend an hour navigating a house full of traps and figuring out how to get all of the loot without blowing yourself up. You might spend some time learning recipes and crafting items. You might be reloading the same battle 5-10 times. There are literally endless possibilities of both emergent and prescripted gameplay...I can only hope that Larian studios, as well as other developers, get the message and start making more games like these.

												Without a doubt, one of the most merciless, and greatest games ever. It's so content rich tha I've logged over 30 hours into the game, and haven't even progressed in the main storyline too much. The quest system is lacking, and there is little in the way of waypoints/markers on the map, but that help adds to the fun of exploring on your own, really bringing the game to life. The lack of direction makes you read all the books you find, learn the lore of the game, and most importantly, finally progress in the story. The loot amount dropped is nothing short of fantastic, as even after a smallish battle, there are several pieces of loot that make that battle worth it. Combat is turn based, which adds a new degree of difficuty to the game, like in chess, you have to think several turns ahead. I dont want to get to long in detail, but this game is worth the 40 without a doubt, 10/10, wihtout a doubt, several small bugs, but not enough to take away from the gameplay. Serioulsy, Buy it.

												let me preface this review by saying that this is one of the best games that i have had the pleasure of playing, period.you start by making a character. this is the most dissapointing part of the game since there are few options to customize your characters. you also must chose their classes. this is the hardest part of the game because if you chose two classes that dont work well together than you are completely and utterly screwed. now that thats out of the way lets do pros and cons :DCONS:- trial and error when creating and choosing classes- the difficulty may be off-putting to some people- if you want cool armor for your melee character then you have to choose a male, the female armor pales in comparison- lots of reading (not a con for me but it might bother some people)PROS:- a large world- LOOT- character progression that could be compared to dark souls - turn based combat (unless thats not you're thing)- modding - inspired art styleworth a buy for the current price. i might have to make another steam account just so i can buy it a second time#GOTY #BUCKETHELMETS #STEAMDOESNTDOHASHTAGS #THATLASTONEMIGHTHAVEBEENABITLONG #IF THIS GAME WERE  A PERSON I WOULD BE JEALOUS OF THAT PERSON #FINDTHEODDONEOUT #TOOMANYHASHTAGS #IHATEMYSELF "
