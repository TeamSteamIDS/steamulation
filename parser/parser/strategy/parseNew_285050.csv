												In 2005, developer Lionhead Studios released “The Movies”, a game that enabled you to build a movie studio from scratch and make movies.  It was a great idea, but since then, there’s been precious little that’s attempted to tackle the same subject.“Showtime!” isn’t on the same level of production as “The Movies” but it does take on the same concept.  Where as “The Movies” was all about the pretty graphics, “Showtime!” attempts to do it largely via text.  When you build a sound studio, don’t expect to actually see it; likewise, when you release a movie, you won’t be able to watch your masterpiece.Some people will already be turned off by that, because they think it sounds dull and boring.  And probably for some people it will be.  But if you’re checking out this game then you’re presumably interested in the concept, and considering there’s pretty much nothing else out there like it, I feel it’s at least worth a look just for that.You can start your career from any year, back to 1927.  As the years pass, technology will progress, which means you’ll need to upgrade your equipment, or risk producing poor quality movies.  You have to hire a script writer (or perhaps buy an existing script), hire a director and producer, as well as actors.  There are many factors that go into deciding whether you produce a turkey, or a monster global hit.The game isn’t perfect.  It’s a great concept, but it’s limited in scope, although that’s perfectly understandable considering the tiny independent developer.  There has also been bugs in the game, sometimes big ones.  But the great thing is that the developer is very eager to identify and eliminate the bugs.  For example, I reported a game breaking bug, and within 24 hours a new patch was out that fixed it.  How many developers, big or small, can honestly say something similar?Another problem with the current build is that some technologies aren’t linked to the year of movie development.  For example, you can use CGI in your movies right from 1927.  Likewise, if you wish to purchase an existing script, one category you can chose from – again, right from the start – is video game adaptions.  The developer is aware of these limitations, though, and is apparently keen to try and find ways to address these concerns, once all the bugs have been squashed.I do think it’s worth buying this game, because of the concept and because the developer is very eagerly continuing to work on it.  However, I only recommend it if you understand that the game is essentially text based and that you’re okay with that.  You should be because it's actually rather addictive!UPDATE: Those technologies that were wrongly available right from the start have already been fixed, so now no long will you be able to use CGI nor buy a script based on a video game in the 1920's.  And the bugs are rapidly getting ironed out, and I can't applaud the developer enough for his diligence.			"

tl;dr -> I made a blockbuster movie in the vein of The Avengers, turned it into a successful series, milked it for several sequels, then eventually turned it into a successful TV series when the ratings started to fall. 11/10, would play again due to realism.I got Showtime! in a bundle, and was interested in the concept - I had really enjoyed playing Game Dev Tycoon, and any other management simulator-style games. I was very satisfied with this title.If you are interested in a movie studio simulator and do not mind a lack of animations (gameplay is all text-based), then you will most likely enjoy this game. For some mindless, casual playthroughs, this is the game for you. The aesthetics are decent - since the game is entirely text-based, you will encounter numerous menus and backgrounds. When you make a movie, you have the option of selecting an ad poster from a small pool of premade templates, however, you can also load any other image you have saved on your computer. You can customize the lettering on the poster a bit, like manipulating the font and color. There is no music, so I play my own. The sounds when you click things are okay, but can get repetitive fairly quickly (I turned all audio off after about 2 hours). You will use the mouse to click on different buttons and menus, and the tutorial is very helpful at showing you everything you can do in the game. The learning curve is mostly minimal to (maybe) moderate, depending on your experience with management simulators. You can adjust the difficulty accordingly by changing how much money you start with and/or what year you start in (more modern years give access to the latest cinema technology).Gameplay consists of you making movies and conducting research to give you access to the latest technology. When you make your first movie, you will have the option of customizing the scripts you'd like to use (or, you can buy scripts offered by hopeful prospects). You may change the themes you'd like in your movie, and this part is very interesting, because it will affect the target demographic, and is also sensitive to the time period you are currently in. For example, lots of adult themes and profanity will most likely give you a 18+ (or higher) rating, and lots of violence will be very, very controversial if done in the early 1950's. You will need to fill your movie with actors, actresses, supporters, directors, and producers. You can hire accordingly, or you can sign contracts with people if you want them to be exclusively yours (for a time). The contracts will expire after x movies have been made with the individual, or after x years (whichever comes first) - higher values will cost you more money. If you are careful and experiment, you will realize that signing contracts is much more cost-efficient in the long run, but ONLY if you are intending to repeatedly use the individual(s). As your movie is being made, you can invest your networth in things like better sound stages, more advanced technology (you will have to keep up as new technologies arise with time, or lose market share to your competition), and better working conditions. The game plays a lot like Game Dev Tycoon, where you can select from a large number of movie genres (as well as sub-genres if you desire). From here, you will have to do a bit of matchmaking, as different individuals are more proficient at certain genres, and certain themes are better fit (for example, you won't necessarily want a lot of violence in a family film). Balancing these different elements will help you get better ratings, which lead to more viewers, and also more revenue. Pretty frequently, you will be invited to attend various award shows, however, you do not have to attend (it can be a waste of time if you know with certainty that you won't be nominated). Getting awards bolsters your studio rating, and higher studio ratings allow you to hit a larger target market. Although your playthrough can get very repetitive very quickly, it is still worth giving this game a try if you are the least bit interested in movie studio management. The gameplay is very casual and not at all demanding, so it plays well for a time-filler, or as a break from your more intense games.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												The game maker has been working hard on eliminating game bugs and making the game more enjoyable and I do believe that the game is getting better by the update, it is now much easier to understand how to make a movie that will bring in $20-30 million to get going.I think the biggest downside is that it costs a lot of money to improve sound and film, $150 million to update film and sound technology each is way too high and it may take ages to raise that kind of cash to update and compete.

												10/10Buy it or I WILL personally fund The Matrix 4 and ANOTHER Die Hard film...you HAVE BEEN WARNED!!In a sentence,  this is to Red Carpet Chic what Game Dev Tycoon is to Geek Chic....in other words, if you love movies and always wanted to play the cigar-chomping studio boss....it's your lucky day.Many people have made the obvious reference to 'The Movies' in their reviews of this game, and whilst that's a fair comparison I have to say that simply saying, 'it's like The Movies but without graphics' is slightly missing the point...imho!!It's like the movies but without all the irritating running around and time-wasting.You can take your sweeeeeeet time in this game, pondering over the exact cast / dir / prod for your film, the genre/sub-genre to choose and even what to call your new cellulose masterpiece...or you can just jump in and make some films. The former WILL garner better results BUT the latter is great fun and, on the easier settings, will still produce some great results.Whilst the game DOES lack a little depth, it does possess a lot of charm and replayability...it has that undescribable, 'just...one...more...turn' that Game Dev Tycoon is probably the best exponent of in this type of game.

												----- UPDATED -----I've felt it was due time for a quick update on my review of Showtime!, as my previous one started with a sentence that no longer makes sense, as nearly 30hours of gameplay should be suffice to have a great idea of what the game is like.As you can easily guess, you don't play 30 hours of something if you don't like it, and this is not exception. I really like the game. Not only because I'm a big tycoon games fan, but because I've always loved text-based games, which is a strong point with Showtime!'s developer.Despite having released the game quite some time ago, the developer still keeps pumping out the occasional update, and he's EXTREMELY active around the forums. I've personally e-mailed him offering my help with whatever I can be helpful with for Showtime!'s sequel. I can only imagine what he'd be able to do with a team and a bigger budget at his disposal.Everything from my previous review is still true, and the only thing I'd probably add up is that I really recommend this game for any movie and/or tycoon lovers.----- Review from 20th January 2015 -----Don't judge this review based on my playtime, I just got the game on steam.I've been a ""follower"" of this developer and his games, and I really enjoy what he has to offer.If like simulators, if you like movies, if you like text-based (despite having images, it's pretty much text-based) games, this is all of that, and much more.Unfortunately the game doesn't have the real names, like its demo does, due to copyright stuff, and we can all understand that, being the company small and what not, but that doesn't take the fun away.The price can seem a bit pushy, I agree, I suggest waiting for a sale, or if my previews statements convinced you, and you are really the kind of gamer that likes simulators like this one, then go for it!PS. I really wish Myrtilus Entertainment would get a new and improved version of ""Bestseller"" on steam, really love that one. And while at it, Chart Wars, too! ;)			"

												Edited:I would most certainly recommend this game to everyone who likes management simulators. If you ever wished you could make a movie, it's your time to shine. This game is highly addictive, once you start you just don't want to stop. I highly recommend to anyone who buys this game to visit the official site, where you even can find mods for Showtime!, in which you can download real life actors, producers, directors for your game, so there are infinite number of projects to try out here, if you are a real fan of films. The game even gives you Editor tool, which is really easy to use, (usually as someone who just likes to play and not get behind how everything work, I can't find a thing in most editors) so even if you can't find your favourite actor, actress (or you wish they would be) you can very easily import them.In short, highly enjoyable and addictive game, it's price truly worth the money and the game devs actually listen to you (that's why I edited my first comment, so you can see it) and updates come out regularly. I can honestly say, this game was the best buy I made on Steam in a long time. Just don't start this game the day before one of your exams :DIt can be quite enjoyable, but after a while it gets very frustrating, mainly becouse of the screenwriting, which is just a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ becouse if you want to have a good one you just have to reselect every single month the ""Script revision"" till you get 5 stars everywhere. Now after I paused the game and went to do something else I just don't want to return to it, for this reason only. Otherwise, the director, actor, producer management is quite good and the poster feature is a nice touch too, so it really has potential and can be enjoyable, but the script writing part is really bad. I get it, why you can do it, but it completely ruins the experience, so while it stays the same I can recommend it only for the most obsessed movie-suckers. If the screenwriting part would be changed, I am sure I would just spend all day playing with this game, becouse every other part of it's just awesome for a person who loves movies as much as I do.

												Fun, addictive, cynical movie production simulator!It's quite a simple process - you pick name, genre, subgenre and themes for your film.  Then you pick writers, actors, directors and producers to create it for you, based on their experience, talents and fees.  Then you find out how it did!  Did the public like it?  Did the critics like it?  Did it make you money?  Then you make the cynical choices like producing 10 sequels to your terrible action movie series in order to fund your serious movies.Don't expect this to be like The Movies, where you actually get to see any of your film animated.  You also don't have floor plans and rooms to manage, it's not that kind of sim.  Take a look at the screenshots - that's pretty much what you're getting.It looks simple, but it's a lot of fun!			"

												After looking at the screenshots, I knew that this game was my type of game. Manage something fun and be creative at the same time? Awesome. The reviews, however, were pretty shocking. ""Mixed"" doesn't even cover the polar-opposite reviews. So, I threw the game in my wishlist and waited for a sale. I picked it up for $.59, and to be honest, I would have paid $15-20 for the game had I known how good it is. The dev seems to have put a whole lot of effort into fixing what didn't work and adding features that make the game memorable. Last night, I lost 5 hrs when I sat down to just ""play for a second"". It's that fun! It might be slow in the beginning, when you don't have much money for movies... but within one year, it picks up pace.I highly recommend this game. I never review anything, and I'm reviewing this because it deserves positive reviews now.			"

												Nice little have your own movie studio game. I would recommend this game for those who like the genre. Being able to manually customize your posters for the movies your studio creates makes this game stand out from all the other similar games. Since there's a movie genre ""Erotic"", I make adult XXX movies ...

												[Edit] The developer responded and there's also a recent update to the game so I'm changing my review while still being as honest as possible.1. No resolution options, it's windowed mode and just takes up a tiny part of a 1920x1080 screen.[edit] There is now a fullscreen option but the game is still locked to 4:3 ratio.2. No matter what time period you choose, it still talks about internet and social media buzz.[edit] Dev response: ""That shouldnt be the case. I've deliberately made most of the news events decade-specific so you dont get those sort of news items. A couple might have been missed so for that I apologise- let me know what they say and I can fix them easily.""3. Not enough feedback to base decisions on. I made a movie with top notch talent, rewrote the script to make sure the story was great, had 100% star quality, but the movie still bombed.[edit] I'm still not sure why the movie bombed, other than the fact that I only had 12mil left for the marketing budget and the recommendation was 22mil, which was double what the movie cost to make.4. When you make a movie, you're locked into your choices and then whatever you have left over you can use for marketing. But marketing is 2x-3x more than the movie cost to make! I don't think that's how it works, but I could be wrong![edit] I still see this as an issue. The game doesn't tell you what goes into the recommended marketing budget, so it's almost impossible to tell how much money you'll need to set aside after production costs.I'm super impressed by the developer taking time to address my points, and also still supporting this game over a year after release. I think this game would be fun for people who enjoy tycoon type games, or who are fascinated by the business side of movie making.Ever play The Sims 2, 3, or 4? You know how on that game you can write a novel or something, pick a genre, give it a name, and then send it off and start receiving royalty payments? Imagine a game based around that idea, except you're making movies instead, and you have a lot more decisions you can make. That's what this game is like.I'm changing my review to a thumbs up because I can tell this game is made with heart by a passionate, responsive developer, and that's too rare these days.			"

												I struggled with buying this game because of the negative reviews that I read.  When it went on sale, I really didn't think I could go wrong with buying it.  I was right.  It's a fun management sim, but it isn't flashy.  After awhile, you're making money so fast that there really isn't a challenge to the game anymore.It seems to me that the awards logic is completely random and not based on anything.  At one point in the game, I had the 5 highest grossing, critically-acclaimed films of the year, yet I did not receive a single award at any of the ceremonies.  A little hokey, I think.If you can score this title on sale, like I did, I thing you'll get a good 10 -12 hours out of it.  Not sure I'd spend the money for a full price download though.			"

												Very easy to pick up and play. It isn't very flashy, but if you like simulator tycoon games, you'll probably enjoy this one. I have a save on medium and the game might be a little too easy, so I'd suggest cranking it up to hard. Additionally the game takes a little too long to change each time (I've played for 72 hours and I'm still not to the point where there are home video releases or CGI). But I've had a lot of fun with this game and it's great for just having something to tinker with for a few minutes here or there in the background.			"

												Not a very fun game. Its basically a spreadsheet/database simulator. You can put together movies & such using a huge list of Actors, producers, directors & such, none of which have any personality beyond having a name and a pricetag. The secret to success in this game seems to be spend as much money as you can on the cast & crew... you will have a hit movie every time so long as you sort candidates by cost & pick whoever appears at the top of the list. And it will be exactly the same every time.			"

												If you want a fun casual game that has potential to grow and is growing (the devs update once in a while) than this is the game you want. (If you can get past the 'tutorial' because I didn't, the first time, that is)The idea of your own movie studio is cool and original(?), but the actual game is.... complicated.So everything is text-based, fair enough but still the game has a high price, IF you want to buy this game full price, please don't do it. Get it in a bundle like me, e.g. from IndieGala. The game looks ok and it has real potential, but it doesn't live up to it. The tutorial, well it doesn't do what a tutorial should. I'm now kinda stuck (in my first save file) and I don't know what steps I should take for my first film, no overview of steps you need to take for a film, no explanation why you should or shouldn't get the most expensive writer etc. Another example is the fact that you first fill in the space of what your first movie title should be and a descpription and later tells you that 'action' movies are popular, but if you change the title or description of your movie then you get 10% less hype of you film....Please don't get me wrong, just because I find it 'not soo good' doesn't mean it sucks [blank] because I didn't play for very long. Even if the game is kinda overpriced right now doesn't mean that the devs just leave it like this, they update once in a while and listen to feedback. (A lot of people can learn from this)			"

												The game has some bugs, but I recommended to try it. Here are some bugs and recommendations:When you start game and accidentally set 0 starting money - game crashes.Every time it asks if you want to enable SFX effects - no need to ask every time when you start the game.I cant find information what type of images I can import.Short plot of the movies is really short and the room should be extendedWhen you select writer or every other menu with columns - you should be able to sort them by salary, name or other. You can filter them by stars in the middle, but its not enough. I really like market distribution section :)The ""tutorial lady"" hide very large part of the screen. It could be a good idea to move her dialog in some corner without valuable information.Is there any option for a full screen?Tutorial needs to be reviewed. For example: sometimes it says you need to hit backarrow, when you actually need to hit Finish button.There is no basic information what are the pros and cons on various decisions. For example - what is the difference between releasing the movie worldwide or limited... only audience or?For some reason, for me instead of name of the month (below date) I see only ?????? maybe it has something with local language.

												In Showtime!, you are the proud owner of a  film studio from 1927- 2010. Eventually, your studio will ascend to the point of relevance, and gradually become the top dog in Tinseltown ( if you're any good, that is). You're not on our own. Other studios will try to bring you and your upstart studio down. The rival studios release films too, and more often than not will take home the awards at the formal ceremoies in place of your films.  The managing aspect of Showtime is quite in-depth , but not in an overwelming manner by any means. There is a wide array of buildings that will enhance yor studio's turnout, for a hefty sum, in most cases, and you really do feel like you own an actual stuio.   The game is rife with parodies of modern award ceremonies and studios ( Metro Silver Slayer, anyone?) and the writing is generally to a high standard. The film making itself won't be everyone's cup of tea, unfortuantely. You hire actors, writers, directors, producers etc. to appear in your film, and this is quite in depth in itself. You create posters for the film and allocate a budget. However, you don't really have a hand in your film from there. You leave the guys to it, and they will be finished in a couple of months. Simple as that. You then wait for the money to roll in, and voila! On you go to your next film.  There is more to the system, but you get the idea. Although I don't find fault in it, I presume others might. Finally, the dev ( yes, just one) is extremely active in the community, and makes a genuine effort to listen to player's feedback. The game was released quite a while ago, yet only yesterday was another update released for the game. He really is interested in making the game the best it can be, which is more than can be said for an awful lot of other devs. He is also working on a sequel to the game, and is committed to implementing much-desired features. To summarise, the game is quite enjoyable and very resonably priced, and although your mileage may vary, this is definately worth a purchase - if you're into this kind of thing, of course! :)Verdict: 8.3/10			"

												I came into Showtime! very skeptical after reading many of the reviews but was very pleasantly surprised to find an approachable and fun game with simple yet addictive mechanics. If you're an old movie buff or were a big fan of the Lionhead Studios game The Movies, than I think you will find a lot to like here.In the game, you are the head of your own movie studio. You can pick a starting date from 1927 up to 2013. As time passes bigger and better film and sound technology will become available to you but not always when you would expect it to (more about that later). You may choose the huge expense of upgrading to get the best possible quality for your movies or hang on to that outdated equipment to save a buck. You have a choice of buying existing scripts or hiring writers of various quality (indicated by star ranks and letter grades) to write original first drafts. Once written, scripts are rated for various categories such as pace, story arc, and characterization among others. The quality and experience of the writers in general as well as their ratings in these specific categories effects the quality of the script overall and for those categories. If you don't like the quality ratings of the script within a category or categoriesthen you can hire another writer to (preferably with better ratings than the one you hired before - at least for the problem categories) do a revision, a partial rewrite, or a total rewrite. Keep in mind, all of these take additional time. Once a script is ready, hire directors, actors (leading and supporting), and producers as needed. You may negotiate their contracts to help save money by tweaking the amount of up-front cash they receive and whether they get any percentage points of the gross film take. Actors can be assigned to direct or produce, directors to produce, and producers to direct all for the same salary to save additional cash at the expense, potentially, film quality. Once everyone is assigned their roles, you assign the production budget, special FX budget, CGI budget, hire stunt men and start filming. Random events can happen at anytime during the process such as writers needing additional time, actors dying by accident, tantrums, sickness, etc.. which is a nice touch and all of them  effect your production schedule. Once filming completes, you then set your films marketing and release budget and select whether to launch globally or to a limited market. Next you pick a release date and can even give your movie a custom movie poster from image files on your computer - which is a nice touch for those of us who like to REALLY get into a game and do a little RPG'ing. There is also a 7% revenue increase for movies with custom posters to act as an incentive to actually put one together, although I suppose you COULD use any old crummy image from your desktop instead of going through the bother of putting together mock movie posters(which is what I've been doing). After you launch, you either start raking in the dough or you start packing up for skid row. I'm glossing over the details for the sake of this review but there are a lot of variables that can effect the quality of your movie and the reception to it by the viewers.Where Lionhead's The Movies was very graphics oriented, Showtime! is very text driven. There are very few visuals and only a few basic sounds - not even background music as of now but what is there is enough to make the game compelling and addictive. There is more depth in the movie production process with Showtime! over Lionhead's The Movies which was much more about putting together actual 3D movies. The developer for Showtime! has gone the extra distance to put in some nice features such as the ability to pick custom movie posters for each of your movies, the ability to create movie sequels and start a film series complete with devoted fans - you can even sell the rights to a movie series if your studio is short of cash, long-term contract deals with talent, a movie hall of fame, and internal game achievements (although why this hasn't been worked into Steam achievements is beyond me - maybe down the road?).There are bugs and some odd time-period/linearity problems such as CGI being available in 1927 but the developer is very active with his community and seems to be right on top of getting our feedback and working it into regular updates along with all of the bug fixing. I do highly recommend this game if you're a fan of quirky mostly text-based games or old movies! It's very much worth the price and the developer is definitely continuing to work on improving it.

												This is one of the best casual games that I have played on Steam. It reminds me slightly of The Movies, by Lionhead Studios, which came out in the mid-2000's. It is a much simpler game than The Movies, but it still is fun in its own right. In addition, the developer of this game has released frequent updates over the course of the last year, improving the base game in multiple ways. It's not a game from a high-budget studio, and it's not perfect, but it is certainly worth the price and it will provide hours of fun for those who enjoy strategy-based games based on movies.			"

												My erotical musical ""♥♥♥♥♥song 2:♥♥♥♥♥♥Choir"" just won best director, screenplay and actress, while my artsy documentary ""The Narcissist Philantrope"" had it out with my other artsy documentary ""Haggard Housewife"" for all the technical awards. My Grimdark Fantasy series ""Grim Valley"" ruled the box office. Then the game crashed.I loved coming up with new ideas for movies and probably spent just as much time finding the perfect picture for the posters online as I did on actually playing it. It's extremely addictive and a lot of fun until you figure out that money fixes everything, but in my opinion the game is more like the groundwork for a sequel that could be truly great. More depth, more stability and more variables coming into play for achieving success and this would be absolute genius. "

												2nd Edit:This game is showing great promise, the developer is working very hard on fixing the game. I admit I've had some issues with it since my purchase, but I've not been regretting buying this game.The few hours I've played the game so far, It's been very fun and very addicting.I've had several crashes, which at the beginning gave this game a red hand from me, not because I didn't enjoy it, but because that it crashes every so often.The developer have within the span of a few hours, released 3 bug fixing patches, fixing at the present moment, all the issues I had.There may still be some bugs around, but with such a dedicated developer, I'm convinced that those will be fixed as well, within a timeframe that makes many other, and much bigger companies ashamed.Now for the actual game review.I've for a while been looking for a casual game, that could provide some new challenges in the simulation department.I've played Game Dev Tycoon for quite a bit, and been looking around for something similar, a tycoon type of gameThis game aren't quite up there yet, but it got the potential.The game is fun, and very addicting, and simple, yet challenging.For 8 euro's, this game is a little worthy gem.

												I had fun playing it, and for the price, I still recommend it. Even though, after playing quite a while, and seeing ""It came from France!"" establish itself as a popular franchise, the game hit a runtime error and dropped out, costing me all I'd done this session. EDIT - there have been updates and it seems more stable...The gameplay is fairly repetitive and some things - like how many roles there are in a series - don't carry over from one iteration to another in a franchise.  So every movie has to be adjusted or you will release endless rated G pictures with one actor.  A randomize button, followed by customization, would have been nice.  Or default recommendations.  Some screens have incomplete information to help you make choices (like, what movie was I working on again?).  I have had fun in my first two hours, I went back and took it slower next time, and it crashed again.  I'm back again for a third time and having more luck.  Save often, or you'll need to reboot every franchise you make, but there aren't many games I've gone back to this many times.  So thunbs up - if you like the topic, try this game.			"

Everything is easy to do, and find, I've experienced no bugs, and while I would like more titles for films in built, at least you can add your own!Oh, and /spoiler/ sort of, if you put in an actual celebrities name (Christopher Nolan for example), their picture is also in built!

While you don't actually get to watch your masterpieces (or flops) there's still plenty of fun in producing your own creations, using your own pictures as movie posters, selecting the cast, reading the different reviews of your films, competing with other studios to be top dawg, and much more.

												Okay, so this game can be really buggy. And if you're expecting something like Lionhead's ""The Movies,"" you're going to be disappointed. It's pretty much a text-based sim. It really reminds me of Extreme Warfare Revenge, the wrestling promotion game.First, the bad stuff:The interface is TERRIBLE and fairly unintuitive.Sometimes you have to click (+) or (-) buttons or use a slider instead of just typing in the value you want.The game will occasionally crash, so make sure to save.Speaking of, after you select a save slot, the game will tell you that autosave is now enabled. It isn't. Go to the options and enable it manually. Oh, and you have to make your first save manually before you can do that.Then the good stuff:It's just fun, and fairly addictive. Once you get the winning method down for producing movies, it's not a hard game.I released a series of big-budget action flicks that made me BILLIONS of dollars. Then I produced a horror movie based on Gulliver's Travels.All in all, despite its flaws, I'd still recommend this game.			"

												Overall I think this is a good game and I have enjoyed playing it.  Be forewarned this is a text based game, so if you are looking for great graphics or sound effects, this is not the right game for you.  There's an editor included where you can add anyone you want to the database (actors, actresses, writers, producers, driectors), you can also add movies to the database.  Thus far the developer has been good as far as support goes and has been active on the Steam forums (a plus).Basically you run a movie studio, develop a movie, assign folks to it and release it.  Hopefully you make enough money to continue to run your studio.  So far I have found this to be a fun game to play.  It reminds me of some of the old text based games, or one of the greydog games.

												I was just randomly looking for some cheap small games when I ran into this and it seemed interesting enough to give a try. It actually manages to be quite fun even though it looks rather unpolished and has a few bugs. The game mechanics remind me a bit of Game Dev Tycoon, it's the same kind of ""click through lots of options and wait for your product to finish and see how well it did"" stuff, except in this one it's much easier to do well, at least for me. Even if it is too easy, it's still fun to see your films do well and get awards. The bugs and sometimes weird user interface might put some people off, but it seems that the developer is actively updating the game and fixing bugs, so it will get better. I would really expect a more polished audiovisual presentation nowadays though, even from small indie developers. Still definately worth a try if movies and tycoon games interest you.			"

												The game is too simplistic and the bugs too numerous to give this a serious recommendation. It was fun while it worked, but it lacks any kind of depth that would lead to meaningful gameplay. I wish tmy choices meant a little bit more. It seems that when you are making a movie it just comes down to the numbers you assigned to the movie. Generating a 5* script and tossing a big budget at a movie are both simple to do, and my experience, always lead to a profit. Game is as simple as clicking the button to re-write a script until it hits 5* (takes a few re-writes, but this is absolutely not something that is difficult to accomplish) and then tossing a giant budget at it. It's a simple as that.There are also tons of bugs. Save often. My best advice is save often and toss big numbers at your movies.			"

												Running a film studio is good subject for a game but this one needs some more development before it's really good.  There are too many options available to the player at the beginning of the game and the tutorial only covers the basics.  You can start your studio as early as 1927 and the game has historically accurate film and sound systems that became available as time passes.  Unfortunately the rest of the game does not reflect the times and allows you to develop scripts that contain violence, nudity and other things that would not have been allowed in Hollywood at the time under the Hayes code.The game allows you to hire specific actors, directors and producers but other production staff such as cinematographers and composers are not covered in the same detail.  The people are all ficticious, no doubt for legal reasons, so if you want real names in your game you will have to add them yourself using the editor.Potentially, this could be a good game but it needs more polish.

How you can edit your star list etc. Pick a writer and genre. Its all there from previous movie studio tycoon games done much much better. This is focused on making the best script and match itr withe matching director and actors. The rest is sheer gamble. Just as it should be. I wish thoughtthe bugs in the awards section of the editor launch was fixed with an new update. Alsoe for an update or a sequel would be nice if you cloud pick the whole gang from writer to casting to art director and cinematographer. Expand the demand and a bit of a fix to the poster maker. Other wise its a super fun game that I will keep player until I get feed up witch wont happen anytime soon.			"

												Showtime! is a simple, straightforward game. You manage your own movie studio. This means creating film budgets, releasing your films at the perfect time, and on occasion, dealing with rival studios. Unforseen events may even halt the production of your movie.My complaint about the game would be it is too simple. For example, You can hire actors but outside of Lead Roles and Supporting Roles, you can't specify what characters they play. (It should be noted the developer is making a sequel and has changed this).Overall Showtime is fun, and addicting. You sit down with the thought of playing for a few minutes and end up an hour later looking at the clock realizing you got lost in the movie making process.			"

Secondly it reuires that you also be a little creative if you really want to get the most out of it.  If you have those two things and love business simulations and such this is a great game.  The best thing about this game is that the developer is always trying to improve it.  And I might add he improves it more often then any developer out there that i have seen.    I highly reccomend this game but lease understand this isnt the type of game where you are going to have tons of actions.  this is a game about creating movies, a game about dollars and sense a game about making a profit and improving your movie studio.

												Text based (mostly) game that goes a little deeper than you first realize. I didn't realize I had some additional control over the script (content) and re-rights. Budget stuff is a little confusing, never seems like the game wants you to spend much on the movie but always wants you to spend a ton on marketing. Get a bit repetative and the monthly costs (in game) get a little out of control. You figure out the formula pretty quickly and then suddenly get that huge release that pretty much sets you up from there. Worth the few bucks I spent on it, but I don't know how often I'll go back to it. Could use some more work on the interface, making things more clear and having information handy whe you want it.

While this isn't the most popular genre of games, if you have any interest or enjoyment for that type of game i would definatly recomnded this title.  "

												This is a Absolutely Great Casual Movie-Studio-Running Simulation!Lets get off to the basics first.. it is a text based simulation strategy game. If, you are not into that and do not enjoy those type of games then I suggest you not buy it. But, if you are perhaps like Me and Love these type(s) of games. Then, I can tell you it will be the best $8.00 you ever spent. It provided Me countless hours of entertainment.. and, sadly. Steam does not log my offline hours. If, it did it would be one of my most played games. Did I mention this game is HARD?! I managed to get the best film of my career in the game and made roughly around 250 / 450 million on one film. Sadly, the next film I made TANKED.. and, I spent a GOOD amount of the money I made on that one movie in making this one. So, my advice to you is do not put all your eggs in one basket when making a movie in this game.. Try and Save your money for as long as you can. Or, it will be Game Over Fast.Secondly, The Developer of this game is Extremely Nice. And, VERY ACTIVE.. He responds to Most if, not ALL Suggestions and Problems with the Game on the Forums.. and, He also fixes them VERY Quickly. Every other day I login this Game is updating.. if, that says anything! :-)So, Here are my Scores!Gameplay: 9/10Audio 7/10 Graphics: 8/10Replayability: 10/10Overall: 9.0 out of 10.  BUY IT! :D "

												This game seems interesting to anyone that like film, actors and actresses, and directors. Unfortunately, it isn't for the faint of heart. It can be somewhat weird in that the computer player seems to win all sorts of awards for films, while the player isn't even a ""runner-up"" in any category. There isn't really a way to know what sort of film genre would be popular at any given time, which actors, actresses, directors, and producers work well together, or even what sort of stage or camera equipment is best. I found myself quickly becoming broke, falling into bankruptcy and in need of loans, and if there was an end in sight I couldn't guess how to get there. When you prepare a film for distribution... good luck. I had to ask other players, ""What do I do to release the film to the public?"" This is by no means intuitive. Overall, I will be generous by giving this a ranking at 2 out of 5 Stars.			"

												I want to recommend this game. It's simple, fun and a decent sim, but for such a simple game, it freezes. A lot. Sometimes when I have to switch screens and do something else. Sometimes when I'm in the middle of an action in the game. Usually when it's a few years in and not always at a good point during the autosave. If this was a complicated action game and it started choking on me, I suppose I wouldn't be writing this, but it's basically a text game running on a 3 year old gaming computer. At this point I've had it freeze on me three times during play just today. I just can't recommend it to anyone and I seriously hope the developer gives a good hard look at how they're handling the data the game is using.			"

												This game has a very hard learning curve and can be very stressful to understand on your first play through even if you were doing sandbox mode. However, overtime this game becomes extremely addicting and is well worth it's price tag. In short, I can describe the game in three vital areas:- Building, maintenance, and development of a studio and facilities that contribute to your publicity and production - Very detailed 6-phase production of a movie (can work on 6 movies at a time, though it is very difficult to do so if you're trying to make 6 star quality screenplay) Script-writing phase, casting (Even the Producers and Directors you choose matter) , production, marketing, and release.- After all of your production work, then it comes to release. How did the audience like it, critics, did it make or lose money, where did you open it, what was the appeal? Then there is several award ceremonies that occur over the course of the year (this game is turn-based on a monthly scale) and your movie winning an award can increase home release sales if you choose to market it - adds prestige to your studio - and you can create a filmseries that makes even more money as you attract a fanbase to that series. Huge emphasis on this point, it's very fulfilling too after all of your hard work Overall, this is a very addicting turn-based-tycoon-style game that really makes you feel involved in the Entertainment Industry.

												Meh.If you are competent, this game is way too easy.  As long as you're conservative advertising your first three or four movies, and don't build much in the way of facilities until you have spare cash, you're golden.  Rewrite till the script is perfect, cast decent actors, watch money roll in.  (Also helps to use your own plots, rather than buying adaptations.)   Starting in 1950 with $25 million, at the hardest setting, I maxed out every film studio aspect possible and amassed over $2 billion in less than five years game time, with 10 films in various degrees of completion.It wasn't even necessary to pay attention to what kind of movie I made or what time of year I released it.  I made over $270 million on two documentaries, for God's sake.  Sequels are seemingly impossible to lose money on.  (I assume you have to cast at least one of the original stars; I never tried recasting everyone.)  I changed genres in sequels without alienating the audience.  My LEAST successful film--my first--still made $17.5 million.  Of course, it may be that I was born to run a film studio, but I have my doubts. Also, a design bug:  If you put people under contract, you only have to pay them once for up to 8 movies, and then they do all the movies for free.  That doesn't SEEM likely.  And it is hardly necessary to make money in the game.I like this sort of game, and the designer is still working to improve it, so I will give it the most grudging of thumb's up.			"

												The year was 1927. When my father died, i was left with a 25 million dollar inheritance. I was told by so many that I as set for life. But no! I couldnt stand idly by as just another rich man! The movies were the place for me! So I started my own company, Fattened Cow Films as it was called. My very first film was ""The Dusty Trail"", It was my dream to make this movie. And obviously being as rich as I was expenses were no bother to me so Money was flowing and what a joyous sight it was! But Alas! before I was done making my movie, I looked at my bank account to see that I was -500 thousand in the red. But I had not even the money to cover the marketing, no I was far from complete! But to my chagrin I could only stand idly by and watch as My film flopped and now I trudge the streets of the poor begging for the alms that fall from the purses of gentlemen.10/10 would go bankrupt again.

												Just bought this game, and played 4 hours straight building up my first studio, until a bug on one of my film releases meant I couldnt close it to continue, had to close the game. When I went to load it back up again I found no saved game as it does not have an autosave feature. Money down the drain, can not be bothered to start another one! Developer needs to add auto-save feature and fix that bug, either way I probably won't be playing it again. It's a shame I was having fun until that point.EDIT! There is an auto-save, however you need to manually save it first, found this out after giving the game a second chance, since then I am now enjoying the game knowing if there are any more bugs at least my game is saved.Recommend for decent tycoon game, one thing I hope the developer does in the future, is update the UI so when you are upgrading your studio you can actually see the grounds and the inside upgrading with the times, this will allow for even more extra upgrades for cosmetics and a place to spend your millions lol!

												Well, this is a huge disappointment.I hoped to get something like 'The Movies', a game I enjoyed playing again and again, and which I had to reinstall now (and  I regret nothing!) :)However, the game play is...frankly... unreachable.Sitting in front of an 4k Monitor, I first had to reset the font size to 100% to even see the start game button, and could not read anything after that. Luckily, after some time, I hit the steam Icon by accident, so Steam got started. This game, however, does not scale at all. There's a Window in the middle of my screen, considerably smaller than a CD Jewel case, which might or might not contain the game - I couldn't tell. And I thought scaling a window was something that pretty much every programmer in the world solved around the late 90's.Folks, if you want to write a game, and sell it, like 'professionals', use a professional framework that takes care of it or at least! seperate the rendering logic and make a quick call to determine dpi scaling support. Scaling can than be achieved via SetProcessDPIAware (from Winuser.h) or in Java by using JavaFX. If you don't know what that means, you're not ready to sell your game. If your framework does not support that, you'll need to change your framework (seriously). If that sounds like too much work, you're not ready to sell your game. Really? Really. Sorry.So, what's the final verdict? I have a severe head ache now, and my eyes hurt. After trying to plax the game for 4 minutes. Last game that did that was the unfathomably bad X Rebirth (for different reasons, though. And to be fair, this game was € 61 cheaper). However, I still look forward to trying this game if it ever gets a working screen renderer.PS: So I had to start it again, since appearently you cannot write a review if you've used a game for less than 5 minutes (dumbest rule ever? Game doesn't start - never tell anybody). After another minute, I can verify that this game responds rather well to alt+f4. So thats a plus. "

												This game has never worked for me. When I go to make a movie, it says error 331, and shuts down. It needs a professional programmers help. He needs to pay for a programmer that is a veteran to look at his code and fix this game asap. His error catching is HORRIBLE. As a systems analyst myself, I would add that he needs someone that is an expert in error catching. I really think this game has potential. But as it stands it is NON-FUNCTIONAL.			"

												This game is similar to movie mogul although doesnt go into as much depth. Nonetheless, it is fun for a while and can be modded to allow extra longevity. The UI could do with an update and allow mouse scrolling of talent etc to speed things up and there should also be an option when doing a sequel to automatically choose the previous actors if you so wish instead of finding them all manually.

												My Review: 8/10This game is certainly not for everybody. That said however, I think this is an amazing game. It allows for creativity and is a great simulation game. The game isn't very difficult, but you can make it more difficult by trying out new directors and actors, and only giving your low budget films a limited release (just like real life), or take risks with your new films!  All in all, the more you put into this game the more you will get out of it. Good, solid, film sim game.			"

												SHOWTIME is one of those games that you can easily get into without a lot tutorials.  It's simplicity allows a lot replayability.  And you get your money's worth.  There are better games out there, THE MOVIES, but that is nearly 10 years old, and has lacked support.  It also bogs down as it tries to do too many things.  SHOWTIME on the other hand let's you run a studio and make films using siple controls.  The decisions seem to make some effect on the game, yet I was surprised that one of my sequels made a gazzilion dollars.  I would like to see the following features:  Being able to start in 1920 with silent pictures and a smaller studio system, having verticle integration (i.e., buying, running and owning distribution channels AND theater chains), and being able to choose a HOME city and territory.  Some things though seem to make little difference.  The city chose to make a film or some of the film or sound quality do not make much difference.  It would be great to automatically retain case and director on a re-make/sequel. Also would be great to see how many films a particular actor has been in (one actor I used was a low level actor, after the first film he jumped to A-List status demanding 30+ million dollars, so I assume he also made other films, since mine was a mediocre success).  Other than that I think overall the game is worth it.  You will probably burn out after 2-3 hours.  But it's a game you can come back to later.  Because of this it is within what I would classify a THUMBS UP game.			"

												Even though bought for pennies this game is a let down. Little depth, little variety and tedious. I was naieve enough to fall into the trap of thinking it would be like Lionsgate ""The Movies"" but without the building aspect and how dismally wrong I was. We all make purchase mistakes and this is mine.** Edit ** My apologies for the comparison to The Movies game. This was obviously not going to be a AAA big budget contender to that, however from the description and the curators comments I was expecting more involvement in a variety of aspects in the industry too rather than, as others have said, getting the best actors/scriptwriters/directors and chucking a load of money at it then simply one clicking to upgrade the set or FX when you have enough cash. As the dev kindly pointed out it does not claim to be anything like the movies but I would have liked to have seen more involvement with studio aspects:*Researching & development*Innovating new tech in lighting/sound/sets/fx etcexpanding your studio to make bigger/epics etc*Actor/Producer/Director relationships*Set design/upgrades or hiring designers and setting out a brief on the films aspects that require focus for example if the film is a horror you could advise the designers to add cetain effects (fog,lightning etc) or cetain sounds or even soundtrack - modern or classical.*More interaction with crew - If only a text based game you could have conversations with scenarios that could lead to actors not wanting to work for your studio again or building a long standing freindship with directors/scrpitwriters a la Lucas/Speilberg.The concept had/has promise but is,overall, not engaging enough (for me , personally) to hold my interest for long playthroughs. I am more than happy to give it chance with the updates since last played and will add to review given time			"

												I'm a fan of these kinds of srategy sims. But I have a couple gripes that I think are easy to fix:1. This game suffers from a lack of clean step by step instructions. There is a tutorial, pop-ups, but it is timed rather than screen based. If you get ahead of the tutorial the only way to get past certain screens was to click on the pop-up which made it go away. So I ended up wasting several months in the game not knowing what to do to release a film. I recommend that there be a clear pathing for each movie so that you can click the title and it will immediately take you to the next step. That way you can't get lost. I also recommend an icon next to each movie in your queue to clearly state where they are visually instead of having to click them and read. 2. In order to set up auto-save to start you have to create a save game first. I think that's backward. It should auto-save to start in my opinion.Overall, some technical issues hold me back from recommending this game at this time. However, the dev is actively looking to improve the game so with a dev like this and a game that has almost everything you need I am willing to thumbs up this game.			"

												Decent (abet) short game. If you see it on sale and enjoy simple ""tycoon"" games, grab this - otherwise take a look elsewhere (or wait for the sale). Gameplay wise once you figure out the ""formula"" its fairly slam dunk and you can neglect the market and ride on your own coattails of good releases - expect to probably restart your game once after you figure this out so you can dominate. Only part I couldn't figure out was even with making movies that brought in the dough and were rated well by the critics, I found it hard to sweep any award shows, but didn't feel compelled to try / figure it out either.

Even Hollywood Mogul - which was the obvious inspiration to this game and is very dry to begin with - has more flavor than this one.In addition to being no fun at all Showtime offers a bad user interface and a lot of bugs, including some crashes.Avoid at all cost, even if you are a fan of the genre.

												So there I sat behind my desk as the head of Complex Melon Studios. I had started the company with a hundred million dollars and turned it into a multi-billion dollar company. I sat there smiling to myself. I was cocky, arrogant, but also humble as my many pictures of myself hung on my walls proved. I started looking over some ideas for future movies; perhaps more sequels were in order since the previous sequels of my several series had all done well. Just as I was thinking about it, my main writer burst into my office. Her name was Francis…something-or-other. I’m a busy man, I can’t be bothered to learn names.She looked me dead in the eyes and said, “Sir, I have a slight complaint, if you would be so kind as to indulge me.”I nodded and motioned for her to sit down in the chair in front of my desk and she obliged.I smiled at her and said very sweetly, “What seems to be the problem?”“It’s your movie summaries, sir, or should I say lack thereof?”“I don’t understand.”“Your movie summaries don’t make any sense. Take for example this one script you gave to me not too long ago. You titled it ‘Little Doggy Choo-Choo’ and your movie summary was simply, ‘Da fuq?'”I chuckled to myself, “Yeah, that’s because I had no idea where that title came from.”“Right,” she said, still perplexed. “But how am I supposed to write a screenplay when you haven’t given me anything? Is the dog’s name Choo-Choo? How little is he? What does he do? ‘Da fuq?’ is not very helpful.”“You’re the screenwriter, you make it up.”“Okay, but how about this one? The third movie in the ‘Deception’ series has the plot summary: ‘No one asked for it…so here you go.’ Do you actually want me to write something here?”“Of course. I gave you a title, didn’t I?”“Yeah, a pretty bad title. ‘Deception 3: Deceptiest’? There’s no such word as deceptiest.”“There is now!” I said, smiling.“I have another complaint,” she sighed.“Oh?” I asked, sitting up straight.“Yes,” she said, “Whenever I give you a script, you always give it to someone else to do slight revisions. Now I don’t necessarily have a problem with that, but, for some reason the entire script winds up being credited to this other guy even though he just did slight touch-ups and I still did basically the entire script.”“You still get paid, don’t you?”“I guess.”“Then why do you need the credit? Who cares if it’s credited to you or this other guy? Do you think people actually pay attention to who the screenwriter is?”“It would be nice to win the award for best screenplay for once, that’s all. When I see that my movie won for best screenplay, and this other guy who did barely any work on it at all is accepting the trophy, it kind of angers me a little.”“He doesn’t get paid nearly as much as you do, let him have the trophy.”She sighed and I thought I was done, but just then another screenwriter burst through my door.For the full review and the rest of the story, please visit: http://beingstephenkaplan.com/2015/01/15/its-showtime-a-video-game-review-and-a-short-story/ "

												I played this for a fair few hours to make sure I gave it a full shot. I was willing to do it because I really enjoyed The Movies! and it was on the cheap. However, I come away with what feels like a little incomplete and certainly completely imbalanced. Within 3 years of the start, I had maxxed out every building, paying full support and not worrying about it. The game tells me the era is wrong to make full nudity and sexual reference movies yet it was my highest grossing film of the preceeding movies (and by some margin).It has the basis of a decent text-based game. It needs refinement on the pace of the game, and more interacting events at the very least. Movie Stars should be hired by opposing studios. Many other little things that could make it more of a challenge.Try it again in 6 months. For less than $5.			"

												I was a big fan of the Hollywood Mogul games back in the day and was hoping that this would improve upon those. However, it felt instead like a dumbed down version of those games that didn't offer nearly the same amount of features. Hollywood Mogul 3 has now been renamed ""Hollywood Movie Studio"" and it's not available for Steam, but it was a much deeper game than this with a much better interface and it came out in 2006. I simply cannot recommend this game; the gameplay is incredibly simplistic and causes it to feel repetitive almost immediately. Furthermore, I had to change the Display settings on my computer to even get the game running.			"

												I bought it for less than 2$ and it doesn't worth more.It medium mode, this game is just too easy and boring.Turn to very difficult mode to get some fun.Game crashes frequently (under windows 10) and I couldn't get the auto-save game back :(It's a small game, fun to play on a rainy day then move to something else.

												I thought it might be similar to a game I used to love called 'The Movies' - an older Lionhead game, but boy was I wrong.Clunky, terrible UI.  More of a spreadsheet / database emulator than a game.If it wasn't that I got it part of a cheap indie bundle, I'd be asking for a refund.If you want to play a decent movie studio simulator game - look for a copy of the aforementioned 'The Movies' and avoid this like like the plague.

When trying to start a game I get Run-time error ""399""Component MSHFLXGD.OCX or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: A file missing or invalidTried uninstalling and reinstalling and validating both at least three times with no change. Finally after uninstalling and redownloading it a half a dozen times I finally was able to get it to play and was extremely disapointed, seems like it is entirely text driven with no real graphics to speak of.

												I was really hoping that this game would scratch the itch that Lionhead's ""The Movies"" started a decade ago, but Shotime! fell short.  While they take a lot of the same simulation actions into the game, they layer it under a poorly designed menu interface--it's laid out as if Game Dev Tycoon was created by people who had no concept of usability.  A bit fun, but to really become a must play, the entire interface need thrown out and rebuilt from scratch.			"

												Frankly I was a bit dissapointed. I like these kinds of games if they're done well, like Rockstar Ate My Hamster back on Amiga or Game Dev Tycoon, but after the initial enthusiasm this just felt empty and repetetive. I didn't experience the crashes some people have been reporting, but for me the game itself lacked substance. In 4 years (abt 50 turns) of game time on my first try, I had bought every possible upgrade to my studio (3D movies in the 1930's...), had several top #1 movies and more money I could use. All that was left was to keep churning script after script, rewrite after rewrite, movie after movie by doing the same few things over and over. There was nothing left to aim for except maybe if I'd wanted to chase every possible award show nomination (that don't seem to have any real effect on the game), which would've required me to do even more of this repetetive process. The idea of the game itself is pretty good, but it needs something more to have appeal that lasts longer than a few hours.			"

												This was written in Visual Basic 6. I'm not even kidding, read the patch notes, this is literally running on the VB6 runtime. For a game released in 2013.Every line of this game is self-evident crap, from dead-eyed Poser model thumbnails used for the randomly-generated ""characters"", to the bag-of-random-values simulation logic (it's common to be presented with directors over 80 years old with no experience), to the error-ridden flavor text (the plural of comedy is spelled as ""comedy's"").""Special Effects were not invented until the mid 1970s"" is an actual assertion this game makes. Apparently, previous versions of the game allowed all special effects (like ""CGI"") to be accessible from 1920 onward, and this was the only fix the developer could think of - declaring that films like ""Metropolis"", ""King Kong"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and Ray Harryhausen's entire career could never have existed.This game wouldn't make the bar for inclusion in Microsoft Plus for Windows 98.

												This is the worst game I ever played... It is full of MAJOR bugs, which is stopping you from playing the game, and the in-game tutorial is not very informative.The game also doesn't give the right mood, their is no background music what so ever, and the sounds is minimal.I can't recommend this game, due to its release with major bugs in it, and it not worth even a dollar!!

Rating: 3/10Paid: NZ$2.51 (Refunded)Review:When I purchased this game, I was hoping it was similar to The Movies. I was quite wrong.I know it's a cheap little indie game, but I found it boring. When you create a save, you are immediately put to work, coming up with a movie. You hire actors and actresses, directors and staff. Then you wait for something because you can't continue until something happens? I don't get what I'm waiting for because the game makes it confusing. At this point I decide that I'm bored, I've just wasted 10 minutes of my time and I want a refund.So I got that refund and now I'm leaving a review on this game to tell you why I wouldn't recommend it, but honestly, it's up to you what you want to do with your money. If you want to spend it on this game then I can't stop you.			"

												It is an okay game. It eventually gets really annoying having to go through all the steps to create a movie. Not gonna lie, gets pretty repetitive. I do, however, like it. I would recommend if you are really into this genre of game. Otherwise, do not get.			"

												Does anyone remember that game, ""The Movies"" by Lionhead?  Basic idea was you created a film studio from the ground up, and ran every aspect about it from the screenwriting, acting, and release.  It was pretty much a god game only instead of workign with people, you work with movies.  This game tries to do the same thing, with mixed results.  On one hand, having everything mainly be text based, makes it easy (for the most part) on your machine, but leaves what models there are, less appealing.  However, there is a big issue with this game, which is why I do not recommend it.  Around the time of this game's release I was rather harsh.I still stand by the notion that, at release, the game was broken, and barely working.  However, credit does go out to the developer, for working with the community to help resolve the bigger issues in a timely manner, and now a days the game works pretty well.  Granted, we then get into that grey area of a broken game getting released and fixed later.  However, once again, with those issues resolved we can get into the meat of the game itself.Being mostly text based, the game looks alright, with really the big issue being the placeholder models used for actors, producers, and directors.  It might be more of a personal taste, but I would have perferred no models than what is used.Even though the game becomes rather tedious after a while, that does give the player a bigger freedom to try and experiment, but with limited results.  Either dump all your money into a project, and because one thing was right it'll make every dime back, or fail miserably still makes the game difficult to fully recommend.  Yet, at the end of the day, it's a cheap simulator game, for a subject area not many games do, and isn't trying to boost its bugs as part of the game, so...plus there.  There is content in this game, and for a film buff, it's hard to not try and enjoy at least.It's more of a quick burst kind of game.  Not to expense, you load it up--which being mostly text based does make the game load and run smoothly when it works--and play for about an hour.			"

												I enjoyed the game before it got all screwed up. After formatting my Windows 8 laptop and reinstalling the game, the formatting, text boxes and everything got all whacky. I can't play the game at all. My only hope is that perhaps Showtime 2 will be coming out soon.			"

												You start off the game by creating your own movie studio , picking when you want to start for 1920 -2015 ect. Once you have done that you will be able to start production on a movie you create , or you can buy the script rights for a movie out of several catagories ( comic , stage plays, tv , video game ,novels ect) .  At first it all seems fresh and new but you start to see the same movie description / titles re used quite often. With that said thier is a fix to that and its the editor you have access to in the begining of the game where you can create actors , directors, screen writers ect. The game does resupply and auto generate new actors and directors but the game seems stale without putting your own twist on the game with creating people making the game not get boring and stale. I eventually got to this point and eneded up downloading a mod for real actors and directors which made the game exceed my expectations. I recommend this game to you if you are very detail oriented and enjoy controling every aspect of your game.			"
