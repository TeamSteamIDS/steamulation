								For $4.49 this is a challenging Tower Defense game. Easy learning curve, great graphics for the price and you can see that the developers have put real thought behind the gameplay and emerging dynamic, as it does get hard even on EASY and you need to think about what your are doing with placements.Great Game 9/10 in this price point.

												I want to like this game, but the same strategy works on nearly every map. Slow them down, hit them with the big guns. Toss in a couple lasers for airplanes. Hellfire the final wave. Rinse and repeat.Enemy variety comes in the form of airplanes or ground units. Ground units may look different, but the only real difference is how much health they have. All of the turrets are effective against all ground units, it's only a matter of concentrating the most damage into a small of a space as possible. Not all that hard since 6 of the 8 weapons hit multiple targets.This is a very vanilla tower defense game. I won't say it's bad, but it's not that great either.			"

												Defense Zone 2 is a Tower Defense game from a top down look. You have 8 towers 3 modes of difficulty and 30 maps. Does the game pull its self off well, yes. If you are new to this genre then this is a good place to start as veterans may not get the depth they want the game in all is still good.

												I played the demo version of Defense Grid. So, now it's on my wish list. I'm waiting for it to go on sale.In the mean time, I picked up Defense Zone 2. It's a fun diversion. Nice grafix, and  music.The gameplay is fairly open, and you find out sooner or later, if your stratigies will fail or not.I am new to this genre, and it is a nice balance of action and relaxation.I can see where this can be exciting/ challenging to play for all sorts of people, who no longer have the fast reflexes needed to win arcade style, scrolling shoot em' ups! Nice Job developers!			"

												I cannot recommend this game!  The game is very shallow, and extremely unbalanced.  And the developer likes to play hide and go seek with your save game, he hid it in the windows registry, lame developer.If you want to delete your game file good luck, first you'll have to run a search and then edit your registry 'cause this developer could not take the time to do it right like every other game made.

At first I must say I can`t confirm any technical Problems with this game. Although the Game places your Window not in Full screen Mode when you select windowed Mode and your Monitors Resolution. It puts the Game in an actual Window. But that’s not a Bug, it`s only sort of inconvenient.Defense Zone 2is a Standard Tower Defense Game (don`t need to say what you do in a Tower Defense Game). It`s a lot like Defense Grid. If you liked those Games, you properly like this one too.But in contrast to DG, DZ2 has 31 Vanilla Levels + it`s much more Difficult. There are 3 Settings, whereas on the last Level ""easy"", is already an achievement.There isn`t much more to say about this Game, except that the Levels only vary in the form, that they ramp up the difficulty and add more simultaneous Lanes + Multiple Air Lanes and tougher/faster Walker. In Addition you got a neat Overload function in every tower. It keeps you on your toes, because it can get you out of though spots. But it needs to charge and triggered manually, so you can`t just do fast forward all the time.Pro:PriceDifficulty / Difficulty SettingsEasy to learn, hard to masterContra:The Game is nothing special (but must it?)For that Price it`s a bargain (don`t wait, it will not get discounted further. Already waited). Really solid Tower Defense Game that will get you some nice Gaming time. It`s really nice to play while you’re doing something else on the Side, like watching a Film. "

												This is a somewhat better tower defense game than the first game. It allows air strkes, with a somewhat lengthy cooldown, once or twice per level. Towers can be placed wherever the circle around them is blue, not in predetermined places. Nice graphics, sound effects, and music. A fine TD game.			"

												(fan of TD) (edit: level 30 reached)Many others are correct:This game coaxes you into the kitchen for a few levels, then spanks you hard with a wooden spoon.Get this game, and stick with it.It's ragequit-frustrating and hella rewarding.Sometimes a perfect blend of towers is in order;... other times, you just freeze the snot outta them and send in the high explosives.~~~ 9/10 ~~~ so VERY worth the price.

												this game could be better if it was equilibrated and follow a logic sequance of difficulty. suddenly some levels become extremelly hard, even harder than the following one. also it would increase its quaility and the  pleasure of playing if the enemy vehicles not overlapped each other as if they were made of some kind of liquid matter. the power of some vehicules is absurd against tons of detonations and missiles and the infantry runs a lot more of the motorized trucks and tanks. mediocre game...

Then with no warning, you will be defeated simply because the idiot developers decided that it is ok for the enemy to start at any poing along the path!DO NOT BUY!!!			"

New weapons have been added, along with new opponents, and even more action and tactics. Greater variety of weaponry and landscape types gives you huge freedom in choosing your battle tactics. Choose the right weapon type and position to make sure your defense is effective. Airstrikes and the possibility of temporarily increasing weapon power can give you the advantage, and guarantee you will never get bored in the battle process. - Recommended!			"

You Place Your Units, You Kill Some Dudes.What can be said about this cavalcade of blastification? Not a whole lot. I love games like this. Though admittedly, I turned sound and music off after a short time, which isn't to say it's terrible, I still had a great experience playing this. I'm sure it can be addictive. You work with a limited amount of space, where you have to carefully place your units and upgrade them as you deal with a quick influx of enemies in wave after wave of dude-and-vehicle shootery. The same things don't work on every level, so it stays challenging. Lots of challenges will keep you playing, and it's easy to have your time eaten up in mission after mission. The only downsides to it are repetitive gameplay, and I think the soundtrack is a little weak on second playthrough. 7/10! Recommended. Right price for a fun game that will pay for itself in a few hours.			"

Or how about the 'hellfire' option, which seems to produce neither hell nor fire.Haven't tried 'hard' as there's no real point.			"
