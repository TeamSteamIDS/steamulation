												A game that LOST its roots.The game passed to another developper and another publisher. Things got worst.I explain. The designers tried to differenciate things more by building the races in a different way.In this game we have ONLY two races comparing to the 3 plus the scourge we had in the first Perimeter, the Exodus and the HeartBack.So, the story says that the new world those races were searching finally found. But the Exodus still can colonize the surface while the HeartBack can build in Water.If you are a Perimeter Veteran please read the differences below, after the many dashes.For the Newcomers to this game.Here we have a simple strategy game. You first build the energy cores and terraform the ground so you can move easily or build upon it. To do that on the easy way build every NEXT energy core to the change of the levels of the ground and press the terraform button of the NEW energy core. In other ways you'll get yourself saying some bad words if NOT smushing the PC or leaving the game completely. The manual terraforming controls are buggy so don't be frustrated. The only thing you'll need the manual terraforming is when you want to get some blue crystals and you'll need to dig the ground.Every technology as the game says must be researched first. So if you want to build unit factories you need to research them first. So level 2 and 3 factories. The factories create the pop cap. But you can't have as many factories as you want as the preserve energy. The units from the factories have ground and air mode. You change them dependant on what you want to attack or defend because ground units don't fight air.Generally is a very simple game that tricks your imagination. Nothing more.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have played the first Perimeter....The game differences are Massive.--There is no Frame here. No main building. No King of Chess. You start building like any other strategy game.--The energy cores can be built anywhere at start. The terraform process is included in them and can be set at automatic mode or manual. Manual terraforming is crap. You use it only to level the ground where you want and then auto. The controls for the manual are buggy. A very easy way to keep the level of the ground the same(but you lose space) is to build the energy cores to the gaps that the ground changes levels. When you press the terraform button the ground will be in the same level as the OLD energy core. But as you can see in this game you have to be occupied even to that.--Population cap is related to the factories and is NOT standard as in the first game. Every factory places about 2 more squads and the squad units number is about 1-4 dependant on the unit. Factories preserve energy like in Command and Conquer and NOT like in the first Perimeter when ONLY working. In this way the squad number is limited. --You have a Research Center to advance your technology. To build the 3-set level of factories you have to research them as much other techs like PLUS in Weapons or Shields for your units. The first level builds light units, the second level medium units and the third heavy units that are effective in buildings most.--So we have ONLY 3 units per race that can be changed from ground to air and vice versa depedant of the opponents offensive and defensive. For example fighters confront fighters and the vehicles other vehicles. There is NO unit from the ground to hit the air.--The chess game that we were playing in the first Perimeter with the capturing of the energy cores or buildings of the opponent is VERY limited here, because the Exodus structures are damaged from water and the HeartBack structures from the normal ground.--There are NO subterrastrial units on this game.--Ahh yes, I almost forgot. New power-ups like Nukes,mass terra destruction and such are coming from the blue ingame crystals like OLD techs that you find on the planet's surface. To get those crystals you'll need to build an energy core on them and MANUALLY terraform the ground in DIGGING mode.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Whoever wants to read my review about the first Perimeter, he/she can find it  here.The AI is very easy even in skirmishes. Don't get amazed by the new graphics of the game. I was and there were NOT many youtube videos to see what is happening In Game.As a result his game has NO FUTURE! If you want to relax by playing something ok. But NO MORE than that...			"

												No. Don't do it. Not even for cheap.This game could have neat terraforming mechanics, but the UI, dialogue, tutorial and basically the whole presentation is painful. I literally got a headache trying to get into the first level. During which the gameplay was sub-par and unintuitive.			"

												How about a worthwhile review?Two sides, two advantages, capture mechanics (it's been a very long time, i remember capturing something), generate your power levels unlock new buildings, build units to defend or attack, turn towers into defences, use ground or water as weapons. Create a long gameplay by flooding back the enemy using water, or build the tallest plateu with ground. Artillery is an option.The game had much promise, very similar to maelstrom, but of course without the masses of armies and first person view of a hero.That all being said, the problem is how the game is not going to work for everyone, it ran out of compatibility for some systems, while it had compatibility for others with the same hardware, go figure.I enjoyed it while it lasted when i first had it, but eventually after changing systems i couldn't play it without a crash. Also the variety and diversity in the end just run out, nothing new to do, nothing new to find, just kill that in your own way capture that somehow, etcetcetc. A one way ticket to a game that has no real end, until you decide when you had enough.

												It's not the first game.The first game was, out of left field, a resoundingly well-designed, beautiful, polished, mysterious, novel experience. This game nukes about every single one of those things. It's buggy and clunky. It's got some seriously questionable unit and UI designs. Much of the universe development in the original game is ignored or blatantly subverted. And a lot of the coolest gameplay elements from the first game are just not there, for no reason whatsoever.If you're on this page, you're here because Perimiter was so cool and so viscerally unorthodox within the realm of modern RTSes, and you're hoping there's more of that experience somewhere. There may be. But it isn't here.			"

												It's been a long time since I played this one, but my recollection is that it has some good ideas, but they're let down by flaws in the execution - terraforming on land, you end up with different levels of terrain competing for space, and it's hard to tell which level you'll be terraforming to.The water faction was much less fiddly to play, but not sufficiently for me to want to go back to the game.

												A huge disappointement. From the 15+ units from the first game, we're down at 3 units per race, with only one ability once. From the 3 races from the first game, we're down to 2 races. From the huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of defensive turrets from the first game, we're down to 3 turrets.This game is the perfect example of what happens if you're oversimplifying a sequel. Sure, it's easier, but it's also BOOORING, as all you have to do is spamming the unique Tier 1 unit and spam Tier 2 turret.			"

												First I just want to say besides my number of steam hours I've been playing this game since it got out, I bought the game on the wintersales because it came with the other 2 Perimeters.So this game is different from its pre-quels but not by a long shot.PROs-The new terraforming system which for Harkback is awesome, flooding the map (or drying if you are Exodus) it's a game changing mechanic.-The territorial mode in battle mode which is great since you don't use units, only terraforming elements(and turrets but I tend to destroy them to keep the game longer).-Element SuperPowers, if you are Harkback you'll have  a freaking meteor that when it hits the ground not only destroys everything but also produces more water.Neither PROs nor CONs, just IMO-This game doesn't use frames which I like when they were the center of the network, instead you can move your build masters and transforming them into geo/aqua cores where you want.-No underground units(which they would be pretty useless vs Harkback) but could be nice if Harkback use ground and underground units while Exodus still used ground and flying unitsCONs	I'll start with the Exodus- First the Terraforming It would be expected that if you are terraforming land you at different levels of landscaping you could build your buildings there or you would be a great disadvantage. Well nope, even if you have a pixel of uneven landscape, you are pretty much screwed since you won't have enough space, which Harkback doesn't suffer from this even if you build 10 aquacores close of which other and terraform to make a ""water mountain"" and uneven the water you can still build there.-Second the PowersWell if the Exodus is land their powers will be earth related like the ability of scum disruptor to create volcanos. For some reason the devs missed this part or they had the brilliant ideia in turning the Exodus in the new Empire, because Exodus got a freaking nuke, Harkback got a meteor that blasts, annihilates everything and produces water, Exodus got a nuke the dries everything and does damage equal to the distance of the ground, if there is plenty of water good luck trying to destroy anything but if harkback is close. Clearly the devs missed the Empire. Atleast their secondary powers is to make a twister which is much, much better.-Third the ""Special"" UnitThis is what I believe was the discussion of making the Exodus Special Unit by the devs.Dev Group Leader: ""Who has some inovated ideias about Exodus special units?""Random Dev nº1: So the Harkback use water, the water level keeps raising, it would be smart to use some unit like the previous games, like the scum heater, a unit the flies and has a powerfull beam the could also dry the water.""Dev Group Leader: ""Nah scrap that ideia.""Random Dev nº2: ""Since the water level keeps rising, we should make a giant catapult like scum thrower, to one shot cores like the golem of the Harkback does.""Dev Group Leader: ""That ideia is stupid, you're stupid.""Random Dev nº3 that worked there and no one knows why: ""I know we should make a unit that makes the other units stealth like Empire had.""Dev Group Leader:"" I love it, you get a raise the rest of you are fired.""Yes the special unit of exodus is another copy from the Empire, a unit that makes the other units (but only ground units stealth and the aoe is so tiny that you either use only on tier 3 with them above of each other or that thing is useless, even in certain maps although it's hovering it's many times buggedand just flies randomly. Even in the previous games the Empire stealth unit could hide flying units.-Fourth Perimeter vs GolemDon't even bother to use the perimeter(or Shield) to protect you from golem because it won't work. This is for both Factions -Only 3 units (light, medium, heavy) that have flying mode or ground mode.-The unit cap is related to the number of factories of both factions.-Since the moment a factory is built it starts to consume energy even if it's not working.-You only have a building that works like the many labs you have in Perimeter 1.So, why do I reccomend this game you ask?I reccomend it for the simple fact that I always enjoyed terraforming and it's unique concept, even thought I wrote so many CONs, to me that concept outshines the CONs, this is why I spent hours of playing this game, trying to flood dry maps and dry flood maps.

												   I had to actually had to check the release date on this game after I played it the first time. For something that was originally release in 2008, It felt like something hot off the presses from back in 2000.    I don't really have anything good to say about this one really. You only get 3 offensive units per faction. 3. One for each tech tier you have to research. I have never, in my life seen an RTS that only had 3 offensive units. While this could be offset by emplacements, 3 offensive units. That is not right.   Both graphics and Audio feel very retro, and not in a good way. For something that was originally released in 2008, this game is a far cry from a standard at the time. Perhaps the only interesting thing I can say about this game (not necessarily good), is the ability to terraform. But that in itself is nowhere near enough to make up for its shortcomings.   Overall, This one should be avoided. I was so dissapointed by the tutorial, I never actually made into the campaign. As far as RTS games go, this one in below the games you get from scraping the bottom of the barrel.			"

												No. Stay away from this game and watch letsplays of it instead.They had great and easy terraforming, unit morphing mechanic, energy network mechanic, territory control mechanic... AND THEY DONE SCREWED IT UP.While most RTS entertain player with interesting missions, cutscenes, story arcs, Perimeter II has enemy base destruction for breacfast, lunch, dinner and supper. Combined with horrible UI, unbalanced terraforming (exodus strifes for every scrap of perfectly flat ground to build something larger than small turret, while harkback gets infinite ammount of perfectly flat water surface) and cosmetically different sides, this gives you that one game you don't want to play.0/10, with Epic Fail seal of disapproval for MUTILATING the source material.

												Perimeter 2 and Strong Hold 3 have ruined the concept of sequels for me. Perimeter 2 is nothing like Perimeter and is a bit of a scam to be honest. It is one of the worst RTS games I’ve ever played and feels as if no effort went into making it. It gave me the distinct impression the developer was just trying to cash in on the cult like success of the original Perimeter, but with minimal work. Ignoring all that, Its just a terrible, boring game, please for your sakes don’t buy it, even if you refund it, you still waste your time (unfortunately for me, like stronghold 3, I bought this game when it first came out, expecting it to share the quality of its predecessor, before steam refunds existed, so I can not get I refund).
