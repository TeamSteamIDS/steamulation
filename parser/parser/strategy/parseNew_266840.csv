												Reviewing a remake of a game that is over ten years old is a little difficult, especially if the remake is nearly an exact copy of the original game.  In this case, “Age of Mythology: Extended Edition” is nearly identical.  Everything from the character models to the level design remain the same.  Don’t get me wrong, it looks much prettier than I remember it…but aside from the extras, you’re getting the same game you played years prior.  Same scoop of vanilla ice cream if you will, but with jimmies and chocolate syrup on top.  Shadows, lighting, water effects, time of day, antialiasing, ambient occlusion…all great additions, I just wish there was a bit more.  Twitch users will be pleased to know that there is Twitch integration, though I personally haven’t tried it to know if it works.With that being said, I do appreciate the remake, even if it’s almost the same game as I played years ago.  Seeing the updated graphics was nice, though I admit the appeal was mainly centered around the fact that I didn’t have to enter my blasted serial key each time I wanted to install the game.  I also don’t have to worry about managing discs…all three products (“Age of Mythology”, “Age of Mythology: The Titans”, “Golden Gift Campaign”) were all condensed into one nice, easy to boot up package.  It’s hard to justify that convenience into a thirty dollar price tag however, the going rate as of 4/29/14.  If you’ve never played “Age of Mythology”, love RTS’s, and don’t mind the outdated character models/interface, then picking this up is most certainly worth your time and money. If you have your own playable copies of the game from years ago and want to know if buying the extended edition for the effects is worth thirty bucks, then I’d have to say (with heartfelt regret) no.Full Review:http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/Gameplay Video:

												Ordinarily, I don't write reviews - but I've always been pretty invested in the Ensemble Studios games and seeing what Microsoft and Skybox have done with one of their all-time legends has pushed me into comment.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition. Ordinarily, to extend something means to prolong it or make it bigger somehow but if you're hoping for new content, this game does not have any. It's just the same game you played back in 2003 - but that's not so bad, because that game was great. This however, isn't - and there's some vital reasons as to why:1 - The Multiplayer. The most important aspect of any Real Time Strategy game is its multiplayer community and Age of Mythology has always had a creative and thriving one. This Extended Edition would too - if the multiplayer actually worked. You don't need me to tell you, just go check out the Support forum for this game. The game suffers from consistent crashes, desync, stuttering, framedrops and lag when attempting an online game. The developers blame ""ancient bugs"" left over from the original game despite the fact that none of these bugs were actually present in the 2003 release and accusing the now defunct Ensemble Studios (thanks Microsoft) for being responsible for your own mistakes is downright cowardly. disrespectful and lazy especially seeing as you're now flogging their product to an unaware market.2 - The Single Player. The AI during Single Player matches is bizarre, eclectic and at often times completely incomprehensible. Prone to suddenly stopping all activity halfway through a match for completely banal reasons (there was no food in their line of sight, you spawned too close to them etc) every Random Match is essentially a roll-of-the-dice of whether or not the AI feels like playing along this time. This problem has only been made worse by the addition of the new, COMPULSORY DLC which has 'updated' the AI to coincide with the introduction of a new civilization. Unfortunately, those who don't purchase the DLC are still obligated to download the patch, meaning they suffer from all of the bugs whilst receiving none of the reward.3 - The DLC.  Most likely what drew you to this Steam page in the first place seeing as this game hasn't seen a real increase in playerbase in almost a year. I followed the development of the DLC for a good few months and have been heavily invested in it. The attitude of the developers and their 'effort' as far as producing quality content goes is detestable. Aside from the rather invested and community-involved attitude from those at ForgottenEmpires (a small team of fans), comment and involvement from the lead developers (Skybox) has consisted of grade-1♥♥♥♥♥♥all. They spent a good few months assuring us the DLC would contain strictly new, fresh content without any reskinning, repackaging or rebranding of existing content and that turned out to be a complete lie. They also lied about having playtested the game for balance - admitting during a public streaming of the game (you can find it on Youtube) that they purposefully left the DLC broken and unbalanced as a means of making people have to play it. The DLC itsels is incredibly broken as of writing this (again, check the Support forum), with half the playerbase unable to access the DLC at all and the other half jokingly trying to laugh off the regret of their purchase.One of the developers admitted on the Subreddit that they are currently ""using the public to beta test the game"" - meaning that if you buy this DLC you are not getting content, you are buying into the opportunity to test unfinished content. This coupled with the fact that the developers openly laughed at the idea of fixing the Multiplayer (again, check the stream) tells me that we aren't dealing with incompetent developers - we're dealing with scam artists.I don't like having to write this sort of stuff about any Ensemble Studios IP because it sucks seeing their legacy♥♥♥♥♥♥on by untalented coat-tail riders, but if it means discouraging people from wasting their money on what is essentially a gigantic bug test, then it feels somewhat worthwhile. Only buy this if you absolutely *must* play Age of Mythology again and don't want to go through the effort of pirating the old copy and getting it to work - but know that this is not the Age of Mythology you played ten years ago and it certainly is not a well-supported or active game.

												Age of Mythology is the classic, mythology based spinoff of Age of Empires, and boy was it fun. But does Age of Mythology  Extended Edition live up to the original? In many ways, very much so, though the price tag might dissaude you unless you're a huge fan, (like I am). If you've played Age of Mythology before, you know exactly how this game works. If not, here a basic gist of it. It plays much like Age of Empires 2; you have to collect resources, specifically food, wood and gold, in order to fund your armies, economies, technologies and advancement. sounds basic enough, and all the races work similarly in regards to these resources. The difference comes in the fourth resource: Favour. Favour is generated differently depending on which race you are playing. For instance, the greeks generate favour through worship, the egyptians through building monuments, the norse through heroes and fighting, and the atlanteans through having more settlements. Favour is the special resource, which ties into the major mechanic of Age of Mythology: Gods and God Powers. There are 12 major gods, 3 for each of the races, and these determine starting bonuses for you when you start the game. the gods also have minor gods to choose each time you advance an age, with a total of 36 minor gods, each offering different bonuses and god powers. For instance Hades gives you the Sentinel God Power, that creates stone sentinels to watch over your town centre, but in the second age, you can choose Athena, who allows you to train minotaurs and the Restoration God power which can heal your units.Aside from the new favour mechanic, for the major part it plays like the age of empires games. Build Army, upgrade, and take care of your population cap and economy. Rock paper scissors, for basic units, (cavalry beats archers who beat infantry), but add heroes and myth units which can turn the tide of battle. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer are fun, and with the new release, there is a rebirth in the multiplayer, though not as big as the heyday of AoM. As being essentially a remake (a la Age of Empires 2 HD Edition), AoM:EE is actually fairly bug free, and while it definitely shows its age, the added subtle lighting effects, water and shadows do help to make look better. It is definitely very playable, and for fans of the original, it shouldn't even be a bother.The campaign is just as memeroable as always, a hunt through Greece, Egypt, Scandinavia and finally Atlantis in order to stop a power hungry cyclops from releasing Kronos, King of the Titans; followed by A New Atlantis, set a number of years later,  where you are tricked into releasing the Titans, and must stop them at all costs . Overall, Age of Mythology: Extended Editon is fun, unique and offers up plenty of value, with 50 singleplayer missions, skrimishes, and now revived multiplayer, though for those who still have a copy of Age of Mythology and The Titans expansion, it might not add a great deal. Definitely recommend everyone else (who's a fan of older RTSes). "

												\ Ignore the amount of hours I have here, I've played the original game and the Titans expansion for hundreds of hours. / - THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED THE ORIGINAL GAME SKIP THE FIRST PARAGRAPH - Age of Mythology is a simple strategy game to get into, but hard to master. The game has 3 campaigns (although not the same length) and PvP multiplayer (Online, AI and LAN). The first campaign alone (32 levels) is a lot of fun and the story is very interesting; it will take more than 30 hours to complete this campaign alone! Add on the Titans campaign and another one (which I haven't played yet) and you can easily get over 60 hours of play-time.The multiplayer is nice and easy to set up and a lot of fun and very competitive.The mechanics are pretty much the same as any other RTS (Real Time Strategy) game: gather resources, build a big city and army, and finally demolish the enemy. Unlike other RTS games I have tried in the past, the game is easy to learn and the UI is very well set out and organised: you will rarely, if never, get confused as to what's going on or what you're supposed to do to advance/beat the level.Now, I'll talk about the remastering of the game.The game is pretty much the same, apart from the inclusion of the expansions straight away; you won't find anything new gameplay-wise or content-wise. What has improved is the support for high screen resolutions (including multi-monitor setups, which I have tried myself and... oh boy... it's faboulous), better shadows and lighting. A cool addition is the ability to stream on Twitch directly from the game; I haven't tried doing so myself but I think it's a nice feature.Lastly, there's Mods. Still have to play around with them, but as far as I've seen there's some quality stuff.\ VERDICT /If you have played Age of Mythology before and want to re-experience everything again and compete against other players, this game won't disappoint you. BUY THIS GAME.But if you're expecting new stuff, you're out of luck.If you have never played Age of Mythology you're missing out a lot. BUY THIS GAME.If you have played any Age of Empires game and you enjoyed them BUY THIS GAME.This is the longest review I've ever written on Steam.			"

												As you see I've spent over 600 hours playing this game, and that is not even a lot when you compare it to the time I played the original game for. Definitely had to re-write my review since my other one was made after 30 gameplay hours.Age of Mythology takes you into one of the most unique and timeless RTS experiences I have ever seen. You have to pick between 4 civilizations: the Greek, Egyptian, Norse and Atlantean - each have 3 major gods to pick from. There are 4 ages to guide your civilization through, each of which unlocks new buildings, upgrades and units.  Each of these presents you with two choices for minor gods that you can worship. Every time you choose a god(including the major god), you will unlock a god power that can be used only once (up to 3 times if you're Atlantean) as well as a mythological creature or two that are associated with your god choice + unique upgrades. These god powers can change the tide of the game entirely.Each civilization is completely different in their design, and there can be differences between identical major gods as well thanks to the minor god system.The units classes featured are infantry, cavalry, archers, siege, heroes, mythological creatures and ships. The game makes these interact in a rock-paper-sciccor mechanic.The campaign is very high quality for its time, it can be highly entertaining even now, though. A total of around 50 missions is more than any RTS game will give you. The voice acting is great, though the dialouge and the plot get cheesy at points.Graphically, the shadows, the water improvements, the map texture improvements are nice, but they cannot hide the dated models and textures. I wish those had been areas of focus when it comes to visual improvements. The lighting is terrible in a few cases, so I would recommend turning the ""lights on units"" option off, as it's the worst of all new features. FXAA and water refraction aren't too helpful either, but to each their own.The multiplayer is awesome design vise. A multitude of game modes, custom scenarios (aka minigames), supremacy(standard mode), deathmatch(high starting resources, all upgrades researched) etc will definitely keep you hooked for months, if not years. Multiplayer performance, while improved via patches, is still not perfect, but definitely playable. Just make sure you don't run on an integrated graphics card. If you have both an integrated card and a dedicated one in your system, make sure the game defaults to the dedicated one via your driver.As for the competitiveness of multiplayer, ranked games are available via a matchmaking system that will attempt matching you against player of similar skill. Most, if not all methods of abusing the system have been dealt with by the developers.Overall I am happy with the game, but it could have been so much better. Rating it below:Graphics: 5/10Single player content: 10/15Multiplayer content: 12/15Music, sounds: 10/10Moddability, replayability: 11/15Stability, bugs: 5/15E-sport features (replays, observer mode): 8/10Cost/value: 7/10Final score: 68%			"

Posted: October 1, 2014
												I wrote a review for this a while back, and I can say with confidence many issues have been sorted out, but some are still persistent.If you have never played this game, I am going to say right now to buy this game and play it. The campaign and its storyline is great, the factions are unique and well fleshed out and balance, for the most part, is achieved with some minor discrepencies/exploits which with experience can be learned to be countered.I will say that the game is not in its glory days anymore as this IS a re-release of a fairly old title. But the multiplayer is also active enough to have a competitive community and there is a revival in the scenario community to experience a taste of the legacy of AoM mapmakers, I suggest looking on http://aom.heavengames.com/downloads/ for more or the Steam workshop downloads provided.But lets start with the actual meat of the game for anyone reading for determining whether to buy this:The Extended Edition brings many new improvements over old Age of Mythology and the Titans expansion included, water and other graphics are overhauled and improved significantly. Graphics in general have been improved over the original and the game looks much more vibrant and detailed. This makes playing the singleplayer campaign, which is still one of the better campaigns of an RTS I have played, much more enjoyable.A new online server is also available for multiplayer gameplay and while its nowhere even close to the glory days of ESO in terms of activity and the amount of scenario makers, some old faces are there both in competitive gameplay and with old mapmakers, and some newer map makers such as myself have been sprouting up. In terms of connection these days it really depends on whose actually in the game but as long as you're computer isn't a toaster your connection and running of this game should go forward without a hitch.However there is still some bugs that are highly irritating that remain. Desync errors still happen too frequently for my tastes and this wouldn't be so much a problem if it didn't lower the rating of those involved in ranked matches. When someone is on the verge of victory and then a desync error occurs to make them lose rating... its understandable someone would be angry.There is also more visible lag and connection issues between players then there was on the old AoM in certain instances, such as on certain scenarios or with people with very bad connection to begin with. And the Extended Edition is notable in how it actually lags your computer- some of us may remember we could browse the internet with Age of Mythology running in windowed mode or running other programs while we wait for a game; while this isn't prevented and is still possible the speed of which you do so is stifling and I would not recommend it at all now. (Nor would I recommend it in matches even back then, but if you're in lobby just idling, waiting for your friend to host that game...)I suggest if you are buying this, do not play on your toaster or similar dinosaur computer, this is an updated version of Age of Mythology meant to be played on semi modern machines.And as for scenario editors who wish to return to making maps for this game: The online multiplayer community is in desperate need of scenario revival. There is scenarios still being played from time to time but the newer population of competitive players is either unaware of most of the maps or simply do not host them, mostly the former. As for the editor itself, for all intents and purposes its more or less the same as what we know, but there is some notable differences now.The differences boil down to some old trigger techniques not working, and now causing horrible lag. The old trick of looping Move Army To to move your spawned units to a location, looping it within the trigger editor now causes horrible lag and no longer just simply makes them keep moving there. It acts as if the computer stops their units and tells them to move there, acting as if the loop was just restarting and stopping the order instead of merely continuing it as it did in the past.There is also UI changes to the editor, and while the function is largely the same it takes a bit getting used to. I can say with confidence though the editor is still fairly user friendly and easy to learn, though trying to find experienced mappers to help you with your project is a little difficult in terms of looking on the lobby- you'll have to consult various forums like AoM heaven or pitch it on the steam forums for this game somewhere. I myself can help with things too, and even old legends like Nottud are still around if you look...So it boggles down to this, overall: Should you buy this game if you are new, and should you buy this game if you already have age of mythology, the original and its expansion, to relive your nolstalgia?If you are new, refer to the top. Yes. If you are an old and musty returning player like me, Yes, but don't expect it to be total brass and shine throughout the entire game. There is some grime to be worked out with this still but I can say with confidence there has been legitimate work and attention on this game to improve it and fix bugs.(p.s Potato, if you review my review im going to shoot you and feed you to a chimera, not only was your review pointless, it was awful in its critique and if anything uninformative. No one cares about grammar to that extent, it's all about presentation, and the clarity of my review was fine. That is all :D ) "

												I have been playtesting Age of Mythology: Extended Edition for a week, played over 30h, and yes, the game is worth it. If you are at least marginally into RTS, this is a game you shouldn't miss.If you are new to AoM, you're in for a good old real-time strategy experience that shaped the world of RTS gaming, all in a fun mythological setting. Specific mechanics like god powers and mythological units make the gameplay unique and interesting, bringing different style, but with the same basics, to the whole of ""Age of"" franchise, the paragon of strategy gaming.If you played the original, you're going to get the same great gaming experience, but with some extra goodies. Obvious are enhanced graphics and support of today's resolutions (I've been playing on 1920x1200 with no problems) - the graphics take a while getting used to as there are some harder to discern things due to the new lighting and colour scheme of map backgrounds, but overall the change is nice and adds to the game, making it more attractive for first timers.The most important addition is revitalisation of multiplayer through Steam, which looks just like old ESO. You have Quick Search for random matchmaking, advanced games for all your fun and scenario games, chat lobby and they added Leagues and Events. They've also included Treaty mode (ceasefire until certain amount of time) and the option to disable Titans (the unit). You can check the video I made about the Multiplayer Online Lobby

			A comprehensive playtesting look at the online multiplayer lobby (aka new ESO) for Age of Mythology: Extended Edition. Quick search, advanced games, ladders, chats... All there!		

Another fun thing is the Steam Workshop and the fact the game has been made more friendly to modders. AoM community has always been full of talented people producing fun and useful content like various UIs and custom scenarios, and even before launch, there are mods already trickling in. Plus most of the original custom scenarios should work even on AoM:EE, so no real way to get bored with this game :-)Last thing in need of mentioning is improved support of Observer Mode and streaming - you can now see various in-game stats of players like resources, upgrades in process and similar in an easy to navigate table to give you a better idea of how are the players doing, and you can also switch to players' perspectives. This same interface works in recorded games, so you can analyse even those.All in all a nice remake of a great game. If you loved the original, you'll enjoy this, if this is your first time with AoM, you'll enjoy it, too :-)If you'd like to see the game in action, check my livestream http://www.twitch.tv/blackaddersplays and the videos on my YouTube https://www.youtube.com/BlackAddersPlays

												Pixel Judge Age of Mythology: Extended Edition reviewThe VerdictAge of Mythology: Extended Edition is a very good cash-in on an old game. RTS market isn‘t really oversaturated and AoMEE is still a solid game. Two good (and one less so) campaigns that are bundled together with really fun skirmish, and all of that is topped by an excellent map editor, and now, Steam Workshop integration. What else could one ask? Surely not a sequel, because it would suck.Score: 4.5/5 - Still a legendary game.Full review and appeals - http://www.pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/ "

												I first bought this game on CD, (Age of Mythology: Titan's Expansion Gold Edition). When I played it, I found it to be one of the best games I have ever played and to this day it still is. This type of brilliant RTS game is sadly practically dead. Which makes this game a must-have for anyone who is looking for a gem. The campaign for both Age of Mythology and then the Titan's Expansion are both amazing. I am a person who usually does not play the campaign's since they are far from enjoyable. Yet this storyline will make you want to play it, you will want to know what is going to happen next.Why did I hit ""Not Recommend"" then? Very simple, ""Age of Mythology: Extended Edition."" These new developers are a insult and a slap in the face to a brilliant game. I went and bought the Extended Edition when I heard a new DLC was coming out. When I play Extended Edition, some of the textures they have ""enhanced"" look far worse. I could not believe the terrible lighting and how awful the Hades States for the Temple looks. It is like a slap in the face to the Greek gods. The DLC is far worst, next to all the ""new"" units are actually just reskins of units from the other factions! I have continued to hear that the campaign is buggy and terrible. If this DLC was a mod, I would have deleted it and gave it a thumbs down for no effort. I refuse to play the new DLC and ruin my image of this beautiful game that has already been tainted by these amateurs...What I recommend you do? Go and buy :Age of Mythology: Titan's Expansion"" or ""Age of Mythology: Gold Edition"".  It is only $10-$15 and you will like the untainted version so much more. I love this game and I would love to see it continued, but not by these childish developers who have no respect for this game or doing a honest day's work.			"

												Simply an awesome game. As a new AoM player, but an old AoE player, I am certainly impressed and cannot believe that I missed this game during its original days. All the best qualities of Age of Empires combined with an unique mythic atmosphere. If, like me, you never played this game before, now it's certainly the time to get it. Otherwise you're probably looking for the Steam improvements such as Multiplayer and Workshop support. See you online!			"

												I was fooled by myself, thinking this would be a great Extension to AOM, I feel that the developers and the people who worked on this (Sky box) have cashed in, knowing people will buy this regardless if they polish it well or badly because of nostalgia and the sly meta critic score that was taken from the original release several years ago. They knew there were going to be problems with this game upon release, it is disgusting to think that any company would release a product which is not up to scratch especially since the game was already released. I didn't pay the already expensive price to play a beta of a game that already exists. They have not delivered in my opinion, the AI is still terrible, the Multiplayer is lagging (reason I bought this game) and the frame rate is questionable for a game like this, the lighting effects are nothing special if not distracting and the menus are different (compared to the originals) but either way, re-mastered or not, the menus fulfilled their purpose, to be menus. I don't see how this warrants at £20 price tag. To make matters worse me and my friends are encountering problems with the steam overlay which is hindering our multiplayer experience. The steam workshop is also not working.I do not recommend buying this until the price drops and the problems with it are fixed, I will not trust this company again I thought AOE2 should have been a good indication of how they handle projects like these, I feel silly to have used the benefit of the doubt.Age of Mythology (when it is working) however is an excellent strategy game for competitive play, the multiplayer is excellent and the different civilizations are unique in terms of units, technologies and strategies that can be applied, it makes for a fresh experience on an age old formula, If only they continued after Age of Empires 3.

This is still a great game that will give you the same satisfaction that you have gotten from the other titles. The campaign is fun and quite a lengthy investment. The expansion added campaign following the original is fantastic as well. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353515278You can live without the dwarves focused one, while it has some fun ideas for maps it's short, easy and lacks any real depth . The main problem I had with these in the newest steam version was that the graphical quality seems to have been dramatically reduced.The day and night cycle is over rated and really serves no point, if anything I found it broke the game up more and turned it off. Multiplayer is fun but expect to play against strong players. Random AI matches are the same as before but with two new game types. They can be fun but I've always been a conquest or occasionally supremacy fan. Overall it's basically the same game that it was in the past. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353515262The steam community seems to have produced a nice array of new mods to enjoy and I've had fun revisiting this game once again. If you are considering repurchasing this game, wait for a sale and pick it up cheap, it's the same game. If you are looking at this game for the first time and enjoy similar games in the ""age of"" series you should enjoy this title and get your money's worth from it but it may seem a little dated at first.

												The DLC changed the main game, forcing new crappy units onto the game, and you´re not able to disable them, neither are you able to disable the new DLC gods, because the devs want money obviously, so they´ll keep pestering you, and will allow their buyers to play as much as they like online with the crappy new gods. So many bugs in the game, way more than there was in the past, and alot more disconnections since the DLC was introduced. Skybox completly ruined the AOM special feeling...""May very well be the only RTS game you´ll ever need"" a review said more than 10 years ago, written on the back of the disc version.  That perfectly describes and sums up the unique feeling of aom, both casually and competitve. If you´re a hardcore fan since 2002, then you´ll be very disappointed in this digital steam version...Truly miss the old ESO servers ...if you want to play this game, use the disc version and go to voobly (preferable) or GR. This is only good if you want to play scenarios. If you want a proper match, stay away from this garbage.oh...and to anyone who´s been playing online, don´t forget "" new badges coming soon""...			"

												If you are looking for a multiplayer RTS, and your internet speed isn't incredible, move along. That said, if you are interested in single player or have amazing internet connection, go right ahead. In Short - There is a compounded latency issue. Animation quality is directly proportional to connection quality. One player with a bad connection (Or a large number of players) will slow your game. And when it slows down your game, it slows down everything causing animations to lag and glitch. They’ve updated the server client code in the Extended Edition, where they didn't need to (causing terrible bugs).In Long: Instead of a dedicated server setup. AOM now uses a peer to peer connection. The Pros are that you don't need to create servers, or port forward. But the downside is that the next iteration of the game cannot continue until every player has received information from every other player. This means that with more players, more information is required to be sent before a game iteration occurs. Additionally, with one player with a high latency, that latency affects every single player within the game. Currently with this problem, AOM game speed slows down, affecting EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF GAMEPLAY. This includes MODEL ANIMATION (Imagine bad connection = laggy and glitchy character models). However, this game would have been fine it they either: When the game speed is slowed down, change the timings of the model animations to match the new game speed (Just play on lightning speed to compensate).…Or just kept the old dedicated server engine for AOM.It saddens me that I cannot play this game reasonably with my friends, and I don’t want others to be disappointed. Considering that we all pre-paid, none of us can get a refund for the game we bought. That said, if you are interested in single player or have amazing internet connection, go right ahead.			"

												Age of Mythology is a great game.  This version of it unfortunately does not work.  I usually spend a couple hours starting a game, and for well above 50% of the games I try it either crashes and corrupts the save, completely losing my progress, or the framerate randomly starts alternating between about 5 seconds of normal fps, then dropping to completelly unplayable levels.  I certainly wish I could play this game, but as of now I have literally yet to sucessfully complete a full game without some glitch ending the game for me.			"

It`s really fun, That same friend had gifted to me here on Steam.✔ pros-----------> massive replayability> you learn alot about Mythology> various gods and powers to choose from> (personally) not a turn base game> online servers / tornuaments > various maps to play on> mod friendly✘ cons-----------> barely to almost no changes> NOT worth full price> AI are extremely annoying } attacking super early in the match, spamming your towns with soldiers and myth creatures  > some graphical errors, but not a major con. it is after all an old game> NOT WORTH FULL PRICE AT ALL*I would recommend this game, but not at it`s full price. I feel like the features it has does not suit the $ 30 , if you are planning to get it I recommend getting it during a sale. It is fun, especially playing with friends and having to pretend to talk to the AI, they say some of the ugh.. stupidest things sometimes lol ""JUST SHUT UP CORNITH"" (god I hate Cornith lmao) The game is pretty basic too, collecting your basic rescources like wood, gold and food, building up your army to massacre other teams. One annoying thing is as soon as you take over a team you have to make sure to destroy their buildings and kill EVERY unit they might have. this is especially annoying due to the fact that sometimes they have one stupid fish boat swimmin' around somewhere in the ocean and you have no idea where it is. *Overall, I`d say this game is worth your time but not worth the full price!TL;DR : annoying wierd AI, really fun, basic game and ♥♥♥♥ you Cornith "

And I regret it.Problem: They messed up badly with the multiplayer network (Doesn't matter how fast your connection is and how beasty your computer is). Even if played via lan, the lag totally kills the fun,  and at least for myself and everyone I know, makes the multiplayer beyond frustrating.-If you intend to play the campaign and singleplayer ai skirmishes only,  go ahead and enjoy.   HOWEVER,-If you want to buy this for the MULTIPLAYER,  - DON'T BUY THIS!

												Age of Mythology: EE is a reprise of the oldschool AoM: Titans, incorporating many online features thanks to the Steam platform the game manages to come back to life easing out the task of playing with other players around the world which is always a refreshing thing to do when it comes to replaying really oldschool games.Graphically the improvs of the game aren't as shocking as the multiple previews we had through the years this was being announced, but its something, and its nice, decent.The game on its core is better balanced, and the gameplay has some nifty improvements to offer.The main issue is the performance. Somehow the game manages to run poorly on most systems, with huge frame drops, and the games unability to run from certain common graphic cards, and only from integrated graphics. Which drops the framerate and overall responsiveness even more. To the point that is actually hard to enjoy.Even if there aren't much changes graphically/gameplay wise to be called ""Extended Edition"" its a shame such cool online features are being hindered by the inability to correctly address the performance issues that were promised to be tackled since the launch itself.If you really enjoy RTS games, and you love AoM, and you're sure your system's performance will overcome the game issues then you will have a good time.Otherwise. Stay Away.			"

Though, these have existed before this ""extended edition""  The devs of this game seem non existant when it comes to resolving issues with this game, hell, I don't think there's been a single useful update for the game.

I can't launch a single player game at all, because theres some sort of bug in an expansion that I didn't buy currently corrupting the game I did buy. Its a tangled mess that frankly is beyond me. It sort of reminds me of what happens when a game thinks its been pirated. It'll let you run the game and then immeadietly before you start gameplay it shuts down and goes ""nope no play for you.""  From what I've seen on the reddit page not recieving many fixes and no one has an answer to the problem I'm facing. The Steam forum doesn't even exist because apperantly the devs deleted it so thats not sketchy as ♥♥♥♥.Once this game is fixed I'd most defiently recommend it, but I can't recommend it in its current form because their is no game right now. And If it turns out that I'm required to buy DLC to play the game I own then frankly thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the dev team should be ashamed of themselves.			"

Posted: November 29, 2015
												TL:DR version - I like age of mythology as a game, but this remake kind of sucks.TL:ohgawdwhyareyoustilltalking version...Alright, let's start with what makes age of mythology great! As a game, it's wonderful and has stood the test of time. You have a wide array of very different strategies and tactics you can use, the different races all feel substantially unique from one another, and you can pick various major and minor deities to worship which each tweak your play style to suit your individual preferences better!The units are fairly unique from one another, there's lots of interesting mythological things like giants, pegasi, sphinxes and so on, and the economic aspects are rather enjoyable as well, which is rare for a strategy game. For an example of the economic stuff, look to the egyptians who can have their pharoah empower a building to make it build faster or boost the resources given to it, or that the atlanteans carry carts with them so they don't have to wander all the way back to town to drop off resources.There's always sort of a rock/paper/scissors thing going on, and no one unit is overpowered... buuuuut. Ah, yeah, there's always a but isn't there? It's a big fat butt in this case. Several of them.Well, some of what I just mentioned isn't super accurate. A lot of the units are very, very similar with little difference at all other than their stats - special abilities are pretty much reserved for mythological units and the god powers can only be invoked once per game instead of on a cooldown so they're not that impressive most of the time. Generally speaking, your units may look different and be better tasks, but one soldier is pretty much the same as any other soldier, other than what they do bonus damage against.That's another issue... the ""balance"" of the game, if you can call it that, is kind of wonky. If you look to other strategy games, such as the blizzard games of warcraft 3 or starcraft 1 or 2, the difference between being ""good"" against another unit or ""bad"" is generally 150% normal damage vs 50% normal damage in return. It's a significant difference and makes it possible for masses of units to fight things they're not that good against so long as you severely outnumber them. In AoM... well, you get things like a x15 damage multiplier... it's kind of absurd. If you aren't fighting something you deal bonus damage to, you may as well not be fighting at all.This balance also has the problem that the ""rock, paper scissors"" moteif that AoM has going for it kind of breaks down with mythological units. Oh, you like your sphinxes? Too bad. Sure, they look big and strong, with much higher stats than normal infantry... but if the enemy has even a single hero, the bonus damage from heroes to myth units is so absurd that you may as well never bother making myth units. Especially against the greeks who have some of the most powerful and cheapest heroes which take forever to kill since nothing does bonus damage against heroes. The game claims normal infantry are the counter to heroes, but they really aren't.The AI and mechanics make turtling not an overly useful strategy as well - all, literally all defensive structures deal piercing damage, and siege weapons usually have 80-99% resistance to piercing. Walls are easily destroyed, and the AI just sends wave after wave after wave of the same small units over and over so you'll probably never be able to rebuild a wall once it's damaged, even with the silly fast building speed in the game. So if you like to turtle and just tech up for long periods of time, you're going to find it's a nuisance - not difficult, just annoying, especially since the AI tends to ignore military units to attack peasants mindlessly. You can work around those things, but it's irritating instead of fun.Still, the game is fun as a whole. There's no denying that. As strategy games go, even for the minor nuisances it has, it's still one of the best, and by far the best of the age of empires series by leaps and bounds over any other. Yeah, the game balance is a bit wonky, but it sorta kinda works still. Really, it's fun in a way that more serious games like starcraft aren't. Starcraft II has by far a better campaign mode, but honestly I'd say the skirmishes in AoM are vastly superior to the skirmishes in SC2 surprisingly enough, and I have a platinum rating on SC2 so make of that what you will.So if the game's still very fun after so many years... what's wrong with it? Why the downvote?Well... this version... sucks, to put it mildly.Example: do you have a computer that can run Evolve at 120FPS? Well expect to have dips below 10FPS on AoM.The ""new features"" are things that honestly have no real impact on the game. A tiny little mini campaign is kinda... nice I guess? But let's be honest, the vast bulk of a strategy game's lifespan and value comes from its skirmish mode which this doesn't change in the slightest. The day night cycle is... negligible, as is much of everything else.The glitches that are brought, such as crashes, freezing, framerate drops, and actually a significantly reduced AI kind of diminish the game. The original was better because it actually worked. This version... you've got a 50/50 chance of finishing a mission without it being finished for you by a glitch of some sort or another. These bugs have been around for over a year now, so don't expect them to ever get patched.The price point is also a major issue - I was annoyed enough as it was that AoM was still trying to charge $20 when it was a decade old. Then they came out with the ""extended"" version... and now they want over $35 for it. Yeaaaaaaaaaaahno. Get it on sale, but that's it.Actually, you know what? Buy AoM: extended edition on sale... and then download a hacked copy of the original after you've paid for this one, and play the hacked one instead because it's flat out going to play better than this. That's right, I just told you to pay for the game but play a hacked one. That should tell you something about the quality of the game - the game itself is fine, but this version isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Oh, it's a computer title. It's not printed on paper. Yeaaaah it's worth less than $0 as it is.Oh well.But I didn't get the chance to pay for AoM when it first came out years ago, and honestly, AoM as a game is worth paying for to encourage further development of games such as this. Seriously, support AoM:EE simply because if enough people do, maybe they'll make a sequel. Yeah, the extended edition sucks, yeah, it doesn't deserve your money, and yeah, a hacked version of the original is simply the better game... but AoM itself deserves a reward for existing, even if they dropped the ball on this one. Into the sewer. Sorry, I don't have hip waders, I'm not going to go dig it out of the slime and sewage.If you do, however, have the hip waders? It's a magnificient game beneath a veneer of crap, so if you can wash it off, it's well worth it. I just can't recommend this release is all. Even at -75% off.			"

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition as a real-time strategy game published by Microsoft. It is a perfected version of the old game Age of Mythology and Age of Mythology: The Titans.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition gameplay are pretty much the same as the old Age of Mythology and Age of Mythology: The Titans made into one game. In addition, the Golden Gift add on are also included in this remake. Unlike Age of Empires II: HD Edition, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition doesn't have population cap increase, everything in the gameplay stays the same. It's quite nostalgic to replay this old game with improved graphics, I remember almost all the god powers I used, the meteor rain, tornado, earthquake and more. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition also comes with Steam Cloud support and Steam Workshop support, which is a great addition into the game.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition however, have improved graphics than the old game. New improved global lightning, widescreen support, new water shaders and the new day and night cycle in skirmish play. It looks prettier now and more epic to play. With all these improved visuals, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition still retain its great performances and runs very great and smooth.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition exact same gameplay can be its good side or bad side for some people. But for me, it's very nostalgic and fun. I prefer this kind exact same gameplay rather than some of those next generation game with many promises which turn out to be a disappointment. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is indeed a great remake. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												It somehow manages to be worse than the original game.It really goes to show the lack of effort aswell as how broad the term ""Extended Edition"" or ""Graphical Remake"" has become.The extended content is apparantly steam intergration, a new campaign, day night cycles and achievements...The achievements just show the pinacle of laziness. ""Finish the campaign""""Win 10 games of Zeus""""Beat Zeus 10 times""""Win against 1 AI""""Win against 2 AI""etc etc. The titles aren't amusing (Like Postal or Magicka) , the objectives aren't creative and they are just a complete waste of time (More so than usual with achievements.)The extra missions are four campaign missions using assets already in the game, just to show that extra lack of effort.Somehow the AI has gotten worse since the original version. I saw a computer team that had a titan and an army to be feared (On titan difficulty) surrender after they lost one oracle. Right after, I battled another town with similar forces, I lost the battle and yet they surrendered.Have they added any new units... noHave they added anything noteworthy...noDoes the game deserve the title Extended Edition...noIf you love the original then you will tolerate this... but it is nowhere near deserving og a price tag at £23...P.s The day night cycle is♥♥♥♥♥♥..

												There are many features which make the game great. I'm gonna name a few:- beautiful randomly generated maps. You can learn everything you need to know about the maps in 2 hours, but even after 30 days of playing they will still surprise you.- the playable cultures excel with their diversity and fascinating mythology. Unleash terrifying mythical brutes such as the einherjer which will tear your enemies apart.- Advancing on the map with your siege army and military camps adds a lot to the 'all out war' feeling to the game.- The soundtrack, the graphics and the overall design make for a true atmospheric environment.Age of Mythology was the game that initally ignited my passion for online games. It's hard for me to be objective, because I share so many glorius childhood memories with this classic jewel. The main reason I bought the extended edition for steam were simple: The game hasn't aged and they gave access to online-playing. The former AoM servers were unfortunately shut down which was a huge bummer at the time. "

												First i'd like to say that i really enjoy the game. But there are way too much bugs introduced (and kept) by the extended edition so the main part of my review while be about them.BUGS:There may be less serious ones like a magical box appearing with the letters ""Message Text goes here"". And there are more annoying ones like reset of settings on start (i posted a fix in the support forum - the thread was only over a year old). And there are real♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs like the memory bug (full crash of game) which appears to exist since years.(extended edition didnt fix it ofc). Another Bug in the Tutorial - meaning i had to restart the mission. And right into the next one one while playing one of the first 3 Missions - having to restart the mission again too. Lets not forget the horrendus performance - even with all graphic features disabled the game needs way too much power for being this old. On the pro-side we got a twitch integration now. *insert sarcastic YAY here* Also while all the bugs are still there since years a new expansion pack is announced.... So while i leave a negative review here - i can really recommend this game for old times sake if it is going cheap in the sale.			"

												THIS is a review of the ""Extended Edition"" not the original Age of Mythology.    Age of Mythology: Extended Edition has minor improvements and major issues compared to the original game. The whole thing...it's not even close to a rework. Why would you make a reboot of a 12 years old game and still not make any major changes except the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ water? The only things that are new are some trading cards and twitch integration that has no point in this game. Why not? Well, it's because the multiplayer is barely playable due to the massive lag in any kind of server. Even when it says it has 50 ping. What impressed me was that I had read about a guy complaining about lag in LAN! Can you believe this? The developers - Skybox Labs just ruined the whole conception of gameplay in the Extended Edition.  Do you know what else is arrogant about the game? The price. Who would pay 28 (I can even say 30) euro for poorly developed reboot of a 12 years old game? It's worse than the original one which is much better and even cheaper.   Aside from the horrible reboot, Age of Mythology is a great game. It's a RTS game with the similar gameplay of Age of Empires. The game can be very competitive as almost every RTS game and the gameplay is amazing. The campaign mode has an interesting story with almost every element of the mythology. The game was my childhood game and I love it but I deny anything good in the Extended Edition since it's only playable vs bots.   Don't waste that much money on a reboot. It's even slowly dying every day after people saw what a tragedy it is. From top 100 games in steam on the release in the 7-8 place, it got kicked from the chart with thousands of people dissapointed. "

												At the current game state (as of 10/05/2014), the game handles like a donkey with broken legs; total trash. For (what seems to be) the majority of players, the game handles and runs poorly. Constant lagging, freezing and hanging that slows down the PC as a whole and can cause it to lock up.I've tried many things for numerous hours to try and get this classic RTS to work. To name a few,XP Compatibility, Admin mode, trouble-shooting with all sorts of options and settings in-game and in steam, folder read/write permission/rights, defragging, PC cleaning (registry files for example) and nothing made a difference. Sometimes right away or a couple minutes (at best) after I launch the game, the lag started and it just got worse and worse to the point where my whole PC would freeze up and I'd need to manually terminate the game exe' file through the Task Manager.Bitter I may sound, and disappointed I am. I do not recommend purchasing this game as of yet. Perhaps (and hopefully) the game will be patched and fixed in the future. But as of yet; it isn't worth the gamble to see if you're part of the minority that can run the game just fine.			"

												A good game, but I knew that already. Problem is how they really overcharge for it and when you see the huge problem this game still has, you just cant recommend it. - Constant lag when playing with friends- What was made to ""optimize the game"" is barely noticable, minor, or useless- Nothing was made to improve the AI. What I mean by that is that on certain maps, such as waterhole or Tundra, the AI wont gather any ressources nor will it build an army, often times because its too brain dead to find food, making for really annoying games when you spend 10 minutes building a base only to realise the AI's gathererer are all frozen when there are goats, gold mines and wood nearby.- Bad DLC's, stale, boring, complete cash grab with a stupidly high price tag attached on it. - Price is REALLY high for such an old game, probably one of the worst quality/price games on steam. When you find other older & better games for 10$, they better improve the original, which they really do notBuy it on a sale if youre feeling Nolstalgic. Otherwise, i suggest you pass this game			"

												Thats the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HD remaster that could be made on planet Earth in XXI century.Remembering the first days ef ""enjoyin"" acidic graphics and horrible lags and freezes , i dont believe that fixing this took about a year. And even now some of this problems may occur in the game. Srsly? The old version from 2004 works fine even on modern machines and in high resolutions, how it could be so hard to make an HD remaster of game, that supports HD??Chinese expansion made things even worse. All new units and buldings are retextured models from other races. They didnt even tried to make a new set of animations. Walking huge baboon? Big crocodile? Is this a joke? WHY ON EARTH YOU MADE A CAMPAIGN WITH IN-GAME EDITOR AND DIDNT EVEN TESTED IT? It skips missions, music is too loud (or voices are too quiet). Shennong is bugged as hell, most units are missing some scripts and standind like dummies. Chinese in multiplayer are imbalanced, new units requires too much rebalancing, is that a problem to make a closed beta-test or stop making empty promises?Never, NEVER buy a game made by this company. Enjoy older versions, they are working perfect even nowadays.			"

												Three trolls, four golden battle boars and a pack of wolves have just devastated the last of Thor's town centres, and my gatherers have already moved in to take over their farming network. I am Odin, and my thunder god son had the audacity to attack me during the opening 30 minutes of this random map skirmish.The ludicrousness of this scenario, as mythical creatures of various origins trundle in over peaceful farmland to murder everyone in sight, was Mythology's strength over Ensemble's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings when it was released in 2002. Mythology's colourful range of high-level fantasy creatures make the final act of any skirmish much more exciting than units of historical repute did in Age of Kings. Kraken trouble the seas, dragon-like nidhoggs circle the skies and hydra grow a head for every enemy they slay.Age of Mythology does feel antiquated, but it is still a lot of fun. It wasn't a notably innovative RTS at release, mostly built on '90s ideas, but it did take Ensemble's blend of Civ-style city management and more conventional military RTS ideas to its creative peak, as well as making the series fully 3D for the first time.The upgraded effects of the Extended Edition, most noticeably the shiny-looking water, help contemporise Mythology, but the character models are the strongest signs that this is a decade-old game. AI is a bit of an issue, too. On a moderate difficulty, the enemies attack predictably in medium-sized waves while rarely putting up an overwhelming defence of their own territories.I don't hold that against Mythology, though, because it is still cathartic to steamroll the AI on random maps. The online multiplayer, too, means you won't be short on smarter opponents, and it seems to be running well, even if the process of finding a game you can join feels a bit arduous.The Extended Edition isn't short on single-player content, either. Collected here are the Titans expansion and the shorter Golden Gift DLC campaign, in addition to the original's mammoth story mode.Each campaign level is prefaced by in-engine cutscenes of hilariously low production values. Voice acting sounds like the product of three almost-drunk friends being handed the keys to a recording studio for an afternoon. This shortfall is probably another sign of its age and the industry standard of the time, but otherwise I think this is one of the better RTS campaigns of its day in the variety of the mission structure.You rarely feel like you're doing the exact same thing twice, and the parameters can change from survival to deathmatches and surprise ambushes. The impressively in-depth Scenario Editor helps to extend the singleplayer's lifespan, and with Workshop support, there's no fear of running dry of stuff to do.Age of Mythology still has a lot of value beyond nostalgia.This isn't a total remake, so don't go in expecting one. The Extended Edition is still a really well-paced and entertaining RTS, one that revels in over-the-top imagery and remains a one-off in subject matter within the oeuvre of the sadly departed Ensemble.

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a good example of a poorly made cash grab.The Extended tag probably means the new bugs Skybox Labs managed to produce, that didn't exist in the original.The AI pathfinding is messed up. Units often phase/clip through the walls and villagers often get stuck in larger buildings (Temple, Wonder, Titan Gate) they have finished building.The changes to the graphics are highly questionable. The new textures are washed out and blurry, so it's highly recommended to revert them to something that looks closer to the original (EG: Epic textures mod). Otherwise you will have a hard time finding your units, as they blend into the environment too well. Last but not least the netcode. Oh, boy! If you thought Age of Empires 2 HD's netcode was bad, then you have no idea what this game has in store for you. The online matches are insane lagfests, often freezing up for  seconds, rendering the game unplayable.Bottom line is that this version of the game is a mess. Skip it, you're not missing out much!

												The hours played on Steam pale greatly with the amount of hours I have put into this game. Still owning it in a hard copy...This is one of those games I always come back to.Not because the story is any good, it's the equivalent of a Hercules or Xena episode.Not because the gameplay is revolutionary.Not because of cutting edge graphics...So why?It's fun.It allows us to interact with myths and mythology in a way that's surprisingly rare.It is an RTS with a solid base building mechanic.The factions are unique from one another with those factions being further seperated by a multitude of minor god selections which help diversify and specialize your force.The game mostly works (in a generally) on a rock/paper/scissors mechanic...with mythological units (like a Minotaur or a Sphinx) eat up basic normal units, your hero units (say an egyptian pharaoh or Hercules) beat myth units and your basic normal human units beat hero units.The game does have its faults. Obviously the graphics aren't the best. The story is below average, the base building mechanics are from another time but you get to have Hercules knocking around giants while on another part of the map a sphinx unit spins to win on a structure.As with most games I'll recommend, snag it on sale but ultimately I suggest you give it a chance.

Uncreative units and myth units, no new or interesting mechanics (hurr gardens = smaller plenty vaults! we even stole the plenty vault icon!!!), and random defeats/crashes/glitches galore.Also the single player campaign sucks. A lot.The art is good, though. And the music is good, when it plays for about 15 seconds and then leads into the standard AoM music. Oh well, the classics are still great anyway.Worst of all, and here's why I implore you to download this game from a torrent site, the game forces you to have the latest DLC to play the game. It will literally boot you from a SINGLE-PLAYER GAME because it detects Chinese units when you don't have the DLC.			"

The buildings are well done along with the story. The AI can seem a bit broken at times, but it\'s way nicer than Age of Empires AI, so that\'s a sight to see. Though there are parts that can get rather boring, it makes up for it with quick-play matches, and even a multiplayer system. The units are very ranged and it\'s interesting when you play as different groups like Nords, Egyptians, Greeks, etc. The system is very easy to learn and understand so even if you\'re new to these kind of games it\'s nothing to be scared of. Overall, a good strategy game.			"

												Easily, the version in the early 00's had me clock in hundreds of hours.  When i heard about the re-release, I was stoked. So the 40 i originally spent, plus 20 for the titans,back in 00's, was worth it, but unfortunately, this 24 dollars I paid (on sale) is about 20 dollars more then it should have been.   The performance is awful, and it literally looks the exact same, other then the lighting effects (which inevitably need to be turned off to get framerates of 40+.    all the icons, are ported and super - lo- res. the UI and menu actually looks worse, I can even see the slim ""border""  on the text layout.Gameplay is as I remember.And for what its worth, the game doesnt have any network issues, which was the main thing that was broke in the first game.This game is worth about 5 bucks,  and anyone that purchases this game for any more is just supporting this ""cash-grab"" philosophy most game companies take to already succesful games, and throw a new name on it with no new content or polish.

												I used to think this was a nice improvement, but after a 100 hours and comparing with the original I have a few things to say.The game looks nice, but at the same time, non of the units were improved and the terain got dark and ugly after a while. Then it started to show that because of a lack of improvements in certain areas, the game looks worse because there is a beatiful shadow on the ground of a pixelated tree.Now this I would have overlooked, was it not for the fact that they also tampered with the game in terms of pricing and new units, and the God awful expansion which starred a huge baby gnome as the ""Titan of the Chinese"". The expansion gets in your face if you don't own it since there are some balance changes to accomodate it. Yet there  are no balance changes to the fact that Zeus will defenestrate your buildings like no tomorrow, or the fact that the atlanteans are all unbalanced as Britains Pound right now.But yet, I would overlook this. For these things are things I could live with if only I had a multiplayer that actually worked. And ofcourse, no it doesn't. Frequent desync issues, people randomly getting thrown out of games and general latency issues plague the multiplayer. Almost nobody plays the game multiplayer anymore anyway.It was here when I became desperate for some AOM, so I played tutorial and fought things in skirmishes. It was all fine and dandy, until I loaded up Acropolis and found to my horror that all the plateaus had gaps in the clif faces which completely ruined one of my favourite maps. I then started up the origional and played one skirmish game and it felt like I was playing Age of Mythology again. No lag, no weird shadows, no weird inconsistencies in graphical quality, no weird streched out faces, no weird skewed camera in cutscenes. Most of all it ran buttery smooth, so much so that I was supprised at how well I could actually play. I did the same thing as I normally but this time I turned out to have improved. My conclusion is that this is only worth it if you want to play with friends abroad and want an official way to do so, and don't mind any conectivity issues. This by no means is a good replacement for Age of Mythology, a game which worked fine but had some flaws. These issues are why I can't recommend this game as a replacement.			"

												Buy this game when it is on sale and you will be very pleased. It is not noticeably different from the game that was released many years ago, which is exactly what I was looking for so I was quite pleased. There are so many gods and strategies to choose from that it will keep you very well occupied.			"

												Short version - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, even if you used to be a fan. The amateur developers have completely destabilized and destroyed the game.Long version - I've never written a review before, but my recent experience with Age of Mythology has driven me to it.Let me start out by saying that I've been playing this game since it originally came out and I've loved it the whole time. The campaign is incredible, the graphics are great for their time, and the strategy gameplay is the best I've ever seen. It's rare not to get bored of a game after playing it for 14 years, and I'd go as far as saying that AOM is my favourite game of all time.The old AOM that is... Recently a set of wannabe developers have released DLC that is absolute crap, or at least that's what I've read in reviews, which is why I haven't bought the DLC. I figured I just wouldn't buy it and continue to enjoy the same game that I've enjoyed for years.Of course, the old AOM had some bugs, but they were minor and the game was stable over all. Everything was fine until the fascist developers of this new DLC started screwing around with the original game! They've removed some technologies and units and added new ones, they've reskinned some things (and did a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job), and they've introduced a ton of bugs to the gameplay. For example, god powers show up in the area for researching upgrades when you click on buildings like the wall and temple, technologies that you research show up in the wrong buildings or not at all, and when you drag to select units, the bottom area of the screen which shows who and what you selected either shows the wrong number of units, the wrong units, or nothing at all.I paid to get the original Age of Mythology and the Steam version worked fine before, but the bugs these ameteurs introduced have turned the game into a steaming pile of you-know-what. If you want to add units and other new content, that's fine. Release it as a mod so that when people install it and it completely destroys the game, it's their fault they ruined it and not yours.To summarise, even if you are a fan of the old AOM, don't buy this game, because sadly it's not the game you played back in the day. I really hope the developers get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and stop ruining this classic.			"

												Good ol' age of mythology that I used to play back in the dayYou would think in 2014 a game like this in multiplayer would be without problems..but then again here we go, back in 2005 I don't ever remember lagging, matter fact most games would run smooth, but good god steam AOM multiplayer takes it to a whole level. It literally feels like steam gave aom multiplayer parkinsons desease, The muliplayer doesnt care if everyone is running FIOS 5million gigbait internet it will lagg, it will be jerky through out the entire game, this is just plain ♥♥♥♥in sad. I dont even use steam but certain games i could only get on steam so i was forced to use this program, also with workshop integration i looked forward to an already good exprience being better, i was expecting steam to get things right that the original game versions did not,,,,but it didnt. I was dissapointed.The stats do not lieWhy is it that >90% of the players that play this game on steam dont play multiplayer?The chat lobby is glitchythe game lobbies are glitchymost original good scenarios are unplayableI'll continue playing just cause i love AOM so much, but i will not be advocating getting it on steam.People still play using the original CD's and the servers are still up, old problems persist but alteast microsoft didnt give their version parkinsons.

												I LOVED age of mythology as a kid.  It was one of my favorite games.  The opportunity to play a new and improved version on steam when it was on sale for $7.49 was too much to pass up.Unfortunately however this game is one of the buggiest and most poorly optimized games I have ever played.  It's multiplayer segment, even LAN, is borderline unplayable in its current state due to absurd lag and desync crashes.  A quick glance around the forums reveals that this is not an issue with my system, everyone is having these issues.  It has been over a year since the game has been released.  It should not still be having these issues.  There has been no communication between the developers and the games community over these issues so it looks like they won't be fixed anytime soon.  It pains me to have to leave this review, it really does.  It's so bad that I'm requesting a refund from steam.			"

												Major multiplayer lag across all games on official day of release. I expected at least some testing within the long 2-month lapse of the early copies already being handed out. Mostly good, like the original, but the amount of additions to this game is equivalent to the amount of bugs. Of course, I am no official tester, so I am not leaving a list behind me. However, I will say that there is UNBAREABLE lag in multiplayer games (stutter-lag), and I have extensively played the original well enough to know that neither my internet connection nor computer would be causing such. Timers (wonder, settlement, triggered) are all away from the edge by a long shot, making it look way out of position. Also, some textures look too unrealistic with this lightning overlay, such as the Tartarian Gate.These results were briefly acquired from just three games. I do still 'recommend' the game, but only because people like the ORIGINAL game (pretty much this) and I am expecting bug fixes soon.9.5/10 original game (balance lack),6/10 remake-EDIT: two days later, I changed the recommendation to NOT due to virtually no balancing or testing prior to releasing game. no bug fixes			"

Posted: December 24, 2016
												I got this game on 12/22/2016. After reading the numerous reviews about how I should not buy this game and play aom on voobly instead, I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway since I love aom (1800 rr back in 07' ;) ). I suppose I just was not satisfied because the reviews did not actually go into detail about anything that I thought was important. I am going to do my best, though, to give you the details of how terribly disappointing this game has been for me for the past couple days, even though I don't tend to give bad reviews because I don't like hurting other people's businesses, However, I consider this game a scam.I'm going to start with the China campaign, since that's where I started. The first issue arose when I restarted the first scenario, since I was kinda screwing around with looking at the new units and the AI got ahead of me. When I restarted, I was astonished to find that I was in the Archaic Age, rather than the Classical Age, like I had been in the game before. In addition, once I collected 400 food and built my first temple, I could not even advance to the Classical Age. Therefore, I was stuck trying to fight the AI with immortals from my town center, which was basically impossible once they started sending in human units. I restarted again and again, but could not resolve the issue. I decided to finally restart the whole game and wait out the cinematic all the way through again, and I finally got the game to start in the Classical Age. I can't say for sure that this bug exists within the game or if there is an issue with my computer. However, I reinstalled a fresh version of windows 8.1 about a week ago and there's basically nothing on my computer, so if it's a problem with my computer, then that's really a problem with poor compatability caused by the developers. The other possibility is it could be an issue caused by the Ekanta user interface mod that I dowloaded for, and I actually haven't tested that yet. However, Ekanta is a popular UI and I would be surprised if no one figured that out yet. After beating the first and the second scenarios, I got to the third, when I discovered that I once again could not advance to the classical age, despite having a temple and 400 food. I thought that this possibly could be like the original AOM campaign, which don't let you advance (although the option doesn't even show up for those), but was once again flooded by human units and forced to fight with the only unit I could make, which were immortals from my town center. This time I restarted and restarted and no matter what could not begin in whatever age i was supposed to, or resolve whatever the issue was this time. However, i couldn't advance, and did the only thing I could which was build my TC and either THRILL OF VICTORY, or spam O CANADA bears (recommend the O CANADA's if you run into this issue). I can't remember the order of the campaign past this because I just wanted to get it over with. Another one of the scenarios (there are only like 9 of these but they are almost all terrible) has you fight off an army. This time, when I restarted I discovered that my troops went from having heavy upgrades to having no upgrades. This bug has an easy fix, though, If you just restart and wait for part of the cinematic to finish before skipping; then your troops will once again be heavily armored. The final bug with the campaign that I ran into so far was once again that I could not age on another scenario, this time after building an armory since I actually started in the Classical Age. I was eventually able to beat the AI's champion, fully upgraded units with my clasical units after mixing in some monkey king myth units. So that ends most of what I want to say about the campaign. The final issue I want to bring up comes from watching a streamer play as thor against a chinese player in a 1v1. Once he got to the mythic age, he discovered that he mentioned that he had no units that could counter cataphract, which are Chinese counter-infantry cavalry, without also being countered by the cataphract themselves. Norse does not have an archer or a cavalry unit which counters cavalry, which would be the only two options, unless using myth units. Thanks for reading and please don't buy this game!			"

As much as I loved the original, the extended edition is buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ In multiple ocassions, I've had units get stuck inside terrain, trees or otherwise stuck and unable to move. Also fishing boats sometimes won't return gathered food to the dock, and the only way to fix that is to rebuild the docks. Bugs aside, it hasn't aged particularly well and the extended edition doesn't seem to be doing very much to improve anything.It's a good thing they're still bringing out updates, but they've still got a long way to go.

												I LOVE AOE. Played it religiously when I was a kid. That is why it is so hard to give this a no in reccomendation. To be brief:The devs of this rerelease do not give a crap. On some PCs the game won't launch despite numerous user attempts to fix it, it simply won't launch. From countless posts on forums this has been a problem ever since this rerelease was.. released. Yet it has not been addressed and many players aren't even able to play the damn game.There are a number of ridiculous bugs that were not present in the original game that appear present here. The most annoying and angering one is enemy units sometimes being able to glitch through your walls making them useless. I could ignore all this and not even bother with the ""no"" reccomendation if they hadn't rubbed salt in the wound - I was livid to see these useless devs have released ""DLC"" for this poorly coded game for things that are not DLC worthy!!! For example, to play on a ""giant"" sized map you need to buy the DLC whereas in the orginal this was always available. THEY WANT YOU TO PAY MONEY TO PLAY ON A BIGGER SIZED ORIGINAL MAP. There are a number of new maps with the DLC, which is great! But guess what, I don't want new maps, I want to be able to play as I did before without having to give you MORE money just to upgrade the map size. It is a very basic thing thing that they are using to shill money out of people.There are worse devs, but these devs have particularly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off because of how much I loved this game when I was younger. I get all rereleases are money grabbers, but at least have some dignity about it. This is shameful. "

												AoM is very similar in the way that it plays compared to Age of Empire, and that's not a bad thing either since it plays very very well.There is a huge amount of content available which will keep anyone entertained for probably ~100 hours, if not more. I have managed to power through the campaign in about seven hours, partly because I played this game to death when I was younger.I haven't tried the multi-player out, and I suspect it will now be even more polished than before. This is a really strategy gamer's dream. Go out and buy  Age of Mythology, you will not be disappointed.			"

												I was a bit hesitant to buy this game. It has quite a BIG pricetag, especially keeping in mind that it's a 2002 game. A few months after release a sale came, I took a deep breath and bought the game. I have to admit I was quite surprised and astonished. Despite all the bad critiques the remake is getting the game works like a charm. The visuals are beautiful, the gameplay is fluid and bug free. Even though there are known performance-eaters like SSAO and FXAA/BLOOM added to the game Age of Mythology still runs like what you'd expect from a 2002 game, except with better graphics. I'd put it between AOE HD (which looks horrid in my opinion, despite the ""HD"" tag) and AOE III.However the looks aren't everything.Gameplay-wise (surprisingly) it's very much like the Age of Empires games, you can plow through several campaigns which mainly consists of gathering supplies, building a city (or two), fending off smaller enemy attacks, garrisoning a huge army and then defeating the enemy. It's a bit like Civilization on a more smaller ""local"" scale. However the main difference from the Age of Empires games is the addition of:- Epic Gods- Magic powers- Kickass monsters, mythological creatures to add to your army!The workshop is filled with great content, great texture pags to further enhance the looks of the game, small fixes and additions to the UI etc. The integration of the mods into the game is seamless. I heard that it also has a great mod development kit (I haven't tried it yet). Probably the only negative thing about the game is that many people are having issues with the multiplayer, server lag. I like playing strategy games at my own pace so I can't reinforce these criticisms, I haven't tried the multiplayer.To keep a long story short I think the developers really added extra ""oomph"" to an old classic spicing it up enough to be appealing even after 12 years. It's really up to you if you think the price-tag (which I admit is quite thick) is justifiable or you'll wait for it to go on a sale like I did. Right after I bought this game I played four hours straight without even noticing the time. I think that's enough recommendation, especially today when we (including me) just hoard up dozens of games without even trying them.			"

												Currently extremely disappointed! Worst $30 I've spent for a game I currently still own on disc from original launch and know that I love to play. Within my first 2 games of online play, which is the only reason I re-purchased this game for the steep price of $30, I cannot even play. Literally. Can. Not. Play. The lag is terrible, horrible, pathetic. Freezing for 5 seconds at a time, every 20 seconds. Both games I played stalled out at locked screens forcing a resign. I will be honest that I don't know the source of this lag, but I can conclude and deduce that it isn't Steam and it definitely isn't on my end (isp/pc/graphics). For someone that is re-purchasing this game because I already know it's great, it's sad that this issue isn't already fixed on a game that is so old. The main audience you that is thrilled to play this would be that such as myself, returning for the glory days of this game when it was one of the best. Get yourself together. This is a disgrace to a game as good as this is. If this was fixed I would recommend AoM in a heartbeat, but for now, don't waste your time or money if you want to play with other people online. If I wanted to play solo I would pop in my AoM disc and be happy. But in this day and age of online gaming in the Steam multiplayer community, there is no excuse for this.			"

												Flushing $30 would be more productive then spending money on this terrible remake of a great game.  Super laggy and absolutely no support for bug fixes.  Examples of horrendous code:  One game started with a teammate that had a pond in place of where his town center should have been and therefore he started the game defeated!  Another time I was playing 1 vs 1 against the AI and after the game I saw that my opponent was only given 1 town center compared to my 3!  Several other times the AI has been known to do nothing after 2-3 minutes into the game as if they forget how to gain resources and advance ages.  I also have a problem where my mouse cursor thinks it is on my desktop when hovering over portions of a map which makes the game unplayable.  I can fix that error by using Alt-Enter twice to go to window-mode and back again.  However, if I repeat this process again (due to the error recurring), the entire game crashes...  The sad part is many people would play this game if any effort was made to correct these errors.			"

												Age of Mythology is Real Time Strategy game that has managed to achieve the rare aspect of balance in its gameplay. Picking and sticking to an 'overpowered god' from the start is not really possible, as gods are very much rock-paper-scissors with each other. You can pick a certain god that counters the Norse (Gaia, for example) which would be destroyed by the Greek. You do get the feeling as you go along that certain Gods have better abilities than others, although I feel this is largely down to personal perference. Loki for example, has the ability for his Hersirs to randomly spawn Myth units into the battle, which maybe considered 'OP' by those who are in a militaristic war against them. BUT, Hersirs are very weak to arrows. Gather a few archers and you're back in the game. But then they can build calvary. But then you can build spearmen, and it continues.In terms of units, there isn't that much variety however it is not necessarily the units that you pick, but how you build the groups. When playing as the Greeks, two horseman, two archers and two infantry will survive longer than six archers.I played this game many years ago and am happy to see it make a HD relaunch, however honestly there really isn't much difference. My main 'pet peeve' with this game is the online play which, to be brutally honest, frustrates me to no end. There are three aspects which irritate me, those being; 1) Sync errors. You can be 40 minutes into a game and you will suddenly get a pop up saying 'Saving: Sync Error' which is an 'oh ****' moment. Your 40 minutes is now worthless, as you will now be back at the Main Menu screen. What a waste of time. They offer no explanation, no 'just kick the out-synced player', EVERYONE is put back to the Main Menu with nothing to show for the last 40 minutes. Oh, and did I mention that some players use programs to force sync errors if they are losing? Yeah.2) There's no option to vote-kick players midgame. The only option you have to kick a player is when they're about to disconnect, at which point the ENTIRE game comes to a halt for 30 seconds while you all vote. The voting, by the way, is pointless. Regardless of which option you pick (Continue or Wait) you will be forced to wait the full 30 seconds, even if the vote in unanimous.3) The program itself. The program itself can randomly just shut down. You can be destroying the entire map and then your game will just suddenly shut down with no warning as if you've pressed Alt + F4. Besides the above GLARING technical errors that I am in absolute disbelief haven't been fixed after x years since the game's release, the gameplay is actually very good. This is one of the most played, soon to be the most played game in my library. I would recommend, but I wish they'd sort out the gaping holes in their ship.			"

												One of my favourite games from my childhood. A friend got me into it , loved the original.As you expect i got excited when this came out on steam, too bad this remaster is full of bugs and has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. In single player games it kinda stutters alot even if i have 300 fps. And online its even worse its VERY laggy impossible to play because of blatant servers. If u want to play this game get the original version and go on Voobly or Game Ranger. This Extended Edition is a joke don't waste your money on it.The majority of positive apvotes are probably from people who only play campaing.			"

												Aah, Age of MythologyI've played this game since I was 9 years old. I could remember the first time I put in the CD and saw the game I would play the next 4 years. I loved it, played it for days, alone and with friends. Until I lost the CD. 2 Years after the loss I met Steam, and saw that they made the Extended Edition. So, like I always do, waited until christmas and bought it in the Winter Sale. And all the memories came back to me, and started playing it again. And apparently I never stopped loving this game. Every time I click on the PLAY button I still feel the memories coming back to me.10/10 wouldn't forget the background music again.			"

You may get it and play offline, or as I do and play with a  friend online. You will encounter many problems though (online) and you will pay money for something that is ''remade'' for the 3rd or + time now... Frustrating business making moves by microsoft destroy the progress of RTS these days, and there is no AOM 2 coming by any chance (official microsoft statement after a request i made via email).

												Let me put it this way, I already had this game, I already loved this game and I had played it for more than 300 hours, so when I saw that this edition was going to be available on Steam I loved it, but oh boy I was wrong. I basically bought this, at 40$, rather expensive game to play MULTIPLAYER which was the only option not available with my old AoM game, and the multiplayer of this game is one of the worst I've ever ever seen. It lags, it fails to connect and it is unplayable, even when trying to play with people within my same city it was completelly impossible. So, I would highly recommend you NOT TO BUY THIS GAME since the best word to describe it begins with ""S"" finishes with ""t"" and it isn't Suit.			"

												I have spent an overwhelming time playing Age of Mythology back in the disk form years ago. I was overly hyped to see that Steam was picking up AOM considering I lost the disk some time ago. Let's go over the game, shall we?(This will be solely based off of Age of Mythology itself, rather than any updates or such done by the Extended Edition.)Campaign32 levels, 3 different factions, interesting heroes and a compelling story. Barely any levels are the same, with each being unique and exciting. While a few (and I mean a very few) are a tad bland, that should be no reason to turn someone away from it. Not to mention the Atlantis campaign, which adds 12 more levels to play on with another new story and heroes tying to the first campaign in many ways.SkirmishWhen playing skirmish, the game provides a fun and (admittedly slightly repetative) experience to better oneself before possibly attempting multiplayer or the campaign on a harder difficulty. The player can choose any of the factions and their respective gods, giving a nice plethora of play styles. I do recommend keeping away from the ""Titan"" difficulty, however, as the AI gains a lot of handicaps.MultiplayerOh boy, multiplayer. I've seen a lot of great things from it. New maps, game mods, (usually) differing play styles from other players. It offers a good zone for both new players and pros, but I do recommend avoiding many ranked matches unless you're at the top of your game, because trust me, the other player almost always is. It's a great way to spice things up if you've beaten the campaign and are tired of the AI in skirmishes.Extended Edition + China DLCThe extended edition and China DLC are honestly... Disappointing. I'd say avoid the China DLC unless you're dying for new content so badly you'd do anything for it (which I'd even recommend the workshop before the DLC). The Chinese army is very gimmicky, and everything feels reused, with little, if anything, being brand new. It's also rather buggy. I, myself, haven't even beat the campaign yet, it's just bland and boring. The Extended edition tried to amp up textures and such, but it makes some things ugly and unappealing, and I highly recommend getting a mod or two to fix these up.All in all, I say buy this game, be it the disc or the Steam version, avoid the China DLC and game on. You won't be disappointed!			"

												Edited (July): I bought the expansion in the summer sale and the game is working fine now.I haven't been able to play a game since yesterday's update; it aways crashes in the beginning with an error report about Chinese villagers. Now, I haven't bought the expansion, so the Chinese should be irrelevant for me in the game. But, just like the Dragon expansion maps (which show in-game only for the game to tell you that you have to spend extra money to actually be able to play them), they have found a way to bug me.Oh, also, ""Giant"" map size shows in-game, but it's only available if I pay more money than I paid for the game in the first place? Not cool. Not cool at all. I think I'll look for a different game to play.			"

But an BS happened, when you let your enemy random it might call out an chinese major god. I was like well i'm ok with that. I don't plan playing with it but against it is not a big deal.But the the ultimate BS appears. It kicks me from the game(ON SINGLE PLAYER) saying that since i do not have the DLC purchased i therefore cannot continue. WTF are you guys thinking? so why did you added all this BS into my computer anyway in the first place. It used to be good but now its just a more power requirement from the original AOE with DLCs that gimps performance.			"

												FOR THE RECORD; Most of the negative reviews on the game aren't due to the actual mechanics and gameplay, but more to do with the terrible pricing, and the poor online netcode. If you're wanting to buy this game, DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM. Or at least wait until it's on a massive discount. Or better yet, buy a retail copy. That's the short version.Now, about the game. It's Age of Mythology. Which means it's a classic. Nuff said. The campaign is still amazing and holds up very well. The extended edition includes the Titans expansion which includes the Atlantean race, and the patched in content 'The Golden Gift' campaign. It's important to remember however that the campaign is also there to get you acquainted with the multiplayer mechanics.The multiplayer is ok, but the Netcode is wack. Lag is inevitable, and the only people who play the MP now are either vets from the original retail version who will wreck your sh**, or the odd random. My advice. Buy the game for the excellent singleplayer, and maybe jump online with a friend and get to grips with the unit intricacies, then have a go. PRO's:•	HD textures (not really noticeable) •	Excellent campaigns•	Solid balancing•	ClassicCon's:•	Dev's have abandoned the game. Horrific follow on development•	Multiple glitiches in MP. Also crashes sometimes•	AI is stupid as hell•	Insane asking priceConclusion: In my opinion, at this time the game isn't worth the Steam asking price. If you're willing to pay however, you'll have access to 3 campaigns, an editor, MP with all races, and skirmishes. All with a few HD textures. If you're not short of a few quid, you could do a lot worse than this. Pick it up if you want to try out more RTS outside of StarCraft.			"

												This game  I owned 14 or 15 years ago and loved it. For it's time and even now its storyline, gameplay and graphics are still quite good. What it definitely gets right is it doesn't just take the basics of mythology and used the same tired old tropes. It uses all manner of characters, creatures and phenomena from the 3 Civilizations and even for me some that I weren't even aware existed. You can tell alot of research and alot of thought went into this game.- Pros -  - Relatively good graphics considering how old the game is.- Nice music- Good storyline- wide variety of characters and creatures- Creative ""god powers""- many hours of play time (is not a short game)- really, really good tools for making your own map/scenario- Each Civilization has their own unique way of generating favour with the gods- Cons -- You can for the most part train a bunch of myth units that are more effective than most regular units to fight with and win- Enemy AI seemingly uses the same tactic almost every time, using small harassing skirmishes of 8-10 units at a time (at least on easy difficulty)- Seemingly the best way to give yourself a chance at winning is build as many walls and towers as you can and order your troops into defensive stance so they dont split up chasing every enemy unit they see all around the map and then dying.All in all though this game is fantasic and if you had any kind of love of Mythology before this can do nothing but rekindle it and maybe even make you want to do some reading on your favourite characters/creatures. I highly recommend this game. :)8.5/10Also a nice comedic bonus is watching a Cyclops use the special attack of picking up a humanunit and throwing it (probably) to it's death is pretty damn amusing as well. :)			"

This is the dumbest error ever and has been there since the non-steam version of Age of Mythology. You can expect to play an hour game and get desynced without finishing it.			"

												Very good game , best strategy game ever.The problem is that the game is so Fu$#@% buged that you can't play it online.More than 50% of the online games get desync error and you lose your ranked points.I incredibly recommend the game if they correct the bugs. But if they don't you'll just get mad with it.			"

												The game is unstable. I have never seen anything like it. Every time I load it it keeps crashing and the screen keeps going on and off. I originally tried starting this game with my 7 years old Windows 7 OS PC, but it couldn't handle it. So I thought with my new PC I'd have no problem because it's high spec; Windows 8.1 64 bit OS, Intel I7 4930K 3.4Ghz Hex Core, GTX 980, 32GBs of 2133Mhz RAM and 2TBs SSHD.SURPRISE! I doesn't work on my high spec PC either!!! This game was legendary back in the day and I think SkyBox Labs should stand ashamed of themselves as they did such a poor job of remastering and turning this game HD. If I can't play it, I can't rate it and recommend it to ANYONE. Nice Job SkyBox Labs! You ruined a legendary game!			"

												Malista!I got this game on disc over ten years ago. I got the Titans expansion as a gift a year or two afterwards, when I had fourteen teeth removed in a single operation. This is the game I played when I was stuck at home in pain all day, so forgive me if this review -is- a little biased.Even though I don't play it as much anymore, the campaigns are always a blast. I can't speak to multiplayer, however - I was never really good at that stuff anyway. The steam multiplayer community isn't *too* active, but it isn't too dead either. If I recall correctly there's actually still a pretty active Voobly community for the game.The achievements for this game are a little grindy to say the least. Having to play 1,000 online games got a little boring after a while, and it seems as if the hidden achievement for Alpaca Hour is almost impossible to get legitimately nowadays as the developers haven't switched on the toggle for it in over a year. I ended up just setting my clock back to get it.Overall... a timeless classic! For me it's well worth the price, but since most people aren't as attached to this game as I am, I'd recommend waiting for a sale before you pick this game up, which happens quite often to my knowledge.Any last quips? I wish they'd bring back the old theme music!			"

												Age of Mythology was one of the few gems that dominated my childhood, I have many fond memories of throwing hours of my life into the hundreds of amazing maps that players designed shortly after release including The Settlers and Cat and Mouse. Despite being quite pricey for an old game I think it's worth every penny for one of the gems of the RTS genre.The Extended Edition comes with some fantastic upgrades including full Steam Support and upgrades to the interface and textures of the game. I've been waiting a long time for this and I'm so happy this masterpiece is on Steam now.Pros+ Improved textures & Interface.+ Solid mod support+ Steamworks integrationCons- Suffers from the same network and desync problems that the original did.Verdict 9/10			"

												WITH THE NEW UPDATE (Chinese Patch) ABSOLUTLY NO! With the new patch for this 10+Years old game you can't play any real random Mission. So from start on, i  love this game. But with this new patch including the chinese Patch, you will get in you're game (if you don't own the DLC): -SPAM about the DLC (""get the dlc etc."")- you will have automatically, in your loved classics, the extra not clickable gods- ALL RANDOM missions are not working. (!!!)So well you pay much of money for an old game and you won't be able to play the random missions, because you will automatically get the new Gods (which you don't have installed, as long as you don't buy the DLC). Now of course you don't have the DLC installed but you get randomly always (?!) the new god. And Because you don't own the DLC you have 3 options after 3 seconds of gameplay: - BUY DLC- Quit the mission- Quit the game. yep. That is it. That's how you destroy and old game. Don't buy until fixed or a ""how to remove chinese patch"" is availible. Good Job Devoloper/EDIT: And by the way, the DLC is even at steam with ""mixed"" 52% reviews at the moment. At a Price of 10€.			"

												Broken game, runs worse than the non-steam version; the MMR system is completely broken and people just desyncs right before they lose so you wont get any rating. The graphics are the same as the classic game, except they often glitch out. The units pathfinding is unbelievably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they will often get stuck in normally uncrossable terrain. There are very few servers and most of them are running mods, so, very often, the only way to have a standard game is by using the matchmaking system, which will put you against anyone it finds (yes, anyone, be him 100 mmr points ahead or below you).Shortly, this game is definitely not worth its full price, as its litterally worse than the standard AoM: The Titans on every point of view. Then, of course, the campaign is awesome and you can still play with friends or enjoy mods, but to do that you can as well just get the standard AoM from a retail vendor for a lot less money.			"

												I've always loved this game.When I found out it was on steam I knew that I was going to to get it immediatly.I heavily recommend for anyone who enjoys RTS game or the AOE franchise to play this game.However be wary that this game has many faults, the multiplayer is regarded by many to be the worst that steam has to offer, and has many, many bugs and glitches.If you already own a physical copy that still works or use Windows 10 it's not worth the large cost to upgrade.The graphical enhacement and ""Extended features"" are not anything to write home about, the graphics are formidable but are still lacking in comparrison to other games out on the steam store, the workshop intergration is a nice addition for those (Including me) who could not download mods off of the internet.This game is still amazing, and the story is amazing, the linking of all of these mythological characters was executed very well.Story: 8/10, I love it's creativity but it does rely heavily on clichés and plot holes.Gameplay: 7/10, Plays like all RTS with little veriation other than myth units and heroes.Online: 4/10, Terrible multiplayer, with the little veriety AOM had to begin with, mixed with the laggy and sometimes unplayable multiplayer it gets worse.Graphics: 6/10, Amazing compared to the original version however as I said before, they are not the best.Overall score: 7/10, Great game but bad multiplayer that damages the steam intergration.If you enjoy RTS. this game is a must have.

												When I saw the AoM:Extended Edition, it seemed like the perfect solution. We've played the game for years, but three CD's later, it was time to get another one. And I was tired of buying plastic media to play a game I paid for.Steam's digital download seemed perfect. And then we actually tried playing the game.Ensemble Studios should be (and probably is) ashamed to be associated with tis product. The refresh rate is pretty near 5 frames per second, despite my machine running brand new high-detail 3D games at 60 fps. The multiplayer data connection is so slow it's unplayable.This was a complete and utter waste of money. Can't un-recommend this game enough. Just don't buy it. "

												As you can see I've quite a bit of playtime on this game so clearly I do enjoy playing it. However the review system on steam is ""Do you recommend this game?"" And there I say no. But do I recommend it to previous Age Of Mythology and Titans expansion players? Yes.This game is great fun especially if you play a lot of scenario maps, classics like escape are always good fun or tower defence. I barely ever play the base game my self I always play user generated game modes and while they are VERY good they are subject to the same bugs and crashes and flaws as the rest of the game. The desync bug seems very rare now for several months I havent had it but maybe thats just my luck. That said random crash to desktops can happen upon starting a match online. Some people report issues with running the game, even when they have a good hardware setup. It has been fine for me. I actually play in 1440p maxed capping my self at 60fps it seems to never drop without good reason.Most of the time I play without these crashes but when it does happen it is extremely frustrating as you can wait some times half an hour to fill a lobby with people. (online is not dead but its a small and close community.)So the run down is fans of the original, especially scenario players, will be happy with being able to play all of the new scenarios which are being developed by the same people who did all those years ago on AOM Heaven.Fans who played the original and mostly played supremacy and the occasional scenario like world map are still catered for but will not see much difference apart from the new OP chinese gods (they are the new atlantis). Though desyncs dont really happen now you may still get random crashes on launching a match.Those who never played before well it's a good rts even its base game supremacy mode which im still just as bad at is pretty fun and there are a lot of new players who play supremacy so you wont be alone. But you learn how buggy the game can be. Not so much in gameplay but stability. You may be better off with the original game using some third party software for online. Though if you do that the people you will play are going to be experienced players.Either way I think if you're going to buy this wait until there is a sale. It drops all the time during every major sale to quite a low price. And during those times instead of seeing 20-50 people in the general lobby during peak times you will see over 100 because of all the noobs. So its a good time to start and will save you some money.Don't buy this at full price.			"

												After the update that came before the new dlc a number of game breaking bugs were introduced that have not been fixed.   The worse part is that I have not even bought the dlc and rather then have a more stable experinence (since the dlc had even more bugs) my experience is actually worse because the game was updated to look for the dlc even if you don't have it.  Making it so that I can't select random for any options when playing against the computer since it crashes after searching for and selecteing dlc that I never purchased. The update was also designed so that all of the starting menus remind you that you don't have the dlc by showing gray boxes everywhere.  Which in my option just adds salt to the wound since it keeps reminding me of the reason my game is broken while saying give me money.			"

												Love Age of Mythology. Hate extended edition and Tale of the Dragon. No one wanted this game to work more than me. There is a long list of complaints I have, some that others may disagree with. But what I think we can all find inexcusable is how broken the multiplayer is. Horrible lag, games will just crash out to menu or drop without apparent reason, etc. etc. And I know it’s not an issue with other player ping or something to that effect because you don't have the same problem playing Vanilla or Titans. I stuck around for a while hoping they would fix it. They haven't, and I don't imagine they will. If you love this game, get the original version and play on Game Ranger. You'll have a better gameplay experience and a larger community to play with (unless all your only really into is single player, in which case there is no reason to buy this anyway).Oh, and I almost forgot, new maps are literally unfinished! They have maps say it has certain features in the map menu, but the map just doesn’t have the feature at all. And when you look it up online, they just didn't to put it in OR even bother take out the text promising the feature!

The optimization is horrible, the online services are unplayable, and the new ""HD"" looks worse than the original game that came out in 2003.

												An HD remake of the original game, the spiritual sequel to Age of empires that's more about skirmishes between heroes and monsters than it is about setpiece armies and ancient kingdoms. The game takes large departures from the Empire serie,s but stays familiar enough to be recognizeable to an outsider. The game is fantastic, and although the mythos is bigger, the scale is a bit smaller: Military units always take multiple population, restricting your army size.Nothing here will win you over if you disliked the game already, but if you were a fan then, you'll be a fan now. That said: Thirty dollars is pretty steep. I would wait for a sale.			"

I'd say now that I haven't encountered the save problem or any FPS drops, this is the game I remember playing as a youngin and loving, and it's still super fun yet I also still think it could use MORE upgrades both visually and added material, because it's pretty much the same base Mythology game (plus titan exp pack or w/e) with added steam fun stuff (badges, multiplayer). So if you loved this game/love RTS games, get this, but if you're on the fence about it wait for a sale, because you won't find 30 bucks worth imo. :D Again if you'd like to see more, visit www.BalsacandJenniferLawrencePlaySteam.com and check out our WORLD EXCLUSIVE XXX Video Premiere ""Zeus ♥♥♥♥s Athena in the♥♥♥♥♥while Hephaestus is at work"") *NSFW*I give this functioning Age of Mythology game a 4out of 5Original Post:As of right now don't buy this game. Have only been able to successfully save once. Just played through an entire skirmish and at the end it didnt give me the victory and crashed when trying to save. Buggy POS. Dissapointed. I don't know what ""Extended Features"" means because I don't really notice a whole lot extra, and was expecting a higher visual upgrade tbh. AoE2 HD worked right out of the gate (except multiplayer which I hear in AoM is even worse) and this has been nothing but trouble, which sucks since I was really looking forward to this. Hopefully they patch this in the next week or so, otherwise this could be 24bucks (30 for new buyers) down the hole. I tip my fedora to the devs for cashing in, but smh if these problems aren't fixed. Of course there are people who have had no trouble with the game (curse them) but unfortunately many bugs plague it atm. I love the idea of remaking these classic games, but a little overhaul to some textures and steam trading cards doesn't justify 30 bucks. Leaving it at ""recommended"" in case they do make it fun.Verdict: Not even Zeus having unprotected hardcore sex with Athena in 1080p could make me feel like this was a solid purchase. (as of right now) I give this game a 2 out of 5.**#BalsacSessler. Did you like my review?

												This game just went downhill after the release of the dlc as it constantly lagged. Those who didn't have it couldn't play as it was an automatic win for those with it once a certain troop comes into play after which i requested a refund for the dlc. You're unable to fully enjoy the game as they force you to have that dlc and even then it's been horrible. Hardly any players on anymore! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.			"

												I would love to recommend this game since I have loved it for many years. Unfortunately, the developers decided to make some DLC that makes the game unplayable unless you buy it. I instantly crash whenever I try to choose the Random Map option at the main menu. This game is not playable without the DLC(which I'm told is very sub-par and basically just re-uses old resources) which is $10(a complete rip off). I do not recommend this game while it is in this broken state. They said they released a hotfix, but that did not fix anything.			"

												Great game that is let down by its optimization and lack of modern day standards. Locked 100% GPU usage (even in the menu?!) on a 970 in a game that looks 10 years old...really? The multiplayer experience is horrific too, lags and disconnects that require you to restart your game almost every match. UI is the same as the 2002 version and there is no steam integration, there is just soooo much to complain about, such a loss of opportunity to revive such a great game. I feel sorry for the people that find £30 games expensive, I would be really angry if I needed that money after buying this game. New troops and gods are cool though, pretty much the only positives.			"

I do not see an option to avoid what I don't have either. As a matter of fact, it shouldn't try to load what I don't have. This reeks of a poorly implemented marketing tactic. I refuse to buy this expansion just to play the game I love, bought 3 times already and have played for YEARS just fine.Outraged.Fix this and I shall ammend my review accordingly.Thank you.			"

												If you're wanting to play LAN games, don't buy this version, get the original from somewhere else. This version is very buggy for LAN games, and has terrible, terrible lag, random desyncs (player drops), and is very buggy when trying to save the game and resume at a later time. You'll not get to finish 1/3 of the games you start due to these bugs. We also encountered game corruption, where multiple players will experience severe graphics glitches making the game unplayable. Saving & resuming did not resolve this, it kept spreading & getting worse. The original game (and titans expansion) was rock solid, so if you can get your hands on that instead of this game, you will avoid much disappointment and headaches.I got it during the summer sale so it's worth the money I paid, and still a good game, but that is in spite of the horrible problems they've added to it with this ""Extended"" edition. Oh, and they've paywalled the ""giant"" sized maps, so you'll have to get the dragon DLC to play that map size.			"

												Ok so I love this game and have played it for along time with my wife. A new DLC jus dropped(I didn't buy it) 3 days ago and without the DLC i got a random map featuring one of the chinease(DLC civilization) as an enemy, the game started up a bug report came up saying I needed the DLC for the chinease units and closed the match. I'm livid that 14 some years after the games released a shotty azz DLC is launched which has mixed reviews which I would've bought save for those reviews and then find the DLC breaks EVERY SINGLE PERSONS GAME who doesn't even purchase it.First fix my game I only ever play random matches so u completely broke my game, second fix your DLC so it aint buggy and ppl don't hate it, third put DLC on sale so I'll buy it. Then I'll change my review.			"

												As a long time Age of Mythology die hard, it begs the question just what is an ""Extended Edition""? Age of Empires II was just known as being ""HD"" so what does it mean here? Honestly, very very little, for some nothing at all even. But does that stop it from being worth it at all? Asking this old fan, I'd like to think so... depending.Pros:+ Classic gameplay intact+ Readily includes The Titans expansion and Golden Gift extra+ New visual updates work+ Steam workshop+ Online interface and scenario sharing simple+ Developers keen to update+ New Tale of the Dragon expansion coming over a decade later+ Prostagma!Cons:- Multiplayer servers regularly don't display properlly- Online lag, sometimes difficult to know who has the connection issue- Visual updates minor at best- Nothing has really been ""extended"", Age of Empires II HD had a better, more reflective title...- ...and as a result the full price tag is too highSummery:This new version is at the end of the day is still classic Age of Mythology and has aged very well gameplay wise (despite some obvious old graphical quirks) in a landscape where real-time base building strategy is not as prevelant as it once was. Being on Steam and the perks that it brings with it (intergrated online community, workshop, future updates) with all the content is the easiest way to play today. However, even after a some time, the multiplayer issues are still noticable, in fact for some it may even be a deal breaker. Speaking of which, despite my overall praise, the game is not updated all that much making the 20+ price tag for most regions outright steep so even if like me you are a long time fan, a sale being your best option. Thankfully that does come regularly. Overall the package is worth a buy for the right lower price by your own standard and the developers do have plans to update the game beyond simply another expansion (visuals, balance, servers), I myself will update this review a period following the release of the expansion as some of these issue are very important and should have been ironed out sonner, in the case of online. Still, in the meantime what we've got at the end of the day is classic Age of Mythology.			"

												A great game that is still fun to play that I've spent many days playing back when it first came out.This port, however, is terriable. Tons of graphical bugs, some audio problems here and there, and the Multiplayer has terriable connection issues which has yet to be fixed. It's like they didn't give a damn with ""upgrading"" this reboot and just made it half♥♥♥♥♥run on new systems. (They have put more work into Age of Empires II HD than this)There really isn't much added into this game. It only includes the main game, the Titans expansion, and a few other little things that is not with the $30 that it's asking. When it hit's -50% or more, then grab it up!Till they fix the MP to work better, which was the main reason why I bought this game to play with my best friend, it's only really a single player game at the moment, but still fun if you love Age of Mythology or RTS games. Get it on sale and not full price.			"

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is an RTS that has in my opinion stood the test of time.  First and foremost this game is related almost directly to the Age of Empires collection. The big difference is the injection of Mythology and Gods instead of historical civilizations like in Age of Empires. A few different things have been changed but you will see about the same formulas being practiced.When I first started playing this game it was almost ten years ago. I had very slow internet but thankfully found this solid game on disk. I was amazed with the quality and the single player replayability. One of my favorite things is the simple and fun editor where you can make your own maps or your own challenges. I would mostly roleplay in which I would make up different battles and very own campaign. It was very satisfying when I could put time into my own ideas.I have always liked the resource race in this game as well where you start by hunting then move up to farming or knowing when to get that next woodcutting or mining upgrade. Managing your economy with your military plays a very large part too. There are many small things in this game that make it feel very well done, as an example when your units are upgraded it updates the armor and weapon textures. Little things like that have always appealed to me while playing because it makes me feel like the developers really cared about this game. I read about how the developers argued for days over the god powers to make sure they were balanced. I believe that's called making a good game to were you care so much about the fairness you push yourself and others that hard.Skybox is another story. I enjoy the fact steamworks is now into the game and instant modifications can be applied that enhance the way I play the game but they have done an ""ok"" job. The price is a little to much for a game that is this old. Right now is a sale for around $7 and I would recommend you buy it at a time like this but $30 on the other hand is just too much when the disk has been in the bargin bin for half a decade. I could go on about the desync issues but in the end I will recommend this game in its current state.Honestly I am just really happy this is on Steam. I have met so many of die hard fans that I would have never met playing offline so very long ago. It really makes me glad that the community still cares and likes to have a good time with this awesome relic.Thanks for reading.			"

												This isn't quite as good as the original because the multiplayer is essentially broken. However, the singleplayer gameplay is just as good as the original version and the graphics updates and steamworks support are nice additions. While I do reccomend this game, I would wait until it goes on sale (usually at every major Steam sale) and purchase it then, as I don't think it is worth the $30. It is still a blast to play and the gameplay hasn't aged a bit.			"

												I liken these recent updated Ensemble/Microsoft classics to buying a Ferrari full of puppies and pizza, they're that much fun. Take some of the best games from our gaming history, update them to work well on modern machines including the multiplayer components, then blow them out with a giant list of modern features like cloud save, achievements, trading cards, workshop, stats and on and on, sell them for a reasonable price and here we are, with a game that I will play until the end of my days.You don't get nearly as many wide-eyed blissful moments with gaming or with most other things in your adult years compared to your childhood, but that's exactly how I felt 30 minutes into playing this updated version, like a kid on Christmas morning. While I may seem a little over the top in my effusive praise, look here; Ensemble is my favorite developer of all time, Age of Empires II and Age of Mythology are among my favorite games of all time, and these updated versions of those games tick every box I need them to tick and then some. This is pure gaming perfection as far as I'm concerned.			"

												I think the devs made a mistake in emphasizing the shiny new graphics and features, because yes, they look stunning compared to the older version, but unfortunately I believe many people have gotten the impression that that's the only thing they're getting for their thirty bucks.I would honestly buy this game on steam without any additions for the same price. The better graphics can disappear for all I care, because what this re-release truly means is the return of multiplayer, a bigger, more active community, and devs that actually listen and actively improve the game. In my opinion, that is what I am buying, and I am not disappointed with the results. I would definitely recommend this to anyone whether old or new, to relive the experience or see it for the first time. :)			"

												Love this game, I worship it. Spent countless hours creating maps in editor and making unstoppable armies of Gastraphetes(100% balanced ofc). What I do not love, is this festering, stinking heap of a cash grab.All they had to do was fix multiplayer. Bring people back.Instead they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimized shader system that makes it unplayable on any computer the game used to play well on. It lags and overheats my GTX 760.(It shouldn't even get past 30 degrees! wtf?) You need mods to get rid of their bugs(which were never there in the original version), their multiplayer is even more broken(game versions not matching...). ♥♥♥♥♥♥ achievements with portraits from units ingame. They ♥♥♥♥ed up God Portrait resolution on one picture. HOW? They ♥♥♥♥ed up the manticores wings. HOW? They added nothing(except the water, dassit), and ♥♥♥♥ed up things that worked. All the UI improvements and texture improvements were already on the net.♥♥♥♥ you, Skybox. Go to hell. You only had to fix the multiplayer, and I would have gladly paid the full price. Stay away people, get the original version somewhere. They ballsed it up here.			"

												Been playing the original constantly for the past 10 years but this ""HD"" remake is terrible. Apart from the fatal crashes half way through single-player random maps where the game just restarts for no reason, the graphics additions actually make things worse. With the new water, you can barely see fish through it, or units hiding in the water on the shore, the bloom is bad quality (even if you have a GTX Titan), the models (which haven't been HD'd) just don't suit the new lighting, they look all bubbly/oversmoothed and horrible, and the dynamic shadows look bad. I'm usually a graphics nut but I had to turn it all off and it's still ugly / hard to read. It's like some guy had this great water shader and was like ""hey we could stick it in AoM and call it HD, and we'd better shoehorn in some other crap to make it seem worth it"". Going back to the original version.			"

Here is my lists of what i like and what i dont. you guys read and see. and compare for yourselfs. also i am gonna recommend some mods that to me must have! in order to make the game feel like they should have made it in the firts place.The Good1-Very well done(and long) campaing (thanks, originals Devs.)2-Addictive gameplay sometimes have more fun that AOE 3.(thanks,original Devs)3- The water is very pretty they really to me mad ea greta job on it, if only they made the terrain as equal.4-Like the shadows they added and the day and night cycle.( thank,skybox)5- love the choice of gods and the power and myth units they provide.sometimes i dont even get why this game hasnt made a sequel.(thanks original team)6-I heard multiplayer is good.7-Steam workshop.The Bad1-Better AI, and being able to choose dificulty individually.Able to tell your AI what to do Attack, defense, economic etc etc.2-Game UI is very limited,cant even see how many villager one has and who is picking what resource.(MUST HAD!!!!!!! very important!!!)3-Cant choose colors for your race,they could have made the graphics a bit better especially the units. 4-Myth Units upgrades dont show diference when upgraded.(must add)5-No advanced Advanced tooltips.(must had!)6-Bland terrain textures.( your water effect were very good, could have done the same to the terrain)7-Steam workshop(cant acess your MODS if you play offline, to me i cant play whit put the mods)8-Serius lag and frezees on campaign cutscenes i dont know in multiplayer.9-At firts lots of bugs they have improve somewhat.10-Colors look bland. specially team colors11-I dont get diplomacy mode and how it works.( mi opinion, if somebody know feel free to tell me)12-lag and freeze when scrolling on the map.13-when unit die they look like a foto on the ground they could have made tiny 3d models as the body decays.(this is not necesary but it would sure look cool)What I hope from skybox1- Make all the error gone.2- Add a new race in the future(highlty unlikely but still hope so)3- Drop down the price.20$ whit out the many bugs if like it is now sell it at 15$.4- Add the basic stuff so at least we dont have to connect online to get the mods.(new terrain textures, unit upgrades, better UI, advanced tooltips).Mods that improve the quality of the game. i cant play whitout them.1-Better game UI.2-Advanced tooltips.3-upgrades Mod pack.4-Epic textures.5-Player colour mod( this just make your team color look more deep in color) If Any in Skybox labs sees this i personaly have some words of advice, for you as a costumer. your saving grace in this game was that you ""remade"" a clasic you guys sold more for nostalgia than anything else.if you keep making flops like this people WILL wont want to buy from you guys anymore. personally for your next title i would think of buying it if it came form you guys. this game feels unfished i think you had more ideas but dint come to fruitition and were rushed into making it. please update the crap out of this game. you WILL lose custumers if you dont and lose yours jobs in the process. If your remade Rise of Nations(i think that what you guys are doing or had plans for) try to learn from your mistakes and make the game look pretty and feel more like today RTS games UI and tooltips are very important also the terrain.(except water i personally love the water effects) and also add the great stuff you guys added. also expand on the game like add 2 or 4 races more. people eat that up. i personally will and pay for it, as long as it a fair price.

												EXACTLY the same as the original mythology with extremely, extremely minor detail differences that aren't noticable whatsoever. The graphics are still as bad as they used to be, the glitches haven't been fixed or even touched on, the AI hasn't been improved (so you still have the issue of 50% of your ally's/enemies freezing and doing nothing all match) and it genuinely is NOT extended by any definition. The story is the same, the gameplay is the same, the night/day cycle DOESN'T WORK and despite the massive nolstagic trip out it still has nothing good going for it. I'd consider this a waste of money. There are other games that are much better and there are other developers who don't mislead you who also do genuinely good work, save your money for yourself or for people who deserve it.			"

												Having grown up with this game (and lost my original CD) it was absolutely fantastic to see it available on Steam. However I was quite baffled when I saw the game's price tag; to demand 27,99€ for a game that is more than a decade old is absurd, saying it is a HD remake does not even justify the price - graphics are the same as it was back in 2002, but with dynamic shadows and a day/night cycle.If you didn't play Age of Mythology back when it was released I wholeheartedly recommend it as the game features: Great campaign storyline.  Well made characters. Decent balanced factions.  An interesting history menu where you can read about the lore of individual units. Beautiful background music.To this day, I still consider Age of Mythology to be one of the most successful RTS games ever made and to play it again after 12 years really gives me a sense of nostalgia, but if want to buy it I would suggest looking elsewhere as a HD remake does not justify a 27,99€ price tag.

												The original, being a game i've played since I was only 4, has been, and always will be, my favorite game. That being said, this version (Age of Mythology: Extended Edition) has become a close second. The flow of the game feels the same as it did over a decade ago with a few minor touch-ups and improvements. I'll admit it, the graphical overhaul wasn't as ""stunning"" as i'd hoped it would have been, but, it leaves you with the nostalgic feeling of playing a childhood game once again. I've put thousands of hours into the original version, hundreds into the titans expansion, now, it's time to do the same on the extended! If you're new to Age of Mythology, or god-type games in general, but you really like strategy games, dive into this RTS and sink your teeth in. I guarentee you'll get a mouthfull!			"

												Fun classic, great concepts, but this remake is suffering from alot of bugs and glitches, not as fun as the original until these are fixed, which might take a while. The game is 40% off currently, I guess that is as cheap as this game will get on Steam, so I suggest buying it now, and if you can stomach tons of bugs and glitches, play it now or wait until later. When those are fixed, this game will be godly.			"

												I rarely ever write  a review but this just made me write one :/First of all I seem to be one of those who don't experience any issues be it framedrop, crashing or other stuff.BUT what I read in the reviews and the forum, before it was deleted by the devs.... yes you heard right, is just awful!It seems like those ""developers"" just made a lazy half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥product  with little to no optimization. I read of crashes when launching the game since the DLC is out, Multiplayer is laggy since teh release of the base game, random desyncs in MP and the list goes on to save files beeing corrupted and crashes when starting a SP game. Also the AI seems to be even worse from what I've heard.If I haven't already played 5 hours I would get a refund just so the devs didn't get my money (even though the game is working fine for me)Now to the fun thing. They recently deleted the Steam Forum. But after the ♥♥♥♥♥torm they got and about 90% of the threads are about crashing we have to assume that those amateurs can't even take responsibility for their product they just threw out despite it beeing very buggy. The Dev's are the worst. I like the idea of remaking an RTS classic in an age where this genre seems to die out or at least lose a lot of popularity, but if they can't even make it work and even make it worse with the new DLC they shouldn't have done it from the beginning. That beeing said. Don't buy it. You have no reason to do so. If you actually like the devs screw you, they are just as lazy as early acess devs which just quit their game.If you actually read all this, I hope I could help you. Just buy the original game and not the Extended edition, it runs better has no bugs.EDIT: The Forum wasn't deleted sorry for writing that it was only out of business for some timeEDIT EDIT: The game stopped working for me. Can't start it. I tried every ""solution"" and nothing works. I don't know what changed but I would suggest to not turn off your computer or update any program if you get this game to work. Turning off my PC broke it for me.♥♥♥♥♥these devs. I am out.			"

												This is a great game. I've spent hours playing it and have enjoyed it for years. But, this Extended Edition is a piece of garbage. The game is completely glitched. One of the more innocuous glithces occurs when you click on, say a tree, and drag toward a unit the game will think you clicked on and are commanding the tree; thankfully though the commands will be of the unit, not of the tree. Then, there are the abominable graphical glitches which can, at times, make the game unplayable necessitating a reset. At times the map won't load. These glitches first showed up months ago, it seems the Microsoft Studios are trying their best to make their intent of milking the Age of Mythology till it's lying motionless sprawled across dead grass as obvious as they possibly could. The most apt description of this version is schizophrenic. It will reset in the middle of a game, the entire game will close, the graphics will disintigrate, and all other assortments of frustrations. If anyone is curious my computer can handle games with superior graphics with no issue, the problem is rooted in the version of this game itself.If you want to play this game then buy an old version of it on CD. This version isn't even worth the $4.99 that it'll occasionally be sold for let alone the regular 29.99; it leads to too many irritations. After all, the ""improved graphics"" are meaningless when the entire Christ forsaken game can't handle them to the point where it glitches to Hell!			"

												Summary - The Chinese expansion is rushed, copy-pasted from existing things, and glitchy. The people who profit from this are not the ones who made the original Age of Mythology.Icons for Chinese buildings are re-used existing ones.Chinese god powers and soldiers are like copies of existing ones, just changed a little bit. For example, the chinese monk is the egyptian priest with a different model, texture, icon and description, and instead of converting animals he converts enemies. He waves his arms and makes the exact same chant, and the cursor turns into an Egyprian Ankh when you mouse-over enemies.Incorrect descriptions - The two Chinese heroes we start with are given Arkantos's description of special powers.Poor story-telling - Unlike the original campaign, the beginning of the Chinese campaign has very little story-telling. You are not introduced to the gods, and you just start already in the second age. We only have a brief introduction to the heroes.At the beginning of the campaign.../(SPOILER)\The heroes have to travel across China because when they realise there's evil afoot, a random peasant tells them to cross china, and so they do with no questions asked.\(SPOILER)/Graphic glitches on my new-ish computer - You can see flames if the ground is behind them, but not if the sky if behind them. When placing walls. the wall segment that is behind another is drawn in front of what is actually in front of it.Glitched first scenario in the Chinese campaign - You start in the Second age, but if you restart you are in the first age.It runs slowly.You can drag a box to select four soldiers and it will tell you you've selected only two, or the ""bamboo tree"" nearby.My fortified wall upgraded to an earthen wall.I got a steam card of Thor with a really bad picture on it, with the description ""The Norse god of lightning"". Thor is the god of thunder.This is my review after only getting to the second scenario in the Chinese campaign, because waiting to finish it to write the review would make it too late for the review to be helpful, because it's only just been released. Perhaps it's not their fault that the Chinese are so similar to the other ones, because there are only so many possibilities, and the three original races have already taken a share of the possibilities, but the lacking story-telling and the obviously reused artwork and code make it seem like the people who made it rushed it, or did not enjoy maknig it, or something like that. If it was released as a free mod then it would probably be well recieved, but it's been named an official expansion.			"

												A good classic RTS game with nice thematics, story, gameplay. Comes with the Titans expansion, which adds up to the game. Also has some improved details in the graphics, compared to the original version.Has a great atmosphere, varied and balanced factions, lots of different units, and a great, massive campaign. There's a friends-only and a global ranked system for multiplayer mode (btw filter by ping before picking your games, since it's an international level).Had several bugs since it came out and some laggy features, but it's noticeable that the support team is working on it, many were fixed.

												OBS: Somente sobre a nova expansão, o jogo original é incrível e não tem contras...o original de 2002 eu recomendo, vou falar sobre...Age of Mythology: Tales of the Dragon--> Prós: (5%) - Iniciativa e pequeníssimo esforço de trazer o jogo de volta a ativa depois de uma década e pouco, colocando mais unidades e deuses da mitologia chinesa.--> Contras: (95%) - Tudo, fizeram essa expansão depois de uma noite de bebedeira em Las Vegas, de ressaca. - História da campanha foi horrível, vergonhosa...uma cópia mal feita com a base da engine do jogo original. - Jogabilidade fraquíssima com DEZENAS de erros de programação, bugs e falhas por todos os lados. - Extremamente comercial e superficial, uma vergonha para os fãs. - Nova trilha sonora dos chineses ridícula, pegaram um ""Background Music"" de meditação chinesa do youtube e simplesmente atiraram ali no jogo...já a trilha sonora original continua fantástica, mas não vem ao caso. - Decepcionante, pela expectativa que foi gerada em cima da nova expansão. - Nem sei porque fizeram uma porcaria dessas, cagou tudo...se vai acrescentar algo novo para um jogo que marcou na história dos games, pelo menos faz algo descente, sem falhas, algo autêntico, dinâmico e surpreendente onde passaria as expectativas de todos os jogadores do game original.

As far as the game itself is concerned, it's simply an amazing and beloved classic.However, most people would want to purchase it when it's on sale, due to the fact that it's quite overpriced.All in all, I am inclined to believe that Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a very enjoyable game and may offer endless hours of entertainment to both longtime RTS fans and newcomers to the genre and/or franchise.Notable features and additions to the old game, for those who are interested in further info:Updated graphics and textures! Now suitable for higher (e.g. HD) resolutions!Long awaited bugfixes and balance changes!Trading cards!Achievements!Steam Workshop for all kinds of mods (easy to install and upload mods)! "

												DLC for a game should be something extra, and those who don't have it should still be able to play the standard game.Not in this case though. Since the Far Eastern Mythology DLC came out the game no longer works for me. The first time I started a game the AI consisted of civs all belonging to the new DLC, yet I didn't own it. Then the game realises that and crashes. And now I can't even run it unless I 'update' it, as in 'unless you have all DLC you won't get anything'......And that was months ago, and I'm still waiting for this to get fixed...And untill the moment it has been fixed, I'm convinced the devs are either trying to scam you or they don't give a flying damn thing about this game anymore. And that is a real shame, because this was, and still is, a great chapter in the Age games line, and it hurts to see it in this state right now.			"

												Great game, but this extended edition performs badly; it's not well optimized. Could run all of the other AoE, as well as the original AoM, just fine but this one takes a dip in framerates just by scrolling through the map.If you experience slowness/reduced framerates, you can try some of the methods mentioned by others (ensure you're not running in integrated graphics if you have a dedicated card, run in the lowest resolution, turn off water refraction and shadows). This kind-of helped, slightly, but the game's frequent frame-drop just makes it unplayable.			"

												Compelling storyline, diversity in player races/classes, and well thought-out map/level design makes this game the best in the franchise. I just finished playing all three, and I can't get over how they overlooked the idea of having 3 distinct player races have separate strengths and weaknesses that accomodate most playstyles to an RTS. Of course, its ""easy"" campaign option makes the campaign a rewarding experience as you play through all three classes in 48 scenarios. I haven't really dug into the multiplayer yet, but if I did I would feel more than prepared after such an engaging campaign. If you were thinking about getting into franchises or RTS in general, this is the one in the series to get. AoE 2 is much too difficult for me to recommend right away, and the story in the third is far too bland and uninteresting. If you're struggling or you find it boring, play it on Twitch. If you're lucky, you'll have nice viewers help you through it - it definitely made it more interesting for me to play.			"

BUT there are a lot of problems with this version of the game including:- The new DLC makes it incredibly frustrating to play, as vanilla users will be constantly dc'ing when using certain abilities on DLC units. - The multiplayer is pretty garbage, takes forever to find a game and when you do it's either extremely lag-ridden or crashes.They should have left the DLC out and done a better job with multiplayer, then it would be 10/10 "

												The game has always been full of bugs, but now they've taken it to a new level!The latest release can't hold an online game reliably.  I'm seeing 80%+ of my games end with a sync error now!  It just quits and its tough luck.  That on its own is enough to make this game pointless.This is on top of all the other bugs that already existed within the game (too many to mention).They also have blocked off parts of the game previously accessible, like the nomad map now requires you buy the expansion.  Not only that but the name gods are rather unbalanced, meaning the only way to win is to buy the expansion to get the more powerful gods.Totally awful poorly tested product.  Do not buy this game they're a rip off. "

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a fun RTS game that allows you to play as different ancient gods and use their different abilities to wipe out your enemies. If you're a super competitive gamer and love trying a bunch of various strategies I would totally recommend this game, this is for you. I haven't played the other Age of Mythology games, so I can't say how accurate this one is, however this was recommended to me by a friend who says it's very accurate. Take that as a third party source, though.This is by no means a bad game, and it excels in what it does. It provides a challenging RTS experience that you can enjoy with friends or on your own. The problem for me comes from the game being a tad too competitive. This might not be a problem for you, and it might actually be a good thing. If that's the case you should get this game, probably when it's on sale. If you share the same opinion as me in this area in that you would rather spend your time goofing off than strategising and micromanaging resources, I would say no, you'd be better off spending your money on something else. That's just me, and I understand a lot of people feel otherwise, but for people like me I have to say no, I don't recommend it.			"

												Age Of Mythology is one of the best Real Time Strategy games ever made. It is unrivaled in depth and imagination. The playability of the game is endless. The campaign in Single Player may seem short for some people who like single player mode, but awaiting you and everyone is a massive base of user created scenarios and creations. In multiplayer this games is at it's best when it works. The new P2P style lobby system seems a little more unstable that the ESO system used previously. This game is a keeper, everyone who has it loves it.			"

												Just as good as I remember.Age of Mythology kept me busy for many hours when it first released in 2002 and it seems like it will do so now as well.If there's anything wrong with this game the only thing I can mention is how Vsync doesn't function in Multiplayer. There hasn't been any other technical trouble that I have ran into. Running this on my 7 year old rig just fine.So what is Age of Mythology?If you've ever played any of the Age of Empires games you'll know what you're getting into. Age of Mythology adds mythical creatures as units and adds (limited use) god powers from those gods who you choose to worship.			"

												Age of Mythology is one of my all-time favourite games and the only RTS I like. It's easy and intuitive to learn with an amazing soundtrack, varied gameplay and awesome campaign, context, story etc. The game design is flawless. I bought this just to re-experience the campaign. However, I did expect that, given it's ""Extended Edition"" to have updated graphics and some more features. The game does NOTHING!! I have no interest in the multiplayer but from what I hear it's broken - thus defeating the purpose of its revival. The only hope is improved graphics which it does NOT offer AT ALL. The screenshots are deeply misleading. If anything, the game is worse because of framerate drops and poor optimisation, non-functioning V-sync and other issues. If you haven't played Age of mythology, I strongly urge you to do so, but not at the extortionate price of this wannabe remake.			"

I played AoM until the servers went down in 2009-2010. So what do I think about the game now, 14 years later? Best game ever! Funny singleplayer but the best part is all innovative maps available online! It's a bit like Warcraft, but better looking and more fun to play. 10/10			"

												I used to love playing this game and as soon as i saw it was being redone through steam I pre-ordered it. I don't know why I bothered. The graphics improvements are not worth the money I paid for this. General animation of characters is extremely poor and juddery. Somehow it feels like they have made the game worse.  Would have been nice if they tweaked some of the gameplay features which now feel outdated like not having the option to auto-scout.If you already have the original version of the game like I do, I suggest installing and playing that rather than wasting your money.

												While for most re-releases, the publishers at least went through the trouble of giving the games a marginal graphical update, this is not the case for AoM. The Extended Edition looks 1-to-1 exactly the same as the original. Everything uses textures that look like we are still playing on 640x480 screens instead of 3840x2160. In fact, despite the 3D graphics of this game, the HD version of Age of Empires II looks vastly superior. This is shameless money grab with no work done whatsoever.			"

												As a kid I loved Age of Mythology and played hundreds of hours. Seeing this expansion has really been a knife in the back of the game I once loved so much.  The new content is lack luster the campaign is repetitive, poorly balanced and boring. And the new civ pretty much reuses previous models to create every new unit. But the worst part is the bugs. This game not only crashes itself but my entire computer multiple times aswell and aswell as messing up the new content they have also ruined the existing campaigns. Why can my walls cast earthquake??? Why do my units get stuck unmovably on cliff faces??? Why are upgrades moved to buildings that are not supposed to be able to research them??? Why are units able to be garisonned in buildings if the rally point is set to them??? The answer a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ effort from the game developers who not only managed to ruin the new content but also the existing game. . . Thanks!			"

												UPDATE: I saw people complaining about a terrible glitch with the Chinese factions of everything suddenly being destroyed when the scenario begins and losing immediately because of it. At first I didn't have that problem, I was even able to play a few levels of the Chinese storymode, NOW IT'S DOING IT FOR NOT JUST THE STORYMODE BUT NOW FOR EVERY FACTION AND EVERY RANDOM MAP I TRY TO PLAY!!! WTF!!Let me be clear that I love Age of Empires. It's the best real time strategy game of all time, but compared to earlier entries like Age of Empires 2, AoMythology feels like it's lacking. The growth and movements are a lot slower than I remember them to be, and despite the game being remastered with better graphics of the environment and buildings they are still really poor in terms of units (they're basically a few crude shapes with arms). the system of heroes and myth units put a difficult wrench into the mix of unit advantages, and it seems no matter how much you upgrade they die very quickly unless you have an overwhelming force. The buildings compared to AoE2 are also much weaker. Whereas in AoE2 castles and towers could protect you from all sorts of forces, the defenses in Age of Mythology are practically made of cardboard. It almost makes artillery pointless because so long as you're willing to lose a couple of cheap units you can stab whole fortresses to death in a matter of moments, something you and the enemy could rarely do in Age of Empires 2. There is one thing Age of Mythology has that is better than other titles and that's the learning element. It won't teach much history, but when you click on unit icons it opens up a short description of the unit's stories in mythology for myth units or if it's a human unit it will have a small explanation of that unit's weapons or place in ancient history. Even clicking on a wild animal will bring up it's scientific name and other facts about it. For learning purposes, this is the best part of the game. Something I loved about Mythology is that it had much better and much crazier cheatcodes. I'll never forget the glory that is WUV WOO and O CANADA which spawn a flying purple hippo and a superhero bear with the Canadaian flag on it's back. Yet for some reason, I can't get any of them to work anymore. That's reall disappointing for me because those cheats were amazing. All in all, I bought this game for the nostalgia and the new Chinese faction dlc, but feel it was not worth buying again. I much more recommend Age of Empires 2 because it is faster paced, more balanced, slightly cheaper, and has a lot more cultures to choose from.			"

When I was a kid I had this game for the ds, only difference was it was turn based and it didnt really ruin the game for me... but it made a whole new experience. HOWEVER when I came to this, it kinda ruined it I guess cause it was rts? (ikr? ) but also im sort of a casual player when it comes to ensembles aoe games and i like to face bots that prove a challenge but that I can still beat. In this game, when I play a skirmish, because of the rts and the god powers it makes it a lot harder to do things. The sad thing to me is that you can only use god powers one time in a game. I feel like some god powers should be a cool down thing such as the one lightning bolt , sure it may take like 1 min to cooldown and perhaps a certain amount of favor but maybe that would be a better system.the big pros (and not all of them probably):- Different cultures, they add a lot of diversity to the game.- Titans are awesome and badass, you're screwed though if one's heading towards your base.BIG CONS (and not all of them... maybe?)- Thank god I got this on sale, no way I would pay 30$ for this not even or aoe 1. (Which I think is the best out of them all personally.)- I like the settlements idea for ds wich was turn based but not a whole lot for an rts game however.- AGAIN with the house limit? come on I wanna make a huge sprawling city guys!- Just the way the game is, I dunno I cant get sucked in like aoe 3 or aoe 2 (check my hours guys i got a lot on those)- Now I feel like playing civ 5 (civ 5 is better then civ 6 don't get me started on that opinion) or the ds version instead of this game...unless i play this with a friend.- Finally, the price... really microsoft your going to put this price on this game?

In this game, when I play a skirmish, because of the rts and the god powers it makes it a lot harder to do things. The sad thing to me is that you can only use god powers one time in a game. I feel like some god powers should be a cool down thing such as the one lightning bolt , sure it may take like 1 min to cooldown and perhaps a certain amount of favor but maybe that would be a better system.the big pros (and not all of them probably):- Different cultures, they add a lot of diversity to the game.- Titans are awesome and badass, you're screwed though if one's heading towards your base.BIG CONS (and not all of them... maybe?)- Thank god I got this on sale, no way I would pay 30$ for this not even or aoe 1. (Which I think is the best out of them all personally.)- I like the settlements idea for ds wich was turn based but not a whole lot for an rts game however.- AGAIN with the house limit? come on I wanna make a huge sprawling city guys!- Just the way the game is, I dunno I cant get sucked in like aoe 3 or aoe 2 (check my hours guys i got a lot on those)- Now I feel like playing civ 5 (civ 5 is better then civ 6 don't get me started on that opinion) or the ds version instead of this game...unless i play this with a friend.- Finally, the price... really microsoft your going to put this price on this game? From something that probably ensemble studios made too.. who aren't around because of you...			"

												The first time I launched this game it actually worked fine. However, last night it came time to download an update to it... 6.0MB/6.0 ... DISK READ ERROR ... 121.0MB/121.0MB ... DISK READ ERROR ... An hour later the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing ... I defragmented my harddrive, cleaned my system with ccleaner and did an error check to my harddrive, and after a couple of more hours... NOPE! 0 bytes network usage, 0 bytes disk usage, 100 % completion of the update and... DISK READ ERROR!!! GRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!! What the ♥♥♥♥! I've never encountered anything like this before! Why doesn't it let me download an update to it? Why does my PC let me surf the net, chat and write this review even though the steam client doesn't let me complete the download of an important update! If you still consider buying this game after reading this review, you're a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot! I see if I can get a refund for it...EDIT: Wait! What! What! It ACTUALLY, finally managed to download the update after, like, 5-6 hours (and the verification of the game files). I might keep the game afterall (too much trouble trying to get a refund right now), but the review stays negative... All of this is just so sad, Age of Mythology is a really great game as long as it runs and doesn't crash or anything... ♥♥♥♥ing bugs! Made me think my harddrive was going to fail...EDIT: EDIT: FIX THE DAMN UPDATING ISSUE SO THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN!!			"

All i want is a working CD version or just someone to talk me through what could be wrong but that will not be the case. Do i recommend the game yes but be careful with the entire steam process as it is good and professional but for those who cannot just get a fix you can be very frustrated quickly.			"

While Skybox with AoM: EE doesnt really bring anything new to the table, it is still an incredibly fun game. The community got a much needed shot in the arm, and despite what many say, you can find people to play with if you are persistent enough. I am not sure if it is entirely worth the asking price, but if this gem ever goes on sale, pick it up, even if only for the campaign. This game has given me 100s of hours of enjoyment in its day, and I am sure that it will continue to provide many more with this new release.			"

												DOES NOT WORK!I'll make something clear as day before we get into the details. I really like Age of Mythology, it's a classic RTS game with a lot of fun gameplay to offer however my negative review is regarding the terrible handling of this updated edition.Somehow a team of devs have managed to update an old♥♥♥♥♥game, add their own DLC to it and break it in the process, I can't even access the launcher now and after several attempts to fix I'm nowhere closer to being able to play it. The worst part of all this is that I have played over 2 hours before the update ruined everything so Steam will not refund me for this purchase. While I applaud Steams concept of a 2 hour refund on any game purchase what has happened here gets around that standard practice by the dev patching the game into a buggy and non working state after the fact.Don't give your money to this company, they have made no solid effort to fix the games problems and post the most generic of solutions on the forums which don't even fix the issue.

												I've logged more time in AoM than probably any other game ever... except maybe Skyim.This is the end-all-be-all of RTS for me.  I've played every AoE game, Warcraft 2 and 3, and countless hours of Starcraft 2.  Age of Mythology wins.The races have drastic differences in appearance, economy, and combat function.  Combat is more economy focused than Starcraft and Warcraft.  If you've ever played an Age of Empires game than you have a basic understanding of what you're in for, but add way more variety in the races from square 1, add unique research abilities based on the gods you worship, and god powers that can drastically shift the battle at any second.

												Having played almost 70 hours in the first month of owning this game, I can assure you all that I am dismayed that there are those negative reviews at the top of the steam page. I almost didn't buy AOM because of them, and this is downright the most fun game I've played in YEARS. It is a nearly perfect game, the online matching system is phenomenal and virtually every aspect of the game is excellent. Once every couple of games you will disconnect but hey this is a ten year old game, what did you expect? Twenty out of 10 stars, this is a MUST-BUY game.

												I recommend this game hugely. The mix of the usual RTS with all the Mythological other things really create an interesting game. I do have one problem though. The original gmae used to give you the actual mythological information about all the things in the game. But overall very fun. I just wish that was still in the game. Other than that the game I feel is very very fun.			"

												I highly recommend this game, it is one of my comfort games, and the best $20 dollars my parents spent on me, back in 2006. I have played for hours and hours. Played the whole story through and through at least four times.I love this, and cannot speak highly enough of it. I've always played as an Egyptian, my favorite, and also my strength.   A great story, campaign engrossing.The only thing I will say, is as this is a remastering, it does have a few glitches here and there, but nothing that hinders the game play. You cannot easily build a map, like you could in the disk version. But, life goes on. I am just so happy to play this game again! Buy it, and I hope we'll do battle someday!			"

												Single player: RECOMMENDED! No the graphics aren't modern. This is a classic game. One I happened to have missed. And it is awesome good fun, if you like this genre and/or the mythology theme. AoM can be pretty challenging, too. I can't imagine playing on the highest difficulty atm. Which means there is someone out there that will LOVE this game for the challenge that would offer.LAN/multiplayer: NOT RECOMMENDED! OMFG WHYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?! /emocide! /homocide!! /genociduhduhduhduh!!! ... /flop!!!1 Yea, it *is* that bad.  Still. Yes. Still that bad. If they haven't fixed it yet, I seriously question if they will fix this ever. Yes, that is sad, since the multiplayer aspect is the whole reason for the extended edition reissue.Any game starts off okay, but as soon as you guys begin to progress at all the game begins to hang/stutter a bit, then it hangs like crazy for 30 seconds at a time and eventually someone will just get booted altogether, which completely ruins the game.It does not matter if you have a decent (or better) gaming rig and a good internet connection set up for a multi-gamer household. I don't know what they messed up, but they did mess something up badly and it makes LAN unplayable. I assume multiplayer (online) would be even worse since I can't even play duo with someone on LAN.			"

												I've logged more time in AoM than probably any other game ever... except maybe Skyim.This is the end-all-be-all of RTS for me.  I've played every AoE game, Warcraft 2 and 3, and countless hours of Starcraft 2.  Age of Mythology wins.The races have drastic differences in appearance, economy, and combat function.  Combat is more economy focused than Starcraft and Warcraft.  If you've ever played an Age of Empires game than you have a basic understanding of what you're in for, but add way more variety in the races from square 1, add unique research abilities based on the gods you worship, and god powers that can drastically shift the battle at any second.

												Where do i start?Why change what isnt broken? The game has lost half of its awesome features through trying to 'improve it'You cant create a team to do a 2v2 or 3v3 RANKED game anymore. The chat has been squeeze into the bottom of the screen and not a seperate tab.Bring back the original features that the disk version had.Also loading the games that are hosted to play is so unreliable all the time so you have to be lucky to even see the games.Not worth the money, wouldrather of spent it on the CD version even if it did end up costing more.If this game is improved and brought closer back to the older stype i would recommend it.

 Masterpiece. Age of Mythology was the first game I ever played seriously. The interesting and diverse gameplay, the deceptively complex game mechanics, and the lovely graphics for the era all make for a game that is thrilling and incredibly fun to play.This game has a certain charm about it; perhaps because of my experiences playing this game. The graphics may not be those of Fallout 4, The Witcher, or other such Triple-A Titles, but the gamemplay more than makes up for this. A lot of Age of Mythology's fun and diverse gameplay comes from its roster of incredibly diverse pantheons, and within those different gods that have different specialties. No two matches are the same, and playing with friends is incredibly fun.Overall, Age of Mythology was a major part of my childhood and I enjoy it to death. I could not recommend this game more, and it holds a special place in my heart. "

												==About the game in general==Age of Mythology is an awesome game... I had a lot of fun back in the ESO days, with tons of scenarios, friendly and good players .The steam version is basically the same game with only a few small things improved, But some problems still remains on the game, like DC's out of nowhere or one player can lag the whole game for everyone.And the launch... Don't even talk about the launch... It was a mess...  The launch scared a lot of people (that explains why the game had a low pop of players in the past months), but for a good reason... It was almost unplayable for a good amount of people. But, at least, they released a lot of fixes.It is somewhat playable... But yeah... you can still get DC from the match and the netcode in general they didn't improved that much, one player can still lag the match. I hope they keep releasing more fixes.I recommend the game, but just remind what i said about those multiplayer issues... They still happen. Edit: The new ""expansion"" increased the MP DC's and bugs. Beware.==About the new content and exclusive steam version patchs==They made some balance changes to the steam version. That is awesome, the game needed it, because a few gods were dominant, like zeus or isis. They gave some needed buffs and nerfs.Now about the ""expansion"". I haven't bought the ""expansion"", but i'm not sure if i will buy it now (will wait a 75% sale). The idea was good, but the final result is pretty mediocre. Some units are just reskins from vanilla/titan units, and units with unique models are pretty bad. It feels like a paid amateur mod.It seems like they didn't put a good effort on it and released it too soon. For now, i'm more happy about the balance changes and i hope they fix the new civilization (op units, bugs, awful models and god portraits).			"

The game also continuously drops framrate to an almost unplayable extent, even though I have a high end computer.Again, its a good game. It just needs a patch to help with the multiplayer conectivity. Do not buy until this happens.			"

												This has got to be one of my all time favorite games, an easy top 10 series (and I have been gaming for about 20 years +).  I have been playing this sinec the beta released!  Yes, that many years ago.  I still have my original discs for them and expansion.  Why buy this again on Steam!?  Because its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and I believe in supporting the companies you like.  Considering I have gotten several thousand hours of fun play time out of this, yes, they earned another sale from me.  So many different ways you can go and play with friends.  Titan challenges are fun as well.  One of my all time best was a rush with Odin winning in 10 minutes (killing all units and buildings), and making a hard mode CPU forfit in 8.  Not saying I am the worlds best, but this is such a great classic.  9/10 (no game is perfect).			"

												I cannot believe I have to give this a negative review.. This was a MARVELOUS game, but Microsoft has proven it likes to take games and mold them into a money printer. And that's what this game turned into. This game has almost no support form my recent beginning to play the game. There is much to despair over multiplayer and this is very unfortunate.My reasons Extended Edition should not be bought:-Lag across the board in multiplayer, regardless of how beefy your computer is, online or LAN-God Powers can desync Online games and make it easy to abuse ranking-Conversion of old maps is made incredibly difficult due to the addition of some stupid 'Alfred' unit-There is no report button anywhere, so if you're getting trolled/bashed, you have to cope or stop playing online-Single Player shows it's problems in cutscenes. Wrong Angles or complete terrain obscurity.-HD simply means, you can't find the fish while trying to fish. And a useless Day/Night cycle, that is never used.-Sometimes things happen for no good reasons, such as finishing a Titan Gate and it disapears.I bought this to relive a classic and play online, sadly, this wasn't the case. Skybox games should never be purchased. "

												This is a very bad remake of a very, very good game. I am utterly floored at how poorly optimized and broken the new graphical effects are. In like for like situations, this new version runs substantially worse than the original on far better hardware than was available at the time. There are missing, or incorrectly formatted graphical effects and textures, and all sorts of issues that cause crippling lag, which, when combined with the abyssmal netcode, make for an extremely frustrating experience. I love AoM but this port is an unoptimized, pathetic mess.			"

												Played this game when it was first released and loved it. I think this was the game that got me into playing RTS's. Played lots of different ones over the years but this one has always remained a favourite. I often hoped (and still do) that AOM 2 might be in the making. So i was over the moon when i saw this was going to be re-released.....a chance for the Phoenix to rise from the ashes once again and burn my enemies to the ground.If you haven't played this before don't expect an amazing graphical experience. The graphics have been improved, the sound aswell.....but the reason to play this is for the enjoyment. Its simple to pick up and play. However, experienced RTS gamers who haven't yet tried it, might find it too basic.Still, it's a classic and deserves a place in the RTS hall of fame.LAZER CROCS FTW			"

												I own AOE: Gold Edition and before that I owned the Titans Expansion + Regular game before I lost it. I would have clocked up at least 500 hours in this game in my time. Just stating that in case my hours of game time will help you hold my review to a higher validity. This game is absolute favourite game from the ""Age Of..."" series. In my opinion this game is superior to any Age of Empires game available, even the second. In fact, this game is honestly superior to any RTS strategy game I've ever played.It has every feature from all of the other ""Age Of"" games and more. Mythical units? ♥♥♥♥ yes. Fantastic campaigns? ♥♥♥♥ yes. Amazing map editor and scenario creator? ♥♥♥♥ yes. TITANS? ♥♥♥♥ yes! Heroes? ♥♥♥♥ yes. 4 different unique races? ♥♥♥♥ yes. A new resource? ♥♥♥♥ yes. I could go on for ♥♥♥♥ing ever but I won't because spoilers. (I'm too lazy.)In my opinion, AOE2 is only more popular because it is simpler. This game has many, many more features than AOE2 and if you go from AOM to AOE you will start to miss a lot of the amazing features that you start to take for granted once you play AOM.Also the multiplayer in the game is very active.I whole heartedly recommend this game. It is worth well over 30 dollars.Oh, and check out AOMHeaven and share your created campaigns/scenarios/maps/AI's on there for other players to play!			"

Microsofts development teams for these extended and HD remakes really would benefit from graphic designers, artists or content designers.DOES includes:-Minor new graphics engine changes, allowed for bloom lighting and better day and night cylcing with dynamic shadows.-The options menu contains a few new features which allow the player to zoom the camera out a litte further.-Players have a feature which allows them to intergrate their twitch.tv streamingDOES NOT include:- update graphics, texture, models units or animations- additional gameplay content, game modes, factions,campaign missions or multiplayer map styles- multiplayer fixes, issues addressed- better UI support- better hotkey binding support- better AI and pathingOverall Rating: 3/10The game is still good fun, but unless purchased at the sale price of £5 it isn't worth buying. I'm enjoying the title and its steam intergration, however the game is lacking most features you might expect from an extended version of the game. There are no features included which will extend the life cycle of the title and with poor multiplayer support and a high price tag for an old title, ends up making this purchase only rewarding for those who want to play a classic real-time strategy game by themselves or with a friend at sale time.

												This is the game that sparked my love for both RTS and Greek mythology. I must have completed all the campaigns at least 5 times each. It is probably my most played game of all time, and had a profound impact on my life. This is a great HD remake too, with shinier graphics, dynamic lighting, mod support etc. Definitely worth buying.			"

												I have been enjoying this game for quite a long time. Bought the original edition in 2005 and a love affair began. This game is really one of the top RTS of all time with it's unique universe and time setting. The Ancient world has been never made before so nicely and I think several years after it's debut we can still say exactly the same. You have the stunning game modes, you have the outstanding editor, modding is pretty easy, just have a look at the biggets fan site (http://aom.heavengames.com/) where you can find plenty of help and of course the actual products of the hardworking modders. The Extended Edition brang back one of the things that I missed for a while, the Multiplayer mode. ESO was shut down and the game lost it's playerbase a bit, but the revival is finely made and hopefully we are going to see many new faces and of course the old ones. :) Other pro is the fantastic graphic effects. I never imagined that this edition will look that good after I saw the press release pictures. I can only recommend getting it as it's a game that you cant miss before you die.			"

												Age of Mythology was the number one game of my childhood, so when I saw an upcoming remake, I directly bought it, no matter the high cost at the time.After 40 hours of playing, I'm glad to say that the team of AoM:EE has done a great job of keeping the old atmosphere of the game by not changing much, however still making it better through the new functions and new graphics.The huge plus the extended edition delivers is Steam Integration - Finally, we have a functioning community which does not only consist of AoMHeaven, but of a better developed Steam Community with all the Steam Features. The Workshop grants great accessibility to Mods and the recent Updates, the Ranking system, the events and the loads of achievements guarantee long-term playability.The big question: Is it worth the money?If you enjoy real-time strategy and haven't played Age of Mythology before, I would highly recommend buying AoM:EE. It is THE classic real-time strategy game, which is, in my eyes, even better than Age of Empires and the EE with all its features is pretty cheap for a brand new strategy game for you, comparing it to other strategy games on the market.If you have already played AoM, I would not recommend buying it at its current price. It has many new features, but if you know the game already, it's just not worth the money.Buy it, but wait for a major sale.			"

												The Extended Edition. While it's the old game it has some new textures (and also an added expansion you can buy).However, I cannot recommend it. The main game is still pretty solid. However, some of the patches that came with the new expansion have broken the main game in some ways I cannot fathom how such errors are made (powers are added that aren't part of the main game to e.g. the Greek civ without having the Chinese expansion, relics without function or with another function then described, etc).Also the draw is higher then it should be, it really isn't efficiently coded for a users viewpoint.

												Age of Mythology has always been a great favourite of mine, wasted many thousands of hours on it (and in a good way) I even went as far to create a massive modification/overhaul of it called Expanded Mod for the Titans expansion.However Extended Edition is a very mixed bag, most of the time, the crappy work of the exe by Skybox Labs. and the code itself has caused many issues with lag, OOS etc overtime they have fixed this, but mostly because the small 1k community has coerced them into somewhat fixing it.  Rundown:PROS:+ All the Benefits of The Titans+ Four New Vanilla units (Patch 2.0 onwards) and 1 scenario editor/easter egg unit+ Addition of all extra-optional content by ES themself (Away from Home, +2 RMs, Golden Gift Campaign)+ Some Decent Balance+ Readdition of the Beta Ambient Lighting+ Improved Shadows (now dynamic, render based not .DCL/Texture files)+ Somewhat decent Mod Support, but... NEGS:- Crap Optimization, (run it with footprints + Amb Lights in 1024x768 should get around 45 FPS on most 2009 onwards Comps)- Nothing Spectacular content wise, if you know the Beta, AoE Twitch Livestreams, Alphas and Extra ES-made content.- Many Murky/Cloudy Textures, some texture stuff won't render correctly.- Eh Pathfinding- Still Needs a lot of fixing.- Lack of Dev Support- Almost no active communityYeah only 1k players play Online properly (even though there's 14k playing per 2 weeks, and only some 2-30 people playing non-private MP), even, also via the some 900,000+ purchases (roughly 27 million USD) Dev Support is really whack, so it's obvious that it's a money laundering scheme (MS is pretty infamous for that)Only get it, if your a non-Casual or below Age of Empires fan "

In game recording options let you easily save your games if you don't have any similar outside programs. Playing multiplayer is even easier, as you don't need to install outside clients.I would recommend this if you haven't owned the game or lost your copy, but otherwise, I would wait before getting this game. 8/10			"

												Just a warning to the people who play COH, Men of War: Assault Squad, DOW, Wargame: Red Dragon, etc. This isn't any of those games by a long shot. Not just graphically, but in the way it works. The way you build your economy matters. It can be tedious at times, but managing the economy the right way to get your units out and be aggressive has some appeal.The multiplayer somewhat good. The lobby is easy to navigate, and matches are quick to find. The games are RUINED by the TERRIBLE lag you get. Everything lags, and the more players you put in, the worse it gets. 1 v 1 has the game stuttering, 2 v 2 has the game going slo mo.Get it if you want a deeper RTS game that is dated, but still good.Pass if you want an action oriented RTS, with as little base building and economy as possible.

Never gets old I am not a hardcore competetive player but this is by far the best RTS the world has scene.

												It's a great re-release of Age of Mythology and the Titans expansion. With HD graphics and new light effects, it being all in one package (Instead of multiple discs) and the easy to use Steam operated multiplayer this game is a must buy if you are an aoe fan, and a worthwhile purchase if you're into rts.

												This was one of the few games that i could play for hours without ever getting bored back in the day. Amazing music, decent story and good graphics are included.There are some issues with lags and slowdowns, UI seems dated and units/buildings graphics could've been updated but other than that - this is still a solid strategy game, whether you want to play versus AI or people.Editor and steam workshop further enhances your experience and im sure people will come up with more mods to upgrade both graphics and gameplay.

												I hate to leave this review since AOM is definetly one of my favorite games (top 5 of all time) but this whole new HD release has been ridiculous. I own the (original) physical disk but since they were releasing this HD version I thought hey I'll buy it here it'll be great to have my old favorite with some shiny new polygons. They made it sound like they nearly redid the game updating the graphics (spoiler it looks almost the same as it used to) but that's neither here nor there you don't buy a 12 year old game for the graphics anyway right you buy it for the gameplay, well......Multiplayer, where to even begin. the short version is it doesn't work. The long version is it's bugged out something crazy random crashes, framedrops you name it. It can barely seem to hold a connection long enough to finish a match with someone. I personally got so fed up with this that I never succefully finished a multiplayer game which is awful because multiplayer back in the day was great. these bugs weren't an issue in the original versionok so just play the single player. Well about that. Sometimes the enemy will just stand next to you non hostile and let you kill them without fighting back at all, sometimes they'll be able to produce way more troops than they should be able to (but you cannot). Your own troops (and sometimes the enemy AI as well) will get stuck between walls or buildings and even if you manually control them they can't seem to figure out how to free themselves leaving forcing you to kill them.this problem is in the main campains as well and where also not in the original version. Finally the last straw that finally prompeted me to write this review the DLC. Now I was so excited when I heard they were making another DLC for this game especially somewhere in Asia, that has huge potiental with the possiblity of all new gods, models  and gameplay. Two out of 3 ain't bad I guess. Everything is a lazy retexture of the 1st expansion (the titans) and from what I've heard is basically a beta. I don't even own the thing so why is this my biggest issue? Because in the middle of playing the main single player campain an popup comes up telling me that I need to download the DLC to activate X (which being the orignial main campain shouldn't even need any DLC). This icon won't even let me exit it taking me to the ""main page"" with my real game still running in the background basically forcing me to watch my troops die. There seems to be no work around for this, no way to avoid it and no way to return to the game, which leads me to believe this is a compulsory $10 DLC. So yea all in all 9/10 exactly as I rememebered it with a few extra lines up until stage 27 then you can get ♥♥♥♥ed. TL;DR HD version is an embarassing buggy version of the original game with a required $10 DLC that if you don't buy will basically end your game but if you do buy will ruin it with glitches. Oh well, if you buy it I hope you don't enjoy multiplayer or finishing games. Edit: Just kidding do not buy this because of the required DLC you can no longer play the original main campain or the single player. Some stores (like office depot) are still selling the original disk with the titian expansion just go buy that.I wanted to make a quick update to this review since I like to play this game before I go to bed. I mean I used to whatever they did for the latest update makes the entire game♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed when you hit the Mythic age. I'm talking lag so bad the entire game is literally unplayable. I swear if I didn't love this game so much as a kid.......			"

												Age of Mythology has always been a great favourite of mine, wasted many thousands of hours on it (and in a good way) I even went as far to create a massive modification/overhaul of it called Expanded Mod for the Titans expansion.However Extended Edition is a very mixed bag, most of the time, the crappy work of the exe by Skybox Labs. and the code itself has caused many issues with lag, OOS etc overtime they have fixed this, but mostly because the small 1k community has coerced them into somewhat fixing it.  Rundown:PROS:+ All the Benefits of The Titans+ Four New Vanilla units (Patch 2.0 onwards) and 1 scenario editor/easter egg unit+ Addition of all extra-optional content by ES themself (Away from Home, +2 RMs, Golden Gift Campaign)+ Some Decent Balance+ Readdition of the Beta Ambient Lighting+ Improved Shadows (now dynamic, render based not .DCL/Texture files)+ Somewhat decent Mod Support, but... NEGS:- Crap Optimization, (run it with footprints + Amb Lights in 1024x768 should get around 45 FPS on most 2009 onwards Comps)- Nothing Spectacular content wise, if you know the Beta, AoE Twitch Livestreams, Alphas and Extra ES-made content.- Many Murky/Cloudy Textures, some texture stuff won't render correctly.- Eh Pathfinding- Still Needs a lot of fixing.- Lack of Dev Support- Almost no active communityYeah only 1k players play Online properly (even though there's 14k playing per 2 weeks, and only some 2-30 people playing non-private MP), even, also via the some 900,000+ purchases (roughly 27 million USD) Dev Support is really whack, so it's obvious that it's a money laundering scheme (MS is pretty infamous for that)Only get it, if your a non-Casual or below Age of Empires fan "

												After so many years the game has lost no charm, though it remains largely what it was before, except in one simple way, multiplayer. It adds a whole new challenge to the game, anyway, I aim this review at people who have never played the game before and are wondering ""is it for me?""Firstly, a huge part of this game (so huge they put it in the title) is mythology, it has rich, historically accurate features that really add to the game, you can train myth units, and you can also wield God powers, (send lightning down on enemies, and even make an earthquake right in your enemies base.) Before you start a game you have to choose a Major God, such as Zeus, Thor, Loki and others (a total of 12) your major God will determine what units, God Powers, and upgrades you will have.Gameplay - This is a Real time strategy game, one of the very best, you start with a few villagers who can build and gather resources (wood, food, and gold.) There are four ages in which you must advance, the archaic age, the classical age, the heroic age, and finally the mythic age. As you advance through the ages you'll unlock new military units (infantry, archers, and cavalry), as well as myth units (minoutaurs, centaurs, cyclops and loads of others.) Ultimatley your goal is pretty simple... Beat the other guy. Advance faster, make bigger armies, or win in other ways such as building a wonder and defending for ten minutes. So it's quite a tactical game. You can also, right at the end of the final age, build a titan, it is like it sounds, a massive thing that tramples cities like godzilla.Graphics - they're perfectly fine, and nothing more. There is violence in the forms of armies battling it out for domination, but nothing very gorey, and there is no bad language, unless you count ""Shkeepan"" (you'll understand that joke if you play the game""This is a great game, it has a little bit of a learning curve but can be picked up pretty quick, the best part is that even after so many hours, you still have so much to learn, it provides hours of fun. A couple of down sides - Price: £22.99 is a lot for a game that is 10 years old, don't get me wrong, I've paid more for newer games that aren't as good, but I think it's a little steep. Online games can be a little tough to come by, perhaps if they had a sale then more players would realise the quality of this game.			"

												Original game is great. Don't buy the extended edition.There are tons of gamebreaking bugs (e.g. constant desync issues in multiplayer, graphics bugs which make units invisible etc.)Since they brought out the Chinese DLC (which is horribly unbalanced and even more buggy than the rest of the game) I have not completed a single online match. It desyncs every time after just a few minutes or maybe if you're lucky after half an hour. There have been tons of bug reports to the developer team and none of these bugs have been fixed in over a year.There are people who apparently can't start the game because they didn't buy the dlc. (I can't comment on that because I wasted my money on the♥♥♥♥♥♥DLC)So there you go. As i loved the original so much,  I'm sad to say that you should under no circumstances buy the extended edition.

												A conversation between me and Cydran about Age of Mythology: Extended Edition.AA | Cydran: Was it as well remade as you expected?AA | Cydran: or as you were hoping?Veldar: Well.Veldar: It's the same game, just with the expansion I never got, it feels dated, I can tell there are flaws and comming from C&C generals, a much faster game AoM feels very slow to start, getting your economy right is essential which is fine but I prefer the mirco of C&C to the marco of AoM, but the game still has a special place in my heart as the first game I remember asking for and it being my first PC title.Veldar: I still love it though.AA | Cydran: Very nice. I assume that means that new players going into the version of AoM on Steam might not enjoy it as much as they would if they played the game in the past?Veldar: Well to make a judgement you have to put RTS into two piles:Veldar: Mirco and MarcoVeldar: Micro is the faster games C&C generals and Warcraft 3, matchs should last 5 - 15 minutes.Veldar: Where Macro, games like AoM, AoE 3 and SubCom are more about early economy and massing armies then pitting them against each other.AA | Cydran: I seeVeldar: I prefer Micro so a Macro game feels slower to me, I still very much enjoy it and I'll play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it but I know that it's not the best RTS by any means.

												UPDATED REVIEW:This game is still brilliant and it works like a charm. Now that im so many hours into playing I have a few things that I feel I should let you know about (These are just cosmetic issues FYI):1.) The devs of this version added in a new ""workers counter"" Which displays how many workers are gathering each resource, which is great EXCEPT when you get into the 10,000's of a resource, where the UI doesnt compensate and resize; the counter and the resource value overlap. Not an actual issue it just looks ugly.2.) The graphics have been played with and tweaked slightly and I run them at highest quality. The problem is that where in the original the environment looked lovely and smooth, sometimes in this vesion it can looks very square, again not an issue it just looks ugly.3.) In the write ups there are a few spelling mistakes I've found I dont know if that was this company or the orginal but still. 4.) The day and Night cycle seems pretty pointless to be honest with you, it doesnt really get that dark (obviously) and it often more than not doesnt work properly, instead of fading into darkness it just makes my game flash for a few minutes.Okay thats all really. As it said all cosmetic as I've had no real problems with the game, I just feel like they should be mentioned as they're only issues that exist in the Extended Edition.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I could write a 6 million word praise of this game, but I'll save us all the time and say this:MY FAVORITE GAME FROM CHILDHOOD HAS COME TO SSSTTTEEEAAAMMM!!! :D :D :D :DYeah, I love it! But I loved it before I played it, thanks devs!			"

Well worth the buy for the new content and being able to run on modern machines better (and better resolution!).

It's not just a small upgrade to an already solid product, it's a vast improvement built upon a solid foundation.All the old bugs that ruined the game have been squashed, the game itself comes bundled with the expansion and a host of new features. Still just as fun to learn this time around as it was then!So if you are a bit cautious, watch some Let's Play videos or ask people that have it or remember the good old days.

												I hate to leave this review since AOM is definetly one of my favorite games (top 5 of all time) but this whole new HD release has been ridiculous. I own the (original) physical disk but since they were releasing this HD version I thought hey I'll buy it here it'll be great to have my old favorite with some shiny new polygons. They made it sound like they nearly redid the game updating the graphics (spoiler it looks almost the same as it used to) but that's neither here nor there you don't buy a 12 year old game for the graphics anyway right you buy it for the gameplay, well......Multiplayer, where to even begin. the short version is it doesn't work. The long version is it's bugged out something crazy random crashes, framedrops you name it. It can barely seem to hold a connection long enough to finish a match with someone. I personally got so fed up with this that I never succefully finished a multiplayer game which is awful because multiplayer back in the day was great. these bugs weren't an issue in the original versionok so just play the single player. Well about that. Sometimes the enemy will just stand next to you non hostile and let you kill them without fighting back at all, sometimes they'll be able to produce way more troops than they should be able to (but you cannot). Your own troops (and sometimes the enemy AI as well) will get stuck between walls or buildings and even if you manually control them they can't seem to figure out how to free themselves leaving forcing you to kill them.this problem is in the main campains as well and where also not in the original version. Finally the last straw that finally prompeted me to write this review the DLC. Now I was so excited when I heard they were making another DLC for this game especially somewhere in Asia, that has huge potiental with the possiblity of all new gods, models  and gameplay. Two out of 3 ain't bad I guess. Everything is a lazy retexture of the 1st expansion (the titans) and from what I've heard is basically a beta. I don't even own the thing so why is this my biggest issue? Because in the middle of playing the main single player campain an popup comes up telling me that I need to download the DLC to activate X (which being the orignial main campain shouldn't even need any DLC). This icon won't even let me exit it taking me to the ""main page"" with my real game still running in the background basically forcing me to watch my troops die. There seems to be no work around for this, no way to avoid it and no way to return to the game, which leads me to believe this is a compulsory $10 DLC. So yea all in all 9/10 exactly as I rememebered it with a few extra lines up until stage 27 then you can get ♥♥♥♥ed. TL;DR HD version is an embarassing buggy version of the original game with a required $10 DLC that if you don't buy will basically end your game but if you do buy will ruin it with glitches. Oh well, if you buy it I hope you don't enjoy multiplayer or finishing games. Edit: Just kidding do not buy this because of the required DLC you can no longer play the original main campain or the single player. Some stores (like office depot) are still selling the original disk with the titian expansion just go buy that.I wanted to make a quick update to this review since I like to play this game before I go to bed. I mean I used to whatever they did for the latest update makes the entire game♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed when you hit the Mythic age. I'm talking lag so bad the entire game is literally unplayable. I swear if I didn't love this game so much as a kid.......			"

												The game is the same as the origonal realease, except with so many little bugs added in that it is truely infuriating trying to play. I really enjoyed Age Of Mythology so when I saw this I was rather excited, I expected it to be at least a slight improvement and was thouroughly dissapointed. I am glad I purchased this while it was on sale,  because I do not believe it is worth the full price. I regret paying even the $10 that I did.Please save yourself the time and money and just do not buy this. It is not worth it.			"

												They really needed to make sure this game was actually playable before releasing it. It requires a patch to even start, but then by applying that patch, I am unable to see my DLC. I wanted to get a refund in hopes to buy the extended edition and tales of the dragon seperately(because that worked for a friend) buut now they wont allow me to have a refund because I went over the 2 hour limit(which is just FANTASTIC because I spent most of that time in game trying to fix it, not play it.)So now im stuck with a busted game and absolutely no help.

												I'm intrigued by how the someone managed to take a game that ran perfectly and turn it into a complete lagfest despite everything appearing to be exactly the same.  It's a fun game but I'd probably recommend buying the original Age of Mythology instead if you can find a way to multiplay it using a VPN or whatever.			"

												This game was fine for the most part. I sadly experienced a lot of lag because I only have 2GB RAM, while the recommended are 4GB RAM, but it didn´t make the game unplayable.The last two levels of the ""Fall of the Trident"" were very buggy. Even with a wall, the enemy still would go through it without destroying it, and after I won the last level, my screen went black and I was only able to go back to the Windows screen by shutting down computer by force.The cutscenes seem to go ""underground"", whenever a character has to be shown in a close up. Something that didn´t happen on the original game. All in all, while this game has the Titans expansion (which I never played) and improved graphics, it isn´t worth 30U$D + 10U$D for the DLC, maybe 20U$D for everything would have been better, considering also the reviews for the DLC.I enjoyed it, but I don´t fully recommend it.[EDIT, March 3 2016:] This game just isn´t even worth 8U$D. Bugs started accumulating since yesteday: 1) Relics which instead of having bonuses for units have god powers (Pestilence).2) My walls have the earthquake power.3) Black boxes which summed up the unit´s strength/weakness disappeared.4) Enemy units going through my walls without destroying them.5) Available god powers having a different name (E.G: Prosperity has the name of an Odin´s relic bonus).

												Age of Mythology is a timeless RTS where players use their devotion and skill to ruin their enemies. It features a selection of Major Gods to choose from and then a series of Minor Gods to select as you advance through the ages, increasing the technologies and favour bestowed upon you. From humble beginnings with villagers struggling to gather food in the Archaic Age to armies of heroes, mythical creatures and human soldiers striding through vast empires in the Mythic Age, Ensemble Studios created a masterful entry into the 'Age of Empires' series that commands respect. Unfortunately, this rendition of the game is not the work of Ensemble Studios. In Age of Mythology: Extended Edition, the developers have criminally neglected it, this old masterwork riddled with connectivity issues and bugs that render it near-unplayable that weren't in the game before. The new Chinese civilisation, albeit well-designed mechanically, suffers from nearly all of its units being cheap re-textures of existing assets. If you can find a copy of the original game, there's an active community on there using a program to play online called ""Voobly."" So, if you wish to try Age of Mythology, that would be my recommendation. Try and cirvumvent this so-called ""Extended Edition"" if you can.In conclusion, this is a game many of us remember fondly. In the state it's currently in however, I'm sorry to say that it's better left alone until its current developers show it some more care.			"

												     tl;dr- Don't buy this game until the company that picked it up publicly apologizes for their bad buisness practices and actually fixes them.     Okay, this is coming from someone who owned AoMG back when it was still run by ESO. It was one of my favorite games, with tons of hours of content. It had a massive modding, and map making support and a huge number of people took advantage of this. I would always rebuy it because I wasn't paying 10$ for one game, I was paying 10$ for an infinite number. That praise isn't even mentioning the base game, with a large number of civilizations and different strategies for each. Age of Mythology Gold is an excellent game and I strongly recommend you pick it up.      The Extended Edition that steam sells is not. There has been a little bit of confusion as to who actually is running the servers and support for the Extended Edition, although the latter may be a bit of a misnomer as Age of Mythology Extended Edition is rife with errors, bugs, and inconsisntencies. There are a kalidescope of problems that can occur during a game session to cause it to crash, from disconnections (which effect a single person) to desync. For the most part the cult following on Steam has bore these burdens with resignation. They make jokes at the expense of the servers and MS Ryzon (Ex-Developer for The Extended Edition) is actually featured as a boss in one scenario. The bosses' talent? He cause lag and steals money.      We were however content to have a medium which we could play our game on once again even if this medium was buggier than an anteater's lunch infected with crabs. This changed with the recent release of the Tale of the Dragon DLC. For 10$, one could unlock the Chinese Civilization. The quality of this expansion is such, that MOST players believe it simply to be a monotized mod for the game, and a poorly done one at that. The mod plays like already existing civilizations and brings little unique to the table. What it does bring however, is a host of new errors to the game. Chat in pregame lobbies no longer work, desyncs have become far more common, and players are constantly reminded by game breaking pop-up ads to purchase the expansion pack every time a player of the Chinese Civilization does, well, anything.       The most serious problem however has appeared. Custom games no longer appear on the list of available games as they are constantly being ""retreived"". This has rendered the largest attraction to the AoM experience completely unplayable. When I went to report this error to the support page, I found it broken. The Support page. Purchasing DLC is still entirely functional but attempting to to get game fixing support is impossible due to a broken link. That's the real reason for this review.The reason the player base is so frustrated isn't the errors in the game, it's the complete contempt of the paying consumers that is ultimately driving players from this game. I've asked dozens of people in the base if they have a favorable opinion of the hoster of this game. Not one single person has a favorable opinion or at very least neutral opinion of this game's hoster. The real kicker? This game was hosted 10 years ago by Ensemble Studios Online (from the makers of Halo Wars) and ran much smoother then. A company that has since collapsed was objectively more sucessful than both Steam and Skybox when it comes to smoothly running this game.    SkyBox, if you're reading this. You need to apologize to the players of this game for bad support, bug fixes and a DLC that has only exacerbated the problem. AoM is not a difficult game to run, and it has a lot to offer to all bases. But if your inability to fix basic game errors keeps driving off old players, you'll end up with a game that has no replayablity whatsoever especially when compared to the new generation of turn-based strategy.

												Don't by this piece of rubbish game. I will say it IS fun WHEN IT WORKS. Online games desync about 50% of the time, at various points in the match. Considering some of these matches are RANKED, or take ONE TO TWO HOURS to play, it is frustrating when it ""desyncs"" an hour into a good match.The verdict: don't buy. You'll just end up frustrated like me.PS: google search of ""age of mythology desync issue"" yields several threads of complaints back in 2013 and 2014. This issue must have been going on for a while, and it is still not fixed in 2016. Don't waste your $7 unless you want to play a glitchy game or the single-player campaign.			"

												Original game is great. Don't buy the extended edition.There are tons of gamebreaking bugs (e.g. constant desync issues in multiplayer, graphics bugs which make units invisible etc.)Since they brought out the Chinese DLC (which is horribly unbalanced and even more buggy than the rest of the game) I have not completed a single online match. It desyncs every time after just a few minutes or maybe if you're lucky after half an hour. There have been tons of bug reports to the developer team and none of these bugs have been fixed in over a year.There are people who apparently can't start the game because they didn't buy the dlc. (I can't comment on that because I wasted my money on the♥♥♥♥♥♥DLC)So there you go. As i loved the original so much,  I'm sad to say that you should under no circumstances buy the extended edition.

												Age of Mythology has always been a great favourite of mine, wasted many thousands of hours on it (and in a good way) I even went as far to create a massive modification/overhaul of it called Expanded Mod for the Titans expansion.However Extended Edition is a very mixed bag, most of the time, the crappy work of the exe by Skybox Labs. and the code itself has caused many issues with lag, OOS etc overtime they have fixed this, but mostly because the small 1k community has coerced them into somewhat fixing it.  Rundown:PROS:+ All the Benefits of The Titans+ Four New Vanilla units (Patch 2.0 onwards) and 1 scenario editor/easter egg unit+ Addition of all extra-optional content by ES themself (Away from Home, +2 RMs, Golden Gift Campaign)+ Some Decent Balance+ Readdition of the Beta Ambient Lighting+ Improved Shadows (now dynamic, render based not .DCL/Texture files)+ Somewhat decent Mod Support, but... NEGS:- Crap Optimization, (run it with footprints + Amb Lights in 1024x768 should get around 45 FPS on most 2009 onwards Comps)- Nothing Spectacular content wise, if you know the Beta, AoE Twitch Livestreams, Alphas and Extra ES-made content.- Many Murky/Cloudy Textures, some texture stuff won't render correctly.- Eh Pathfinding- Still Needs a lot of fixing.- Lack of Dev Support- Almost no active communityYeah only 1k players play Online properly (even though there's 14k playing per 2 weeks, and only some 2-30 people playing non-private MP), even, also via the some 900,000+ purchases (roughly 27 million USD) Dev Support is really whack, so it's obvious that it's a money laundering scheme (MS is pretty infamous for that)Only get it, if your a non-Casual or below Age of Empires fan "

												After so many years the game has lost no charm, though it remains largely what it was before, except in one simple way, multiplayer. It adds a whole new challenge to the game, anyway, I aim this review at people who have never played the game before and are wondering ""is it for me?""Firstly, a huge part of this game (so huge they put it in the title) is mythology, it has rich, historically accurate features that really add to the game, you can train myth units, and you can also wield God powers, (send lightning down on enemies, and even make an earthquake right in your enemies base.) Before you start a game you have to choose a Major God, such as Zeus, Thor, Loki and others (a total of 12) your major God will determine what units, God Powers, and upgrades you will have.Gameplay - This is a Real time strategy game, one of the very best, you start with a few villagers who can build and gather resources (wood, food, and gold.) There are four ages in which you must advance, the archaic age, the classical age, the heroic age, and finally the mythic age. As you advance through the ages you'll unlock new military units (infantry, archers, and cavalry), as well as myth units (minoutaurs, centaurs, cyclops and loads of others.) Ultimatley your goal is pretty simple... Beat the other guy. Advance faster, make bigger armies, or win in other ways such as building a wonder and defending for ten minutes. So it's quite a tactical game. You can also, right at the end of the final age, build a titan, it is like it sounds, a massive thing that tramples cities like godzilla.Graphics - they're perfectly fine, and nothing more. There is violence in the forms of armies battling it out for domination, but nothing very gorey, and there is no bad language, unless you count ""Shkeepan"" (you'll understand that joke if you play the game""This is a great game, it has a little bit of a learning curve but can be picked up pretty quick, the best part is that even after so many hours, you still have so much to learn, it provides hours of fun. A couple of down sides - Price: £22.99 is a lot for a game that is 10 years old, don't get me wrong, I've paid more for newer games that aren't as good, but I think it's a little steep. Online games can be a little tough to come by, perhaps if they had a sale then more players would realise the quality of this game.			"

												Like Age of Empires II HD Edition, if you've played Age of Mythology (and enjoyed the experience), you're going to enjoy the Extended Edition.

Although I haven't put a lot of time into it, multiplayer seems to be rather rough around the edges. Constant lag and crashes are an ever-present issue.			"

												Age of Mythology, a game a lot of people remember as a fun, intense and challencing game right out of childhood. I recall it as one of the first games I ever played.I've heard critics say that this version of the game is just a graphical facelift, and that it's way too overpriced for an old title.I on the other hand think the exact opposite. I think that the game is the same game, but that makes me happy, as I can relive my childhood in it.I think the adaptation of Steam Workshop, and the new way of making Mods to the game, could breed some pretty interesting mods.Yes it has it's flaws, it's bound to have.

												This game is to me what money is to the rich. It has given me fun, it has given me rage, it has given me a great Time.And now, that I come to get it on Steam, Thanks to a friend of mine for buying it, I realize, that like Money, Sometimes, it just runs out. I have no doubt the game is still as Great, or Even Better, Don't get me wrong on that; But this new DLC... Everytime,And that is after doing god's work to try every single different scenario. Every single time I launch a Random Map or Multiplayer Match, Same with Campaigns, I always get a Game Breaking error, Saying that the ''cUnitTypeChineseVillager'' has not been found in my game files. The game proceeds to kill all units, Including trees and Animals, and all Buildings in the game, and it's basically a Lose/Lose for all. I don't know if it's the Chinese DLC or the game itself being Ruined. But I do Know one thing, As it is right now, this is not the game that saw me get interested in Mythology or any RTS for that matter.Even when I love AoM more than anything, I can't recommend this game. Not Until it works for me...UPDATE: All said before, Scratch it (The Bad Parts) I actually got in Contact with the Support team, whom, In less than 48 Hours released a patch and fixed my problem. I must say, Whitout a doubt, that the Team Behnd the game right Now it's the best part of EE. Thanks SkyLabs!			"

(All which have been recreated)the multiplayer alone made me buy this game and i glad to say it hasn't disappointent me.As far as i can tell 80% of the players are from the old days like me and know there way around the game, so don't expect to buy it and destory everyone instantly the game takes getting use to and in my opinion is a one of a kind game.Side Note, This game dosen't have a massive community as i would of expected but still this game draws me in everytimeHighly Recommended!

												This the best Real Time Strategy game i have played by far it's nothing but Awesome...the mechanics of game at the start may seem really simple and easy to master but as soon as you hit the online it becomes crystal clear that there is more to the game that meets the eye..Feel The Tension, The Excitement, The Rage, The Dissapointment, The Thrill, Taste The Sweet Nector Of Victory or Bitter Taste Of Defeat or Rage and Curse that one freaking moron who is always there in your team in a team game who plays worse than your 80 years old grandma....All in Age of Mythology			"

												I remember the original game very fondly from my childhood and I'm very glad they haven't messed around with it too much. The biggest issue with the original was the broken online multiplayer system which I'm more than happy to say has been fixed with the Steam integration. Amazing game, 10/10.			"

												I bought the DLC & the game became un-playable (as many have stated before).1.- The Chinese Animation gets stuck and there´s no way to close it without closing the whole game.2.- When choosing the Chinese for a private match, at the beginning of the match appears an error saying the ""Chinese Peasant could not be loaded"", the Urban Center automatically destroys itself and the match finishes.I honestly didn´t want to continue playing the game to disappoint me anymore.I expected the DLC so much and the game became un-playable.

This is an honest review on Age of Mythology: Extended Edition.First off, a couple sentences about me so you know who this review is comming from.I started this game when I was 3 and my dad was playing it and he got me into it (it was escpecially fun because I am Greek and this helped me out in Mythology so when I went to 3rd grade in the Mythology class I literally knew everything even if some things arent 100% accurate to real mythology). I started the original version that came out in, I believe, 2001. Fast-forward a couple of years and I got the Titans version of the game bringing a whole newfaction (I will get into factions later). I lost the game when my old 9 year old laptop broke and I got it back some time ago when it went on a steam sale for 7 Euros. If the non-steam versions of the game tracked my hours aswell, I would easily have more than 1500.The main idea of the gameThe game is an RTS (Real time strategy), you get to command your villagers to gather resources, make your town, your army and even your navy and fight to the death with your enemies!You can choose in between 5 factions (Greek, Egyptian, Norse, Atlantean and Chinese)Every faction has 3 different ""Main gods"" (ex. Greeks have Zeus, Poseidon and Hades)Every faction and main god has a few different upsides and downsides. (ex. Hades has very good archers)There are 4 types of resources used to upgrade units,buildings and much more, Wood, Food, Gold and Favor (Favor is used to create mythical units like Minotaurs or get some God-Specific upgrades)You can also advance to different ages if you have the right resources( Archaic -> Classic -> etc (I typed this because I dont remember the names lol)When advancing to a new age you can select some ""sub-gods"" like Aphrodite or Hermes which all give different upgrades and myth units (ex. Athena gives Minotaurs) and ofcourse a god-power that is 1-use on most factions (ex. Ares gives the ""pest"" power which is used on enemy ""unit-producing"" buildings will make them unable to produce units for a short time.Those were the gameplay basicsThe current state of the game/communityThe game was created in 2001 as I said before. It was pretty succesful and a very fun RTS game.A few years later the ""Titans"" update came out (I believe this was around 2006).The titans update added some cool new features and a whole new faction, the Atlanteans!And after that. The game basically died. The developers company disbanded and the game and community was left in avery bad spot. Then at 2014 ""Extended edition"" came out on steam. It had its upsides and downsides. The majority of the community sticked to titans. That remained this way until 2015 where a new update came out. It added the Chinese faction and a whole new campaign with like 15 levels.The campaign was overall bad and all the myth units/gods felt really rushed and overpowered. The new designs for some myth units were litteraly other myth units recolored with a dragon head which spitted fire that could destroy any building in like 2 seconds. Very overpowered and not fun.That was for the ""updates"" part of the game. Now we will talk about the community which is basically dead. If you are on the game you will see that there are only like 25 people online at all times so its nearly impossible to get an online game unless you like to wait for like 3 hours or can convince some of your friends to get this game.The ratingsGraphics: 6.5 (For a very old game the graphics arent bad, but the bad graphics also have an upside of some sort since even lower end PC's can run it.)Campaign: 8/10 (The campaign is amazing to say the least. Personally for me it gave me nostalgia after playing it again after 8 years but if you are an RTS player you will definetly like the campaign)Community: 6/10 (The community at its current state isnt very good. The easiest way and probably the only way to play online currently is with friends,(The offline isnt very bad either tho, the bots especially on higher difficulties can  show a big challenge))Gamemodes: 8/10 (I would have combined gamemodes with the community but AoM is the type of game that you can literally make anything out of, a few examples: Roleplay, Settlers, a map of litterally THE WHOLE WORLD YOU CAN PLAY ON and much more)OVERALL RATING FOR AOM:EE : 7.5/10ConclusionIf you are an old player who played the titans version and possibly even the original you should give this game a try but maybe when its on a sale when its usually on 7 Euros.For new players seeing this game for the first time: If you are interested on this game you can read some more reviews or watch some youtube videos of it to get you to try it out, or if you have friends who are also interested in this game, get it on a sale if you have the money to spare and enjoy the game with your friends for guaranteed hours of fun! Good luck!			"

												This game has always been amazing, and I love it to death. However, the Extended Edition us EXTREMELY prone to crashing mid game in multiplayer. This has lead to many heated games being abruptly ended by game breaking crashes, which ruins it very quickly. Awesome game, but don't expect multiplayer to be reliable at this stage.Fix the bugs devs!			"

												The best RTS of all time for macro-oriented players. Has some wonky meta-game mechanics but the game is truely legendary because of them. The 30$ release price is high, even for a fan of the series (I have 3 physical copies) but the revival of official multiplayer and integradtion of mods was worth it.			"

Improvements such as steam integration and native multiplayer are as much fantastic additions as the recently enhanced lighting and graphics effects. With a simple tutorial for new players and three immersive campaigns, I intend on spending as many hours on this improved edition as I did on the original in my childhood.

												First, I'll save you some time: If you've never played Age of Mythology and like RTS games, this is definitely worth your money.  Buy it.For everyone else.  This game is a bit buggy right now, and the graphics my computer will allow is about the same as the original game had (so poor optimization of the code, I'd say), but then again I'm on a laptop with a very poor graphics card.  For anyone with real power in their computer, I expect this would look amazing, so that's nice.The gameplay is still fantastic.  Best RTS in my opinion.  I haven't tried the multiplayer, so I don't know how good or bad it is.  Sorry.  The original multiplayer was quite fun.If you still own the original game, don't buy this.  Go to Voobly and have fun there.  This new edition adds...basically nothing, other than smoke and mirrors.  I wish you luck with your decision!  Maybe we can play sometime =)			"

												This is a bit of a mixed bag here... Age of Mythology was one of the best, if not the best, real time strategy games of all time.  The expansion was incredible, and the extended edition adds some really cool stuff (the day/night cycle is beautiful!)  But to release a 12 year old game for $30 and not bother to fix bugs before releasing it?  The word scam comes to mind...  What possible explanation could there be for 'rushing' the re-release of a game from a dozen years ago?  If it were only Steam integration issues, it'd be less shameful, but things like memory leaks and texture issues should have fixed BEFORE charging anyone money for it.  I'd wait until they fix more bugs and it goes on sale for 75% off.  That said, if the thought of playing a modernized version of such a spectacular game is just too tempting to wait on, you won't be disappointed.  I haven't found the bugs to be too bad and the Steam Workshop is, as always, full of amazingness and growing quickly.			"

												My playtime on steam doesn't even begin to touch the amount of playtime I ahve in this since I used to own the game on disk waaaay back in the day [I can probably still find it if I really tried too] But if you like RTS then you should absolutely get this- if you don't already have it. It's a fantastic game and one that even someone not super good at RTS can enjoy [IE: Me. I'm so bad I have to play everything on easy. Eventually I'll get better.] The campain is incredible in my opinion, I enjoy it immesily. It's a interesting way to make the player try every civilization- AND the story ain't awful if I'm being honest. I mean I didn't buy this game for the story, that was just a super awesome added bonus. I mean if you had to point out the flaws it may as well bethat yes the graphics are dated. It looks like it hasn't aged very gracefully, even with touched up graphics. Even so I find the graphics charming, they're simple enough to get the point across and they do that fairly well [I mean sometimes it's funny for a character to scream in a cutscene and their expression doesn't change. Maybe that's just me.] One of the only frustrating things is that the AI can be a bit buggy sometimes least in my efforts. Maybe I really do just suck at the game. And this is incredibly minor but those sayings that the units will yell when they're selected and moved do get old pretty fast. It's a minor complaint though, the game is still super worth it. [Be prepared to hear BUT before I let this get super long! Definitely get the game if you're a fan of RTS! Or Mythology! Or you really wanna check out something that's pretty darn fun. I love this game and I know I've rambled to my friends about it enough. I will add: I never played online. That seems to be another major complaint from people. As someone who does suck at the game I'm not thinking of trying it soon. But, everything outside that seems pretty awesome to me! 10/10 would recommend to all.			"

												Age of Mythology has a tremendous amount of depth to it, and it would be  a shame for it to be down-rated due to poor graphics or other such novelties. The original developers really put a lot of thought into the economy, dynamics of civilizations, war play tactics, and ensuring that its consumers have the ability to run away with their imaginations in their map making sandbox. Many people tend to look over the small details that makes this game great, which is unfortunate. This game offers not only a  variety of extremely dynamic civilizations with varying god powers, strengths, and both passive/active procs such as priest that convert wild animals, buildings that when razed spawn militia, sky passages, and etc. But, it also provides great depth in the everyday game play. For example, ranged units generally have percent based accuricies that generally drop when against a moving target (which allows for great micro management in battles and a depth of skill and dynamic to warfare), cetain units have differents strengths and weaknesses, myth units come with a great varity of abilities that range from healing, to freezing, to acids spit, and the ability to eat trees or gold mines to heal oneself. There is also dynamic source of resources that vary with which the speed one can gather them and the amount they come in.And as I mentioned before, u have access to a map making sandboxes, and many players have created all types of scenerios such as SettlersZeldaNeo mutationBlood CastleRole Playing  MapsEscapeZonesand much more for different playing styles/modes.Now I have only touched the Iceburg, but I hope u get the chance to see the potential in the game, and the communities within it.

												This is why I don't like Steam reviews; You can't have a middling opinion. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is, at it's heart, the same good game we loved to play years ago. Pitting (mostly) real world civilizations with their own mythological flairs against each other to have a winner takes all brawl. Seeing cyclops throw men around like ragdolls or the villagers of an enemy die when you summon the cold horrors of Fimbulwinter will never get old. The problem is; The price and the DLC. I've heard MANY complaints over the multiplayer, but I don't play the multiplayer. Carrying on...The price of AoM: EE is far too much unless it's on sale. What (exactly) came into the brains of the people who fixed the price is beyond me. I can only assume someone fell asleep at the switch as this game should always be a cool $10 at most. Now onto the DLC; It reeks of mediocrity and is basically a fanmade piece, and not a particularly good fanmade one either. Look at the wonder that have been done with Wars of iberty for Age of Empires 3 to see what I mean; It's basically a small team of guys who poured themselves into research, polish, and creativity and came out with a winner. The guys who made Tales of the Dragon came up with a load of uninspired units and gardens, which are like many mini Vaults of Plenty (An end-game God power that nets you a trickle of resources; See how that can be overpowered)?The game itself is great, what they ask for it and what (new) things they've offered isn't. Don't get suckered in for full price, wait for a sale like I did.			"

												An RTS game where you get to lead armies supported by the creatures of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse Mythology? ♥♥♥♥ING SOLD.I did play the original version of this game... so many years ago. While it did not capture me quite like Age of Empires II did, AoM was still pretty good. In this remade version... well I don't really see any changes from the original, except for stuff like Steam support, being able to run on modern OS', and the usual stuff you see when an old game is remade for the present day. All important, of course, but for those who have already played AoM, there isn't really anything new here.As usual, I stuck to single-player since I'm a terrible online RTS player. The main campaign here drags on a bit long, but it is still plenty good and worthy of the Age RTS series. The expansions' campaigns, which I had never played until now, were also pretty neat in their own way. I still prefer AoE II's campaigns, but... nothing really beats those in my book. I am biased. XDUltimately, it's just good old RTS fun, except this time you can literally storm your enemies with Hydras, Anubites, or Valkyries instead of the usual hordes of spearmen, archers, and cavalry. Woohoo!Enjoy! :D			"

												This is an old classic which needed to be on Steam when it first came out in 2002.It is a unique take on popular mythologies and it has many game modes .Singleplayer campaigns are interesting,multiplayer still needs some work since game lags in online play.i like this game especially i like the included god powers and updated graphics.the only minus if you can call it that way is when you zoom in you can see that graphics is still dated but that is understandable since this is an older game.Music is awesome ,graphics looks better then some of the newer games if you put all on high details.Thumbs up and play this with your friends:)			"

												First of all, I've never played AoM or AoE or anything like this before, neither any strategy game like this. A friend of mine wanted to buy it and asked me if I wanted to share the four pack. I agreed and plled two more friends in... I loved playing Dota 2, but now, even when I miss racing around the map as Bloodseeker, I'm more willing to play AoM, because I loved it. I always play with a friend of mine, one of the two I pulled in, and he had already played it long eons ago, so he taught me the basics and we play cooperatively, almost like one civilization with two players... except our civilizations are never the same.For issues about connection, I admit there are some, but issues from Dota 2 are far worse than these, and mostly, I know it isn't the game's fault, but my friend's poor connection.The only real problem is... this game is just a ilttle expensive.... just the price to eat for a month... depending on how much you eat of course.So I suggest: put it on your wishlist and wait for steam's crazy discounts. The 4-pack we shared was for a bit more than $10.00 ... divided by four people. Plus, my share of the price was given as birthday gift.			"

												This is why I don't like Steam reviews; You can't have a middling opinion. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is, at it's heart, the same good game we loved to play years ago. Pitting (mostly) real world civilizations with their own mythological flairs against each other to have a winner takes all brawl. Seeing cyclops throw men around like ragdolls or the villagers of an enemy die when you summon the cold horrors of Fimbulwinter will never get old. The problem is; The price and the DLC. I've heard MANY complaints over the multiplayer, but I don't play the multiplayer. Carrying on...The price of AoM: EE is far too much unless it's on sale. What (exactly) came into the brains of the people who fixed the price is beyond me. I can only assume someone fell asleep at the switch as this game should always be a cool $10 at most. Now onto the DLC; It reeks of mediocrity and is basically a fanmade piece, and not a particularly good fanmade one either. Look at the wonder that have been done with Wars of iberty for Age of Empires 3 to see what I mean; It's basically a small team of guys who poured themselves into research, polish, and creativity and came out with a winner. The guys who made Tales of the Dragon came up with a load of uninspired units and gardens, which are like many mini Vaults of Plenty (An end-game God power that nets you a trickle of resources; See how that can be overpowered)?The game itself is great, what they ask for it and what (new) things they've offered isn't. Don't get suckered in for full price, wait for a sale like I did.			"

												Alot of people have been having trouble launching AOM, If you click play, and you get a quick loading and then nothing happens you'll most likely need to re-install the game, and install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 or better. This should help. The game if fun. Nostalgia. A little laggy when it comes to big games but it's an old game so. "

												As far as I can tell, it feels like the original game patched to have mordern-ish graphics with a few bonuses. For those like me who have played the original and looked to this expecting something more refined, even if nothing new, you came to the wrong place! Most of the bugs in the original seem to still be around. I personally bought it to play with my friends online, but that is probably the most laughable thing there is. The application seems to use a client-side host with the steamworks intergration to connect players to eachothers servers. This alone isn't a bad thing, but the server seems so poorly optmized it feels that even the best of IPS will probably still have pretty bad lag. Simply put, steaming a YouTube video in HD is probably less taxing on your internet. Probably the worse part is the game has MEMORY LEAKS! Numerious times have myself and other players I know had there entire progress eradicated because of a memory allocation error which completely crashes the game. Rule of thumb in software development: critical bugs should not exist in finished products. Crashing to you desktop with a ""Memory System Error"" pop up is less than graceful and definitely counts as a critical bug.			"

												As a kid, this was the first game I ever played. I would spend hours at a time playing it. When I saw that it was up on Steam, I was thrilled. I immediately bought it. The community is fairly small, but is close knit, and great maps are coming from the original AoM title back onto here. If you're on the fence about this game, take my word for it and by it. There are still some issues, but those are minor and you can hop right back into the game. The campaign is one of the best I have ever played, and creating your own game type/map is one of the best things that a video game can offer. Not only that, but you can gain info about the civilization that you are playing as AND get info on units like the minotaur, cyclops, and fire giants, just name a few. And what's NOT great about destroying your enemy with a bunch of giants spewing fire and ice?			"

The majority of the people on the game are terrible. There are so many bugs now, that its not even worth playing at this stage. You will desync the majority of the games, and the games that you don't will be quick. The only way to get a good game is to find friends that are at your skill level. To be honest, I only recommend this game to those who will take the time to deal with the bugs. Hopefully, the AOM team haven't given up on us, and are working to fix these bugs, but it doesn't really seem like they are. Good luck, and if you get the game, I hope you enjoy			"

												I've played the game quite a bit, and never run in to any of the bugs everyone is talking about. I've played pre-made matches with real-life friends, matchmaking with random people, plenty of skirmishes against the AI, and the game has always held up just fine. Which is shocking, really, considering my laptop struggles to play most games, new or old. I've probably had fewer issues playing AoM than any other game. Which is just to say that the ""game-breaking"" bugs are not as widespread as some of the negative reviews may lead you to believe.It's a fun classic-style RTS with an interesting theme, plenty of faction/sub-faction variety, and the kind of easy-to-learn hard-to-master strategic-depth you'd expect out of a good strategy game. A solid 9/10.			"

												A classic of the RTS genre, Age of Mythology greatly played to my love of the Greek and Egyptian Mythologies and introduced me to the Norse. Mind you this was back when AoM was first released back in 2002. I loved it then and I loved it now.The game plays like your standard Age of Empires styled RTS game. Gather resources, build an army, topple your enemies. This game introduces a unique resource known as Favor which is generated differently across the 4 factions of the game. The Greeks require villagers to worship at the temple, Egyptians build up to 5 monuments, the Norse gain favor through battle, and the Atlantians gain favor by controling Town Centers. Favor can be spent to purchase specific god related upgrades or train myth units which can give you an edge. Each facton can, technically, be broken down into three subfactions divided up by the major god the faction uses. Greeks can worship Zeus, Hades, or Posedeon, Egyptians worship Ra, Isis, or Set, Norse worship Thor, Odin, or Loki, and the Atlantians worship Kronos, Oranos, or Gaia. Each major god carries their own unique god powers and other benefits upon their faction. For instance, following Thor grants you access to a Dwarven Gold Mine which, depending on the age in which it is used, acts as a free bonus Gold Mine for players to use. Similarly Thor allows for the construction of a Dwarven Armory which researches cheaper upgrades than average armories. Each major god also has a select list of minor gods for you to choose from when advancing from one age to the next. You can only pick one of two gods to worship and will gain the benefits from that god once you reach the next age. Each minor god grants you a special myth unit to use and each myth unit has its own unique traits. For example the Egyptian Scarab is a living siege unit designed to destroy enemy structures, the Greek Pegasus is a flying scout, etc. Each of the minor gods includes unique upgrades that can be researched that affect specific groups like cavalry, villagers, infantry, etc.The god powers for each faction also differs. The Atlantians have a slight advantage with their god powers as some of them carry multiple charges and can be used more than once after a cooldown period. Up to 4 god powers can be acquired at a time, with your initial power coming from your major god and three subsiquent powers being gained from the minor gods.In addition to basic units, there are also hero units. Hero units are the counter to myth units as they're meant for just that purpose of eliminiating the myth units. Each faction has their own hero units. Egyptians have Priests and the Pharoh, Norse have a hammer wielding melee hero, and Atlantians can promote any one of their infantry or cavalry units into heroes for a price. Greeks seem to have the short end as they only get up to 4 heroes at a time and these heroes may vary between infantry, cavalry, or archer. However the Greek Heroes have their own unique abilities such as Ajax being able to bash enemy units away with his large shield.And then there are the Titans! The Titans were introduced with the Titans expansion and AoM is probably one of the first games to introduce a game changing uber-unit. Upon reaching the mythic age, each faction can place a Titan Gate which, once it is uncovered/constructed by the faction's builder units, releases a Titan which is a massive and powerful melee unit that deals unbelievable damage and in most cases can obliterate an entire army singlehandedly. The only drawback to the Titans are that their health is finite and any health lost is lost forever and if the Titan dies, you don't get another one. The most effective counter to a Titan is another Titan or a host of ranged hero units. The Atlantians seem to have a slight advantage here as if the minor goddess Hecate is worshiped, a special bonus of hers allows all myth units to gradually regenerate their health, and Titans are concidered myth units.The only real drawback to the game is that you're fixed to only one camera angle with a top down view. This is from 2002 so that can be forgiven as a ""dated mechanic."" Your army size is limited to 200 population points max and most units take up at least two or more population points so you're not going to have armies numbering in the thousands. You'll be lucky to have an army in the dozens. Villagers also count against the population cap. Another frustration with the population cap is that population is determined by the number of houses or town centers you have. Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse can build up to 10 houses to increase their population while Atlantians can build up to 5 Manors which offer the same benefit but can also be garrisoned by other units for defense. After that, the only way to increase your unit cap is to build additional town centers and those can only be built on top of pre-existing settlements in the world and those settlements may or may not be in an optimal position. You could easily find an availible perilously close to your enemy's camp. If the map has a water feature such as a large lake or a chain of islands that isolate you from your enemy, be ready to use up half of your population to building naval defenses as ships count against the population count too. And don't bother summoning your titan from the safey of your base if you're on an island because then it becomes a glorified watchdog as Titans cannot board transports and cannot go across the water. They're landlocked so if you use up that titan gate, you're stuck with a titan at your base. Great for defense if the enemy makes it to shore (No ranged attack on the Titan, remember) but besides that...Also be very careful on where you use your titan gate power because if you demolish it by accident or it gets destroyed by your enemy, you don't get it back and its gone forever along with all chances of your getting a titan, especially if you've got one baring down on your base.Still, Age of Mythology is an RTS that should be played by every RTS fan.There is also an interesting piece of news. Age of Mythology may very well be the first game ever to recieve an expansion pack update for the first time since the last official update 13 years after the game was released. The Tale of the Dragon Expansion Pack is supposed to include an all new faction: The Chinese and include figures and deities from Chinese mythology. The expansion pack is set to be released on January 28th of this year. And just to give you some perspective, The original Age of Mythology was released in 2002 with the Titans Expansion releasing the year after in 2003. Now we're getting an expansion pack in 2016. That's almost 14 years after the game came out. For a game to be this old and recieve an update like this 14 years later is definately something worth noting.			"

												I have been playing this game since it came out in 2002 and I was just a little girl.  This is definitely a classic game and is great for all ages.  The game is a great strategy multiplayer starter.  The single player is also fun to do.  I highly recommend this game for everyone from young to old.Pros: Easy to learn with tutorial and campaign mode.  Fun multiplayer that is customizable.  Twitch ready.  Nice sound effects and music.Cons: Old graphics -- so don't expect 4kUHD when playing this game.-mahalz143sinta-			"

												Sadly, this relaunch of an old success is a complete waste of money. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is suffering with a lot of problems and neither Microsoft Studios or SkyBox Labs seems to really worry about their reputation.Considering that the multiplayer isn't working really well after more than a whole year since the release date, there's no good reasons to recommend it. It's a real let down for the old fans.For new players, i suggest a smarter deal: buy the original version of the game, even without any kind of technical support.			"

												Mmm~ if you played this years back and wanted to do so on modern systems today like I did, this doesn't disappoint.  Basically the same delectable game (and one of my favorite RTS games of all time) as it was back then, with a few bugs in transition, but largely nothing game breaking, since last I remember they fixed the Steamworks issues I had with inviting my friend.For nostalgia buyers, you're going to get exactly what you think you're getting.  My only complaint is the rather high price tag for literally the same, old game, but eh, whatever.  Perhaps some of the magic is lost from when I played this as one of my first ""actual"" computer games when I was younger, but it all still holds up, and I can now appreciate the competitive and game design side of things, even if I am too chicken to play matchmaking.For newcomers, I like to think the game has a very welcoming feel.  The art style is appropriate and iconic, the units are unique and every one of them has unique voice lines and voice effects, and the music is some of the best ambient tracks I know of.  Units respond snappily and intelligently, the interface is clean and streamlined, and I can't think of a single gripe with the resource management and building.  Er, well, the walls are sometimes a bit annoying to construct, but I rarely used those.The game also comes with a concise and bite-size encyclopedia (accessible at any given time - even in game) of all of the gods and units included in the game and their usage and role in their given society, which is actually fascinating to read and largely attributed to my modest knowledge of the mythologies today.  Overall, I have no regrets buying the same game at a probably higher price than I got it before.			"

												Generally speaking this is a good game, I was playing it since childhood. But GBP 28 is way too pricy for a updated old game. Actually it's so pricey it's hard to find a player to compete with.Competetive system is messed up. You cannot compete in ranked game with friends, you get matched with player that is way too low or way too high rank compared to yours.Would only recommend for lowered price, so there would be more players online and matchmaking system fixed.

												Age of Mythology is venerable and is showing it's age. Even with the updated graphics and newly added effects, the core gameplay is still fairly simple. Newer titles offer a richer diversity of tactics and options. AoM is interesting to play for it's original variety and to see how strategy games have developed from this stage, but other than that it unfortunately doesn't offer much more.This is not to say it's a bad game, after all comparing it to newer titles who have the developments and ideas to proceed from the mistakes of their precursors is hardly fair.AoM is still a great deal of fun to play. The newly created campaign is fairly interesting, the integration of Steamworks for easy download of new scenarios and UI updates is very welcome, as well as the sharing of old scenarios (more on this in a bit).The problem is it lags terribly at times, and rather randomly so; the loading times, particularly post-game tend to drag out which seems ridiculous considering I used to run this on an old Pentium 2, but even with quad core and graphics cards on a modern system it still lags? This is rather disappointing and something is not quite right with the graphical overhaul. The steam edition also removed all scenarios, so even some of the standard edition ones that came with the DVD edition of the game are not included, luckily Steamworks has countered this, but it's still frustrating that SkyBox Labs decided to remove previous content that should have been included in the initial install especially considering that they are still charging a fairly high price for the game.Despite the uncomfortable problems, AoM: EE still boasts longevity through multiplayer and the campaign editor for creation of new content.It is worthwhile to play for those who want a blast of nostalgia, or even those who are just curious to see how far RTS strategy titles have progressed.I recommend the following Map Packs from Steamworks to subscribe to:Map Pack  by Bobba<3 Simon4lifeMenirz's collection of Ensemble Era Map Packs  "

												First of all I should mention that I'm not reviewing the original game which remains to this day a superb game, one of my childhood's favourites. The so called 'Extended edition', however, is a mess. The new chinese cultures bring nothing new to the game, and are completely bleak compared to the original three/four. The thing that bothers me the most, however, is the port itself. The extended edition was supposed to have improved graphics, but you can hardly spot it. The only thing that tweaks in the game's engine have caused is the unbelievable lag and stuttering even on machines that can run most of the contemporary games. Honestly, for a port of a 2002 game this is unacceptable. I haven't really tried to play the game online, but since the experience in the single player mode was already so cringy, I don't really expect the game to be playable online at all - I've read some of the other reviews, and apparently that's exactly the case. Overall, I'd only suggest you to buy the game if you find it on sale and just in case you cannot possibly find the original game anywhere. As said before, the graphical 'improvements' are barely noticable and the lag they cause ruins the whole experience. The chinese cultures don't bring anything significant to the game, so the game is definetely not worth the whole price.			"

												Review for Tale of the Dragon.Would i recommend this expansion to anybody to buy? No i bloody would not. I bought it on sale and i STILL feel short-changed! The campaign is boring as hell and even if i did enjoy it i would say it is too short anyway. The expansion is buggy as hell and it has been out for a while already! Villagers getting stuck between berry bushes, villagers standing there and not delivering the resource they have gathered. Heroes not reviving, heroes reviving and then just hovering about not attacking. Units getting stuck magically on terrain like cliffs, going up there somehow (even though there was no path available) and then not being able to magically make their way back down. Graphical glitches where buildings kinda 'flicker'. The god powers are also boring as hell and i dont think i found even one that i enjoyed that much. Maybe Steam should change things so in certain circumstances one can get their money back after being completely disappointed when having completed a game or expansion. I know that sounds a bit silly and extreme but thats the way i feel about this steaming pile of nonsense.So again, would i recommend anybody buying this expansion? Heck no. Save your money and spend it on something more worthy (shouldnt be too hard to find). Go and play it for free somehow ;) Like at a mates house or something :PStay away from this expansion unless you are extremely and easily impressed.			"

												Dodgy and unncessessary recreation of the original. The online support is pathetic, with a game which was previously capable of running on a dial-up internet connection, now incapable of running on a broadband connection without intense lag which only increases with each additional player. Pathfinding is far worse, meaning that often you have to navigate units manually around obstacles. Sounds appear to either not play or be missing in some cases, leaving a massive tornado totally silent while the music merrily hums along in the background. In some places graphics have been rendered worse than how they originally appear, farms seem de-saturated and fish have a bizarre pixelation in the ocean.When playing with a group of friends against bots (the lag was intoloerable, a player on my own network was also lagging as well as myself - the player who started the game), we had the same colour green used for both a member of our team and the enemy team. This lead to a lot of confusion.To summarize, just don't buy it.			"

												This is a great game for the old school strategy games lovers and especially those that used to play the original Age of Mythology and want to relive their childhood. However there have been some issues that force me to not recommend this game.The good The game is what it calls itself. It's the classic Age of Mythology with improved visuals, which to me are a welcome change Golden gift campain. I never had the chance to play this campain, nor was I aware of it's existance, so it was a fun bonus The game supports the workshopThe bad  There has been an issue to A LOT (including me) users where the game doesn't launch at all (redownloading, verifying integrity of game cache doesn't seem to work) Multiplayer can be very laggy, making it super annoying to play with your friends You are basically paying for the old Age of Mythology with some make-up onValue for moneyAssuming you won't have an issue with running the game, it is still fairly expensive (Standing on 27.99€) for just a re-skin. If you could find it being on a 50% sale, you could consider getting it. 75-80% sale is totally worth it Final thoughts If I were you I would not buy Age of mythology: Extended Edition as long as the issue of the game not starting still exists			"

If you've never played it before, you'll love it.If I had to list one downpoint though, it would be that they didn't add the WASD keys, instead of sticking to the arrow keys, for the new Extended Edition.Otherwise, 10/10.

												The great classic that it always was. Unfortunately It often lags, crashes and generally takes a while to load. However I am confident these issues will be patched in future updates. Apart from that it is the amazing game that It always has been, now with steam workshop and fancier graphics, and it is well worth buying. This game is one of my all time favourites and is definately worth the price, at least for me.Update: Many of the stated problems have been fixed through patches			"

												This is a great game for the old school strategy games lovers and especially those that used to play the original Age of Mythology and want to relive their childhood. However there have been some issues that force me to not recommend this game.The good The game is what it calls itself. It's the classic Age of Mythology with improved visuals, which to me are a welcome change Golden gift campain. I never had the chance to play this campain, nor was I aware of it's existance, so it was a fun bonus The game supports the workshopThe bad  There has been an issue to A LOT (including me) users where the game doesn't launch at all (redownloading, verifying integrity of game cache doesn't seem to work) Multiplayer can be very laggy, making it super annoying to play with your friends You are basically paying for the old Age of Mythology with some make-up onValue for moneyAssuming you won't have an issue with running the game, it is still fairly expensive (Standing on 27.99€) for just a re-skin. If you could find it being on a 50% sale, you could consider getting it. 75-80% sale is totally worth it Final thoughts If I were you I would not buy Age of mythology: Extended Edition as long as the issue of the game not starting still exists			"

												Don't let the few minutes I've played fool you; I wish those few precious minutes of my time were actually used to play this game. Firstly the installation process was hell on earth; it took over a day to download this relatively small game.Oh praised be the sun when I finally downloaded this nostalgic masterpiece, only to find it crashes harder than the Hindenberg upon launch. I've tried many options ranging from mods to literally changing the game files to try and work this out, but to no avail.I know I'm not the only person who's experienced this, excuse my colorful vocabulary, bullsh*t. I'm glad I got this game on sale because if I spent any real amount of money on it I'd be leagues more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Why should I have to try to work out a problem for a game I bought? why are the developers monkeys who create patches that fix mundane crap nobody minded, but literally - LITERALLY - breaks the game? I'm honestly considering a refund because this is an unacceptable business model. I felt burned and cheated by this game, and honestly I can't recommend this blasphemous defacement of a once-great game.Gg ""developers"" who like to ruin games, gg.			"

												- The multiplayer is already dead. You have 4 games up in the lobby at best against mostly inexperienced players that don't stick around. The original one has gameranger with a stable community and dozens of games up all the time. - It's unstable and prone to crash. Bravo Microsoft.- The FPS will occasionally sinks even on up to date systems. The original can play at 60 FPS on any toaster created this century.- It's as if someone designed the new menu on powerpoint. There was nothing wrong with the old menu.- It has shadows. Yeeeeah. The AA is unnoticeable. The cheap water effect they tacked on top of otherwise untouched 15 year old assets is an eyesore. - It costs 25 dollars more than the original version.Seriously considering a refund.There's a good chance that you, yes you reading this, already own this game. It's under that dusty pile of old CD-Roms. No really go take a look. You don't need to buy this one if you already have it.			"

												Get the old one, if you are able to make it work on your system.Plus:+ In MP, player management was integrated in steam UI, making it probably easier to invite friendsNeutral:. HD rework makes it possile to play in higher res. However, game looks slightly weird and nothing else seems to have been improved graphicallyNegative:- MP experience constantly lagging to some degree- Game sometimes lags while scrolling despite of mediocre graphics and an up-to-date pc- No bugfixing whatsoever, game still goes out of sync from time to time like the original version- limited player base, bad connections, overall MP experience (i.e. last night, from 5 games only one ended with loss/victory, all others were decided by a player dc'ing, getting out of sync)Overall assessment: AoM EE is not worth 28€ by far. Only buy if not able to play the old version. MP experience very bad. "

												I was a huge fan of the original version of this game and I was excited for a chance to own it again and play it with my friends, even at the rather absurd price for this thing. Unfortunately, 90% of the time, it's completely unplayable. This is the worst lag I have ever experienced in a steam game, up to 15-20 seconds per in game second with little to no letting up. This experience is universal among all my friends who I got this game with, regardless of who they're playing or where they are. If you're looking at getting it, I recommend Age of Empires instead, despite the buggy and incompetent AI if you're looking to play this with anyone else. I don't recommend buying this before it's fixed, though this has been brought up so many times since it's been released, I doubt it will be.			"

												Great game, but the extended edition is broken.Stop playing this game a long time because the game was unplayable with LAN (very low frame-rate on computers that exceed system requirements).Recently decided to give it another go... maybe they patched it up... first launch game took about 5 minutes to load the main menu and another minute just to change the games resolution. After the resolution had successfully changed, the textures didn't display properly. Exited the game and gave it a restart.Locked up my computer... Not even CTRL-ALT-DELETE or alt-tab would work.Judging by my trouble with the main menu, the game is still broken. Good thing someone gifted this to me.			"

												EDIT: I literally just finished writing this review and then saw the RPS link that they're announcing a new expansion on chinese mythology. At the moment I still hold my stance on the game, But I will re-pick it up when the expansion comes out and change my review accordingly.As a long time fan of both Age of Empires and Age of Mythology, I'm going to say that unless you have an extreme attachment to Age of Mythology, go with the HD Remake of Age of Empires II for now. I'm writing this on the 2015/2016 christmas season, so maybe in the future this review will become outdated, but at the time of writing there is little support for this game compared to the other HD Remake of the same series.Firstly, Age of Empires has gotten 2 DLC packs that are both great. Expansions and improvements to a 15+ year old game. Rebalances and slight tweaks all the way to adding brand new techs to change the viability of certain kinds of play. I'm not expecting Age of Mythology to get anywhere near adding new expansions to the game as Age of Mythology is a much more advanced and complicated game with more going on, which takes quite a lot more time and materials to get it running- but the fact of the matter is that Age of Mythology EX hasn't gotten nearly any updates that mean anything since it has come out, in both gameplay aspects and technical aspects. Age of Empires II HD was extremely laggy in online and broken in multiple ways when it first came out, and so was Age of Mythology EX. The difference is that Age of Empires II HD actually fixed most of it's problems through patches, while Age of Mythology EX still chugs on some systems by managing to run worse than the original game even with lower graphical settings and online is still a buggy mess. There are apparently memory leaks within the game too, which make it slowly stutter as the game goes on, especially when the unit cap increases too.This isn't really an offensively bad port, otherwise. I can't really say I am downright angry with this upgrade to steam, actually I'm kind of glad it happened so I can at least play half of a match (before it randomly disconnects) with friends again without having to go through confusing game channels. The game is still the same as before, nothing awful has changed... If you don't like the Day/Night cycles you can turn them off as far as I remember, and the updated water gets turned back closer to what it was like in the original if you have you graphics turned down low enough (at least from my testing). Overall, I am still going to play this game and enjoy it, and if you're a huge fan of this game you will enjoy it too- but if you're just considering this or another Age of XXXX game, AoE2HD is a much, much better upgrade currently and will not eviscerate your system if you're running something mildly old.

												This is the third time I've purchased this game.AOM is my favourite in the ""age of"" series by a large amount. While an old game now I still have fun jumping on it here and there and having a few games with friends of against the AI. For people who have yet to play this game, don't be put off by the mythological theme. This is still a great game that will give you the same satisfaction that you have gotten from the other titles. The campaign is fun and quite a lengthy investment. The expansion added campaign following the original is fantastic as well. You can live without the dwarves focused one, while it has some fun ideas for maps it's short, easy and lacks any real depth . The main problem I had with these in the newest steam version was that the graphical quality seems to have been dramatically reduced. I played the old version less than six months ago on a ten year old laptop and it looked better than this version on my new $3k rig. The day and night cycle is over rated and really serves no point, if anything I found it broke the game up more and turned it off. Multiplayer is fun but expect to play against strong players. Random AI matches are the same as before but with two new game types. They can be fun but I've always been a conquest or occasionally supremacy fan. Overall it's basically the same game that it was in the past. The steam community seems to have produced a nice array of new mods to enjoy and I've had fun revisiting this game once again. If you are considering repurchasing this game, wait for a sale and pick it up cheap, it's the same game. If you are looking at this game for the first time and enjoy similar games in the ""age of"" series you should enjoy this title and get your money's worth from it but it may seem a little dated at first. 7/10 "

Sorry but we found this just boring. Now we bought it on steam with the expectation that this game got the same awesome modder that AOE2 HD got, buuuuuuuut nope.- especially the online Multiplayer: I dunno if only we have this problem, but the game laggs and got like 1-2 seconds delay if you are not the host. Its not that bad because the game is slow anyway, but i dont know, a laggy multiplayer is not worth 12 bucks.			"

												This is an old RTS game from 2002I usually refrain from buying  old games that were released before 2007 as  most have been a terrible disapointment. Even though the graphics look old, outdated and haven't been improved much at all, the game is ok to play. I find the game mostly enjoyable to play even though it is an ugly game with graphics from 2000. And with AOM  Extended Edition, doesn't seem like much  has been added or changed/improved. It says improved graphics, but it doesn't look like it, all that seems to have improved is a bit of water texture, shadow and some lighting and it's still ugly old outdated textures. I like how there is a mythological aspect to the game, it makes it more interesting for me, to choose a god and have various powers you can evoke, though rather limited, powers such as call down a bolt of lightning to instant kill a enemy. And a devastating meteor that will destroy a small area. These powers are very limited though, only being able to use once per map, so should be used wisely.I also like that there are heroes and myth units, creatures like minotaurs and hydra that become stronger and grow another head after a kill.I get bored playing too much, usually after a couple of hours, as all it is, is fighting and nothing much else. And I feel happy when I complete a campaign scenario and then feel disapointed that there's another one to complete. So I probably don't like the campaign game much as it drags on and on. The campaign takes way too long to complete, usually I like lengthy games, but not when the story involved is rather boring and the scenario missions don't differ much as every one is mostly just build your base up, build army, attack and defeat. I just want it to hurry up and be over already. The campaign should be 15 to 20 scenarios at most, not 32. I prefer to play just random maps in short bursts.And it's frustrating when you get halfway through a scenario, only to have the game crash and you try and reload a recent save but the save file is stuffed and wont load so have to start the scenario from the begining again.I liked the game over all and say it's worth getting and playing at a discounted price for $10 or less, but not for full price as it's just an old rehashed game which has outdated graphics and not many improvements. Nothing that modernises or makes it feel worthy of the so called Extended title.6/10 ok. "

												If you're looking for a RTS single player experience, this game is good for you, if you're looking for a RTS to play with anyone that isn’t on fiber internet speeds, do not buy this game. This game instead of using dedicated servers uses a peer to peer system in which if a single person is lagging (due to a moderate or slow internet connection) the entire game for everyone will lag.Overall, this is a disappointment especially since the original game worked on dial-up speeds. Therefore I would not recommend buying this game.  "

I prefer to play just random maps in short bursts.And it's frustrating when you get halfway through a scenario, only to have the game crash and you try and reload a recent save but the save file is stuffed and wont load so have to start the scenario from the begining again.I liked the game over all and say it's worth getting and playing at a discounted price for $10 or less, but not for full price as it's just an old rehashed game which has outdated graphics and not many improvements. Nothing that modernises or makes it feel worthy of the so called Extended title.6/10 ok. "

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is the enhanced version of the classic RTS game Age of Mythology (2002). It plays a lot like Age of Empires series, but with the use of god powers (spells alike), mythycal units and the controversial Titan, an extremely OP unit used to crush entire armies.Those accustomed to Age of Empires II (like me) will have to develop new strategies. Rushing and spamming units is a lot less efficient in AoM, because you can't build a lot of houses before claim new settlements (town centers) and the power of gods adds spicy situations that can turn the table in a favor of a player. Also, AoM has a lot less nations, but they're extremely different and will take you a lot of matchs to master them.The Extended Edition has graphics improvements, HD support, new online features (like the observer mode and Twitch integration) and steamworks features, like the Workshop, where you can download new maps, texture packs, etc. It comes with the Titans expansion (2003) and the extra official campaign ""Golden Gift"". To beat all campaigns it will take 20+ hours. There's a lot of map types and game modes to play in Skirmish and Multiplayer. The replay value is high enough to keep you hooked for a long, long time.IMO, some things needs to be addressed, like the mediocre pathing and some MP issues with players from different countries (if you play with someone near to you, the match will be smooth). While I enjoy this game a lot, I think it's a bit pricey for a 10+ years game with minor improvements. Thankfully, AoM: EE receives great discounts from time to time. Wait for a sale and join the community!			"

												Age of mythology is a marble of a game, unfortunately Age of Mythology EE is just plain abuse of the game I loved.The developers did not bother to put any fixes in for the existing issues the original had, if anything they added mostly un interesting features, they broke the core of the game even more extrapolating all the issues the original game had before and and added more issues to it.This game is a disgrace and the developers do not bother supporting it, they♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a marble of a game just to squeeze every last penny out of it.If its on sale and you think the singleplayer is worth the money, by all means buy it. For MP however the game is a disaster.			"

												The Tale of the Dragon is a terrible expansion to our beloved Age of Mythology's franchise! The Chinese's civilizations are unfairly balance against the other civilizations in the game. 50+ scout cavalry with low HP but high damage is an equivalent to to the Egyptian's Mercenary cavalry. Even though they have high HP, they have limited time to live unlike the Chinese's scout cavalry! And don't get me started on the vermillion birds, this things is so OP that it's just ruin the game!Even the Chinese's god powers are unfairly unbalanced, that's make the Atlantean's God Powers looks like a vanilla!But the online game is really fun, the community are tight knit and friendly! There's unlimited scenario to play with and you can hone your skills against the players around the worlds. You can even team up with them and take on Titan AIs that you find it difficult to do on single player.Over all, the expansion was terrible but thanks to Forgotten Empire for releasing this game on Steam for the fan to play and battle online as well as Ensemble Studio for being the original creator and master of the franchise. Have fun!O CANADA WUV WUV WOO PANDORAS BOX			"

												At least single player works fine for me unlike other people. I wanted to play this game back when I was a kid, but back then I didn't have good enough machine to run it and the money to buy games, so I missed on the whole nostalgia trip. Today however (ignoring the graphics) it just doesn't live up to standards. Seems like another mediocre boring game..If you are not in for multiplayer, there isn't much reason to play this, campaign is very reprtitive, every mission pretty much the same: build a base and destroy enemy. Feels like age of empires reskin. Even though with mythology they could've taken it a lot further.			"

												Age of Mythology is one of the RTS games that everyone who could use a computer in the early 2000's has played. It is an undeniable classic. All the more reason to give it a new paintjob for the next decade. Skybox has been busy bringing most of Microsoft's classic strategy names to the high definintion screen. A graphical tough up here, some upscaling there, a new netcode, steam intergration, and some more funny stuff, but when you compare it to the original version, you're going to be dissapointed. I still own the disk for Age of Mythology and it runs like a purring kitten on my laptop. This updated HD version...barely any improvement. It is still very much the same game. Basically the devs went to the game and replaced its parts with modern, more durable ones. Kinda like going into a house and replacing all the lightbulbs with LEDs and replacing the TV with flatscreen. It is superficial, and it doesn't even come close to justify its outrageous pricepoint. The game itself is still stiff, the voice acting weird and many of units that look impressive lack the punch you'd expect. What skybox has done is put new wheels and paint on a classic hot rod old it as new while the ride has gotten awful over the years and tires spin out when you try to pull away.			"

												The original AoM from ye olde disk is fantastic and one of my favorite games of all time. This port, however, is not. It claims to be an ""extended"" or ""enhanced,"" but manages to look and play worse than the original. I was incredibly excited for the expansion, but was again let down by extensive balance issues that took days or even weeks to fully fix and that a complete newcomer to the game could have diagnosed within their first match. The only redeeming features of this game are that Steam integration makes multiplayer way easier than mucking through Gameranger or Hamachi LAN emulators, and that it runs on Windows 10 (The original version with Safedisk no longer functions on my clean installation of Windows). While this game is absolutely worth playing, try to get the original version to work instead of the Steam version if possible. Although I cannot recommend this game in good conscience, I will continue to play it for the forseeable future as a (barely) functional substitute.			"

												Here we are again with another of Ensemble's games.  Ensemble, in case you're wondering, is an old PC dev that published under microsoft then went bankrupt.  This game?  I've heard good things about it.  Will I ever know if it's good or not?  No.  Why?  Well, this isn't actually the game we knew.  It's a copy-and-paste remake by Skybox Labs, but one part was changed [for the worse]-- the netcode.Its netcode is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Let me just tell you about ONE match, one that was in LAN... 17 out of sync errors, an army that recognizes orders up to 2 seconds later than you clicked, a screen that only renders enemy armies on the minimap, but doesn't show you the actual army until 5 seconds after they've supposedly come close enough to see, in which they lag-teleport forward.I don't know why I trusted these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Skybox a second time.  This is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they pulled with Age of Empires 2 ""HD Edition,"" a fake HD edition (looked just as old as classic, textures that were changed I changed back because they looked like♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a terrible netcode as well.  This time, perhaps they didn't sell off somebody's modwork as paid DLC, but it's still just as unplayable as AoE2.Do not recommend under any circumstances.  Final verdict: Go buy it on disc from Amazon for around $8, new condition.  The original game's only from 2007, so compatibility issues are only a problem on Windows 8 in which case some have fixed it and I'm sure there are directions to fixing the game for Win8.			"

												Age of Mythology is a game of heroes and monsters, mighty armies and epic deeds. Lead your culture through the ages, from humble beginnings in a small village, to mighty citadels protected by the power of the Gods. Tear down the walls of Troy, battle Giants in the frozen wastes near Midgard and fight armies of Anubites in the shifting sands of Egypt.The Gods, as a token of appreciation, may someday reward you with great Earth-changing powers in Age of MythologyEh, what more can I say? Its a very good Age of Empires game with a bit of Mythology. Singleplayer is amazing, filled with memorable story, action, characters and very unique levels. It also have hight replayability, with 4 different difficulty settings.Multiplayer is great (a bit of connection issues but its still active).The game works perfectly fine like in old days with addition of improved visuals,  modern resolution support and few balance changes. The game have also build in interesting encyclopedia about many things, both history and mythology.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition have a lot of content that will keep RTS fans for many hours.

												I don't recommand this game at full price until a patch.  I haven't tried singleplayer, but the multiplayer is really badly optimised and me and my 2 friends struggled during the entire game, trying to keep up with the verry laggy servers.  If you want to buy this, wait until you read on Reddit that the game is now good to play, because buying it now is a simple waste of money.			"

												The Tale of the Dragon is a terrible expansion to our beloved Age of Mythology's franchise! The Chinese's civilizations are unfairly balance against the other civilizations in the game. 50+ scout cavalry with low HP but high damage is an equivalent to to the Egyptian's Mercenary cavalry. Even though they have high HP, they have limited time to live unlike the Chinese's scout cavalry! And don't get me started on the vermillion birds, this things is so OP that it's just ruin the game!Even the Chinese's god powers are unfairly unbalanced, that's make the Atlantean's God Powers looks like a vanilla!But the online game is really fun, the community are tight knit and friendly! There's unlimited scenario to play with and you can hone your skills against the players around the worlds. You can even team up with them and take on Titan AIs that you find it difficult to do on single player.Over all, the expansion was terrible but thanks to Forgotten Empire for releasing this game on Steam for the fan to play and battle online as well as Ensemble Studio for being the original creator and master of the franchise. Have fun!O CANADA WUV WUV WOO PANDORAS BOX			"

												At least single player works fine for me unlike other people. I wanted to play this game back when I was a kid, but back then I didn't have good enough machine to run it and the money to buy games, so I missed on the whole nostalgia trip. Today however (ignoring the graphics) it just doesn't live up to standards. Seems like another mediocre boring game..If you are not in for multiplayer, there isn't much reason to play this, campaign is very reprtitive, every mission pretty much the same: build a base and destroy enemy. Feels like age of empires reskin. Even though with mythology they could've taken it a lot further.			"

												Remember the days of old, the age of glory for Age of Empires and The Settlers? Well, that's where Age of Mythology comes in.One has to admit that 9 out of 10 purchases of this Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is made purely for nostalgic reasons. Most buyers remember this game from the past, or from their childhood, and are glad it's got a reboot, escpecially after Microsoft completely removed the ESO (online Multiplayer) support for Age of Mythology, making the game only playable through LAN and VPNs. For those people it's more than obvious that the game's a viable purchase.Mind that Age of Mythology is highly educational. It's an RTS that uses 4 different kinds of mythological cultures as factions to fight each other. You can choose Norse, Greek, Egyptian and ""Atlantean"" gods to worship, in which the atlanteans tend to worship Greek titans rather than gods. The upgrades, units, myth creatures and buildings are extremely and surprisingly accurate to what is described in their respective mythologies, and the game even has a built-in encyclopedia full of lore behind each entity and upgrade within the game. Before actually having proper mythological history classes, Age of Mythology was my base mythological knowledge and by the dragons, it gave me a huge advantage. Age of Mythology is definitely an entertaining way to learn about ancient culture and old religions.Are you looking for something shiny and revolutionary? Look elsewhere. This game is quite old and despite the updates, it hasn't got the fancy graphics and mechanics you'd get in strategy games nowadays. Are you into retro-ish games with stable mechanics and decent online gameplay? Yes, this will work out fine.There's some issues I have with this game, though. First of all, the game is expensive, considering that the only real addition to the classic game that is truly significant is the reboot of the online game mode. The game has the same old bugs and the game's connection online is worse than it's been in the old days. But... I guess it works, which is quite an improvement. The issue is more or less that it is very much questionable whether matches of the day, online support, achievements and minor tweaks (which are mostly imported scripts that one could've just downloaded from AoM Heaven or whatever Age of Mythology fan website) such as changing of seasons and ""updated graphics"" (which are barely notable) are actually worth the money. If you're extremely interested in and devoted to the comeback of random PvP online gameplay within Age of Mythology, then yes, consider getting this. If you're up for amazing new features and fixes to the game other than ranked online modes, I do NOT recommend this, for the new features are barely notable and not worth your money.Why do I recommend this game? Because I'm rating Age of Mythology here, and not the extended edition per se. The game is not bad, the game is actually quite fantastic. It's the extended edition updates that's just not worth the effort in my opinion. In conclusion, Age of Mythology is an all-time classic and must-have for those who enjoyed Age of Empires and other relatively old RTS games. The rules of thumb for purchasing this game are:- IF you're extremely interested in random PvP online Age of Mythology gaming, buy the extended edition. Note that the connection is bad and you will experience a lot of lag.- IF you are a fan of Age of Mythology and want to support the reboot, regardless of the additions being underwhelming, buy the extended edition.- IF you're here for revolutionary RTS experiences and shiny new mechanics, move along.- IF you're not interested in history and mythology, move along.- IF you don't care about the online mode and/or find the additions not impressive, get an old copy of Age of Mythology + the Titans expansion at your game store or online. You can get these old copies for about $2 and they run perfectly fine on ANY XP or higher Windows OS without trouble, and the LAN feature will work fine, so if you want to play with some known friends you can just use a VPN client like Hamachi or Evolve.

												Dont get fooled by the positive rates, this game is nothing but a big disappointment and the same story as the remake of Age of Empires II ""HD"". Someone who rates this game positive is making a giant mistake. People actually think of the original game, which came out in the early 2000' and not the so called ""Extended Edition"" which is now available on Steam. If people were held to rate only the ""new"" EE, all the thumbs would go down. Dont get me wrong, the original AoM aswell as AoE II were briliant games which i truly admire. Publishers take an old and sucessful game, dont change anything at all and call it afterwards ""HD"" or ""Extended Edition"" to resell it for 10-30€The graphics are the same like in the original game, the resolution of 1920x1080 doesnt fit to the rest of the game.The multiplayer is a complete mess with tons of bugs, crashes, laggs, etc.. It takes forever to start a game cause you cant find other players online and if you get a game finally started, you got 50% chance that you, or anyone else drops or crashes and disc.The game is in no case worth its price of around 30,00€. My recommendation is to get this game on sales for a max. price of 5-8€ or find the original one and install it again.			"

												The original AoM from ye olde disk is fantastic and one of my favorite games of all time. This port, however, is not. It claims to be an ""extended"" or ""enhanced,"" but manages to look and play worse than the original. I was incredibly excited for the expansion, but was again let down by extensive balance issues that took days or even weeks to fully fix and that a complete newcomer to the game could have diagnosed within their first match. The only redeeming features of this game are that Steam integration makes multiplayer way easier than mucking through Gameranger or Hamachi LAN emulators, and that it runs on Windows 10 (The original version with Safedisk no longer functions on my clean installation of Windows). While this game is absolutely worth playing, try to get the original version to work instead of the Steam version if possible. Although I cannot recommend this game in good conscience, I will continue to play it for the forseeable future as a (barely) functional substitute.			"

I was extremely dissapointed that I could not play this fantastic game (since I've played the original version awhile back) and it's too bad it doesn't look like the devs for this have any plans on fixing issues like the one I had. There are numerous threads on this game's support page similar to the issue that I had and not one of them has a comment from the game developers/managers, whatever. I hope it's update in the future so that I can buy it then and play this amazing game once again. I do not recommend this version simply because I couldn't run it, but if you can get your hands on a copy that works or if this one works I know you'll enjoy this game. I got mine refunded so there's no harm in trying it out to see if it will work.			"

All of them Were all fun to play and learn about, along with the Minor Gods, and all of the Mythological Beings such as the Phoenix (Egyptians)or the Automatons (Atlantians) and of course the Minotaur (Greeks).  If You buy this Game, I hope You will learn as much about it and enjoy playing it as much I have in my past.			"

												This game can play a lot more glitchy and slow compared to the original version. It is at its worst online because of lag issues, even when both/all people have a good internet connection it can lag quite a bit. Even when playing offline to me it seems to run worse then the original when playing both side by side, and the textures can seem a bit off for some things like the fish which seemed blurry and indistinct. But I'm sure all these problems can be fixed, hopefully soon and it is still tons of fun. It allows multi-player via steam which makes playing with friends and online in general much easier, still it is a bit pricey for such an old game with its issues and understandably too much for some. I would recommend it to anyone who loved the game and/or wants to play it with friends/people online as hopefully it will only get better. "

												I have been in love with this game since childhood. RTS strategy with quite strong narrative set in Greek mythology? No way it's going to change.+ quite decent story with respect to the genre+ unique setting+ ages really well and graphics is still not that bad			"

												I used to play the original AoM when I was younger in 2007 and now that I can once again play the best strategy game of all time is awesome. With better graphics and all the DLC's which I never played before I am loving this. I have just scratched the surface getting through about half way through the original campaign and I can't get enough of it. Its just how I remember and even better. If you are looking for a strategy game and you love mythology then pick this up, but when it is on sale because it is overly expensive at the normal price. 9.5/10			"

There are many others who have the same issue as mine. Please steam fix this for the improvement of the steam community. Thanks.			"

												Remember the days of old, the age of glory for Age of Empires and The Settlers? Well, that's where Age of Mythology comes in.One has to admit that 9 out of 10 purchases of this Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is made purely for nostalgic reasons. Most buyers remember this game from the past, or from their childhood, and are glad it's got a reboot, escpecially after Microsoft completely removed the ESO (online Multiplayer) support for Age of Mythology, making the game only playable through LAN and VPNs. For those people it's more than obvious that the game's a viable purchase.Mind that Age of Mythology is highly educational. It's an RTS that uses 4 different kinds of mythological cultures as factions to fight each other. You can choose Norse, Greek, Egyptian and ""Atlantean"" gods to worship, in which the atlanteans tend to worship Greek titans rather than gods. The upgrades, units, myth creatures and buildings are extremely and surprisingly accurate to what is described in their respective mythologies, and the game even has a built-in encyclopedia full of lore behind each entity and upgrade within the game. Before actually having proper mythological history classes, Age of Mythology was my base mythological knowledge and by the dragons, it gave me a huge advantage. Age of Mythology is definitely an entertaining way to learn about ancient culture and old religions.Are you looking for something shiny and revolutionary? Look elsewhere. This game is quite old and despite the updates, it hasn't got the fancy graphics and mechanics you'd get in strategy games nowadays. Are you into retro-ish games with stable mechanics and decent online gameplay? Yes, this will work out fine.There's some issues I have with this game, though. First of all, the game is expensive, considering that the only real addition to the classic game that is truly significant is the reboot of the online game mode. The game has the same old bugs and the game's connection online is worse than it's been in the old days. But... I guess it works, which is quite an improvement. The issue is more or less that it is very much questionable whether matches of the day, online support, achievements and minor tweaks (which are mostly imported scripts that one could've just downloaded from AoM Heaven or whatever Age of Mythology fan website) such as changing of seasons and ""updated graphics"" (which are barely notable) are actually worth the money. If you're extremely interested in and devoted to the comeback of random PvP online gameplay within Age of Mythology, then yes, consider getting this. If you're up for amazing new features and fixes to the game other than ranked online modes, I do NOT recommend this, for the new features are barely notable and not worth your money.Why do I recommend this game? Because I'm rating Age of Mythology here, and not the extended edition per se. The game is not bad, the game is actually quite fantastic. It's the extended edition updates that's just not worth the effort in my opinion. In conclusion, Age of Mythology is an all-time classic and must-have for those who enjoyed Age of Empires and other relatively old RTS games. The rules of thumb for purchasing this game are:- IF you're extremely interested in random PvP online Age of Mythology gaming, buy the extended edition. Note that the connection is bad and you will experience a lot of lag.- IF you are a fan of Age of Mythology and want to support the reboot, regardless of the additions being underwhelming, buy the extended edition.- IF you're here for revolutionary RTS experiences and shiny new mechanics, move along.- IF you're not interested in history and mythology, move along.- IF you don't care about the online mode and/or find the additions not impressive, get an old copy of Age of Mythology + the Titans expansion at your game store or online. You can get these old copies for about $2 and they run perfectly fine on ANY XP or higher Windows OS without trouble, and the LAN feature will work fine, so if you want to play with some known friends you can just use a VPN client like Hamachi or Evolve.

												Dont get fooled by the positive rates, this game is nothing but a big disappointment and the same story as the remake of Age of Empires II ""HD"". Someone who rates this game positive is making a giant mistake. People actually think of the original game, which came out in the early 2000' and not the so called ""Extended Edition"" which is now available on Steam. If people were held to rate only the ""new"" EE, all the thumbs would go down. Dont get me wrong, the original AoM aswell as AoE II were briliant games which i truly admire. Publishers take an old and sucessful game, dont change anything at all and call it afterwards ""HD"" or ""Extended Edition"" to resell it for 10-30€The graphics are the same like in the original game, the resolution of 1920x1080 doesnt fit to the rest of the game.The multiplayer is a complete mess with tons of bugs, crashes, laggs, etc.. It takes forever to start a game cause you cant find other players online and if you get a game finally started, you got 50% chance that you, or anyone else drops or crashes and disc.The game is in no case worth its price of around 30,00€. My recommendation is to get this game on sales for a max. price of 5-8€ or find the original one and install it again.			"

It's all here. The game is complete, does not suffer from glitches or any sort of issues and playing online with friends is even easier now than it used to be.

All of them Were all fun to play and learn about, along with the Minor Gods, and all of the Mythological Beings such as the Phoenix (Egyptians)or the Automatons (Atlantians) and of course the Minotaur (Greeks).  If You buy this Game, I hope You will learn as much about it and enjoy playing it as much I have in my past.			"

												AoM was one of the few games that I used to play when I was kid so I decided to try it as I found it on Steam. I read some of the negative feed back, but I thought that crashing happened only if you played with multiplayer.Nope.Game crashes after few hours of playing and naturally destroys everything you have done so far. (You can save the game, but I personally like playing random map games only once.) There is really no point in wasting your money on this as it doesn't work.If this would work, it would be awesome and nostalgic game (with updated grafics and new worlds), but it doesn't so...AoM oli yksi harvoja pelejä, joita nuorempana pelasin, joten päätin nyt kokeilla sitä uudestaan, kun sen Steamista löysin. Lueskelin negatiivisempia arvosteluita, mutta oletin, että viat ja kaatuileminen on lähinnä Online-peleihin.Eipä ollut.Peli lentelee nurin ja hävittää luonnollisesti siinä ohessa kaiken tekemäsi. Pari tuntia kun on pelannut ja sitten tekee näin, niin motivaatio alkaa nopeasti tippua. Ei kannata rahojaan tähän tuhlata, vaan ennemmin muistelee niitä vanhoja hyviä aikoja.Olisi muuten ihan loistava ja nostalginen peli (pieniä päivityksiä on tehty, mutta suurimmalta osalta sama peli kuin ennenkin), mutta se toimivuus...

 Age of Make-Me-Some-Cash This game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor mess.Who would've thought that an AOM fan such as me wouldn't have minded that expensive £22.99 fee for what this game offers?Multiplayer is laggy as hell, and I've heard that players are taking a dump over the desyncs that make you LOSE ELO (ranking points). Multiplayer ranking matches are effectively a WASTE OF TIME! - 1 hour into the game and the game has already passed the salt onto a once beloved series. This game poured salt onto its self-inflicted wounds.I highly appreciate the efforts made into this game, but there's no way that over in 1 year of development that SkyBox Labs (or Forgotten Empires) can overcome an issue such as losing ranking through just disconnecting your effin' connection cable.This game deserves the epitome of horse dump. Congratulations. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!Buy the original - For multiplayer, use Voobly or Gameranger.			"

												NOSTALGIA ALERT!Alongside a other notables mentions such as Age of Empires II and Empire Earth this is literally one of the founding pillars of real-time simulated strategy games. People really need to appreciate that this game comes from 2002 and Steam deserves extra kudos for putting it up on sale. Would recommend this to anyone who likes real-time strategy as it really did set a concrete standard or them earlier on this millennium. Diverse gameplay, I dare say even Age of Empires III may of even glanced over at this at took some of it's ideas >_> One bad thing is that there is a limit on housing and forced limits on town centres so you -pretty- much never get massive battles. Minus that, and expected issues with anything this old, it's a solid game.			"

Also there are a lot of maps, some are easy and some are very tricky.

												I can't belive I almost didn't buy this because of the amount of recent negative reviews re the game not running etc. I had NO problems running the game on Win7, about 2 years old PC. I experienced NO lagging. I find this to be a good remake of the game I loved as a kid.I think the graphics remake is pretty good, the textures and shadows look nice. Of course, the 3D models would need updating too but I guess that's just a lot of work :) I am happy with the way that it is. Having played recently the original version of this game, I think the remake is really nice.I haven't encountered any single player bugs so far, maybe apart from the unit AI being a stupid from time to time. Basically path finding issues that can be solved with a little micro control.			"

												A good game.While there has been a lot of hate for the updated edition, and I partially agree with this, Age Of Mythology hasn't got any worse. Atlanteans, Egyptains, Greeks and the Norse still have 1 new unit each for each category. Surely this is something to celebrate?While the Chinese campaign and race on the hole is a flop, and most are remodles of old units, it still shows potential for the game itself, as the cretors are more likely to create another expansion that could potentially be huge for the game's development.

												Singleplayer:I love the singleplayer campaign and the random maps mode; the story starts off well and the journey through the campaign is a comfortable experience. The random maps mode is a useful and fun game mode if you just want to have fun, it also helps players to understand how the game works with God powers, units and building expansions, etc. it's something worth playing.Multiplayer:Worthless... Every game I play, players love to kill all of my units within seconds to a few minutes, even when I don't have an army prepared. I understand that it is the idea of the game, but I never get given any time to literally do anything. I would stay away from the online part if you're not the type that likes an unfair match; the online mode has no mercy for newcomers.Overall, the main game is fun and entertaining, the online sucks and it has nothing to do with how good one is, it's just an unfair game of kill everyone as soon as the game starts.

												I cannot recommend this version of the game. Currently needs a lot of fixing before I can retracked it.The amount of glitches present at current time is just staggering, not just the visual kind where a wall is half blurry half well textured either. The largest example I just experienced from the original campaign Fall of the Trident: chapter 12 on October 19th 2016 is where some of my units got suck inside my town centre. Before this units got stuck on unwalkable parts of hills as well (still only FotT). Not to mention the visual upgrade is slapdash with Erebus being so dark I thought the greys and blacks got crushed. The added Bloom didn't help either.Have yet to try out the other 2 campeigns, and I do not own the Chinese expansion, although from reading others experience I'm not missing much. Also the rebalance to units feels wrong to me.			"

I have had Age of Mythology and the Titans Expansion for many a Year, and it STILL is my favorite stratagy game from the earlier years of my life, Playing as the 12 Major Gods Zuse, Poseidon, Hades, Isis, Ra, Set, Odin, Thor, Loki, Kronos, Oranos and Gaia.  All of them Were all fun to play and learn about, along with the Minor Gods, and all of the Mythological Beings such as the Phoenix (Egyptians)or the Automatons (Atlantians) and of course the Minotaur (Greeks).  If You buy this Game, I hope You will learn as much about it and enjoy playing it as much I have in my past.			"

												AoM was one of the few games that I used to play when I was kid so I decided to try it as I found it on Steam. I read some of the negative feed back, but I thought that crashing happened only if you played with multiplayer.Nope.Game crashes after few hours of playing and naturally destroys everything you have done so far. (You can save the game, but I personally like playing random map games only once.) There is really no point in wasting your money on this as it doesn't work.If this would work, it would be awesome and nostalgic game (with updated grafics and new worlds), but it doesn't so...AoM oli yksi harvoja pelejä, joita nuorempana pelasin, joten päätin nyt kokeilla sitä uudestaan, kun sen Steamista löysin. Lueskelin negatiivisempia arvosteluita, mutta oletin, että viat ja kaatuileminen on lähinnä Online-peleihin.Eipä ollut.Peli lentelee nurin ja hävittää luonnollisesti siinä ohessa kaiken tekemäsi. Pari tuntia kun on pelannut ja sitten tekee näin, niin motivaatio alkaa nopeasti tippua. Ei kannata rahojaan tähän tuhlata, vaan ennemmin muistelee niitä vanhoja hyviä aikoja.Olisi muuten ihan loistava ja nostalginen peli (pieniä päivityksiä on tehty, mutta suurimmalta osalta sama peli kuin ennenkin), mutta se toimivuus...

 Age of Make-Me-Some-Cash This game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor mess.Who would've thought that an AOM fan such as me wouldn't have minded that expensive £22.99 fee for what this game offers?Multiplayer is laggy as hell, and I've heard that players are taking a dump over the desyncs that make you LOSE ELO (ranking points). Multiplayer ranking matches are effectively a WASTE OF TIME! - 1 hour into the game and the game has already passed the salt onto a once beloved series. This game poured salt onto its self-inflicted wounds.I highly appreciate the efforts made into this game, but there's no way that over in 1 year of development that SkyBox Labs (or Forgotten Empires) can overcome an issue such as losing ranking through just disconnecting your effin' connection cable.This game deserves the epitome of horse dump. Congratulations. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!Buy the original - For multiplayer, use Voobly or Gameranger.			"

												A lot of people have said that the multiplayer is useless and unplayable due to bugs. I admit the desync error makes most multiplayer games unplayable but private games with friends can be easily reloaded, the modding options are great, it has nearly no differences to the original game, the chinese gods (which seems to have been a let down) is only an optional payment and the single player is practically unchanged. I would suggest playing with friends who you can privately invite and host games with to stop desync from ruining all multiplayer games but exculding that I think most of the negative reveiws are a bit too harsh. Fix desync error and it will be a great game, it's not like multiplaer worked well on the old disc versions anyway.			"

												I want to recommend this game but the game is very far from what the devs have promised.The bugs that would ruin and break the game are still in extended edition, even after months of being released. The graphics look way worse and it's impossible to get more than 20 fps. I can run Metro last light on 50 fps on max graphics but can't run such an old game above 20 fps. What the screen shots show and what the game actually looks like are totally different and I don't even want to get started on the♥♥♥♥♥♥AI that still isn't tweaked at all from the original game.

												I am a long time series fan, and this game along with the original Age of Empires are two of my favorite games ever. I think that this game holds up really well in most ways (like most RTS's tend to) and is still a really enjoyable experience, even if someone were to play without nostalgia goggles. The multiplayer is very much still alive and kicking as well. I would definitely recommend this to any fan of the series or general RTS fans, or even those who want to try out the genre- this game is fairly straightforward to learn.			"

												I want to recommend this game but the game is very far from what the devs have promised.The bugs that would ruin and break the game are still in extended edition, even after months of being released. The graphics look way worse and it's impossible to get more than 20 fps. I can run Metro last light on 50 fps on max graphics but can't run such an old game above 20 fps. What the screen shots show and what the game actually looks like are totally different and I don't even want to get started on the♥♥♥♥♥♥AI that still isn't tweaked at all from the original game.

												The original AoM from ye olde disk is fantastic and one of my favorite games of all time. This port, however, is not. It claims to be an ""extended"" or ""enhanced,"" but manages to look and play worse than the original. I was incredibly excited for the expansion, but was again let down by extensive balance issues that took days or even weeks to fully fix and that a complete newcomer to the game could have diagnosed within their first match. The only redeeming features of this game are that Steam integration makes multiplayer way easier than mucking through Gameranger or Hamachi LAN emulators, and that it runs on Windows 10 (The original version with Safedisk no longer functions on my clean installation of Windows). While this game is absolutely worth playing, try to get the original version to work instead of the Steam version if possible. Although I cannot recommend this game in good conscience, I will continue to play it for the forseeable future as a (barely) functional substitute.			"

												Age of Mythology is perhaps one of my favorite games of all time and I can honestly say that the Steam version is absolutely perfect. It has the expansion pack and everything. It plays just as it did on the original disc. I can't find anything to complain about. Even online multiplayer is still functioning and working perfectly. I would absolutely recommend this game. This is one of the best old school RTS games on Steam along with Rise of Nations and Age of Empires 2 & 3. I can't praise this game enough and I am truly grateful that I can play this game without any issues or hiccups as well as having a fresh aspect in achievment which make you want to play even more and adds even more replay value to this already extraordinary game. I highly recommend, especially if you're a fan of Age of Empires II. Rise of nations is also a game that comes to mind although the mechanics are different. This game is much more like Age of Empires II.			"

												This game is incredibly broken.Even though I run it on a razer Blade (2014) it still makes my fans run at near maximum the entire time.   Almost everygame lags because other players don't have a rig fast enough to run the game even though it's from 2002 originally. the player base has also declined sharply and only a handfull of games are available at any given moment.  I'd ask for a refund if there was a chance in *heck* that they would give me one.  also,  they claim to be working on an expansion since september 2015.... doubt that will ever happen.			"

												Pretty sad bottom line for a remake. Adds nothing of value to the original. Having to pay $30 for the addition of community mods that are available for free is a disgrace. 8/10 for the game itself which is a pretty good RTS , 0/10 for the low move from MS studios. Buy the Gold Edition for less than $10 and save yourselves the trouble.About the dlc:Another low budget piece of junk from Ensemble Studio.Let me tell you why this is a low budget piece of junk. I have played so many RTS games and never have seen a game where the hardest level is unplayable to me. It is obvious the game designers have never played the Titan level because it is simply not playable. This is due to the low budget nature of this game and the developers have not enough time to test the game's balance. Normally within 5-10 minutes of the game, you are rushed with pre-built(not built within time frame of the game) large group of enemies, which is all but impossible to beat due to the short time frame. What is worse, sometimes this large group of enemy appears within about 5 minutes, in which time you have built less than 10 workers! To make things worse, the AI has infinite resources and every 5 minutes it sends you a large group of enemies, but on your side, you have finite resources which means even if you manage to beat the first few waves, you exhaust your resources within less than 30 minutes but AI has infinite resources, the waves the AI sends you are infinite. The whole thing is ill designed. Also, the games has appalling routing algorithm and units often get stuck on map. Also controlling the units are very clumsy, for example the ""attack move"" move which is the bread and butter of the RTS games does not seem to work. It either worked like normal move or gets the units stuck. From these details you can definitely tell this is a low budget rushed product. Age of Empire 3 from the same company is about the same type of low budget junk			"

Game just randomly crashes too often. Used to be a great game. I have the old CDs, they work FINE NO GAME EVER CRASH. But this steam version CRASHES EVERY SINGLE GAME. Stay away.			"

I enjoy this game as i was one of the lucky kids to get it for christmas a few years ago and get addicted too it ;) but yes it was an instant buy of 30$ which seems expensive but not to much for something you love. A few texture mods and new GUI mods and wella time to make some mods and get some retextures to fix what they stuffed up , until they update it ofcourse.11/10 would play again.P.S hopefully they can bring out some new DLC or even a seqaul... Allthough i would much prefer a cheaper 5$ expansion that just adds a new campaign.			"

												Age of Mythology is one of the RTS games that everyone who could use a computer in the early 2000's has played. It is an undeniable classic. All the more reason to give it a new paintjob for the next decade. Skybox has been busy bringing most of Microsoft's classic strategy names to the high definintion screen. A graphical tough up here, some upscaling there, a new netcode, steam intergration, and some more funny stuff, but when you compare it to the original version, you're going to be dissapointed. I still own the disk for Age of Mythology and it runs like a purring kitten on my laptop. This updated HD version...barely any improvement. It is still very much the same game. Basically the devs went to the game and replaced its parts with modern, more durable ones. Kinda like going into a house and replacing all the lightbulbs with LEDs and replacing the TV with flatscreen. It is superficial, and it doesn't even come close to justify its outrageous pricepoint. The game itself is still stiff, the voice acting weird and many of units that look impressive lack the punch you'd expect. What skybox has done is put new wheels and paint on a classic hot rod old it as new while the ride has gotten awful over the years and tires spin out when you try to pull away.			"

I recommend this game if you played it some years ago, when it was fresh and new, this will bring you nostalgia. Im loving it.			"

												One of the greatest games ever made. Captivating title from start to finish. The Extended Edition subtracts somewhat from the original value in my opinion, with the only solid additions being multiple resolutions, the Steam Workshop and ""better"" (honestly just revived) multiplayer. The Desync issues would have been a better focus for the developers but they were eager to pat themselves on the back for what they've done here already. I loved the game as a child and the gameplay hasn't really changed much, even if you include the Steam expansions to it. If you don't mind the by now outdated graphics and the engine taking a bit more of a toll on your hardware than it should for how it looks, then this game is going to rock your world.			"

												IT'S HAPPENING!?!?!?!?For many of us Age of Mythology is a game very close to our hearts. For those unfamiliar with the game, it is essentially a Real Time Strategy game, much like Age of Empires - but with heroes and mythical units too. While their are only four main factions to choose from (greek, egyptian, norse, atlanteans), each faction has numerous gods to choose from, and the diversity of not only the mythical units, but the standard human units as well, is impressive.The single player campaign is very well designed, with good level design throughout, and you will want to play it through more than once. While the Multiplayer is where the true fun lies, the single player is still worthy as a stand-alone game. Do not be afraid of trying out multiplayer though. Sure - there will be some very good people playing online, but do not be disheartened. Soon you will be (and I'm sure many of us have already experienced this) spending countless hours trying different game modes and developing new strategies to crush the heathan(s) opposing you. Also if you can get some mates together to play then all the merrier!Even though there appear to be some technical issues with the steam edition, let us just hope that they work out similar to those that were present in the Age of Empires Steam edition (which have since been fixed).If you have not experienced Age of Mythology, then I would whole-heartedly recommend it. If you have already played it then you may be a bit sceptical about handing out money for something you already own. What you are really paying for is the steam support for multiplayer. Finding games to play will be much simpler, because I can assure you that there will be a lot of people playing this game. A great game with an active and passionate community should not be simply passed by.9/10 would nostalgia again.			"

												Gameplay is virtually unchanged since its original release in 2002, leaving the balance (or unbalance) of the game intact. Because of this, and since the original game still runs on modern computers in HD resolutions, I'll be focusing entirely on what this installment brings to the table. 1. Improved visuals: But not really.Much like the AoE2 re-release, Mythology was given a visual overhaul by the new studio. What this means is that they've tacked on new graphical features, without much considering of how this will benefit players. You'll see things such as GLOBAL LIGHTING and BLURRY WATER FILTER. Whether these really improve anything lies mostly in the eyes of the beholder; but for those who played the original, the new look will be discomforting and sometimes hindering (on certain maps, your units will be difficult to see).2. Social gaming: A.k.a. the ""Steam Experience"".Because custom maps is half the fun, right? Again, highly subjective, but unlike the visual improvements, this is actually a feature that is only beneficial, and does not hinder anyone who's not interested in it. So, in that sense, this is the best thing to come out of the Extended Edition. However, it does not - and will not ever - weigh heavily enough to be worthy of the 30€ price tag. But what about all the other awesome Steam-exlusive features that you won't find in the original 2002 release? Because a PC game without achievements and trading cards doesn't belong in 2014 - said no one ever, probably. You were fine without achievements in 2002, and you were fine without Steam trading cards in 2012. But the cloud saves! The clooooouuud saaaves! Oh god, yes! Finally I can sync my save files to the web, for instant access. No, it's a decent feature, but like the workshop, hardly a worthy selling point. 3. Extended Features: Watch other people play.Just as Age 2 HD was given Twitch Integration, Mythology was as well. This is a rising trend in video games, and I can't see anything wrong with it. Is it a necessary feature for the re-release of a 12 year old game? Probably not; but it doesn't hurt. But - and this seems to be the theme of this review - it is hardly worth the 30€ price tag. Streaming to Twitch is free with software like OBS, and also provides tenfolds more options than any integrated feature ever will. In conclusion: Don't waste your moneyUnlike the Age 2 re-release, this one is not needed - unless maybe you're among the relatively few hardcore Mythology players, that has also grown tired using 3rd party applications for online matchmaking, enough so that you are willing to throw 30€ at the unstoppable Remake-All-The-Games machine. If not, then pass on this one. It's an older game that still works fine on modern machines, and supports larger resolutions out of the box. Pick it up at a local game shop for a couple of bucks instead. You'll be better off.			"

												Not bad, bu had to say i expected a little more. The repackage on this is priceless. ""EXTENDED EDITION"" isn't really tuned up to anything special. It seems like they literally just put in the maps for the next expansion (The all too common, ""upgrade to play this!"") as a carrot on a stick for Dragon.  Oh, and NIGHT AND DAY GUYS. haha.You still have some pretty herp a derp AI and building kinks that are true to the original.  My units still love going around my city, when i have perfectly good gates X D If this is a game you miss having on your shelf,  you enjoy the mechanics of the Age of Empires games, and or have a hard on for good mythology... Buy it if it's on sale. have to say it's worth the 7 dollars i payed.If you havent played these games yet and this one caught your eye, keep a few things in mind. The campaign really isn't anything spectacular, and it lacks the depth that many other RTS have that are available for a competitive price. There's no real negotiating trades or territories or treaties. Diplomacy is clicking to go to war.Nation-building is insanely straightforward. Laborers gather each supply, and theres very few to keep track of. Food, gold, wood, favor, population. You dont have to keep them happy or worry about maintaining them (save from your enemies wrathful armies)Combat isn't anything flashy, little units slash at eachother. There are a few little tactical things you can make them do but nothing compared to some of the other RTS games you might have played. Tl;drFun and simple RTS for all skill groups, great mythology and skirmish play. Campaign lacks luster and the ""Extended Edition"" just feels like Titans with added teasers for the Dragon Expansion. Worth a couple bucks if it's on sale(I got mine for seven dollars and that seems like a fair price).BoogaBooga. "

If you are looking to play AOM muliplayer with some freinds, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is impossible to play online due to incredible lag issues that really should be fixed by now. "

												IT'S HAPPENING!?!?!?!?For many of us Age of Mythology is a game very close to our hearts. For those unfamiliar with the game, it is essentially a Real Time Strategy game, much like Age of Empires - but with heroes and mythical units too. While their are only four main factions to choose from (greek, egyptian, norse, atlanteans), each faction has numerous gods to choose from, and the diversity of not only the mythical units, but the standard human units as well, is impressive.The single player campaign is very well designed, with good level design throughout, and you will want to play it through more than once. While the Multiplayer is where the true fun lies, the single player is still worthy as a stand-alone game. Do not be afraid of trying out multiplayer though. Sure - there will be some very good people playing online, but do not be disheartened. Soon you will be (and I'm sure many of us have already experienced this) spending countless hours trying different game modes and developing new strategies to crush the heathan(s) opposing you. Also if you can get some mates together to play then all the merrier!Even though there appear to be some technical issues with the steam edition, let us just hope that they work out similar to those that were present in the Age of Empires Steam edition (which have since been fixed).If you have not experienced Age of Mythology, then I would whole-heartedly recommend it. If you have already played it then you may be a bit sceptical about handing out money for something you already own. What you are really paying for is the steam support for multiplayer. Finding games to play will be much simpler, because I can assure you that there will be a lot of people playing this game. A great game with an active and passionate community should not be simply passed by.9/10 would nostalgia again.			"

												One of the greatest games ever made. Captivating title from start to finish. The Extended Edition subtracts somewhat from the original value in my opinion, with the only solid additions being multiple resolutions, the Steam Workshop and ""better"" (honestly just revived) multiplayer. The Desync issues would have been a better focus for the developers but they were eager to pat themselves on the back for what they've done here already. I loved the game as a child and the gameplay hasn't really changed much, even if you include the Steam expansions to it. If you don't mind the by now outdated graphics and the engine taking a bit more of a toll on your hardware than it should for how it looks, then this game is going to rock your world.			"

												As a player who was enjoying this game since the early 2000's I was extremely excited to see its revival coming on steam. Though I still have the disks from back in the day, I was still excited to see the improvements on this game. After playing it for a little while I noticed multiple problems however. The game has some bugs and frame drop issues that were not in the previous disk versions. Though I absolutely love this game, I am not sure if the $30 price tag is worth it for essentially the same game you could have gotten in 2003. For all Veteran AoM players, this being brought back is amazing, regardless of the limited changes. I would still suggest it to any new players also, though, it is extremely fun and dynamic. This game pretty much was my childhood so I am a bit biased, though I believe this is arguably the best RTS I have ever played. 9.5/10			"

												Age of Mythology is a very good RTS at its core. for new players. often good amount of stratergy is required to win. you wont do so well if you just spam 1 unit to win. each of races and gods feel differnt enough to paly. all of support differnt units, upgrades and god powers to wield each game.each of the game modes also feel differnt enough to play. the editor is thought of and quite easy to use to create simple scnerios. this allows for many maps and campagns to litter the workshop many of which are quite good. however if you want to create my complex maps with edited units and even cutscenes there is no totorial  so you may need to look i up online. the campaign for aom is pretty good. i wont lie the sotry is know masterpiece however the missions themselves are quite fun. each of them fel very differnt and have unique objectives rather then just build large army and storm the enemany base. the is a large variety of maps to play on even includes a random map generatoer which randomly creates a map for u to play on however these feel too similar after a time.for returning aom players there is really nothing new for you. the only things changed is improved graphics, a day night cycle which can be annoying and golden gift campaign if you didn't have already. you an look forward to owning the new expansion though. as well as the includ of achievesments. while i like achievements in games and are a bit of acheivement hunter at times ifelt these acheivements were lame. the were flat out uninteresting. with no unique or funny names and basic goals that were just time consuming. you only have to winas and beat each god 10 times complete all campigns (theres 4) do some multiplayer  kill and lose some stuff and play and win game modes. pretty lamethe ai is ok but can be bad. on easy they spam caravens and always buy to the same units and never attack unless in water or a wonder has been built. medium is a huge change frim easy however i didn't find too much of difference between difficulties from there. they often uy very few myth units as well never seeming to have more then 4 in their armies at once.multiplayer is also ok. is very differnt expirence from the ai as most humans players are alot harder to beat as they should be. however lag and frame drops plauge this so their a few people playing online.i sometimes get frame rate drops during attacks in single player as well which can be annyoing.the cheat codes and credets are rather amusing in this game. i never watch or use either of them however after hearing things about them i sued them and found quite funnny. for the credits its only on the orginal ones and you have to get to the end of them before the humour kicks into sum AOM is a great game. one of the better rts out their.  you have never owned or played aom then this is a good game to buy. if you already own and play aom then im not really sure that this is worth the price. you would be playing 30 % for next to no new imporvements however you wopuld get access to tales of the dragon should that be free. its porbably better to wait for salesEdit with the new Dlc being released this game became ver dissapointing. the game prompts you to buy the DLC very often even breaking entire matchs with messages and units. upon buying the dlc i liked the new civilisation and maps how ever the campagn and story was quite lame. also this DLC was very prone to bugs and crashes with some making the new civilsation as i have or even the whole game unplayableEdit 2 i fixed thebug that caused the chinese civilastion to be unplayable however i had to delete all the mods as many conflicted with it. this deletes the prupose of the workshop sadly			"

They are coming out with new material and the game crashes ever other game.  I love this game and will gladly change this to a yes once they fix this.  However, the game litterally crashes or ""dysynics"" everyother game.  This happens to everybody so nobody try and say its just me play 10 games and then tell me it does not.  The developers have ruined a classic game and I am deeply saddened that they were the ones who were given the rights to this.  This is my favorite PC game and I hate to give it a no rating.

It's like seeing your bike being crushed by your nextdoor neighbor only then for him to say ""I improved it."" This game was my childhood and it's now ruined. The new graphics will hurt your eyes, and the new HUD is like it was drawn on MS Paint. Whatever you do, do not BUY this game. If you want to play the original game, then go on eBay and then search ""Age of Mythology - PC."" After that just buy the game and wait for it to arrive in the mail. This is what happens when greedy game companies put their hands on good games, and then ruin them so the player's heart is broken and so they can gain a quick buck.Original game: 7.9/10So-called ""Extended Edition"": 2/10			"

												To be clear before anything else - Age of Mythology is one of my favourite games of all time.This HD remake is not. It runs horrible. It is hardly HD, you  able to up the resolution from the original a couple steps, that is about it. There is a noticeable lag to the enitre game even when playing solo on, even on my high-end pc.The online on a fiber-optic connection is actually worse than the original game was on a 56k modem.Do not buy this game. Especially at 30.00 dollars. The original was great. This game is not.			"

I have had this game, now for approx 5 days so, have decided to delete the bugger (after numerous re-installations, blah, blah, blah) from my PC and try and get a refund.  So, I cannot recommed this game nor, at the moment, will I recommend Steam or Skylabs because it's seems impossible to get any contact with either organisation!  Really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of!			"

												Mytologickými prvkami obohatené Age of Empires klasického strihu. Ensemble Studios zbytočne moc neexperimentovali a vsadili na osvedčené postupy ich predchádzajúcich hier. To sa im samozrejme pri Age of Mythology náramne vyplatilo a dali tak za vznik ďalšej strategickej legendy. Grécka mytológia prekvapivo nijak nenarúšala pôvodne realistickejší prednes AoE, ale naopak išlo o prijemne osvieženie nie len z portfólia Ensemble Studios, ale aj žánru RTS, ako takého. Opäť tak zafungovali osvedčené postupy klasických stratégii s malými kozmetickými zmenami a samozrejme nádhernou grafikou. Za najväčšiu zmenu oproti predchodcom sa da považovať nutnosť starostlivosti o hrdinne jednotky, ktoré boli logicky silnejšie a dôležitejšie, ako bežný pešiak. Tiež by sme tam mohli zaradiť produkciu už spomínaných mytologických postáv obohatené o špeciálne schopnosti a ďaleko vyššiu účinnosť v boji, ako u bežných jednotiek. Navyše pôsobilo hrozne efektne vyslať na protivníka mensie stádo minotaurov, či párik trojhlavých hydier a sledovať vlastne nástroje skázy lačniace po nepriateľovej prehre. Vďaka tomuto remaku som si mohol do starovekého Grécka opäť na chvíľu odskočiť a opäť sa na desiatky hodín zabaviť. Obsah všetkých oficiálne a dokonca aj niektorých lepších neoficiálne vydaných rozšírení sú tu samozrejmosťou.Už pri prvom oznámení bolo z polovice jasné, že aj nasledujúci počin od Microsoftackého štúdia sa zápiše do herných dejín, ako jedna z najlepších realtimoviek vôbec a ja som za ""vek mytológie"" nesmierne rád...

It's like seeing your bike being crushed by your nextdoor neighbor only then for him to say ""I improved it."" This game was my childhood and it's now ruined. The new graphics will hurt your eyes, and the new HUD is like it was drawn on MS Paint. Whatever you do, do not BUY this game. If you want to play the original game, then go on eBay and then search ""Age of Mythology - PC."" After that just buy the game and wait for it to arrive in the mail. This is what happens when greedy game companies put their hands on good games, and then ruin them so the player's heart is broken and so they can gain a quick buck.Original game: 7.9/10So-called ""Extended Edition"": 2/10			"

												This game is the best game ever created. I have been playing it since it was first released in 2002. When Microsoft decided to ""remaster"" the game I knew I needed to have it. Do not pay full price! A game that is almost 14 years old is not worth $30. I can't tell the difference between the old visuals and the new visuals they are promising. However it doesn't matter the game is absolutely amazing and is highly recommended for ANY RTS lover. There is a lot of replay value and the story is well written with its own special moments. If your a fan of Mythology, this game really is for you!			"

												I am loving this game. I actually bought it for my son who is well into mythological monsters at the moment but I am enjoying playing this myself. I played the original Age of Empires years ago and was not overly impressed after a while by the repetitive units they drip feed against you. But this game has loads of great elements in it and played on easy with one enemy I am finding it suits my liking for slower gameplay rather than hectic battles. The graphics look a little blurred and it doesnt support my 2080x1024 res properly so I suspect the screen is a little stretched to fit my monitor but I will mess around with my Nvidea AA settings in the control panel to try to get it a bit sharper. I havent played the campaign yet but that was never the strong point of these games, but perhaps for this game is would be worth a go. Either way certainly recommend you buy this (at a sale price - I got it for £5) as its a great little game and still doesnt look bad with its slightly modernised graphics.			"

												I'm sure every long-time AoM fan wants and/or already has this game, but those who are considering buying this game: DON'T. Those top two reviews on the game's store page are from beta testers. Fun fact: Some beta testers are paid by the game devs to say good things about their game no matter how much of a crapstain it is. By now you're probably wondering when I'm gonna get to the specs. Well, I'm doing that now.God portraits are even WORSE than the original, and so are the graphics. THE GRAPHICS! It's common sense that when a 12-year-old game is given a new HD rerelease, it's in HD. This isn't one of those rereleases.It takes an incredibly high-end computer to run this game; Most laptops suffer either hard crashes or unplayably low FPS (less than 10 FPS). The FPS is even worse on multiplayer. Most of the time people lag out and your game's over. You can buy the Gold Edition of the original AoM (AoM + Titans expansion) on Amazon  for less than a third of the Steam price [i.imgur.com]. If you're asking ""But what about m-muh Golden Gift?"" Golden Gift is a 4-level ""mini-expansion""  available for FREE on the Microsoft website [www.microsoft.com]Basically, Microsoft's ripping you off right now. DON'T buy this game.			"

												A very fun blast from the past. I loved this game a lot when I was younger and it's still enjoyable, however, I'm confused as to why there seem to be so many bugs when the origonal game never had these in my experience. They've patched quite a few out, but there are still a few graphical glitches here and there.One of the main reasons I loved this game is that you get to learn so much from the various unit informations...however you also have to make sure to fix the file so that the proper information can appear when you actually load it up.Here's the fix:

It isn't exactly correct for me to say I didn't enjoy playing it this time around, because that would imply that it was playable. I loaded the game after install, and about 90% of the units were invisible. Some of them could be selected by clicking and dragging, but the vast majority were just there, able to be heard but not seen. I uninstalled it, reinstalled it, read all 50+ pages of the bug forum, nothing. If it worked, I'm sure it would be fabulous. As it is, I can't recommend it.			"

Got heavy crazy lags and there are no way to fix it by changing the options.In single player mod the game works just fine, but it´s nothing better with it then with the old AoM games. Actually they worked better in every way. And the new graphics dosen't make the game look better either, it´s worse than the old graphics. A complete failure.Fix the online features, so you can play. That's the whole reason people bought the game.  I had the old game and could have played the single player without buying this remake.DON'T BUY IT, you will just be disapointed!			"

												Used to be an amazing game, back when it came out. Then they took this old, but amazing game and replaced the water and put it on steam for like 40€. I liked the old water better. It fit the game and wasnt buggy as hell. Now, the game wont even start properly. Theres no background, like there used to be. There used to be a scenario in the background, but now it doesnt load. The map editor needs a lot of improvements as well. No way near the qualities of the Warcraft 3 map editor. There is a ton of bugs and glitches and the performance is bad. They broke the saving system, now its working again. There is also still a bug present that allows you to build a Wonder in one of the campaign missions, even though youre not supposed to be able to do that. From what I have read, the ""dev team"" behind this ""update"" is just a bunch of modders that asked Microsoft for permission to work on the game. Could have just put it on steam for like 15€ in the original form with bugfixes and support. Instead, they are ruining one of my favourite games and Im paying money for it...			"

												My problem with the game is that it refers to certain Nordic people as ""dwarfs"" while the politically correct term would be ""little people"" or ""Swedish mining enthusiasist midgets"" Please join the cause and send emails to microsoft to fight the so called ""vertically superior"" and end their evil reign of tyranny. Great online play though.9/10			"

												Remember how AoEII HD had a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of problems at launch? Me too! And that's exactly why you should wait a bit(or in the case of AoEII HD, two to three months) until they get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.AoM at its core is a fantastic game. Featuring stunning music, a unique artstyle, campaigns that are long and don't get old, unique and fun factions. The problem with the extended edition, is that it hardly adds any content. Which should be expected if you were aware of AoEII HD. This extended edition just adds some neat effects like a night and day cycle, ehanced lighting, and other graphical effects while including the base game, some downloadable content, and the expansion. Yet this extended edition feels lazy. AoEII HD was, you know, HD. It had updated sprites and all for the game. Giving it a clean look with a HUD that doesn't take up 25% of your screen. AoM EE doesn't even feature improved graphics. All the models are exactly the same from the base game, they look good as long as you don't zoom in; if you zoom in even slightly, your eyes get overloaded by pixels. One of AoM's main problems is the lack of maps or truly randomized maps. The maps are fun in themselves, yet frequently give a feel of ""you've played one, you played them all"". The developers could of easily added in a few maps, yet didn't.When AoM the Titans came around, one of the biggest problems is that you couldn't turn off Titans. Each faction gets a titan, which if you reach that far into the game, completely destroys all forms of logic and tactics. The Titan is, as the name suggests, OP as♥♥♥♥♥♥ When you get a good game going, it'll eventually become a Titan rush. Limiting truly interesting and long games. AoM EE still doesn't fix this issue since the Titan expansion pack is automatically apart of the package.I don't know what the hell they did with the options. Half the graphics options feel completely useless. The game has some bad jaggies, and turning on FXAA does nothing.Just like AoEII HD, multiplayer is completely ♥♥♥♥ed until we get some patches along the line. Everyone lags like hell, the host will be the only one doing anything resembling playing a game. Multiplayer is completely unplayable.But hey, who cares about the multiplayer right? AoM has one of the best campaigns in an RTS. Don't worry though, the patch they brought up on today, completely screwed up the game for many. The game now freezes every three seconds, making the game unplayable for both by yourself and with your friends.On release, the game had some issues. Random FPS drops, turning on FXAA makes everything look like mud and the water became horribly pixelly. But is was completely playable and enjoyable, now with this new patch, the game has become unplayable for quite a lot of people including myself.The game has some stupid launcher that is directly linked to showing AoM tweets. When a game is available on Steam, and steam only, developed entirely for steamworks; a game shouldn't have a stupid launcher like this.There's also this strange new art that they keep shoving in your face. Not the original art from the original team, this brand new art that looks bad and completely pales in comparsion.They removed the awesome intro videos of the original game instead just shoving developer splash screens. Main menu is stuck on the Titans theme instead of cycling between the original AoM theme and the Titans theme.tl;dr AoM EE at its core is a fantastic game. I myself bought the game just because I love AoM. I half expected the multiplayer to be ♥♥♥♥ed, I didn't mind. I didn't expect the entire game to be ♥♥♥♥ed because of some horrible patch choices. Wait until the summer sale, check up to see if the game has been fixed.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!As it is, this game is literally unplayable. Steam will say the game is starting, but then it will immediately stop. This means you CAN'T play the game at all or even try to. To make matters worse, the developers have done NOTHING to fix it. IF they fixed it, I would give this game a glowing review, but as it is now, it's not a game. It's a waste of memory and a useless icon on my desktop.			"

												I bought this game several months back via Steam. The connectivity was absolutely superb for what few games actually existed or that I could play with friends. Since I recently started playing again after a long hiatus, the connection since the Chinese were released has gone downhill so hard. I started playing Age of Mythology way back in the early 2000s, and it consumed much of my time after school. The game is virtually unplayable given the horrid latency online, as the storyline, although entertaining and enjoyable, has absolutely no replayability. 'Tis a shame.I'd recommend it for the fact only that it -was- a good game. I wouldn't recommend it beyond past experiences. Current experiences make it pitiful. If only Ensemble still owned it, or rather if only Ensemble still existed.			"

												Good old fashion strategy game with a sprinkle of fantasy.As all games in the age of series, the campain is really easy if you played any strategy game but still fun. 4 different factions (vikings, egyptians, greek and atlanteans) each with different perks. For instance, with my favorite faction, the norse break from the standard rts as the basic fighters for the norse are also the one building the structures.The great feature of this game is to select the faction then in game pick the gods from your pantheon you want to follow, each on having different traits. This way you can select which gameplay to follow by selecting an upgrade path every ages (or level  1-4) that will give you specific troops and powers. AI games are good to try the combinations and will keep you playing for many hours. The multiplayer is definitely the added value there.			"

												Ah, Age of Mythology. A wonderful game I have many fun memories with. Playing with friends in person before the Multiplayer was added, just bombing nations with Bawk Bawk Boom chickens was pleasant, but, however, the exploits never define the game. The game itself is wonderful, tending to be more difficult than AOE 2 or 3, but also giving you the immense power of the gods. You can summon Titans to destroy bases, throw earthquakes and meteors, build massive armies of monsters, lead by Heroes to defend them. The enormity of the game is insane, and allows for tons of fun. Highly reccomended for anyone who likes RTS' or Aoe in particular. 9/10			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!This game, no matter what others may think, yes it is an improvement to the graphics, but all your buying ladies and gentlemen is Age of Mythology Single Player, the entire multiplayer community has been halved and many people having multiple issues with the game itself which includes FPS, PING and CRASHES. The developers have now had their fair share of time to fix these issues which should of never occurred in the first place as this is just a graphical adapation with a few mods thrown in. If you don't take my word for it please read this post https://steamcommunity.com/app/266840/discussions/2/35219681828329494/#p5 this will highlight the issues currently plaguing the game and I thoroughly urge the developers to sort your game out, YOU ARE ROBBING PEOPLE OF THEIR MONEY...Additionally if these issues are not fixed soon I recommend Steam take immediate action and throw this game off your library, these developers are conning the Steam community with an unfinished, undeveloped game without declaring any sort of early-access state.If you really want to play Age of Mythology, I recommend you grab an original copy of the game, download a network client such as Voobly or Gameranger and play the game free of issues and halving your costs without the additionally anger being thrown on top.

												This game was a nostalgia overload. I had first played it when I was 6/7 years old, an I remember being absolutely terrible at it but having so much fun with the visuals and the rich mythological aspect to the game. Now the extended edition became the remake we were all looking for, unlike Star Wars Battlefront to name an example. They updated the graphics, through in a free expansion, and reinvigorated the online community. This is one of my all time favourite games, and I would heavily reccomend that you purchase it.			"

												You Shouldn't Take any advice from those 'Not Recommended' Review's. I have had this game for a very long time, eventually i got it on steam just to make sure i could get the patches and workshop content. Most people are complaining about bugs here and there without looking up the patches, When the first dlc released i had a huge patch for my basegame, and i only just realized now that, that patch was actually all the content for the new dlc, just restricted untill purchased, so my game has been running completely fine without the dlc, and now that i bought the dlc it's still running perfectly. Pro's : Great game 9/10           Run's smoothly           Easy to learn           Fantastic Storyline           Well working A.I           Heap's of Map's           DLC $9.99 Con's : Not as popular as it should be            Rarely Allied A.I is uselessNote about the dlc, it's very similar to the chinese faction in age of empires 3 asian dynasties.

												I used to play Age Of Mythology for hours when I was a child, Ever since I watched my dad playing it against some friends at a lan party I wanted to play too. To my suprize It was re textured and was available on steam! Instantly I tapped into my savings account and purchised x4 combo for the game so me and my friends to play. After afew hours of us learning to play the game by playing singleplayer we thought we were ready for afew games of free for all. Everything was going great in the pre game lobby there was no lag and we had no issues until we got into the game. Instantly we all realize that the servers are not up to hosting any of us. Great game but It really REALLY needs to have its multiplayer servers updated so that its not jurking you left and right when you are just trying to select your first 2 people.All I ask for is some love for the multiplayer and I will play for hours like I did as a child. Thanks for reading and give us a like if you feel the same.			"

												I love this game without a doubt, Its a great game but I've had nothing but problems with the game just shortly after the game launched and nothing has fixed anything on my end.Forgive my detail, But to sum it up at launch this game worked flawlessly on my rig as it should. Then now and it s been like this for awhile so it discourages me to play A LOT but it just runs like garbage now. It has a framerate of 50-60fps in the main menu alone and it jumps sparadically which it never did after launch and now my Custom games and even campaign where I played levels without a hitch and watched cutscenes with no problem and now it just lags everywhere and its just random as it will run differently the next time i launch the game, but still run like crap. So I have given up and I cant refund it now obviously or even when it started doing this. "

												I wounld't recommend this game, at least at it's current state. Now, I am one of the fortunate people that didn't encounter any problems launching or playing the game. There are multiple issues I have with this game.   The first issue isn't really game breaking, its just notable FPS drops in multiplayer. While internet connections between players no doubt is an important factor in this, but like many others who are experiencing it (Development team admitted this is an issue with coding in the patch notes), its not only the internet connections that is casuing the issue, like I said, its not game breaking.     The second problem certianly is game breaking for me, it's the poor or almost non-existent ""Attack Move"" button in this game. I have played many other RTS games, I have never seen such a badly implemented ""Attack Move"" function in an RTS game. It happened to me and my friend multiple times, if you use the ""Attack Move"" function, the units would often ignore all the enemy/hostile units in the way, the units would not attack untill they reach the location or being stopped in the pathway. That is not how an ""Attack Move"" function should work. I believe this is also to do with the poor pathfinding in this game. Units would often get stuck between various objects in the map (Trees, mines, buildings, etc.).  The third problem, while this is a minor one, but it is still noticable and affect the gaming experience. There are certain areas on the maps that you cannot build buildings on, again,  it's another bug, it gets rather frustrating when you are trying to build a wall, but the game won't allow you.  To have more of an idea the number of issues this game current has, please check out AoM:EE Issues for the Competitive Community by DragonQ. It has highlighted many other issues I didn't address in this review. I don't think this game deserves the 30 dollar price tag at its current state. I welcome these ""HD Editions"" or ""Extended Editions"" of classic RTS games, only if it is done properly.			"

												I have a gtx 760, 8gb ram, i7 4770 and a 15mb internet connection, and I lag like crazy I thought it might of been someone I was playing with online was lagging and it stutterd all of us, not uncommon, but playing LAN with my bro with his similar rig we lagged 4-5 seconds not even doing much I'm just trying to herd some sheep to my village in classical age so you know i havent gotten much built yet and I lag. Tested the cables by playing other lan games and no lag what so ever. It is an unimmersive experience when you look at you're buddies playing with and shaking your head cause the lag makes it unplayableHonestly I don't feel valued as a customer I was stoked into buying a hd remake of aom, but was duped 60 bucks [bought  two copies ] in what feel like a beta release. Even on a pc that runs battlefield 4 max settings and recording with no lag i cant see why I would on a game that even with its polished hd look is still a subpar RTS game in terms of graphics. Please stay away from this game until it gets updates addressing the lag			"

												Good Old Age of Mythology.. I always loved it. But this Extended Edition has less features than the old game. You can not do 2:2 Quick Search ! Such Basic feature of ESO missing. No ranked 2:2 3:3 as known from ESO.You have to open a game and wait for players, often resulting in uneven boring matches. Instead its possible to open a ranked 2:2 game, wait for opponents, kick them if you think they are too good and its also possible to set your favorite map. What kind of ranking is that where you select who you play against and on which map?If you are in it for the multiplayer then I would wait till they include the missing features.			"

												Feels similar to Age of Empires 2, but uses God Powers to dramatically shift battles (or occassionaly economies). As far as myth units go, you'll usually just use one or two for your civ and the rest aren't worth the effort. In ""Titans"" expansion, you're just building up to the first Titan (1 per player) in skirmish mode, but in the Campaigns they are set peices. Still, it's nice to get a new civ out of the expansion, even if it's somewhat overpowered at times.Otherwise, largely just knowing the strengths of your civilization and what your God choice (1 major, 3 minor) emphasizes will carry the day.Like AoE2, great single player and skirmish value, but (virtually) no multiplayer. Like AoE2, I am happy that this game is getting both an HD re-release and new content (I believe it's Chinese mythology for AoM, but don't quote me). Still go back when I get the Nostagia flowing in me. "

												My favorite out of the ""Age of"" Series, Mythology is one of the best RTS games I've ever played. It has a fantastic story that blends the great epics from Greek, Egyptian and Norse culture. Each of the three playable races has a drastically different playstyle, a big departure from the comparitively minor changes between different factions in previous ""Age of"" games. If you ever enjoyed Age of Empires 1 or 2, you'll probably enjoy Mythology too.			"

												I'm here to tell you that 90% of the negative reviews are because of the Multiplayer and personally, I don't give a hoot about multiplayer in my RTS so I ignore everything that has to do with it. All these people are, in their own words, 'long time age of mythology fan' and they all say you should just buy the original instead. As someone who's played both games then and now, I 100% disagree.WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS EXTENDED EDITION INSTEAD OF THE OLD ONE- The old version DOES NOT WORK on modern PC""s. And if you do get it to work, expect it to work poorly.- Fans of the original might love their old graphics, but they simply don't look good in this day and age. People who say the HD remake is no huge difference are terrible liars as the screenshots already show the difference, and the sole reason of being able to play this widesceen properly already makes it superior. And that's not even counting the improvements in animation! (Water looks fantastic)- If you really want to go multiplayer, good luck because the old game has no casual or new players, just riddled with pro veterans who do nothing but the same tactics over and over again. ""GG NO RE"" It's the reason why I don't care for multiplayer in my RTS's anymore; because it's pointless.- Steam mod support is fantastic and has a lot of potential to grow for this extended edition.So buy this game! If you love single-player RTS then there is definetly everything you want to find here. People's complaints about multiplayer might be valid but the rest is total purist horsedung. It looks great. It plays great. I haven't had a single crash and the achievements are fun to get. The story mode is interesting and it's a bunch of fun trying out all the different Gods and their followers.It's not perfect and has some flaws and quirks that can annoy you more then me, but this is overall a good game for someone who's never played AoM before.

Don't pay attention to my hours, I had a physical copy since I was in 4th grade.Pros:+Fun challenges, it allows you to tackle the enemy at your own pace so long as you play smart and hold off against their attacks.+The Vanilla campaign + Expansion campaign can clock in about 30 hours+4 ""cultures"", basically 4 civilizations, each with 3 different major gods. Major can impact everything from your units, your god powers and your economy. For example, the Norse have 3 major gods: Loki, Thor and Odin. Loki focuses more on military, Thor focuses more on economy and technology, and Odin is a balance of both. All three of these civilizations have access to most of the same units and buildings though.+Multi-player+Titans are the tightest♥♥♥♥♥♥everCons-$30 for a 2002 game.-Has workshop support but the modding community is long gone.-Atlantis civs are OP.  Not a huge gripe because there's no competitive scene but it's important to know.If you like RTS, buy it, you'll get your moneys worth no problem.			"

The downfall of the game is not the gameplay itself, overall this is a wonderful real time strategy game. The problem is the lack of players, which unfortunatly means a lack of online play. Other than that it is a solid play.			"

												Fans of this classic Microsoft game will appreciate the new Extended Edition. It includes many graphical updates which makes the game much more playable than the older version, and it also includes the amazing Titans expansion which adds unique gameplay elements. The campaign has a nice plot and varied settings to keep you hooked, and there are plenty of interesting unit types not seen in other RTS games. Local multiplayer is extremely fun and a total blast from the past. I recommend picking this game up if you have fond memories of the original, or if you are just looking for a good RTS game to play with some buddies.			"

And this new version of the game is far too much expensive for what it is gives. I absolutely loves the original game for alomst 10 years, but I had only disappointment with this new version :(			"

												Age of Mythology is amazing game. It's still good even though how old the game is. It may look confusing, but it's very easy to learn. Building armies, controlling resources, and razing enemy builds is fun and makes me feel i'm doing something productive by managing all of this. The DLC is also very good despite how much negativity it receives, the DLCs new civilization its pretty neat to use and it's god powers and such are great. For example Nü Wa helps with economy and the minor god Chungli's god power and god upgrades are fantastic, one upgrade makes it so it removes the need to use food and wood for armory upgrades, and his god power invokes an inferno which burns enemy buildings which can help with destroying buildings. One thing is that the Chinese titan looks funny, and that speech sounds hilarious, speaking of that some of them sound like they're saying ""S***"" or ""S***ter"" which is pretty funny. Overall the entire game is one of my favourite games of all time. One thing i'd like is more DLC, add new mythology, like Japanese, Hindu, Aztec, and more.			"

												RTS and heaven are finally combined, or at least close to it! A far cleaner release than AoE2HD, and I like how I can zoom so far; it makes ranked play a lot smoother. A lot of nice small fixes, plus a game that looks nicer, combined with multiplayer and smoother ranked is what makes it worth for me. Remember, that this game does not work on systems that might run the original, it has been severely upgraded, and old components and computers, especially laptops, might not run this. This is a common mistake made by people. Before I get ahead of my self, there are some issues, as well as some imbalancement at release, but everything is under the fix, being patched by the developers as we speak.			"

												RTS and heaven are finally combined, or at least close to it! A far cleaner release than AoE2HD, and I like how I can zoom so far; it makes ranked play a lot smoother. A lot of nice small fixes, plus a game that looks nicer, combined with multiplayer and smoother ranked is what makes it worth for me. Remember, that this game does not work on systems that might run the original, it has been severely upgraded, and old components and computers, especially laptops, might not run this. This is a common mistake made by people. Before I get ahead of my self, there are some issues, as well as some imbalancement at release, but everything is under the fix, being patched by the developers as we speak.			"

												Where to begin...Age of Mythology is a classic RTS and this Extended Edition is essentially what Age of Empire 2's HD re-release is to the Age of Mythology series.First off the negative:- It is just a HD re-release... That is literally all that can be said...Now for the positive:- The smoke, fire, water, mist and fog effects have all been spruced up. The terrain textures also seem to be vastly improved. What's more, day and night cycles actually changed the shadow effects and lighting. All good and, to be honest is expected from a re-release... Steam Multiplayer, get in! No more fussing about with Hamachi/Gameranger nonsense and/or messing with IP/Net configuration to get that old copy working. Many old maps and scripts are being ported/compiled for this version via Steam Workshop Steam workshop, he he he Includes the short Nord Campaign from the old demo for Age of Mythology Includes Titans expansionNow for the sugar on this old RTS classic pudding, new expansion! Is this a must buy now though? Well... if you want less online compatibility issues and actively play the game... why not? If not... I'd suggest you wait for the new expansion. No doubt will have new factions and units... Maybe even Dragon themed titans? Might be cool. There should also, since the new expansion will change multiplayer balance, probably a new patch with re-balancing accross the board... One can hope anyway.TLDR: So is it recommended? Totally...			"

I have done a lot of different settings on the game, and still no luck. Other then that the game is great. The people that made this game should make another game like this without gods.

There are a lot fewer civilizations, bt each one feels a lot more unique, fewer resources to manage, and several of the things you had to work for in age of empires you either recieve straight away, are free, or both. Of course, all is forgiven when you can send a 200 foot bird man rampaging throough your enemy's base. A chinese expansion is slated to come out soon as well.			"

I always prefer to play games on Easy first to learn the basics of a game and then advance from there. It's a little hard to do though when the easiest level is hard. If you are looking for a game that is a little harder and more challenging than it's predecessor, but still is similiar to the other versions. than this would be a good game for you.			"

It runs stable. In my opinion that was enough to buy it, without regrets.Would recommend to new players. Would recommend if you've lost your orignal copy.

												By far my favourite of the ""Age of _"" series, and one I wish they'd do a sequel to (or more expansions for). It took what worked from AoE2 and gave it more depth, better graphics, and some really unique and fun campaigns. I particularly liked that each faction was very different (compared to the minimal differences in the AoE series). Still as good now as when it released.			"

												What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? The enhanced edition isn't much different from the original version, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  AoM is still one of the greatest RTS games ever made even to this day.  The different civilizations play differently enough to make it feel unique enough, but still mostly maintain a balanced feel.  The biggest issue I have with the game is the Titan units that were introduced in the original expansion.  They are too OP and do not feel balanced.  Luckily you can choose to disable them at the start of a game, which is my preferred play style.  Overall though this is a fantastic game, so do yourself a favor and make sure it is in your library!			"

												It's good but overpriced. Wait for it to go on sale if you really want it. The different gods are somewhat unbalanced, but in a good way. If you have everything /perfectly/ balanced in a game, it becomes boring, and there are never any new developments in strategy. This game doesn't have that problem. One problem it does have, however, is the playerbase. There aren't enough people playing, so if you've got friends you're playing it with, or you're fine with waiting 20 minutes for people to join, or you're mostly interested in the singleplayer (which I don't think anyone is) then it's definitely worth your time.

												This is the best game I have ever played. Not even joking. Never, in the entire history of my life, have I played a game I enjoyed more than this one. Everything about it is wonderful, or at least in my opinion they are.First off, the amount of mythology that's in the game is, for the most part, a dream come true for me. I've always been a fan of the mythology from Greek and Norse times, so a game based around that sort of thing is pure awesome.The gameplay itself is stellar for an RTS game. More or less standard stuff, you build a base, build an army, kill everyone. However, it is so smooth and so rewarding seeing your accomplishments once you've done this. It also does some other things to help seperate it from other RTS's, including using a God Power system where you can benefit yourself through various powers.The graphics are pretty darn good for a game from 2001 or earlier. The models themselves are dated, but everything else is perfectly fine by my standards.The game also has a damn good story, and an expansion pack inside it as well. Plenty of content.It also has multiplayer, which appears to have been fixed, seeing as I don't get much lag from playing it.10/10, play the ♥♥♥♥ing game already.			"

												One of the more forgiving RTSs out there.  Giving each civ a different learning curve was fun too; Greeks well suit those who want to build up huge armies, Egyptians suit those who like a more economic approach and Norse suit those who like early game rushes.  The only thing that I don't like is the game can kind of drag.  It normally takes at least four or five attacks for either side to win, even after an effective first attack all but secures who wins.Aside from that, I HIGHLY recommend this game.  Especially if you played it growing up.  Great Nostalgic value.			"

												I can recommend this game if your after a good RTS from the old days. Everything else that the original game had is indeed here, with a few audio issues.  And honestly the visuals haven't seen that much improvement beyond better water, terrain and resolution.If you really liked AoM from the old days then this game would be perfect for you.  Gameplay wise it plays out as any other Age of Empires game, albiet with mythological units as opposed to realisitc ones.  So expect monsters to play a big part in this game.The one real problem with this game is the really bad Twitch integration.  It doesn't tell you when your streaming, the stream chat doesn't show up anywhere in game and the quality is the worst I have ever seen. A lazy half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥effort on the developers part, and there doesn't seem to be any signs of it improving.Now should you buy this version over the original?  Yes, the fact of the matter is that the original version of this game has a hell of a hard time working on modern day systems.  However I wouldn't pay the full asking price for this updated version.			"

												Age of Mythology Extended Edition is, for me, an okay RTS. I see how it can appeal to fans of the series, but since I am a seasoned rts-player I have seen and played better. The extended part of the game leaves much to be desired. A slight upgrade in graphics and an overall smoother experience. But other than that not much else. I don't recommend buying this, unless you are a fan of the series or it is on sale, as it is currently at the time of writing.			"

												This is one of my all-time favorite RTS games! This game has a special place in my heart for it was one of a few games that I could play with all three of my brothers. It has classic graphics that were redone pretty well in the remaster. The gameplay mechanics are as amazing as I remember and I love the different maps that you can play. The online mode is pretty underwhelming the last time I played this game, but I played the game in it's peak where you would find well over 1000 matches and maps going on at a time. I would highly suggest this game to those looking for a RTS and love Greek Mythology.			"

												This is the best game I have ever played. Not even joking. Never, in the entire history of my life, have I played a game I enjoyed more than this one. Everything about it is wonderful, or at least in my opinion they are.First off, the amount of mythology that's in the game is, for the most part, a dream come true for me. I've always been a fan of the mythology from Greek and Norse times, so a game based around that sort of thing is pure awesome.The gameplay itself is stellar for an RTS game. More or less standard stuff, you build a base, build an army, kill everyone. However, it is so smooth and so rewarding seeing your accomplishments once you've done this. It also does some other things to help seperate it from other RTS's, including using a God Power system where you can benefit yourself through various powers.The graphics are pretty darn good for a game from 2001 or earlier. The models themselves are dated, but everything else is perfectly fine by my standards.The game also has a damn good story, and an expansion pack inside it as well. Plenty of content.It also has multiplayer, which appears to have been fixed, seeing as I don't get much lag from playing it.10/10, play the ♥♥♥♥ing game already.			"

												Man... I remember having so many good memories with this game, a lot of people back when i was in high school were playing this, everyone was having fun, a couple of other guys where talking about Mw2 while me and my friends were talking about this game. What more is to say? It's an rts, in my opinion a great game, it's a lot like age of empires, if you replace de military units with mithological, ficticious ones, the game has truly a lot of soul put into it, and i seriously wonder if even now with the amazing level of comercialism in the industry a game such as this one could exist, either way, it's a good game, brings me a lot of good memories, and remains fresh as ever.

												One of the more forgiving RTSs out there.  Giving each civ a different learning curve was fun too; Greeks well suit those who want to build up huge armies, Egyptians suit those who like a more economic approach and Norse suit those who like early game rushes.  The only thing that I don't like is the game can kind of drag.  It normally takes at least four or five attacks for either side to win, even after an effective first attack all but secures who wins.Aside from that, I HIGHLY recommend this game.  Especially if you played it growing up.  Great Nostalgic value.			"

												The neglected cousin of the ""Age of Empires"" series, this mythology-themed real-time strategy is an underrated classic. It's incredibly satisfying to smite your opponent with Zeus' lightning bolt, or rain meteors down upon their city, or summon a mighty Titan to smash through their battle lines. Worshiping different gods provides different god powers, allowing for plenty of variety in play style. The single-player campaign is solid, and there's plenty of variety in maps and game modes to play stand-alone matches. This game needed a sequel. It's great.			"

												Was obsessed with the game back in the early 2000s when it was first released. In my opinion the game still holds up even today and it's nice that there is an updated HD-version here on Steam. Maybe it's some nostalgia at play as well, but for those looking for a fun RTS-game this is worth checking out. Have not spent much time playing AoM in multiplayer, but the game contains a couple of cozy singleplayer campaigns which you can sink a lot of hours into.			"

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is an amazing game. With the power of the gods on your side you build up a mighty empire and an awesome army. With 15 diffrent major gods to choose from(each with entirely diffrent abilities, unique units and ways of playing) its never boring. The graphics are pretty good and some of the animation is spectacular, like when a Titan stomps on the ground sending your puny little troops flying into the air. Definetly one of my favorite strategy games.I do have one complaint though the population cap is a little small. That being said the game is still great in its entirerty.			"

												Age of Mythology has been a favorite game since childhood. The new Chinese expansion was a letdown. It has lots of bugs and the gameplay is slightly slower. Nevertheless, it is more gameplay which has been nice. Overall, I would recomend this game, and even though the new expansion wasn't what we wanted, it is still super fun to play.			"

												Certainly a must-buy game. It is an old time classic with updates. I was playing it since it was first released back at 2002. Since then every once in a while I'm returning an playing a couple of games, never get bored of it. Everybody I recommend you go and see the credits of this game ... its back from when they where creating it with some easter-eggs and its very fulfilling watching this! I wish some day they release a second version of this.			"

												things I liked about the game-typical age of empires quality game-get to command mythological creaturesthing I didnt likeStupid AI (just like AoE2 you cant really attack move to a location you can either move to a location and your units will happily walk there without a care in the world even while being attacked by an opposing army the entire way to reach that point or you can click each individual unit you want your squad to take out. frankly they dont have an easy attack move option like in starcraft which is annoying)so if you like age of empires 2 you will likely like this game too			"

												If you want a nostalgic feeling, a well written campaign with improved graphics, and some balances, then AoM:EE was made for you. The optimalisation is not the best, but as my childhood favourite, it could not disappoint me in any ways. The online scene is weak, but the game offers challenging scenarios (if the difficulty is on hard/titan), and an enjoyable story too! It also features a map editor, which I found myself derping arround with more than one should. I recommend playing with friends!			"

												This game is my most played steam game in my library by far. The main reason I prefer it to the other ensemble RTS Age games (and I've played them all) is the autoque feature for automatically building villagers at the TC. I dont want to have to remember every 60 seconds or whatever it is to select the TC and create another villager. I dont have the type of brain that is able to remember to do that. As such, I am able to remain competitive in this game moreso than the other games, and thusly have more fun online because I have a chance of winning at least.I also bought five copies of this during a sale and gave them to my friends and we had a BLAST relearning and playing this game together, until the players eventually fell apart due to personal issues (not related to the game). The people online might be a bit too skilled, so you might want to consider rounding up some friends to play, if you can do that you'll have lots of fun and its well worth the time and effort for everyone to learn it. (Offer to give your friends free copies of the game via steams gifting system in exchange for their promise to learn and play the game with you). Im really looking forward to the expansion that is rumored to be in development too!!! There really is no game that can match this in terms of multiplayer replay value, and there are still plenty of strategy guides left over from 10 years ago, all of which are still valid (thank  goodness) because the game balance was wisely left untouched by the people who brought this game to steam.

Now this game has better multiplayer and even a workshop. This is One of the top rts out there!, Atleast in my opinion. But thats just nostalgia reasons.			"

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is an amazing game. With the power of the gods on your side you build up a mighty empire and an awesome army. With 15 diffrent major gods to choose from(each with entirely diffrent abilities, unique units and ways of playing) its never boring. The graphics are pretty good and some of the animation is spectacular, like when a Titan stomps on the ground sending your puny little troops flying into the air. Definetly one of my favorite strategy games.I do have one complaint though the population cap is a little small. That being said the game is still great in its entirerty.			"

												Age of Mythology has been a favorite game since childhood. The new Chinese expansion was a letdown. It has lots of bugs and the gameplay is slightly slower. Nevertheless, it is more gameplay which has been nice. Overall, I would recomend this game, and even though the new expansion wasn't what we wanted, it is still super fun to play.			"

												Certainly a must-buy game. It is an old time classic with updates. I was playing it since it was first released back at 2002. Since then every once in a while I'm returning an playing a couple of games, never get bored of it. Everybody I recommend you go and see the credits of this game ... its back from when they where creating it with some easter-eggs and its very fulfilling watching this! I wish some day they release a second version of this.			"

												things I liked about the game-typical age of empires quality game-get to command mythological creaturesthing I didnt likeStupid AI (just like AoE2 you cant really attack move to a location you can either move to a location and your units will happily walk there without a care in the world even while being attacked by an opposing army the entire way to reach that point or you can click each individual unit you want your squad to take out. frankly they dont have an easy attack move option like in starcraft which is annoying)so if you like age of empires 2 you will likely like this game too			"

												If you want a nostalgic feeling, a well written campaign with improved graphics, and some balances, then AoM:EE was made for you. The optimalisation is not the best, but as my childhood favourite, it could not disappoint me in any ways. The online scene is weak, but the game offers challenging scenarios (if the difficulty is on hard/titan), and an enjoyable story too! It also features a map editor, which I found myself derping arround with more than one should. I recommend playing with friends!			"

												I certainly recommend the game, as I put a lot of hours into it when it first came out.  Finding it on Steam provided me with the chance to enjoy it again.Unfortunately, it does not come without some issues, as in the last few weeks I have had one in ten games just shut down and restart after half an hour or so of play.  It gets a bit annoying to get through the initial stages of competition with the other civilizations, come to the point where I am starting to pull ahead, and lose it all. "

												Overall a very fun game.... although with the new expansion it makes creating a random map somewhat problematic.  I like playing random 1-player maps against AI opponents.  I attempted to create about 5 random games and each time it chose only from the new DLC for the opponents.  At least 2 games had all 3 AI opponents using the same DLC major god.  Since I do not have the new expansion it would generate the game, load it in, and then immediately force me to quit back to the menu because the AIs were using things from the DLC that I am not yet able to buy.It was extremely frustrating so I am likely just going to put this game on the backburner for a few months and maybe come back to it later.

												When I had first purchased this Extended Edition of Age of Mythology, it was buggy and the graphics of the game were under par. Now, after some serious patchwork, this game is the revived experience that I have been looking for! With enhanced graphical features that add more definition to the environment that you are playing in as well as the added feature of adding day and night cycle lighting, the world of Age of Mythology is made more stunning than the original release. New maps have also been added through preceding updates that also tests players to try new styles of play.Simply put, for those who have nostalgic memories of playing this game or would like to play a classic made by Ensemble Studios (and a game enhanced by SkyBox Labs), Age of Mthology: Extended Edition is a game that I would recommend. (I should mention, however, that you should probably select the properties of the game in your library and under ""BETAS"" you should select the beta titled ""Preview Patch Beta"" before you initiate gameplay in Age of Mythology: Extended Edition.)

												TL DR: Kalos!TL DR2: If you bought the original, the steam version is worth paying for too.I bought the original DVD case with all the posters and big manuals that use to be included in games, a long time ago in my youth. Way before DLC was a thing...If you discount Half Life 1, this game is probably one of the best games ever made and I'm not a huge RTS player. So when it came to steam and I discovered there was a small DLC coming after 10 years I threw my money at them and bought it (after all the devs deserved being paid twice, even if the original game is on my shelf).This game isn't a full flesh remaster, but it does a good job of tarting up the ancient graphics to how you probably remember them. So its still acceptable by today's graphics standards.The DLC is great and well worth the £6, it makes a fantastic addition to an already godly game. I must note that they have made the most out of the limited old textures. Secondly it has a new campaign! - A Rare sight for DLC these days or even new games *cough* EA.I've seen a lot of complaints about the new expansion and mostly its down to people expecting £30 DLC for the actual price of £6.Long and short here's some good and bad points;Good;-Amazing game play for ALL skill levels worth its keep with campaign alone-Great cheesy cut scenes-Multiplayer is great and all its old maps coming through on the steam workshop-Great graphics with this extended edition-Voulume!-The DLC is great-The mythology theme is just epicBad;-Online player base is lacking :-(-Online can sometimes lag-Textures are limited to 512x512 (old game engine limitation sadly)I hope to boost the online scene, so I urge you to check out the sub-reddit /r/AgeofMythology/ Thank you :-). Last words; WORTH A BUY ten times over!			"

												This is the best game I have ever played. Not even joking. Never, in the entire history of my life, have I played a game I enjoyed more than this one. Everything about it is wonderful, or at least in my opinion they are.First off, the amount of mythology that's in the game is, for the most part, a dream come true for me. I've always been a fan of the mythology from Greek and Norse times, so a game based around that sort of thing is pure awesome.The gameplay itself is stellar for an RTS game. More or less standard stuff, you build a base, build an army, kill everyone. However, it is so smooth and so rewarding seeing your accomplishments once you've done this. It also does some other things to help seperate it from other RTS's, including using a God Power system where you can benefit yourself through various powers.The graphics are pretty darn good for a game from 2001 or earlier. The models themselves are dated, but everything else is perfectly fine by my standards.The game also has a damn good story, and an expansion pack inside it as well. Plenty of content.It also has multiplayer, which appears to have been fixed, seeing as I don't get much lag from playing it.10/10, play the ♥♥♥♥ing game already.			"

What more is to say? It's an rts, in my opinion a great game, it's a lot like age of empires, if you replace de military units with mithological, ficticious ones, the game has truly a lot of soul put into it, and i seriously wonder if even now with the amazing level of comercialism in the industry a game such as this one could exist, either way, it's a good game, brings me a lot of good memories, and remains fresh as ever.

												One of the more forgiving RTSs out there.  Giving each civ a different learning curve was fun too; Greeks well suit those who want to build up huge armies, Egyptians suit those who like a more economic approach and Norse suit those who like early game rushes.  The only thing that I don't like is the game can kind of drag.  It normally takes at least four or five attacks for either side to win, even after an effective first attack all but secures who wins.Aside from that, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

												The neglected cousin of the ""Age of Empires"" series, this mythology-themed real-time strategy is an underrated classic. It's incredibly satisfying to smite your opponent with Zeus' lightning bolt, or rain meteors down upon their city, or summon a mighty Titan to smash through their battle lines. Worshiping different gods provides different god powers, allowing for plenty of variety in play style. The single-player campaign is solid, and there's plenty of variety in maps and game modes to play stand-alone matches. This game needed a sequel. It's great.			"

												I always do my reviews with a should you buy it and will you like it approach with pros and cons.Should you buy it: If it's on sale onlyWill you like it: if you enjoy old school RTS games then yes but there are some marks against itPros:+ Nice campaign+ Many 'civ's to choose from that alter game play experience+ Multiplayer fun when it works (not often)+ Ai is pretty good with lots of 'presets'+ Good graphics but nothing special+ Old school rts - harvest resources, build units, kick buttCons:- Lots of technical difficulties from not installing correctly on friends PC to constant desyncing on multiplayer-  Sometimes AI will single you out and just abuse you straight up no chance to fight back (against 3 or more at once) - how do they know to do this even if on seperate teams - of course they fight each other after I'm nearly dead- Compared to any curent RTS its pretty lackluster so if you are younger you might not enjoy it as much as say a Stacraft 2 or Company of Heroes 2- Just not that fun to be honest - had a lot more fun with Warhammer 40k, SC2, C&C3, Age of Empires, Empire Earth, etc.It's a tier below those listed games in terms of fun factor imo but its a worthy game if you are a huge RTS fan. I think your money can be spent on better games to be honest. If it's on sale then yes get it. "

												New faction - the Chinese really opens up gameplay to a lot of new options.  They have a lot of easily spammed units, which makes them the new kings of early rushing.  Game is also a bit more balanced than I remember it.  Back in 2003, the Greeks had a very limited ability to heal, and the Vikings were helpless against flying units.  Looks like the introduction of several new units repairs these garing imbalances.  Egyptians get some love as well, their new Khopesh swordsman units are some fast goons that are super effective at killing villagers.  Savage mate. I played this game nearly a decade ago, when ensemble studios was in charge, and I'm glad to say that forgotton kingdoms has carried on the torch of ensemble.  Hope that there is new content in the future, the community is really looking forward to it.			"

												Age of Mythology. far back in the distant era of 2003, back on my parent's old compaq desktop, i discovered the magic of this game. even better, i was only 3 at the time. it opened up a whole new world for me. it let me play god, it let me send men and women to their deaths, and it let me have a pegasus for only 50 food and 2 favor. it was great. i actualy learned to spell with this game. i didn't know the joy of copy paste at the time, so when i wanted a cheat code, which i did, i had to write them down on a piece of paper for later. and then write it again in game. in short, i learned to spell summoning lazer bears. and i was overjoyed when the titans expansion came out. so much so, that i bought copies for myself, and all my friends. i had a blast. and suddenly, the Tale of The DRagon comes around. over a decade of waiting! it's finaly here! and...it was ok. i love the new civilization, and all the new gods and god powers. the campaign was meh. it was no Fall of The Trident. but really, what is? but sentimentality aside, what are the pros and cons of this game?PROS:it's age of mythology.pegasus (for only 50 food and 2 favor!)a solid RTS.the editor is fun as heck.CONS:multiplayer is...lacking. i'm not a huge competitive player, and i prefer the random matches, but i can see how people can have issues with it. its problems are part of the reason i don't do it.for all that's in this game, 30 bucks is a bit too much. plus 10 for the expansion. if you have 40 spare bucks, and nothing else to spend them on, this game is worth it. but other than that, wait for a sale.and most importantly, the Traitor god power. it has two glaring issues.1) it can be used on Lazer Bear2) no one has made a mod that replaces its ""whhoosh"" noise with the ""TRAITOR"" audio from the force awakens.all in all, it gets an 8.5/10			"

Posted: November 6, 2015
												This game is my most played steam game in my library by far. The main reason I prefer it to the other ensemble RTS Age games (and I've played them all) is the autoque feature for automatically building villagers at the TC. I dont want to have to remember every 60 seconds or whatever it is to select the TC and create another villager. I dont have the type of brain that is able to remember to do that. As such, I am able to remain competitive in this game moreso than the other games, and thusly have more fun online because I have a chance of winning at least.I also bought five copies of this during a sale and gave them to my friends and we had a BLAST relearning and playing this game together, until the players eventually fell apart due to personal issues (not related to the game). The people online might be a bit too skilled, so you might want to consider rounding up some friends to play, if you can do that you'll have lots of fun and its well worth the time and effort for everyone to learn it. (Offer to give your friends free copies of the game via steams gifting system in exchange for their promise to learn and play the game with you). Im really looking forward to the expansion that is rumored to be in development too!!! There really is no game that can match this in terms of multiplayer replay value, and there are still plenty of strategy guides left over from 10 years ago, all of which are still valid (thank  goodness) because the game balance was wisely left untouched by the people who brought this game to steam.

												This Game had brought some amazing memories. The remake is actually mostly good looking. I was surprised to find this on the steam store. So I had to try it and that really made me happy to see this game come back with some neat features such as Day/Night Cycle, which makes the game seem more lively. Now this game has better multiplayer and even a workshop. This is One of the top rts out there!, Atleast in my opinion. But thats just nostalgia reasons.			"

Mean Mr. Mustard's short Age of Mythology: Extended Edition review 1) Essential - buy it NOW 2) Recommended - buy it on sale 3) AvoidTime to complete - 16 hours to finish main campaign and a few skirmish games.Played multiplayer? NoWorth revisiting? Yes, to play the included ""The New Atlantis"" campaign and more skirmish games. Best part - Massive variety, 4 factions to play as, 12 major gods to worship, 36 minor gods to worship, each with their own unique abilities and units.Worst part - High asking price for a 10+ year old game.

												Troubled sleep,This is a game that I always come back to, time and time again. In fact, besides age of empires gold edition this was my first game I ever owned on a PC. I could not get enough of this game back in the day. I clocked soo many hours into it the timer would say ""damn"" Now before I go into detail on why I should reccomend this game I should talk about the problems I ran into1. The visuals.Maybe it is just me but the new grass textures just destroys my eyes. I actually got a headache playing my first match on Islands. The textures are not bad but they seem too grainy but hey its age of mythology.2. GlitchesI ran into this problem alot trying to face multiple enemies one would not even appear on the map and the other would just sit there and do literally nothing. Also, I ran into problems with icons for certain units not appearing for instance the anti-foreign soldiers of egyptians would just be a blank icon. 3. DLC glitchesthis is only for the people that bought the game and not its expansion alot of times when trying to load a random map with a random enemy for some reason the dlc somehow glitches itself into the game crashing it and forcing me back to the main menu.... 4. Sill has that AI jumpThis is a problem for alot of beginners, when you first play on aom its more than likely on easy and the enemy will basically stand stil until very late in the game, well lets play moderate and you are chugging along and all of a sudden at about 7:31 you see a sizeable force of random soldiers slaughtering all of your villagers... If I ask for a patch it is this... FIX the AI difficulty curve it is wayy to steep and it could poetentially break a sale away from the company., (please note that these are the things I saw in the game and your experiance will more than likely vary.)On to the reccomendationsThe visuals,While not major I got a good glimpse at the incrase of quality that was transferred over from its 2000's counterpart. Alot of the edges of buildings are alot smoother and a AI animations and textures run ALOT smoother. This provides the user with a more stable and smoother running game than sometimes before. Slight AI improvementI found this out while fighting certain enemies I could not exploit mechanics like I used to be able to. I saw that the AI had more flexablility than what it used to be. Now this does have a problem. The AI is still STUPID, military units still have that dumb short range of sight and wont hesitate to move if you destroy everything AROUND that circle of sight. What I likeSoo I touched on more bad things than I did good, dont get me wrong. I love this game it brings back alot of memories and what I touched on in my review is the differences that I saw ( or none there of). This game is still a really great and balanced RTS game even to this day. Its simplicity and yet it complex structure is what makes me always come back to it.			"

												Very good old RTS.  This is a bit graphics heavy for a remake of an old game.  I would definitely recommend making sure you exceed min specs if your computer is a bit older.  The new enviroment is certainly not ESO.  It lacks a lot of the nice ESO but hopefully these will get added in the expansion pack.  Overall it is still a good fun game to play with friends.			"

												I love this game.I first bought the game in CD format used from gamestop a long long while back, and was quickly addicted. However, the disk was already in shoddy condition, and over the years it just became in worse and worse shape until it would no longer install (I was young and stupid and didn't take good care of my♥♥♥♥♥♥at the time so faults on me for that lol)But least to say, I was so excited to see this rereleased on Steam and have since been playing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it again. I've not had any of the issues listed by other reviewers in regards to not being able to play or game breaking glitches. Only issue I had is freezing every once and a while, and while annoying, it always fixes itself after a few seconds (should be noted that this freezing has only happened since I've purchased the DLC.) My greek units also aren't holding any weapons for some reason lol they still work like normal, it just looks strange, and I suspect it has to do with the new DLC as well. I also don't really play online so I can't really give any input on the issues some users are reporting on that,Should such an old game be priced so high, even if it's remastered? No, probably not, I'd wait for it to go on sale if you plan to purchase. But It's still a very fun and enjoyable game regardless, and one of my all time favorite strategies.			"

												Best out of the genre created by Ensemble in my humble opinion.  All cultures seem to be fairly well balanced when it comes to gameplay.  I have played this game when it came out and am really pleased to see Steam greenlight this project.  If you don't know much about mythology, it has plenty of information to read when it comes to learning about the ancient beliefs and the units you play.  I rank this above all the Age of Empires for its gameplay mostly, and not just a fondness of mythology.  Good luck, have fun.			"

Comecei a jogar quando era jovem em 2003 e até hoje não largo esse clássico, O que gosto muito do AoM em comparação aos outros ages é a diferença grande de cada civilização, o que da uma diversidade grande e é bastante equilibrado também.O melhor RTS já feito.

												I've been playing Age of Mythology long before the extended edition, The story as well as the titan expansion (which is included) are amazing. There are plenty of extra quirks like God powers that I feel put it above Age of Empires. It is very well balanced and each civilization you play as is a new unique experience. The only thing to be aware of is that the original game came out over a decade ago, and even with extended edition, the graphics are dated. That being said, this game is definitely worth getting if you like RTS games, its a classic that will provide a lot of fun and frustration as you conquer your enemies or build up your settlements. Is-volee!			"

												I really like the atmosphere of this game. The different mythologies are very well mixed, without getting ridiculous. Besides the single and multiplayer options, the map editor offers plenty of abilities (especially with the triggers functions). I could for example create scenario's in which you would change players every few minutes, allowing for completely different strategic choices.I didn't encounter the bugs that others speak about, but then I didn't play in the past few months. However, I never really liked the multiplayer in Age of Mythology, because it feels to hasty for me: you need a precise timing and lots of hotkey bashing in order to win. This takes away the relaxed feel that the game has for me in single player.Don't buy it full price, it's way too old for that. Below 10 euro's it can be fun :).			"

												An excellent game for fans of RTSs or anyone. Highly appealing to children but also contains deep strategy for those that care to learn it. The original single-player story is excellent; I've played it numerous times since I was a child. This version isn't particularly extended, but it is slightly improved, with the exception of the multi-player issues that plague the online community. A number of minor bugs have been fixed since the disc version, but a few more have also been introduced. Hopefully, the developers will fix it up eventually.			"

												One of the best overall RTS games ever made. It is great to see it return and make a comeback. Full of history, mysticism,intrigue and of course strategic battles and just sheer mayhem at times. That feeling of triumph when you bare down upon your enemy to seize victory or that sinking feeling you have when your base is overwhelmed by enemy forces bent on destruction.With Steam Workshop integration, Steam trading cards and achievements there's a lot of value. Perhaps the greatest addition is the DLC Land Of The Dragon (for an additional price) which brings the Legends and Mysticism of the Chinese Civilization to life in a campaign and a playable civilization. That is in itself one of the greatest additions there have been to this game. It is for certain my next steam purchase without question.It would be nice to see some other civilizations find their way as add-ons as well. Perhaps an addon that adds Japan, India, Korea, Maya or Aztecs, Babylonians, Polynesians, Aboriginal as well. All have a rich cultural background and a pantheon of deities from which to draw a great deal of mythological based content and gameplay. I hope that Skybox are evaluating that opportunity and that such a market exists for expansion. Obviously bundling a few civilizations in one expansion would be feasible and likely have a market on Steam and draw a much wider audience.Not to mention the new features like:- Support for HD high resolution- 3D Hardware features like FXAA and Ambient Occlusion- In game day/night cycle- Internet and LAN multiplayer- Numerous tweaksIt's a great value if you're a fan of the RTS genre or a fan of the Age Of Empires series. All the tweaks that make the game less about micromanagement like infinite farms (farms don't neet to be reseeded), automatic build queue and many other featuires. Highly recommended. Many hours of replay value.			"

												The game is amazing and offer a solid basis to know where to start learning the three most famous mythologies; even for those who don't even like mythology they have fun in making 'monsters' and using divine power - is a totally different experience from age of empires (and both are great).I wasn't too excited for this expansion, but I was just playing and it's awesome! I think I got too disapointed with the atlantean one and then this came surprisingly good. The adition of the monks make a huge difference; it also allowed for me to think how exception it would be with more things like being able to change terrain (mountians now have passages to go up) and to mount the mythological creature - things like that.Well, in short, the game is expetacular and I am looking forward to the expansion being a huge sucess and they decide to launh an age of mythology two (hopefully improve graphics without making the game cofunsing like AoE III).

												This is the best game I have ever played. Not even joking. Never, in the entire history of my life, have I played a game I enjoyed more than this one. Everything about it is wonderful, or at least in my opinion they are.First off, the amount of mythology that's in the game is, for the most part, a dream come true for me. I've always been a fan of the mythology from Greek and Norse times, so a game based around that sort of thing is pure awesome.The gameplay itself is stellar for an RTS game. More or less standard stuff, you build a base, build an army, kill everyone. However, it is so smooth and so rewarding seeing your accomplishments once you've done this. It also does some other things to help seperate it from other RTS's, including using a God Power system where you can benefit yourself through various powers.The graphics are pretty darn good for a game from 2001 or earlier. The models themselves are dated, but everything else is perfectly fine by my standards.The game also has a damn good story, and an expansion pack inside it as well. Plenty of content.It also has multiplayer, which appears to have been fixed, seeing as I don't get much lag from playing it.10/10, play the ♥♥♥♥ing game already.			"

What more is to say? It's an rts, in my opinion a great game, it's a lot like age of empires, if you replace de military units with mithological, ficticious ones, the game has truly a lot of soul put into it, and i seriously wonder if even now with the amazing level of comercialism in the industry a game such as this one could exist, either way, it's a good game, brings me a lot of good memories, and remains fresh as ever.

												One of the more forgiving RTSs out there.  Giving each civ a different learning curve was fun too; Greeks well suit those who want to build up huge armies, Egyptians suit those who like a more economic approach and Norse suit those who like early game rushes.  The only thing that I don't like is the game can kind of drag.  It normally takes at least four or five attacks for either side to win, even after an effective first attack all but secures who wins.Aside from that, I HIGHLY recommend this game.  Especially if you played it growing up.  Great Nostalgic value.			"

												The neglected cousin of the ""Age of Empires"" series, this mythology-themed real-time strategy is an underrated classic. It's incredibly satisfying to smite your opponent with Zeus' lightning bolt, or rain meteors down upon their city, or summon a mighty Titan to smash through their battle lines. Worshiping different gods provides different god powers, allowing for plenty of variety in play style. The single-player campaign is solid, and there's plenty of variety in maps and game modes to play stand-alone matches. This game needed a sequel. It's great.			"

												This game is a fun RTS that is for casual gaming and brings a historical/mythological aspect to a game like Starcraft. As in the title, its with the gods of the old era and is a diffrent take on say Age of Empires does but doesnt fault in any aspect of quality. Would recommend anyone wanting to get into playing fun RTS's, wait till it goes on sale though.			"

												A Perfect spinoff of Age Of Empires, Age of Mythology is an outstanding game for those who enjoy RTS games. Each culture has a unique play style that adds hours of diverse gameplay with different powers, units, tech trees and more for each civilization. It has a long and varied campaign that will keep you busy for weeks to come and add with that a great map editing tool, custom games and all of the DLC's in one package this is a great deal for those looking for something similar to Age Of Empires.

												I always do my reviews with a should you buy it and will you like it approach with pros and cons.Should you buy it: If it's on sale onlyWill you like it: if you enjoy old school RTS games then yes but there are some marks against itPros:+ Nice campaign+ Many 'civ's to choose from that alter game play experience+ Multiplayer fun when it works (not often)+ Ai is pretty good with lots of 'presets'+ Good graphics but nothing special+ Old school rts - harvest resources, build units, kick buttCons:- Lots of technical difficulties from not installing correctly on friends PC to constant desyncing on multiplayer-  Sometimes AI will single you out and just abuse you straight up no chance to fight back (against 3 or more at once) - how do they know to do this even if on seperate teams - of course they fight each other after I'm nearly dead- Compared to any curent RTS its pretty lackluster so if you are younger you might not enjoy it as much as say a Stacraft 2 or Company of Heroes 2- Just not that fun to be honest - had a lot more fun with Warhammer 40k, SC2, C&C3, Age of Empires, Empire Earth, etc.It's a tier below those listed games in terms of fun factor imo but its a worthy game if you are a huge RTS fan. I think your money can be spent on better games to be honest. If it's on sale then yes get it. "

												This is one of my all-time favorite RTS games! This game has a special place in my heart for it was one of a few games that I could play with all three of my brothers. It has classic graphics that were redone pretty well in the remaster. The gameplay mechanics are as amazing as I remember and I love the different maps that you can play. The online mode is pretty underwhelming the last time I played this game, but I played the game in it's peak where you would find well over 1000 matches and maps going on at a time. I would highly suggest this game to those looking for a RTS and love Greek Mythology.			"

												Age of Mythology. far back in the distant era of 2003, back on my parent's old compaq desktop, i discovered the magic of this game. even better, i was only 3 at the time. it opened up a whole new world for me. it let me play god, it let me send men and women to their deaths, and it let me have a pegasus for only 50 food and 2 favor. it was great. i actualy learned to spell with this game. i didn't know the joy of copy paste at the time, so when i wanted a cheat code, which i did, i had to write them down on a piece of paper for later. and then write it again in game. in short, i learned to spell summoning lazer bears. and i was overjoyed when the titans expansion came out. so much so, that i bought copies for myself, and all my friends. i had a blast. and suddenly, the Tale of The DRagon comes around. over a decade of waiting! it's finaly here! and...it was ok. i love the new civilization, and all the new gods and god powers. the campaign was meh. it was no Fall of The Trident. but really, what is? but sentimentality aside, what are the pros and cons of this game?PROS:it's age of mythology.pegasus (for only 50 food and 2 favor!)a solid RTS.the editor is fun as heck.CONS:multiplayer is...lacking. i'm not a huge competitive player, and i prefer the random matches, but i can see how people can have issues with it. its problems are part of the reason i don't do it.for all that's in this game, 30 bucks is a bit too much. plus 10 for the expansion. if you have 40 spare bucks, and nothing else to spend them on, this game is worth it. but other than that, wait for a sale.and most importantly, the Traitor god power. it has two glaring issues.1) it can be used on Lazer Bear2) no one has made a mod that replaces its ""whhoosh"" noise with the ""TRAITOR"" audio from the force awakens.all in all, it gets an 8.5/10			"

I even installed it on a new HDD with nothing else on it.Just doesn't work anymore.Grew up with this and AoE2, I played them both every single day from when I was three until today, even, and I turn 21 soon.AoE2 came out first, naturally. Mythology was not out until I was like, 11. But still, I made sure I played them every day because they are my favorite games.I even have my pristine copy of AoE1 with the Rise of Rome disk expansion right next to my keyboard as I write this, with the other games under that....That aside, I still can't play the game anymore.I often play it in offline mode since my internet is bad, and I get disconnected constantly, but yeah. I just can't run it anymore no matter what I do.I hope someone finds a fix soon.When the game actually worked, 11/10, do recommend, fun and engaging little twist on mythological characters and deities I grew up learning about and still enjoy reading of to this day.I JUST WANT TO PLAY THIS AGAIN AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH			"

												Nice update to a masterpiece game. A brand new campaign would have been really cool, but the graphical updates give it a 'brand new' feeling. Though the models aren't high-resolution, I think preserving the old helps keep a nostalgic feel to the game.Some minor issues I have are perhaps that units can sometimes be hard to see under dull lighting, and that the title screen's map camera doesn't seem centred. I haven't played much multiplayer, but one game I had with a close-by friend was smooth. Each time I look at the multiplayer there are a few games, but not an awful lot. Hopefully that will change from the Steam sale :pOverall, I'd say it's worth getting if you want a modern version that looks nicer, doesn't require a CD, and will get future updates.			"

												I loved this game as a child, and on redownloading love it still. I downloaded it about a week ago, and quickly had a game against a computer opponent (believing I still had my skill and tactics, I played it on Hard mode, and that was a bad decision on my part)However, after that initial game on the first night of downloading, I have neglected it's use for these 5-6 days as work has beckoned my need, and now I find that on return, I am unable to play this magnificent game.Basically, any time I try to open the game, it comes up with an initial semi-load area (options to 'Play' the game, visit the 'Workshop' etc), and when Play is selected, I get a full-screen of black, my cursor into a loading spiral in the centre of the screen and... well that's just it, there is no and. It just stays there. Forever.Great game, but a massive ♥♥♥♥ing tease if you ask me. 1/10 do not buy.			"

												Great game for its content. The UI and running of the game still needs to be optimised, the HD aspect doesn't seem to impressive and there's little change from the old disc version. However, very entertaining and diverse gameplay.			"

												Age of Mythology. My childhood. The first RTS I ever played, and one of the first video games I sunk hours of my life into. This was a great game! But chancces are, if you're reading this review, you do not have nostalgia to fall back on. For me, seeing this game on sale was a no-brainer - I had to get it and replay it and recapture the magic. So after about 11 years, what is my impression? Well... if you've already played this game, and love it, go for it. But it definitely doesn't stand the test of time, for me. What was fun and groundbreaking and challenging 11 years ago has been repeated many times since in better games. So rather than posting a tired meme or ""PROSTAGOMA 10/10 LOL,"" here is a list of pros and cons for those who have never tried the game and actually want something substiantial to go on.Pros:*One of the only RTSes out there with a focus on ancient culture and the mythology that surrounds them. While other RTSes focus on realism or space exploration, AOM treats the myths of the acient Greeks, the Egyptians, the Norse, and the Atlanteans as if they were real. As a teenager playing this game, I learned a lot about these ancient cultures from this game. Oh, and there's the Atlanteans, because yeah.*Campaign does a decent job of going through all the civilizations and leading you on an adventure.* Mythical creatues will fight for you and destroy things.*God powers will destroy things.Cons:*Even remastered, the graphics are still not great. Which is fine, because it's old.* There are only four different cultures to play as. This is in opposition to pretty much every other RTS I've played, which have 10 at a minimum. It gets pretty boring after a while having to play the same cultures over and over. It would have been nice to add some from Asian or South America - there are tons of options they could have gone with.* It's honestly a step down from Age of Empires 2. It's like it took all the features in that game, and then cut out a bunch of stuff from each feature and then dumbed it down. Fewer cultures, fewer types of buildings, limits on how many buildings you can build so that your camps all end up looking the same. Even the maps are much more boring with less varied terrain. You can't convert enemy units or buildings, your farms stay there forever (which grantes is less annoying, but it still feels dumbed down). Fishing boats stay in place forever as well.* Because of this, there just isn't a lot to do. AI operates in the same way every time, there are only a few different buildings to build or units to create. Since you don't have a lot to build, every city looks the same.* Which is why most people used to focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game. Unfortunately, well, it's been 12 years. Everyone moved on. You can find better multiplayer communities elsewhere.* The campaign is, well, tedious. Rather than focusing on history, they focus on a bunch of stupid characters who barely have a personality. You don't really get a lot of time to build up encampments, and when you do it all goes away moving on to the next campaign, when you've suddenly forgotten all of the technology you learned.* Arkantos' piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥son. I hate that kid. He was the first video game character I ever wanted to see die.Anyway, if you like RTS games, there are a lot better ones you can buy. Age of Empires 2 came out 4 years before this one and yet still has more features. I haven't gotten to AoE III yet, but I'm guessing that would be even better. And this isn't counting the games like Civilization whose complexity blows this game out of the water. Basically, if you think that Age of Empires is just way too difficult and complicated, give this one a try. But having things to do is what makes these games fun. If you played this 12 years ago and are feeling nostalgic or just want to yell at Arkantos's son one more time, go for it. But I don't recommend it for new players.			"

												The main problem with this game is that the enemy AI is poorly coded. They're not fun to play against because they build up tons of defense and an army. But they don't ever leave their base with their army. They use it to defend while they build a wonder. Once you build a wonder, you win the game in 10 minutes. So the AI strategy is to just rush a wonder while defending. Also there is a system in which you have 4 ages. Each age is comparable to a tier in other RTS games...it unlocks new technology and units. The way the game is balanced, advancing your ages faster is a massive advantage. So therefore the game is a rush to the final age and then the game actually starts for real. You can't really be agressive in this game because your army will get stomped by you opponent's towers and base, which have arrow attacks. You need siege weapons to damage buildings, but you don't get them until later on. So the gameplay basically becomes, focus on economy and building up resources for an hour while advancing through the ages as fast as you can. Rush a wonder, or build up an epic army and have one battle at the end of the game. It's very repetitive and doesn't inspire creativity, which is something integral to the RPG genre. Also this game is missing a HUGE feature. The ""a move"". Without it it's a huge pain to manage your units.This is compunded by the fact that the units are so tiny and there are oftentimes hundreds on the screen at once. I simply can't tell what's going on or if I am winning or not. You have to order your men to attack one unit at atime, which messes everything up because they get all gummed up trying to attack the same unit. But there's really nothing else you can do.I bought this game for real cheap on the summer sale. I can't reccomend it for the full price, though, which is why it gets a downvote.			"

												I love this game.I first bought the game in CD format used from gamestop a long long while back, and was quickly addicted. However, the disk was already in shoddy condition, and over the years it just became in worse and worse shape until it would no longer install (I was young and stupid and didn't take good care of my♥♥♥♥♥♥at the time so faults on me for that lol)But least to say, I was so excited to see this rereleased on Steam and have since been playing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it again. I've not had any of the issues listed by other reviewers in regards to not being able to play or game breaking glitches. Only issue I had is freezing every once and a while, and while annoying, it always fixes itself after a few seconds (should be noted that this freezing has only happened since I've purchased the DLC.) My greek units also aren't holding any weapons for some reason lol they still work like normal, it just looks strange, and I suspect it has to do with the new DLC as well. I also don't really play online so I can't really give any input on the issues some users are reporting on that,Should such an old game be priced so high, even if it's remastered? No, probably not, I'd wait for it to go on sale if you plan to purchase. But It's still a very fun and enjoyable game regardless, and one of my all time favorite strategies.			"

												As someone who never played the original I find this game to be great fun for a strategy game.The graphics are pretty outdated but the game is over decade old.The playstyle is dynamic and fast paced.The economic structure in this game is rather simple it only has 3 types of resources and collecting them is as simple as 2 mouse clicks. Making this game focus primarly on combat.The Main storyline has great characters making it a fun campain to go through although the ""titans"" portion of it is bit lacking this is solid 7/10 game "

												I've had a lot of fun with this game since I was a young boy.Pros:Thrilling storyline in the campaignsCharacters are fun and interestingThe 4 different civilizations (5 with the brand-new expansion) are diverse and offer different forms of gameplayMythology is very accurate (though deviation occurs for the sake of gameplay, as is expected)Titan difficulty provides a good challengeThe rock-paper-scissors system for the units makes you think while building your armyTitans, though tedious to get, are a lot of funThe characters and graphics look good, and the advanced graphics in this version make them ever betterGod powers add another level of strategy to the game, and a lot of them are just fun to useCons:Your units AI can be... special. Mine have a habit of prioritizing walls and harmless buildings over enemy units in combat.For some reason, some of the artwork has suffered in quality compared to the originalThe campaigns are fun, but some of the individual missions are frustrating and tediousAjax doesn't get to rip off as many heads as he'd like.Overall, I highly recommend it, particularly to Age of Empire fans and folks with a fondness for mythology. The Tale of the Dragon expansion seems to draw mixed opinions, but since that doesn't come packages with this, I mostly left it out of my review.			"

												I've been playing Age of Mythology long before the extended edition, The story as well as the titan expansion (which is included) are amazing. There are plenty of extra quirks like God powers that I feel put it above Age of Empires. It is very well balanced and each civilization you play as is a new unique experience. The only thing to be aware of is that the original game came out over a decade ago, and even with extended edition, the graphics are dated. That being said, this game is definitely worth getting if you like RTS games, its a classic that will provide a lot of fun and frustration as you conquer your enemies or build up your settlements.

												I've had the extended edition for a while, and a disk copy of the game for allot longer. I can say that while this does polish up the graphics thats about all it does (unless you are interested in multiplayer it has that too).The single player is exactly what you remember if you played the original and the tale of the dragon is well, if you ever downloaded one of those custom campaigns for the original that was clearly made by kids, its allot like that. Chinese myth units look out of place and while the human units look okay they don't add much.The multiplayer works I guess, but I have allot of fun on it and it's what I spend most my time on because when it doesnt desynch it's allot of fun, not many toxic player either which is always a plus.It also has map editor which is actually pretty good, if you like making maps I think you'll like this feature because its very deep and allows whatever you want in terms of control, you can place every unit change a single or multiple units stats, make cutscenes scenarios even mini games like tower defence or rpgs.Overall this is a good game but age of mythology was always a good game. If you expect much more than the original game you will be let down, but It's certainly a welcome edition to my steam library.			"
