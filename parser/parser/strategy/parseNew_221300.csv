												No online multiplayer. Only up to 4 player, yourself plus 1- 3 computer AI. They  just did not put any effort into making this game for the pc. It could have been so much better. Only buy if you are dying to play monopoly and are willing to play by yourself. Also wish it had 1080p option, highest you can set it at is 1680x1050. Runs fine with windows 7 64bit never had a single problem with 33 hours played. I am a huge monopoly fan so i do play it when i am desperate to play.			"

												Monopoly is an old classic from my childhood. I love to play it, and have owned many copies of the broad game. Additionally I’ve owned several video game versions as well. My recommendation on this game is split, as I will expand upon below. With this version there are several things I'd like to comment on...Pros...--Interactive dice roles--Animated piece movement--Changeable backgrounds--Includes two or three of the common/house rules as options--The game allows human players to cheat--There are several advanced features like statistics on how many times you or another player has landed on a property and probability of it happening in the next rollCons...--No Multiplayer (over the internet, you can play with up to three others on the same computer)--Limited to four players whether 3 AI and 1 Human player or 4 Human players the limit is 4 (The board game and several video game counterparts allows for 6-8 players including the predecessor of this version)--The Hard level is not Hard enough (In fact it is a joke)--Several common/house rules are missing as options (as shown in multiple rule books published by Parker Brothers and/or Hasbro, if you include two or three you should include all)--The Community Chest/Chance cards are chosen completely at random every time, so it is possible to get the same card twice in a row or within two or three draws  (something that next to never happens on the board game, but it happens very often in this version)--When you change windows off the Monopoly window the game pauses (instead of finishing the moves for the AI players)--You always face the red side of the board and the camera jerks around constantly to follow the animation ( additionally there is no free movement to see where opponent pieces are on the board)In general as you can see the con list is larger than the pro list, and I could make it larger still. This version of the game is basically just ok. It is a way to pass the time, especially if you like Monopoly. So from that standpoint I would recommend this game.There is no challenge to this game though. Whether you are playing on Easy or Hard you cannot honestly tell the difference.  If you want a challenge I suggest an older version of Monopoly called Monopoly 2008 published by GameHouse and TIKGames. It was and may still be available through realArcade. If not there are still copies available through second hand game stores as it was published on CD as well. In my opinion EA/PopCap Games dropped the ball here as they had an excellent start in this older version when they purchased the rights to this game and the Monopoly brand. Monopoly 2008 still is not multiplayer but it has basically all the house rules as options, and the Hard mode is well hard. So from this standpoint I say pass on this game.All and all there is plenty of room for improvement here. If this game gets updated to fix some of the cons listed above I will remove this review and give it another chance. Until then I just use this game to play with friends, and ignore the AI. It is the only reasonable use in my opinion of this version. The Previous (Monopoly 2008) version is what I play when I want to play the computer.			"

												There are few things more heartbreaking than to have played this game very well, to have established paying properties out in front of the computer players, only to be cheated round after round, hitting every costly spot on the board, while the computer opponents skip happily over your properties turn after turn.Having played hundreds of games against the computer, it's more than obvious that the different skill levels are accomplished by rigging the dice.  At the end of each game, a table of throws shows a natural distribution, more or less, but the timing of when those throws either benefit or hurt you is controlled, without a doubt.  For the ""hard"" level. it's set on a 1/2 - 2/3 bias; whereby you will make good throws 1/3 of the time, while your computer opponents have good throws 2/3 of the time.  Hundreds of games have taught me that.			"

												Monopoly with fancy graphics. You are able to play against 3 opponents. They are either controlled by a ai or yourself. There´s no online multiplayer. There´s no option to change the language.The boardgame revolves around trading properties.  Everything works fine except for one thing.... the ai. The ai never propose a deal in your favor. The ai consistently give eachother what they want for no cost. Games at a higher difficulty becomes a race against the clock. It´is not unusual for the ai to have a hotel before you hit the start tile for the fourth time in the hardest difficulty. As soon as one ai get a few buildings up, the rest of them goes bankrupt to that ai. The ai is so simple in this game that the game itself loses it´s replayability. Each game feels the same, there's no twists or new situations. There's just one pattern for the ai to use and it shows.The whole game feels like a moneygrab.  It´s probably beacuse it lacks the two things you would want from a Pc version. A online multiplayer and a proper Ai. You have to play against real people at your Pc to make this game fun. I would rather buy a physical copy in that case.			"

												How do you screw up a classic beloved board game? Well PopCap and EA managed to do it, even a decade after Monopoly Party, showed the way to victory. This game is about as plain vanilla Monopoly as you can get. There is no creativity or innovation whatsoever. EA could make so much bank off this license, by releasing a well polished, thought out base Monopoly game, and adding sensibly priced DLC that includes new themes like Star Wars or whatnot with extra goodies like new play pieces etc. They could also add multiplayer, and support tournaments, but no, EA wants to release sub par crap like the bloated clueless corporation they are.

												This game is not bad, but I personally think it can do better. Because I have played other PC Monopoly games before and comparing them but this game a bit boring like most Board Games. The only thing they could of improved is having more player counters like the Cannon, Moneybags, but also I've played a Monopoly PC Game near 1999 published by Infogrames, Developed by Artech Studios who added some interesting National Boards and Currencys like Germany, France, Italy, Spain and many more; along with their original currencies or use Euros, even Pounds or Dollars. Plus the Monopoly from 1999 and 2002 edition developed by Artech Studios had online play, but this Steam Version from EA/Popcap does NOT!So that is a no from me, and they should at least put some more effort into it. Maybe make it more ""foreign friendly"" plus Multilingual - like the those National Boards or even those Special Limited Editon ones as a DLC, and a bit more common sense for pleasing players. Afterall we want PC Board Games less boring then the actual real Board Games.But seriously this is almost the same to those ordinary real life Board Games, and its a waste of money to me. EA need to put some effort and common sense on publishing games and find the best Games Developers. I am not kidding you - this game deserves FAR much better than this.If Steam will release like Monopoly Deluxe, I seriously hope they get more than 10 Gold Tokens, as well have more Chance Cards, Community Chest cards for more various opportunities. And provide wide range of board or background customisation, to spice things up as well as Steam Achievements, Trading cards and top notch DLCs.			"

												While the game has a lot of flash and wow factor, what it doesn't have is much to offer in terms of gameplay.The A.I does offer a challenge, I do find trading is one of the more polished things of the game. The A.I doesn't just set values, it does negotiates and even cuts slack from time to time.But the game is far from polished. Unfortunately I have encountered bugs of one kind or another. one inparticular which destroyed the flow of the game is when the mouse cursor freezes while trying to roll the dice. It's endlessly frustrating to sit there at the start of my turn waiting for my mouse to unfreeze so I can take my turn. Unfortunately this bug alone is enough to stop me playing and quit to play something else.One of the biggest problems, and this is something I see meantioned over and over, is the games lack of multiplayer options. For a board game designed originally to be played entirely by people it seems odd that it only offers limited multiplayer from the same computer. Considering right now that free to play counterparts to monopoly already offer this feature on a truely massive scale, this is something the game severely lacks.In short if you are looking to buy this game to play with your friend, don't. You are far better off saving your money and buying the actual board game. There is no online play option and as far as game play goes this version of monopoly only really offers an A.I to play with. Really your just paying for animated pieces and some flashy screen splashes.			"

												This game is based on the XBOX 360 version of the game (Uses some kind of XNA developer code) The backgrounds are different however from this version. The graphics in the game are wonderful. The only complaint I have is that you have to move your taskbar in order to get to the options menu to make the game full screen on the first start. Small complaint yes. Oh and another one, I wish it was online so you can play against other people. But it's a vast improvement over the version that Tik Games had published. I did not particularly care for that one. Would also be great for kids in the family who want to play against each other on the same computer. I won't vote the game not reccomended just because it has no online multiplayer. Everyone has their gaming tastes and preferences.			"

												Even though I understand that games can't cheat, it feels like this game does that a lot in single player mode. I lost count on the amount of times I was sent to jail to avoid passing go as well as the amount of times the AI passed over areas that I developed. Regardless if the game is using algorithims tied to the dice to cheat or not, I believe that if you're going to play the game and spend potentially a few hours doing so, break out the physical board instead.

What is so hard about adding up all my total earnings from all my previous games?Other console versions do it.All and all, stay away. If they update this game, I will update my review.2/5..and thats just being generous.1 point for the actual game I could have played on a board,1 point for the 5 different settings** I could play in.edit; when i meant settings, i meant seperate rooms.Like the dining room, or living room..ect...there are 5 rooms where the table the board is sitting on can be located.

The game plays really nice and is set up really nice. The thing I hate is people say things like ""Well why not just go play the actual game if its hotseat"" Well my answer is because Monoply is so borning in rl having to count numbers do math run out of money, end up losing your tokens, cards, and money for the game. And deal with cheating while in vitural monoply its automatic its great! The bots play as well as actual players and playing on hard can be quite a challange while easy can be a nice laid back have fun type of mode. i recommend getting this game full price if you have the money but if your conservitive get it on sell cheap. That's just my opinion I love this game its great  and I reccomend to getting it regardless with no online multiplayer. my only complaint is no steam trading cards or achivements but that doesnt matter still a great game. Like I said a couple times already I reccomend getting it BUT the choice is yours in the end			"

												It's monopoly.If you like it, you buy it, it's good. That's all.My only complaint is that I'm from the UK, and we have different properties on our board. Which is cool, I'm glad they recognised this.But when you get chance cards or offers from other players, it shows their American counterparts, which makes the game really confusing.Luckily I know most of them.Apart from that, not bad. Could be better, could be much much worse.			"

												If you just have an itch to play the classic game of monopoly but no one will play with you this game is for you.  There is no online multiplayer but it does have local multiplayer.  It's good for someone like me who doesn't really care about online play for a game like this.  It also lets you play the game fast pace because you can quickly skip through the computers turns and then get back to making your moves.  No more waiting for that one pesky player that just wont go, and no worried about someone online going AFK for long periods of time.  If this sounds like something you would desire from a game this is a good pick (I travel a lot for work and it is a nice game to play when I am sitting on a cramped air plane, I have even played with other passangers I meet sitting next to me).  If this game sounds like you I would also recommend picking up the game of Risk on here as well, it is a very similar setup as this game. If you just want online play then your going to be disappointed and I would recommend avoiding this game.			"

												This release is a sad misguided production. Although it's accurate to the boardgame and works in the sence that you can win the game, it's impossible to follow what is going on. All through the game there are board movements and amounts coming up in the screen. In-game popups block the board partially and make it difficult to find the opponent pieces on the board. The settings don't let you change the unwanted visual effects. It does however let you change the colour of the dice. (?!?)I find myself going back to the event log to see what happened, who rolled the dice and why a certain amount flashed across the screen. Infogrames made a better version back in 1999. This version allowed a 2D-view of the board that allowed you to keep a good overview of the positions of the pieces, which is really helpful when making tactical decisions like when to invest in a monopoly.

												I actually really enjoyed this.  The presentation is colourful and helpful, the animation is good and you get a full set of options for trading and managing your properties.  Sure its just Monopoly, but its a respectful treatment of the board game.Negatives?  Well, no multiplayer - but then, would you really want to play multiplayer on a PC with a board game simulator?  It's never going to be Planetside 2, is it?  The only other downside is there are only two music tracks.  They're actually quite good in a cheesy kind of way, but I'd like many more given that the games can extend out to quite a long time.For seven quid its probably overpriced, but get it in a sale and its thoroughly recommended.

So I dont care if you buy it or not, its fun to me and more people who own it and like it! Also you MITE want to (if he gets it) buy his get out of jail card for free, so he can pay $50 or (not really) get doubles! He sells it (on easy I think or on all levels idk ive only played this game on easy) for $25 at the least. So be a nice guy and buy it from him so he can MAYBE (not much chance) get doubles or pay and lose $50! (You do not get it sorry XD.)			"

Very frustrating when it swaps to daft names for the streets (USA sorry guys) can't tell where I am supposed to be buying! :/ Again the play was annoying with the animation but then the veiw was too far back to see just looking at the board. I never knew where the other players where landing. Its an old fav. and no regrets of buying but would not of paid full price. Got it at 50% off in summer sale and for that price it was worth it but probably only because of nostalger. Glad you can turn off the auction option and option of free parking being on or off.			"

The only way you can play with another human is if you play in the same location on your PC. It's really stupid. The AI is extremely dumb; like Original Wolfenstein 3D AI Dumb. I don't think the AI could be programmed any worse if they tried. Playing the game on Hard is still playing the game on uber easy mode.			"

												n anything higher than easy or very easy, the computer cheats when it's 1 player against 3 ai's. The ai will also freely trade properties to try and get any of it's pieces a monopoly, and it will give you any roll that is needed to land on those specific properties while keeping it's precious pieces off of any monopoly you own. The piece(s) that has (have) the monopoly will commonly spend all it's (their) money to get a hotel, but that's fine because even on medium difficulty the ai pieces cannot be banrupted as long as there is only one human player unless it is to another ai piece. Maybe if you are going to have a friend or three over to your house, but only then. Oh, yeah, it is only local multiplayer, no online functions.			"

												You know its hard to NOT recommend Monopoly, which is such a great, and all time classic game.  But this computer game version of it is terrible.  There is nothing special about it at all, nothing to recommend on it.  The animations are terrible, its hard to see where your piece, and the other player's pieces are on the board, the camera does a follow on the dice as they bounce around the board when you roll that will make you nauseating sick, the music is horrifically awful, the GUI for your current assets leaves a lot to be desired....  need I go on?   Of those first 5 complaints, the only one you can fix, is the music.  The rest, you are stuck with.  The computer doesn't make intelligent trades; its a hard♥♥♥♥♥for 7 trades in a row, offering exactly what you paid for an item, so that it completes its set.  I reject each one and a few turns later, it offers $900 for mortgaged New York Ave, when it only has $920.  Also a glitch the first time I was in jail, I had my get out of Free Jail card.  Couldn't find it, cause I cant see my stuff, especially that.  Got no offer to use it.  And I was broke, so I really could have used it.  Instead had to mortgage stuff to get out.  Next time I was in jail, it immediately popped up asking if I wanted to use it.  Well I know I didn't somehow miss the giant full screen message the first time.Long story short, for $4.00,  this was a total waste of money, but thankfully not a lot of money, and I'll probably never play it again.

												So I got all four board games made by this developer, decided to playtest each of them.I was expecting a horrid, boring and tiresome game after reading the below reviews.  Nothing but negative, negative, negative.  even so, I was still lacking a PC port of my all time favorite game, so I bought into it anyway.  Surprisingly, I wasn't disapointed.  I wasn't scratching my head at the UI trying to figure it out, I wasn't holding my ears shut from some horrible music theme, I wasn't slamming my head into my desk at the consistant crashes, none of it.Instead, I was quite pleased at the little game.  It's nice, easy to work, has low system requirements, doesn't seem at all buggy, and it's just the same as I've always remembered it.  You can change the background for atmospheric effects, set your own house rules, and play with up to 4 players, all AI or human.I suppose one thing people are mad at is no online multiplayer, it's hot-seat only, witch is rather disapointing.  Of course, I never really play multiplayer online anyway, so it's not an issue for me.Overall though, I'd say it's worth the buy if you're in need of a PC Monopoly port.  It's simple, low requirements, small, practically plug-and-play, and has enough that'll keep me coming back for a long time.  If I find any issues with it, I'll be sure to edit them in this review once I get a tad bit more time put into it.			"

												This is the second Hasbro game on sale this week that blows.I've not played on anything else other than difficulty level hard, and from what I can tell, the game becomes harder only in that the other AIs cooperate in trading.  I just had two AI trade Connecticut Ave (giving the other the monopoly) for States Ave (no opportunity to build) one-for-one.  Nothing to sweeten the deal, just an even trade.Had the same thing happen in a previous game when AI traded Boardwalk for Marvin Gardens + $2.  Gave both the chance to build.  WTF?With the cards, AI-drawn cards generally earn them money or properties, while player-drawn cards seem to cost money every time. Best advice is to get a minimum of one of each color early.  When someone owns ONE of a color you don't, trade for money and keep it. if they get two, they'll never give you one for anything other than a rediculous amount of cash, or  something on which they can build. Otherwise the AI will trade-f#ck you.The only thing religious on Christmas in my family is our love of Monopoly with NO house rules, and the crap I'm seeing with the AI here is so absurd, even the worst players in real life wouldn't do.  I'm no sore loser, but it takes the fun out of it completely.			"

												This is how the game works... right off the bat, the games A.I. decides what player or computer opponent it wants to win. It chooses randomly, so it could be you at times. It also chooses one out of the four players/A.I. which will have the worst of luck and will ♥♥♥♥ you with no lube. In-fact, if you're on the receiving end, it'll probably stick it's hand up your♥♥♥♥♥and use you as a hand puppet. This game was not worth the money. The A.I. is completely stupid. It would literally buy a piece of property and then sell you that same property at a discounted rate.			"

												There are better free versions available online.  Increasing difficulty results in cheated dice rolls, and trades that only serve to hinder the human player. Too many times have absurd trades been made between AI opponents that serve no purpose other than to make the game ""difficult"". I understand that HARD should be just that, but it should remain at least reasonable. The camera angles are weird. It should support up to at least 6 computer players. The interface is clunky. The graphics and animation are fine, music is not annoying, and house rules are interesting but unnecessary. As someone else pointed out, Chance and Community Chest cards are not put into a discard pile but instant recycled leading to mupltiple draws of the same card back to back quite frequently (which should almost never happen). All in all, sub-par verison of this game.			"

												I love Monopoly. Despite the game's flaws, it is genuinely one of my favorite board games. Unfortunately, this particular version of it is rather poor.  It maxes out at the weird resolution of 1680 x 1050. What kind of resolution is that? Do they even sell monitors in that size? Why would a game released in 2012 not allow you to have regular 1080p? Also, the sound effects cut out after a single turn, leaving you with just the music. Also, you can only have four players, while the board game, and numerous other computer editions allow for six. The presentation is bare-bones and the environments are mostly pretty ugly.If you want a truly great version of Monopoly for PC, go on Ebay or Amazon and track down the version from 2000 by Hasbro Interactive. That game has:* Support for 6 players* Fun Voice-overs* Cool animations* Good looking art style, despite the game's age* Custom Board Designer* A catchy theme song* Feels more alive in generalA new company recently appeared and seems to be doing new versions of Hasbro board games that had previous versions on Steam. Hopefully they'll reach Monopoly, because the PC deserves a good, Modern Monopoly game.			"

												The game seems a little rushed and could potentialy have more features added to the game, differant boards, more scenery and differant dice that sorta thing..The dice rolls favours the AI.. I can comfirm this.. It was me vs boat AI and I owned nearly all the board with hotels and the AI manged to go around the board 11 times with out landing on any of my properties.. This lasted for nearly half an hour. In the end I won but annoyed at the same-time..The difficulty setting only seems to make the game harder by screwing your dice rolls over.. The chance cards seem to favour AI more than it does favouring you.. Ive havnt had that many cards thats given me nice stuff for all the 8.9 hours I spent on it.. The only thing I use this game for is when my friends say il be on later.. Thats it...I didnt realise at first it was part of E.A.. If I known I wouldnt have annitialy have bought it.. But I couldnt be bothered in getting a refund.. Im gunna play it till I get my moneys worth outa it then its gunna sit in my libary gathering dust..In conclusion: the game is so/so.. Since im giving it a rating below 5 then it gets a thumbs down from me..			"

												Hi All,Well what can I say its monopoly. Good graphics and pleasant animations. My main gripe is the sound.  Its not bad its just very loud in places; when you start a new game there is a reallay stupid, really loud noise.Anyway the game is good and fun to play.  Good against AI players with the levels of play ok.  Although the easy is too easy and the hard is pretty much impossible.I feel that there are too many animations in the game and sometimes it can take an age between goes but all in all its a good version of a classic game.  I got it cheap in the last steam sale but even at regular price of £6.99 is still worth it.Come on lets play Monopoly.....  "

												This game brings back memories from my childhood. I used to play Monopoly the board game, although I did love the anticipation of what propety I'd get first. Personally, I'd go for the railroads and companies, then buy at least one of every property so my opponent wouldn't get the upperhand. Although I've only had nearly 10 hours so far, it brings back memories and allows me to relive my childhood every time I play. This game is worth the money, and even more so on sale!			"

												The game mechanics and graphics are fine (probably better than most previous Monopoly incantations I've seen) but the AI is terrible.  It's not that the AI is particularly difficult, it's just that it makes so many stupid decisions.  For instance I've regularly seen one AI trade another AI two high monopolies for a single low monopoly.  The AIs are so poor that the game is effectively unplayable.  Don't waste your money unless you are truly desparate to play monopoly.			"

												Classic Monopoly with cute graphics. I admit it's lazy on my part but I prefer the compter version because my friends and I tend to simplify the math by rounding and it gets a little crazy after a while. This has the added benefit of allowing you to have AI players along with your friends so you can gang up on the AI and work together rather than against each other. The dice mechanics are neat as well as the ""roll for me"" option. I also love that you can allow cheating in the game. (You can choose 1 dice roll and pay half of rent once in the game if you allow cheating.) Overall a great game for solo play or with friends.			"

												This is quite good.  It is an offical Hasbro product.I fail to see why it is not worth the asking price - it is possibly quite cheap, especially if you just want to play single-player against the AI.The game keeps stats on certain things - nothing spectacular.There are full instructions and tips built-in.There is a Teaching mode - tutorial.You can play with up to 4 players (including yourself) - including up to 3 AI players.Difficulty settings are Very Easy, Easy, Medium and Hard - so this affects ALL of the AI players.There is an option to use 'Sleight of Hand':  If Sleight of Hand is turned on then each human player will be able to use 3 special Sleight of Hand abilities once per game.  I have yet to test this, but it is probably something like re-rolling the dice.There are 3D environments: dining table, 3 lounges and a sort of space-age one. Oddly, the Steam Store screenshots show a United States monopoly board - I am in the UK, but wasn't bothered - but the game turned out to have a UK board - so it might recognise your country.However, the Chance/Community Chest cards all refer to the US properties - PLUS, the AI deals in the US properties.You can set House Rules for your game (Houses per Hotel, House/Hotel Limit, Initial starting cash, amount received when passing Go, etc.).Available player tokens are: dog, iron, shoe, top hat, battleship, thimble, wheelbarrow and race car.  Player colours are blue, yellow, pink and red.It is not a major problem - as when trading is going on, you can see a plan-view of the board, so it is pretty clear what is being traded.  However, for clarity, I would probably rather just opt to play with the US game board; however, there is no option to do that.You can turn animations off; however, it is easier to keep track of events by leaving animations on - as pieces will instantly move and the AI players will all just move in a second and leave you wondering what happened.I think the graphics are okay - certainly not poor - it plays in various window modes or full-screen.During play, you can view a FULL log of events  at any point - ie:Battleship gets to go first;Battleship is starting its turn;Battleship rolled 9;Battleship bought Connecticut Avenue for M120 - ie Pentonville Road on UK board;Top Hat is starting its turn;etc;You can manage properties (build/view/mortgage, etc) and also trade with other players.You can also save games.

												Not sure why people are harping on the difficulty. Medium was easy enough. Hard was noticeably more difficult, but not in a bad way. Played it twice, lost once and won once. The AI players tend to trade with themselves more to quickly build up monopolies, which just means the human player needs to be more aggresive. The hard one I won still took awhile and didn't seem certain even though I had built up a lot of properties. But yeah, if you play medium or easy you are just gonna win all of the time.			"

I enjoy the game. I recommend the game, but would also recommend an online multiplayer DLC. Also just for disclaimer I got it at half price.			"

												I always thought Monopoly would be hard to mess up. It's an old game that's been immortalized on many consoles. I remember my Sega Genesis version had AI players with portraits, animations, and sure there was no online multiplayer, but if you gave your sister the weird off-brand controller, BOOM. Two players.This version can't even get that right. And in a stunning divergence from the Sega Monopoly, it decided not to load certain textures. Like the texture for the freaking dice. And if you thought that you'd get some decent local multiplayer, you thought wrong. Even though local multiplayer is literally the point of Monopoly, there's no support for controllers. Which means that you're passing the keyboard back and forth.Other than a desperate money grab, why bother? It plays like some kid's final project for their CS class. Admirable, not not what I'd call ready for production.			"
