												Pros - One of the few tanks sims that exists. Limited but fairly accurate and enjoyable, with high degree of customizability for realism settings. Includes mission/map/object editor. Co-op multiplayer allows up to 3 people to command a single tank.Cons - Confusing and likely not enjoyable for anyone who doesn't like simulators or has no clue about tanks/armored warfare. General clunkiness and quite dated. Good luck finding any user maps.There is a demo for this game, if you're on the fence track down a copy and give it a try.It's one of the few tank sims that actually exists so it doesn't have much to be compared to. It's reasonably accurate and entertaining but is extremely clunky and poorly programmed, going by how many loading screens you'll go through switching from menu to menu. Customizing individual graphical/realism options (other than putting it to low/medium/high/etc.) requires you to close the game and run a cfg.bat in the game directory.Despite being old and with a questionable build quality I haven't had any mysterious crashes or other game breaking bugs or issues despite running it on windows 7 64 bit, which actually makes it more stable than other current titles I play. The only glaring bug I've found is that you cannot reload the coaxial machinegun at all, the only workaround being enabling infinite ammunition which also gives you infinite shells for your main weapon.It's also quite challenging, and it's not helped by the default user settings having the enemy AI at quite a high level. You can't rely on your armor in the first few missions and will frequently have to restart due to your crew bailing out after a single hit. The AI will also spot you much earlier than your AI commander will be able to spot them. Thankfully there are a lot of options for realism settings and you can pick and choose until you end up with something you're comfortable with.The manual has plenty of information but is missing one or two details like the penetration of munitions used in game, and it was probably also in color at one point and has not survived the shift to black and white.There's nothing here for anyone who does not enjoy simulators, as while it is fairly streamlined compared to what it could be it still is a sim. It is only 5 dollars and there is not exactly a glut of other simulators to choose from. Find a copy of the demo if you're on the fence about it.			"

												Okay, I decied to write a short review on this game.Currently the game is only 1,24 Euro, and after a few days the game goes back to its original 5 E.I'm writing this down because the price is definitely a big plus. As of the game itself, you will probably like it if you're into tanks and/or simulators. I am. Overall, I am quite pleased with the game. However, this is heavily influenced by its price. For 1,2 Euro, it's a great deal. For 5 Euro, I'm not really sure. You decide.Pros:+Terrain can be deformed (craters after explosions, you can dig tank trenches [UBER COOL] etc)+Ability to demolish buildings is interesting, reminds me of Frostbite :D+Spectator mode allows you to see where exactly did the shells hit the tank, which is both interesting and useful.+I like the thermal/nightvision scope :3+Rather easy to learn+Ability to issue orders to other squads/tanks (though clunky)+DAT PRICECons:-Uninteresting mission design (go over there, kill a tank on the way, you win)-Only three (playable) tanks-No tank interior, only HUD-Bad functionality.. (the game menu and the game itself are separate programs, there are some issues with settings etc)-Does not support Steam Overlay (that is to be expected I guess)-MULTIPLAYER NOT WORKING!! (if anyone got it to work, PM me please)-Not too interesting, yet definitely original setting-I feel as if the controls are a bit clunky... Maybe you get used to it as time passes.-Physics seem broken if you happen to glitch it-Not too many missions (you can download some from the internet)-Translation from Russian is funny - why is there ""Made in USSR"" written on the speedometer? Also, the azbuka  abbreviations to English is weird. Manual covers the explanations though.Overall, the game feels like a low-budget title of some minor Russian developer, but it can be clearly seen they did their best. I'm not sure whether I can call this game a real ""simulator"". It's more of a really realistic tank game (which is maybe even better for me, since you learn the ropes faster, yet it keeps the satisfaction from realistic experience). So, yeah. You decide. I don't regret getting this.			"

												Do you like tanks and willing spend time learned about them?  Do you want to experience driving Russian tanks?  Buy this gameDo you prefer simple fps like Call of Duty or Battlefield?  Do you enjoy shiny new graphics and pretty gimmicks? Don’t buy it.Seriously, this game is not for amateurs.  Your shells will not magically land right on the center of your cross hair.  You will have to change gear while driving.  You will have to learn how to use your sights.  You will have to restart the entire mission if you drive too fast and broke your tracks.   "

												Pretty fun game. Probably doesn't qualify as a ""simulation"", but there are very few tank sims available nowadays for $8. Good graphics, enjoyable game play, and good replay value. Pretty hard to top that unless you want to spend a LOT more cash. Best to print out the commands on a sheet of paper and have it laminated. You will need them and be consulting them often.			"

												The negative reviews are mainly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t save for a few, the only major problem with this is that it comes with a few compatibility issues (so far only on windows 10, which seems to be the case for most games anyways.), i've gotten it working just fine on windows 7 and windows 8.1.This game feels great (at least once you've actually bothered to read the manual and learn the controls), the combat + squad commanding is great, and so far I haven't run into any real bugs. (again for win 7 & 8.1)There's a great variety in the missions and an ok selection of tanks that you can operate. (T-34, T-55 and T-72 of course)You can expand this even more though thanks to the modding community that this game has built up.I'd definitely recommend this for people that are heavily into military/vehicle sims or just really want to learn a thing or two about tanks.

												MOVE TO WAYPOINTNO RUSH WE GOT ENOUGH TIMEIn all seriousness, if there was an option between ""postitive"" and ""negative"" i'd rate this game that.T-72 tank command is a tank simulator featuring 3 tanks, T-34-85, T-55 and T-72B, sounds attractive right? The game has very poor control even for a sim and is of poor graphics even for its time.On the postitive side I'd give praise for its fire control simulation of the tanks and controls.I do not recommend this game for the regular tank gamers honestly, but if you have lots of time to learn the control and REALLY into tanks, then sure.After all it's cheap and just adds to another game collection, so it doesn't hurt too much to try it.

												Alright so.This is one of those games that's fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥to play if you like breaking games, because it's fairly easy for this one.Essentially it's a Kebab Remover simulator where you play as a Russian volunteer in a tank crew for the Yugoslav/Serbian Army, and for the most part fight the Croats.If you drive your T-55 at max speed into an APC, you will begin to gravitate or fly into the air. It's also REALLY easy to flip your tank. Hilarity ensues if you play this with friends.If you want a serious tank sim with decent gameplay, which is what I had in mind when buying this, look elsewhere.			"

												Its a very good tank sim. Its nothing like a game like World of Tanks(if you ever have played it). This game can have a very realistic tone to it, ranging from Anti-tank missiles that kill you in one hit, to damaged system on the tank, even the engine start and usage of weapon systems. This game is far from the realism of Steel Beasts, but is a 5 dollar game that is worth the buy. (Its only 5 bucks!)			"

												This is simply an unbeatable simulation FOR THE PRICE.I am not an expert, and I suspect the physics model doesn't hold up when compared to higher grade sims, but it is enjoyable nonetheless. An additional plus is the single vehicle co-op, which I have been a huge sucker for ever since playing Necrodome in the early 2000's.It is not without its flaws however. The locked resolution and FOV are particularly grating if you have a widescreen monitor. Edit: the resolution can be changed from the cfg.bat file in the game's folder.In conclusion: pick it up on sale.			"

												I can't see the bottom of the screen, but the rest of the game is good. I've managed to get to the ""choose a training mission"" menu. The buttons are of a green, soothing colour against a dark grey background. The menu music is heroic, but poorly composed IMHO. The rotating gear beneath the stopped watch chronometer creates a feeling of dynamically developing diplomatic events against the backdrop of war and local conflict. Very deep symbolism indeed.---Перевод: Ни ♥♥♥♥♥♥ не работает дальше меньшек. Низ экрана не видно - начать миссию нельзя. Меньшюки крутые - почти как на пиратском DVD начала 2000х. Ностальгия.			"

												An amzing game, you start out in a t-34 russian tank which is made out of rusty forks and a dead cat and is fueled by vodka and a severe hatred towards capitalism. Then you get the joy of driving arcross an amazing landscape with stunning unique features such as trees, rocks, and grass. After that you get a taste of the action by shooting a bunch of angry dirt farmers who are armed with some never seen before rolling techinques which can evade high explosive tank rounds and machine gun fire. Then you get to engage in tank to tank combat, in which you battle it out against a tank crew with the skills of Helen keller. As you progress you get the opportunity to command soldiers that you found at the resource center and tanks that have stage freight. 10/10 would shoot rolling dirt farmers again.			"

Other people have the same problem with no apparent solution.English and EspañolOne of the few tank games in steam, is not perfect but is better than  nothing.There are 18 missions with T-34-85, T-55 and T-72 tanks, you can adjust the difficulty and realism with the cfg file. I recommend to read the manual.De los pocos juegos de tanques que hay en steam, no es perfecto pero algo es algo.El juego consta de 18 misiones, usando tanques T-34-85, T-55, y T-72, puedes configurar la dificultad y el realismo en el archivo cfg, lo cual recomiendo pues este juego es dificil, ya que requeriria de multiples personas para jugarlo cada una en una posición diferente dentro del tanque ademas de que creo que la estadimetria no esta bien explicada.Recomiendo revisar los controles dentro del juego pues son mas claros que en el manual.

												This game has potentioal but needs work! The AI driver hasnt got a clue what hes doing, seems to alwasy turn around and drive backwards with no way to direct him, there is no description of which ammo is which and the gunnery tutorial is very very poor (ranging anyone?) and there are alot of bugs (drive up to ambush point and nothing happens).

												This game looked interesting to me at first and it was only 74 cents so i figured why not pick it up and give it a go. The first time I booted up the game I tried to skip the introduction, and immedately the entire game crashed. So I relaunched, still couldnt skip intro. So i waited the 2 minutes for the intros to be finished and then proceded to look for a tutorial. I could find no such thing. I later discovered that the game comes with a manual that you have to boot up independently. But not knowing this I figured I might just go ahead and give a level a shot. So I selected a level and clicked start and the game crashed. So I tried again and it loaded up. To put it simply it took me 5 minutes to figure out which position I could drive from and then another 5 to figure out how to go forward. The commands are not exactly user friendly and are not at all where you would expect commands to be. After much trial and error I managed to learn how to drive my tank. It took me an equal if not longer amount of time to figure out how to shoot the gun. And when i finaly did shoot the gun the game crashed.Long story short if i had a second chance I would not have purchased this game.			"
