												A very fun turn-based game. It's a simple enough story, blue against red, no real bioware-like writing, but the game is a lot of turn-based, unit building fun so if you like that, that's great. Unfortunatly, after a while it does get a little old, especially with no actual storyline or anything else to keep you invested and it goes on for 50 missions which may not seem much, but being a turn-based game it takes soooo long.

												A cute lil no brainer to relax with. A great game to introduce a kid to the turn based strategy genre. My  7 year old son loves it. This game is a great way to spend some quality time with your child and get some chuckles while doing it. The multi-player system IS dated, you send data packets back and forth to each other via a lobby chat room type thing ... you take a turn, upload your turn to the server, the opponent Downloads your turn, takes his own turn and uploads it back and this continues until the game is over ..... it doesnt take long to take the turns and it isnt that bad once you get used to it. This harkens back to the early days of Multi-player over the internet and a game called ""Empire"" on the Amiga 500 where you did this exact thing ... take a turn ... upload it (or save it to a floppy disk back then) or e-mail the turn to a friend ..... not sure why they did it this way other than lazy programming or a lack of knowledge on the Devs part as to modern day programming techniques but it is what it is. I still think it is a great way to introduce kids to the TBS genre and my son and I love it.			"

												 While on the surface this game may appear simple, the way it uses it's rock-paper-scissor mechanic adds so much to it's depth and competitive strategy. The game has many many skirmish maps as well as a long story-based camaign.The skirmish maps are balanced, whereas the campaign puts you in various positions that you have to work your way out of as well as easing you into the game so you can learn the units a few at a time. There are a good variety of units, each with different strengths and weaknesses, to be used in different situations. Grunts, the standard infantry, are relatively cheap at $75. But should they come up agains a Sniper ($200) which has superior range, they can be one-shotted. Sending a Scout Tank ($100) could have the speed to get close enough to take out the Sniper, unless there's a Bazooka ($100) nearby, which could one-shot the Scout Tank.There's such a complexity between all the units, divided into land, sea, and air; I could go on forever. Worth the $10.			"

												I picked this up because it was cheap and looked like I could waste a few minutes on it here and there.  I was wrong.  I've had it maybe a day and I've got 10 hours into it already.  Not a bad little strategy title with a bit of humour thrown in - although some animations could be faster and the turn change animation is annoying after the first few times you see it.  I'm really tired of the vehicles zooming across the screen now.  But I'm being picky.  This game does take a bit of strategy, but it's not all that complex and the campaign really eases you into the game with a new units being introduced at a pace that makes it easy to learn how to use them properly.  Units level if you keep them alive long enough - but it seems they only level after a number of kills so spread the kills around if you can, and keep those old units alive.Overall - 7.5/10 - and it would score higher if I was not so irritated by little things - like the zooming vehicle turn transitions.

												Ignore the snarky reviews of this game. If like me you've been waiting for a game that's like XCOM for years, then look no further. The game plays like a mixture between Command and Conquer and XCOM, with a busty woman and an insane General to spice things up. Is it graphically impressive? No. Does it matter? No. It was never meant to be like stepping into the computer room in Minority Report. It's a hex tile tactical game with cartoony graphics and cheerful little soldiers who, if they're not lollygaggin', they're out seeing Uncle Jasper. I loved it and wish they'd make another.			"

												After years of playing Advance Wars in an emulator I wanted better. Tried the demo of the small wars game and then found this. Love the sarcasm and humor in the game. The only short comings for me are the aircraft are kind of a PITA to use and I wish there were some bigger maps! I'd like a skirmish to last an hour not 15 minutes. Other than that, lovin it.			"

												Probably one of the most casual games I have ever played. Only recommended if you are buying it for small children. The game features turn based combat on a hex tiled board and different units with obvious strengths and weaknesses. In fact the rock paper scissors style combat system is so biased that a severly weakened unit can still easily kill a full health unit that it counters. Battles are boring and just lead to unit spamming more than actual strategy. Also the unit speech is probably the cringiest stuff i have EVER heard.			"

												turn based strategy game.very basic graphics and sounds, annoying and repetitive npc commentaries and music.the game was developed for android / ios.  maybe its fun to play on a tablet,  but its sure an insult for your hardware if you play it on a pc.anything positive? oh yeah: cross platform multiplayer!(implying that there is anyone playing it...)my conclusion:instead of wasting 10 bucks for this, better buy the 5 cheapest games on steam and i swear, all of them will be better than the ""GREAT big war game"".

												A very well made game that may be perhaps the only functioning Advance Wars game of this generation. There have been multiple clones of Advance wars, none as successful as this one though this one isn't technically a clone of it. Still it's a fun turn based strategy game with one simple goal: Kill 'em all. And have fun while doing so. Just listen to what the little soldiers are saying as they run around the map. They also have very hillarious scientific Latin names in their own selection boxes. An enjoyable game till the next one comes out and then that one will hopefully be even better than this one. 10/10 would play exact same game with a different title again and again.			"
