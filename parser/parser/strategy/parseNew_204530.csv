												EDIT:  Note that I do not own and have not played the DLC for this game: the Trickster's Arsenal.  As such, I cannot comment on the quality of the DLC, only on the base game.  This might be important, since the DLC is active for all players, even those who don't own it, in the leaderboard modes.  I may or may not adjust this review in the future, if I re-download the game.Original review follows:-----I liked infested planet.  I bought the game on a bit of a whim when it was on sale, and it had been sitting in my gift inventory.  All I really knew about it was that you ordered people around and they shot aliens.  Which sounds like a hell of a lot of fun, really.And it is.The basic premise of the levels is that you start with a single capture point, and you must destroy the alien hives which sit atop their own capture points, until you control the map.  With each point you capture you get more resources (called Build Points) and the alien army 'mutates' and creates an additional complication that you must overcome.The game plays at a great pace.  It's always tense, and yet, when you take a step back, the gameplay actually evolves slowly.  You'll often find yourself wondering if you really need to drop a turret to cover an alien attack, or if you could just spare a single marine and spend the resources for the turret elsewhere, and all the while the lines of battle are being pushed and pulled.  It's a great feeling.And those choices.  Those options!  There are so many different things you can do.  There are three main 'classes' of upgrades you can spend points on: weapons for your soldiers, localised power buildings like turrets or healing crates, or global upgrades that can do all manner of things from giving your soldiers grenades to having reinforcements dropped in by helicopter mid-fight.  The best thing of all?  They're practically all valid courses of play.  Everything feels balanced and nice.I mean look; there's a building that summons robotic clones of your soldiers when they die that fight on for a while.  This means that yes: suicide missions are possible.  And sometimes they are even optimum.  If you -need- to capture that next point before the next attack wave comes in, and you don't have enough points for something to siege with, then an all out infantry rush might just do the trick.Then there's the opponent.  The alien swarm controlled by the AI.  Here's another thing that's been done really well.  While I was playing I got the distinct impression that behind the alien swarm was another player.  Or at least another thing playing its own game.  It had different rules to me, but it had to abide by them nonetheless.  Each mutation the aliens choose have a profound impact on your play and options.  You might be happily shotgunning the swarm one moment, but with the next capture suddenly the alien has consolidated its power into pseudo-human guardians, and you need to swap out your cheep shotguns for expensive sniper rifles.  At higher difficulties the AI even counter-picks you.  For example, if you invest in a lot of personnel upgrades, the aliens will send clones of them.  I hope you know how to deal with the very same minigunners that you had waltzing right back towards your bunkers!The game doesn't look the prettiest, and the sounds are okay, but what it does well is the gameplay, and it does that amazingly.So now we have to ask.  Do I think this is worth 15$?  For myself?  Surely.  For anyone on the fence, I can say with certainty that it is worth your time and your money.			"

												Where on earth do I begin with this one. Right. Okay, what is it? It's not a traditional strategy game in the usual senses of the word. It's not an RTS in so much as that the forces are hideously asymetric, and it's not Turn Based either. I would call this a ""Swarm control"" game, where the concept is that you have a small number of deployable troops, as well as static defences, and from this you have to construct a working strategy that funnels a much larger force into killzones and crossfires. Combat works on scales that you don't generally get to think about in such games, your 4-7 little poxy marines will end up riddling thousands, yes, thousands of enemy aliens with holes over the space of one mission, and quickly you stop viewing the enemy as a mass of individuals, but as mentioned - a swarm, one to be controlled, funnelled, and pushed back.When you finally ""click"" with the concept, and you start figuring out how to approach the swarms and manage them, the game suddenly starts falling into place, systems and mechanics which were until then entirely unmanagable become second nature and intuitive, and you quickly fall into the habit of securing outposts, setting up turret crossfires, assessing where you can do the most damage, how to maximise your soldiers efficiency. You stop thinking in individual terms and if anything, approach the mission almost in a ""grand strategy"" way of things. That's the beauty of infested planet.Graphics and sound are decent, it's an indie effort, and the graphics achieve what they set out to do (you won't get confused and lose track of what's going on, be thankful), ditto for the sound, the plot too, again, servicable, but the gameplay clicks, it takes a while to get over the learning curve, because the game is so radically different from what most people will be used to, but the investment eventually does pay off. The experience is very much unlike anything else around, and is definitely worth checking out if you fancy a change of pace from normal RTS experiences.			"

												I've been playing games for 30 years now.This is easily in my Top Five of games spanning those years. No question.Extremely tactical (work up to the hardest battles with the most unforgiving mutations and you'll need tactics just to hold ground let alone advance...).Zoom in close or out to the full battlefield.Don't be afraid to experiment!!! Reach for those skills you've never tried. Mix and match different units and abilities, everything is potentially useful or even necessary to win.True tactical genius. Please buy so the dev (who is always floating around on the forums answering questions) can feed his family (cats or human) and hopefully keep making games.P.S. My first review ever! After 30 years!RegardsSlinky "

												A simple, challenging game. I have some stability issues, it tends to crash after a few hours, but other than that it's great. I keep coming back to it because it's a good choice to waste 30 minutes of time, and it's so simple that you dont have to spend any time relearning the game. As others have noted, the random nature of the levels and enemy upgrades can sometimes make a particular level nearly impossible to complete, but if you surrender you get to keep all the single-mission upgrades you purchased, and you get cash for all the swarm you have killed so far, so when you try again you are in a better position to win.

												Hands down, this is one of the best RTS games I've ever played. What makes it different from the rest of the genre? Well, for every alien base you capture, you get points that can be spent on units and buldings - but you can also sell what you have and re-distribute your points when needed (units respawn after a little while when they die).This makes for very interesting and rewarding gameplay, as you don't have to start over from scratch when they start to defeat you. Simply fall back, rethink your strategy and redistribute your points if necessary. You can also browse the map and give commands while the game is paused, removing the need for super-reflexes and making it easier to deploy your tactics, however detailed they might be. The graphics and explosions are also very satisfying - you really feel you crush these nasty critters :)All in all, a very rewarding game that doesn't require full-time dedication to get into, while continuing to provide an enjoyable experience even after the 100th game. I find myself going back to this once in a while for a game or two.This game is a hidden gem; way better than Starcraft 2.			"

												Infested Planet is a top-down swarm management RTS developed by Rocket Bear Games. In Infested Planet you take command of a team of five elite soldiers waging war against an alien race which constantly adapts to its situation. Over the course of the campaign you must learn more about this alien race you fight in order to be more effective against it, along the way both sides of the fight receive upgrades and new toys to play with and you must adapt to accomodate these changes. +Cool art style and good graphics+Mostly well designed, your units, buildings, enemies etc. all look cool+A few different soldier classes to be unlocked and used, each with strengths and weaknesses+Several different types of enemies+Simple yet fun gameplay which consists of just telling your units where to go. However this can at times get very repetitive, especially on longer missions+A lot of new technologies and upgrades to be unlocked in the in-game shop+A lot of missions in the campaign mode, many of which are randomly generated+If you recycle a unit you get everything you spent on it back+Enemy AI is very unpredictable which makes the game more challenging+You can customise Skirmish maps+Most missions allow you to approach your objectives in a way which suits your own playstyle+Pretty interesting story+Good sound effects-Very steep difficulty curve, the first few story missions are easy but after that they get significantly harder, it would benefit from easing you into it a little bit more. You very quickly get swamped with enemies from everywhere, it becomes hard to go on the offense as well as defend what you've already taken-As mentioned earlier the gameplay does get a bit repetitive-Level environments are pretty dull and there's little variation between levels in the same location-Apart from a couple of exceptions the missions all are pretty much just split into two types of mission, capture everything in your own time or capture everything withing a specific timeVerdict:7.5A fun top down RTS game with a cool art style, good variety of soldier classes, several different enemies to fight and lots of unlocks.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.

												Infested Planet is a mix between StarCraft and Starship Troopers.I will start with the negative points first:The difficulty can be quite extreme in the later levels. Despite a very flexible gameplay system and some good level ideas or even some maps that are randomly generated, overall the game can end up feeling repetitive if played in long sessions. The art style goes from excellent to just ok.Now for the rest. Infested Planet plays like a tactical game, or a light RTS (Real-time Strategy). The base construction is minimal, as there is no resource harvesting and there are no factories. The buildings just provide defense or a specific bonus. They are definitively not at the center of the game.However the distribution of the bases are an important factor of the game. Each base is actually a capture point that can belong to either the player or the Aliens according to who takes it. In general, the player starts with one point and will have to battle through the map and capture each point.Each Alien base produces a continuous swarm of creatures that attack the player's positions (and despite some minor pathfinding issues, the AI is not stupid and can change course to attack undefended point). The player then has to manage the defense against the flow of Aliens, and the offense to capture points. Capturing a point has two effects that allow the game its sense of progression: some building points are awarded to the player in order to upgrade their army, and the Aliens benefit from a new mutation (new enemy type, new defenses, new hives) that increases the difficulty. Towards the end of the map, the Aliens are very powerful but the player has a wide range of options to deal with them and adapt to the mutation.Adaptation is an important word to describe this game. First, because there are a lot of options available to the player. Different kind of weapons for the Marines to equip (Minigun, Flamethrower), or different buildings (turrets, airstrike, bonuses for the Marines or buildings). And even if it is more gamey than realistic, at any given point it is possible to remove one of these options to retrieve back all the building points that it costs and change strategy on the fly. This is really GREAT and it allows to experiment without being stuck in a specific technological branch, and to react better to situations (however, some bonuses feel lackluster in comparison to others and thus the cost of entry is not worth investing). Since I am praising this gameplay idea, I also think that the UI (User Interface) and gameplay and level design are all based on the RTS formula but with some nice and subtle improvement touches. An example would be the dreaded escort mission that plagues most RTS games. Except that here, if the escort dies, it just respawns and tries again. Thus the escort feels like an additional firepower help until the map is safe enough to navigate it, instead of being a burden!What I like with this game is its adaptability, its polished touches that are delightful surprises, and its sense of progression and pace. Every little step won or lost to the Alien swarms can be felt by the player, and there are very tense moments. And then the overwhelming scary swarm can suddenly be overturned into a jubilating victory, until a new mutation tips the balance of power.Really a unique and interesting game that shows that RTS games can offer more than we think if they are well thought-of and if the developers are not afraid to make changes in the classic formula.

												At first glance it would be easy to think this game doesn't look like much or have much too offer....but you would be wrong.The premise is simple.  Surive and elimante the alien horde by taking over thier bases.  Sounds easy...it's not and I've spent hours on some levels trying to find that magical combination of marine upgrades and building tech to tip the balance.  And when you do finally succeed it is very satisfing.Each raid, capture or skirmish level is generated every time you play and offer a challenge to find a way to succeed.This game is worh the money.

												Regularly expanding via patches, Infested Planet provides a solid gameplay experience with enough variety to keep you coming back for more. A fine balance between powerful upgrades and being hopelessly outnumbered allows for a fun mixture of a power trip with a slap in the face of miserable failure.If you're like me, you find much enjoyment out of games that bring that feeling.Highly recommended for fans of Tower Defense, Squad Based, and Tactical games.

												I really should play this more often. Nothing quite like battling against swarms of alien bugs with increasingly murderous weaponry. The at times seemingly unstoppable swarms- depending on which mutations the enemy happens upon- provides very tense gameplay requiring quick decisive movements lest you be fought to a standstill and trust me, you want to be on the defensive for as little time as possible. Alien mutations will punish slow playstyles. This fine balance between hold and push has the momentum shifting constantly particularly at the higher levels/difficulties.  The fast paced gameplay coupled with charming visuals means Infested Planet is a great strategy game for those looking for that quick adrenaline fix.			"

Since the game and dlc pack was so cheap I went ahead and bought the game with the dlc it provided. I have to say that this game is worth it. This is my first review here on steam and it's because this game deserves it, it deserves to be prasied because of the awesome gameplay, it's simple yet amazing visuals. This game just blows my mind. I can't get enough of it. I highly recommend that people buy it. If you're reading this review just stop and buy the game because trust me it is worth every penny.			"

												Infested Planet is a hectic horde RTS title that matches a handful of marines with thousands of bugs and mutated nasties, overwhelming battles will remind you of Starship Troopers' scenes where death and retreat are inescapable. All missions start with one or more base and a team of marines, with slightly varying goals in the campaign, which ultimately require the capture of all remaining bases and/or destruction of all alien hives. Variety is lacking, but the constant tide of aliens vs your rag-tag team of marines will keep you on the edge, inching slowly towards full domination.Sound and music are serviceable, graphics are bright and clean, albeit a bit too monotone and can make spotting your troops a bit of a challenge (especially with some overhanging cliffs textures). There is enough structures and technology to keep you engaged in random missions and skirmishes, but not enough depth of strategy to warrant investing more than a few hours after finishing the main campaign. Good fun for tough RTS fans but implementing multiplayer with a hive faction DLC would make this a solid title! 3.5/5			"

												You like endless swarm of swarms to shoot, burn, blow up and stuff ?Well this game is for you.---Pros:True endless swarm, no time limit, no kill limit, no spawn limit.Amazing balance, you'll often reach status quo with the swarm, were neither of you can advance.The gradual difficulty, which often make the single last hive much harder than when there were 7 of them.The diversity, you can play solely with marines, or with just one to build dozens of towers, or a mix of both.Cons:The game might get repetitive with time, in the same way a sandbox game can become.Very step but short learning curve. You'll loose the first few games thinking it's damn impossible, and when you finaly figure out how you wanna play, expert mode seems more like normal.--- Also my best buy of the steam sales.			"

												When i first looked at the game, i filed it under 'games i might get if the get cheaper'. Well the autumn sale rolled in and i thought i'd go for it. wasnt to sure what it would be like, but thought it was some sort of wave defense. Turns out its actually more a reverse tower defense. And a damn good one too. Its tricky, yet not punishing. Rewards all kinds of game play, from rushing, to careful pushing with a fairly open upgrade system and a very open game play system. I'd advise this to anyone who enjoys tower defense games in general, and to those who like a hoard mode game.			"

												I’ll keep this brief…”Infested Planet”, in my opinion, is a must-buy.  It offers so much for its fifteen dollar price tag (as of 3/7/14).  The skirmish mode and the customization options available gives the game almost unlimited replay value.  I can safely say that it will keep strategists like myself busy for months, even years to come.  Do yourself a favor and pick this little gem up…you won’t be sorry.  I’ll go as far as to say that “Infested Planet” is probably my favorite game since “FTL”, which is saying a lot.  Excellent, excellent game.

												I'm a big fan of StarCraft and science-fiction in general. I like the idea of survival and holding out as long as possible against overwhelming odds. So I was immediately sold when I read the game description. During the 20 hours I've played this game, I kept wondering to myself ""how did this game get 95% good reviews?!""Regardless of what you may read in the description of the game, there is only one survival mission in the story campaign. In the rest of them, you're wiping out the aliens on the map, and with more than 5 marines. Including air drops, you can easily get to 15 or more.The campaign isn't ""lengthy"" as described in the store page. You can beat it in less than 10 hours without rushing it. Overall, the game can be 100% finished in under 20 hours.I was expecting so much from the storyline. It ended up being a bad rip off of StarCraft and Starship Troopers, in my opinion. Felt like the dialog and plot were written by a teenager, and the very small number of characters (4 in total) are so cliché. One of them, the ""Sarge"", actually talks (well, there's no recorded dialog...) like Raynor from StarCraft and basically plays the same role.If you are used to playing RTSs, then this game is way too easy for you. Your soldiers don't permanently die, they automatically respawn. Everything you build, including units, is 100% recycable, meaning you can't make any permanent wrong decisions that you have to compensate for. Just recycle everything, fall back, and restart. You would think I need to play a harder difficulty? Well, sadly, there isn't really a difficulty option in the game.I didn't feel like the game was able to teach me about my units' strengths and weaknesses. I ended up using pretty much the same combination during the whole campaign. You can actually beat this game while only using 25% of all unit and building types at your disposal (I still have no idea what the grenade upgrade does and how to use it...). The balancing of the game is a big problem.Some missions are quite long to beat, yet the game lacks an in-game save feature. I've had to keep the game running in the background to not lose my progress. Music is repetitive, art is very simplistic...I think the worst part of the game is the level design. Though it boasts a ""procedural map"" system, all levels feel the same and can be beaten pretty much the same way. Not much diversity in objectives. The game tries to hide this fact by calling missions ""raid"" or ""capture"". But in the end it's just about killing alien Hives (another rip off from StarCraft...), the only real alien building of the game.That being said, I don't consider this a very bad game, but just not worth the price. And I don't think it should be considered an RTS, but rather a casual game with tower defense elements.			"

You play as some marines attempting to capture various nodes from a self-replicating alien swarm. There are upgrades that help provide a tactical advantage and specific classes you can train to make your units more diverse and better able to handle the threat that increases with each node captured. All around huge value for your gaming dollar and while based on a simple mechanic has more than enough fun and charm to keep your interest.9/10 Full price buy.			"

												This game is difficult, youll be stretched thin trying to figure out where to place troops so that the aliens dont overrun one front while pushing on another and praying the retaliation isnt too strong. Depth overall is pretty low but it is really well polished and balancing troop types/buildings to gain an advantage against the waves of aliens is very addicting. At $15 its a high price but overall id say its worth it. I keep coming back to the game because its great for jumping in, playing a few rounds and moving on.			"

												8.5/10.A gun-toting, mass alien slaughterfest!I'm a big fan of this game, it's so good I just keep coming back to play again!It's an action-packed top down RTS, with pause. The campaign doesn't get too weighed down with strategy and planning, instead focusing more on squad-based combat. Unlike other similar games, you won't spend the whole game waiting for building and research upgrade bars to finally reach 100% so that you can get on with the game. There are even inexpesive technologies that weaponise your bunkers, so you don't need to waste money on guards, or spend the whole game running back to re-capture defenseless capture points. That being said, there are certain times when strategy is necessary to win. You may need to think about how you put your group together, and which upgrades you give them to begin with, but after that it's just about blowing the hell outta alien scum!You can purchase weapons and tech in whichever order you please, which gives you the option to prioritise upgrades to match your playstyle. You can even purchase single-mission bonuses such as an additional sniper at the start of the game. Levels give plenty of money to stay up-to-date with upgrades, but even if you're struggling earlier levels are usually quite effective to farm.Some helpful tips: Note the difference between a ""single mission power-up"" and a weapon/tech unlock.Medpacs are very helpful for the first few missions, but pretty useless after that.Weaponising your bunkers is incredibly useful.The healing building is the most useful upgrade. (Combat is squad-based, you can't win without a good squad).Don't forget to use the attack-towards function when moving (Default button: A + Right Click).[ - ] Con's:My biggest problem with this game was that I couldn't find any way to manually select a specific bunker for my troops to respawn at.For example: When you lose a few troops while retreating, only to have one or two troops respawn at the other end of the map. You end up having to get them killed and hope that the aliens capture that spawn point while they are dead, so that they respawn at the right spot. -_- Admittedly, the graphics are a little lackluster.Level design barely changes from start to finishNo difference in terrain. Eg. No ""move slowly on this terrain"" & no flanking bonus & no ""less/more chance to hit"" depending on whether you are on higher or lower ground.			"

												I am sure this is really an Atari 2600 game with SNES powered grafix.It's absolutely brilliant in short or long bursts. You wont regret buying this.Light RTS Heavy Starship Troopers.Meaty campaign and with branching optional missions funding a tech upgrade system. Which you'll need to take on more advanced aliens and mutations (well over 20 random buffs) that make tactics vital. Difficulty curve is also handled extremely well.After that it's on to skirmish and randomly generated and endlessly tweakable alien settings. You can even turn of mutations you find too OP (if you're a noob. that is).Developer is still active in a 2 year long thread on the forum asking what he should add next. There's just no negatives here. Buy it.			"

Enemy AI pretty smart, they will try sneak and destroy un-defended bases.You will be better and better, try defeat the Achievements, make the game even more interesting on the battlefield.Playing the game without the ""Space"" Button make it really difficult, take me time to know this ""Decisions Saver"" button available.There is Singleplayer campaign, Leaderboard modes and Customise Skirmish maps. also can Zoom in and Zoom out on the field, for better view on the situations, or just for the Brutal Chaos :)Great Fun game to play, Recommend grab it on sale,  There is No Multiplayer yet but maybe will be one day ;)			"

												Great game that I thoroughly enjoyed completing.I want to address some of the negative comments. Most peoples problems boil down to them not having worked out how to play the game properly. By the sounds of it, the extent of their strategy is deciding do I build 7 shotgunners, or 5 flamers, and then do I attack this point or that point. No wonder they can't complete the later levels.This game requires constant 'recycling', and effective use of the limited resources. You need to do things like recycle old turrets and advance them forward, or turn your soldiers into snipers to take out the turrets, and then quickly switch them to flamours to rush in.Sometimes you have to let some of your bases get captured, so you can focus on capturing the enemies in a specific pattern. For example, allow a base that is being attacked from 3 directions to be captured, so you can work your way down 1 of these of these directions, then return to your original base and only have to fend off aliens in 2 directions.To claim this game lacks in strategies is absurd. The aliens will constantly beat you and cap your bases, so it is regularly 2 steps forward, 1 step back. If you can't handle 'losing for the greater good', then this game might not be for you.Saying this though, the full price does seem a bit steep, and I did get on special.			"

												Channeling a little Starship Troopers with a sprinkle of Cannon Fodder, Infested Planet is a very specialized kind of real-time strategy game. What it lacks in production values it makes up for with inventive gameplay that centers around “stemming the tide”. As you progress through the silly B-grade plot of the campaign - which harkens back to 90s video game storytelling - you face off against alien hives that spawn infinite enemies. Hundreds of alien grubs are constantly flowing towards your bases and marines. It’s a bit like a puzzle game, figuring out which marines to use for defense, where to place turrets, and which hives to take out first.When you destroy a hive, it becomes an additional base for your side and you gain “BP”, points added to a pool you draw from when building facilities, calling in more marines, or changing marines into different classes like Flamethrower or Sniper. You can undo your choices at any time to get the points back, and fluidly adapting to the situation becomes required. When you take a hive, the remaining hives on the map get a random mutation that can drastically alter the situation. Even if you fail a mission, you earn some money which can be used to unlock permanent upgrades or temporary boosts for the next mission.			"

												Great addition to RTS collection if one likes that genre. Command your starshiptroopers to victory against the horde.Let me put it this way, if you are decent at RTS genre(hotkeys over mouseclicking) and you have the patience to learn few tactics to beat different kind enemies. You will enjoy this game. The game has a good way to help if you get stuck with one time use soldiers so don't be afraid of the alien hordes. Check TB's WTF is... for good gameplay preview if still on the edge.			"

												I was playing one of the side missions, where every base you killed spawns an alien that runs away and spawns a new base if you don't kill it fast enough. Pretty simple.2 hours later, I'm still playing the same damn mission. There's 9 bases left, and they're all sitting in a cluster. Most of them are covered by a healing field. Every one of them has 9 powerups. I have to defend on 3 fronts from the swarms of aliens that are crawling toward my bases with no respite. Here are my options, and why every one of them won't do anything:Kill the healing field: This isn't an option. I can't even get near it, and even if I killed it, it would just come back in 20 seconds.Slowly whittle away at a corner until I can get a foothold: This is flat out never an option in any situation in this game. the second you stop attacking something, all of its turrets or spawners respawn. You can only make a dent if you do enough damage to kill a base in a single attack.Mass everything I have and push to take a base: Probably the best option and still utterly impossible. When I attack, 5 bases start sending dozens of kamikaze exploder bugs per second at my face. The continuous mass of ranged spitter bugs is still coming. The base I'm attacking shields itself so all my attacks tickle, and on top of that it's being healed. My attacks hurt me because of reflect, base turrets that far outrange me are hitting me and knocking my soldiers back with every shot. On a regular basis waves of assassins come to shoot my commander, and I have to blow missiles to kill them. While I do this, I'll lose my bases on every other front because I can't defend them and attack, and to top it off, the best case scenario is that it spawns a relocator that there's no way I'll be able to kill, that will just set up a new base somewhere else in the cluster.Restart, make sure I don't get into this situation: And there lies the problem. I couldn't stop it. There was a cluster of 3 here before the game started, and I couldn't defeat them without a lot of powerups. while I was taking out other bases, I couldn't stop all of the relocator bugs, because they're decently fast and very tanky, and it's impossible to follow them since every other one of the bugs that's attacking you slows you as well.Here's the issue: the game is designed with HUGE power asymmetry. you get a few troops and upgrades, and you're up against a dozen bases that swarm thousands of enemies at you constantly. every game is a war of attrition. The game feels like a chore. It's like a sailing game, where you don't sail the boat but you just sit there with a cup and bail water, but you can't plug the leak until everything else is dry.yeah, not every mission is that brutal. Yeah, there are other options, I could buy some one time power ups from farming easier missions and try again, or just skip it. Yeah, I could probably bash my face into the problem for another few hours and eventually win, because it's basically impossible to actually lose. Yeah, there are plenty of good points to the game as well. But nothing makes up for what an utter chore the game is. I'm not saying it's not fun, it is fun to an extent. I'm not saying don't play it, maybe it will be more your thing. I'm just saying that I found it a frusterating mess and I'm surprised it's rated so highly, so I wanted to throw my opinion in. If you want a similar game that's not only better, but cheaper, go play creeper world. "

												In Infested Planet you command a team of five elite soldiers against an endless horde of aliens. Surrounded on all sides, you must outmanoeuvre and outsmart the enemy. It's a real time strategy game. You start at a base called hive. And while you only hold a single hive your enemies hold a dozed hives.As soon as the game starts the enemies multiply rapidly and start moving in your direction to attack. You need to protect your hive and every conquered hive and at the same time you need to conquer all alien hives. This can get pretty tricky but it's a lot of fun. You start with a small amount of money. Money can upgrade your soldiers, buy air support, mines, mortars, cannons or healing and many other things. You are free to experiment because the game allows you to remove any upgrade and buy or build something else instead. Every time you conquer an enemy hive your total amount of money increases. Then there are mutations. The higher your difficulty level the more often the aliens will mutate. Every mutation makes things worseInfested Planet has a good story and is an extremely clever balanced game. It looks nice, is very addictive and in my opinion is a must have game. It's simply amazing.Pros: - lots of fun - nice graphics - good music - good story - allows very different strategies to win - developer is very supportive and keeps adding content and bug fixes - weekly challengesCons: - a few impossible achievements			"

												It's a very short game but super fun and addictive. It is a unique twist in a very pleasant way on tower defense. It still feels very much like a tower defense but the way it is presented is quite engaging. It takes a few elements I like, for instance; unit management and open planning. Add those elements to your usual tower defense and stragtegy and you get a very good game.			"

												Great game. It's very cheap too, which really helps in my decision to buy.With graphics, it's got a very nice visual style and the game still looks great ultra-zoomed in. Gameplay is nice, however it is a bit repetitive. This is no problem for me at all, I like the repetitive nature of the game and there is a lot of upgrades and buildings/weapons to try and shake it up.The game has you as a commander of a marine team facing huge hordes of thousands of aliens, and the gameplay really stands out as unique with the gradual progression of fighting back against the alien horde. You can always try out the free game 'Attack of the Paper Zombies' made by the same devs quite a while before this game to see what this game is like. 'Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal' is also a nice similar game.			"

												Great strategy game!  I picked this up during a steam sale dirt cheap and had a blast playing it.  It reminds me of the fast paced RTS rush you'd get from the early Command and Conquer games.  Base building is streamlined to the point of you deploy exactly what you want quickly, and the second you don't need that item anymore switch it out for another.  Very enjoyable game.  Hoping for an expansion or DLC pack in the future to expand on the game.  Quite a few missions and achievements to go after, but after that you're left wanting more.  Skirmish mode is fun to tinker with, and will most likely tie me over till new content arrives (which sounds like the developers are working on)			"

												""just 5 more minutes"" condensed down to a science.  This game has a persona about it, a feeling that you are constantly overwhelmed, yet capable.  Barring the enemy rolling a perfect storm of mutations, there is really no scenario where you  feel completely defeated.  Adopts the dwarf fortress ""losing is fun"" mentality while still remaining engaging.  Even when you lose, you learn something, and it makes you hungry to go back and try again.  An easy recommendation from someone who purchased this game on release day years ago and still plays it from time to time.  The most recent DLC isn't really my style, as it is rather repetitive and lacks the sense of progression you get from the campaign, but it did give me a reason to jump back in with a vengance, even when I got stomped mercilessly.

												So you start this game in campaign mode and think: ""Yeah that's pretty funny. Not that hard, but good."" Than you see all the stuff you can buy and wonder why you would need that, maybe play a skirmish match on a low difficulty and don't even need all that.Than you try out one of the harder difficulties, the random campaign missions for example. And this is where the game reveals it's true greatness: You have to completely reconsider your whole strategy because the game eats you alive and spits you on the floor. Impatient players might say the game is unbalanced or unfair, but actually it's perfectly balanced and necer unfair, but still really challenging.A low difficulty game takes like 10 minutes, harder games easily an hour. And you feel really good when your strategy works and you won a hard game.			"

												Concept: 10 / 10AI / controls: 6.5 / 10Mission design: 0 / 10The core mechanics of this game are good.  The early stages are fun, and the shop system makes you want to keep coming back.  The targeting AI for your marines is meh, but not bad enough to ruin the game.  The first half of the story missions are of acceptable quality.The second half of the game is a complete mess.  Later missions contain game-ending events, and unless you take an extremely specific set of precautions, you're dead.  The only way to beat some of these stages is to play them over and over until you learn the stage in advance, and specifically play to avoid the pitfalls you know are coming.The ambush mission is a great example.  You simply spawn at the top of the map, and alien hives randomly appear around you.  You have two directions to go, but one (securing the top of the map) isn't the ""correct"" way, and you'll die every time if you go there.  If you try to defend your starting point (an extremely logical move), you will die because alien hives appear under you for the rest of the stage until you die.  The ""correct"" answer to the stage is to fall back and let the aliens destroy everything as you retreat.  If you attempt any other strategy, you'll die.  There is no indication that this is the correct answer.  And that's what makes it so infuriating.If the level design wasn't so tremendously bad in the last half of the game, I could recommend.  Right now though it's just a $15 pile of frustration that will last you about 20 hours, tops.			"

You fall back, get wiped over the place,standing over the ruins of your strategy, wondering what could have gone so wrong. Then you go at it again, change things up, grab some stuff, fall backto a strategic position, leave other positions back as decoy, strengthen your defenses, holding out. The heightening feeling of watching your planwork, this time, they won't able to overrun you. You've even been ableto recover from that surprise attack at your flank. You've learnedfrom your intitial mistakes.

												A suprisingly well made blend between your standard rts and tower defense genre. Infested planet's premise is that you command a team of marines on a mission to wipe all bugs from ""I can't believe it isn't Klendathu"". Pros-Gameplay with a simple mission, but a great degree of freedom in accomplishing it-AI that seeming reacts to your style in how it mutates(upgrades) which makes for a good challenge-Simple yet deep tech tree that is open to the player and allows for easy blending of equipment and tech for different strategies-A custom mission maker which lets you set match parameters to whatever you like( starting marine number, number of hives, alien ferocity, etc...)Cons-As the matches heat up and your number of bases and marines increase it can be easy to start to lose track of everything(and the AI will abuse that)All in all, this games meets my golden rule of one hour of fun for every dollar paid, a great way to have some fun when you want to play a strategy game, but don't feel like doing anything that needs more than an hour.

												The first time I heard about this game was from this youtuber's review and also watching his LP (Let's  Play) video and I was just hooked enough to get the game.  It's a Top down strategy game where you control a few armies against swarm of aliens trying to eliminate one of their hive after the other.  Simple concept but it has a lot to offer for an indie game.  Every time you advance things get a bit tougher because of the alien mutations plus they sometimes went on a rampage at some point of the game each time you destroy one of their hives. But not only that. Since they're scattered across the map, they tend to re-capture undefended base and turn them back as hives. So there's a lot of micromanaging going on. Sure a few missions are manageable but as you progress, the game will encourage or even unleash your hidden strategic think-tank that's been cooped inside the core of your head for a long time and you don’t have a choice or else you'll lose the game.  But not to worry, perks like weapon modifications and support units (air drops, air strikes...etc) are in the game and usable on each mission. However, if you want to use them you have to earn money and to earn money you will have to win a couple of previous missions in order to advance and all that are in the game with no microtransactions required.  So this game is recommended to those who like RTS (Real Time Strategy) and/or wants to know how it feels like to get swarm by aliens with a few number of units to control like one of those bugs from Starship Troopers[www.imdb.com] ""These are the rules. Everybody fights, nobody quits. If you don't do your job I'll kill you myself. Welcome to the Roughnecks!"" - Rico from the movie. But in the game's case, Aliens will run you over. Have fun! "

Posted: October 12, 2016
												Alright, time to review another excellent strategy game here.  This time, Infested Planet.  I'm going to review the game AND it's expansions here, as I do think the game is best with the whole package.So what is Infested Planet?  This is best described as a squad-based RTS, with some tower defense (and tower offense...) elements and other things, against an enemy that's kinda similar to what you face in games like Creeper World 3 or the recent Particle Fleet.  Your foe consists of a kazillion seperate bugs that spawn from Hives, and for the most part the bugs are about as bright as a sack of hammers... they're mostly mindless.   But once a Hive has decided to activate, the bugs just.... keep.... coming.  There is a controlling AI, but mostly what that does is decide what targets the bugs will attack... they're still braindead things, wandering in straight lines... very predictable.Yet despite this, the enemy is still downright deadly.  Aside from the fact that there's a downright endless supply of bugs, the Hives will get stronger as the battle continues.  Destroy a Hive, and there's a good chance that the enemy will gain a mutation, a special global buff/ability/weird thing that lasts for the rest of that battle.  ALL of these are dangerous... these arent little minor things that can be ignored.  Often they'll force you to change up your tactics in interesting ways.  The enemy will start throwing new types of bugs at you, buff already existing structures/towers (yes, they have their own towers... now you get to see what it's like to have to assault those, as you *will* have to walk into their range over and over) and do all sorts of crazy things.Fortunately, you have your own bucket of tricks.  In each battle, you have BP that you can spend on various things.  You can either take a Marine and switch them to a different class (complete with different weapons and stats), build defensive structures like turrets or minefields, make research buildings that give you global abilities (so long as the building isnt flattened), and so on.  In addition, you have an Ammo meter, a slowly recharging thing that is used to power various one-off abilities that you can fire, provided you have them available, and also your rockets (always available.... usually).  While Ammo recharges, BP does not, however any time you ""undo"" something you've placed (even Marine class changes) you get the full amount of BP back.  This creates an interesting mechanic where NOTHING you do is permanent; if an enemy Mutation has suddenly made a certain research structure totally useless?  It's not wasted BP.... just recycle it and you instantly get all the BP back.  It also means you can keep changing your Marine's classes to suit the situation.   It keeps things INTERESTING, and deciding just what to do with these resources is never easy.   Each thing you have is useful.  But each thing is also weak to some type of assault that the enemy can throw at you.   There's not really much in the way of OP stuff in the game, and stronger things have much higher costs.All of that stuff means that the game never, ever feels mindless.   There's always something that needs taking care of, and often you have to figure out just how to go about that... a simple mindless assault almost never works.   What's more, you *cannot* just keep your squad grouped up all the time.  You *will* have to split them up, and you'll probably have to do this frequently.  This is a particular selling point to me, as alot of squad-based games I'm familiar with almost treat the ""squad"" like a single character as they tend to be always grouped together.  But this?  Try that and you'll lose. You have to get to know how much trouble a single Marine can handle on their own, and send the right number of dudes to do the right job.  WIth the right classes.   You can fortunately spend BP to get more Marines, having a max squad size of 10.  It's worth noting that there's ALOT of micro to be done in the game.  Marine positions always need adjusting, Snipers and Scouts always need to be pointed towards the highest-priority target at the time, class changes need to be made, ammo abilities need to be fired.... there's ALOT to do and you'll be giving tons and tons of orders, which gets loopy when you've got Marines on varying far-off parts of the map.  The good thing is, this is one of those games that doesnt expect you to be a Starcraft-esque technical master.  You can simply hit the spacebar to pause, issue some orders, and then unpause and they'll execute.  You can play the game at YOUR pace and stop to think whenever you need to.And that's good, because the complexity is always ramping up.  In the basic campaign you start off with very few classes/abilities/structures available, but as you go through missions you'll earn money, and you'll constantly unlock new things.  The enemy, too, will get stronger as you progress, doing more and more funky things.   Overall, the basic campaign's structure is pretty simple, very easy to understand.  But also a little uninteresting in some ways.If you want things to get more complicated though, the Planetary Campaign expansion adds, well, a new campaign mode.  This one is procedurally generated.... you dont know what it's going to be like.  You have an overall world map made of various sectors in whatever arrangement the RNG handed you, with a few territories under your control, and various enemy armies on different parts of the map.  You have multiple squads of your own, and you get two actions per turn, either moving/attacking with a squad, or certain other actions such as fortifying.  The enemy can then move their units, and will make a point of being as bloody irritating as possible when it does so.  As with the base campaign, you start off with very few abilities and things.... you'll unlock techs as you go.  However, the method is totally different here, AND, the structure of the tech tree is totally randomized.  Some techs will even be outright missing, unable to be gotten in that particular campaign.   You start off with a very small amount of guaranteed techs (such as the basic turret), and everything else is divided into tiers.  Tier 1 techs can be bought using tech points earned through battles.  But Tiers 2 and 3 must be unlocked by defeating enemy strongholds.   If the game has done something nasty like placed the Flamethrower tech on Tier 3, or just outright refused to let you have it at all?  Well, tough.... you'll just have to deal with it.  This all forces you to really think on your feet, as there is no ""best"" way to approach a tech tree that's utterly random every time.  Sometimes you'll have to rely on techs you dont normally use much (and maybe, you might find they're not so bad as you might have thought previously).  You'll have to come up with strategies you normally wouldnt use.   And dont forget: the enemy can still gain new abilities too (and they have ALOT of them to choose from).   The good thing is that the stuff that takes place on the world map is every bit as deep as you'd hope it would be, and links up nicely with the stuff that happens in individual battles.  Wether you're making decisions on the map, or in battle, none of your choices are ever easy.Speaking of easy:  This game isnt.  Chances are, you're going to run into the sorts of situations that make you say ""Okay WTF, how the heck can I possibly deal with THAT?"".   And then when you barely scrape through that situation with some brilliant scheme.... the enemy mutates, gaining something that totally shuts down the tricks you just used.  You're expected to perservere ANYWAY.  And I can say that it's very, very satisfying when you win despite all that.  Overall... a fantastic game (and expansions) with endless replay value and depth.... highly recommended here.			"

												I mean, it was $15 when I bought it and I got 9 hours out of it, so maybe that's enough value to recommend? But I agree with the other negative reviews, you reach a point where the difficulty turns into a brick wall. And because you're so INCREDIBLY limited in your units and build points, and because in those levels you're massively under siege the second the level starts, there's not like this great range of creative strategies you can play with. You've got five guys - I never got the chance to build the cool stuff I kept winning, I was having to use my points to spawn emergency troops to defend my ground - upgrading to shotgun troops was a luxury in those stages. And because you're so limited, yes, it feels like there's exactly one strategy and one build order that has any chance of working, and that if you take a wrong turn early you'll wind up with an unwinnable level (with nine alien colonies all stuck together, defending each other with turrets, making even a one-by-one assault impossible). That's just not enjoyable for me in a game of this genre, where I'm just randomly trying different things until I stumble across the exact perfect sequence the developers want. The difficulty truly feels cheap, like I'm just not being given any options.  By that point in the game I should be starting to feel powerful, with lots of cool options I can whip out against an overwhelming enemy.  I never felt that in this game.  "

												A surprisingly fun RTS. I didn't expect much going in, but I played all of the missions, including the extras. The mechanics are novel enough and the difficulty high enough to keep you interested. The only real problem I've observed with the game is that some of the items seem unhelpful to the point that you won't tie any of your precious few resources up in them.			"

												Infested Planet:Short version: this game is gud. (See: so short that I even managed to save a character while conveying “good”.)Short, interesting RTS. Small squad takes on infinite bugs. I find the most interesting of strategic decisions are the ones I’m forced to make after the situation changes unexpectedly. The core mechanics of Infested Planet build those situations into the game. Every success of mine as a player is met with a random twist on the part of the AI. This creates a set of situations which are at once familiar to long-term players, but also interesting even with the repetition. Also, this mutation mechanic helps avoid the core pain of many single player RTS campaigns: these maps aren’t puzzles, but rather are a constantly changing set of challenges.The other important bit that makes this game enjoyable: single mistakes are usually recoverable. As a player, I found it easy to create a stalemate that would allow me the space to think and breath and plan. And if I tried something that didn’t work, it was usually fairly easy to get back into that stalemate situation while I something new. Mistakes were usually punished just enough for me to know that I’d made one, but not so hard as to cause me to restart my entire attempt. Clever, clever system.			"

												Excellent diamond in the rough, simple but addictive.Top-down RTS. You get a group of marines to start with and a single base area.Now it is up to you to take the rest of the map. No particular weapon/upgrade/tech will win you the game. Adapting to the situation will.One of the best features of the game is that maps are not fixed, when you restart the mission the map will be generated in a different layout. Almost making skirmish obsolete, if it were not for the fact that it allows total control over what settings will be used.Edit:To add to the 'map generation' part. 'Story missions' always have the same map. The other types of campaign missions will be generated as you go.To be a bit more specific: the game has a campaign, but the campaign has a story line and several other type of missions that are somewhat connected to the story missions (you need to unlock the 'non-story' missions).Beyond that you have skirmish mode with several gametypes, and a seperate 'weekly challenge' section with several mission types of wich one has 3 different difficulties.I.o.w. you'll more than likelly see me still playing this game in 10 years or so :)			"

												I really suck at RTS, but this game has just the perfect scope for me. Few units, but a lot of choices to make. Should I invest in different soldier weapons, turrets or buy the ability to call in airstrikes? What hive should I capture next to gain the most advantage? Later on in the same game I might sell the airstrike in favor of a minigunner or sniper, and so on.As you play, the enemies mutate and become different and you suddenly need to adapt your strategies.Small bite-sized (15-30 minutes for me) levels with a lot of depth, and when you play the Campaign mode you earn money to unlock new upgrades between each mission even if you were to fail, so it always feels like you're making progress.The music is wonderfully thumpy and deep, and I'd recommend the game just for that even if all else sucked, which it doesn't.

												This game is straight awesome.  Part Starcraft, part... well, Starcraft, but not the same.It's got a TD feel to it, and you're always fighting Zerg-types, but there's enough variety in missions that it's not the same game over and over.  Further, there's weekly challenges with leaderboards, at varying difficulties.You generally lose a mission when you've lost all your bases (which can be upgraded as you do missions and earn cash), though some are timed, with bonus time awarded for reaching objectives, and more cash earned for longer games more slaughter... and though thousands upon thousands of aliens die per mission, it's quick and easy to learn, with a good tutorial and good interface options between click/hotkey to make both options usable within a couple of missions.  Pay attention when Sarge tells you to get the shotguns, and use the hell out of them for the duration.However, miniguns and flamers for win.After you've played a few games you'll unlock new buildings/abilities/skills, which can be built/bought during missions, hence upgrades to your troops and bases.  You can also re-run missions to gain Steam achieves with the new technology (hence the TD feel).Again: miniguns and flamers for win.Most of the tough spots I've found so far have been such that I can park a couple of guys next to my bases, which, after you unlock bunkers, will keep them healed while they blaze away, while you figure out what to do next... and some of the scenarios are challenging enough to warrant a wider view of the map and observation of the flow of enemies.  Most non-starter scenarios have had bonus mission award (during-mission currency, used to buy upgrades for troops or buildings) options, so you have a choice sometimes between trying to zerg back at them for a fast win, or taking the long road and wading through thousands more bodies with heavier guns.So like I said: miniguns and flamers for win... but officers help, too.Fun game, for sure - good job, RocketBear!

												A genuinely innovative RTS, where rather than simply mashing units together until the enemy is spammed to death, the enemy is an infinite horde that can only be managed rather than destroyed. Your squad consists of only a few individuals, and for them to defend a map's various capture points requires a great deal of care in their positioning and equipment. Because the aliens randomly mutate (gain new abilities and units) the further you advance, the tactics required for every battle will be different, and the tactical situation within each battle is always changing. For example, a single soldier with a flamethrower may be able to hold of a swarm of basic enemies indefinitely, but when the aliens mutate they may start sending ranged enemies that will eviscerate the short-ranged flame trooper, or armoured tower spawners that will make his position indefensible. A hard decision will have to be made whether to retreat, or to reassign valuable soldiers from other vital points to help him. Resources have to be carefully balanced to plug every gap in your lines, and because the enemy is always changing, on harder missions your defence is rarely stable for long, and victory cannot be achieved through a single strategy. One of the most welcome innovations in Infested Planet is that all upgrades and defensive emplacements are completely refundable in-game, allowing you to continually adapt your force to counter the aliens. The only real cons I can think of for this game are that the music is droning and uninteresting, and sound effects and animation arent great, but this hardly detracts from the excellent mechanics of the game, and Infested Planet's visuals make up for this by being crisp and colourful.

												Infested Planet is essentially a tactical RTS, but without the messy resources and busy manufacturing queues. As commander of space marines, you are tasked to wipe out whatever baddies you come across, and these guys adapt to your tactics, and will throw you quite a few surprises. Think of it more as a puzzle, than a straight combat game, and you should have fun. The graphics are fairly minimal overhead view without fancy-shmancy 3D options. No rotation, just scrolling. The idea is simple: start with one ""base"" area, and you need to beat back the alien horde with your marines and maybe some sentry turrets, but you need RPs (resource points) to build them, and you can also use RPs to buy enhancements for your teams, such as medical pods (healing), grenades, shotgun upgrades, minefields, officers, and so on. Some are semi-permanent, others are single-use buffs only.  RPs can only be earned by killing alien hives. So basically the trick is build the right stuff at the right time. if your marines got killed, replacements are sent down to the nearest conquered ""point"". Your marines also have some heavy weapons (think RPGs) that can be used to kill individual units. If you find some ""metal"" you can have it dragged back to the control points where it is added to your RPs. You can also find ammo crate which gives you back your ""ammo"" (for heavy weapons) immediately rather than wait for it to SLOWLY regenerate. As you beat up aliens, you unlock more toys to play with, such as extra med pods, shotgun, minigun,  extra marines, officers, etc. But obviously, the alien horde gets better too. First it's just swarm, then alien hives gets ""gunners"", then they can generate their own ""marines"", mines, mini-spawn nodes, hive artillery, speed rush... and more. You can play either story missions or ""raid"" missions. Story missions advances the plot, while raid missions just earns you money that lets you unlock even more toys. So the key is build just enough to help you take out one hive at a time and build defenses to hold the points, but there's a lot of different ways to do it... Do you blitz the hive and accept casualties, or do the turret leapfrog, i.e. build turrets to cover each other and advance slowly but surely? I've went through a dozen missions by now and there's two dozen more to go, and there are weekly challenges, and there's some updates coming soon. You can repeat the ""raid"" missions to earn more money for the goodies. All in all the game is a lot of alien blasting fun as you groan at loss of each marine and cheer when you take out each hive. The game may not be flashy, but it is a lot of fun. Highly recommended.			"

												This is a fantastic little RTS. It's fairly simple to pick up and play, yet throughly addicting. The single player campaign, while perhaps not strong in story, ramps up the challenge very quickly, yet in a way that lets you become prepared for the next challenge. Sometimes, it feels almost like a puzzle; one ends up needing to evaluate each and every move/attack you make, lest some mutation occour that makes the bugs able to attack your holdings before you can respond to it. And, trust me, you WILL be forced to respond to these mutations, especially if the AI is set up to pick mutations. Some of them work so well together that it makes the mission nearly impossible to beat, but that's part of the fun, too. It's a solid game and I have recommended it to numerous friends.Also, if you like Warhammer 40,000 and ever wondered what it would be like to command troops during a Tyranid invasion, this will give you a pretty good idea of what that would be like. Just saying.			"

												TLDR: If you're looking for RTS games, it's one of the best.Did not expect the game to be this great!Unlike most RTS games I've played, EVERY unit here feels valuable! The AI is really cool. Here's one of the reasons why: For example, I have a team of five, one of them is a sniper.The sniper knows what he's there for, which is taking out small spawning pods and turrets.So, when I send the entire team to attack a hive, the sniper seems to prioritize the targets more suited for him.You could also take control of each unit individually and micromanage, of course.On average, each game takes 10-20 mins(at least for me). Easy to jump into, easy to stop playing. (I'm one of those people who want to play something, open the library, stare at it, and can't decide on what to play, end up closing steam and doing something else <_<. I also easily lose track of time.)So far, I have only played the game for around 12 hours, and it is already among my top 5 favorites.			"

												This turned out to be deeper and more fun than I expected. Instead of just another indie title, it's a full, polished and compelling single-player campaign with some nice little extras like weekly challenges. While it's great in terms of gameplay and campaign, it's also fairly shallow overall, and can get repetitive after you've explored all the tech and research, but it's still very much worth at least a single campaign play-through, which clocks in at a minimum of around 6 hours, and a great game overall.HighlightsWhere this shines above similar titles is the simple, refined and fun gameplay. It's not the deepest strategy game around, and the focus is on units here, rather than structures as in traditional RTSs'. Rocket Bear have cleverly added the strategy elements here, and worked on the mechanics like quick queueing of unit orders, quickly selecting and switching between units, intelligent prioritization based on weapons, and plenty of little things that make strategy and micro-control matter more as the game gets harder and fuller and you progress through the campaign. It's a nice switch of focus from traditional RTS, and it's done very well.The difficulty has been optimized well too, and this game can generally be played very casually, with a focus on brute force and repetition for those who don't want to think or micro too hard, but at the same time it doesn't take away anything from those who do, and even encourages faster times for completion which means getting smart, fast and learning to hot key and micro really well will be rewarding for you in a way many other titles don't offer.* The soundtrack too, is pretty under stated and very good at keeping pace and mood while also being fun tracks. I found myself humming along with the title screen and in game a few times. The artist and a couple of demo tracks can be found here[helpcomputer.bandcamp.com]. It's just a shame there are so few tracks.Mistakes and AnnoyancesThere are a few annoyances and perhaps mis-steps here, but they're mostly unnoticeable and overall don't harm the game in any big way. The most encompassing problem I kept running into was the lack of solid tutorial/guide elements which meant that I'd continually reach a stage in latter maps where I didn't know what to do to get further, and only by experimenting over and over with new strategies til I found something that worked on different parts of the map could I move forward. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in most strategy games, since the player is expected to learn to progress, but even with the few intro missions, there are so many aspects of this game that you often don't have any clue on possible strategies as a new player and may simply hit a brick wall over and over.The other thing worth mentioning is that the menu system is somewhat discombobulated and annoying. Units, for example, are listed on the top left in a bar, the unit buy/sell select at the opposing side, and the structure/research menu trees and further option/triggers to the bottom right. This means that unless you're 100% familiar with the hot keys then you'll continually find yourself staring at opposite corners of the screen to view information and select options. Add in the game options being in a middle menu, the progress buttons being further down on title screens, the screen swap selections being in another location on different menus and other strange placements and things get even more erratic. It's a strange albeit minor issue that could easily be refined.RecommendationsPriced at £10.99/14.99€/$14.99 and £13.59/17.99€/$17.99 for the Deluxe Version (which includes the DLC) at the time of review, Infested Planet does seem a little steep on price, especially when compared to competitors. Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal, for example, is cheaper and offers near countless re-playability and content. However, clocking in at around 6-8 hours for the campaign and at least double that for completionists and when considering the harder difficulties and skirmish mode and weekly challenges, it's still good value for money if you're likely to sink a lot of time into it. For everyone else I'd recommend waiting for a sale of -50% or lower to make this a fantastic deal.* The Trickster's Arsenal DLC is priced at £3.99/4.99€/$4.99 and a worthwhile addition, adding a level of difficulty with new enemies and mutators, and new weapons and abilities that mix up gameplay. However it's also quite small in terms of content and since the price of the base game is already a contention issue, I feel the content should have been included in the game, or reduced in price. If you've played through the campaign and want to sink more time into Infested Planet, it's a great buy, for anyone else, it's worth waiting.Unedited review notes 19/09/2015 for Infested Planet:

-Annoying menu system, and no way to start a new campaign?
-Lack of on-point tutorial elements
+Under stated and fairly good soundtrack
+First time I've seen an option to select amount of CPU cores in a small game

												Infested Planet is a game that would be most easiest equalized to a commander version of Starship Troopers.The Aliens i will refer to as ""Bugs"".So what you do?You command a troop of hired marines through a story of Bug hunting.The mechanics of the Game are highly complex, well worked out and the Bugs mutate in many ways to give you a good tactical Brain tickler. The story i didnt bother too much with, asfrom the point of reading the text, i just did the missions.Aside the Story, there is randomized bonus maps, where you can earn the cash to upgrade your tech, as by Equip for Marines, fielded Buildings that give Bonuses, special Abilities and tactical StructuresThe Difficulties of these increases, and so does the reward.In the store you can get beside Tech, Mercenaries, that increase your Squad for one Mission.There is no pay to win, when i say store.The Developer responds on the Discussion part, which is awesome. Thumbs up.Its a top down, Squad based Real Time Strategy.Squad based as in, you only have a limited amount of troops, that you need to utilize, aswell as tactical Ressources.I got the game a long time ago, and dont remember what i paid, plus the Tricksters Arsenal DLC.Definitely worth a pick up, if you like to squeeze Bugs and like to fiddle tricky missions. Especially the Terminus and Abyss difficulty random Maps are great, and can last up to 40 mins.			"

												TL;DR: Watch Youtube for gameplay, it's a simpler game with a small number of quirks and bugs (that's a good thing). The campaign is 9 hours of alien murder mayhem and surprise alien sex.This is mostly put here to address downvote issues I've seen.Crashing: I dunno, but it does seem to happen to others, maybe 1x every 10 hours.Difficulty: starts easy, does spike, but once you figure out which upgrades go together (free grenades gets more useful the more marines you have) and get to know the alien mutations (Burrowing Hive is code for ""surprise alien buttsex""), then the game becomes manageable.Simple to medium complexity in the game, go watch any Let's Play on Youtube for gameplay. I personally got this game because I was so frustrated watching a bad LPer. Gameplay is fluid and fast paced; though the space bar does initiate a very useful tactical pause. Challenges lie in the subtlety of some mechanics (see free grenades above), choosing a good upgrade path (mines suck), and situational awareness; the last item due to the way aliens will shift their attack routes. Those that said the base game is 9 hours were spot on.Would have prefered a commanding officer/player avatar that can be upgraded: health, weapon/unit type, speed, poison immunity, healing, respawn time, free grenades, etc. A little more player connection and a way to spend moolah; the most expensive upgrade is 100,000 or so and you'll end up with over 1 million in the bank if you do side missions well.The pay for the final mission is also pitiful for what humanity gets out of it, and you're ultimately left without the feeling of being space rich, which is, of course, the main selling point of the game. :PUltimately, the game's alright, as others say, wait for a sale, since it feels like it's worth $10 as opposed to $15.

												I had been eyeing this game for a long time; it looked like a lot of fun but I was a bit put away by the cost. When I finally saw it was on sale, I got the Deluxe Edition right away.Oh boy, it is fun!I think the closest comparison to how this game feels is the film Starship Troopers. The core of the game is as follows: on each randomly generated map, there are several capture points. One of them is yours, and the rest are the aliens'. You have to send your small team of marines to capture these points. However, there is a hive to destroy on each one, protected by automated defenses, not to mention the ENDLESS stream of bugs that will go after you. By capturing points and collecting some crates spread around the map you get resources that you can spend on more marines (dead ones respawn), new weapons for your marines, turrets, robot medics, global abilities and more. However, since these resources are limited, you will have to decide and eventually recycle your buys because...... the aliens aren't static either. For each point you capture, they will get a permanent mutation according to your strategies. For example, using flamethrowers might cause their poison turrets to have a knockback effect, or have a much longer range. Their hives might start to spit acid themselves. Their critters and spawners might enter frenzy mode after you capture a point. They might start to spawn hardened critters, living bombs or even clones of your marines! As the aliens adapt, you'll have to adapt as well, by recycling upgrades (for 100% of their cost) and reconsidering your strategy. There are a lot of mutations and upgrades, so the game never gets old. The game has a campaign, random skirmishes and ""weekly challenges"" where you compete with other players for a place on the leaderboard. The campaign is quite varied, and serves both as an introduction and as a way to play special missions, like escorting a convoy or testing a new lifeform. You'll earn credits by completing these increasingly difficult missions, which you can spend on unlocking all these cool upgrades for your marines (I guess in Skirmish mode all of these upgrades are already unlocked). The story is cliché, but enjoyable.I highly recommend getting the Trickster's Arsenal DLC. It adds new toys for both your marines and the aliens, among other stuff, giving some nice additional variety to an already varied game. If you can, get the Deluxe edition!I must mention the dev is making another DLC that adds a conquest-like campaing, where you would be capturing regions of the planet via regular missions, and unlocking upgrades as in the current story campaign. Since he announced he was working on it on March, I'd say we can expect this new DLC to arrive soon...Finally, the simplicity of the graphics means it will probably run super smoothly on the vast majority of computers. Units and effects are simple but pretty, and retain a lot of detail if fully zoomed in. It does look and sound nice to me.Oh, and one can't review this game without mentioning the HUGE bodycount. On the post-mission summary, it's normal to have killed tens of thousands of aliens and having lost tens of marines. A nice reminder of the scale of the battles!To finish my review: a game that is genuinely fun to play, that will make you think to overcome the AI's reactions to your own strategies, with a lot of ways to play, and space marines vs bugs, plus continued dev support. Do I recommend it? Hell yeah!			"

												Simple but surprisingly enjoyable action/strategy game with tight resource management and a focus on squad management.  It has elements of tower defense, Creeper World, and occasionally evokes classics like Syndicate or Cannon Fodder with its small squad mobile combat.  Resource management, area control and denial, timing, and concentration of force versus surface of defense - these are the sorts of challenges this game is about, and although it tackles them simply, there's enough going on that it's not simplistic.  Although this is not a huge game, it isn't asking for huge game money, and what's there is well put together.  The campaign has slightly above-average video game writing and characters; not worth playing the game for, but skippable, and I didn't skip all the dialogue so it must be doing something right.  Mostly it teaches you how to play the game and introduces some fun scenarios to test yourself against.Where the game falls down is in its repetitiveness on higher difficulties; it's very easy to fight yourself into a stalemate where you don't quite have the resources to push.  You'll gain ground by inches over tens of minutes, and then lose it again in seconds.  So this game can feel pretty sisyphean at its toughest, which some players might enjoy, but I found sometimes frustrating.  I also wish there was more to the game - the high level techs offer you a decent number of options, and many of them are useful, but it often felt there was either one clear way to deal with a situation, or no good way.  Some more scenarios would be nice - the randomly generated missions are great, but more varied objectives and scenarios would greatly improve replayability.Still, there's something strangely compelling about the experience, and it has a certain old-school charm.  Certainly not without flaws, then, Infested Planet delivers on its promise with craftsmanship and conviction, and at a very reasonable price point.			"

												Excellent game, it has an interesting story and challenging gameplay.  The graphics are simple but it doesn't detract at all from the experience.  The mechanics are solid, easy to learn, and I didn't experience any bugs (other than the ones I was shooting. lol)  Lots of replayability and you can even go through the campaign again after you beat it with all the stuff you unlocked.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games and killing thousands of aliens.			"

												EDIT:Went back and finished the story campaign (ended up buying some upgrades to make it FUN after trying again without them, whether or not it's POSSIBLE to win without them is moot at this point).Did I end up having to wait 6 months to finish the game?Nope, mostly because I'm stubborn / willing to hear out other gamers.Did I have a lot of fun playing this game?Ehhhh... right up until the last 1/2 or so to be honest, the later levels lacked the same sense of pacing or strategy.This is where Steam needs a Grey / Neutral review choice.Final review:5.2 / 10I certainly didn't loathe my time spent with Infested Planet, but if it were somehow possible I would tell past-me to try a demo first or something before buying.------------------------------------------------------------------I'm actually pretty angry about this game, because it started off really fun and well-paced and was almost reminding me of good old Command & Conquer style RTS fun which is pretty much the highest compliment I can pay a game of a similar genre (I honestly enjoyed like probably the first half of the missions).Then Infested Planet abruptly devolved into a mobile phone / tablet game-esque nightmare of pointless, repetative mechanics.Thus, I have dubbed this game Grindfected McSnoozefest.I guess they ran out of cool alien types or ideas for how to make the marines keep on evolving and adapting to the aliens as they changed?The ammo and supply mechanics made sense and were appropriately challenging at first.The ability to change and reset soldier's weapon types on the fly felt very strategic and intutive, allowing me to adapt to changing situations or counter specific enemies.However, now that I've purchased / unlocked most of the tech tree (which took me more play time than would allow me to still recieve a refund), I've realized that pretty much the only way I will EVER get to build and use the best tech-upgrade or heavy-duty defensive  structures - is by grinding through a bunch of levels I've already played before just so I can earn enough cash to buy a truckload of single-use unit buffs (buffs which I would normally buy using my supplies in the mission, as opposed to the cash I earn from completing missions).Seriously devs I hope you see this: if the only way to win the next mission in your story, is by forcing players to redo 3-4 other side missions (that they've already beaten before, possibly multiple times) in order to earn enough cash to buy a bunch of one level only power-ups (which don't actually make me feel like I'm winning, they just even the odds enough that the battle shifts from insultingly impossible to a long, boring, slow, repetative grind towards some sort of ""victory"") - then you have failed to grasp the concept of a well-paced strategy game, and are clearly more accustomed to designing game mechanics centered around pay to win and micro-transactions (ie. the money grubbing scum of the gaming industry).Yup, the price-tag on this game *was* low so I didn't expect a AAA blockbuster game with Hollywood voice acting and Blizzard quality cutscenes.However, I did expect to be able to play through the entire story / campaign of my $5 game without wasting countless hours of my life repeating the parts of the game that I've already finished before I can play each new mission.Bad form, low class, made even worse by actually having the foundation of a potentially solid game which winds up getting completely lost in a hurricane of poor mechanics and lazy design choices.Maybe I'll try this game again in 6 months when you've lost most of your player-base and decide to release a balancing patch?Until then, I'm just glad I got it on sale and not full price...

												This game is really fun!  Sort of a small squad-based RTS mixed with some minor tower defense elements; mostly it is you just killing hordes and hordes of crazy aliens.  With some obvious nods to Starship Troopers, of course.There is a decent progression system with lots of upgrades that unlock over time.  And the Story campaign lets you choose which missions you want to take on after the first few intro ones.  I wish there was persistence with my soldiers from mission to mission, though.There are a few different mission types, from quick raids to defense to all-out-slaughter, which mostly determines how you want to spend your initial deployment points.  The maps are randomly generated, so even if you replay to do better or earn more money it won't be exactly the same every time.The graphics are serviceable but definitely don't impress in screenshots (or even videos).  However, once you see swarms of hundreds of aliens moving across the map that all kind of fades away.Another downside is that the game doesn't do a great job of explaining how some things work.  For example I can't figure out how to use some of the upgrade buildings, and the missions quickly turn so frantic that I don't have the time to mess with it.  Apparently there is a spacebar decision pause mode, which it didn't explain at all and I only learned about from other reviews right now.  :/I got this in a cheap pack with all the DLC, but haven't even messed with the DLC stuff yet and it has been completely worthwhile.  Frantic, well balanced, just-one-more mission gameplay.			"

												It's a decent game.  I jumped back into it the other night after finishing it way back in a much earlier stage.  Found that the dev had added many more story missions as well as 2 random mission paths (one timed with bonuses, the other untimed with straight payout).  I disagree with the rant on the graphics.  They are decent and good gamplay always trumps eye candy in my opinion.  Especially when I have few laptops of varying graphics capabitilities that I tend to switch back and forth depending on the situation.As far as gameplay goes, the difficulty increases rapidly with the new updates (not sure if what I had played previously has changed), and your standard marine becomes obsolete very quickly with each mission.  This brings me to my main suggestion for improvement (according to myself).  Your BP is a bit too low at the start of each mission for my tastes, and because of that, along with how weak the standard marine is in the mid to late game, I spend all my BP points earned throughout the game on upgrading my starting marines as well as the few reinforcements I get (and the occasional turret).  It would be nice to have enought to dabble with some of the buildings and other structures as well.  Maybe have unused BP at the end of each mission carry over to the next?  I don't know.  Just a thought.  Seems like that would promote getting the most out of what you start with (which is what the game does already) as well as rewarding you for doing it well.Anyway, the game is easily worth it for the 50% you get right now.  It is a bit rewarding when it's all you can do to hold the line on three fronts, wondering how you are going to get the upper hand, and then you figure something out that ends up in victory.  I do enjoy that.			"

												Infested Planet is a relatively simplistic Real Time Strategy. The basic premise is that the enemy has infinitely spawning alien bugs, and you have infinitely spawning Marines. Your job is to slowly advance your territory, conquering enemy hives and turning them into bases. More bases gives you more resources to summon more marines, or to equip them with bigger weapons, or build enhancements on your bases.Of course there's a catch: Every time you conquer a hive, the enemy gains a new bonus, such as more armor for its insects, the ability to spawn new types of insects, longer ranged attacks, or whatever. This essentially means that as you're gaining more resources, you also need to spread your forces thinner to protect all of your bases, and the enemy is also getting stronger, so the match gets more difficult as it goes on.It's not a very difficult game. I found it to be a fun challenge for me and I beat the story campaign in about 7-8 hours, but I'm really bad at RTS games. A seasoned veteran of Starcraft and similar games should probably steer clear, because it will just be too easy for you.			"

												A real-time tactics game where you control a small squad of marines and need to decimate a couple of thousand aliens.The challenge comes in is that as you take over portions of the map, you gain resources to build more stuff, but the aliens gain ""mutations"" that give them extra powers and make it more challenging.  The end result is that the game starts easy and gets progressively more difficult as the game goes on.The game is a tactics game, not a strategy game, so there's not much in the way of resource management or base building -- it's all about efficient usage of your few marines.  The game is also pause-able, and you can give orders while paused, so there's no requirement of fast reflexes or decision-making.All in all, the game has a very satisfying level of difficulty, where it is hard enough to be a challenge without being unfair or impossible.  It also encourages experimentation with the various options, since any resources you spend on something will be refunded if you decide you no longer want it.Each ""mission"" runs for 10-40 minutes or so, depending upon your aggressiveness and speed of play.  There's four tutorial missions, a campaign mode of ten pre-set missions, options for random missions of various difficulties, and a weekly challenge of four different missions with a leaderboard of who can do each one the fastest.  If you enjoy blowing up endless streams of aliens, or enjoy tactical squad-based combat, you will enjoy this game.			"

												This game is a masterpiece.It is huge fun, very accessible, challenging, unique and fairly deep. If you love WH40K, Starship Troopers, RTS and/or strategy games, you will love Infested Planet.The game is simple but not simplistic. The interface is clean and effective, controlling your units is intuitive. Despite being a strategy game, the balance of action and decision-making is excellent. The complexity of the game comes from the way the various systems (simple unto themselves) combine to provide a wide variety of situations to which the player must adapt. Despite the apparently simple gameplay, there is real depth here.It is very easy to get playing. The story campaign starts with short easy missions, but ends up with massive slogs with full tech trees and hundreds of thousands of enemy casualties. You earn money to unlock new troops, techs and advantages along the way. You can emply many kinds of tactics from airstrikes to small high-tech squads with flamers and miniguns to large Imperial Guard-style meatgrinding charges.The release of the dynamic ""Planetary Campaign"" DLC has greatly boosted replayability. The campaign will have you saying ""just one more turn"" and before you know it, hours have passed. The player can choose from five map sizes and five difficulty leves. Map layout and available techs are randomized. Part of me hates this (when I don't have my favorite tech available), but part of me appreciates that this forces the player to try new things, further extending the replay factor.The graphics are fairly simple but very evocative, the sound design likewise. There are very distinctive aural clues to certain enemy types appearing, your bases being attacked, etc. When you close your eyes after a long gameplay session, you will see hordes of aliens in your mind's eye.The developer is active on the forums and responds to the community. He has continued to support and expand the game.Infested Planet is a master class on how to make a single player PC game. A clear vision, refined mechanics, trust in the players to understand and enjoy the game, customization and technical proficiency. I have not encountered a single bug (other than the millions my troops have splattered).The one thing I would wish for is mod support.Buy this game and all expansions, you will not be disappointed.

												I like this game a lot. The mechanics of the game involes a squad of 5 Marines that you can control to move to a location. You fight a horde and I mean a HORDE of bugs that spawn from a hive (There are many on all levels) and they get mutations which make the game a little harder but you can counter with changing your marines to different clases, ""researching new things"" which means building structures, and building defensive turrets that can be offensive. This all runs on BP (Battle Points? IDK). Some things are annoying like the voices that replay too much once you give the marines a command. There is also a really in dept guide for this game that shows you how to beat every mission and get most of the acheivment. There is also a survival mode, campaign, weekly couple of missions where you can see where you place with ppl everywhere and randomly generated levels. Go check out the guides or not and try out the game. (Excuses my spelling if there are any errors and don't hate if I missied anything please.) ^.^			"

												Really digging this, it's a top-down squad level RTS - pretty much what i was actually looking for when i picked up Survivor Squad. Lots of gribblies to shoot, lots of fast-paced on-the-fly squad tinkering (you can swap out weapon loadouts instantly as you are playing between squad members) It seems silly in terms of realism, but given the pace of the game (particularly once you get to later levels or try some of the more advanced skirmish maps, which you can make as hard or easy as you want) you'll understand why. You roam the map taking down alien hives, every few you kill the enemy gets a random mutation to make things more difficult, some are awkward, some are devestating, some are pointless without other mutations, but it keeps things fresh figuring out the tech buildings you need to use or the equiptment you need to take in order to counter the new mutation.Highly recommended, i'd dearly love to see a sequel to this, preferably with an even larger and more varied tech tree to unlock with my hard earned cash - it seems a bit too easy at the moment to just grind mid-level repeatable ""search and destroy"" missions to unlock everything pretty fast.Absolutely worth your time, highly recommended!

												It's a seriously difficulty game at times, but it's incredibly satisfying as well.  Lots of random replayability, and based on the modifiers and map layouts you WILL need to change tactics pretty often, which the game in no way impedes.  Well worth the money IMO if you're interested in a squad based ""rogue-like"", in terms of randomness, difficulty, and some progression in campaign.			"

												Starship Troopers: The GameSolid indie title. It's a singleplayer squad-based RTS with optional pause and tower defense elements, or something along those lines. Just watch the Steam trailer for a good impression.The campaign is rather short but the game also comes with a bunch of optional game modes with various difficulty levels, weekly challenges and a customizable map generator to create your own challenges.The game has two pieces of DLC available at the time but I haven't purchased those yet.

												RTS games usually keep the scales relatively balanced when it comes to unit distribution. Infested Planet throws almost all of that out the window. While the aliens seem to have a happy society in place, it falls on your shoulders to disrupt it entirely and establish something much more pleasing to the obviously superior human eye. Thousands of aliens will march toward you in defense of their home, but we are determined to rid this completely non-sentient planet from its infestation. It’s not a genocide! It’s liberation! Moral questions aside, Infested Planet offers extremely unique strategic gameplay with thousands of enemies marching on almost every base relentlessly. Will it colonize your heart? Or is this game a plague? Let’s look closer at Infested Planet.Infested Planet doesn’t offer a string of interlocking building or unit upgrades, and for that I am SO grateful. Instead, rewards are offered for completing missions which can be used to purchase a variety of upgrades to your units. There are grenades, to class unlocks, along with a variety of buildings which allow you to suit your ground forces to your playstyle. Are your heavy machine-gunners a bit to slow and unwieldly to hold the entire map all by themselves? Pepper in a shot-gunners and some scouts to do the legwork. As your heavies push toward the enemy bases, perhaps you will find yourself overwhelmed again. Upgrade a couple of them to flamethrowers and watch as the swarm is beat back by a wall of flame. If all else fails, build a helipad to bring in chopper-strikes and thin the horde. The options are limitless, and all equally satisfying.Aside from picking how you want to destroy the hive during gameplay, there are also a ton of game-modes that allow you to customize HOW you want to play. One of my personal favorites features a time-limit and permadeath, which makes the impending horde that much more terrifying. The story mode features some aspects that constrict freedom of play, but I would argue that that’s what a game does. Sometimes there is a path that must be taken, the freedom still comes in the way you decide to take it. I found myself repeatedly playing missions to get the maximum amount of money possible in order to unlock the next delicious explosives-laden fruit from the tech tree. Not a necessary thing to do, but the randomized levels keep things consistently fresh.The story in this game falls quite flat, and doesn’t attempt to touch on the bevy of moral questions. The level design doesn’t seem extremely meticulous largely due to the randomized nature, but Infested Planet has certainly earned its place in my Steam library. Very few games offer enemies this endless. Your tactics need to be tight and your responses need to be on point. I supremely enjoyed the mutations of the aliens throughout the different stages, and thanks RocketBear Games very much for the review copy. I am extremely glad Infested Planet came out of Early Access with such success. This is a game that truly needs to be experienced. As you pit your squad of marines against the ravenous hordes, you will find yourself cheering them on and even mourning their little pixelated deaths.Gameplay:    Controls- 8/10    Fun Factor- 10/10    Difficulty- 8/10    Replayability- 10/10    Innovation- 8/10Aesthetic:    Graphics- 7/10    Music- 8/10    Sound FX- 7/10    Story/Lore- 3/10    Level Design- 5/10Final Score: 74/100 for fun factor, replayability, and difficulty.Summary: An absolutely massive RTS about five space-marines eliminating thousands of aliens.Verdict: Infested Planet will please RTS fans as well as anyone that enjoys truly strategic gameplay.Full text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-infested-planet/Full gameplay/review video:

Short and sweet, later missions and weekly challenges are both brutally tough but instead of making you quit in rage they beckon you deeper into the game. Simple but fun. Expect it to go on sale next week(20% off for launch from $14.95). It's worth it now for less than a dollar an hour AT LEAST. You will want to replay it and the dev isn't greedy. He plans to add more after release and expansions are likely. 8/10 for the price.			"

												A fun game with infinite replayability. Each map is randomly generated (with the exception of the campaign missions) with a starting point for your marines and however many alien hives you need to stomp into muck. As you go through a mission you need to decide how to invest your resources on the fly. You can upgrade your soldiers with different weapon classes such as flame throwers, shotguns, snipers, or a towable med station; or you build structures that enhance your soldiers with regenerating health and grenades for crowd control (which do come in handy). Another way is to leapfrog with self-building siege cannons and turrets, great for decimating hives that are close together. It is important to plan how you want to tackle each map. After defeating a hive, the aliens will mutate and gain an upgrade of their own. This may range from a spore minefield to acid howitzers to heavily armoured defenders coming at you in droves. Outside of the campaign (where you purchase upgrades between missions,) the custom mission options are pretty thorough. You can pick what kind of map, how many resources you start with, the number of hives and their potential, and more. This is great for testing out different strategies or throwing difficulty to the wind and crushing the enemy under your cannonfire and airstrikes.Bazically, if you like slaughtering near infinite numbers of aliens and adapting to the evolving horde, then I highly suggest picking this one up.

The mechanic of giving the aliens new abilities as you capture their points keeps battles interesting all the way through, and the ability to fully recycle resources allows flexibility so you can try different things without getting locked into a hopeless situation.  The lower difficulties are enjoyable, and the higher difficulties are challenging, yet possible.  A weekly challenge adds a psuedo-social aspect to the game.			"

												Pros- Good replay value, the mechanics are much like starcraft but much simpler, the difficulty is challanging and losing feels justified, units feels balanced, the game forces you to have stragety and leaves you feeling satisfiedCons- the story is interesting but feels lacking, the game requires you to think rationally or you will die a lot, The game may make you wonder what the alien's perspective is and their motivation throughtout the gameIn conclusion, this game has a great starcraft feel to it with a difficulty that will both irriate you and leave you feeling smart. The units themselves are well balanced and force you to have stragety rather then just spaming one particular unit. However the depth of the characters left me wanting more and I also felt I wanted to be apart of the alien's view as well.All in all, this is a great game that is both unique and visually pleasing. And if you enjoy playing games like starcraft but mass aliencide in the thousands is more up your alley, then this is worth every penny! 5/5 stars			"

												I saw a promo video for this when it was in beta and decided I'd go over my limit for the number of early access/betas I buy into. That is a choice I've not regretted, there's been a great suggestions thread on the forums thats worth a wander through to give you an idea of what has been developed off the back of community suggestions and how willing the dev is to consider ideas.At first glance it's a fairly simple squad based rts and it is just that. However there are mutations to consider and those are randomised so each hive you capture you have to adjust your tactic to counter stuff like longer range on enemy turrets to different alien types. Another simple mechanic but one that can sometimes turn a map from a walk in the park to more of a fight.Alongside the campaign, which has good variety in the missions being done, are skirmish modes and weekly challenge maps of differing difficulty.

												If you like the free game ""attack of the paper zombies"" (http://www.indiebird.com/blog/?page_id=376) you'll love Infested Planet (IP).I think of IP as a roguelite RTS. You control a small set of soldiers, vie for control points with an AI alien swarm enemy, get awarded resource points, spend then on your soliders, or use them to build base defences or support for your team. If you dont like how youve spent your resource points you can refund them instantly for full value (which means you can try multiple tactics without penalty - I think this is better than what I recall in AOTPZ). As you capture more contorl points and push back the aliens the remaining ones get random upgrades which dynamically makes them harder to fight, meaning you might need ot change your (previously) winning tactics - its a great mechanic.Its expertly put together, featuring a campaign (with fixed maps) and two different types of randomly generated skirmishes with varying difficulty.  Controls, graphics, animations, etc are all great. My only criticism is the wording of the ""single mission use"" unlocks - these actually appear to unlock a ""single upgrade"" for use on any mission - making them much more valable than what I understood them to be (I thought it was use it and then lose it). As it was, I played through the game without them, which was much harder than it would have been with them.			"

												100% recommend. This is a game with a singular vision - RTS tactics versus an alien horde - that is executed perfectly. The UI, the graphics, the carefully crafted difficulty curve, all combine to make a game that feels like the platonic ideal of TACTICS. The campaign grows in difficulty in a way that forces you to learn and adapt your strategy, and the core gameplay loop of attack, stabilize, repeat remains consistently satisfying. Each step up in difficulty demands more efficiency and mastery of your tools while feeling relatively fair. There's a lot of content if you find the gameplay compelling. A decently long campaign teaches you how to play reasonably competently, and random levels stay fresh with the random enemy mutations that occur as you capture territory during the level. There's also the now-customary feature of weekly challenge levels with leaderboards. "

												Whut Up Whut UpHey Guys, So Infested Planet, looks pretty fun eh!? Well it is, sometimes it gets alittle cut and dry waiting for the masses to be triggered, alot of the ""customization"" as far as shouldering weapons for your soldiers are nice, however the game does seem to get ""complex"" as you may have to rotate soldiers for various insects that come out of those things, i like games like this, just sometimes they are hard to get into, the UI could be alittle more helpful in its notifications of things but all in all its an interesting concept, i would reccomend this game to you if your looking for a real Squad based challenger that involves more thinking than brash actions.

Then when you capture bases or crates, you get points that you can either use to buy weapons for your marines or build defense (Turrets).

												Great indie gem that is easily worth the price. While the strategies to win the game aren't especially deep, it is fun unlocking more advanced tech as you go and reaching that point of having access to the best weapons, buildings, and abilities. A great strength of Infested Planet is how adaptable your forces are. You can swap the weapon type / class of a soldier (or even dismiss a soldier) at any time without losing any permanant resources (if you swap to a cheaper weapon you get a refund for the difference, etc...). This applies to auto-turrets, mine fields, buildings, etc... as well. Often times the aliens will spawn a mutation that forces you to react by changing your squad loadout on the fly, so it is great that the devs allow you to do just that. It is a game that rewards both light strategic thinking and quick tactical decision making on the fly.The only thing that would make the game better imo is some kind of RPG system where your squad members could carry over between maps. With proper management they're no more likely to die in this than they are in XCOM (abuse that teleport!). As it is your squaddies are entirely generic from map to map and even death to death. If nothing else, a neat touch could be keeping count of how many aliens a specific marine had killed in a battle / campaign :)			"

												Phenomenal game! I discovered Infested Planet from a YouTube video and dropped the few bucks it cost instantly. It's simple; however, that doesn't mean it's easy. It's also addictive as hell. I love the resource management/RTS elements of this game, along with the unique ability to ""trade"" in your troops for BP points, which allow construction of buildings, or vice versa, depending on the flow of battle. I'm strongly considering getting the DLC game too. It's like Starship Troopers on crack. A swift testosterone shot in the arm, and a gem every RTS fan should play!			"

												Even if I cannot properly play RTS due to frantic multitasking, I enjoyed the first missions of Infested Planet. It's hard to do a fair review of the game since the pressure was too hard to actually explore all the options the game had to offer (unlike classical TD)One interesting aspect of the game is that the alien nests have spawn blobs and tower with a visible range, so if you're cautious enough, you may approach your target being undetected (otherwise, a steady flow of critters will converge to you).Another design aspect of the game is that the alien behavior clearly looks like liquid flow, so it sometimes appears you're dealing with rivers going wild (or plumbing issues). I feel there is some kind of hidden gameplay here, but wasn't able to access it.All in all : a good RTS if you appreciate being pressured from all sides ;)			"

												Incredible game. Pretty simple on the face of it. You kill alien hordes that look like gigantic insect colonies. Imagine one of those solo Starcraft II missions where you're a small band of marines going around and killing bases. It's like that but a full game built around it.This game isn't too hard but some of the hardest missions will put you up against literally thousands of creatures inching their way to your base. Dying is the result of either poor management or overzealousness. The game is mostly about controlling the flow of ""insects"", demolishing bases that create these creatures, and preventing your base from being overcome. Infested Planet does a good job of slowly introducing new gameplay mechanics and features. The variety of missions is pretty enough. Simply hearing the sound of a hearing an alien base explode is entertaining enough.While pretty fun from start to finish the final levels can get a little redundant. I wish the game really pushed it to the extremes even though it's already quite the beast. I haven't yet played the DLC, but I look forward to a Steam sale in the future. I hope a sequel is in the works with even more badass enemies and military classes.			"

												A very fun and tactical RTS. Command a group of soldiers against a practically infinite horde of alliens. You have the advantage of technology, firepower and a tactical mind vs ridiculous numbers. If that premise sounds great you should be buying this game now.The game is more about tactical combat and less about resources, you can always salvage whatever you have used and get something else to switch up your strategy if the current one isn't working and your resource cap is always the same, so you do not need to worry that much about experimenting with different unit types. Still the game provides a challenge, the alliens get more varied and with upgrades of their own to keep up the pace with your troops, occasionally throwing special enemies at you as well to keep you on your toes.Definitely the most tactics oriented RTS I recall seeing. Graphics are great and do their job, gameplay is quick and smooth in easy missions and a gruelling slow trench war in the harder ones. There's both challenge here and satisfaction in outmanuevering and destroying a more powerful foe.Very much recommended.			"

 Really fun RTS  This review is based on the base game and the Trickster's Arsenal DLC This game is pretty fantastic, it's really unique and fun. It feels very good to take over a base, destroy aliens with airstrikes and much more.   The goal is to destroy and replace all the enemys bases (hives) with the space marine-guys own bases. To your help you have:  Buildings  that can be placed anywhere on the map, for example siege turrets, usual turrets and shields.  Abilities  which are temporary benefits like a cluster-grenade attack and 4 riflemen that can be dropped anywhere but last for 30 seconds.  Tech  , which mostly are upgrades to the soldiers, like grenades and and spawning at the front instead of at your own base when they die and more. Weapons  that you buy for one specific soldier, and are permanent, for example flame throwers, sniper rifles and miniguns. There's also some nice advantages that the soldier gets with the weapon, like a personal shield or invisibility.   There's two different resources in the game - BP and ammo. BP's are earned when taking over the enemy's bases or getting specific crates to your own base and are spent on tech, buildings, new mariens and weapons. Ammo is slowly regenerating, but can be instantly gained from dragging ammo crates to your base and is used for temporary abilities, mortars and the marines rocket launchers does also use them.   The amount of different tech, weapons, abilities and buildings means the game allows for many different tactics and play-styles, and since there isn't a punishment for refunding the things earlier purchased, one can change the tactic completely mid-game, for example from like two guys with three of the very effective siege turrets to four guys wielding miniguns and throwing grenades.   All this stuff might sound a bit over powered, but the aliens does also gain some really nasty stuff, called ""mutations"". Cloning marines when they die, increasing the damage and range of their turrets a lot and spawning some really tough aliens that then settle down and in turn begins to spawn regular aliens, just to name a few.   I think that this - overall - is a really good game, and I do also recommend the DLC if you like the base game.			"

												It's a pretty fun game for those that like an action/defense style shooter. You control a squad that you can upgrade, and you have to attack these hives and capture the areas they are on top of. You can build turrets and tech centers as you purchase them and get build points. And overall its well made.			"

												""I guess people really like this game, as it has great reviews, but I just don't get it.  Maybe I'm missing something, but there doesn't seem to be any real strategy to it other than to keep moving forward.  Was I drunk?  I'm not really sure what happened, but I didn't enjoy this game.""That was my old review.  I wasn't impressed.  After reading from user Anathema that I should try the Skirmish rounds, I did just that.  They are where it's at.  The rest of the game is, as was mentioned, seemingly a tutorial and really not fun.  The Skirmish modes are great.			"

												Definetly one of the most refreshing, straight to action, rts out there. No base building, resource gathering, just simple action with upgrade. A mix between, Doorkickers // breach n clear and the constant aggression from creep world or dont starve.You must think tactically, but it aint turn based. You must establish a constant defense, but it aint tower defense either...There is no unit bond like Xcomm, instead there are upgrades for more unit weapons and stuff you can build in maps (turrets etc)I seriously recommend this game for rts fans and people interested in challenging games. This game's difficulty scales amazingly well and its achievements are actually fun to accomplish.			"

												Whut Up Whut UpHey Guys, So Infested Planet, looks pretty fun eh!? Well it is, sometimes it gets alittle cut and dry waiting for the masses to be triggered, alot of the ""customization"" as far as shouldering weapons for your soldiers are nice, however the game does seem to get ""complex"" as you may have to rotate soldiers for various insects that come out of those things, i like games like this, just sometimes they are hard to get into, the UI could be alittle more helpful in its notifications of things but all in all its an interesting concept, i would reccomend this game to you if your looking for a real Squad based challenger that involves more thinking than brash actions.

												Very fun top down strategy game. It teaches you how to be patient and weather out an alien assault before counterattacking with as many marines as you can spare to take out an alien hive, providing a new line of defence against the rest of the hives.The campaign is enjoyable, adding a variety of missions and the ability to slowly purchase upgrades to your army as you progress. If you're not a fan of doing the campaign, then the skrimish mode allows you to fully customise the alien menace as well as your own starting equipment. From having increased alien spawn and speed, to having them be more deadly but a lot smaller in numbers, and maybe more focused on defence.			"

												This was a great deal of fun if you really enjoy the tactical RTS genre. You command a squad of 5 or so marines that try to accomplish certain objectives, usually capturing alien bases, as you capture bases or capture resource crates you can upgrade your marines to different attack types or build upgrade buildings (equivalent of researching upgrades).  It was a lot of fun figuring out the mechanics of the system and how to manage your resources, then trying out different tactics to capture the alien hives (bases).  As you progress in the game, the aliens 'mutate' different abilities to keep you on your toes. If you are not paying attention that 'burrowing hive' ability may have popped up a hive behind your front line and is now in ur base killin ur barracks.  If you get really stuck, you can buy upgrades to start with for a single mission with in game money. I kept playing after I finished the story campaign to knock out all the acheivements. All in all roughly 25 hours of play, including farming money to tackle the last 'Raid' mission acheivement. A few quick tips for the later levels after you read the guides. Try to always attack hives with at least one Flamer in the group One officer and a minigunner are REALLY handy for tackling late level raids/missions where hives are clustered 3-4 at once. Keep moving one to the next. Keep the mini focused on the hive, it will eat through any shielding easily, while the flamer distracts the towers, and the marine(s) protect the mini.  Don't be afraid to switch your classes around, change them to scout to sneak really fast to a spot (Like back to defend a base), then switch them to minigunner or whatever.   Keep an eye on your map and the mutations in play. Be ready to defend against burrowers, or tower spawners, or if you see a squad of clones/mimics be sure to change one of your people to a sniper (for Minigunners) or scout.  Life support > Medic pod. Medic pod only heals ONE person at a time near it, Life Support for only one or two points more heals EVERYTHING (buildings) and everyone.  Marine>turret. If you need to defend a spot, try to use mines. They never run out, and are effective against almost EVERYTHING.  If not, use a marine, they are much more versatile.  Turrets are expensive and die quickly in middle/late levels, you better have Engineering to autorebuild it by then.  Engineering is a tactician's dream. You can pop offensive mines, build or recycle anything, anywhere on the map.  In EVERY game mode other than raid, take advantage of the fact that the hives won't mutate until you start capturing. Go sneak a scout and steal all the crates, kill defenders with grenades, if you die, keep inching the crates in and then switch your scout to something else before you begin your attack.   "

												I bought this game during the steam sale not really expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised at how deep and difficult the game is. The game plays like starcraft tower defense games of old. With you micromanaging a team of units to go kill towers that spawn enemies continuously. You upgrade your guys and build things to make the killing go  easier. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from such a cheap game but the final few missions were very difficult.After getting past the somewhat janky interface to move your units the gameplay blends pretty well. I wish there was a minimap so that I could get a proper birds eye view of the battle field rather than needing to zoom out. The game does have its issues though, Money is not all that important once you've purchased all the upgrades since you would only spend it on consumables. The shotgun is also exceedingly strong and works for pretty much every situation so there was little desire to go beyond officers and shotguns when deciding your team buildup. The enemy also gets random mutations which make certain fights easy and certain fights tedious.However despite all the issues the game is solid and if it was on sale for as cheap as during the steam sale definetly look into buying it.

												I've been playing this game since a very early beta and have watched it change and become the glorious game it is today. Everytime I play I get a new mix of mutations and have to change my strategy on the fly. Love the feeling when a hive is taken down and I start to make some headway.Lot's of strategic planning is required and each new situation throws up tons of options. The latest patches have introduced weekly challenge maps with three levels of difficulty so we can all compete on a global leaderboard.It would be cool if we could share maps from the skirmish mode with other players and compare scores, maybe a feature for the future.All I can say is if you like strategy and rts games that give you time to think and don't rely on twitch reflexes give the game a go I'm sure you'll have a blast and find a new gaming addiction.

												This is the game I have been waiting for.This is a game made by people who stopped and thought about what makes games good... and what doesn't.  Nothing unneccisary was added; no gimmick mechanics, no ""surprise!"" changing of the rules.  Everything is straight forward, in your face, down your throat awesome.This game is made of win.What you can expect:A game that plays by the rules.  HARD rules, yes... but still, by the rules.Progressive difficulties that build on what you've previously seen/learned.Devs who give you the option to play like a pro... or grind out extra cash for that edge you might need for your inner casual to sit back and kill some pixels.No shoe-horned solutions (see below)This game is the perfect mix of frantic and tactical.  You'll find yourself pausing, issuing orders, and then madly darting around the screen trying to handle three or more fronts at once as a new mutation puts you on the ropes.  And no matter how bad it gets, no matter how harsh the mutation roullette wheel grinds you down... it's... still... fun.So how many ways can you skin the provervial cat?You like cannons?  Build cannons to hold back the horde while you slowly chip away at them.You like deep strikes?  Build helicoptors and double your ammo supply to nuke bases with three consecutive waves of heli-strikes.You like tech?  Build some healing pods to keep your troops up.  Hell, son... let's stick some tech IN our troops and make them faster, stronger, better... that's right, the 6 BP Man!You like fighting swarms with swarms?  Make.  More.  Troops.  Make ALL THE TROOPS!  Don't even spend money on guns, just make... more... troops!  And then LET LOOSE THE HOUNDS OF WAR!And all of that?  Those are just SOME of the ways I've beaten... THE SAME LEVEL.  That's right... any tactic you can afford (BP's pretty thin if you don't think things through)... can be made to work.  In fact, that tactic you just tried and failed?  It might just be you went in the wrong order.  Did you spread yourself too thin?  Forget to backfill some defenses?  Did you recycle your old swag and move it forward?  Oh... did you get that one mutation you don't have defenses for?  Well... TRY IT AGAIN!I rarely rave over a game... but in the last few years I've seen so much schlock, so many shiny letdowns... to have finally been given a chance to enjoy game that doesn't 'try'... it just succeeds.If you like real time strategy games, go find a Let's Play for this game.  I'll bet you press the buy now button before the video's over.  I did.  And I have no regrets.			"

The gameplay mechanics are absolutely fantastic and make you feel like a god, as you push your men up and kill millions of little bug things. The story is fairly simple but it's engrossing enough to be enjoyable. the cons of this game are few and far between, but the main one is if you get stuck there isnt much you can do to advance, but this is overcome by the ability to play a different mission and get powerups that way. all in all its worth a buy for about 6-7 dollars if you can get it on sale, but i dont think its worth the full sale price as it stands.

												This is a great game, probably my favourite RTS. Solid gameplay where you take a squad of marines around destroying aliens and their hives, but combined with some tower defence elements where you protect your own bases or the chokepoints leading to them and upgrade your abilities. The interface is crisp and well thought-out, it's well-balanced with the marine types and upgrades, and it's kept interesting by the aliens mutating to adapt to your tactics, but you can also always recycle everything to change your tactics accordingly. It also has great sound effects. Tactical and fun - you can't go wrong for the price.			"

												I had played the predecessor to this game before, ""Attack of the Paper Zombies"", and enjoyed it a lot despite me not being a big RTS fan. I couldn't really stand the slower pace of most RTS's, so the faster pace of this game is probably one of the main things that drew me to it. In ""Infested Planet"", you command a squad of soldiers and try to destroy alien nests, reclaim bases, while at the same time protecting yours. You will aquire ""BP"", which you cans spend on upgrades for your troops, build structures to assist you, or add more soldiers. Levels start out realtively easy, but quickly become more frantic and crazy as the game progresses. Besides the campaign, there are also weekly challenges and randomly generated levels of varying difficulty. There is a bit randomness to the game that forces you to think on your toes, while not feeling unfair at the same time. All in all, for a game still in Beta, I've been having a ton of fun.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot! It's really exactly what it promised in the trailer. I don't think it's worth the regular price but in sale it's a good buy. It really had a Starcraft-like Terran vs Zerg vibe, down to even the loading screens being very reminiscent of that series. Didn't bother me, but it could bother others.Pros Fun gameplay, requiring tactical decisions Easy to pick up, no steep learning curve Upgrade system with valuable upgrades that change your playstyleCons Few things are actually explained decently. For example, I didn't know snipers were a good idea against towers, as they are ""advertised"" as being good vs units but can't damage structures. I didn't like the graphics, and they weren't very diverse. There's a green and a purple palette and that's about it. Dialogue wasn't voiced and that gave the storyline characters a trivial feeling. It felt like they were there to give some diversity and reasoning to the maps but I really didn't feel invested in any of the characters. In fact, that leads to my next point.. The storyline isn't so good altogether. I won't spoil anything but it's nothing spectacular The game gets pretty tough later in the campaign mode, increasing difficulty by creating ""unfair"" advantages for the enemy player. I don't think that's the right way to increase difficulty. I would have liked to see more diverse monsters or challenges in the landscape. This game lacks online co-op play! That would've been awesome.  You should definitely pick this up if the trailer appeals to you gameplay-wise. Other than that there's not much more to be found in this game, but that point alone is good enough to carry it to a positive review! "

												Nothing short of amazing. Infested Planet is a great mix of strategy, story, and difficulty. Although rough at the start, it soon turns to a challenging and unpredictable game. The feeling you get from playing is something you could never expect from a real time strategy. Amazingly difficult at the end too, I'm still working on that.			"

												If you like casual gaming then you will like this. Its not a game that you would play for hours upon hours at a time, but in small amounts (10-50 min) it is very fun. The campain is average and the story isnt that great, but Skirmish mode is the best part of the game as you can customise your starting troops, turret power and even the amount of enemies there will be. A great game if you like strategic challenges that you can try time and time again and still lose hopelessly. So in ratings out of 10Story 5/10Campain 6/10Skirmish mode 10/10Overall 7.5/10			"

												Squad-based-mini-rts-swarm game that simply delivers.The player has a significant choice of tactics, depending on his style of play and the situation. And the situations changes dynamically.The enemy, a quickly mutating alien swarm, has the unpredictable ability to generate different abilities when you strike a blow at their hive. Different mutations can form a deadly combination, which will force you to quickly rearrange your plan to be able to hold your ground.At the point of this review I have played 14 hours, 12 of which on the Skirmish mode and each game delivers different experience.It nudges you to plan, adapt and think on your feet. For a casual game where you can dive for a 20 min game, it is extremely well done. You can see the polish in the little details, animations, and lack of even minor bugs, which many AAA class games have.I recommend.Also, keep an eye out at Alex. This guy seems to get what game balance means in each form of the phrase – fun, choice, fairness, reward.			"

Not much strategy involved, other than protecting your structures with turrets and killing high priority targets before they spawn more enemy bases. Other than that, nothing really.Pros+ Fast paced+ Simple, bare minimal strategy+ ""Bought when it was cheap""Cons- Boring- Same enemies- Same situation - Same tactics- No real challenging strategy involved- Boring graphics, on par' with creeper world- Not worth at full priceConclusionIt's worth the price, ""IF"" it's reduced. Don't buy it at full price as with most iffy quality games. A simple shooter, team, strategy base game. Nothing more than that, no gimmacks, nothing special about it, same old boring, bare bones hat tricks. Stay AWAY if it's full priced. "

												More a tedious, stressful and relentless masochistic experiment than a true entertaining game.All is : ""find the way mission is supposed to be played to win"".As mission start you have to RUN with the proper sequence / build order in order to succeed.So you have to fail / retry as long as you don't find the way it supposed to be played (AKA puzzle game and not RTS).Simply NO FUN. You have no freedom in your playstyle.Sorry but Fun is the major reason to play games for me. Challenge ? Oh yes ! But don't mismatch challenge with stressful punishing experience.The more you go into campaign, the less flexibility you have in your playstyle.Do this quick, do that now, click here and there NOW  or 'the doctor will die' etc... No creation, no self decision, just execute the proper sequence. Pretty decent graphics and atmosphere, but a true deception for me because its lack of fun. Overall : 4 / 10			"

												So what is Infested Planet like?It's rather good. It mixes squad based tactical gameplay with somewhat conservative base building RTS, and throws in swarms and swarms of aliens.


YouTube™ Video: Infested Planet - Mac Gameplay 

			Views: 264		

			An indie tactical squad based strategy game, where you fight off swarm of aliens. Click Here To Subscribe  http://bit.ly/19ksM1a Infested Planet  http://store.steampowered.com/app/204530 Twitter ...		

The game starts you off nice and easy, and then quickly progresses in difficulty. Sometimes getting you stuck because you happened to spend build points on the wrong upgrade or building. Before you realise it you're bang eaten alive by a swarm of alien larva.It's very fun, and it's rare for me to sit down and just play a game for over an hour these day, before wanting to do something else.Focussing mostly on your small squad of tactical marines, it can become very challenging juggling between them for attacking, defending and trying to do some base building at the same time.Upgrades are essentially, and the game has a very simple and nice way of managing them. They're acquired through plain old money, earned through missions. Which are either Story based ones, or Random missions, that only seem to serve as ways to get money and much needed upgrades.I would easily recommend this game for people that like squad based RTS games, and it's as close to a Starship Troopers squad RTS as you're going to get.

												New Review 20 March 2014: I didn't think it was fair to keep my old review, nor fair to the players to read the old review if it was no longer relevant information. I will, however, keep it on here as a reminder of how far along Infested Planet has come.Infested Planet is a top down RTS game that combines mobile tower defense with a king-of-the-hill aspect. The development team has come a long way in a short time (a few months) since my last post. They have been doing a lot of hard work to create a challenging and fair environment for the players.The later missions are very difficult, putting your knowledge of the various units to the test. In order to complete them you will have to combine a number of different tech buildings and unit types in order to overcome the various enemies.In-game unit details are not amazing, but they are informative. When you hover your cursor over a tech it will give you generalized information on what the unit does, including the hotkey it is assigned too. For instance, the officer unit tells you that after 'destroying a hive units gain %200 attack speed' but it does not tell you how long the buff lasts. You'll just have to become familiar with the units yourself, knowing their capabilities.When completing missions you will be awarded cash/credits/money based on a set value or a number of factors including how well you did. This cash is used in the out-of-game shop menu in order to purchase different tech/units to use in game. The shop also has additional units or unit buffs for the next match you play, increasing your chance of winning by giving you more/better units.Skirmishes are now balanced and fair for the player. The new code checks the map for specific variables which gives the player a fair start. This allows for a challenging experience from beginner to master.Over all, Infested Planet has come a long way since its beta period.8 out of 10.-KamlynOld Review: Infested planet is not a bad ""flash game"" because that's basically what it is. You play top down and control a squad to defend points and take points, much like king of the hill meets mobile tower defense. It's not bad, but I honestly think it needs some balancing. The randomized skirmish maps can easily make completing it a piece of cake, or a two hour long slug fest which results in a loss. I find a lot of the ""Research/Tech"" buildings to be completely useless, costing too many bonus points in a match to really be able to build unless your steam rolling in which case you don’t need them anyway. Without purchasing ""Free Buffs/Units"" from the shop the later levels are extremely difficult to complete which is good if your looking for a hardcore challenge. Infested Planet is regularly patched but is considered a final release, so small things will change here and there. IMHO, I also think the ""Free Buff/Unit"" shop purchases need to be removed. Maybe an experience bar instead of a cash inflow to unlock your research, this way there would also be no excess ""money"".-EDIT: After additional playing and reading of others reviews and partial guides (aka. better explained unit abilities, which I think Infested Planet needs a complete page for itself. Properly explaining units and there abilities full effects) I conclude that with proper use of units and strategy can lead to a satisfying result (A win, or a ""did-your-best"" loss).-EDIT 14 Jan 2014: There has been a change in the unit lineup. Your all useful medic has been removed, and this techno box thing with medic capabilities (which can be towed by a unit) has replaced it! The Medic Box costs 5 BP instead of 6BP, making it cheaper, but I find that it is: much easier to destroy, increases micro required, and even further decreased my enjoyment of Infested Planet. The medic was replaced by the officer upgrade, and I find that it seriously lacks. The officer inspires your units to do better by moving faster. he only increases your units rate of fire IF they KILL A HIVE. Why doesn't he just give a passive bonus since he's inspiring them? If you cant tell this is a bias edit. I really enjoyed the medic as a unit and now I'm left with this easy to destroy thing. FIXED-BUG: Don't forget to change your hotkeys otherwise you won't be able to quickly build the Medic Box. Even after setting my hotkeys I couldn't easily build it, and was FORCED to left click the buff... -EDIT 28 Jan 2014, Patch 14: With the new patch 14 out it gives me some hope. Although I have not yet had the time to play around in patch 14, it looks as though it has fixed a few issues I had been having with the pervious partial patch. Will update post when I've had a chance to play.-EDIT 20 March 2014: So I took a vacation from Infested Planet in order to allow the Dev's time to implement a lot of patching instead of one or two and ranting on a small change. As a Dev has so graciously posted in my review I would like to go over the recent changes which has made me enjoy Infested Planet more than I previously did (See beginning of review).8 out of 10 stars,-Kamlyn			"

												Infested Planet was a mildly diverting RTS-lite game with that age-old science fiction narrative about space marines killing alien bugs on an unforgiving uninhabited world.Yes, I played the campaign all the way through. Yes, I beat the bugs. Yes, I had fun... but I wouldn't recommend you spend the money to have the same experience.While the variety of upgrades and abilities available in the game was interesting and diverse, the combat pacing and the manner in which you had to almost constantly be pushing for new capture points in order to a) actually achieve anything other than a gooey stalemate with the bugs and b) actually gain the resources you needed to buy cooler toys for your grunts meant that I figured out one or two pretty comfortable strats about halfway through the campaign and... just didn't feel the need to experiment. Scarcity of resources and a high value placed on individual marines means that your options are pretty limited; turrets simply weren't cost-effective in my experience so most of the time I stationed lone rifle marines at choke points while pushing hives with the remaining 4 or 5 marines that I actually had resources to buy better weapons for. Gameplay was a little tactically rewarding, but gets a little stale when it's almost the same scenario over and over and over and too many of the enemy ""mutation"" modifiers are just frustratingly unfun.Go ahead and give Infested Planet a chance if you want, but my personal recommendation is that you go play StarCraft again instead.

												Great game and potential to refine itself and improve once it is 'gold'. This satisfies that whole Alien/starship trooper feel of those handful of marines against a swarming alien menace.The difficulty still needs work, mostly in regards to BP costs for your upgrades and buildings. BP too low, costs too high, and the BP you acquire is mostly static in each mission. Which makes later games all the more harder, even when those missions will already provide enough challenge with its 'mutations'.			"

												Great game and potential to refine itself and improve once it is 'gold'. This satisfies that whole Alien/starship trooper feel of those handful of marines against a swarming alien menace.The difficulty still needs work, mostly in regards to BP costs for your upgrades and buildings. BP too low, costs too high, and the BP you acquire is mostly static in each mission. Which makes later games all the more harder, even when those missions will already provide enough challenge with its 'mutations'.			"

												Infested Planet was a mildly diverting RTS-lite game with that age-old science fiction narrative about space marines killing alien bugs on an unforgiving uninhabited world.Yes, I played the campaign all the way through. Yes, I beat the bugs. Yes, I had fun... but I wouldn't recommend you spend the money to have the same experience.While the variety of upgrades and abilities available in the game was interesting and diverse, the combat pacing and the manner in which you had to almost constantly be pushing for new capture points in order to a) actually achieve anything other than a gooey stalemate with the bugs and b) actually gain the resources you needed to buy cooler toys for your grunts meant that I figured out one or two pretty comfortable strats about halfway through the campaign and... just didn't feel the need to experiment. Scarcity of resources and a high value placed on individual marines means that your options are pretty limited; turrets simply weren't cost-effective in my experience so most of the time I stationed lone rifle marines at choke points while pushing hives with the remaining 4 or 5 marines that I actually had resources to buy better weapons for. Gameplay was a little tactically rewarding, but gets a little stale when it's almost the same scenario over and over and over and too many of the enemy ""mutation"" modifiers are just frustratingly unfun.Go ahead and give Infested Planet a chance if you want, but my personal recommendation is that you go play StarCraft again instead.

												Probably the best game I have bought this year.At first it was nice to play, but as you get to the harder missions the game constantly keeps you on edge, it is very difficult to gain the upper hand against the aliens and also to successfully keep it. The struggle to match the alien mutations and suprise attacks can take a long time. But the game does not punish you too hard if you lose a lot of ground, often you can regroup, recover what you lost and still score a satisfying win in the end.Reminds me a bit of Starship Troopers. Very enjoyable.			"

												Mindless killing of mindless hordes if you want an evening of mindless (not some much you do have to think a little) gaming. But seriously it’s what it says on the packaging, you grab a squad progress through the level, normally destroying alien nests while killing thousands of bugs who want to eat your squad. Between missions you upgrade your squads gear, new weapons or options and progress to the next level. This is one of the games where you want some fun but don’t want anything serious (detailed background, griping story, open world etc.). If you want a game of that elk, then this is for you, if you want something with a bit more up then seriously consider the purchase, thumbs up from me!			"

												Great game, fun & juicy aesthetic with solid mechanics/game design.Some puzzle/small scale rts/tower defense+offense mechanics.Each level you're attempting to solve which troop types/buildings/tactics will work against the situation. You must do this through spending your command points on upgrades/troops etc. The thing that makes this game so fun & better than the others in this genre is that anything you buy will be refunded for 100% of the purchase value (in command points) .... so just because you've made a bad purchase, you can still come back and recover provided you haven't lost a bunch of bases and cascaded toward failure too far. This rewarding of experimentation provides the same level of strategy/tactical thought as other games of smiliar genre ... but you just end up having to reset the game a lot less. "

												I'm convinced that most real-time strategy games shouldn't bother with an actual lore and storyline. The ones with better storylines usually crib their source material from conflicts in history, and I usually gloss over those because there's a sense of THIS IS ROOTED IN HISTORY, IT'S LIKE I'M ACTUALLY THERE via gameplay (what I like to call the Saving Private Ryan approach). Beyond that... oh Christ. The Dawn of War series comes to mind as my first go-to answer for why RTS games shouldn't bother, largely because Warhammer (40K and otherwise) is a gigantic batch of poorly written juvenile♥♥♥♥♥♥with all the depth and appeal of a moody teenager sitting in a dark room slapping the dolls from all of his Collector's Edition video games together. (""Anything by Blizzard"" is an immediate runner-up, mainly because Blizzard rips off Warhammer lock, stock, and barrel and any attempt I've made to read any lore for one of their universes made me wish I hadn't.). Infested Planet ALMOST sidesteps this.Infested Planet is a wonderful distillation of the real-time strategy genre. It pares the structure of a typical RTS down to a few buildings, a few soldiers, and the ability to instantly change your soldiers and abilities on the fly. The enemy is entrenched and reacts to upgrade itself, and sometimes you'll find that the strategy you're employing won't work at all in the face of shielded buildings and mimic squads that copy your squad exactly to kill your own soldiers. And even if the enemy succeeds in kicking your♥♥♥♥♥and taking your bases, you can refund your previously built kit and try a new strategy. The enemy captured your siege cannon? No prob, just switch a grunt from a sniper to a scout and have that scout weaken the building while the rest of the squad puts lots of bullets in it. Want to destroy a series of hives and then set up an area to protect your new base of operations? Go with an officer and four minigunners, kill them all, then switch to shotgunners and flamethrowers and spend the rest of your resources on defense encampments. It's a wonderful game that allows and forces players adapt to unforseen developments (and there are plenty of those that the enemy is willing to pull out in order to destroy your dumb little squad of soldiers).If you're going to play it, however, I recommend that you play the campaign up to a point, because that's where the game keeps the 'random' missions. The campaign is almost where I fell out of love with Infested Planet. Not just because I have to play something I don't want to play to unlock features inside the game, but also because the campaign's learning and difficulty curve moves up too slowly, and it also keeps taking away the focus from the free-wheeling dance of terror with a plodding story about an army that invades a bug-infested planet and then the planet fights back and then the bugs kill the army and then the stranded sexy female scientist pulls out a bioweapon and the big bug hivemind is destroyed in the last mission and it is told with the same amount of care and excitement employed in this run-on sentence. A lot of the included campaign is boring and stifles what makes this game great. Infested Planet doesn't need a campaign mode and a cast of characters talking over soldiers shooting alien bugs to 'flesh out the lore' (but if the developers insist, get someone who can actually write this sort of thing). Infested Planet's magic lies in its skirmishes and random missions.			"

												Simple, yet incredibly addictive to play. Starship Troopers the RTS, really. Having resource claiming as opposed to resource gathering and 100% recycle refunds puts all of your tech at your constant disposal and makes adjusting to new conditions on the fly easy, as resources spent badly can be instantly recycled and redeployed somewhere else. The game has that inexorable onward march pace you expect from the videos on the store page, sometimes it's not so much fighting enemy units and bases as preparing to arrest the flow of a river. Would pay for further campaigns and game mechanics in some form of expansion.			"

												Exceeded expectations. There's something about it that feels lacking, perhaps different playable races are needed, and the graphics are pretty mundane. But its a very solid game for what it is. The gameplay is fluid and balanced.I love the way resources don't expire and only need time to respawn. It takes the stress out of losing units, but balances it in a way that doesn't make it feel casual.			"

												If you like difficulty over actual content.  if you have unlimited patience to play the same missions over and over again.  if you like being spread to thin  and have so much going on you dont know where to begin. then this is the game for you! its not a good game for me however. i  stopped ejoying my self around mission 5 and just spent time getting money. and dreading the next mission.  so much so that i will simply not play it anymore.  i got about 6 good (enjoyable) hours i payed 7.50 if it dosnt add up to at least a dollar an hour of enjoyment then it wasnt worth the money.

												I was teased with the idea of it being a heavier blend of RTS - The levels are lacking and the gameplay becomes very tedious after a while.What makes matters worse is that all of the money you earn in game is spent solely on expendable items, making all of your progress mean nothing but a full map.

												A great game that I cannot reccomend enough. I bought it on a whim this afternoon when I wanted something new, and Steam recommended this based on a game I've got nearly 300 hours logged on (100 in the last 2 weeks). I've basically played this for 6 hours straight now, and if I didn't have to get up for work in the morning, I'd probably do another 6 happily.Interface is so intuitive that there's virtually no tutorial. You can look key bindings up and there are tooltips on controls that tell you them too. Its a game thats fast enough to keep your brain active, but laid back enough that you can watch or listen to something else at the same time. Some missions are randomly generated, so that gives a lot of replayability, and there is a great spectrum of difficulty and types.The basic principal of every level is ""destroy the bug hives"", but so far I've hit 3 principals. One is your standard story mission, not much to explain there, its the plotline. The second is a kind of time trial mode - you start with a clock, when it runs out, you're done. The more bugs you kill, the more you get paid. Every time you take out a hive, you get more time, and if you clear them all, then you get bonus pay. The last type is a standard annihilation mission, but almost every time you take out a hive, the aliens mutate (effects are very varied, from upping their counter attack speed when you take a hive location to aliens that spawn towers when they die, hives fighting back directly, etc). So far, I've not even cleared the second tier of that level because while an individual hive isn't too challenging to take down (though it is a real meat grinder), its when you hit groups of 3 hives at once that things get interesting. I've sent air strikes, cluster bombs and my entire squad at them and the best I can get so far is a meat grinder where neither of us win.Best money I've spent on a game in a long time.			"

												This is one of the games when I hope that Steam would have a third option between recommend and no.The game has good ideas, and was really enjoyable for the first half. However, the difficulty curve for the campain is badly designed. It went from enjoyable to crazily difficult very fast. I don't like the resource system of this game. It really limited your options as you approach a mission.			"

												It is not complex enough.There is a recipe to win and once you discover it, you apply it over and over on each fight.The only improvements you can do is to optimize your time.The Planetary Campaign expansion is overpriced considering that you receive just 3 units. The campain layer I would say it is a good addition to the game but I would not play it twice. It reminds me to the Crown and Council game.			"

												Good game - well executed, for the strategy lovers out there. The mechanics do a good job of challenging you right to the end of a level, and punishing you if you overreach, but also letting you revise your strategy through a mission as needed so mistakes are frequently recoverable. Another game that stayed enjoyable right through to the end.			"

												OLD REVIEW: This game feels like a really lite version of Starcraft, which isn't a bad thing.  It's really easy to pick up, and is a lot of fun. I'd thoroughly recommend it for full price. If it's on sale, it's an even better deal.I've been reworking some of my reviews, to be slightly better. As you can see above, my original review was pretty uninformative. So when I think of this game, I think of it as a Starcraft Lite. What I mean when I say this is Starcraft is a very skill heavy RTS game; it has kind of a high skill floor. Infested Planet does not. It's a top down RTS that's very simple. You start with a base and a few marines, and some money to spend on the marines or your base. Your objective is to capture all the points on the map (usually, campaign stuff varies). You'll have to kill the bugs in your way to do that. To do this, you can upgrade your units via indirect upgrades (buildings that upgrade your marines) or directly upgrade your marines. You can spend money to change your starting marine from a marine to a flame trooper, or a scout, or a shotgunner. From there, you can send your marines to their death, just to have them respawn in roughly 10 seconds. Your army constantly replenishes. If you have 5 marines, and they all die, they'll respawn at the nearest control point after a short timer. They keep their classes and everything. So marines dying really isn't that big of a deal. If you also decide you don't like building A, and you don't like that the one marine is a flame trooper, you can refund both, and get all your money back. The game is very flexible, in regards to what you can quickly do to change your strategies. There are also commander abilities you can use by using commander points. Commander points slowly come back, or you can pick up items in the game that refresh it. The abilities all do different things, like a helicopter strike. All of them can be incredibly useful, depending on your end goal. This game also has dlc that adds some more abilities for you to use. I bought it for $2.50 and it was totally worth it. If you want a simple but fun RTS, I'd highly recommend picking up this game. It's a good bargain at the price.			"

Was able to kept me interested for hours.You have tons of strategic options to play, but just the right amount of resources (I'm lying...you will be always missing 1 or 2 points to create the killing strategy) and will cry to hold grounds.Sometimes you will be winning easily and thinking you are the best, but 3 guardians hives will make you step down and cry like a baby.Worth a try.

												A game with simple controls but with a very steep learning curve. Generally very entertaining as you get right into the action. The marines are all very versatile as switching classes is easy, but choosing the right roles can be a challenge. Also, aliens are really relentless so keeping your guard up constantly is a must in this game. I really recommend this game as there are a lot of varieties to how you adapt to various situations.

HOLD THE LINE!!!' or 'What the heck did that wee freak do?  Are they all armoured?  How fast?' till there's a little something left over in your brain that says, 'Dear Satan they're coming and there's nothing that's goign to stop them this time... nothing...'This has given me so much satisfaction and so much joy as a tactical top-down strategy game that I have reinstalled it over and over.  I just have to keep going back to it.  And that, for me, is the standard of an EPIC game.  It does look pretty, but keeps it simple, the soundtrack is limited, but then that's alright - you really won't be paying that much attention to the music, and the engine is smooth and robust, especially given how many units can be on the feild at any one given time with a dozen mutators all in effect.Get this game and prepare to have your own Aliens / Starship Troopers 'They sucked his brains out' experience...FOR REAL!  ;)			"

												Being a big Starcraft 1 fan, This game gave me back the hope that blizzard had crushed. That and this game hasn't tried to pickpocket my credit card so major plus there!-----------The has a feel of starcraft but it's a game of it's own.It's a simple real-time strategy with elements that have a homely feel to it, there is no real base building or resource gather instead you capture infested bases which in turn give points, these points pretty much are your resource which you can use to buy marines, turrets, perks, etc.Sorry for not giving a complete review as you can see I haven't played much of it(I'm lazy, I'm ADD and I sleep more then play games lol, that or I'm busy moderating my friends stream)Once I beat the game I'll give a better review.+--------+Downvote me if you think I'm handsome ;3			"

												Considering that the sight of the ocean fills Kiwi with mortal terror, he has never actually seen a surfboard, let alone gone surfing. What research Kiwi could bring himself to perform suggest that this game is quite an accurate simulation of the sport of surfing. As if maintaining balance to avoid the ocean's deadly embrace isn't enough, there are the varying tides and many tricky waves that will try to pull you into the abyss. But to merely survive is not enough, you must also out-do your fellow aqua-braving madmen in what death-defying stunts you can do on your sliver of safety.As you progress through the games story, even more dangers are placed in your path: sharks, other less alert, but infinitely better balanced surfers, and your own mermaid clones. The latter, Kiwi assumes, is the result of the mermaids stealing your DNA during one of your many ""wipe outs."" Some may suggest that it'd be more appropriate to call them mer-people, but that's silly. Any one who's studied the English language knows that the correct way to refer to the collective of them is ""mermaids."" Their ability to clone you implies many unpleasant things about the aquatic civilization, not least among them is a lack of laws against identity theft. Unfortunately, these implications are not explored in the game's story, most likely the developers plan to revist it in the sequel.			"

												I only recommend it if you can get it for less than 10$. Nice concept in general, a mix of RTS and tower defense.  But it does get quite repetitive over time, especially since theres no multiplayer option.Also it needs a lot more balancing, some weapons and tech are either totally overpowered or totally useless. Also at the harder difficulties its basically luck that decides the game, since the monsters can get random mutations that make it either insanely hard (I was close to hitting the game delete button in frustation a few times) or just plain boring...

												There is a TL;DR (too long, didn't read) at the end of each paragraph.The Game *campaign*: starts off pretty good. Small tutorial basically tells you to take your guys, move them forward, kill stuff. easy matches no problem until right around mission 7 - 8 regardless of whether it's a story mission or the random missions,♥♥♥♥♥♥goes to hell way too quick. You go from: Oh hey, this is easy im having a good time to: wait what the ♥♥♥♥? Why can't I kill one building? Why is everything dying? I built everything or upgraded everything and im still getting pushed through? The difficulty goes from 1 to 100 way too quick. Some missions, if you don't build PERFECTLY or follow a strict guideline you WILL fail. Some of the alien mutations become WAY too hard to fight. It would probably be better if you gained Build Points over time, or if they gave you more for doing certain things, but overall this game sucks. There's no difficulty settings, and some missions litterlly depend on RNG. Whether or not the AI wants to send massive amounts of aliens to kill you, or just sit back and wait while you slowly struggle to kill the bases. Whether they get insane defensive mutations, or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones like visible landmines that any solider can destroy at any time.TL;DR:- Campaign goes from easy to bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy way too fast -- No difficulty settings -- No room for error -- not enough resources - The Units Part 1: Starts off with rifflemen, which can take care of pretty much everything unless there is a giant swarm of somekind, and not so great against buildings (turrets). The shotgun guys come in on mission two, which makes crowd control SO much better and a lot more fun, but in the same match you notice something that will cause you immediate brain sufferage, Turrets. High range and damage, never miss. But here's the thing. They Also do damage over time AND SLOW DOWN your units movement speed. TL;DR- Fun early game crowd control units -- ♥♥♥♥ turrets -Upgrades part 1:At this point you're probably thinking, well how bad could it be? first mission *mission two* with turrets, I only lost a guy or two, and i get infinite respawns without consequences, it's fine. The game brings you to your first screen in-between missions where you can buy upgrades. The Very first thing I notice? ""Single Mission Exhaustible Powerup"" I'm like wait, the first thing I can afford is something that ISN'T permanent? Not only that but I have to rebuy it regardless or whether or not i pass or fail the mission? (these upgrades also cost more over time - like say if you have an upgrade to start the match with 1 shotgun guy who replaces a riflemen, but you don;t buy it, the price of said powerup increases mission affter mission. Starting cost is 2800, but near the end of the campaign, these one mission use powerups costs over $40000) The second thing in he menu that you can buy costs almost twice as much as what you can afford, which is a decent upgrade. allows you to build portable healing devices. But still, no artillery units.TL;DR- Single Mission Powerups that cost more over time and can only be used once - (THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN VIDEO GAMES)- No artillery units -Mission 3 (Upgrades part 1.5):Seriously, they could have just put this in the previous mission. They introduce the first ability to destroy buildings, the ""launch rocket"" ability. Able to be used by any soldier. You have a certain amount of ammo (10) these rockets cost 2 ammo each. One is enough to kill a turret, and ammo can resupply over time OR you can grab ammo crates lying around. Not much I can complain about with this one. The range isn't OP, you still get hit at-least once or twice before using it. My complaint about this comes at LATER levels of the game where the rockets become almost useless, especially when enemy bases developpe certain mutations like shields. We get more one mission upgrades and one more permanent one, again, costing almost twice as much as what we currently earned, TL;DR- Introducing rocket launch -- more one mission buffs - The game goes on repeating this cycle, over and over. with little variation to units and upgrades. The difficulty however changes drastically. The aliens get stronger and stronger, their bases are more and more defended, while you get little ot not resources to compensate. At this point the game introduces ""mutation"" as I previously mentionned earlier. Which as I can observe, the aliens gain bonuses from what you destroy (♥♥♥♥ed right?) The more buildings and nests you destroy the STRONGER the ENEMY gets! What the♥♥♥♥♥♥kind of sense does that make?TL;DR- Mutations: You're playing good? Having a good mission? let me fix that.To bring this whiny post to a close, this game has GREAT potential. It has AMAZING potential. but somet hings need to be either reworked or changed. Simple as that. The upgrades are♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need better late game tank units.			"

												It's a damn fine game made by a hard working dev. You spend your time running around slaughtering semi-defenseless worm creatures as you get payed cash money. Use that money for upgrades and perks etc. Not a whole lot to the game honestly but one that I will gladly stand by!			"

At a stalemate, you continue to poke and prod. Maybe a sortie to grab that metal or ammo in the field will be enough to take more ground...You'll figure it out.			"

												Dynamic Strategy/Tower Defence at its finest!Strategy and Tower Defence fans will love this game. If you are a fan of either I say to you: BUY this game right now! I've purchased many games that have either failed as a Tower Defence game or a Strategy but often mixing them both has been downright rubbish... Take creeper world for example. Overly complicated for very little satisfaction. Too much emphasis on complexity which creates the difficulty rather than the challenge itself....I often steer clear of strategy games; overly complicated upgrade systems and zerg rushes...Finally a game that throws you straight into the flurry without over complicating.A game doesn't need to be extremely fancy to succeed.... It pulls off all aspects of design near perfectly.Gameplay 10/10Graphics 8/10Audio 7/10Polish 8/10Once I complete this game I look forward to Infested Planet 2.			"

												Good game, but gets too hard and since missions tend to be quite long, it's frustrating to lose a mission time after time at the final moments. Because of that I have no motivation of starting a new mission anymore, knowing the mission is propably going to prevail.Well anyway; I got halfway through and as I bought the game from sale at 5,66€, I consider it well worth the price. I will be coming back to this game.Also the game could use somekind of game speed  management, I was actually searching it for a while since it seemed so obvious to me that there would be one.EDIT ; Also the game REAALLY could use saving function during the missions. After 3 attempts on a mission that lasted 60 mins each time, I just could make myself start it from the beginning again.EDIT 2; since last time I edited this review less than week ago I had 8 hours of this game played. Now I have played it 52 hours. Addictive game. Got through the hard stage and since that everything went smoothly.			"

												I can only recommend this game :) It's a awesome mix of tower defence and attack. Build up a small base and defend it or use all your points for more offence power to overrun your enemies. You can also create custom games with own settings. Starting points, difficulty, available tech, available alien upgrades, map size and shape.The Story mode offers you a lot of random missions to collect money to buy upgrades for all the mission or some mercenary for the next mission only. Do you like tower defence + huge amount of aliens + upgrades + fighting back,  BUY IT! ^^ "

												Nice idea, but I'm not that pleased with execution. First levels is like ""I just order to attack"", then later levels goes ""just watch how they kill you"". Feels like something is not working... I bought buildings, which should give me healing, granades, turrets... nothing happens. And I have no money to spend on marines, so I walk with common guns, looking out for these granades and healing... but there's nothing. (Most expensive) Minigun guy looks nice, but can't handle wave of enemies. Everything is covered in poison, slowed, so when you choose command to ""1 shoot rocket at enemy"", EVERY marine is literally DIVING in sea of aliens, because no one has the range to shoot. So you choose to back off, but (poison & attacks) they cant really move. Okay, then simple attack and watch. Auto-attack with basic stuff like on tutorial. Something isn't working...Game is really nice BEFORE you hit medium-late levels, where you should turn into Tibetan monk			"

Infested Planet is a pause-and-command real time strategy game, a very dynamic and mechanically unconventional one. You start with a bunker and a team of soldiers, fending off a gazillion of buglike swarming aliens who succesively come up with accumulating dreadful capabilities emerging every once in a while. You can build further grand and minor structures to enhance your fighting force with an array of manifold remedies, hire or dismiss additional units, upgrade soldiers to weapon or function specialists, call in attack reinforcements and gain other aid as you proceed through the battleground. When needed, you pack up your stuff and move forward, regaining resources required for further expansion.You need to adapt, as enemy will also react with some impacting edges in response to your actions. The combat conditions constantly evolve. In the campaign, for each succesful mission you earn money, for which you can buy better war technology and single stage various mercenary support. The only hotkey you need to assign is the pause button, which I recommend to go spacebar with. Mind also such utilities as fire rockets, recycle and select all units. Move and attack may be useful likewise.With the Tricksters Arsenal DLC, unique abilities come to your disposal, allowing to pull off maneuvers otherwise beyond reach. The contents of Tricksters Arsenal is available for free in the Weekly Challenge mode, where different formulas of play can be found, such as survival mode, capture missions of pillar difficulty levels, as well as the ultimate challenge of Ironman. I highly recommend to start the experience with the basic version of Infested Planet. Planetary Campaign DLC introduces an entire new level of strategical management, along with a basket of significant battleground innovations.Infested Planet is a polished product, very well done. In all my lasting adventure with it, I have found only few buglike looking occurences, which have been dealt with in the manner of days directly following their report. The developer - RocketBear - is very responsive, socially open and engaged in the project, which is to be appreciated nowadays.The basic score is 8/10 wHATs grade plus one extra point for the developers attitude and the quality of presented work, which makes it 9/10 wHATs grade. Taking how rough the gameplay can get, minding it is a precise strategy coming to tactics genre, I can recommend Infested Planet to those who feel like doing this kind of digital entertainment. The STEAM price is adequate, though 12,99€ would look better.Infested Planet is fun. It is very likely to stand the test of time.			"

												I want to recommend this game, but at the same time I can't recommend it.Pros- RTS without mining for currency- Cost me about $5 with the DLCNegatives- Hives randomly spawning under you- You upgrade your marines and when they die, the computer will spawn a duplicate of them for themselves, yes the computer will copy your upgraded marines once they die, you had a flame thrower that died?  Now the computer has a fresh flame thrower.- Same thing goes for turrets/siege towers- Double costs of towers, you pay for the tower, and then there's the privelege of paying to use the ability of the tower.- Grind, grind, grind- If you're crazy enough to beat it, there is ZERO replay value.The difficulty ramps up on each mission the closer you get to completing it.  You destroy part of the enemy base and the enemy gets a mutation that makes the mission more difficult but it stays somewhat balanced, however at times the computer goes into cheap mode and spawns a whole lot of crap out of nowhere.On the final mission there is no such destroy mechanic.  The computer gets mutations based on time, so the first one at 10 seconds, next at 20 seconds, and so on and so forth meanwhile you are barely getting by until eventually you become overrun at which point you need to grind previous missions to get money to give youself extra resources for that final mission.All of this translates to frustration and a huge waste of time.  I loved the game, but that last mission alone turned me off so much that I have digitally ""binned"" this.			"

												It's fun until you play for a while and realize that it has one problem that is common in many indie games because it is obviously a tough thing for indie devs to program correctly: difficulty scaling. The SP campaign doesn't take long until it requires insane amounts of micromanagement that will put even Starcraft 2 to shame. It goes from being a good challenge quickly to holy fk I have to sit and redo this to beat it how many times? Until I figure out exactly what to place, where to place it, and when to place it, basically follow the devs set path they obviously had in mind and don't deviate a bit? That or lower the difficulty to easy and be made to feel like a b-tch.I mean other than that it seems like a good game. But not $15 good more like $5 good.			"

												Don't let my ""not recommended"" discourage you too much. It's a cool game, but it's not for me.My biggest issue with it is I found it difficult to play, and I found it difficult / unintuitive to adapt to or understand what was going on. Maybe the strategy involved more micromanagement than I'd like. - Even maxing out the ""buy bonus help for this level"" didn't give me an overwhelming advantage; so I'm not particularly good at this kindof thing, and/or the game isn't particularly easy like that.It's still a cool kindof game, and reminds me of the likes of Starship Troopers.

												Infested Planet ramps up in diffuculty way too fast , the pause button alleviates this a bit so you can think but with the endless stream of trash coming your way its easy to forget what the goal of the mission even is or worse your guys cant clean it up fast enough and gameover. Most people online from what I read gave up on the mission 'preperations' I myself barely beat it bercause the monsters go berserk and gameover in like 10 seconds if you dont have turrets up. another bad point of the game is something called mutations after you capture some enemy points the aliens (Locals) get mad and zerg you or recieve some other buff. with all their buffs on they can be unstoppable. I dont think they get any weaker as they recapture their hives either so its pretty much game over if you werent ready in advance. If it werent for these flaws I would easily recomend this game to friends. Space run is what I recomend instead of this unless its on sale than be prepared for headaches and reading forums on how to beat a mission.			"

												Infested Planet is a very entertaining game however there are game impeding technical problems with it. The worst of them is the dead scroll keys at random times. Specifically, randomly in the middle of the mission, the game would refuse to let the player move up or down, thus making the game impossible to play. Also, the game would sometimes lag probably due to too many enemies spawned. This should not be happening with this type of game at this level of graphics. Optimization in the code is needed.			"

												it is an ABSOLUTELY amazing game, but i feel that is significantly overpriced.It will no doubt give you hours of fun, but so will other games (even franchises) that don't reach the pricepoint that this does.Not to mention i bought it to play on my Windows 8.1 Atom baytrail tablet, which can run Crysis, Battlefield 3 and 4 (extreme mods) but apparently the minimum requirements even if surpassed by the device can't run this game smoothly. The author deserves applause for making a fun game that can take away hours of your life, but there are definite compromises.			"

												If you like difficult micro-management in RTS games this game is great. Otherwise I won't recommend it. You are knee deep in aliens and unless you plan very carefully after level 4 you'll get swarmed... over and over again. Definitely not a game for me.			"

												I purchased this game late in the night, which may have been one of the reasons why I bought it in the first place. If you are thinking about buying this game late in the night, just wait until tomorrow morning and make your decision then. You are better off that way. --Longer reviewI had the strong craving for a new strategy game and came across Infested Planet. Initially I was skeptical of the game, primarily due to the poor graphics, however I did not want to spend more than $20 tonight, read a few of the reviews and also looked at the gameplay... and thus I bought it. The beginning of the game reminded me of some flashgames over at armorgames.com, only that I am not playing the game in the browser. I went along with and played a few of the missions, which were fairly easy until the levels substantially increased in difficulty. I don't dislike difficulty... unless that is the only thing that drives the entire game! Granted, you have some buffs and upgrades, but every mission is the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing. It's like playing skirmish, while increasing the difficulty of the AI every time you win. The story itself is rather uninteresting and after reading 2 of the messages, I just skipped through the rest of them, as they just became a nuisance.Ultimately, I would only recommend this game to those who... screw it, I don't recommend it at all. If you are into RTS and strategy games, then I rather recommend spending 25$ more to purchase a copy of Wargame.			"

												I got a 75% off this game's price coupon and I said: ""What the heck it looks good."". So i got it for 3.75 euro and firstly I liked it but then after some missions the aliens become too overpowered after 5-6 minutes of playing the certain mission. They become so strong that you can't beat the mission. This game is extremely unbalanced and I don't recommend buying it. Unless you're somekind of a pro and manage to beat the game. If they nerfed the aliens then the game would be playable again and I'd recommend it but untill then DON'T BUY!!!			"

												I don't like it. The graphics are cancerous and the gameplay is annoying since the ""enemy"" is like a stream of water comming at you. The way to beat it is kill the stream faster than it gets produced and kill the production source. While you have several methods to do that, this basic principle is the whole game. If they add multiplayer or different quest goals, i might change it to thumbs up. But for what it is right now its way too repetetive.			"

												I've enjoyed this game but I've noticed that a single map can range from easy to impossible very quickly depending on a number of uncontrollable things. There are certain weapons and structures that make winning significantly easier and there are certain mutations that make winning almost impossible.Getting the wrong combination can turn any game into an un-winnable stalemate. I've rarely lose a game but there have been a number of games where we reach an impasse because I don't have the tools I need to win and they can't break my defenses. Maybe that speaks to my lack of skills but it does make the game a bit frustrating because I know I need to reroll the scenario and hope for a better combination.I like the game; just realize that this is a game meant to be played, not to be beaten.

												Absolutely love this game.  Did not understand the concept even after reading a couple of Reviews but after about 2 min of playing everything becomes clear.  From there you get a Mix of Strategy and Tower defense.  What is awesome is that the mutations really change up the game to the point that one strategy will not work consistently throughout the game or throughout the mission.   It is the first game where I have really found myself painted into a corner barely holding on testing multiple different strategies just to be able to push them back.  It also flips fast where you think you will have them beat and then in seconds everything crumbles and you are falling back trying to contain them.  Great game.  Hopefully they keep expanding it			"

												This is small, and simple, but very very fun.Reminds me of the old game Gauntlet that I played on the C64.Based on Starship Troopers, it is deceivingly addictive. While the early levels are quite easy, the difficulty racks up nicely, and the top levels, while they can be done, they are a challenge.With weekly challenges at different levels, and random skirmish levels, there is a lot of replay-ability.I personally have played over 20 hours of Infested Planet, and will keep going back.Recommended!

												One of the best games I've played this year. The gameplay mechanics are very solid and satisfying. The game can get pretty hard in later levels as the enemy racks up mutations but that definitely adds to the tension and struggle in a positive way. You get tons of options in terms of upgrades and strategies and you are never punished for your choices since everything is always 100% refundable. I do wish there was co-op, but maybe for the sequel.			"

It remind me of playing Enzo's Survival maps back in Warcraft 3, but deeper.Infested Planet is a fantastic strategy & tactics game, controls are similar to most RTSes but the gameplay is not.  It's all about an intense tug of war game between you and the alien bugs over control points on the map.  You and your small squad must try to control a map against thousands of times your number.The challenge is legit (infuriating at times), the fun is fairly unique, the price is very low.

												While potentially frustrating, this game has been nothing but a satisyfing challenge.  With no ""exact solution"" to every level and plenty of upgrades to mess about with, a few five or ten minute missions can turn into a three or four hour session without too much effort.  Graphically, the game is alright, seen better seen worse.  The UI on the other hand his quite nice, with everything you need to know tucked around the border to give you as much vision as possible. The enemy types are rather nicely varied, and easy to tell appart at a glance, which is glorious.  Though I do wish there was a bit more of them throwing varying enemy types mixed together.  For fifteen USD, its very hard to go wrong with this one.			"

												A very interesting take on the real time strategy genre, Infested Planet eschews the building of extensive bases and farming of resources to speed up the maps into small, 5 - 10 minute frantic bursts of action. You have six marines to control and they are all the units you get. As you progress you unlock air strikes, new weapons and buffs, and defensive turrets to build. In the first couple of maps, it's very simple: Find the enemy and shoot it. Once you have some missions under your belt and the game starts to alter the rules on you, battles become chaotic, and desperate, contests of survival.There is surprising depth here, and the game has random maps to keep things interesting. There is no multiplayer option, but for a something that doesn't require a large time (or money) investment, Infested Planet serves well as a quick fix for fans of rapidly played real time strategy games.

												Several years ago I played a cool game called Attack of the Paper Zombies. It was a free strategy game I'd read about somewhere online, where you play a small band of marines tasked with wiping out alien zombie ""hives"" (control points), but with each additional point taken, the hives mutate various (random) abilities that increase the challenge of further progress. Apparently, this game was popular enough that the developer decided to quit his day job and focus on further developing and polishing his game for commercial release. Infested Planet is that game.I won't go to in depth about the game itself (special thanks to filly73 for seeing it on my Steam wishlist and gifting it to me), and while I didn't really notice that much ""different"" about the new game (other then the changed art style, better graphics, background story, and such), when I went back and played the original again, I realized that a very significant change had been made, that significantly increase what I found the most enjoyable about Infested Planet—basically, the removal of any penalty for changing your strategy…Basically, every time you capture an additional control points, you gain additional ""research points"" with which to either increase the number of ""mercenaries"" you control, upgrade those mercenaries with a variety of weapons, or build offensive/defensive structures such as automated gun turrets, or unlock various effects to support your control point–capturing efforts. While many of these features are nearly unchanged from the original Attack of the Paper Zombies, the significant change is that in Infested Planet, there is no cost to ""recycling"" any of these upgrades. Spent 4 Research Points on a gun turret, or on a flame thrower for one of you mercenaries? Recycle it, and get back all 4 points to put towards some other upgrade, whereas in the original game, you'd only get back 2 points. In my opinion, this change not only made the game more ""fun"" (you can experiment with different strategies without incurring any penalty), but also allowed opened up the option for employing strategies that DEPENDED on repeatedly changing your arsenal, something that would have resulted in attrition in the original.TL;DR: A fun strategy game that allows a great deal of variety in how its challenges may be approached.

												Infested Planet is an awesome small-squad pausable RTS.  On the lighter levels of difficulty, it's fun seeing how quickly you can plow through the alien horde.  On the harder levels, grinding is rarely the way to go and you're rewarded for changing up your strategy to meet the current situation.  An amusing campaign and several random map generation options keep it entertaining.			"

												This game is pretty fun. You control 6ish marines going on a shooting spree on an alien infested planet. The swarm of aliens gains mutations throughout the game to make them more difficult to kill, and the marines get better weapons/tech to make them better at killing.			"

												A fun game that plays like a high action version of a focused RTS/RTT where you control a handful of marines and build support structures to slaughter the endless tides of xeno scum in the name of the God Emperor...wait different license (but there are definitely echoes of space marines vs tyranids here!).   Has a surprising amount of depth and challenge at later levels as you unlock more research upgrades and the swarms mutate into varied and agressive xenoforms.   Even though its still early release, it feels like a complete game if not particularly long.   Great value for money.			"

												This game was well worth the money. Shooting down hordes of Aliens while simultaneously strategically defending and attacking certain points. My only issue is that the difficulty ramps awkwardly. It goes from extremely easy to very hard quickly, forcing you to purchase (with in-game money, no dlc BS which is nice) extra units or buildings prior to entering a level in order to complete it.

												A lot more strategy in this game than you'd imagine. It's quite an intense game to play and feels a lot more like a strategy game than an arcade game. Lots of fun slaughtering thousands of aliens at a time. The campaign levels are designed, and are a somewhat more interesting than the random levels - which is a tad annoying when you want to retry it and it's randomised again. A random level could be easy, or insanely difficult based on the layout you end up with.			"

												Tight, focused, exciting gameplay.Graphics are crisp and bright and tell you exactly what's going on, while being full of style.  Menus, character portraits, and icons are all expertly made.Perfect UI.  You can zoom as far as you want.  Everything has a shortcut, they're visible in-game, and they're on the left of the keyboard.  You receive appropriate alerts, and the range and orders of every unit can be seen.  Everything about the UI says ""oh, they thought of that too"".Mutations and upgrades keep things fresh.  Try random missions or continue with the story.  There's a ""daily challenge"" I haven't tried yet.  There doesn't appear to be an ""easy"" or optimal strategy.  Use what works in different situations.  Use the generous money you get from missions to buy new technology.  This game is excited to get the goodies in your hands.The gameplay is fluid.  You might be losing, badly; that doesn't mean you can't regroup and win.  Everything can be redone in the middle of a mission and early mistakes can be recovered from.  It's hard as hell and it can be frustrating.  But persevere and you'll break through.Very impressed with this game.  Paid $15 and have been absolutely delighted.			"

												This was a lot of fun for a few hours. I got stuck eventually, but that's probably not the game's fault.I love the degree of abstraction in the design. The relentless top down view is so much more useful than the usual isometric 3D mapped design used frequently elsewhere.The pause/command/run mechanic was perfectly thought out, with units responding intelligently to commands.I could have used a little bit more tutorial. I found out by accident that you can add another unit by pressing M, and that you can (have to really!) recycle units.Good fun.			"

												My score: 9/10An enjoyable RTS. It's kind of like playing Starcraft against the zerg. I appreciate that there are different strategies that you can play, and there is no one set way of playing the game ""right."" The AI mutates, which means you have to change your strategy on the fly, and you are able to do so because you can change character class, and buildings on the spot. The game is fast-paced, and there's no resource collecting.Some problems with the game though is that it can be rubber-bandy. You take over one spot and another one gets taken over. You retake it, and the enemy regroups somewhere else... Another problem is that the 'tidying up' phase can be a bit drawn out. Not so bad that you're looking for one peasant hiding somewhere in the fog of war, but there's a point when you can say: ""I won already, c'mon...""Pros:Various strategies work equally well.Fast-paced.Good variety of buildings and character classes.Feels good gunning down waves of aliens.No grinding or other time-consuming activities.Cons:The game is a bit short. But it has decent replay value.Graphics could be better.Controls are not as precise, or snappy as I would've liked.Excellent game, worthy of it's price tag, and an even better deal if on sale.			"

												There are not many games that can attest to what they say they are or can do. This game, however, is right on the ball. Waves of alien creatures in overwhelming numbers and every decision you make can and will affect the outcome of the battle. This is not a game that will be completed quickly and it will test you. It can be stressful, but when victory is yours, you feel so good because it is a difficult game. I only saw two videos, then bought the game and so far I'm getting my moneys worth!			"

												First impressions:  I recommend this game to die hard RTS buffs looking for something different.  I wouldn't call it a tower defense game though.  Although you do place some turrets at times, the game is more mobile and you keep moving from area to area clearing out bug infested buildings which you take over slowly turning them into bases to win the game.  At some point in the game after purchasing the buff, you can heal at each base.  You do not go inside buildings, just around them.  They all look the same and server one purpose.  To become another healing point for you once cleared.  You must clear every building to beat the map.This is like other reviewers have pointed out.  It is a very basic, repetitious swarm control game.  You are constantly controlling areas and trying to destroy the spawn points around the small maps as fast as you can.  As I said, the game is pretty basic and get repetitious fast.  One reason for this is that you will play the same maps over and over again to get money to purchase perks.  Some perks are permanent and some are one time use.  It is somewhat a grind-fest!The maps are different.  One reviewer stated it was the same map the whole game and that is not true.   They just look the same as the textures are not all that different.  At one point I found it harder to pass the same level than before and it was pure strategy.  I had lost my 3 shotgunners….  If you lose the soldiers that got the good weapon drops, they respawn with basic weapons again and makes it hard to pass beat the maps sometimes.  Don't lose them!  Heal them!This is just my first impressions and I might change or update this review, but as I said, the game is fairly basic and gets repetitious, but does have that Starship Troopers feel of being overwhelmed by aliens!  The game seems solid, polished and made with love of the genre.  So far I recommend it to RTS die hards only!			"

												Great game. The missions are quite easy in the beginning, but they get challenging soon enough.What I like:- Excellent mix of big strategy and small-scale tactics.- In most other RTS, there is a tipping point where you know the AI won't recover, so the rest of the mission (often a big part) is just clean-up duty. In this game, however, the aliens get stronger and more vicious the more you advance, so it stays interesting until the end.- You get a full refund for salvaged *and* destroyed buildings, so you can experiment and adapt during a mission. (Think ""control/supply points"", not ""money"".)- *Lots* of alien carnage - alien kill counts in a mission are typically >10.000 :)- Great music + sound effects- Overall, a very well thought-out game and UIBefore buying, I was a bit sceptical whether I'd like the visuals, but they actualy work out quite well in-game.The only downside is that there are only few actual campaign missions - 16, I think, including some very easy ones. But there are various random missions (at different levels) and weekly challenges that are a lot of fun on their own, so there's enough play time as it is.			"

												In a word: fun.if you like RTS games, then this is a fun, casual horde-mode RTS. There's not a great deal of base building, just strategic turret placement, and you don't really build an army so much as micro-manage a small squad.very satisfying watching all those little bugs die, but there's actually so many of them that if you're not careful you will be overwhelmed. they have more powerful units and defenses which you'll need to take into consideration, so it's by no means too easy, after the first few levels the difficulty ramps up reasonably fast, and as you go through the story you'll unlock more side-missions which are repeatable and randomly generated.9/10, not absolute perfection, but then what is?

												Where do I begin?Probably with how AWESOME this game is.The units are all very interesting and have different uses, none can truly replace any of the others except maybe the sniper and the chaingunner.The levels are all fun and a lot of them are ridiculously challenging at first. I'm almost finished with the campaign and I have to say, I'm enjoying the hell out of it. Easily one of the best purchases I have made on Steam. I somehow feel like this game reminds me of Creeper World, so if you to were a fan of that game, you may also like this. The horde physics remind me of the creeper.If you like squad games with a side of RTS and tower defense, then you will probably love Infested Planet!My only real problem is that the alerts for things going on sometimes don't catch my attention, but that's more of a design issue than an actual problem with the gameplay. If you're good enough you won't have alerts anyway.9/10, would buy again.			"

												I just bought a boatload of games during the steam summer sale and this is the one I keep coming back to. It's very fun and has a nice level of difficulty. You have many options how to tackle a mission but without being bogged down by any micromanagement whatsoever. You also have a ton of flexibility in how you play due to the ability to buy, sell, rebuy or change classes at a whim. The small group of marines you control really gives the feeling that each one matters and it's pretty neat to see what a single unit or two can accomplish. Very highly recommended. More people should know about this game.			"

												Incredibly addicting with a great learning curve, this indie game presents a challenging, although fair, experience for any RTS fan. Instantly one of my favorite games ever. By commanding a squad of variable size throughout random missions (although there is a story mode, and it is quite fun), the player is tasked with taking control of command points from a never-ending swarm of aliens. If you like Starship Troopers, you'll love this game. It has a few nods here and there and somewhat matches the feel of the film(s). I never noticed any bugs (outside of the endless swarm that you'll find your space marines constantly firing at) so it is a well-programmed affair. My only real complaints reside with the marines themselves, I do wish that they had proper voice-acting and dialogue. Like the marines of the earlier Halo video games, I think it would really spice up the experience. If there is ever a sequel, I'm certainly buying it. It'd be neat to see a CO-OP mode where each player commands squads, but it isn't terribly necessary. All in all, it's a fantastic experience that kept me enthralled to the point of forgetting to sleep. On a side note, I purchased this at about the same time as I purchased Dawn of War 2, which is another RTS. I can honestly tell you with complete certainty that I like this game more.			"

												Bought this largely because of the great reviews, and yes, it is that good. It's just the right balance of difficulty, where you don't feel overwhelmed but you will lose sometimes. And the thing about it is, the gameplay changes so much on the fly. A mutation of the enemy creatures will change the dynamic of the level, or suddenly they start sending a huge attack towards a lightly defended area. You also have a certain amount of 'credits', don't remember the actual term they use in game, that allow you to buy soldiers or powerups on each level. Because you can cash in units for a full refund at any time, that means that you also can change strategies mid-level when you see that a plan isn't working like you'd hoped. That is, you can sell cheap soldiers and equip your existing ones better, buy turrets with the extra money, or any other variety of different approaches.There are a lot of indie games on here with great concepts that suck because they have terrible execution. This game is the opposite - a concept that doesn't sound like much, but it's executed perfectly. I don't even usually like these types of games but Infested Planet is an exception. Outstanding game - if you're curious enough about the game to read this review, then trust me, it is worth buying.			"

												I didn't really expect much from this game, bought it in a sale, it seemed kinda interesting, then I forgot about it.Found it in my library recently, decided to give it a shot, got addicted to it! It's the kind of game that I wanted to play for a long time but everyone would always over complicate things or it would be a glitchy mess.No glitches found so far, you tell a unit to build, walk and attack, walk, or carry something. Every unit can do this, groups are surprisingly easy to work with and everything is nice and basic. There's no money, you have points that you can spend on buildings or troups that can be refunded, you can't lose these points, but you can gain points depending on the mission. Story mode was a joy to go through with interesting situations, the escort missions were done right (They draw a path and tell you when they plan to start moving, just clear it out and secure the bases around it, done!) Basic but interesting situations with adapting hives that change constantly to keep them interesting (Counter attack mutation always made things slightly awkward when capturing a new base, slow down poison made my army of flamethrowers struggle to get to the fight etc). It's a simple game, but it doesn't need to be any more then that. Really enjoyed it- looking forward to the developers next game!			"

												Nice game, I thought it would be a simples A-Move Terran vs Zerg game and it turn out to be more than that.I finished the story mode and beat Terminus and Iron Man with some strategies and planning. Iron Man is especially intersting, but after all the training of story mode and Terminus battles, I had little trouble to beat it.Overall it's very enjoyable to play.			"

												This game is a lot of fun.The only downside I see is that the difficult curve ramps up serious a few missions in -- you need to have just the right strategy to survive.That said, the ""you never lose resources, even when your units are killed -- you can reallocate them at will"" mechanics is frickin' brilliant.  So simple, but so fun!			"

												I'm actually not quite sure why I enjoy this game so much. It's like the Starcraft missions where you lead a few marines into swarms of melee-only zerglings, and the marines mow them down right & left while trying not to get overwhelmed.Likes:-- No diddling with resource harvesting: There are some resource & ammo crates, but otherwise resources come from capturing the enemy bases.-- Death is temporary: If a marine dies, they get resurrected after a delay.-- 100% refund on recycled buildings: Recycling one turret and adding a new one closer to the front has a net cost of zero.-- Small numbers on resources: 12 resources means one fixed turret and a soldier upgraded to shotgun. Once you get a few more resources, do you recycle that shotgun to build another fixed turret?This combination means you're constantly considering what the current situation needs and where to apply your limited resources. Which is nice.Dislikes:Really my main dislike is that unit subtleties aren't clear: it badly needs a unit encyclopedia. Is a normal marine effective against one of those bigger beetles with spiky armor? No--this is a useful fact to know, but the game doesn't make this obvious. There's a science/exploration theme to the campaign, so an in-game encyclopedia would fit. The tougher missions would be more palatable if I could regroup and figure out where I went wrong...but without knowing unit strengths & weaknesses it's tougher to figure out.Overall: worthwhile, totally worth the sale buy.

												Great game. The missions are quite easy in the beginning, but they get challenging soon enough.What I like:- Excellent mix of big strategy and small-scale tactics.- In most other RTS, there is a tipping point where you know the AI won't recover, so the rest of the mission (often a big part) is just clean-up duty. In this game, however, the aliens get stronger and more vicious the more you advance, so it stays interesting until the end.- You get a full refund for salvaged *and* destroyed buildings, so you can experiment and adapt during a mission. (Think ""control/supply points"", not ""money"".)- *Lots* of alien carnage - alien kill counts in a mission are typically >10.000 :)- Great music + sound effects- Overall, a very well thought-out game and UIBefore buying, I was a bit sceptical whether I'd like the visuals, but they actualy work out quite well in-game.The only downside is that there are only few actual campaign missions - 16, I think, including some very easy ones. But there are various random missions (at different levels) and weekly challenges that are a lot of fun on their own, so there's enough play time as it is.			"

												I wasn't expecting this game to be nearly as good as I found it to be. the campaign is for the most part suberb with a large amount of gameplay variety. The large amount of technologies available to unlock allow for alot of options and the shop allows you to purchase tempory buffs that last until one mission win, which makes getting stuck on a hard level bareable. The last couple of missions both random and story can be very frustrating. The mutation system causes the aliens to counter your tactics and can easy turn the mission un winnable. Earning money and keeping my buffs on surrendering helped negate this, but they were still a bare. The DLC adds some cool powers to use with ammo, but I feel its a little too much for what it does. Overall this is a great RTS that sould leave you entertained for a dozen or soo hours			"

												Really enjoyed this one. A fairly simple strategy with a lot more depth than meets-the-eye. While it does play like your standard RTS, you have a unique resource that once you have it, you can use it indefinetly. For example-- you can make your troops fast moving scouts, for 5 points and have 2 left over to change them again, into flame-troops. Then swap back. The resource never really ""burns away"" like in your standard RTS, it just takes new shape. So as your enemy uses new ""mutations"" (their version of research or tech) you can totally revamp your strategy on the fly.That makes the game a little out of the box. It's not revolutionary, but for the $4 I paid, it was well worth it.Only played through the story, that feels like maybe 1/3 of the whole game. 10/10 would type an over used ""10/10-ign"" meme again! (really tho, stop this♥♥♥♥♥♥is getting old son).			"

												How would I describe Infested Planet? Well it is basically the Starship Troopers films and animation in a nutshell. Your objective varies for each level; either being destroy all alien hives, survive, or escort. You, the player/commander, are given points (BP, the purple currency) at the start of each level and gain more for destroying hives, recyling buildings and units, and capturing boxs. The tools vary from support buildings or automated turrets. Your opponents, the alien scum, is well pretty dang mindless. They attack you on a path and can be stopped with ease. The basic ones anyway. They do adapt just so you know, I'll let you find out.Pros: Commiting genocide on alien scumOrdering your men to their immediate doom(But no in all seriousness)Good unit pathfinding <--- A+ (Is a must game developers, do not ignore this!)Unit variiety <--- units can be upgraded with different weapons and behave differently depending on weaponStrong replayabilityCompetent enemy AI <---- may not appear it but they are. Beware of certain mutation combinations.Cons:Lack of multiplayer.			"

												This game is unique and familiar at the same time. It feels like a warcraft 3 map with only heroes. You have a team of 3-9 soldiers that will go against thousands of  enemies, literally. The enemies are simple melee at first but develop much deadlier abilities later in the game or even later on the same map. To counter this your team can change skills on the fly to adapt to any situation. Because of this the game now oddly feels like a first person shooter where you can change from invisibile assassin to close quarters shotgunner to sniper rifle and then to flamethrower in just 3 seconds leaving behind assassinated enemy heroes, dozens of dead spitting aliens a destroyed tower and a burning building including the enemies in it. There is no limit to the changes you can make, marines can change an unlimited number of times, buildings can be recycled getting the full resources back, research and upgrades can be sold back as well. The only limitation is that except plain marines everything else uses resources and thus the number of upgrades that you can have at the same time is limited. Thus it is very important to determine which upgrades you need at a certain point in time and establish a strategy before you jump into combat. The game also features a pause button which I rarely use as i prefer real time strategy over turn based mechanics.You gain resources for captuing enemy points and dragging resource crates back to the bases you own. You do not lose resources when losing a point so while the progress may be slow and incremental, you definetly can try new approaches if you get pushed back after a point capture.There is definetly replay values with random generated maps and a ladder system that shows how well you did on a map as compared to other players. There is also a weekly challenge and a nice story mode with additional mechanics.I definetly recommend the game.			"

There's not a great deal of base building, just strategic turret placement, and you don't really build an army so much as micro-manage a small squad.very satisfying watching all those little bugs die, but there's actually so many of them that if you're not careful you will be overwhelmed. they have more powerful units and defenses which you'll need to take into consideration, so it's by no means too easy, after the first few levels the difficulty ramps up reasonably fast, and as you go through the story you'll unlock more side-missions which are repeatable and randomly generated.9/10, not absolute perfection, but then what is?

This is by far it's biggest strength.A great 30-40 min per session game.Lots of violence, lots of guns but with some definite tactics.You control a squad space marines against an alien threat. Each marine is more than a match for each alien, however there are hundreds of aliens - and only 5 of you!The AI is reasonably intelligent and changes it fronts of attack in a 'this makes sense' kinda way.If you want a game to quickly switch off from the world for 30 mins at a time this is a definite purchase.

												It's a great game, but has some game breaking issues and ballance problems in the later levels. Half of the upgrades arn't cost effective (per mission ones) and the buildings are pointless except the teleporter.It starts well, and the hardness increases to a point where it's more fustrating (due to the ballance issues) than fun to play.

												""The only good bug, is a DEAD bug!""-Displaced resident of Buenos AiresIn a game that asks if you apes want to live forever, all you can do is arm up and take it to the enemy. For such a small game, Infested Planet offers quite a bit of entertainment. It can be play in nice little 30-40 minute increments, or for longer stretches...depending on how many bugs you need to kill.It's well balanced, each map having a variety of different methods to victory. There is certainly no ""right"" build order, and the player is free to fight the way that they perfer. Additionally, the mutation mechanic ensures that you never quite get too comfortable.All in all, it's a good bit of fun.			"

What to pay : <10€.You play a mercenary commander aiding the army colonisation of a new planet. Unfortuantely, it has a bug problem.Infested Planet adds what most tower defences lack; actual strategy. Surprisingly well balanced, this game isn't going to punish you, but it's not going sit down and take it either. The 10 to 15 min missions and forgiving nature make this a very agreeable ""I only have a little while"" title.  You can even surrender a mission at any point and still walk away with a little of your merc pay. Some of the missions don't even need you to progress to make cash. It's a case of not dying.So what do you spend your merc pay on? Well, for a start, upgrades. The odd thing about them is that while many games do the same, the offerings here really give flexibility. It doesn't truely matter WHAT you unlock, but rather what you build on map. Even if you buy an upgrade you didn't want, no worries. You can't undo it, but you're not cockblocked.You can also purchase one-shot additional mercenaries. You'll never run out of things to spend cash on, nor missions :)My best tip : minefields are often a better choice than a turret if you can use it in a chokepoint.			"

												Pretty enjoyable game if you like to micromanage troops but not base build.The difficulty swings wildly at points but its never difficult, rather it seems to range from easy to somewhat hard.Once you figure out a build you like you can basically get away with using that build over and over.The game also lets you replay old levels to gain more points to level up/buy equipment. Every time you play a level it will be slightly different (with some levels being completely different each play through)Honestly I rather enjoyed it and it has high replay value.No multiplayer is a bit of a bummer but no big deal.

												Solid core concept, and with the recently launched DLC, it's more of the same thing, but in a very good way! The basic premise of Infested Planet is that you have just a small group of elite soldiers to battle through an endless swarm of aliens to destroy their hives and gain victory.The DLC (Trickster's Arsenal) gives you additional battlefield maneuverability (teleport your troops anywhere, call down temporary solider backups, etc) which gives a greater number of tactical options to utilise your ammo resource. At the same time, the aliens also get some new toys such as the hive runner which attempts to re-establish the hive elsewhere after you've destroyed a hive.The gameplay can feel slow if you are playing in the easier levels. To truly enjoy the intensity and the game's value, you need to bring on the pain and go Ironman Mode and play at the highest difficulties.The weekly skirmishes offer randomised maps and a scoreboard to see how well you are doing against other players, which provides great replayability value.I purchased Infested Planet a while back, but immediately purchased the DLC when it came out. I sincerely recommend this to anyone who enjoys tactical decision-making at your own pace.My only (minor) grimace is the lack of map objectives apart from destroying the hives. In the campaign, one map that stood out for me was the one where you had to bring back canisters to your base while trying to fend of the infested assassins. Adding randomised additional map objectives such as these would significantly amp up the intensity, replayability and thoughtfulness required on the player's part, which I'm sure hardcore Infested Planet players such as myself would immensely enjoy.9/10 - a solid piece of work!

It's faster, in that I can easily jump get, play 10m and get some seriously intense action, and then the mission is over. Cash and upgrade system make you want to keep coming back. Tough missions require having to sacrifice locations, attack when you don't feel fully secure, press advantage or know when to retreat.I waffled on this a lot but I'm super glad I bought it!			"

												I highly recommend this game. There is a short, generic story by means of dialogue windows to go along with it that serves its purpose to move from one mission to the next. The reason this game is great though is because of the gameplay. I feel that the player and the enemy are very well matched and the mechanic for capturing points with your squad (or other mission objectives) to build up your squad is rewarding. In addition, I found that the Attack+Move command works intelligently (e.g. snipers/scouts will target towers/buildings among the horde of enemies so there is no need to micromanage when things get crazy). The variety of weapons/technologies and enemy types is more than enough to keep the game interesting and allow for multiple strategies. In the Campaign section there are multiple types of games too (standard, raid, hunt, etc.) that will shift your strategies.I am most impressed with the Endgame content. I felt the acheivements were adequately challenging yet fair. In addition to the Campaign, there is a Skirmish mode and a set of Weekly challenges (with a leaderboard). The Skirmish mode is basically a map generator with all sorts of customization. The only thing I would ask for from the Skirmish mode is the ability to increase the rate of growth of the enemy past the current capping point. Otherwise, for the asking price, this is a great game.

												Infested Planet is brilliantly asymmetrical. On one side, the marines. Rarely more than a dozen, armed with rifles, shotguns, or other weapons, marines run fast and hit hard. On the other side, the swarm. Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of aliens, slowly creeping towards the player’s bunkers. Mutations in the aliens constantly alter and improve the abilities of the swarm, and force the player to re-evaluate strategies. The player needs to simultaneously balance holding off the enemy swarm and taking the fight back to the aliens. The result is a complicated and tense game of thrusts into weak flanks, retreats from overwhelming force, desperate stands at choke points, and constant shifting of troop load out and strategy to match enemy capabilities. Highly recommended.			"

The graphics are simple but very clear and effective , the gameplay is what truly shines . Its a mix of tower defence and rts , you are defending lanes and your bases while taking over alien nests . Random things can happen mid mission such as aliens evolving or more nests popping up . Keeps you on your toes and is challanging but not impossible . I dont rate too many games , im a fussy gamer and it takes a lot for a game to win me over ... this game has won me over and so far im really enjoying it . After i finish the campaign i look forward to trying the weekly missions the devs supply .			"

												I didn't really expect much from this game, bought it in a sale, it seemed kinda interesting, then I forgot about it.Found it in my library recently, decided to give it a shot, got addicted to it! It's the kind of game that I wanted to play for a long time but everyone would always over complicate things or it would be a glitchy mess.No glitches found so far, you tell a unit to build, walk and attack, walk, or carry something. Every unit can do this, groups are surprisingly easy to work with and everything is nice and basic. There's no money, you have points that you can spend on buildings or troups that can be refunded, you can't lose these points, but you can gain points depending on the mission. Story mode was a joy to go through with interesting situations, the escort missions were done right (They draw a path and tell you when they plan to start moving, just clear it out and secure the bases around it, done!) Basic but interesting situations with adapting hives that change constantly to keep them interesting (Counter attack mutation always made things slightly awkward when capturing a new base, slow down poison made my army of flamethrowers struggle to get to the fight etc). It's a simple game, but it doesn't need to be any more then that. Really enjoyed it- looking forward to the developers next game!			"

												Infested Planet is somewhat reminiscent of Starcraft, however there is no resource harvesting and construction of buildings and bases more straighforward. Since the player has to manage large enemy swarms coming from various directions, it is important to figure out where to place marines and equipment such as gun turrets in order to keep one swarm from advancing, while taking out another that is situated at a different location. The game is simple to understand and highly addictive. It does get repetitive when one plays it for long sessions, however it's always fun to get back to it after a day or so.			"

												I have to say that Infested Planet is genuine RTS game. It has everything that is needed in it.Once you start progressing in campaing and random missions you will feel difficulty going higher, monsters will spawn more fierce and more relentlessly than until now.Modifiers are making this game exciting and even more difficult, it would be a shame if monsters had HP regen, shield, and neurotoxins.. but who played it knows that 3 modifiers is the only beginning.. You can always WIN if u act FAST and be prepared to make sacrafices.Upgrades are necessary but which one you need? -granades? is awesome but Life Support module might be even more helpful, but what about teleporting device? it will give you AI controlled unit every single time when your squad member dies.. but wait what about buildings? oh yes you have to share precious resources between - buildings, upgrade modules and soldier upgrades. resources are LIMITED. It's up to you if u can kill the bugs. never give up!But if u still can't win with your genuine mind then buy one time buffs. more soldiers , additional flamethrower or minigun can change whole game. or at least help you survive another 5 minutes..+Fast pace+progress difficulty+graphic+price+replayability (random missions with random difficulty FTW)+weekly challenges "

												About 600 hours under my belt with this game.. which is ridiculous. What I love about this game is you can do a short game and then get back to work! Or play all day. It's strategic and tactical, problem-solving, and you get to lay waste to thousands of critters. The expansion is well worth it! The campaign is neat when you're first starting out, but I don't play it anymore. I really, really love the weekly challenges, getting to compete against other players for top scores.Get the expansion, after you get the game of course. It's an elegant game, well-done, small and powerful. It has immense replayability. Out of all the steam games I've bought, this is the only one I still play all the time after so long. Like I said, it has elegance. Highly recommended!And when you feel like you've mastered it, you can do custom games that seriously stack the odds against yourself. And then spend an hour or two desparately trying to win. Seriously, people, this is the best-valued game I've ever bought on steam. It's totally worth it.			"

												I really enjoy defence games and this one was a very unexpected suprise.  I absolutely love this game.  The gameplay is outstandingly good with some very devious A.I. that can be incredibly challenging.  One of the things I love most about Infested Planet is the ability to recycle without losing resources.  This then free's up your resource points enabling you to re-equip your toops or build structures on the fly.  This system makes this game incredibly tactical and incredibly fun.  If you like a game that makes you, think, adapt and experiement  with tactics and strategy you will really enjoy Infested Planet.  I have played this a lot and can see this game keeping me hooked long term.  It is in early access with much more to come....bonus ^-^.  Cannot wait.  Highly recommeded.

												Infested planet is a nice twist to the RTS genre. This time around you get small squad of tough guys and need to fight thousands of insecoid aliens. The closest thing I can compare it to would be perhaps Terran vs Zerg in Starcraft, but taken to extreme. The game mechanics are very well designed, missions are tough, especially later in the campaign, when aliens play all the tricks in their arsenal and you reallly need to adapt your strategy as the situations changes.  On the other hand you can make your life easier by playing some optional missions to earn cash. You can do it as many times as you want and then spend the cash on bonuses that will help you beat the campaign. An extra flamethrower or even additional rifle marine can be priceless. What is great about the game's design is that it allows you to recycle the resources you spent. This means you can try different things and if you make a mistake or circumstances changes in a way you couldn't possibly expect, you can still correct it. Well, you can at least try :-). This is an indie game, done by a small team, so don't expect fancy graphics. What you'll see is clean & readable. For me that's perfectly fine. The only real problem I have with this game is that it crashes to desktop on my Mac  from time to time. It doesn't make the game unplayable, but it's annoying.If you like RTS-like games you should try Infested Planet.			"

												Infested Planet is a great singleplayer RTS where you control a handful of mercenaries and their toys to defeat thousands millions of aliens. Because of the big contrast in numbers from both sides, you have to outsmart the AI, use chokepoints and carefully plan out your route to conquest. This makes it a challenging game, which makes it very rewarding when clearing a level.A great feature in Infested Planet is that you earn points from capturing enemy Hives, which you can spend on more toys for your guys. The best part is that you can redistribute your points at any time: this means that if a tactic is not working, you can fall back, reclaim everything, redistribute your points and try again.The game has a 30 level campaign (17 story missions and 13 random missions); 5 weekly challenges at different difficulties, where you can compete with other people to get the fastest time; and a random map generator where you can change almost anything: from the number of Hives, the powerups (mutations) the enemy has, how much resources your team has, the difficulty and many more. This means you have endless fun despite being a singleplayer.			"

												Great shooter game.  Very enjoyable addictive game.Reminds me of the Starship Troopers film.Hords of what seem endless enemies, fight your way through the spawning millions and kill the heart of the nest.They will adapt and grow stronger the more nests you kill.  So adapt your powers and employ your guys with better weapons and extra men.  Re-enforce sections with stationary gun mounts to hold them back whilst you face multipul fronts.Very easy to play. Wish game had an eaiser setting as sometimes I just cannot find a way to complete a mission.Hope this programer/crew make more for the game and looking forward to anything new.			"

												Rarely am I so entertained by a game as to make me spend 10 minutes reviewing it for others. However Infested Planet is an exceptional piece of work. Well worth every cent I paid for it and more. I cannot recommend this game more highly to someone looking to burn away several hours or even a few dozen. I've passed 20 hours now, and still enjoy the dynamic challenge.Infested Planet has the base and resource management of an RTS mixed with a tower-defense, the micro skills of a MOBA, and the low-cost (and fast action) of a cheap date. Again I cannot recommend this game more highly.To the creators, I applaud you. Further applause will come when you release more content packs in the form of relatively inexpensive DLC, including but not limited to map-packs, new unit types, new enemy types, and more research options! Many thanks.TL;DRGame is good - buy game - enjoy game			"

If your not staying on top of everything the alien hordes will over run you. weather you get (infested planet) on sale or buy it out right Im sure you'll enjoy infested planet. As you move forwards in the game and upgrade you can go back to old missions with your new upgrades or sit on the same mission and buy up the shop before advancing.10*/10*			"

Through Squad Upgrades or orbital strikes or just a good old ""box"" 1 formation with Turrets? The responsiveness of the gameplay is amazingly fluid, allowing player the flexibility to adapt, regroup and reset the flow of battle however we want it.Do you miss the good old gameplay classics where fun is where you watch your command and control plans come altogether?  Then, this game is just right for you.Not necessary a must try however, a good recommend especially to all who ever wondered, what really, is call gameplay back in the days of Army Men the game.			"

												I wasn't expecting this game to be nearly as good as I found it to be. the campaign is for the most part suberb with a large amount of gameplay variety. The large amount of technologies available to unlock allow for alot of options and the shop allows you to purchase tempory buffs that last until one mission win, which makes getting stuck on a hard level bareable. The last couple of missions both random and story can be very frustrating. The mutation system causes the aliens to counter your tactics and can easy turn the mission un winnable. Earning money and keeping my buffs on surrendering helped negate this, but they were still a bare. The DLC adds some cool powers to use with ammo, but I feel its a little too much for what it does. Overall this is a great RTS that sould leave you entertained for a dozen or soo hours			"

It can be as casual or as satisfyingly hard as you want it to be with the range of difficulties included. A variety of soldier and building options and limited resources to build them make all choices important.A must have for fans of tower defense.Pros: Variety of soldier and building options Range of difficulty choices to play at your level Lots of missions to play through Story, skirmish, and campaign modes add replayability Limited resources keep soldier teams small in a good way Can't recall ever encountering a bug Graphics are simple, but match gameplay perfectly Appropriately priced Great game for short (break) sessionsCons: Not a lot of depth (gets repetitive in long sessions) Very little variation of level designMy scale: 1 = hate, 2-3 = dislike, 4-5 = okay, 6-7 = like, 8-9 = love10 reserved for rare games that I'll remember forever			"

Simple resource gathering (by killing aliens and taking their capture points) and careful thought of resource use and gun/tech placement... during intense  high action RTS style play. Think zergling swarm from hell.  As you go further, there are bug mutations and new maps, which increases the challenge.. and it makes it *immensly* satisfying when you overcome the bugs and start pushing them back. They *swarm* but your firepower litterally mows them down... but then they increase in numbers and toughness... and your mowdown doesn't slow *them* down.. they push you back.. o.O  This is a *great* simple game. I got it on sale, so i don't know if i would get it @ $15.. but if this sounds like your type of game, you will not be disappointed.			"

What to pay : <10€.You play a mercenary commander aiding the army colonisation of a new planet. Unfortuantely, it has a bug problem.Infested Planet adds what most tower defences lack; actual strategy. Surprisingly well balanced, this game isn't going to punish you, but it's not going sit down and take it either. The 10 to 15 min missions and forgiving nature make this a very agreeable ""I only have a little while"" title.  You can even surrender a mission at any point and still walk away with a little of your merc pay. Some of the missions don't even need you to progress to make cash. It's a case of not dying.So what do you spend your merc pay on? Well, for a start, upgrades. The odd thing about them is that while many games do the same, the offerings here really give flexibility. It doesn't truely matter WHAT you unlock, but rather what you build on map. Even if you buy an upgrade you didn't want, no worries. You can't undo it, but you're not cockblocked.You can also purchase one-shot additional mercenaries. You'll never run out of things to spend cash on, nor missions :)My best tip : minefields are often a better choice than a turret if you can use it in a chokepoint.			"

												""The only good bug, is a DEAD bug!""-Displaced resident of Buenos AiresIn a game that asks if you apes want to live forever, all you can do is arm up and take it to the enemy. For such a small game, Infested Planet offers quite a bit of entertainment. It can be play in nice little 30-40 minute increments, or for longer stretches...depending on how many bugs you need to kill.It's well balanced, each map having a variety of different methods to victory. There is certainly no ""right"" build order, and the player is free to fight the way that they perfer. Additionally, the mutation mechanic ensures that you never quite get too comfortable.All in all, it's a good bit of fun.			"

												This is a pretty awesome little realtime strategy game. The capture-and-hold elements along with various upgrades have kept it interesting while the constantly-overwhelming-feeling gameplay has stayed entertaining.			"

												It's a great game, but has some game breaking issues and ballance problems in the later levels. Half of the upgrades arn't cost effective (per mission ones) and the buildings are pointless except the teleporter.It starts well, and the hardness increases to a point where it's more fustrating (due to the ballance issues) than fun to play.

												This is going to be a true and honest review for anyone looking to buy this game.Personal Raiting: Must buy for tower defense lovers.On a scale of 1-10: This game is a 9.5 personally it is a very hard game. You see so many easy tower defense games but this is so easy level 1-5 but later your going to have a pain with this but totally worth time spending and coming up with a good plan.Genre: Tower Defense and Strategy.When to buy: Well a sale is great but 15$ for this game is honestly worth it completely :)Now for a personal review: First I wanted to say that this game is very good but i still have yet to beat everything cause it is quite hard.  There are trading cards and achievments for those certain people and the achievments are easy to get for the most part though. But back to the game itself you look at this and it look slike an FPS but then you actual play the game and your like woah wait what am I playing. So you have a squad of 4 men who are able to be upgraded into differnt classes and you are able to build stations to improve your bases quality. So your goal is to take your squad and invade aliens bases. Over time the aliens gain perks which are very annoying for the most part which makes this part of the game the planning part. For most story missions there are set levels where you have to play on but there are also side quests where every time you do it the level is randomly generated which is also another plus. So you take over bases build turrets and you have this thing called BP which is pretty much how you upgrade things and your squad of 4 may be increased using BP. You may also redo any missions to gain more money for perks. Some perks last forever and some are a one time mission only. Now for the two side quests you may do. There are two types the first type is command and conquer and the second part is time limit destruction. In command and conquer you must pretty much take over evrey base you see, you have infinite time but let me warn you as they will gain perks the longer you play. There are 3 majoy difficulties which are where the achievments come in. Now for time limit destruction you must destroy all of the bases within a time limit. For every base you destroy you gain more time. This also has 3 majoy difficulties just like command and conquer. So overall this game is worth getting for anybody you can grasp the concept easily you might rage later on but you won't regret this buy :)!!!!!!!! "

												I really like this game. It's best described as an ""arcade RTS"", easy to pick up, fun to play. The biggest problem is that the single player campaign is quite short. There seems to be an update coming, let's hope it includes a longer campaign.			"

												I just bought a boatload of games during the steam summer sale and this is the one I keep coming back to. It's very fun and has a nice level of difficulty. You have many options how to tackle a mission but without being bogged down by any micromanagement whatsoever. You also have a ton of flexibility in how you play due to the ability to buy, sell, rebuy or change classes at a whim. The small group of marines you control really gives the feeling that each one matters and it's pretty neat to see what a single unit or two can accomplish. Very highly recommended. More people should know about this game.			"

												reminds me a bit of the old cannon fodder games blended with a tower defence and even some darwinia with the way you have to cleanse an area as you move through it. Your troops are dangerous but expendable but can't take many hits without support), aliens are relentless hordes that inprove and counter attack, fixed weapons are powerful but can not handle certain enemy types or being flanked.A fun title, well worth trying out.

												Small game by indie developer , its nice to see the developer keeps interest and is loyal to thier fans by adding new weekly missions . The graphics are simple but very clear and effective , the gameplay is what truly shines . Its a mix of tower defence and rts , you are defending lanes and your bases while taking over alien nests . Random things can happen mid mission such as aliens evolving or more nests popping up . Keeps you on your toes and is challanging but not impossible . I dont rate too many games , im a fussy gamer and it takes a lot for a game to win me over ... this game has won me over and so far im really enjoying it . After i finish the campaign i look forward to trying the weekly missions the devs supply .			"

												I didn't really expect much from this game, bought it in a sale, it seemed kinda interesting, then I forgot about it.Found it in my library recently, decided to give it a shot, got addicted to it! It's the kind of game that I wanted to play for a long time but everyone would always over complicate things or it would be a glitchy mess.No glitches found so far, you tell a unit to build, walk and attack, walk, or carry something. Every unit can do this, groups are surprisingly easy to work with and everything is nice and basic. There's no money, you have points that you can spend on buildings or troups that can be refunded, you can't lose these points, but you can gain points depending on the mission. Story mode was a joy to go through with interesting situations, the escort missions were done right (They draw a path and tell you when they plan to start moving, just clear it out and secure the bases around it, done!) Basic but interesting situations with adapting hives that change constantly to keep them interesting (Counter attack mutation always made things slightly awkward when capturing a new base, slow down poison made my army of flamethrowers struggle to get to the fight etc). It's a simple game, but it doesn't need to be any more then that. Really enjoyed it- looking forward to the developers next game!			"

												WIthin my relatively short time playing I have found myself seriously enjoying this title. Though the visuals aren't exactly top-notch, the gameplay itself is quite visceral. The way you destroy huge groups of endless alien creatures is well done. Using the equipment you develop feels like it is actually useful and trying to use what resources you have effectively is challenging but far from impossible. The difficulty both from scenario to scenario as well as within each piece is reasonably well-done. If I was to criticise this game for anything it would be that there isn't the ability to hotkey squads like in a standard RTS so you have to be a bit more careful about splitting your troops up, but most of the time you bundle up and attack move anyway. This leads to a bit of potential oversimplicity for some, although I like the straightforward nature of the game.Overall an enjoyable experience and well worth it having picked it up while it was on sale.

												Infested Planet is somewhat reminiscent of Starcraft, however there is no resource harvesting and construction of buildings and bases more straighforward. Since the player has to manage large enemy swarms coming from various directions, it is important to figure out where to place marines and equipment such as gun turrets in order to keep one swarm from advancing, while taking out another that is situated at a different location. The game is simple to understand and highly addictive. It does get repetitive when one plays it for long sessions, however it's always fun to get back to it after a day or so.			"

												I really enjoy defence games and this one was a very unexpected suprise.  I absolutely love this game.  The gameplay is outstandingly good with some very devious A.I. that can be incredibly challenging.  One of the things I love most about Infested Planet is the ability to recycle without losing resources.  This then free's up your resource points enabling you to re-equip your toops or build structures on the fly.  This system makes this game incredibly tactical and incredibly fun.  If you like a game that makes you, think, adapt and experiement  with tactics and strategy you will really enjoy Infested Planet.  I have played this a lot and can see this game keeping me hooked long term.  It is in early access with much more to come....bonus ^-^.  Cannot wait.  Highly recommeded.  One of the best games I have bought on Steam.			"

												A nice RTS that you control a squad of 5 to 10 soldiers to kill swarm of aliens and capture their hives. You can upgrade each soldiers with more powerful weapons and build buildings and towers to defend the points you captured. I like that you can refund all the BP spended at any time of the battle to refit your soldiers for different situation.Although late in the game the strategy seems a bit repetitive, the fast paced and intensive gameplay keeps you from getting bored. This is my go-to game when I have 30 minutes of time.			"

The relentless top down view is so much more useful than the usual isometric 3D mapped design used frequently elsewhere.The pause/command/run mechanic was perfectly thought out, with units responding intelligently to commands.I could have used a little bit more tutorial.

What to pay : <10€.You play a mercenary commander aiding the army colonisation of a new planet. Unfortuantely, it has a bug problem.Infested Planet adds what most tower defences lack; actual strategy. Surprisingly well balanced, this game isn't going to punish you, but it's not going sit down and take it either. The 10 to 15 min missions and forgiving nature make this a very agreeable ""I only have a little while"" title.  You can even surrender a mission at any point and still walk away with a little of your merc pay. Some of the missions don't even need you to progress to make cash. It's a case of not dying.So what do you spend your merc pay on? Well, for a start, upgrades. The odd thing about them is that while many games do the same, the offerings here really give flexibility. It doesn't truely matter WHAT you unlock, but rather what you build on map. Even if you buy an upgrade you didn't want, no worries. You can't undo it, but you're not cockblocked.You can also purchase one-shot additional mercenaries. You'll never run out of things to spend cash on, nor missions :)My best tip : minefields are often a better choice than a turret if you can use it in a chokepoint.			"

												The moment I saw the trailer for this, I knew I'd like it. Here's why I do:1. The size of the experience. It's a properly bite-sized game: you put in ten to twenty minutes (granted, at the early-middle part of the game where I am) and get out solid strategy.2. Upgrades and buybacks. The game doesn't penalize you for trying something new, discovering it doesn't work, and selling the weapons and structures you made in pursuit of a certain tactic.3. The overall feel. Surmounting insurmountable odds always feels great, and wading slowly forward into a morass of smoking insectoid ichor is a good way to induce that feeling.			"

												How would I describe Infested Planet? Well it is basically the Starship Troopers films and animation in a nutshell. Your objective varies for each level; either being destroy all alien hives, survive, or escort. You, the player/commander, are given points (BP, the purple currency) at the start of each level and gain more for destroying hives, recyling buildings and units, and capturing boxs. The tools vary from support buildings or automated turrets. Your opponents, the alien scum, is well pretty dang mindless. They attack you on a path and can be stopped with ease. The basic ones anyway. They do adapt just so you know, I'll let you find out.Pros: Commiting genocide on alien scumOrdering your men to their immediate doom(But no in all seriousness)Good unit pathfinding <--- A+ (Is a must game developers, do not ignore this!)Unit variiety <--- units can be upgraded with different weapons and behave differently depending on weaponStrong replayabilityCompetent enemy AI <---- may not appear it but they are.

												If you enjoyed the movies ""Aliens 2"" and ""Starship Troopers"", you will definitely enjoy a few minutes of diversionary bug-splattering fun in this game.Its low-tech look and simplified controls allow you to focus on what matters, killing bugs/aliens so you can take out their hives!

												In a word: fun.if you like RTS games, then this is a fun, casual horde-mode RTS. There's not a great deal of base building, just strategic turret placement, and you don't really build an army so much as micro-manage a small squad.very satisfying watching all those little bugs die, but there's actually so many of them that if you're not careful you will be overwhelmed. they have more powerful units and defenses which you'll need to take into consideration, so it's by no means too easy, after the first few levels the difficulty ramps up reasonably fast, and as you go through the story you'll unlock more side-missions which are repeatable and randomly generated.9/10, not absolute perfection, but then what is?

												Okay, this game is pretty fantastic.Infested Planet is similar to World in Conflict (or an older game Ground Control) in sense that you take control of a small squad and have a limited way of expanding or upgrading it, resulting in a game where winning mostly comes down to how well you can manage your units.And, oh boy, how much fun that is.Each mission starts with a certain amount of points, that you can spend on upgrading your marines to different classes, building supporting structures, or calling in for additional units. Because there is no way to lose those points, you are free to mess around and experiment with them as much as you like. At any point in the mission you can reclaim your invested resources and instantly spend them on something else. Which, as the game progress, will actually become an essential tactic in your path to victory.At first you will be having fun by simply killing the aliens the hundreds, but as you become better at the game so does the aliens start evolving. Sooner or later they will start countering your favorite tactics by dynamically developing new forms of attack, which is exactly why it becomes so important to be comfortable with reusing your resources and reforming your squad to use a different set of units.Although the game starts rather easy, it ramps up in challenge quite nicely, and by the end reaching a point where you will be forced to use every possible weapon in your arsenal. Infested Planet is easy to get into, offers quick action, fast missions, and most importantly tones of fun.8/10			"

												An excelent game for someone who enjoys strategy games. The last 9 hours have been a blast. The controls were very intuitive and the interface easy to interact with. The second to last mission boggled me a bit but only because the boss has a bizzare amount of health and no indicator bar. The resource system is awesome with the abilty to upgrade your squad going into the missions by using the money earned in the last one being a fantastic idea. The need to balance your force between infantry and defenses is a great mechanic, being able to sell back the extra infantry dynamically when a more static defence is needed or hire more on the spot when you need to run to a defense makes the game playable in many different ways. If you are going to play then remember that  you can instantly sell any unit for a full refund of it's price. Also if you suddenly have a lot of money, it is probably because your defenses just got steamrolled. This game is definitely recommended			"

												I bought this game during the recent sale. Overall I am happy with my purchase. That being said lets begin with the review.This is a very strategic game where even slight mistakes equals instant failure. You play as marine mercenaries fighting a war against a alien bug spiecies. In the campaign you acquire money from playing missions even failing them. You can then use this money to unlock upgrades to marines, structures, and abilities which you can then use in game.Overtime in the games, with moderately challenging difficulty, the aliens tend to mutate to the point they just steam roll right over your heavily deffended base. This being said if played correctly you can as the marines do the same to the aliens.I bought the DLC as part of the sale so some of the following may regard to it. The in game set up is very well done with well planned hotkeys it is very easy to manage upgrades are abilities quickly. Although you can beat the campaign and most of the random missions in under 8 to 10 hours the actual campaign missions are very replayable. If that is not enough for you there is also the ability to play skirmishes where you choose the map and difficulty. In addition you can also change the skirmish settings giving you pratically infinite resources for a easy fun game where you can screw around,All this being said it is still a strategy game. So if you don't like losing over and over to what seems to be an unwinable struggle against the alien bug race then this may not be the game for you. However if you like a challenge and strategy games I highly recomend this game. Thanks for your time!			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Real time strategy ""Tower Defence"" game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play in fullscreen or windowed mode.There are many different resolution sizes.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.Able to change the controls on your keyboard.You are able to disable the screen shake.Has skirmish mode, Story mode and DLC Campaign.About the game.You will play with a set of marines to take over the enemy hives and elimating them one by one. There are literally SWARMS of enemies which will constantly attack you and you have to hold them off or engage them to stop the alien swarm coming out of the hives. You are able to upgrade your marines with better weapons, making defensive or offensive buildings or support upgrades. Hives will get stronger and they will gain upgrades and buffs whenever they are getting closer and closer to defeat. Aliens may change their attack pattern way and attack you from a different angle. Enemies could get like shields, Regeneration, stronger Aliens and alot more. This is randomized. Marines that dies while they are equipped with a different weapons, will not make them drop their weapon. The respawn timer depends on the equipped weapon marine.Interesting story and has side missions.Random maps and Enemy Buffs.Defensive/offensive/support buildings. Upgradeable marines with different weapons during ingame.Could be repetitive but also addictive.Upgradable/unlockable perks and buffs, Permanently and during ingame.Interesting gameplay,Decent music.Easy controls.Other things.Aliens will choose+Find an alternate path to attack and surprise you. Which will mean you have to keep your eyes and stay focused on all times. You will never know if you get attacked from the back or a totally unexpected way. I like this idea and makes the alien more ""random"" and forces you to stay tuned. If you aren't doing this then the enemy could make a comeback and you will lose the game.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												First impressions:  I recommend this game to die hard RTS buffs looking for something different.  I wouldn't call it a tower defense game though.  Although you do place some turrets at times, the game is more mobile and you keep moving from area to area clearing out bug infested buildings which you take over slowly turning them into bases to win the game.  At some point in the game after purchasing the buff, you can heal at each base.  You do not go inside buildings, just around them.  They all look the same and server one purpose.  To become another healing point for you once cleared.  You must clear every building to beat the map.This is like other reviewers have pointed out.  It is a very basic, repetitious swarm control game.  You are constantly controlling areas and trying to destroy the spawn points around the small maps as fast as you can.  As I said, the game is pretty basic and get repetitious fast.  One reason for this is that you will play the same maps over and over again to get money to purchase perks.  Some perks are permanent and some are one time use.  It is somewhat a grind-fest!The maps are different.  One reviewer stated it was the same map the whole game and that is not true.   They just look the same as the textures are not all that different.  At one point I found it harder to pass the same level than before and it was pure strategy.  I had lost my 3 shotgunners….  If you lose the soldiers that got the good weapon drops, they respawn with basic weapons again and makes it hard to pass beat the maps sometimes.  Don't lose them!  Heal them!This is just my first impressions and I might change or update this review, but as I said, the game is fairly basic and gets repetitious, but does have that Starship Troopers feel of being overwhelmed by aliens!  The game seems solid, polished and made with love of the genre.  So far I recommend it to RTS die hards only!			"

												Infested Planet is a real-time strategy game with a tug-of-war play style & take-and-hold objectives.  Science fiction themed, the game takes place on a new planet that is being colonized by space fairing humans who encounter another sentient form of life on the planet.The Good: This was the best example of an indie RTS I've ever seen!  It is almost impossible to compete the complexity (and the limitless budget) of games like StarCraft or Company of Heroes but this little indie title did an excellent job of giving us a simplified and streamlined RTS that didn’t ""simplify"" the fun out of playing the game.  There a light research tree, single mission unlocks for the extra tough missions, a weekly challenge for those who want more and just enough story and music to be fun but not get in the way.  The units seemed balanced and everything you unlock (almost) has a purpose and is useful in the right situation.  The game is also delightfully challenging; it’s by no means a push over but you’ll lose a few mission before ya get it right!The Bad:  At least for me, the chopper air-strike and the ammo facility combo seemed really (Really!) good, that may need a small nerf but really you have to use it at an opportune time or the bugs just swarm back over the area.  Also, and this is always a sideways compliment, the game was a bit too short.  I beat it and all of the (non-weekly) side skirmishes in ~14 hours but hey, there's always endless/challenge mode if ya want more.The Funny:  Nothing really ... all action and fun, no bugs, nothing crashed.  I was too busy kicking♥♥♥♥♥to laugh!Summary: 9 out of 10, this is everything an indie game should be.  It didn't try to say, ""We're better than AAA titles,"" (nor did it price itself as such).  It just brought a fun, action packed arena in a familiar but still unique package.  At the time of this writing the game is ~4 bucks and since most movies cost ya $18ish for 1.5 - 2 hours of entertainment I'd take a game like this over any movie night.  This game is great and I'll definitely buy from this group if they put out more stuff.  The game is Infested Planet: Get it, Play it, Love it!			"

Nothing like hordes of bugs charging your position while you do everything you can to keep alive.  The game does ramp up quickly but nothing you can't handle.  Endgame requires buying items from the store inbetween missions.  I could see not having anything but the powerups and troop classes are critical.  Once you have played through, the weekly chalanges will keep the game fresh for awhile.  Horde mode for the GLORY!!!			"

												I didn't really expect much from this game, bought it in a sale, it seemed kinda interesting, then I forgot about it.Found it in my library recently, decided to give it a shot, got addicted to it! It's the kind of game that I wanted to play for a long time but everyone would always over complicate things or it would be a glitchy mess.No glitches found so far, you tell a unit to build, walk and attack, walk, or carry something. Every unit can do this, groups are surprisingly easy to work with and everything is nice and basic. There's no money, you have points that you can spend on buildings or troups that can be refunded, you can't lose these points, but you can gain points depending on the mission. Story mode was a joy to go through with interesting situations, the escort missions were done right (They draw a path and tell you when they plan to start moving, just clear it out and secure the bases around it, done!) Basic but interesting situations with adapting hives that change constantly to keep them interesting (Counter attack mutation always made things slightly awkward when capturing a new base, slow down poison made my army of flamethrowers struggle to get to the fight etc). It's a simple game, but it doesn't need to be any more then that. Really enjoyed it- looking forward to the developers next game!			"

												Infested Planet is somewhat reminiscent of Starcraft, however there is no resource harvesting and construction of buildings and bases more straighforward. Since the player has to manage large enemy swarms coming from various directions, it is important to figure out where to place marines and equipment such as gun turrets in order to keep one swarm from advancing, while taking out another that is situated at a different location. The game is simple to understand and highly addictive. It does get repetitive when one plays it for long sessions, however it's always fun to get back to it after a day or so.			"

												This is a realtime strategy game with a capture and hold elements (a bit tower deffense). There are many upgrades for your soldiers with various buildings and deffense buildings. The Constantly overwhelming feeling gameplay has stayed entertaining till the end. It has a main story witch is not too hard not too long ~15h (sadly). As you play on harder lvl-s you have too multitask and micromanage soldiers and abilities to maximize your effort. This game has many game modes raid / survive / capture all / hunt aliens etc you can replay any map as you progress, even replay it for money if you stuck. There are boosters if you stuck at a different point in the storry or other game modes.I bought this while it was on sale, I say it was worth it, fun and entertraning game!			"

												Not the most complex of RTS games, Infested Planet does have just enough challenge to keep you interested. The bugs never stop coming, so you can't ever stop paying attention. It's BP system in place of an economy further livens things up - you can't sit back and build up your power, you're given all that you're going to get till you take some strategic points. You must suffice. It's really very satisfying. Don't be scared off by the tower-defense aspect, as it's not really a tower defence, it's squad management with good solid defence backing it up. You take a point, place a tower to protect one flank and protect the other by sending your mercenaries screaming back into the breach.			"

												Aliens? Check.Lots and lots of aliens? Check.A couple of marines with badass weapons?

Oh they will. Tactical maneuvers work surprisingly well for a simple game. If you want to micro-manage your troops all day, you're more than welcome to.. Or you can just go guns-blazing and send all your troops in with miniguns and grenades going off everywhere.. your call!Overall: Short but sweet. Would recommend!			"

												This is a great little game, it has a nice simple story and insane action.As you progress in the game the difficulty ramps up ten fold, you have to use everthing at your disposal to survive.The game can get repetative after a while but if you just stop playing it for a few days or a week say and come back to it its easy to settle right back into it. But on the whole it is a tight game, everthing contributes to the gameplay well.10/10			"

												Glorious, amazing game, can be considered a starter-level RTS, but its just downright a fun gameThe marines feel like a solid force, each marine is unique and has its own place, the scout seemed a bit useless to me thouThe aliens (or like I call them ""the Swarm"") are menacing, you realy feel like you'll be overwealmed at any point|Solid game, cool RTSI rate it 10/10			"

												After spending a couple of hours in the game since beta time, i came into account that the developers are madmans, i haven't finished the campaign and play the challenges every week, they've becoming harder and harder, and then comeing back for more. This has to be one of the best indie games of all time. I don't care about ratings or professional reviews, i only care about quality and this has it in spades. Infested planet is one of my absolute favorite games of all time and will be comeing back for more even if they came out with a sequel.			"

												Hard. Probably too hard.I cant finish the single player campaign and I don't want try to anymore, it's just tedious watching the AI increase the respawn rates to counter your progress when it feels like you should be doing better, not worse.There is enjoyment and value for money here, but unless you are committed you probably wont finish it. It soon becomes frustrating rather than enjoyable, which is a real shame.			"

												This game is unique and familiar at the same time. It feels like a warcraft 3 map with only heroes. You have a team of 3-9 soldiers that will go against thousands of  enemies, literally. The enemies are simple melee at first but develop much deadlier abilities later in the game or even later on the same map. To counter this your team can change skills on the fly to adapt to any situation. Because of this the game now oddly feels like a first person shooter where you can change from invisibile assassin to close quarters shotgunner to sniper rifle and then to flamethrower in just 3 seconds leaving behind assassinated enemy heroes, dozens of dead spitting aliens a destroyed tower and a burning building including the enemies in it. There is no limit to the changes you can make, marines can change an unlimited number of times, buildings can be recycled getting the full resources back, research and upgrades can be sold back as well. The only limitation is that except plain marines everything else uses resources and thus the number of upgrades that you can have at the same time is limited. Thus it is very important to determine which upgrades you need at a certain point in time and establish a strategy before you jump into combat. The game also features a pause button which I rarely use as i prefer real time strategy over turn based mechanics.You gain resources for captuing enemy points and dragging resource crates back to the bases you own. You do not lose resources when losing a point so while the progress may be slow and incremental, you definetly can try new approaches if you get pushed back after a point capture.There is definetly replay values with random generated maps and a ladder system that shows how well you did on a map as compared to other players. There is also a weekly challenge and a nice story mode with additional mechanics.I definetly recommend the game.			"

												I dismissed this as another entry in the tower defense genre, especially when combined with its middling metacritic score.  After watching a quick Youtube video it was made abundantly clear just how wrong I was!  You do have to fend off swarms of baddies, but more often than not you are juggling your resources and your 'towers' (turrets) are left behind to haplessly try to hold the tide back at key choke points...think the corridor sentries in Aliens.  Don't make the mistake of just glossing this one over before writing it off, it's one heck of a lot of frenetic fun and about as far removed from a traditional tower defense game as you can get.  The Steam trailer actually does this game a huge disservice, both by focusing on secondary aspects of combat and not giving anywhere near an accurate sense of the scope of how battles over the control points play out.

												This game is great, especially if you get it on sale. It's a great mix of rts and tower defense. It does ramp up in difficulty pretty quickly, but the main campaign never gets too difficult. It's mostly the side missions that are a lot harder, but never too difficult as to not see how to win eventually or after restarting. The campaign is about 10-14 hours depending on how many side missions you do. Skirmish mode adds endless more hours of enjoyment. Runs great too.			"

												Not the most complex of RTS games, Infested Planet does have just enough challenge to keep you interested. The bugs never stop coming, so you can't ever stop paying attention. It's BP system in place of an economy further livens things up - you can't sit back and build up your power, you're given all that you're going to get till you take some strategic points. You must suffice. It's really very satisfying. Don't be scared off by the tower-defense aspect, as it's not really a tower defence, it's squad management with good solid defence backing it up. You take a point, place a tower to protect one flank and protect the other by sending your mercenaries screaming back into the breach.			"

												My score: 9/10An enjoyable RTS. It's kind of like playing Starcraft against the zerg. I appreciate that there are different strategies that you can play, and there is no one set way of playing the game ""right."" The AI mutates, which means you have to change your strategy on the fly, and you are able to do so because you can change character class, and buildings on the spot. The game is fast-paced, and there's no resource collecting.Some problems with the game though is that it can be rubber-bandy. You take over one spot and another one gets taken over. You retake it, and the enemy regroups somewhere else... Another problem is that the 'tidying up' phase can be a bit drawn out. Not so bad that you're looking for one peasant hiding somewhere in the fog of war, but there's a point when you can say: ""I won already, c'mon...""Pros:Various strategies work equally well.Fast-paced.Good variety of buildings and character classes.Feels good gunning down waves of aliens.No grinding or other time-consuming activities.Cons:The game is a bit short. But it has decent replay value.Graphics could be better.Controls are not as precise, or snappy as I would've liked.Excellent game, worthy of it's price tag, and an even better deal if on sale.			"

But in this one you can also build small structures and interact with support items on the battlefield.Since it's a 2D title (top view), I also highly recommends for players using low-end computers and notebooks.

												This was an excellent RTS game that due to the small team you're controlling feels more like a top-down action game almost. I'll admit that there are a few upgrades I didn't use often, and one or two that I didn't use at all, but for the most part the upgrades were all very unique. I recommend this game to anyone, and if it is under $10, it is a steal.			"

												Amazing game. I thought i'd get tired quickly of it looking at the screenshots, but the mutators keep it fresh and interesting.  I like how you are basically constantly respecing your soldiers and turrets to adapt to the enemy mutators. Besides, it's not too pricey. There's worse games out there for double the price.			"

												i really recommend this game if your in to RTS games were you build up your base and then get your troops to attack the enemy base but when you play a lot it start to get old but overall it is very good game it has a lot of potential I would love it if there was a whole new campaign dedicated to playing as the aliens and also adding a multiplayer when one person can be the aliens in the other person can be the humans I would also like it if they would add an upgrade or something to make it where you can build tanks and artillery they should also add in a tank like creature for the aliens to deal with the tanks I can't wait to see how this game will turn out there are barely any games on Steam that are like this that's why I love this game "

												I found infested planet to be a challanging and rewarding little game that kept me entertained for a few hours. The missions are not too long or short, and while there isn't a huge depth of strategy, you still need to be able to balance your forces, plan your attacks and be very prepared to react to enemy attacks. Some missions seem particularly challanging until you find the key approach. Very enjoyable, 7/10			"

												Not the most complex of RTS games, Infested Planet does have just enough challenge to keep you interested. The bugs never stop coming, so you can't ever stop paying attention. It's BP system in place of an economy further livens things up - you can't sit back and build up your power, you're given all that you're going to get till you take some strategic points. You must suffice. It's really very satisfying. Don't be scared off by the tower-defense aspect, as it's not really a tower defence, it's squad management with good solid defence backing it up. You take a point, place a tower to protect one flank and protect the other by sending your mercenaries screaming back into the breach.			"

												Great game!  Its main strength is in your ability to choose and play to your desired style.You can choose what kind of squad you have, what missions to take, how you get money, how to attack (more defense or offense), etc.  It is challenging but still allows for a way out.  It allows you to fail and go back in with greater resources and a new strategy.  I like that it is challenging but doesn't make you play the same mission over and over the same way without any real change.Well done!			"

												Infested Planet is strategy game from independent developer Rocket Bear Games. Take charge of 5 veteran soldiers and fight an alien army of 100,000. It's all about striking hard and killing lots of squishy alien bugs. To do this, you get an arsenal of awesome weapons; from walking tanks with miniguns to field artillery, you're set to kick the aliens back down their slimy hole. Infested Planet is a deep strategy game, with plenty of replay value. The game comes with a random map generator, allowing you to play in a new place whenever you want. The aliens themselves mutate unpredictably, and you have to stay on your toes to defeat them. Flex your strategic mind and outsmart the alien menace.			"

												One of the most fun games that I own.I play Infested Planet a couple times every week.  I have played through the story mode several times and will probably do so again.  The weekly challenges give me all the reason I need to keep on coming back for more.  And now there is a campaing mode (sorta like Risk) which is just excellent!The tactical combat is incredibly satisfying.  The way you have to adapt to the ever evolving enemies makes for some of the best squad based combat I have ever played.  There are so many interesting combinations of units, reasearch and tech you can build... I am still discovering new ways to win.Infested Planet has been updated and improved so many times I have lost count.  It is years old and still the developer is still showing love for this unique gem of a game.I cannot recommend Infested Planet strongly enough.			"

												You should play this game if you're looking to play Starship Troopers: The Movie: The Video Game.Note - as the game progresses, and more capabilities are unlocked, it turns in to Starship Troopers: The Book: The Video Game.Seriously, just torrents of blood.Recent update added Ironman mode, making every loss a permanent reduction in your assets, demanding constant vigilance against risk and loss. It's awesome.Additionally, the new DLC for the Planetary Campaign promises engagaging strategic/tactical fun whenever you have some time to kill.I continue to recommend this game after 67 total hours of play. It's not just an indie gem, it's a gem, period.			"

												Do you like tactics? Buy this game.Do you like bug stomping? Buy this game.Do you like a constant escalation of power? Buy this game.Infested Planet is, at first glance, an average looking game, when in reality its an absolute blast to play. The main crux of enjoyment is from the enemies mutations, which in non-scripted settings, mean the enemy aliens are constantly varied and no two encounters feel the same. You'll always be fielding new tactics and combinations of upgrades to beat your opponents, especially on the harder difficulties which can be extremely unfair at times. Regardless, its an amazing womp if you only play the story missions, but I highly suggest trying out other gameplay modes as they spice the game up even further. Infested Planet is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of top-down tactic games.			"

												About 600 hours under my belt with this game.. which is ridiculous. What I love about this game is you can do a short game and then get back to work! Or play all day. It's strategic and tactical, problem-solving, and you get to lay waste to thousands of critters. The expansion is well worth it! The campaign is neat when you're first starting out, but I don't play it anymore. I really, really love the weekly challenges, getting to compete against other players for top scores.Get the expansion, after you get the game of course. It's an elegant game, well-done, small and powerful. It has immense replayability. Out of all the steam games I've bought, this is the only one I still play all the time after so long. Like I said, it has elegance. Highly recommended!And when you feel like you've mastered it, you can do custom games that seriously stack the odds against yourself. And then spend an hour or two desparately trying to win. Seriously, people, this is the best-valued game I've ever bought on steam. It's totally worth it.			"

												This game is really simple to play at first. But with progression, you unlock more weapons, buildings and tactics. This quickly makes the game more challenging, strategic and most importantly, fun.The graphics are simple but allows the display of large numbers of aliens on the screen at once without frame drops. The sound design is effective and the guns sound impactful. I didn't really notice the music; didn't leave any lasting impact.Storywise, nothing much to speak of. It provides the bare minimum for the player to go around killing aliens and their hives.Overall, I highly recommend this game. Great fun for a low cost.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Real time strategy ""Tower Defence"" game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play in fullscreen or windowed mode.There are many different resolution sizes.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.Able to change the controls on your keyboard.You are able to disable the screen shake.Has skirmish mode, Story mode and DLC Campaign.About the game.You will play with a set of marines to take over the enemy hives and elimating them one by one. There are literally SWARMS of enemies which will constantly attack you and you have to hold them off or engage them to stop the alien swarm coming out of the hives. You are able to upgrade your marines with better weapons, making defensive or offensive buildings or support upgrades. Hives will get stronger and they will gain upgrades and buffs whenever they are getting closer and closer to defeat. Aliens may change their attack pattern way and attack you from a different angle. Enemies could get like shields, Regeneration, stronger Aliens and alot more. This is randomized. Marines that dies while they are equipped with a different weapons, will not make them drop their weapon. The respawn timer depends on the equipped weapon marine.Interesting story and has side missions.Random maps and Enemy Buffs.Defensive/offensive/support buildings. Upgradeable marines with different weapons during ingame.Could be repetitive but also addictive.Upgradable/unlockable perks and buffs, Permanently and during ingame.Interesting gameplay,Decent music.Easy controls.Other things.Aliens will choose+Find an alternate path to attack and surprise you. Which will mean you have to keep your eyes and stay focused on all times. You will never know if you get attacked from the back or a totally unexpected way. I like this idea and makes the alien more ""random"" and forces you to stay tuned. If you aren't doing this then the enemy could make a comeback and you will lose the game.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												Interesting little top down strategy game. Story is short and weak. Requires more tooltips as I found myself hovering over things wondering what they were. While some objects / characters have tooltips, not all do. Once you've figured out a strategy it is very easy to steam roll through most maps.The gameplay is where the game shines alittle. You control marines or towers to block and slowly take out enemy bugs. Unlocking marine upgrades or tower/base upgrades to allow you to eradiate bugs. Simple controls.Makes me think of a prison architect / alien swarm hybrid5/10. Buy when on sale.			"

												A very enjoyable RTS with Starship Troopers elements (featuring tons of bug-like enemies to kill). It's a RTS game that you jump in imediately into action, with total emphasis on combat. The gameplay reminds me a bit the classic Cannon Fodder game. But in this one you can also build small structures and interact with support items on the battlefield.Since it's a 2D title (top view), I also highly recommends for players using low-end computers and notebooks.

												Love this game very little to say about it other than it is worth the price, maybe a little short but the creator has made measures to make it last indefinitely like the DLC and custom map creation in the base game! It is a odd and awesome mix of RTS and tower defense that I hope I see a sequal to maybe? Either way definitely a game I will be recommending and remembering!			"

Quite a basic concept that I didn't think I would like a lot, but then I bought it and played for 2 hours straight off the bat. Easily understood mechanics, countless hours of content thanks to a variety of units and upgrades to unlock over time aswell as extra higher difficulties for you pro players like me, enjoy this tower defence/RTS masterpiece!

												This game is great, especially if you get it on sale. It's a great mix of rts and tower defense. It does ramp up in difficulty pretty quickly, but the main campaign never gets too difficult. It's mostly the side missions that are a lot harder, but never too difficult as to not see how to win eventually or after restarting. The campaign is about 10-14 hours depending on how many side missions you do. Skirmish mode adds endless more hours of enjoyment. Runs great too.			"

												I dismissed this as another entry in the tower defense genre, especially when combined with its middling metacritic score.  After watching a quick Youtube video it was made abundantly clear just how wrong I was!  You do have to fend off swarms of baddies, but more often than not you are juggling your resources and your 'towers' (turrets) are left behind to haplessly try to hold the tide back at key choke points...think the corridor sentries in Aliens.  Don't make the mistake of just glossing this one over before writing it off, it's one heck of a lot of frenetic fun and about as far removed from a traditional tower defense game as you can get.  The Steam trailer actually does this game a huge disservice, both by focusing on secondary aspects of combat and not giving anywhere near an accurate sense of the scope of how battles over the control points play out.

												Reminiscent of a tower defense game, this is an almost mellow RTS that rewards you for playing it. The funds accumulation system means that practicing for a hard level rewards directly through the collection of extra resources and indirectly through the experience you gain. The game is easy enough to approach, and deep enough to drown in. I thoroughly enjoyed it.			"

Some of the side ones have a random factor as well so you can replay then a bit.There are also skirmish and Weekly challenges modes that you can play too, so this is a solid purchase!			"

												Infested Planet is awesome! It plays like they combined the best parts of squad-based RTS and tower defense. Resource management and research are present but streamlined, so you can do more of what's really important: Getting your marines into the fight. The point costs for everything are extremely well balanced, I never found myself thinking that something was too expensive or too cheap. There's enough game modes to keep it interesting for a long time. Game play modes include skirmishes, where you to take and hold points; raids, where you have to take as many points as you can before the time runs out; survival mode, where they just keep coming and coming until you are finally overwhelmed; and a campaign that combines aspects of all of these modes. There's also a challenge map that changes weekly. I haven't finished the campaign or tried the planetary campaign yet, but so far my favorite game mode is survival. The DLC is also extremely fun. Some of the game modes mentioned above are added by it, and it also adds a few neat things for your marines to use. You don't need the DLC to enjoy the game, however. It stands by itself very well. The only downside I can think of for this game is that the music gets a bit repetitive at times, but that could be just because I am playing it so much. :DEverything considered, this game is very polished, a jewel. I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												It's decent fun. Maybe 7 or 8 out of 10. Simplistic mechanics and even if it looks like something out of a flashgame 8 years ago it plays out real nice. Solid time eater if you like this genre. Campaing isn't huge and content is limited. Without the DLC the game feels like it's missing something. In the end, you relize it's missing the DLC that contains the rest of the game, and a fairly big chunk of it. My only problem here is the price tag. 14,99€ is too much for the main game alone. Rocket Bear Games didn't publish the full game that it should be on purpose to sell the DLC later for that sweet sweet money. Planetary Campaing should have been part of the main game. Main game as it is now should be priced 9,99€. As for the DLC, you should get that as well. But it's too expensive. With the DLC the price tag should say 14,99€. Not 19,85€ as it is now. My advise is get it from sale when there's actual big discounts. It's not worth the current full price. Otherwise good game.			"

You really have to know your troops and even more important, know your enemy!10/10			"
