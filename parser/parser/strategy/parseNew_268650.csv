								As a player who has over 2,400 hours into this game, i would have to say that I like it. For people who like building things this game provides an outlet to not only be creative, but to also try to put together new and interesting mechanical functions and systems.So, what is the game?Fundamentally, it is a complex vehicle designer with a focus on water based ships, and flying things which you then use to destroy other designs either in the vehicle designer, or in the massive campaign.As a new player you will first be heading to the Vehicle designer to figure out how to build something. Here you can use blocks to build the shapes of the vehicle you want. Anything from Small boats to battleships, jets to spaceships, hydrofoils, helicopters, submarines, even rudimentary ground units (Wheels and ground stuff are rumored to be improved in the future)You can mix and match as you please too, want a ship powered by large jets? Fine, go for it, its all up to your creativity.The weapon systems are also highly customizable, you dont just choose a gun from a list and smack it down on the ship, no in FTD you build the weapons block by block. Want cannon? Well do you want fast firing machine guns? That will take many auto-loaders and ammo boxes and little or no gauge increases. Want it to shoot Armor piercing rounds or Explosive? Gotta added those blocks to the gun too. Your gun knocking your ship over with each massive shell? Better add some recoil suppression to the cannon barrels.Do you like missiles? Big ones or small, fast, or slow, Fragmentation, Explosive or EMP? In the water? You bet you can make torpedoes! Mines? Check! Dumb fire bombs, Absolutly! Laser firing sharks tied to a rocket?!?!? Posi…wait, no you cant do that one, but maybe its in development.All weapon systems are modular (except simple weaopons).These systems are currentlyCannonsMissilesLasersAll of which can be customized to function in multiple ways.So, now you have your awesome first design? What do you do with it?Go play the campaign! You load onto a world named Neter where you have a tiny wooden fortress and a dinky little boats. In the campaign you gain resources by mining it in zones, so when you start you may not be able to afford your awesome boat you designed so you will have to go design a smaller cheapers boat (in campaign or in the designer)Now, you have this tiny sad little wood boat, probably with some missiles on it, what to do? Well, there 8 factions out there waiting to be destroyed or destroy you. You can control your boat yourself, or send it out to fight under the control of the ships AI, which you will need since you will have many ships in a fleet.  You are already at war with the Deep Water guard, and they are coming to get you. As you build up more resources by mining and destroying enemy ships you can in turn build up bigger ships of your own.So, now you've destroyed everything in Neter and you own the world? What do you do now?Well, a recent addition to FTD is the world Editor, here you can build your own world and your own factions to go blow up, or share the world with friends so they too can blow up YOUR world.This game has limitless potential, with a Developer who literally works WITH the community. I dont mean he reads suggestions, no he actually puts the design of enemy ships and enemy factions in the hands of the community and puts in new things based on the suggestions of the community. Give it a try, once you get the hang of it you will be rewarded over and over when you build something new and more awesome than your last creation. "

								This is how this game works. You buy the game, watch the tutorial, get excited, build your first ship, first ship sinks, you go back to the drawing board, you make improvements, Ship works YAY, you get excited, you spawn a small enemy ship, you blow it to bits, you feel accomplished you spawn 2 small enemy ships you blow them to bits, you start to have faith in your design, so you spawn a bigger enemy, and guess what happens there, YOU get blown to bits, you cry, rage quit the game and go to sleep, after all you've been playing for 7 hours straight. During your sleep, you get a dream about a new stronger design, you either wake in the middle of the night with excitement or wait untill morning, anyways, you construct your new improved and mighty ship, you spawn the bigger ship that blew you to bits hopeing for revenge, 20 seconds later you're inches away from breaking your monitor as your ammo caches gets hit by a stray shell from his cannon and makes a majestic explosion. You ralise, armour is the solution, so you go back to the drawing board and make the most armoured ship you can, you release it in the water....it sinks, you keep trying and it keeps sinking....you're frustratd, insecure, you have lost faith in your designs, you think you cant play this game anymore, but it's too late you already played 20 hours of it in the first 2 days, you realise you cannot give up. You then open ol' trusty google and youtube you scour them for as much information as you can. 7 hours of research later and a few physics lessons from your old school book read on the way. You become a ship building expert, you then use your new found knowledge to design the ultimate boat to crush your fearsome enemy and then...... SUCCESS!! You have sunk the enemy ship. You feel good about yourself, go fap and go to sleep all happy feeling like a worthy engineer. You wake up next morning thinking ""Hey, I wanna try my luck with the campaign"" You start the campaign, remember you still have some left over confidence from that battle in the designer mode, first thing that happens in the campaign, you get attacked by a dingy you feel even more confident and actually for a second believe you can win this campaign. 20 mins later, you get attacked by the Deep Water Guard Crazy Chicken Armada. You look at that vessel in disbelief, cursing the day you bought this game (which is about 3 days ago) and the Crazy Chicken blows you and you fleet to smithereens....you rage quit and you rinse and repeat the above.11/10 would buy again.

								Superb! Truly amazing amount of vehicles, fortresses, spaceships, warships, etc to create! In depth missile, engine, cannon,  and AI customization. Still learn something new every time I play it. Developer is very active in the forum and frequently updates the game. CPU intensive with large firefights / ships			"

								10/10 Would recommendI have never reviewed a game on steam before, Usually they don't hold my interest for too long (Except KSP). But I've enjoyed playing this game a lot. I've had this want for a deep physics based building combat game and when I saw this game back in January I was like WHOA NICK SMART YOU NEED TOTAKE MY MONEY RIGHT NOW. It has so many things to make and mess around with that it keeps me delightfully interested and curious, exploring new aspects of this massive sandbox. I have probably put around one hundred hours just making a large ship in the sandbox mode and having it face large ai ships. Watching as my watertight compartments become breached and seeing a rush of repair drones fly over frantically trying to keep the damage under control as the bow starts to sumberge, I continue to engage. A shell from an enemy heavy deck gun punches through the armor protecting my ships forward magazine, and the majority of the front deck of my ship disentregrates and flies everywhere with a huge explosion. My stern's array of 24 missile launchers fire possibly one last volley at the enemy battleship, and I score a hit on their fire control center, stopping their weapons from firing and giving me a small bit of time to do repairs to keep her floating.Of course if sandbox isnt your thing there are missions and campaign mode as well. Soon there will be multiplayer as well, and I think that will be amazing, considering the copius amounts of fun I have only against the AI.Cannons, guns, missiles, lasers, drills, rams... All are yours to build, and you don't just place them, you put down each block of that cannon to tailor its size, range, damage output, speed, and armor penetration to your liking. Check out Youtube videos of this game if you need more convincing, espically the AplhaMaster tournament to see some crazy designed ships/aircraft on a budget. I made a goliath cannon that ran the length of its hull, turning into a fireworks show when it was hit once. It was quite amusing.Theres something that the developer here does that almost no other early access game developers are doing: He actually works!! Wow! I have had a few buys of early access games that have become stagnant and unfinished, and that have not considered the players wants and suggestions (StarForge  I'm talking about you). I feel that the developers from some early access games have stolen my cash and everyone elses cash, making empty promises.  Not only do updates for From the Depths frequently come out with new content and fixes/optimisations, but Nick(the dev) is extremely active on the forums. It shows that he really cares about making this game for his players to enjoy. This is one of the few early access games that I can see the progress and feel satisfied that my money went to helping the developer make a game, not sit around.			"

								Day one I was so proud of myself because my boat floated.Day two I was so proud of myself because my boat moved...three, so proud my boat moved where I wanted it to....four, so proud my boat took out the simplest enemy with simple cannons....my boat is fitted with The Worlds Biggest Cannon and I shred through a four enemies.....I refit my boat into a destroyer with mega rocket torpedoes and can take out most sensibly sized boats one to one......I rig AI to my weapons and my boat becomes massively more deadly.......I rig AI to movement and my boat becomes self-aware........I launch a whole fleet of boats.........My fleet of boats is joined by a fleet of light helicoptersTomorrow? I think I need a new flagship... Maybe a space station? Or a giant submarine... Who knows!The learning curve isn't that bad either, despite there being a lot going on. Just focus on one thing at a time - don't look at helicopters until you've grasped boats (or vice versa). There's lots of (good) teaching material, and the creative mode editor is great to play around in. I suggest giving your character the cheats early on in creative mode as they will help you move around and deal with ""I really shouldn't have spawned that yet"" enemies (I'm inside your megaship, death raying your ai mainframez).I absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes creating stuff.

								The concept and depth of this game is huge. The only thing you are provided with in the campaign is a simple fort and a small boat. Everything else is up to you. you build your ships how you want to. Your cannons how you want too. want a long range Artillery gun or a rapid fire AA gun? Go ahead and piece it together and build it. want a submarie that fires torpedos or launches torpedos that turn into missiles? Piece it together how you want to.For me the game did take a couple youtube videos and about half a bottle of whiskey to really figure out how stuff works together to really make an effective ship. of my 20 something hours played so far probably 15 of it has been spent trying different designs of ships and weaponry to see what functions together well. But, that has been the best part.There really is no better feeling than building up a fleet of ships that you have created to watch them blow up the enemy in a battle and tear through the offensive lines.It is in early access and has a few minor bugs i've seen, but nothing really game breaking that i have discovered. The graphics are nice for a voxel based game. On both my PC and gaming laptop i have not discovered one second Under 30 FPS, it runs smoothe on my machines.All in all, buy this game, it really reminds me of a game i would have always wanted as a kid when all i had was legos.4.5/5  -  The only reason i wouldnt give this game 5 start is the lack of a tutorial or some explanations of certain things. Which really isnt a big deal because I'm fairly positive in beta or full release they will have a very nice in depth tutorial.			"

								This game is amazing and very playable even in its Alpha build. The scope and breadth of this sandbox is impressive. That's the short review.Pros:There is seemingly no limit to creativity and imagination when it comes to constructing real, functioning, capable vehicles of war in this world.There is no clear path to victory. If you want to conquer the world using only balloon airships equipped with lasers, you can. Subs? Surface fleets? Fortresses? No problem. Replayability is fantastic as a result.There are truly capable and complex engineering frameworks in place that allow you to make spectacular vehicles with discrete propulsion, offensive, and defensive systems.The graphics are playful and cell-shaded, which I usually detest. However in this case it works. The developer is active and working hard.Cons:Controls. This is not so much a con as a warning. The controls are GREAT for this game...once you learn them. They are not intuitive, but they are also no difficult to learn. If you want a more simpler ""Minecraft"" style of control, that is available as well. However I urge you to take an hour to become comfortable with the default control scheme, as it works exceedingly well once you grasp it.It's an Alpha. That means there are broken or disabled parts of the game, balance issues, and plenty of opportunities for optimization. However none of these are game breaking (IMO) at the moment.There is a LOT to learn. Seriously, you can spend a whole day just learning how to design cannons. Or lasers. Or engines. The cool part about this is that you will find that there are many many ways to engineer any of these, and you can have a lot of fun experimenting. But if you want a casual game where you won't find yourself looking up a tutorial on YouTube for how to contruct a laser-powered missile defense, this is not the game for you.I am truly obsessed with this game at the moment. Between this and 7 Days to Die, my crafting and survival urges are well cared for. I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in engineering or building your own contraptions. There is a learning curve, but it is a fun hill to climb.			"

								This is a variable thumbs up.  Which is to say, this game is not for everyone.  It appeals to a certain venn diagram demographic of people who grew up building castles with Legos and then finding ways to wreck them.  Which I imgaine is a pretty big group, it is true, but still isn't everyone.  Lucky for me I'm in that group.Be warned, however, that it requires that certain obsessiveness when it comes to building things most commonly seen in Minecraft players who live logged into the game from inside their life support pods, being feed through IV drips as they continue the sixth year of their quest to recreate, in 1-to-1 scale, the Taj Mahal and it's surrounding gardens.  If you're not that insane, however, you're in luck - the integrated Workshop is already overflowing with more prefab designs of varying degrees of ""That's no moon!"" than you can imagine, so honestly you'll never really have to design anything if you don't want to.  And if you are that kind of crazy, thanks!  We really appreciate all that neat stuff in the Workshop.  Well done!Then comes the fun part - destroying everything in sight.  Once you get your Insane Flying Battleship of Laser Doom finished it's time to head out and see what it's got.  Thankfully, do to an amazingly complex AI system, at this point you can just sit back and watch your engines of destruction curb-stomp inferior NPCs all day until you find yourself drooling and yelling ""Smash Beetles!""  Ah, but eventually the game difficulty will ramp up, the NPCs will start fielding their own doomships and from there the battles will look like a Minecraft rendition of ""Star Blazers"" as kilometer long dreadnauts butt heads against each other in battles worthy of Godzilla's applause.There is, of course, some downsides: If you're actually playing the campaign, good luck in actually getting any of those super-dooper ships assembled in anything less than five hours, because the gap between a player's campaign starting resource generation and the ambitions of the Workshop gnomes can be measured in parsecs.  Picking out the cheap, practical stuff can be a quest in itself... unless you want to make it yourself, and that leads to the other problem: The AI system.Woe to he who does not spend several hours learning the many intricacies of the AI modules & system, and I don't just mean the tutorial stuff.  Making AI do anything more complex than ""fly in circle and shoot stuffs"" requires something resembling actually programming ability, and is not for the faint of heart or lacking of scripting skills.  Mastering that can make building your first working laser cannon seem simple in comparison.However, again a lot of people who can handle that probably fall into the same venn diagram area I mentioned at the beginning of this review, so it's not that big of deal.  Yeah, the game almost requires a certain mindset but then it appeals most to that mindset to begin with.Now as for the ""Early Access"" thing: The campaign system still need some work but it's functinal.  In fact, everything in the game is functional right now.  From here my prediction is that development will simply be bug fixes and refining the many rough edges of what is already in the game.  Right now it's kind of like a perfectly functional car without any paint, trim or dashboard lights.			"

								This game is hard.  You will be frustrated.  You will sit there wondering ""why the hell isn't this working?"" for most of your early experience.  You will want to cry.  You will want to scream.  You will want to pull out your hair.  Then, suddenly, things will begin to make sense.  You'll build something that works, and you'll start to win battles.  You'll feel like a badass.  You'll advance across the map, blowing up ships and dismantling your enemies as your empire grows.Then you'll lose.  You'll push too far.  A goliath of unfathomable power will emerge over the horizon and annihilate that which you worked so hard to build all on its own.  You will want to scream.  It will be seemingly unbeatable and slowly reclaim the territory you so easily plundered before.  Your empire will be slowly crushed.  You'll look up tutorials and begin to learn.  You might download a few community designs and see if this monster of a craft can be destroyed.  You'll slowly whittle it down until it lies motionless in the water and you claim your phyrric victory.This experience will lead you to design new craft.  Upgrade your weapons.  Thicken your armor.  Power up your shields.  Soup up your engines.  You will be proud of this new craft, and it will perform admirably.  You'll take back what you lost and start to win against the monsters you awakened.  Then, it will hit you again.  Your new craft will begin to struggle against new and even more powerful enemies.  You'll begin to lose again, and you will learn again.This game is about losing, and learning how to overcome these losses.  It is merciless.  Your creativity means nothing to the terrors waiting for you.  This is From the Depths.			"

								I built a gigantic superplane that murders everything with one volley.First thing I did was allahu ackbar into a Marauder and instakill us both.10/10 Aloha snackbar simulator 2015EDIT: okay holy♥♥♥♥♥♥wow you guys really liked this review for some reason. I'll write a real one now.From the Depths (or FtD, as I shorten it to) is a game where you build ships, tanks, planes, spaceships, space stations, flying fortresses, and submarines, among other fantastical sh!t you can make. The building, while originally counterintuitive and clunky to new players, quickly becomes engrained in the muscles, making it very easy to begin building once you master the controls and read a few guides.Gameplay- 9/10The game plays incredibly; it's fun, relaxing, and exciting all at the same time, depending on what you happen to be doing. It is, however, marred by occasional frame issues. I myself have not had many, but I have built myself a godrig, so consider your hardware carefully before puchasing.Audio- 6/10Arguably the weakest part of the game, the audio and soundtrack (of which there is none at time of writing) is very generic, with almost copy-pasted wave crashing effects, firing sounds, and propeller and engine sounds droning on. Many people, among them myself, have learned to ignore it, but it still is a weak point in an otherwise good game. It will most likely be rectified as the game progresses (it is an alpha, after all).Visuals/Graphics- 8/10The game doesn't look terrible, despite its indie roots and early dev. stage. In fact, many of the best looking areas in gaming that I have seen come from me dicking around on small skiffs on the highest graphical setting. Most of the time, however, it looks fairly standard. As stated above, it might challenge some older/weaker PCs, but it will, most likely, be fixed over time.Overall- 8/10The game is a quirky, fun, and addicting building game, where the inner engineer in you can come out to play in a voxel based world, where very little cannot be overcome by a little bit of thinking. It's very new, however, and may seem rough to those not familiar with it. The price point, another weak point, hovers around $20. It is worth it, but be careful, and seriously consider what type of gamer you are. Also you can aloha snackbar. That part was pretty great.			"

								EDIT: My old review is below the ""="" line.At the time of the old review, the developer was working alone. After nearly two years of monitoring and being a part of the community, It's much stronger than I reviewed before.The developer has even hired members of the community to assist development! (!!!)(Before you ask, no, I'm not a member of the staff, and this is an entirely voluntary review.)Currently the community is working together to fill in all of the content for the game, even one of the available worlds in the game currently has been made from scratch by devout members of the community.Keep in mind that every ship you fight in the current campaigns have been designed by members of the community, with a rigid review and revision process seen on the forums.Those that are vocal on the official forums have an influence in the development. There are active debates over future changes to the game as you are reading this.I wholeheartedly recommend the hell out of this game, especially if you've a mind for engineering.====================================================================This is an absolutely, positively magnificent game. Don't scroll down just yet, I have an explanation for my madness.This is an engineering game with block style building and heavy sandbox elements. One could say that this is like Space Engineers, but there's something different. The craft you build serve a point. There's a dynamic, open world war-like campaign that you must build and design craft for (or snipe them off of the workshop and learn how they work,)  to complete.In this campaign you'll be introduced to several factions with vessels that are very different per faction (The developer is currently taking user submissions that fit a certain faction's theme) that you must design crafts that can combat this.I keep saying the word ""craft"" in place of boat because it can be anything. Boats, planes, land vehicles, spacecraft, ballooncraft, submarines, anything you can design can come to life in this with its simple automation that you can put in place.While this game, at the time of the review, has a small-but-growing community, it is VERY robust, there has to be the highest ratio of players that are also streamers and youtubers to regular players I've ever seen. There's loads of tutorials and user submitted designs on the official forums (don't let the Steam forums decieve you.)And for those holdouts that are concerned about the longevity and developer-community relations on this product, the developer is very active on the official forums, with, to date, 18% of all the total posts on the forums being his. He constantly throws out suggestions that he wants to see in the game to gauge community reaction as well as take in any well-thought-out revisions that the community members have to offer. There's even been a quote of him saying ""I can put it in, people just need to ask for it."" When it comes to longevity, it used to be just him on the project, but I've seen some more people come on as official staff.This is a hidden gem. I want the world to see it. My rating? 15 out of 10.			"

								I shied away from this game a bit when I read that it was ""complicated."" Then, it went on sale and I thought ""It can't be more complicated than setting up a military in dwarf fortress,"" and it isn't. From the Depths is a complex game, but it is not that complicated. At the time of this review, I've spent only two hours playing it, and feel that I have a basic understanding of the mechanics available. I havn't touched any of the guns yet though, so we will see.In my two hours;I watched a tutorial on mouse controls, it was all very straight foreward, and by the end of the 6 minute video I felt I was ready for some basic gameplay.I played with the sandbox ""spawn a ship and test it's effectiveness"" thing, which was fun time for about 15 minutes and served to get me acquainted and interested with what the fights would be like, but didn't really tell me much about how it would all work, so...I went to select the campaign, but was met with a popup stating, basically, ""are you sure you want to just jump in? The games kind of complex, maybe you want to start with the build a ship sandbox? just until you feel you are ready?"" I liked that, so I went to build something in the safety of the sandbox.I spent about an hour and a half in the sandbox, generally getting used to how it controlled, playing around with blocks an then decided I wanted my raft to move. I went into the build menu, clicked the button that said ""engines"" and noticed two red flashing boxes. I clicked one, and it was a guide on how to build a simple engine. ""well thats nice"" I thought, and using the guide I built a small single cylinder engine. after checking the guide again to see what I did wrong (becuase it didn't work) I realized that I had installed everything on the wrong end of the engine block and so corrected the problem. before moving my ship, I wanted to stabalize it. as a simple wooden raft, it rocked about horribly on the oceans swell and with the new engine making it a bit top heavy, it only got worse. I endeavored then to build a pair of outriggers and expand the main body of the ship a bit to make it more stable and bouyant. To my immense pleasure, it worked and I drove my small boat, no longer a pathetic raft, around in circles for a bit before deciding that ""From the Depths"" is not nearly as difficult as playing dwarf fortress, no where close to as complicated as people say it is, and that I would rather like to play more of this very nice ship building game.

However, because of the latest changes it's lost one of the great appeals it had for me, and I myself will not be playing the game again, which is a real shame.However, I'll still recommend it for what it is now - a building and combat simulator. It does this really well, but unfortunately due to some of the latest updates, that's all it's become.There used to be things like resource management, fuel management, rarer materials which forced you to build with weaker materials until you could secure better materials, but apparently people whined about not being able to build their huge massive holy crap ships from the word go, heaven forbid, which ate up much of their metal, and so the developer merged all resources into one. Instead of planning how to secure the materials you need/want to build the ships you want and taking over territories based on this - it's now a game of kill everything and do it however you want in any order because it doesn't matter anymore.For example - there used to be fuel, ammo, along with metal, wood, and crystal. This in itself seemed perfectly fine - crystal being a rarer material and more difficult to secure. Fuel and Ammo being separated so if you didn't produce enough of either, you're in trouble. Now, there's no more production of ammo or fuel. All is a single resource, and the whole game is focused around combat alone. Gone are the days of securing resource sites that had stronger resources of metal or crystal to up your supply. That strategic element is gone. Gone are the days of saving up and building smartly with the materials you have available to overcome your enemies. With but one resource, a whole section of the game has been over simplified and it's lost a huge appeal because of it, at least for me. The complexity and planning was one of the things I loved most about it.For many people this is will be a big deal. I told my friend about it and he's agreed - he no longer wants to play simply based on this change alone. We both feel the game is now easy mode. Combat, nothing more.However, it does combat really well. There's great complexity and depth with the ship building itself, even if there's really no point in having materials at all anymore. I'm not entirely sure why the developer even has resources at this point. I do however still recommend the game for the combat alone, even if that's not enough to keep me playing it.			"

								Are you willing to spend 1-2 hours learning this game?If so, it will become your Skyrim. It will become your World of Warcraft. It will suck your life away. You will think of new designs, new crazy things to build, weapon systems to obliterate your opponents and AI systems that can get the job done under any circumstance.You will reminisce the possibilties of fleet management, what forces you need where - which resource zones you need to suckle upon to better your advances against the incoming factions. You will bribe with oil and crystal, why be enemies when you can be friends? And then you will backstab the very faction you befriended, because this is From The Depths and you need all the precious resources you can get.When you are taking a shower, you will contemplate just how to get your orbital bombardment of custom made ICBM's raining down on your rivals with unprecedented insanity and accuracy. You will ponder over your cruiser and if you really need those massive drills spinning at 50k RPM on the front, do you really need to drill into every enemy ship and watch them explode in majestic fashion? Yes, the answer is always yes.You will board enemy ships and attempt to destroy whatever you can with the weapons of your choice. Minigun? Hrmm, maybe. Grenade launcher? Yes... that feels right. Blow up their mainframes, disrupt their AI connections, take out their command center, or just launch into the ammo storage and watch the fireworks. Every part of this game is destructable, and this makes me smile.I own a lot of titles on steam, and this is my new Skyrim.			"

								Well,well,well So I decided to make a Review nobody is ever gonna read but I do not care! From the Depths is a game about Building.Very much building.Very complex building.And it takes really much time to learn.Where to begin? Lets start with the things you ever wanted -Building Custom Cannons,Missiles,Torpedos,etc.I mean how awesome is that?-Design own Ships (Well I am quite uncreative and my first trys were desasters ,but hey, its fun to see how your way to fast ship brings up its nose and drives 40 metres per second)Now the things you may never really thought you need,but are still cool -Engine Building-Incredible much time to build a ship (and nervs) (at the beginning)-Physics-Different Factions-A game that never really ends,just like Mount and Blade titlesAbout negative aspects.......There are no really important thingsMy rating for this game is 9/10 because nothing is perfect....Not even YOU who read that born-of-bored thing here(Small thing for the Devs,add to ability to make more than one block at the same time like here

You've got dinghies to dreadnoughts, harpoons to homing missiles, and light aircraft to laser beams at your disposal. This is a game that can bring out both the strategist and engineer in all of us.			"

It is worth understanding it though, watching the carnage of your creations does bring a very fulfilling sense of achievement. THIS GAME WILL BUILD THE ENGINEER CHILDREN OF THE FUTURE.Edit: After looking at even more countless YouTube tutorials, I think I have a good idea on how to play the game. As for who to look for to help, I recommend channels such as EnterElysium, Lathland, or ireLAN Gaming. Those guys really showed me how to play, since most of the learning in this game is done by seeing.			"

								This is a preliminary review.I spent the first 40 hours playing around in the sandbox mode, and completing the 40 tutorials.To say this game has a steep learning curve would be a grave understatement.I have not known a more complex vehicle design game, in over 20 years of gaming.This means an amazing amount of customization, while at the same time, a daunting challenge.This is a game for players who are willing and capable of learning immense amounts of information, in order to be able to play competantly.At this point, I have not completed what I would consider an adequate ship, and do not expect to in the near future, let alone a plane or ground vehicle.There is a great deal of potential in this game, for those willing to study, and experiment.Development is ongoing, and seems very well focused.If there is a weakness inherent in the game, it is the lack of  smooth learning, and building transitions.Rather than a progressive tutorial, that teaches players through building a functional ship, there are 40 separate tutorials that feel much like homework.Rather than being able to define and modify discreet components, and prioritize their construction or repair order, the game is much more Minecraft-esque, carrying the limitations of difficulty editing nested compnents, and little suggestion/contextual assistance in building.I have not yet explored the Workshop, though I have seen some interesting designs and tutorials.The building interface and menus are not the most friendly, but they are the most comprehensive, as far as freedom-of-design.A background in engineering and/or programming is a real benefit, with psuedo-realistic physics, and LUA  programming options.This should be approched more as educational entertainment, than mind-numbing warfare, for the best experience.I both look forward to, and gaze apprehensively upon, all that I will learn in order to rise ""From the Depths"".Cheers.

								Day 1: Dear Diary, today I got a game about ships. The first one I built kept capsizing. I've learned about buoyancy, keels, material density, and surface area in regards to its correlation with stability.Day 2: Dear Diary, my boat floats but flips over when I turn the engine on. Today I learned about center of mass, thrust, and compartments. Day 3: Dear Diary, my boat is now capable of maneuvering. I've attached a gun to it. Today I learned about auto-feeders, ammunition, turrets, azmith, and not to point the barrel too far down when firing across the bow.Day 4: Dear Diary, today I tried to automate my guns. They shot a hole through the front of the ship while trying to track a submarine in combat tests. I learned about failsafes, weapon control, AI cards, and that the AI would rather back up towards a target than complete a turn to use forward propulsion in an approach vector.Day 5: Dear Diary, today I applied for a Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering with MIT despite only having 30 credit hours. I sent footage of From the Depths along with my application. Today one of my shells bounced against an enemies armor, came back, entered through a hole I keep in the deck to get to the engine, and hit my ammunition cache causing the entire belly of the ship to blow out. In unrelated news, I need a new monitor and learned about armor sloping and angling.			"

								Starting out in From The Depths can be a discouraging experience, the amount there is to learn may seem overwhelming but is met with some of the most rewarding results I've come across in the vehicle crafting sandbox genre. This is a game that requires patience to be put in but gives back in copious amounts, learning the usage of every tool is key to creating the most enjoyable experience as you'll have plenty to use at your disposal.First and foremost, every player from the curious new builders to the most seasoned of engineers will want to delve into the playable tutorials and building guides supplied by the game as you'll quickly find the learning curve is no joke. Although it may seem tedious at first the more patient of players will begin to slowly learn important hotkeys and shortcut tools such as copying and reusing large sections of previously created vehicles that will make your building endeavors quick, seamless, and enjoyable.  Creating vehicles is way more than just their visual appearance and basic form, you'll have to get into the guts of each machine and engineer their inner-workings putting you in full control of everything from connecting series of logic up to thrusters, distributing equal amounts of power evenly across your ship, to creating your own missiles and ammunition as well as defining their behavior. The limits in From The Depths are determined solely by your own creative capacity. Aside from the vehicle creation and building mode, there are some ambitious features to battle it out in including a progressive campaign that expands with each update and quick skirmishes you can set up for testing your new creations in the heat of battle. Terrain in the game varies from sea, to land, to air/space giving you lots of types of traversable landscape to consider when creating your specific dream vehicle. The campaign itself is impressively engrossing for those well versed in the mechanics of the game throwing you into the world with a starting base to gather resources from and expand off of as you fight for survival and resourceful territories. This campaign mode is already very addictive and continues to grow rapidly with each update, promising the addition of more enemies, factions and objectives to spice up your survival in this free-form sandbox adventure.Currently in development is the story based mission mode but it already features a couple of the basic starting missions which I found to be some of my most exhilarating moments with the game. The few story missions we have already do a great job of setting you up with some pre-determined scenarios, getting you into an operable pre-made vehicle and dropping you into the midst of a full-scale battle. These missions are a really excellent way to get a glimpse at what all-out war looks like in From the Depths.Considering the complexity of what you can do and the scope of freedom you have doing it, From the Depths is a game I feel deserves way more attention and hype from sandbox and crafting enthusiasts. For me it's certainly the next biggest sandbox game on the market and one I've already put more time into than KSP or Space Engineers, and the prospects shown from constant updates and a very close relationship between the developer and the community make it even more important to get involved early to watch something already engrossing turn into something huge.

								TL;DR : Genius.The game works, as a game, and it runs incredibly smoothly considering the astounding complexity on display.The base vehicle AI (i.e. not counting the LUA scripts one can implement) is surprisingly flexible and isn't much of an obstacle in the way of your imagination.As complex as the game may be, it's very approachable and easy to learn.Do use the default ""keyboard"" controls vs. the ""mouse"" ones. The game implies they are long/hard to learn that is a lie.Do use the symetry feature for symetric vessels ;) .Do familiarize yourself with the basics in the vehicle designer before attempting a campaign. Why not?In all my hours of gameplay I haven't yet touched the campaign (though I feel that I could, at any time... it's just that there's so many designs to build and test, and so little time! Oh the misery.)Start small. Keep an eye on your craft's center of mass. A lot revoles around that (pardon the pun).Thus place your means of propulsion appropriately; for small adjustments to the center of mass I recommend lead blocks.Learn only a few systems at a time in order to not get overwhelmed.(So don't be discouraged if you fail to build a working airship armed with every type of weapon as a first build.)You'll get there sooner rather than later, and nothing can compare to the satisfaction you'll feel when one of your cherished design performs better than intended and obliterates similarly priced stock vessels.I'm still in awe such a game actually exists. It's still in early access, sure, but each major update introduces new systems or improves upon a previous one, and it just works so well. Walking around on a very fast-moving and unstable vessel can feel a little jerky at times, but only because you've become habituated to how smooth it feels in every other situation. Anyhow, navigating a ""sinking"" airship feels appropriately cataclysmic, and I know of no other game that can deliver a similar experience with such fidelity.As I said earlier, it just -works-, and the amazing (yet very approachable) complexity of the systems on display is an incredible stimulus for your imagination.The game, even at this (early?) stage, truly lives up to its premise. If you have any doubts, there are a few youtube Let's Plays floating around; Lathland and Rosefall come to mind, but there are others of equal quality which I shall not name here because I am lazy. I've learned quite a few tricks watching their videos!Great/10			"

								Out of all the vehicle building games around I played a lot of (Space Engineers, Empyirion Galactic Survival, Starmade) I have to say, this one is my favorite.You can do so much! At the time I wrote this review, you could do: Ships, Hydrofoils, Hovercrafts(Well, technically. But there's no hovercraft skirt parts right now, just thrusters and propellers), Submarines(those are a bit trickier to get working AI wise), Aircrafts, Airships, Spacecrafts, Helicopters(Those are tricky to make too), and they just added land vehicles(Still rough around the edges, and not very usable in combat, but some fun can be had with those already).Or, you can get creative and just abuse the physic engine to make weird contraptions :BThe game relies mainly on AI to control the vehicles/structures you build in the game. The AI is still a bit wonky, especially path finding and collision avoidance, but its possible to minimize the problems using long range weapons and spreading your ships around in formations. However, it'll always find a way to use whatever you give it..Another nice thing is that, your creation can be controlled in battle using a strategic map view, which makes things much easier.Manual controls are available, but, right now they're very limited, convoluted, and not very practical for anything that's more than a simple basic ship. And even then, there's some weirdness with it. However, I'm pretty sure the devs are definitely going to fix those in a way or another before release. The build mode is probably one of my favorite part of this game. I'm talking about Keyboard mode. Its really efficient and handy most of the time. Most people seems to say it has a high learning curve, but personally I figure it out under 2 hours, after watching the video tutorial. And I usually have issues with different control schemes in games. (Actually, the vehicle steering controls are more confusing than this tbh)Sure its a bit intimidating at first, but try messing around with it, not building anything serious. Your first ship will probably be a complete piece of junk that keeps sinking on its own, or capsizing but try watching getting started tutorial videos by Irelan gaming for example, you'll understand a lot better how to make things work. Or you can also just spawn ships/vehicles from the campaign and take them apart and see how they managed to make them float/fly/etc and work.One thing I love particularly here is the way you can customize almost every system you build with attachements and extensions. Nearly all systems are multi-blocks. And not just in a quantitative way, like Starmade for example(AKA more blocks == more powerful) Building large systems without powerful enough support systems to back them up will yield a pretty innefective system. It'll still work, but you could do better use of your space.For instance, you can build a huge engine, but it'll drink so much fuel at mid and low RPMs compared to several smaller engines that turn on and off to meet demands that you'll get a very fuel hungry design with a very weak spot. And well, there's also overheating to take into account, but its pretty manageable, even though radiators are pretty shoddy right now.Of course, you can do that with way more things than just engines! Weapons systems, propellers, etc.. And probably more in the future. You can build canons from the magazine to the tip of the barrels. You assemble each parts together to get the best out of the space you have, while making sure a single shell won't find a way to hit your magazines and blow everything up! And you can customize your shells, build gauss canons, add timed/proximity detonation and a lot more! The recent weapon and armor rebalance did a pretty solid job at balancing out the game. AKA you can't sink a big floating metal castle ship armored with 2 to 5m of armor, with an army of tiny ships with 20mm chainloaded AP guns anymore :PSome things are still a bit overpowered though, and some things definitely need some work. Namely UI, engine and power mechanics, shields, player weapons, land vehicles, space vehicles and the physics involved with going to space.But, from what the devs teased, there's a lot of great improvements coming soon. And even in this state, the game is a ton of fun. Playing the campaign and designing your ships, or refitting any enemy ships you manage to capture, sending massive fleets against an enemy's forces is already tons of fun IMO. The devs are overall doing amazing work with this game! They listen to feedback, keeps asking questions and mentioning what they're working on in the forums, and release patches and content regularly. (During early access at least)			"

								A crafting game in which you will never punch a tree or heft a pickaxe against a rockface. Instead it puts you in an RTS: you want resources, you better go take them from the AI-controlled factions, either by conquering resource point areas and putting automated drilling platforms on them, or just ripping their ships apart as salvage. You, know: fun.The game is still under very active development, which is a mixed blessing. Replacing custom cannons with CRAM cannons, and making the drag model more realistic, made the game more fun, but you need to be prepared for a ship that was awesome yesterday to need rework to be effective tomorrow. Nick, the developer, *is* good at making sure they still load in and do best-effort conversions, so you can tweak rather than rebuild from start---important, given building a good battleship can take you a weekend's play.Nick is pretty active on the forum. He tends to pick up serious bug reports pretty quick, but there's the risk that as always the fanbase constantly pressures for more difficulty, more complexity (without actually introducing more intersting decisions), more dilution of a design just to have more everything. Such is early access.Philosophically, this is a nerd game. It doesn't have difficulty levels: it has a pair of difficulty sliders that control different scaling factors. If you want the AI to stop throwing the controls to full lock every time it's a fraction off-course, you'd better learn to start tuning a PID controller. You can control some things with Lua, although not as thorougly as I'd like yet---you can't *quite* replace the stock AI with it. Lua missiles are currently as gods to their lesser, built-in-guidance bretheren. You don't *need* to do any of this, and there's a lot of effort put into getting you going with simpler subsets, but this is game that's not shy about giving you parameters to tune.It's ugly, and the dirty, rusty, outlined art-style can make it hard to identify blocks at first. The UI is pure programmer, weirdly positioned buttons and the occasional bizzare workflow (like having to manually save workshop items to disk). The physical nature of battles can make it pretty attractive in motion, though, missiles streaking through the air as a ship rips in half from a huge ammo explosion.The build tools are pretty good. It's got arbitrary symmetry and plane-fills, saveable prefab regions and subobjects, and the recommended keyboard-based mode is pretty slick once you've got used to it. Ships themselves are instanceable in the strategy game proper, and remember how they used to be before they were damaged, so repair is automatic once enabled even if they were completely destroyed. This is not a game about manual labour; this is a game about designing machines of war and using them to conquer the world.Seriously, though. You'll lose a weekend doing combat trials on that battleship.			"

								probably the best game ever.went into battle with a borodino battleship, thought it could use more guns, built more guns on the deck during combat and it rocks.took a ww2 light cruiser and added two nuclear missiles to its sides that go off to target enemies when in combat...made a submarine that fires a 150mm gun from below the sea.used replicas of vessels and vehicles ranging from russo-japanese war era to ww2 with montana/bismarck/yamato/ practicaly all the designs of cruisers and destroyers of the entire US, UK, german and IJN fleets of ww2, also used the dragon from the movie avatar, the p1000 rattle, and basically any plane, ship, sub, spaceship, flying shield heli carrier that i can think of- from halo frigates to freespace fighters, from star wars to flying zeppelin aircraft carriers with hundreds of guns on them and all of this is controlled by an ai that is simple to put on a vehicle(two blocks and thats it) and once its on its completely autonamus. this means that you can actually stand on the deck of one of your ships and just watch the battle unfold or take command yourself although the ai will almost certainly aim far better then you would.so long story short:build your own combat vehicles and tune them to your liking instead of getting predefined units like in other strategy games- checkdecide not only the number of guns on a ship but also how they look like and operate, i.e more barrels, less recoil, faster loading speed and gauge-checkbuild the components thatll make up the shell that your guns would fire- checkallow guns to have multiple autoloaders that each can fire a different kind of round- checkdesing the vehicles engine and power output to fit its role and use RTG's to give extra power to the vehicle shields- checkcrush your opponents with no unit build limit what so ever and the only limit in the camapin is how many ships can simultaniously spawn while in combat- meaning two fleets of 50 ships each clashing would mean that not all 50 ships of each fleet spawn together, some will need to die first for the rest to spawnand many more features....its the game i probably have been waiting for for 15 years and anyone who ever thought that customization and strategy is a good combination needs to own this game.

Search YouTube for how to build things or get a few ships off the Steam workshop and disect them.When I first got this game I didn't look at how to build things or looked at any of the in-game tutorials. Big mistake! I ended off shelfing the game for a few months. Only to un-shelf it later when I was bored and nothing in my library looked good. Until I saw From the Depths, still downloaded and installed. I loaded it up, this time looked at a tutorial or two and never looked back.This game makes the top 5 games I've ever played, and it's not even done yet!Get it!			"

								An absolutely fantastic building game based around combat vehicles. You can build ships, planes, submarines, airships, helicopters, spaceships and pretty much anything else you can think of. There is a beautiful amount of customization in this game. You can build your own engines, cannons, missiles, lasers and jets from individual components. Sloped armor and angling makes a difference in this game. Shells that hit at an odd angle are more likely to ricochet. The size of the cannon and the kind of ammunition can change how easily a shell can bounce.It is very stable for an early access game. I've never crashed once.Definitely recommended to anyone who likes block-based building and vehicular combat!			"

								Why do we strive to make the best games possible, making sure it outdoes the last. The video game industry is a mere star, gaining too much mass, creating over complicated, over expensive pieces of ""art"", over and over, until eventually...Puff; there it goes, collapsing in upon itself, crashing everything it created and everything around it... This game subsides that standard, putting art into something cheap, fun, not too complicated, just perfect. A game is a star; the larger it is, the more popular it is, which in this case, is how bright it is. This game, however, is a white dwarf; smaller than most, but one of the brightest out there. Well done Brilliant Skies. You have created a masterpiece, this is the Sirius-B of games. I thank you for creating something so beautiful. Thank you.			"

								When I first saw this game I thought that it was going to be another ""Get wrecked by everything because nothing tells you how to do anything"" games. So, one friday I figure, what the heck, I'll try it out. What's the worst thing that could happen. So I started playing. It was alot easier to pick up than I thought, yet, way more fun than I anticipated. I started out and just tried making a few different ships, got campaign going. Aaaaannnd...It's 2 O'Clock monday morning. If you like build'em to fight'em games. It's a must have. 9.5/10			"

								I love this game! I always had a thing for naval combat, and this game delivers that in spades. You can take to the skies, the sea, under the sea, in space, and even on land now. However, there are a few things that concern me.The part that hooked me the most is the building. It's not some Minecraft or Space Engineers clone, no. Building has all sorts of customisable elements that allow for endless creativity. While there are simple one click placement weapons and things, the game's true power comes alive with the various customisable cannons, missiles, and even engines. Every cannon, missile, engine, etc. have multiple components that determines how it functions and what it can be used for. Even the ammo is customisable. Even in its early access state, the game has balance in it's own way; in order to have a big gun you need a big ship, there is just no way around that. Some issues exist, like under-powered torpedoes. But in the end, how you build will determine how you emerge from combat.Combat is perhaps, either a weakness or a strength of the game: Combat is decided by your skill in the build designer, not your skill on the battlefield. Combat is resolved almost exclusively through AI control with very limited tactical input. Boarding and capturing ships, while possible, is made nearly impossible for most parts of the game. Many ships have multiple AI cores (destroy these captures it) hidden across the ship, then buried beneath umpteen layers of armor. Still, the combat is satisfying with well though out victory mechanics.Probably what concerns me the most is the developer's focus in making the game. Every new patch brings new balance fixes and parts, which is all very good. But, each patch also brings out new world maps, all of them incomplete. Even the most complete of the worlds has parts of it that say ""to be written"". So it seems to me that the devs keep making new stuff without finishing what they already have. This makes me question whether the main world will ever be completed at all. The campaign also gets tedious once your on a roll. Essentially you battle enemies in a map tile to gain control of it, then repeat for the next, and the next, and the next, until you reach the enemy base. Then repeat again.However, when things get tedious, I just build something new; his is firs and foremost a building game. Then take my new ship (or submarine, plane, fort, tank, airship, or spaceship) back in there for a fresh new change in the mode of battle.			"

Take the workshop as a nexample, it's definitely possible!Battles are cool and dynamic, waves play a big role as well as the functional build of your ship.Check out my video review for a more user friendly explanation of the game:

								I bought this game during the steam sales, thinking it was a nice little 3-4€ bargain that I would play for a few days.Boy was I wrong.From my first awful wooden ship with barely enough engine power to move forward, to enormous death juggernauts of doom I build now, I have fun every time.I sometimes just think of a clever little idea during the day, load the game really quickly to try it out, usually fail miserably, and have a good laugh doing it. The game is update regularily, the only time I've seen it crash was that time I spawned two ships that could be Warhammer 40K canon and made them duke it out, and that's only because my potato of a computer just couldn't keep up with the carnage.Beginners pick up the game quite fast, and all the little, harder to master things are details, so don't hinder new players from enjoy the game, and you learn constantly from your machines and the pre-built selection of ships.As for the avid coders? You're in luck! The game allows you to tweak integrated AI functions (like navigation). A little search through the forums and I saw people making scripts for hovercrafts, spaceships and even smart flares to counter missiles more effectively.TL;DR This game is fun, addictive and you can build so many, many things. Yes, even a giant phallus that shoots out explosive shells. I know you're going to do it, so why lie? "

								if you like games where creativity, physics, and sandbox functions are the top priority, such as kerbal space program, then you will absolutely LOVE this game. and with so many ways to play its easy to see why I can spend hours upon hours playing FTD. Nick Smart (the AWESOME guy that made this game) is incredibly active on the forums and listens to the smallest request from people, for instance I noticed something was misspelled so I sent him a message on the ftd forums and within 10 minutes he replied back saying it was fixed and thanks for letting him know. and sure enough, I checked steam and there was an update and the misspelled item was fixed. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone.			"

								Do you want a game like Space Engineers, but more advanced? This is it. This game may not have the good looking models and meshes of other games as it sticks to a purely voxel motif, but even in the stage of development it feels more complete than other titles in the genre. The developer is exceptionaly active and pushes updates often. From the Depths does have a learning curve that is complicated by a sometimes confusing GUI and strange keyboard controls. The things you can do in it make those negative points seem very small. It has a campaign that is difficult and rewarding as you move and construct bases and design ships on a large overworld map while fighting multiple enemy factions.If you enjoy creative building games at all then I would highly recommend it.

								I don't even remember when I got this game. I remember I got it way back when there was only one cannon type, the blocks looked like garbage, and it was much rougher. I now have become devoted religiously to this game. I can not sleep at night. I want to build more. I want to watch more battles. I want more, basically, and I have been late to work/school/other important things because I just have to get this ONE weapon system done. Then before I know it my eyes are on fire and my mouth is hanging open with drool dribbling out because I have been at it nonstop for hours building an armada the Royal Navy would be jealous of. The customization in this game is off the charts. Literally every single component of your vehicle is custom assembled out of blocks. The smallest corvettes and PT boats to the biggest battleships all start with a single block, and are built from there. The weapon systems and other such components are amazingly well designed, and are very intuitive once you learn them. The satisfaction of blowing off a ship's superstructure or ripping out her guts with an ammo detonation is just... intoxicating. Watching a battleship rock as she fires her massive main battery cannons is an amazing sight to behold. The graphics are... well, I like them, but they are not ground breaking. I think they are good. It runs well, and crashes rarely. Though, take that with a grain of salt, as I spent way too much money hand crafting a PC. It is an ambitious game, and the dev seems competent enough in fixing bugs and improving the game. I simply love it. I sink every free hour I have into it, trying to get better and finally whip the Deepwater Guard into submission.---So why is this review in red? Did I hit the wrong button? No. No I did not. While I love this game, and many others probably think the same, I know it has problems. These may be problems that will end up killing it. Why is it still in Alpha? It has been a really long time. Where is the game going? There are new blocks, new graphics, but that all helps the sandbox. The campaign is pretty much the same as it ever was, just a few new and unbalanced modes have been added. Why is it so darned difficult? Difficulty is not a bad thing but it feels like the starting designs could be toned down a little. That is this game's biggest flaw.It is too darned difficult. It is difficult for new players, it is difficult for seasoned players, and it shouldn't be that way. Getting into the game is not as simple as booting it up and starting a tutorial. The tutorials are often poorly worded and rushed. Some effort has been made to improve that recently, but with not so impressive results. The first boat you try to build probably won't even float or fire. It will likely roll over and sink. If it doesn't do that, the first enemy that sees it will blow it in half and not even blink. After a few dozen (more likely hundred) hours, your boats might actually get a couple of hits in before being ripped apart in a massive explosion.It is massively guilty of a cardinal sin of game design: It makes you go outside of the game to learn basic things. It is fine if you have to go watch a YouTuber play to learn how to build better, but to have to do that to learn how to build at all? A big no no. It drives away new players, which is what any game needs to survive. Only a select few can get over the insane learning cliff this game has and push on to become ""good"". That is bad. Really bad. It needs to be helped, and the more updates come out the more obvious that issue is mostly being ignored. I am a Naval nerd. I love reading about ships, reading about naval battles, that sort of thing. This game caters to a sort of niche, and I guess I am in that niche, to some degree. However, most people are not tinkerers or nerds or geeks who like to be hit over the head and smacked on the knuckles and go at it again, to chip away at the cliff of difficulty. A lot of people don't even know how fishing boats work and some might not even know what hydrodynamics mean, or what rangefinders are, or what a citadel or barbette is in boat terms. Many people just want to get a boat built and stand half a chance in battle, and that is a big achievment in this game when it shouldn't be. This game, for how much I love and worship it, is missing out on that point, and its going to start hurting it badly sooner or later. So with that, I have to, with great pain, give it a thumbs down. If you are willing to undergo the brutal initiation ritual of the FtD cult, then by all means, click that buy button and get ready for many curses, tears, and maybe even some blood and broken equipment. If you think that is too much, then you are not alone. Feel free to wander off and try something else.			"

								At a quick glance this just looks like another one of those block building games but this game has more to it than others like minecraft or space engineers. you can build ships, submarines, aircraft, spacecraft, and others if you are good enough. the interesting thing is there is a lot more to the games systems than building a chassis and tossing a few guns on it. the weapons are not just prefabricated and instead get you to build the gun and its internals, you also need to build all the components to things like engines and lasers. missiles can be fully equipped with all sorts of different components to be used for different roles, if you chose poor locations for these components be prepared to face the issues (like inefficient engines or ineffective poorly built missiles).also you need to worry about physics, build a small chassis with heavy duty weaponry and you have yourself a top heavy ship. poor construction can lead to all sorts of flaws like flipping under high speed or unintended tilting. at the same time the physics is still pretty forgiving, you can make some insane aircraft designs and they will still take flight.the vehicles can also be fully controlled with AI and using the LUA (provided you know how to use LUA) blocks some very complex actions can be used. because of AI control you can use fleets of ships and well as combat enemy ships. the AI is surprisingly good and can adapt to pretty well every design unless its really insane, if you find/make some lua code that can do that function though then the problem is solved. its quite refreshing to see a block building game that actually has enemy creations to fight against rather than just a few mobs like in most of these styles of games.Pros:- detailed building system rewards planning and creative design.- highly customizable parts add all sorts of variety and possibilties.- huge amount of designs in the game ranging from boring basic ships to wild laser flying battleships. these designs are also used by the different factions in the game.-massive replay value.Neutral:- fictionalized physics, its good enough so that most things that can happen in real life can happen in game. most of the fictional physics come in the form of aircraft being very forgiving. if you enjoy sci-fi stuff you may be fine, realism lovers may be ticked off by it though.- fast paced gameplay focused on large amounts of spammy weapons. its fun but lacks tactical positioning because the battle is usually over within minutes. most of the tactics depends of what you bring into battle rather than how you assemble formations and advances. battles are fast rather than long crossfires where every maneuver counts.- graphics can be a turnoff for some, the games style is steam-punk like.Cons:- as expected with early access things can be expected to be unstable. if you push things a little bit you can expect crashes.- i dont have anything else to say for cons. look at the neutral section and decide if any of those are cons for you.

								From the good of voxel building games and homage to the building spirit alike, this is a tinkering title you must have in your library. Whether you take the gameplay at face value or proivde your own deeper reasons to play on the planet - From the Depths just manages to be the right kind of openess and demanding of your input. There's a distinct gravity when the idea of the tutorials are non-intrusive yet ""you're going have a bad time"" noted about the main menu. It's almost like a conterbalance for the thirsty builders and head-canoners who come with ideas on bated breath. In other words, its a game that respects what you want to get into. Its learning curve can come off deceptively harsh, being a storm wind at your front, when after you chime with the game rules, is really the wind in your sunbathed sails. I barely can begin to stress  how emergent the gameplay is and can already become. My play hours are no compare to the scrawls of paper holding designs, logistics, and strategies to reach that meta level of enjoyment, This living toybox is near a 4X game if you are immersed enough. Moveover, Brillant Skies map, naviagation, and tactical screens are great barebones look at the ""real time true strategy"" genre layered in it. And a reminder, at time of typing the game is Early Access and a steal when a sale is going on.From the Depths is a gem tried and true. Every notable build and action has excellent feedback sublte and large. This fact shining the most in the Campaign as the goal  lends a real-time affair to getting resourcing and building right. It's rare in a game a player builds and modifies efficiency -itself- , something any peak performer would droll at when the engines are running. And I think that's a summary right there, an engine you keep feeding and it keep providing. And you the player in turn are the same for the game. This duet is really a hallmark to what makes open sandbox (especially voxel-based) a key game type in this era.Get this game, please - the enlightenment and enjoyment is that one heavy tool the yields just right in hands, and what ever you make feels like dawn break gold. (PS. Seriously, I feel like that Courage Wolf meme so many times with this game. makes you feel experienced with a gruff in your voice, and giant mug in hand, and an aura that you have a story to tell to the young ones )			"

								Imagine Space Engineers with worse graphics, and a far better set of features, set on an Earth-like planet (Neter). You have much more control over everything (from custom-building your engine to building your entire ship around a giant gun if you so choose) but there's also a steeper learning curve due to the wide range of features. If the in-game tutorials aren't enough, just ask on the discussion forums and you'll get a quick answer at most times of day. From the Depths is centered around two things Building vehicles- either to use against other players in a battle, or against the AI in a campaign Battling against players or the AI in a game mode of your choosingIf you don't find it compelling to have the chance to custom build the best combined fleet of ships, submarines, aircraft (whether propellled by jets, balloon, or propellers), and then sending in your fleet to fight as per specific set of commands you and the AI mainframe will give it, this probably isn't the game for you.  I'll explain the campaign, but first I want to talk about what From the Depths has that really sets it apart:-A unique keyboard-based build mode (in addition to the mouse-based mode of building common to games like Space Engineers.) It's impossible to explain in words, but I find it more efficient in most cases. Don't worry, there is a symmetry mode. It'll take you an hour to get used to this, the time investment will pay off in the long-run, the only downside is you'll be wondering why every other game like this doesn't offer the same system. Also, make sure you don't build your ship backwards, the in-game tutorial will explain this, don't skip it. -Four unique offensive weapon systems, all customizable. Also, your AI (if properly set up) can use all of these effectively, don't worry about trying to pinpoint the lasers your guided missiles will follow far into the horizon. I'll try to explain each in-game system briefly (the in-game tutorial will give much more detail): Missiles/torpedoes. Missiles can be short, medium, or long ranged depending on how much fuel you give them, which has the obvious tradeoff of carrying a smaller payload, you can add a lot of maneuverability and speed to intercept small aircraft at short range, or you can go for longer-range missiles that slowly but surely send their payloads in excess of 3-4km. You can actually use missiles to distract missiles- get a small missile system, set it to ""flare"", set a control block to ""fire when hostile missile is within 300m"" and whenever a missile is close enough your little set of flares will fly from your ship or aircraft- works well against infrared seeking missiles, not so much against laser-seeking missiles. CRAM cannons. The name ""CRAM"" stems from the fact that the way the guns work is that you have a series of ""pellet boxes"" and ""ammo boxes"", the more pellet boxes you have the faster you pack your shells with explosive/EMP/kinetic material, the more ammo boxes the faster you load, you'll definitely want to focus on packing over reloading as there's no point in firing a shell with hardly any power packed into it. These are great against large, slow ships and can have a barrel gauge of 2,000mm, really substantial- you might think that it would be immensely overpowered, not so, as with any weapon system there's a big trade off in reload time, and other variables. Advanced cannons/rail guns. Depending on how you design your shell, and the more parts you have to a shell the more room you need to store that shell at any given gauge- the more you can ""do"" with it. I'll give you a concrete example. If I want to fire a shell with 10 gunpowder casings, 2 stabilizing fins which reduce inaccuracy by 80% each (the effect stacks), 3 HE warhead bodies, 3 EMP warhead bodies, 1 proximity depth fuse, and 1 AP capped nose, my shell will release a combined HE/EMP explosion after penetrating a certain depth, the drawback of using this number of parts is that I have to use a lot more storage space for the ammo of a gun of 100mm gauge with a 19 part shell, as opposed to that same 100mm gauge gun firing a shell with only 6 parts. Every thing has a cost and a benefit, so you have to make a compromise with every design. With advanced cannons, you want to focus on accuracy and cooldown so you can fire quickly and accurately, without taking up all the space for gauge increasers which let you fire larger shells, and without taking up all the space for your autoloaders and ammo clips. You can set these up to fire at incoming missiles, if you want to try, use a small gauge and a rapid fire rate. Lasers- I haven't used them myself, but they're designed with several components which, again, have their costs and benefits. These use up energy from the engine, so probably are a bad choice for a small vehicle with a small engine- better go with a cannon or missile system. These are also effective against missilesHonorable mention would be drills and rams, both of which can be used to ram other ships, and some people create some rapidly spinning versions mounted on the front for a large boost to the damage- but I don't really bother. For defensive systems, you can use shields which, at steeper angles, reflect incoming cannon shells, flares as mentioned before can distract incoming missiles, and of course you can stack heavy metal armor for protecting against anything that gets through. Do not forget to put some surge protection from EMP around things like your AI mainframe. Engines are fully customizable- I won't explain it in detail, but the way you design your cylinders/exhaust/carburators/injectors/etc. allows you to compromise between fuel efficiency, performance, and so on. Jet engines also come in a small standard size which takes up 1 block, or a large customizable jet which has parts that are 3 wide x 3 high x 1 long, and you can stack these parts to make an engine as powerful as it is thirsty for fuel.Now, why does any of this matter? Because of the creativity the massive set of tools allows, my overview of what you can do in the game is far from exhaustive. If you want to create a giant, inexplicably airborne floating metal death cube, you can do it, and you've got about half a dozen different ways to make sure it doesn't fall to the ground, or you can make much more realistic design of fighter craft, you can try to design a fleet around a set of workhorse medium cruisers with a few pieces thrown in, or, alternatively, gamble the whole battle on one giant metal ship which has a huge engine, is shielded from all angles, and has several systems designed to fight submarines, aircraft big and small, defeat missiles, and of course destroy large enemy ships threatening you from several kilometers away. IF you really want, you can design your ship around a massive railgun which fires shells at several kilometers per hour, and an engine which can hopefully power it- sort of like an A10, except it floats and is intended to fire through entire ships- also, make sure to use hollowpoint heads on railguns, they impart the entire kinetic force of the shell travelling at 3km/second to the point of impact. Now, again, if you're only interested in seeing these ships blow up, and you don't want to tweak them yourself, you're better off not buying the game and instead just watching a nicely edited video someone else has made where they below up the ships for you.

								Excellent game, just a bit rought around the edges! This game has a huge amount of poetential, it just isn't fully finished. The idea behind the game is great, basically it is an open world vehicle-building game, with an emphasis on physics and battles. The Dev is extremely active in the community, and responds to players' suggestions and new ideas.Give it time, and I think this game will shape up to be truly amazing!			"

								Only problem i've had so far with this game is it using up most of my free time, seriously.First thing most people may think when they see the block system in the game is to think of this as a game like Minecraft. Trust me; calling this Minecraft would be like calling ""Space Engineers"" Minecraft. Honestly Space Engineers would be a far better game for comparison to FTD than Minecraft. Does Minecraft have missiles, space-ships and lasers? Didnt think so.....You can basically build just about anything from Submarines to boats to spaceships in a pretty wide variety of ways, Land structures and vehicles are also gonna be in the game in some time. The engine is very versatile, and the game is  VERY stable for a Pre-Alpha game; seriously ive run into more or less no major issues so far. The campaign mode is aimed to be a very strategic mode where you basically command fleets of vessels (designed by you and made using resources harvested by you!) against the AI factions and there own respective fleets; each faction having unique designs, tactics and difficulty.Now onto the frequent complains that negative reviewers are making about the UI and control system. The Control systems basically designed to give a high amount of fine control over block placement; giving control over all 3 Axis using a combination of WASD keys and the mouse, which helps when your making complicating designs. It also makes it easier to edit componnents that are deep inside the constructs hull; letting you reach and change them easily without having to strip off parts to reach it directly. Despite its versatility and varied usage I really dont think it takes too long to get the hang of the control system; but if you really cant stand it the game also offers a much simpler ""Look and place"" build mode. Building stuff and making it work is a lot easier than people keep saying it is; while at the same timing perfectly optimising something to run via the AI system can be a very interesting challenge for those that wanna have a go at it.tl;dr: Its a lot easier than most people keep saying it is; and if you played Space Engineers (or another similar build-style game) and liked it then youll most likely love this.

								The first time I started this game, I made it about 20 minutes into the hugely comprehensive tutorial course and my brain shut down. It was a matter of weeks until I was brave enough to boot it up again, and a couple of days to finish the tutorials, then I was ready to get building.This game is phenomenal, just persevere through the learning curve and you'll end up feeling like a weapon designer. It's minecraft for war. It's Space Engineers but fun. Designing a new ship/plane/helicopter/submarine is a pure joy, and I lost a few nights just running weapons tests over and over, tweaking parameters in an endless pursuit of explosive perfection. My older designs look like childrens' toys compared to my newest experiments, and there's a vast number of systems and vehicle types that I haven't even touched yet.This game has a huge amount of depth; it's like having a job if your job is to design stuff that blows other stuff up. This is the pinnacle of creative games, and there are few games that have been so chaotically fun.Get it, please.			"

								Such a complex game, so much to learn. The game is a learning process, it could literally take hundreds of hours to learn all there is about building complex ships and vehicles.  The campaign is simple yet challenging, and becuase you will find yourself pitted against some ingineous ships, the game constantly encourages you to  create new and better designs in order to progress in the campaign.  There are some minor bugs but the game is definitely stable enough to play and enjoy.  I highly reccomend this game.			"

								This is honestly, one of the best games ive ever played in my life. you can stylise your ships, make sure they work and feel proud of memorising how to build components, though it requires a lot of patience and it haas a very steep learning curve, which i still havent mastered. i reccomend it to all my freinds, and i am just looking forward to the day this comes out of early acess, but even in early acess i have never had a major problem with the game.A lot of my freinds have quit due to the learning curve, but i think its worth it if you stick to it, its like if Minecraft and an RTS had a baby and it wasnt complete crap and its fanbase was actually intelligent .10/10 would develop naval obsessiona after playing this again.

Very addicting, I mean i when into the vehicle designer and must of been in there for 3 hours creating stuff!-There's no path to beating the game! Do it whatever way you feel!-Basically Minecraft mixed with World of Warships!Cons-Sometimes the AI can be a pain-Takes sometime to get used to.

I had to take them out. I increase my speed and lead them along, hoping to avoid the missiles they are firing. I fire my own missiles and take out the AI on one of them and he falls into the ocean, a hunk of steaming scrap metal. The other one fires missiles at the rear of my aircraft and hits but does little damage due to the heavy armor. I then fire some missiles and take out his wings and weapons. He falls into the ocean and I finish him off, producing a large, fiery explosion from the ammo barrels.10/10It's worth the money.			"

								Ok, this sandbox game, THIS sandbox game, THIS SANDBOX GAME, right here, if you are in to SANDBOX GAMES, this is it for you! The developer is doing an insane job with updates, and he is truly building an outstanding sandbox game *with an awesome mix of campaign/strategy gameplay* that just blew my mind away. I play minecraft, terraria, starbound, space engineers, etc etc, and this one took me from all of them. Absolutely awesome game, great updates on a routine basis, open minded developer, great player community, and a fun and interactive experience to keep you looking forward to playing when you get off work huzzah!!! I highly HIGHLY recommend it, big time kudo's to the dev.*Adding notes* Mk so, reading my review, I realized it doesn't really, give a great review. It's just me being like, super excited because I love the game. So i'm gonna go for a more 'in depth' approach to some things i've come to love and the things i enjoy but, don't love....yet >.> First off, the pro's and cons.Pro's 1 Great building interface, with 2 ways to build, keyboard and mouse. Both of which have their own pros/cons. It also boasts a significant variety of blocks making every creation truly unique in it's own way. 2 Sub assembly system - Ever build something on something else, and wish you could take that something off the something else, and put it on something else? Well, in this, you can. Say you make a kick♥♥♥♥♥turret on one ship hull, but realize the hull just wasn't the right style, and couldn't hang. Well, damn, you don't want to rebuild that turret all over so, you make the hull work, right? Wrong, you can save subassemblies so that when you build more ships later you can add the same things to them w/out having to do all the work to recreate the things that work3 4 area's of combat *although space has been...interesting...follow up on that in the cons >.>* You can fight on land, sea, air, and yes, even space. 4 AI system for your creations to make your own fleet and evolving options to control the actions of your AI drones. I for example have my B-ship i control, with 4 fighters and a destroyer escort that are all AI controlled to escort my Big boat♥♥♥♥♥around. w00t w00t5 Open minded and honest hard working dev team. Now as of now, the only 'dev' i know of, is Mr. Nick Smart. But he has been ON IT. I mean, I participate in alot of early access games. And this is the only one where the dev is constantly in the forums, posting on others and publishing his own, on a frequent basis. He is constant with updates, and is truly doing a phenominal job trying to keep the game in the direction his vision has for it. 6 Campaign system - ok this will be my last pro, as I don't want to bore anyone Ok so, the campaign, has some ups and downs of it's own. Upsides - harvest multiple resource zones, have multiple fleets, multiple battle fronts, simple interface to navigate around your fleets, simple dipolomacy panel to♥♥♥♥♥♥peeps off or make them like you, Pretty good map layout, difficult AI once you get about 1/2 across the map. Overall the campaign, I luv it. I know there are some things in the works so i'm going to list them in the cons section BUT, big disclaimer, they are already on nicks workload and I can't wait to see what he hits us with when he starts evolving them. MK so, Cons. I'll be honest, not alot of huge game crippling things i have found. There are some nuisances but, the dev's actively working on them and, i'm not an impatient guy so, w00t w00t can't wait to see them fixed. Here they are1 MP (creative) is a little buggy. The host is the only one who tends to see all the action going on in the map. For example, if a cannon has a prediction piece on it, and you are the client, you won't be able to see the line drawn to show where your round will go. YOu also can't see the power, speed, drag, so on so forth. Now, do'nt get me wrong, the client can still do everything the host can, but the downside is, he won't SEE everything he's doing. Creative is basically no resource costs, on the campaign map, where you and all connected players can just, build.    MP (AI fight) is a neat concept, but it can be hard finding games up unless you have buddies who have the game to get on at the same time. Basically, you build a ship with an AI interface. You load it against someone elses, and you both watch the ships fight to the death, with no involvement from you. It's great to do to see how your creations stack up against other players. Neat little game mode.2 AI in campaign is, well, garbage >.> As in you can just flot over to a ship, SHOOT the AI mainframe, and walla you have a new ship. Now if you decide to not do that, it can get hard granted if you up the difficulty it does get pretty rough, BUT you have to have a high end machine to handle the big boys, and that means you may be annoyed with the scrub ships your stuck on depending on your gaming monster which takes me into 3 Frame rate can get pretty low when alot of stuff is going on. Another *disclaimer* is that nick is already working on moving to a different game engine, in order to improve this. But as of now, if you aren't sporting a hot rod, and your just cruising with a sedan, you may want to keep your block count a little low to keep from getting to choppy. 4 Getting to space *this might be restricted to just me* Now i have been having the hardest time getting a ship to leave orbit and actually get into space. The only way I have been able to get into space is to, well, build in space. I've been trying to build jets with ion thrusters that could leave the planet go to space and come back in, but i've had no success. Again, this could be a just me moment, but it shouldn't be that hard to leave orbit if you already have the engines to get you to max altitude in the first place. which rolls me into 5 the playable field, while awesome, is also kinda limited. Now it's cool because, you can really chew someone up and they can't get away from you b/c the deepest the water gets is like, 50 meters, and the air goes up as far as 500 meters, and your weapons can easily reach 1000 + meters. So, ya, they can't get away unless they just run, horizontally, str8 away from you. However, if your on the 'oh♥♥♥♥♥♥i gots to go' end of this, ya, it sucks. You have nothing going for you as the height/depth of the playable area is pretty small and therefore you have to just go for speed to run for your life. The last 2 cons, are the only ones on my list that I honestly don't know if the dev is working on, and to be honest, if he didn't change it, i wouldn't be heart broken. B/c yeah, it sucks to not be able to go higher or lower in order to increase my survivability, but it has led me to make more interesting designs with a little more armor to take those hits. And the space thing, meh, i can get over that, i'll just keep building in space. End of discussion Game review - Overall, i've been in 18 Early access games, and so far, this one and space engineers are the only 2 that truly paid off. This one is STILL in early access, but still is truly on point and moving forward at an amazing pace. Again, great dev, great gaming community, evolving game interface and AI systems make it a truly unique experience. Again, if you would like to play a sandbox game, and bring some idea's to the table, or just enjoy the game, this is a great pick. and hey, it'll be going in and out of sale frequently, so get it when it's cheap. I could easily see this game going for 40+ once it's finished. great game. If you happen to get it, by all means send me a message to do some building together, or to blow each other up, i'm always down for both!!			"

								A great game I highly reccomend if you have time and patience. The game is still in alpha so expect some problems like somewhat poor graphics and a lot of lag during big battles. Although the developer is working on these. FTD is essentially a building game, mixed with an rts, and an fps. Because of this the game is immensely complex. The greatest complexity comes from the building process, which will take a lot of time to learn. You will need to learn to build hulls, ai's, cannons, missles, and engines. Each one of these has different rules that detirmine what parts can be connected to what section, and these rules will force you to make decisions about your ships design.  This will be espicially true when you play campaign where resources are limited. You can even use LUA scripting in the game to give your vehicles or missles custom behaviours.Because of the ability to build what you want, the rts like gamepley is pretty interesting. Like modern battles from the depths battles are often detirmined by range and the ability to gain intelligence on enemy movements is crucial to success. The ability to download units from the steam workshop also makes it possible to play the game without needing to design a ton of vehicles. If you've ever wanted to design your own weapons and take them into battle, then ftd is a great game for you. Just realize that this game gives you a ton of design options and a lot of the possible designs suck. This comes from the games balancing that usually forces you to choose between multiple factors especially how big your willing to go.			"

								This game is hard, there is no denying that. The controls are clunky and awkward and DEFINITELY not suited for new players. But I love it.It took well over 20 attempts to get just a decent hull designed that A) floated and B) was stable, so new players please please do not give up when your first boat fails horribly. Slight tips: I found that bigger is usually better for air pumps, (most of my ships are capital sized battleships), and ships really don't have to look nice at the start, (I have a cube, that floats, it's epic).The building controls take a few hours to get used to BUT there is an option to use a more familiar, minecraft style system.This game is very good to teach yourself how to do stuff in it. I watched one tutorial for guns, gave myself a few hours, and could design them to specific characteristics rather quickly.NEVER go straight into the campaign, stick to the designer while you learn, turn waves off (in the settings) and build. It is very easy to zone out and find you built several warships without even thinking.There is something really satisfying about setting your best ship off into an enemy flotilla and watch it destroy every last one.Possibly the best thing I own to take me to nirvana.

								I absolutely adore this game and the sheer freedom of design it gives to the player. You can build practically anything. Realistic warships, flying castles, sea monster submarines, laser-spewing hovercraft, the list goes on for ages.With that said, it's not perfect. The controls are difficult to learn at best, with two options of a mouse-based control scheme that's easy to use but can make building difficult at times, and a keyboard-based scheme that is vastly superior to the mouse-based scheme for building, but much harder to learn and use. The learning curve is very harsh as well, considering just how much stuff there is to build with and how complex building effectively can get.Pros/Cons:Pros:-Allows an unreal degree of design freedom-Great fun once you get the hang of it-The build mode has a lot of useful features like mirroring and the ability to copy and paste subobjects (turrets/rotating parts).-Absurd skill ceiling, you will never stop learning clever tricks or new methods-Updates fairly frequently-Combat is hilariously destructive, in some cases with weapons blasting entire chunks of enemy vehicles off-Vehicles can be fitted with customizable AI that allow the ship to be controlled automaticallyCons:-Battles can cause massive drops in performance if the fight is big enough (huge vehicles/lots of vehicles).-Difficult to get the hang of.-Difficult, period. Enemy vehicles WILL give you trouble when you start out.Overall, it's a very good game and can be a lot of fun once you get the hang of it, but the difficulty and learning curve are pretty intense. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys designing their own vehicles, as this game allows you to do precisely that.			"

								Ah yes, From the Depths, this is an interesting little sand box game that is hard to describe. Remember when you were a kid (or maybe right now?) and you would make spaceships and other stuff out of lego, and then have them fight? Well that is a very basic way to describe this game.Now lets just clear this out of the way, this game has a steep learning curve (some would describe it as a cliff), and the in game tutorials are not the greatest, however, the community, both on youtube and on the forums have some fairly comprehensive guides on the various aspects of the game.As for the gameplay, there are three main parts, you have the vehicle designer which in its basic form is a sandbox where you design and test your own vehicles and can spawn in any of the vehicles already in game. There is a basic ""story mode"", which mostly just acts as a simple tutorial as well as a set of challenge missions. Finally you have the campaigns; in the campaigns you put the vehicles that you have designed to the test in a quasi real time strategy game with resource and army management.In the main campaign you do battle against the various AI factions (8 in total) of the world of ""Neter"", these factions range from the ramshackle wooden designs of the Deep Water Guard, and their eternal foes, the Onyx Watch with their floating castles mixed with Age of Sail Galleons. In the Steel Striders you have more conventional warships that would be familiar to a World War Two buff alongside futuristic destroyers and battleships. For some truly unique designs, there are the ""alien"" Scarlet Dawn, and the tribal Grey Talons with their imposing airships. Of course the most unique in my opinion are the White Flayers, a group of religious fanatics whose ships seemed to have been designed in the wastelands of the Mad Max franchise.There are other worlds as well, including one meant for a World War II Axis vs Allies campaign.As for the vehicles that you can build, they come in a few different flavours; you can create a wide range of naval craft, along with helocopters (very complex to do however), airplanes, low orbit space craft, land vehicles, and if you are so inclined, you can also make stationary buildings.While the game is in Early Access, it is complete enough that you are only really limited by your imagination (and your ability to actually make said imagination work) as well the game recieves frequent updates. Of course, if you purchase the game, you do have to be prepared for updates that may change how the game plays, or messes with your carefully designed vehicles (the much needed engine rework was a good example of this). However, the games developer is pretty good at making it so that any changes are fairly backwards compatible so as to avoid completely breaking designs.So yeah, get out there, make a raft that can barely float, and then before you know it, you will find yourself conquering the world.*Edit* I forgot to mention that the controls in this game are awkward to get used to, standard WASD to move the camera/character, but the vehicle controls use other keys such as UJHK, which would probably make the game awkward for some people, particularly left handed individuals. However, the controls can be rebinded in the launcher, though I have not attempted to do so, as a result I am not sure how well the game responds to this.			"

								This game...oh this game. Where to begin?How about by getting something out of the way first: this is no Minecraft. It isn't download and just ""get"" it straight away, and the included tutorials...well they're tutorials, they get their job done. Point is, there's a learning curve to this game as others have mentioned, both in the construction of parts such as cannons, AI, and engines, then in the actual build process itself.It takes some getting used to when using tools that expedite construction to say the least.But then you get your first boat built and working in the creative mode. Maybe you rig it with the simple weapons. Maybe you make your own weapons. Maybe, just maybe, you start building the largest most fearsome ship possible and just pack that thing full of custom cannons that are essentially full bore autocannons, enough missiles to start and end a war with one of the game's factions, turreted lasers that burn aircraft out of the sky, and a gigantic slash elaborate drill system just to get the point across to your enemies: this is not a boat to be trifled with. Then you make more and more.Perhaps you go into the actual story missions. They have restrictions, parameters, quotas that can't be surpassed. You could just choose to use the resources ie ships given to you to complete them, or you could just make your own machines, using those same restrictions to guide how you cobble them together. Therefore you can complete them your own way, and with plenty of trial and error.Eventually; very quickly if you continue to just smash enemy story mission ships to smithereens; you unlock the campaign mode. Suddenly, all the wonderful ships you built and the machines you used to beat the story missions can become your very own personal fleet with a bit of time, AI, and some patience. Just as suddenly the game ceases to be some sort of ""meet the objectives"" shooter but rather an RTS where your units are those you've built yourself from the twisty maddening reaches of your own imagination. Now you're after efficiency: how can you, the admiral of your fleet, get ships built that are as cheap but effective as possible to mount an assault or defend against enemy fleets? So you continue to build. Upon which you realize that this has ceased to be a sandbox; it is now a ""toybox."" A vehicle simulator, shooter, real-time-strategy, and a huge heaping box of building blocks all mashed together to let you build your own naval and air-force warmachine. And best of all, it gives you most of the building pieces from the get-go. Criminy, if you're still a little iffy on getting From the Depths since it's on Early Access at least follow the confounded game!			"

It's well worth the money you put into it but just know that IT'S SUPER ♥♥♥♥ING COMPLEX. IT PUTS SPACE ENGINEERS TO SHAME. Unlike space engineers, this game has practical controls (so you don't need to push s h i t like INSERT to rotate a block).You will be playing for like at least an hour and a half before you have any basic idea on what to do. THIS ISN'T MINECRAFT, YOU CAN'T JUST PICK UP AND PLAY. However, once you figure out how to build basic stuff.YouSinkHOURSinto this game.once you're happy with what you believe to be a great creation....you are IMMEDIATELY DESTROYED.

								If you like boats, planes, submarines, spaceships, sky fortresses, steampunk, jetbombers shooting lasers and 40 missiles into fleets of giant battleships, then get it. there are many ways to design and kill or confuse enemy ships. Design a kraken squid that latches onto aircraft and draws them into a grinding maw, or a laser platform that shoots beams from space. ballistic missile submarine? sure. hydrofoil rocketboats? yep! swarms of dinky wooden sailboats? you bet! there are many ways to destroy and be destroyed. there are countermeasures for every weapon, there is AI to tune and tweak to get your vehicle to do everything on its own. A great game to play, highly recommended			"

								This games pretty good.Positive things -+ You can build large ♥♥♥♥ off massive boats that fire cannons who's shells diameter is the size of someone who is like 7ft.+ Cannons have a limit, which stops people from making things 'too big' , for example the largest it can get is 200CM or 2000MM.+ It uses wave physics and has gravity act on every piece of the boat.+ You can make steampunk esque flying boats.+ You are able to build a hot air balloon.+ There are simple cannons, but also absurdly complicated ones.+ You need at least a basic knowledge of how physics works.+ You can make railguns that have amazing penetration power, however they eat through energy.+ You can make custom missiles and shells.+ This game is amazing with friends.+ You can make giant lasers. (As in ♥♥♥♥ing huge lasers.... kinda makes you want to scream ""IMA FIREIN MA LAZOR"" when you fire a quad barreled one or something).+ Lasers can set fire to things and melt through metal.+ You can make a plethroa of flying vehicles and seafaring vehicles.+ You can make aircraft carriers.+ You can build drones.Negative Points.- Steep learning curve.- More advanced cannons such as the railguns aren't explained correctly ingame.- Tutorials could do with visual guides as well.- Better UI and Controls as the current ones are slightly confusing.- Better rotating- Mirror mode needs to be better implemented- Physics end of the game needs to be slightly improved, as i made a boat that was perfectly symmetrical but it kept flipping even with a 'keel' i think its called to keep the bottom as the bottom. - Better descriptions on how to build sails along with cannons.- Servers sometimes wont let people join if your in the middle of a session, the host generally has to go back to the lobby.- Lags slightly badly even if you have a ping of like 30-40.- Thus far from what i've seen 'Repair tentacles' don't repair my ships. I don't understand the reasoning for this.Suggestion points~ Could do with flamethrowers or some form of incendiary weapony.~ Specialized weapons for outerspace, such as 'kinetic bombarment tools'~ Napalm warheads for things such as missiles and advanced cannons.//This might not be a fully accurate review due to me now having played a 'tutorial'.

								All was quiet on the southern Front. It had been days since we had seen any signs of the White Flayer scouts. Expecting attack, the Admirality ordered the construction of Anti Air defenses and deployed a small fleet to the area. In the waking hours of the morning, most of the men were either still asleep, with only the early warning radar operators awake. And thank God they were, for there actions that morning saved countless lives. It started with a strange radar signature, about two kilometers off the coast, moving incredibly fast. then two more. Then five. Then ten. It was an entire Flayer airwing, prepared for a swift victory against our motly defenses. The early warning station, against Admirality orders to only send a warning with visual contact, warned the entire coastal area that an attack was imminent. Thats where I come in. I was the lead engineer in charge of defending this area. Seeing that most of our defense towers were still being repaired, I scrapped together as many missile launchers and flak cannons as I could, but I was too late. one after another, the towers burst into flames as they were saturated with missile fire. We lost the battle, but bought enough time to evacuate the servicemen, who would live to fight another day.-Steel Striders engineer, in defense of the Southern Coal Plant.If you can't already tell, I love this game :)			"

								This game is a MUST for anyone with a creative engineering mind. I spent days hating this game. Hating that I couldn't make a hull that would be stable and not sink. Hating that I could not make my weapons work. Hating that the moment I managed to make something work only to watch it get torn to shreds in seconds. But as I learned, I got better. And as I got better, I began to love the game. Now I'm an addict. An actual addict. Don't play this if you like your family... Hahaha! Seriously though, try it. And stick with it.

								While the initial learning curve might be really steep, this game has a surprising amount to offer. The realistic physics make solving problems with your designs interesting and realistic and you can spend dozens of hours trying to make the perfect ship or plane, or whatever you can imagine.

Early Access Review
								Pretty solid in its current state, promising future, dev actually interacts with community and the game was a functional and playable product when released on Early Access, which already makes it more likely to not get abandoned than 99% of games on here.That being said, if you want a more 'secure' project or a game that can be played for merits other than sandbox elements I'd wait a month or even several. There's a big update coming soonish to the 'main' gameplay mode, and a huge list of not-yet-implemented features at the current time.Gameplay wise. It uses a very well fleshed out sandbox building tool to design ships either on the fly or in advance that can be made or spawned into the various game modes. Eventually should feature a rather lengthy campaign that looks like it'll basically be a set of scenarios and goals, simple but entertaining, a Multiplayer campaign mode (""world domination"" style gameplay with resource zones and stuff), and single battles pitting ships against eachother within a resource budget.Pros:-The building tools are amazing, actually including features like fill tools, mirroring both 'along a line' and between two blocks allowing both odd and even number symmetry. Saving and loading sub parts of vehicles (tad odd at this time), and a lot of other ""Blatantly obvious"" things that it's always annoying when sandbox games lack.-The game appears to have a fleshed out backstory and lore that the vehicles of the factions and the story missions are being created to match, and will likely feature a content rich and interesting game world in the end.-The aesthetics. The game's graphical style is quite nice, with wooden structures and vehicles appearing a tiny bit ramshackle but still sturdy, metal stuff solid and sleek in form but covered in weld lines and rivets, the avatars(player controlled characters) interesting and unique. All in all it reminds me of steampunk with a bit of a clunkier appearance that I think fits the general design of the game perfectly.Neutral:-The weapons, while satsifying and powerful, suffer from a bit of 'one best option' problems. For example cannons are best served as being stupidly long guns with obscene fire rates, without much reason to do things like a massive caliber slow firing gun as you could make it rapid fire for purely an additional resource cost. Meaning ""Bigger is always better, faster firing is always better"" with nearly no exceptions.-The physics engine for vehicles is a decent blend of realism and gameplay/CPU intensity concessions. Don't expect an accurate naval warfare simulator or realistic aerodynamics but it's definitely solid.-The combant. Sans current minor AI derpiness the combat is rather well done, with versatile weapon options for your vehicles, ammo and fuel management being things you need to take into account, and lots of information presented in nice visual and auditory manners that don't look out of place. (Shell tracers that indicate shell type, energy shields showing up in world, engines changing pitch by power drain, thrusters for fortresses and jets showing information about themselves by the color of their trails, etc)Cons:-The AI is a little clunky at present, does ok navigating and fighting solo but tends to ram allies repeatedly, make a beeline for stationary structures or sky forts and get caught on those, and the 'orders' system is as of this update not terribly useful or fleshed out, and results in even more of the above. Unfortunately, this is also a key feature of the game, and will almost be required for success in campaign after the coming update, so hopefully it's put in a better state in the next few updates.-Lacking in content, obviously, it's an Early Access game, but the core gameplay ideas are present and largely functional.-Multiplayer is in early testing this version, don't buy it for that, yet.-Current implementation of campaign mode maps is unwieldy and a little derpy in how it handles diplomacy, e.g. allies will 'capture' any territories you leave defended only by structures or empty, but you will still receive resources from your harvesting objects there. Next version this should change but we have limited info on that, so perhaps hold off if that bothers you.			"

								Challenging and very, very addictive. It's hard to believe this thing is still in Alpha. There are a few eccentricties that I hope get ironed out, but it's really hard to tell whether these things are user error or bugs (though I must admit I usually find through trial and error that they're my fault). The only complaint I have is very minor, and that is that certain objects cannot be inverted...this sometimes impacts the performance of my designs or at the very least detracts from their aesthetic appeal. I'm really splitting hairs there though...overall it's truly amazing.Now the learning curve is rather steep, but I've found that looking over some of the many designs available through the workshop as well as the included designs that you can get an idea of how to actually design things yourself. If you're unwilling to put the time in, though, you should just keep on browsing and find something else. It takes some thought, tweaking, and occasional reloading of previous designs (definitely save your builds often, if there's an undo button I haven't found it and find myself occasionally detaching entire portions of builds and can't bring them back) to get something really usable.However, the reward of watching your functional (if ugly, in my case) aircraft streaking across the sky and firing giant heat seeking missiles down onto a ship until the AI detaches the magnetic free fall bomblets all while continuing on to circle back around for another attack run...well...it's totally worth every agonizing hour of design work.Try it out...I mean it's already awesome and this early in development it can only get even better.

								This is one of those rare games that come along that just makes you say wow.  Ive over 1700 games on Steam, even more since Ive been gaming all the way back to the 80's. This is one of those very very rare gems that just literally makes me go wow.  Technically pleasing and advanced enough to make me even want to spend endless hours using it. This will certainly be ONE of those games people talk about for years if not decades to come. When Minecraft came out it was a massive hit, this could very well be that next big thing. Its just way way to fun as it is, and I cant imagine how much more fun it will be when its done. By no means does that mean its not feature fun, it certainly is.  My mind just cant get wrapped around the idea that its still early access and has more content coming in.  Certainly more challenging than minecraft mind you, think minecraft with ubber tekkit and you have an idea whats involved here. Just mind numbing options available to a person to build, let alone fly, sail, drive it into battle and watch it fall apart. Now this is a classic in the making.			"

								This is one of those early access games that will have you coming back over and over again no matter what. Its fun, challenging in its own way, and in most cases, brutal. However thats my opinion.If I were to list the pro's and cons they'd be as follows:Pro's:- Potential for Epic Battles - Ability to build almost anything that maintains the games logic (Which means you can build a lot of stuff)- VERY ACTIVE DEV AND COMMUNITY- Very nice and helpful community- There is a steep learning curve, but that's what makes it fun- Large reserve of resources ingame as well as on Youtube to help learn the gameCon's:- If you dont have the patience or time to learn, the learning curve will seem more like a vertical wall than a curve.- The game is early access and you may want to wait for it to be leave alpha, however the content we have to work with currently is superb- If you can't handle losses, than you'll dislike the campaign as its inevitableEnding Notes: This game is pure awesomeness wrapped into a nice little package. This game is like Minecraft and Robocraft but taken to the next level.Sorry for the essay, but I needed to get my point across. 15/10 would buy again.			"

								When I was younger, I would make ships and boats with lego, cardboard, tin-foil.... well just about anything really, and see if they could float and see how long they would survive the rough seas of the bath. I loved that as a kid, with this game it brings back so many great memories aswell as great fun. You start of with one block and build amazing things from scratch, either a helicopter, plane or maybe a submarine, boat or even a hot air ballon, then drop it into the water and see if it will float, sink, fly or sail. Then add some Ai for Ai controlled guns and Ai controlled movement, then add some some CUSTOM made cannons, lazor's and/or missiles, Then spawn in an enemy ship and test your almighty beast against the scum of the sea, the ""Deep Water Guard"", you may lose the first battle, you may lose the second battle and maybe even the third, but with every defeat you grow stronger, its not how hard you can hit (well thats pretty important too lol), but instead how hard you CAN get hit and get back up and create another ship/plane or whatever it may be and finally destroy that enemy ship! This also has Multiplayer so you and a few friends could build a masterpiece together or just build your own ships and see who wins. This game offers alot of fun and replayability even for an early access game (never thought i'd say that) and this also has a compaign mode, but thats all I will say for now, I will leave you discover the master piece which is from the dephts for yourselfs, and also if you want to watch any videos about this game I would recommend you watch ""Budkai"" on youtube.

								This game is amazing, so customizable, and so many things to do. 200+ hours in and I'm still not even close to discovering the best methods for building things. And there are a lot of things to build. You want a giant battleship that can destroy every enemy that dares face it, you can do it. You want a small destroyer that unleashes hundreds of missiles? You can do that, too. Want a submarine that can launch planes? That's possible too. Want a battleship that flies? That's possible too. Just want to make a man's sausage that fires missiles? Well, you do you. You could also build a floating castle, spaceship, submarine-helicopter hybrid, flying tank, land battleship, fighter jet, bomber, helicopter, hovercraft, submarine-spaceship hybrid, ship with a giant saw on the front that cuts through other ships, kamikaze, ICBM, robotic person that shoots lasers, robotic chicken that shoots lasers, motorcycle, sports car, house, sailboat, galleon, the Black Pearl from Pirates of the Carribean or any other ship from that franchise, a flying galleon, a vertical take off plane, airship, galleon airship, scultpture of whatever person, creature, or thing you want, a paddlewheel steamship, ironclad, or even bumper car.I would say the sky's the limit, but it isn't. You do anything, and I mean anything. The list I made isn't even a full list, there are so many more things to build that I didn't write down, and the developer is STILL implementing now things. Speaking of the developer, he listens to what you have to say. If you go on the forum right now, I garuntee that there is a comment made by one of the developers. They listen, talk to you, give reasons why something is or isn't in the game. If they like an idea, they might even put it in the game. On top of all this, if you build a good quality ship on the workshop that you put a lot of effort in, there is a good chance the developers might put your ship in the game as an enemy faction. How cool would that be?TL;DR Great game, lots of stuff to build, developers listen to you.			"

There is nothing in any other game quite like seeing glimpses of your target being obliterated by a barrage of explosive shells, as you watch from behind the muzzle flash and the clouds of steam and smoke. It's a feeling that only this game can deliver. Stop reading this, buy the game, and shoot giant bullets at things until they explode.			"

								I cant really describe this game as there is nothing like it so here are the pros and consPROS- once youve learnt how to build engines and cannons you can make some pretty awsome creations- plenty of blocks to build with (unlike comparable build systems which only have up to 2x2 slopes ect) so you can get more shaping- the most customisability from any game ive seen (you can change anything shell type, cannon size ect)CONS- The cannon and engine system can be difficult to understand at first as certain things work in certain ways- making stable ships and functional aircraft without them looking ugly is really hard to do - the ""pid controller"" (a little computer to help stability) is painful to set up as lots of un-noobfriendly jargon is usedoverally i would recommend this game if you like building stuff and customization but if your impatient with things and get annoyed when it doesnt work DONT BUY because you will just get frustrated at it and wont relax at all. However with that said if your favorite thing to do is sit down and build something for 2-3 hours then this game is amazing.			"

								Alright, FTD fans! This game is great for it's entertaiment and creativity value! In fact, it taught me my alphabets:A is for Andy, who bought with him a crystal pickaxe, clearly in the wrong game.B is for Beth, who'd bought this game in 2014 and still haven't even started the campaign.C is for Calvin, whose 7x5x3 boat keeps sinking everytime he attached his 20x15x10 CRAM cannon to it.D is for Donny, who for some unfathomable reason places all of his unprotected ammo barrels on the top deck, 'to keep the powder dry' he says.E is for Edward, whose ship keeps capsizing so much that he essentially says 'frak it' and rebuilds the entire hull out of glass.F is for Frank, who fears drowning and shuns submarines like the plague, complaining about there being too much water despite the fact that he's a robot.G is for Gail, who boards an enemy ship and proceeds to tear its insides out with her trusty grenade launcher, only to blow herself up when she stood too close to the ammo barrel she was attacking.H is for Harriet, who shoots the enemy robotic captain and captures a large ship it was piloting after spending hours searching for any mainframes she may've missed, only to get blown up by her own ship's missiles. I is for Ingrid, who wasn't being careful on the deck of her ship during a battle and got taken out by a well-placed shot.J is for Justin, who'd thought that rushing headlong into a paddlegun's field of fire with SMG blazing was both heroic and a good idea.K is for Kenny, who'd died many times trying to close the distance with a bastion using the starter boat just so that he can board and capture it. You b.a.s.t.a.r.d.s!L is for Leon, who fought with the Gray Talons like a lion but died like a cat who'd ran out of lives just because he didn't bring sufficent anti-air/air support.M is for Mark, who'd built his laser assembles all over the ship but forgot to add the transmitters.N is for Nancy, whose newest mystery case involves figuring out why her engines are burning through the fuel so fast...O is for Oscar, who resigns to his trashcan in frustration after taking a refinery explosion too many.P iz fo Peter, who wantz ta clobba fings togetha loike ah roight an proppa Ork but findz out why Ork techyology iz zo killy but unstable...Q is for Queen, whose confidence was immediately demoted to the level of her new name 'Peasant' after realizing that nobody in Neter respected royalty, especially royalty whose ships cannot survive an encounter with their weakest ships...R is for Rommel, who is not as intellectually endowed as his WW2 namesake and who, instead of building up his fleet or defenses like his namesake would, decided to wait for the Deepwater Guard's first ships to come, confident that his pistol will protect him. He'd fought and defeated sea vipers after all, so what's the worst that can happen? Needless to say, his bowel continence and life were not long for this world.S is for Samuel, who unlike his namesake in Life is Strange, actually died when his base got attacked by flying squirrels.T is for Terry, who built a ship that can launch hundreds of missiles but cannot figure out why they keep targetting his own ships.U is for Ursula, who foolishly attacked the Scarlet Dawn's spaceships with simple cannons and dropped bombs.V is for Victory, who then changed his name to 'Defeat' after sending wooden, unprotected planes against the Lightning Hoods.W is for Waldo, who everyone in multiplayer is looking for after making disrespectful trashtalk matched only by an inability to deliver.X is for Xavier, whose struggles in vain to read the minds of the ships coming at him like his X-Men namesake and who couldn't get away fast enough in his wheelchair to avoid the salvo when they got within range.Y is for Yale, who will have too many students not studying because they still trying to learn how to build ships and stuff.Z is for Zod, who built a huge, lag-producing fleet of spaceships with the intent of conquering Neter for the glory of Krypton but somehow forgot to add the weapon controllers to any of the ships.ABC's are fun! - 26 letters/10			"

								""Science tells us that rage quitting can be reduced to acceptable levels by learning how to play.""I'll admit, I got this game a little bit after my friends did and was confused to all hell, having no idea what I was doing. It took a couple hours of tutorials and youtube videos to understand enough to build my first functional ship. Now I'm building weapons of mass destruction, lasers that can give you a proctology exam from space, a missle that I write your name on and it follows you home, ships that switch between submarines and spaceships (granted the first time I did that was unintentional)If you're not wanting to spend the time to learn how to play From The Depths, then you may want to go play a simpler engineering game.

Throw them together with a campaign and story line missions, then add a large dose of cool and youre getting somewhere close to this game.It has a steep learning curve, but there are plenty of videos and tutorials available to get you started. You can get your first small boat up and running pretty quickly but it will take some time and experimentation before you can make some of the crazy stuff you see on the videos and You Tube vids.The Dev is active, responsive and listening to the community, with updates coming thick and fast.Definately give this game a go... but please give it more than 10 minutes before making your mind up (like your standard steam reviewer).

However, due to many things being extremely complex, it will likely confuse new players immensely, and it can lag out lower-end PCs in larger battles.			"

								If you enjoy building games like me, this game is gem in the rough.  It has similar vehicle design to Empyrion, but much more detailed.  Of all the building games I've tried (7 Days, ARK, Subnautica, Eden Star, Empyrion, Intersteller Rift, Space Engineers, Miscreated, WURM, etc ,etc.) the combat in this game is by far the best.  Submarines, surface ships, aircraft, spaceships, land vehicles and forts can all participate in the same battle.Pros:- Sky's the limit in design possibilities.- Lots of combat.- Repair bots function automatically.  No need to repair/replace damaged blocks by hand.- Thousands of designs on the Steam Workshop.Cons:- Some counter-intuitive physics at times.  (For example, ships use bouyancy rather than displacement)- Incredibly steep learning curve.- Maximum of 50,000 blocks per battle.- The UI is difficult to navigate and controls are somewhat clunky.

								Im going to start off by giving some advice to anyone thinking of picking this game up. First off, the learning curve is a slap in the face, if you start trying to play campaign/etc without looking up tutorials or guides you will not have a clue what your doing. The second is that this game is an early access game, its not finished yet and can be buggy, I personally have had instances where the game crashes mid battle or at the end of one. This hasn't occured very often but is annoying when it does. I therfore recommend saving before and after every battle just in case it does crash.After getting over the negatives of bugs/crashes and the insane learning curve i have to say that this game is absolutely amazing (when you know what your doing :P) The conctruction is really good, basically if you think of something in this game you can build it. Replicas of ww2 warships? yep, large bombers? yep, A death star orbiting the planet? yep. The battles are awsome, they allow you to slow down time, zoom over to your enemies and see the chunks being blown out of them by your ships weapons. In all this game is really really good but is a challenge to learn and can be buggy at times. If your willing to push through that then by all means pick this beauty up!			"

								Finally, Minecraft and pirate battles meet!If you have ever played games like Pixel Piracy and Guns of Icarus Online, you will probably agree that destroying ships while keeping your one operational, can be intense but also a heck of a lot of fun! I have always wondered if there was a title out there that gave you the freedom of creating a vessel that you could then use to challenge other ships.While there are some pirate battle simulators out there (Air Buccaneers and Guns of Icarus Online to name but a few), none of them allow you to fully customise your vessel through the process of building it from individual blocks (I suppose Pixel Piracy offers this, but it is 2D sadly and therefore limits your creativity substantially)!Even at early access level, I can see that this game has a lot to offer! I am excited to see what future updates bring. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sandbox-build-and-destroy-simulator type games.			"

								Written as of Release 1.947, 19 April, 2016.        This game is one I've been addicted to for months now. I may not have the hours to show it, as I play a fair amount offline, but the experience is definitely here. I'll have a quick summary. Would I recommend From The Depths to someone who is willing to learn and values gaining experience through trial and error? Yes. Would I recommend it to someone who just wants a simple game that's easy to get into and you can easily become a powerful god in? Absolutely not.        Well, why would I recommend this to the first type of people? Well, it's a hard game. I'm not going to lie. This game will slam your face in the ground many times. But the ones who learn from things like that will thrive off of what they learned from that. They'll get back up, dust themselves off, and fix the problem before heading back in. A fair amount of knowledge is useful in From The Depths. Simple physics, some mathematics, advanced problem solving, etc. But even people who don't know those can easily excel with the will to learn from mistakes. Your ship keeps flipping over? Well, time to make sure the center of mass sits lower in the vehicle. Basic problem solving can soothe the rage I see in others.        But what about the second group, Dim? As I said, it's a hard game. Not everything will just pop right up to you. I first started playing this before the new tutorial additions, and let me tell you, it was hard. 90% of what I know came from reverse engineering, experimentation, and watching others. But now there's a much better tutorial system that even helped me with some things. I can say if you instantly want to be a god at building things, this will never be the game for you. No amount of tutorials will ever make it so. You have to be able to not get frustrated at every little thing and be able to problem solve. It takes time.        Now some people complain about the ""horrible"" UI. Well, yes, it's extremely simple and definitely not pretty. But it gets the job done. There are a few things that I'd say are difficult to figure out, but once you get it, it's second nature. I will admittedly say the multiplayer is lackluster. It's originally what I got the game for, to play with friends. But now they're working on it. It's an Early Access game after all. There will be issues. There are quite a few other little issues, but everything is subject to change since I first typed this. No game is perfect. I will say the learning curve was rough, but the game must have some addictive drug in it after you get the hang of what to do.Pros:Amazing building capabilitiesSmart AI systems (usually)Infinite combinations of gun systemsHighly reactive physicsSuperb combat effects (shell impacts, pieces flying off, etc.)Amazingly rewarding for the ones who persistGreat graphics (for a Voxel game)Cons:Harsh learning curvePoor optimizationPoor multiplayerSmall glitches (shouldn't be much of a problem, however)Overall:8/10. Amazing game in my opinion, but it has flaws. Worth the buy for those willing to invest some time into it.			"

								*ahem**read imaging Morgan Freeman as the narator for full experience*Long ago, a young walrus laid in his bed watching Netflix late at night. He had loved customization in video games, so much so nothing quite solved his hunger for customization; not Grand Theft Auto Five, and even not DC: Universe Online. This creative young walrus envisioned a sandbox-survival where you could do more than slap 200 pre-build engines and cannons on a vehicle to make it good; a game where he could customize every aspect of everything in the whole fuzzing universe. Long since then, that poor little walrus gave up on that dream, realizing nobody would ever go the extra mile for such a game. But Brilliant Skies Ltd. proved little Willie walrus very wrong. They went the extra GIGAPARSEC (for those who  are NOT the largest nerd in ze world, zat is the largest unit of measurement, a.k.a. 3.6 billion light years). Little Wilhelm was ecstatic at this marvelous game. As fast as a tubby little walrus could run, he grabbed 20 bucks out of his wallet and sacrificed it for this marvel. But it was too good to be true right? NAY, NAY I DO SAY. Little Willie walrus discovered he didn't even know where to start when trying to POWER his vehicle with an engine. Willie could not even make a ship that drove correctly; he had to make a katamaran (3-platformed boat). But with the power of his friend YouTube, Wilhelm Walrus make a boat (given, it is not very good a fighting), and soon enough he joined the campaign to stick it to the Deepwater Guard (he still actually hasn't, but he is trying (:3=)).*nerdy white kid lispy voice*Now that I have told the story of little Willie Walrus, he shall list the pros and consPROS-This game has already improved its graphics form the older videos on the steam page.-Brilliant Skies has managed to find balance between content and bug-fixing updates, like ye old Space Engineers.-It never gets old, there is simply too much to do, too much to make, *deep-voiced black guy*too much love.-3 types of weapons is actually enough to play hundreds of hours, 3; that shows the complexity of this game.-You can make any type of vehicles, form fortesses, to mountainside artillery, to cars (i think, haven't expirimented), boats obviously, balloon-craft, helicopters, helicarriers, aircraft carriers, jets, propeller planes, space or air satellites, and maybe spacecraft, I haven't seen it one but I'm confident someone will.-Controls are intuitive once you learn them, but you better spend some time with 'em TO learn them.-There are 19 parts for missles. You can make any type of missle, even torpedoes or, uh, harpoon missiles...-Everything is balanced.-No bugs that ruin any experience.CONS-It can be a bit annoying just staring at your resources going up when you're saving up to spawn in your pimping new battlecruiser in campaign.-Campaign mode is a bit simple (at the moment at least)-LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG. And I have a ASUS G750 Republic of Gamers. So if you run your games in POTATO OS v. 6.7, I reccomend staying away till further notice.-I have been failed far too many times by early access (looking at you Starforge and Stranded Deep, and, well Stomping Land), however this looks very promising.-If you're a bit more casual, then look at that street sign over there, <Steep Learning Curve Ahead>All-in-all, 13.536 out of 5 stars. It is my new favorite Steam game. It beat Payday fudging 2. A must for people who like games they have to research, and btw a great place to learn is Lathrix's channel on Youtube, it helped a lot.*UPDATE* They have now added a 4th type of weapon, of course not counting simple weapons. They are complex cannons, and they are far more customizable with different mantlets and best of all custimizable projectiles (:3=)! They have also improved the texture for wood further, and it now looks like it could actually be used in more than a flimsy wee raft.*NOTE* As I said in my cons list, this game be not for the casuals. It is very hard, it can take hours to design a simple corvette, or a little raft with a gun. Some of the UI doesn't make this much better, just with the way it is presented seemingly randomly.			"

								TL;DR: You need to make a large time commitment and motivation to get anything done, but please read the entire review.Before you read this, this is a negative review because of the fact that while I would love this game, it has flaws that make it impractical for me.When first opening, there are no problems. The main GUI is simple to understand and easy to navigate, although grammatical errors appear every now and then. The main issues are with the steep learning curve and the fact that the tutorials don't really give you an idea of how to make a ship/airplane that fulfills all of the ""requirements"" that most set; It must be good looking, dangerous to the enemy, resource, fuel, and energy efficient, and have a practical purpose. It gives the building blocks, but lacks an explanation on how to put them together. I do understand, however, that games that ""hold your hand"" can quickly become annoying, but some early instruction would be nice.The learning curve is quite steep; it took me 10-15 hours to get a moderate grasp of most of the components and how they work. It can get frustrating when the tutorial doesn't explain the concept well enough for you to understand (the airplane ones were like this for me).Once past most of the tutorials, I hopped into designer, and, seeing people like Robbaz, Lathland, and Redstonize, I set about making a ship to beat them all! Then failed. One of the biggest challenges faced by the newcomers is the fact that you have to build your own ships from scratch, without any guides on the simple things like how to shape you hull and the best layout to organize things like ammo, engines, and mainframes, or a general idea of how much you'll need. IMPORTANT PART STARTINGThe time commitment is huge for From the Depths. It will take a considerable amount of time to build any decently performing ship. Battles can take a while, restocking and moving fleets takes time to learn and perform. All of your desings need prior thought to build; it is not a ""sit-down-during-lunch-and-play-for-5-minutes-game."" It will be easy (and almost required) to play for hours at a time, and for younger kids with ""technology time"" restrictions, it will be challenging. You will need to plan and plan and plan to make sure everything fits together nicely. Finallly, time for the gameplay. It is well put together, clean, pretty easy to understand, and gets harder as you progress. The killer: time. Yes, my biggest and (almost) only problem is time. If you have the time to spend, go for it. For the casual gamer, balancing a job, school, or time restraints placed by parents or schedules, this is problably no for you. If you have the motivation, then go for it, as the sucesses outweigh the troubles in the long run.IMPORTANT PART ENDED			"

								I genuinely dislike minecraft due to my lack of creativity, and other too such as space engineer. At first, this look interesting as have a wide variety of location to build your project like plane,spaceship and ships. I didn’t expect much considering this look like every other building game and in early access. The game does take a while to get into, my ship keep flipping, and plane nose dive when take off. I still can’t make a proper plane but the suprising thing of this is I actually enjoy what I fail instead of sobbing in a corner :D The community is also very friendly, they will usually try and say constructive thing but you would get much better help with their forum on their website.The building aspect is relatively easy, I can either use the usually flying and use mouse to build or using your WASD to move your block piece which is extremely conveniences as I don’t need to fly around and aim at that specific spot. It does not have undo which can give you a major headache from time to time.Despite the stereotype of Early Access, the developer on this update every few weeks and most update are major. There are also other small and important feature that are not in such as the ability for turret to not go back to it original position and key binding on the entire keyboard.The multiplayer aspect is pretty much nonexistence if you do not have a friend to play with since majority of room are password protected.

The game is currently in open-alpha and already contains a wide range of single player content and as soon as you're familiar with the build mechanics the game opens up into a fun and rewarding experience. - Superb!

								It's kinda like Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program had a baby which had all the ingrediants to fail horribly and fall into the pit of clone games that are all essentially ""Minecraft with a slight twist"", however the baby turned out to be the Mozart of block building games, even in alpha stages it is incredibly fun and rediculously engaging. During the campaign you can feel how innefective a one man army is so your first priority is to automate your ships, planes and fortresses and once that's done this game transforms from a complex block builder, to a full blown Real Time Strategy. It has no real constrictions to the way you play, you can build monstrous battleships that are almost unsinkable, hitting harder than a Sunday morning hangover, or squadrons of ultra nimble fighters that can outpace missiles and bullets with ease, though personally I go for edge of space motherships that rain down molten pain from a distance. The ability to craft a cannon piece by piece is something I've never encountered before, taking into account what kind of weapon would be appropriate for the craft you can fully customise the weapons capabilities from the range, to the accuracy, firerate, caliber and ammunition type, or opt for a laser or missile system with just as many options.Another wonderful thing about this game is the developer's 100% commitment, I've seen on the forums more than once, someone having an issue getting something to work correctly or encountering a bug of sorts and the developer promptly replying, first to appologise, then to explain how to make something work or to say that he will fix this in the next update, which he seems to always follow through with. The developer's liveliness in the community is reason enough to buy this game as he listens to suggestions and responds almost always saying that he will add this as a feature, or that it may damage the balance and it may possibly come as a feature in the future. With this in consideration it honestly feels like a game ""by the people, for the people"".10/10 would play forever			"

								-Core flaw (of personal opinion): Very tiring and steep learning curve with the build interface, I would say thats its biggest flaw. Example: theres an 'align block with camera' button, but not a rotate button? Or if they do its very hidden, so again, deep (lol) learning curve. You can always find guides on youtube for ship building / button layout, etc. But for example: I purchased this game some time in 2015 and had a blast with it, trying to relearn the controls again after remembering the several sessions I spent trying to memorize things so it didn't take me an eternity to build the simplist of things really sort of just 'turned me off' again from playing, my feelings on its flaws aside and how they discouraged me from re-learning at the present moment aside!------------------------------------------It's a very 'deep' voxel based game, not quite as hands on as minecraft, you dont collect your resources by hand. The process is some thing of harvesting resources from visable fields in the ocean / using the remains of your enemies. The game does offer missions, multiplayer, a few different campaigns. If you lack ideas you can grab almost anything conceaved on the workshop, no one seems to be shy about sharing their vessels, terrible or not some times. The campaigns sort of turn into an RTS of sorts pretty quickly, as you manage AI fleets and build / repair / arm said vessels with autorepair parts once you can afford them / build repair AI vehicles / Add guns, missiles, torpedoes, etc. -Build anything from 'Space Ships' (I'm not sure if you could call it space, look into that if its a selling point to you*) to old timey galleys to submarines to helicopters to zeplin airships, Aircraft carriers, aircraft carrier subs, sub carrier subs, space ship carrier subs?- the sky is sort of the limit along with your imagination (hence the title) and it can seem a bit primitive, users have come up with some very creative content and shared in the workshop to help 'put wind in your sails' for creative ideas of your own.-Battles can become very exciting, and you can witness your dreams get ripped to shreds, luckily you can save blueprints of your works in progress pretty much any time you like before hand so yeah, you'll learn to save often. I would say having your creation fight other AI craft and win or lose can be quite satisfying and challanging especially at first. Combat can be done manually (manual turret aim, etc) or have AI do 50% - 100% (shoot, or shoot & drive) depending on how you've designed your ships, again because its a voxel game using odd blocks to represent ideas of ship componenets, there is a learning curve even on how AI works on a boat, unless its been changed you must add certain AI controller blocks to work with other AI blocks, its not quite as complicated as it sounds but does take a bit of reading and guide sloothing. That being said, because of its complexity with parts it will allow users to create very cool and unusual concept vehicles. -Bugs and crashing, it's at a minimal if any, and if memory serves me correct earlier versions were relitively bug and crash free, though again if I remember correctly from the peroid I played when I purchased, it did not include multiplayer of any sort less sharing vessels, so I cannot speak for the potential bugginess of the MP aspects of the game.DO I recommend this for you?:--------------------------------If you enjoy playing creator mode more so in minecraft for the end results of aesthetics or loved tekkit because of the layers of complexity from new blocks it added and how they worked together, and you can learn a 'new way of building' with some keys that almost seem to have purpose behind their strangeness after you remember/figure out why, then yes I do recommend this title to you, especially if you're a fan of naval combat. on the other hand if you're looking for some thing quick where the user simply plays the game more so then building ships in the ship / vehicle creator then you may not quite enjoy this title like I and others have, though like I've mentioned its vast armada of user created content avialable in the workshop allows you to download and plug into your campaign any vehicle of any purpose, refinary, rig, or what ever you might need at almost any time, but be weary you can't build GaryColeman68's USS Enterprise (with A-4, F-14, & AH-64) if you just start your campaign and have limited resources! So keep all that in mind, though at any time you could take said Enterprise into a combat simulator against JakeLongArm82's Space Drednaught (with submersive and sub-bay abilities) and see who's fleet 'keeps afloat', Both those examples of users content are totally made up, though lots of that stuff does exist.-------------Short & Sweet: It's a creative man's fleet builder and psuedo RTS, in no way is it a quick way to burn some time for fun though.

								This game is so intensely fun, I can't believe it's not well known. It's definitely a gem in the rough of steam games. In my opinion, the very best, most addicting games out there are the ones that offer a wide expanse of creativity through building and customization. From the Depths is just that. I'm sure many people put most of their time into the campaign-like modes, but my favorite part of the game is the editor. You can create any ship, plane, flying-fortress, submarine - ANYTHING! You can pit your own creation against hundreds of developer-made creations, slowly perfecting each part of your vessel. There is a steep learning curve, but it is manageable with some patience, especially with the infinite possibilities that this game offers.			"

								This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. It does have a steep learning curve for most people. I mean it took me about 200 hours in game to finally figure out how to build a decent water-based ship. That doesn't even include the nuances to building other types of vehicles and craft. Overall though, the game is much worth it after the initial grind to learn the game mechanics. The community is extremely helpful on its forums to help answer any questions you may have. If you are looking for a voxel-sandbox based combat game, then you should look no further.			"

								You'll notice that the vast majority of reviews are made by people with well over 100 hours.This is because of the games ridiculously steep learning curve; it takes at least 10 hours to get the jist of what you are doing...However, once you know what you are doing the creative part of you that had died from the tedious construction of minecraft, suddernly can be let loose to construct anything you can think of.9/10, the steep learning curve and the games ability to suck away time are the downsides.

								This game is like battleship lego. You have pieces from engines to missiles to cannons all of which you make yourself. Also, much like lego, you can take the bits and bobs and make them into whatever you like, airships, submarines, and tanks are all possible, and looking throught the workshop gives an idea of the amount of creativity that can be put into this game.The campaign is fun. The story isn't explained outside of a liitle blurb, but I'm not too far in. However the enemies are diverse and challenging enough. However I recommend building your own ships, not using prebuilt ones, as thats what makes fighting fun in my opinion.The main weaknesses are that the complexity gives it a huge initial learning curve, and I found the ""documentation"" tutorials pretty weak, which didn't help. That being said, if you want a fun, creative, and mechanically deep game, this is the way to go.			"

								Great game.  In a way,  its a conglomerate of other physics/building games rolled into one.  Ships, Submarines, airplanes, jets, helicopters, airships, and even spacecraft,  if you can think it up,  it can be built here.  And this is far more detailed in terms of graphics and physics than those blocky/minecrafty games people compare this to.  FTD is more like Space Engineers on the ocean...But it isn't just a throw something together in 5 minutes and go battle like most others,  you'll spend countless hours designing ships, perfecting them, testing them, retrofitting them as you play through campaigns. Therefore,  it does have a somewhat steep learning curve.  Most of these bad reviews are from people who haven't played long enough to give a proper review,  or simply just don't have the patience for this game.			"

Ships, planes, spacecraft for sure but also the engines, weapons and AI can all be designed to fit any requirement.It takes a bit of time to learn but it's not overly complicated and it's a lot of fun.A real gem imo.Pros- Excellent (the best?) designer / builder.- Has depth but not overly complicated.- Build everything - not just vessels but also weapons, engines and AI.Cons- Hurts social human relataions - builder so addictive i played almost 50 hours in just over a week.- Non trivial learning curve (totally worth it though).- UI could be better organizedBottom line: totally worth every cent - even in alpha stage.

								From the Depths is a game that allows you to really go with the immagination and actually build anything you want. So it is Minecraft you say. No, it is not, it is a game that instead of letting you build a static ship, or structure to admire let's you build a perfectly functional ship with cannons, missiles, lasers, torpedoes, AntiAir artillery, Laser missiles defence systems and tons of other weapons and defence systems. It is a game where you can truly go nuts with the building and create working replica on 1:1 scale of your favourite ships/planes/submarines/everything you imagine ( you can build also sky fortresses, buildings, underwaterbases). I really can do nothing more than tell you to buy this game as even if in development it is one of the game with more content i've ever seen, actually i've got soemthing like 650 hours in this game and i'm nowhere near tired of it. Just watch the constructions on the workshop to undestand the magnitude of the creation you can do, and as a conseguence the magnitude of the battles you can do betwen those creations !!			"

								I've played for a little over ten hours now, and it's still faily confusing. I can build small vessels, make custom (Somewhat working) cannons and gun batterys, but large ships, planes, spaceships, or heck, engines? Not a chance. If you don't mind a confusing start (Or i'm overlooking something) this game is great. Taking part in a massive fleet battle, with aircraft carrying out bombing runs on enemy ships, or defending your flagship from airborne threat. Submarines sneaking in to sink enemy command vessels, cruisers firing missiles at the enemy, small attack boats dodging in and out launching torpedos, high altitude bombers obliterating enem coastal gun positions. You take a look around as a ship slowly capsizes and begins to sink, or another plows into a smaller enemy ship, snapping it in half, and you can't help but be impressed. At it's best this  game is just incredible, plain and simple. The basic buidling is essentially easy, but getting the balance right, and the finer points, like weapons, propulsion, and control (Rigging the thing up to an AI system) is complicated at best. This is well worth the twenty dollars, even for an early access game. I have yet to find something that even comes close to this. If you don't really want to part with that much money for it though, pick it up on sale. This truely is a great game. The graphics are fairly decent, the underwater scene could use some help, it's very barren, but the gameplay compensates for this. Who has time for scenerey when your jet powered submarine plane is racing along at high speed.  Bear in mind this game is EARLY ACCESS! As a result you will find bugs, problems, and other manner of in development game problems. But this game is coming along nicely, and I rarely encounter a bug. If you've got the money, and are a fan of naval combat pick up a copy (And one for a friend while you're at it.)			"

								Edit, Day of Posting: I actually wrote this review about a week after the update that removed resources. Steam was glitching out at that point tho, and did not allow me to post the review at that time.From the Depths is an in-depth Naval Design/Constuction/RTS/FPS/Ship Capitan game. The game has 3 gamemodes as of current: the Campaigns consists of building physics-reactive ships/planes/tanks/structures in which to combat other ships/planes/tanks/structures for resources in an RTS manner. Adventure Mode has you build a ship under pressue of encroaching enemies, and forgoes most of the RTS elements for a more centralized capitaning of your craft. And in Creative you can play around with unlimited resources to create whatever you desire, the sky is not the limit. For those concerned about the difficulty curve, while it is extremely steep, once you get about 3/4's up it becomes seccond nature, and a very enjoyable.And overall, I would recommend this game in every respect, if it were not for the most recent update (v1.9587 as of writing).Before the update, there were 5 resources: Natural (For wood and so on), Metal, Scrap, Oil, and Crystal (Catch all for exotic materials: nuclear power, computer components, etc). A 6'th if you count Energy/Power from engines and RTGs.In the most recent update, this was reduced to 2 (""it makes the game far more streamlined, balanced and understandable."" - The Dev), and that is Materials (Power is unchanged from before the update).I am going to give my oppinion from here on in this review: I am not in support for this change. I feel this removes a large chunck of the depth from the game, just slap a bunch of gatherers and storage on a ship and you will get everything you need without need to know what resources you needed. (This specific example is much less relevant than I make it out to be, I just wanted to got it off my chest. Edit: I have described a similar version of this issue in an edit at the botom of the review.)I am going to give 2 examples on how this is a bad decision, one an in-game example, the other an analogy to other games.EX1: Say you fight a very strong force of DWG ships, DWG builds with primarily wood. You capture a few of these ships and scrap them, now you can make a decently sized metal ship that can tear through other forces 3-5 times its represented power level. How is this balanced? Or realistic at all? Unless I have some sort of fusion mass converter (Lore-wise I do not know if these objects exist), I cannot turn a bunch of pine logs into a full fledge AI system and a pulse-laser to match, all on a steel hull.EX2: Say I take Path of Exile, a game with no universal currency (Gold coins, ect) but I must buy things with tiered items in a barter system. Say I remove the whole tiered-item currency system and replace it with basic gold coins for the sake of ""Streamlining"". If you play PoE, this would infuriate you to no end, you would probably quit! (I would)Well guess how I feel.Albeit I haven't played the game in a little while, I still liked the concept and execution, and wished to support the project. I cannot do that now as I fundamentally dissagree with where the dev is taking this game, and under these curcumstances cannot recomend anyone spend money on this game. That does not dictate what YOU do tho. If you can tolerate, or even like, the new resource system go right ahead and buy the game.TL;DR: Game is good, the dev oversimplied resource mechanics for the sake of ""Streamlining and Balance.""Edit: @spudcosmicI already have my examples and reasons why I dislike it. It does not have ""zero impact on the game"". I guess another way to put it, is that it removes a major game-time based balance mechanic. With the extra resources, you had to make ships of similar power to that of your enemy, because you had similar resource amounts and types compared to them. They removed that, and in turn it removed that barrier, allowing the construction of overpowered ships before even wiping out the DWG. I also feel that it forced players to expand more than the new system. Unless you are going to live off of the single all-infinite-resourcezone, you have to find other resouce zones, many of which have varied amounts of specific resources. You could find a place that had a great deal of metal or natural, but nothing else. Now it's just pure quantity, no need to find zones that have the specific resource you need. To an extent, it also defeats the purpose of the centralized resource system, making it to where there are no specific resources that you would need to haul across the map.			"

								A block building game that feels nothing like Minecraft or any of its clones. You build ships, planes, submarines, or whatever else you can imagine, arm them like they are a SWAT team of Jayne Cobbs and let them free. If you want to go truly crazy you could make enough explosions that even Michael Bay would say it was a bit excessive. Would recommend to anyone who played with legos and always ended up building battlecruisers and dreadnaughts. Only feels like a (pre)alpha in the multiplayer, which is still very buggy, but its new and being improved.			"

								There is something oddly compelling about this game....Despite the fact that I have died time and time again in the Adventure mode, and despite the fact that the game has an extremely steep learning curve (though, if you have played Minecraft Mods like Buildcraft, it's not really as bad as it appears on the surface), this is a surprisingly engaging game, possibly because of the promise of what you CAN do if you persevere.Like Dwarf Fortress, losing is 'fun', and each iteration takes you slightly nearer to survival as you learn your way through the components you are using, your knowledge of how to assemble and use the equipment available is the key to your survival.Looks-wise the game is reminiscent of games like Minecraft or Starmade, the GUI is basic, and can be fiddly at times, it works ok, but probably needs (and will probably get) a polish in the future.There ARE glitches, the AI can have the occasional strange mood, and I can understand how the level of complexity can be offputting, engines are easy, but some of the weapon stuff is pretty complex, I've yet to manage a working anti-missile laser, but I'll get there. If you're the sort of person who doesn't mind losing frequently, and who doesn't mind having a wiki open in their browser whilst playing, this is a fun, challenging game with a massive amount of scope. Even the tutorials try to kill you and you know what? That's oddly refreshing.			"

								it's really good in a very kerbal kinda way!for starters i will say i dont think this game will ever be done, which will♥♥♥♥♥♥some people off but ya gotta understand what its going for. this game is basicly a sandbox wherein you build vehicls and mash them against other vehicles to see which one would win in  a fight. there really is no ""complete"" version of this game since it doesnt really have an end goalthe graphics are really sub par as well as about every singe art asset in the game from menus to blocks to textures so in that sense dont expect much but what it lacks in visual beauty it makes up for in sheer mechanical depth. the player can design not only the hulls of the ships but also every missile to bullet thats fired and even the weaponry themselves, adding extra barrels or autoloaders to custom cannons and extra missile/torpedos that are uinque to your ships.the player can also design custom AI scripts for combat and movement or specialised rotation blocks to build at odd angles, you can build gunships with AI designed to hover and circle around the enemy, you can build kamakaze vehicles to ram head first and decimate a target, you can build aircraft carriors with sub-vehicles like planes that take off from the runway, you can build working tanks, airships, spaceships and jets. the possibilities are endless!if you want to spend 30 hours not knowing what your doing but having as much fun as a kid with their legos, buy it. If your looking for a standerd minecraft style survival expiriance or a far cry esqe open world adventure then you might wanna try annother game ;3			"

								Do not be scared by the early access tag, the game is already easily  worth the price tag, and the developer is very active. This is an gem of a game. The building is fluid, and the amount of creations you can make are endless. Be it a barn, battleship, or a battle-balloon you can build it in this game.Construction is fluid (sim planes, tool bars, ect all ease building tremendously)Customization is endless, your not just designing the chassis or the guns here. Everything from the cannon barrels, to the hull, to the props is of your creation. There's even an editor if you tire of the stock campaign.The campaign is a unique feature all on its own. The ships you build in designer can be spawned in campaign for use there, where the game plays somewhat like an RTS.If your looking at buying this game, just take a moment to view the workshop. Alternativly you can join the TS3 channel IP: 85.236.105.19:11407 Password thisisgonnabeawesomeDISCLAIMER: While this is a voxel game, the learning curve is very steep. Although new tutorial are being made, I would STRONGLY suggest taking a look at the forums here: http://www.fromthedepthsgame.com/forum/index.php "

								I've watched hours of videos on how to play this game before I bought it so don't let the hours I have in it at the moment deceive you. So far this is the best game I've played in years, Honestly my entire life I've looked for a game with such an easily customizable AI system that's still super in-depth as this one.Don't get me wrong, however. This game is NOT easy. The controls aren't easy, the mechanics aren't easy, and even the battles aren't easy. This game is more than just a challenge for your reaction skills though. This game is a challenge for your brain. Coming up with new and innovative ways to use the mechanics to make amazing creations for either looks or potency is what is, has, and will always be what separates this game from the others. This game is Minecraft on steroids. If you enjoy being able to build legos with computers that you can program to do pretty much whatever you want, then this game is for you. I would highly recommend even though there is one glaring issue I will address down below.I'll cut the developer some slack and let any bugs slide for now since it is after all an alpha. The one thing I do have slight issue with however is the framerate. My pc is more than capable of running most games and in smaller engagements I lose slim to no fps. However in the larger battles and even the benchmark it goes and stays around 10-12 fps on the lowest settings. I sincerely hope the dev will have some sort of breakthrough in the code to get more performance out of the larger battles because that's the only thorn in the side of this game right now.Other than that, I would recommend this to only the more intelligent of my friends. Not to insult anyone's intelligence but unless you're smarter than the average gamer, this game will get on your nerves quickly with all of the mechanics it has available. It can easily overwhelm a newbie or a more casual gamer so take caution, this game is not for the faint of mind.			"

								I didn't know i wanted this game, until i got it. From The Depths is a game about both creativity and efficiency. In order to vanquish your enemies you must build up an automated army of ships and flying vehicles that can fufill it's job as efficiantly as possible. making a wodden boat with a big cannon on the front you let you get by... for a little while, but eventually your opponents will start making truly fearsome vessels, at wich point you must start thinking outside the box and approach things in different ways. I could spend litteraly days in the vehicle designer, testing designs, optimising older ones and then pitting them against enemies to see how they perform, so that i can see what i did well and what needs improving. The concept of FTD is what makes this a worthy investment, but you may want to purchase it later on. As is the way of early access games, there are things that are planned, but not in the game yet. Indeed there are quite a few missing features as of writing. There are also performance problems, mainly when huge battles take place, the game can slow to a crawl. The way I see it, if you're gonna buy one early access game, this is a great choise. I guarantee, if you like the sound of the concept alone, then you will find it worth your time. I wholehartedly reccommend this one.			"

								As you can see, I have a good amount of time spent in this game. It's not every day that you can get that many hours of entertainment for the price of a large pizza. It's not even finished yet, and there is already plenty to enjoy.PROS:Extremely impressive for an alpha build, despite having a very small dev team.Very good community interaction.Virtually all aspects of the game under constant improvement.Already has a functional single player campaign and skirmish missions, dedicated build mode, and multiplayer cooperative construction.Mod support being implemented.Multiple custom campaigns made by the community.World creation with customizable gravity, air density, water buoyancy, space altitude, etc.All built-in vehicles and structures can be examined in build mode to see how they work.Active forum community willing and able to answer questions and help players.Developers active on forums.CONS:Not a finished game yet.Performance slowdowns in some situations.Many game systems still being adjusted, not fully balanced yet.Learning curve can be steep for beginners.

								If we shall have a game that reaches the sort of omni-presence as Minecraft this decade, surely it will be From The Depths. If you are wondering if you should buy it, wonder no more. It has a learning curve but there is a good chance you know someone who has just gone through it or is looking for someone to learn with . Watch the videos if you want but be prepared to lose hours as I am sure you are going to get sucked in. It's similar to Space Engineers but it has a lot more structure and guidance. You have missions, skirmishes and campaigns. There is so much to do and it's still in Early Access. I usually take a strong stance against early access but this game is the exception to the rule. Buy it, you won't be sorry.			"

Early Access Review
								About:This game is a sandbox based around water and Aerial fights. Just for being in Pre-Alpha there is an insane amount of content in this, one of my favorite aspects is the custonizable weapons, (custom cannons and missiles). All you can do in this game so far is a few story missions and a campaign where you conquer the map while building better and better ships along the way. Infact, you dont have to build each ship block by block, you can make ships in the editor and save them, then make them in the campaign so long as you have resources for it.Creativity:This game relies heavily on your own creativity. The better you can imagine something, the better you can make it in-game. Not trying to turn people away here, because there is the workshop where you can look for inspiration for your own creations.Difficulty:This game can be very challenging when you first start as you can not just build a little raft with a cannon twice the size of the raft and expect it to float (it will sink like a rock, trust me i tried). once you get where you can build the bigger and better stuff later in campaign the bigger and better your ships can/have to be as the AI has better and better ships as you progress.Performance:I run an okay rig with about 6GB of ram and this game runs nicely, so long as you dont have anything open in the background. With me only having 6GB of RAM it takes almost all when you get into a battle with ships that fire ~4 shells a second. Other than that one small problem It runs nicely.			"

								If you ever built tanks and planes and spaceships with your Legos when you were a kid and made them fight each other, boy have I got a game for you.First off, keep in mind that this game is in alpha, which means bugs happen, performance isn't the best, lots of stuff is placeholder and things change constantly.That being said, From The Depths already has more content and replayability than 90 percent of fully developed and released titles out there, including triple-A releases by big developers.  This game is under constant, aggressive development; gameplay systems, build components, and game balance are actively being added, expanded, and improved.  There's typically at least one game update a month, sometimes more, the lead developer is very accessible, and the dev team is largely drawn from the community and is highly active with updates and feedback on the game's website forums.That's great and all, but how does it play?  Frankly, I've never been a big fan of sandbox building games like Minecraft or KSP or Besiege, but From The Depths has sucked me in like no other game ever has.  The learning curve is steep, but once you've absorbed how components and systems work you'll find that you can build nearly anything you can imagine: ships, planes, helicopters, dirigibles, tanks, submarines, spaceships, satellites, hovercraft, drones, fortresses, buildings, even mechs (well, sort of, vehicles interact weirdly with solid ground and you can't really make functional legs).  Then, you can weaponize all these these vehicles, equip them with custom AI, and drop them into a real-time strategy campaign to test out against a huge variety of community-built enemy factions.  You can even make your own campaigns on your own planets.  There is literally no end to the gameplay From The Depths offers, and it's only becoming more detailed and interesting as development progresses.I've already sunk hundreds of hours into this game.  I can't recommend From The Depths highly enough.  It's the Lego set you always dreamed of having.			"

								好像不太有中国玩家玩这款游戏，但还是想分享一下自己的感受。首先这绝对是一个由纯理科生制作出来的游戏，美工和UI的水平和一般得到“特别好评”的独立游戏完全不在一个级别。交互的反人类（复杂的载具切换 武器系统很难展现出打击的快感 舰只与飞行器操作的不方便 复杂的建造系统 难看的UI等等）很明显的说名了这一点。可如果只是这样的话我也就不会在这推荐这款游戏了这本是我steam队列里的推荐，应该是给予我对沙盒游戏的爱好。From the Depths 是一直很想要的终极沙盒（当然你可以说还有 No Man's Sky，可惜人家现在还不支持多人，而且建造元素没有这么强），上天入地什么的毕竟是一个很吸引人的IP。整个游戏应该需要一个探索的过程，由于两个教学视频好像都在 U土鳖 上所以可以挂个VPN什么的看一下。包括对英语基础也会有一定的需求，毕竟菜单选项是密密麻麻的。OK以上是对玩家的建议------------------------------华丽丽的分界线-----------------------------For developersI strongly appraciate the core of this game. Its high felixability feature is the thing that most attracts me. But it is not perfect, not yet, at least.There are some minor problems that you guys could try to dealing with:1. User interface: The current UI is not quite friendly to be honest, the construction mode is to complicated and unconvinient for building such a large scale structure such as the bettle ship. Warping from one vehicle to another is not smooth enough. Also, the UI should looks better.2. Better art design required: The texture and the shapes of different component is not yet satisfying. Is that possible to add some better visual effects in later update?That's basicly all the information I want to imply. From the Depth is definitly a fantastic game and you are all doing a great job!			"

								If your looking for a good sandbox building and battleing game then this one is for you!, With the ability to create and pilot various sea craft, subs, aircraft or even large slow moving sky fortresses.The campaign sees you landing on a broken down skyfortress with the goal of improving it and getting ready to take over other tiles of the map before the larger strong enemy fleets move in to your turf.Or if your into some quick fun you can try the various scenario modes and attempt to get a better score then your friends, you can even use your own custom designed ships and stations in them!And of course one of the last main features that was being worked on before early access release multiplayer will be a interesting addition to the madness of this game though i sadly did not have time to test that feature out.Either way i highly recomend this game and cant wait to see further updates as it develops.

								From The Depths. It's a physics sandbox game that lets you build ships and aircraft from small blocks. At first, the game can be troubling to play for newbies. Once you get the hang of it, your mind can really spread. The potential of this game allows you to build the biggest battleships with the largest cannons, or you can keep it simple and make wooden cannon ships, and be inspired by the ships of the 1700's and 1800's.I've played this game long enough to know how mostly everything works. This game is very fun, especially when you're playing with your trusty friends. I give it a 9.41/10 overall.			"

								This is essentially the greatest engineering game ever made. You can build air, land, water, and space vehicles, and great care must be taken to ensure that your vehicle is up to the task of fighting and winning against other vehicles. To do this, it needs engine power to run everything on board, a method of propulsion, weapon systems, and even sophisticated AI cores and detection equipment so it can ""see"" the enemy to shoot at it.In short, if you like building stuff to roll/fly around but Besiege was too simple for you, give From The Depths a go. I highly recommend watching Robbaz's let's play series on it if you want to see some of the stuff you can do with it.			"

								:TLDR - Excellent physics based battle block building game, where the sky is the limit as well as the depths of the ocean. Custom made weaponry from lasers and missiles to flack cannons and gatling turrets. Hours of fun and updates enough to keep it fresh. Needs polish but we can wait for that :)I have played from the Depths for quite some time now, and the one thing i will say is that the learning curve is quite steep. The sub menes and construction UI may dazzle your eyes at first, but after a few hours (took me about 4)  you will be well on your way to making AI controled ships planes and even space craft.The main fun in this game for most people (and i guess the main draw) is that the game has very few limits on what you can actually do with your creations. Want to make a submarine that can surfance and then fly ? well its entierly possible in this game as long as you know how to do it, and there in lies a problem. As the games in game manuals really dont go into enough detail on exactly how they work. After time though you will just learn these things with experimenting. Its the same with missiles - you can make so many different types - torpedos, flak, anti missile missiles flares mines  you name it you can probably make it, but the manuals dont really tell you how - only how to construct the actual functioning weapon system. The games does use LUA programing how ever and these blocks can be placed to run custom scripts and AI  on your ships, which is nice.The other main draw of this will be ofcourse - the Co-Op Campaign which is just alot of fun from the get go as all players can work on the smae construction - making some truely massive flasg ships and world destroying craft. In the campaign the AI will attack you quite regulary so its essential to protect your resourse gathering areas, how you ask ? well he is another cool feture of the game - your not just able to build ships - but you can also build structures and floating fortresses  that while are not mobile - will be able to carry the biggest and heavyist weapons you can dream of with out you haveing to worry about the physics affect that such things would have on ships.All in all - for the price - you really can not go wrong !10/10 would build massive world destroying flying ships again.

								By far the best early access I have ever played. It took my 98 hours before I felt like doing the campaign. That is only because I wanted to do EVERYTHING on ym own. Also because I though it would be harder than it was early on. I also tried out almost every vehcile type in those 98 hours. I loved all the time in vehcile designer though. Right now my best jet is an extremly cheap kamakaze. It litteraly ha a nuke strapped to the front.  You can build every kind of cannon/gun you want. There are two diffrent ways deppedning on what you want. Fast or slow, frag, explosive, flak, tracer units, so many other things too.  Also customaizable missiles. There are all sorts of designs. There are lazers but ive only dabbled in those. Ofcourse you could take the heavy handed approach and design a kamakaze. I have built tanks, prop planes, jets, boats, and everything in between. I have not made space ships or subs yet but you can! Endless designs!			"

								I cannot recomend this game enough to those who like other such engineering titles like robocraft or scrap mechanic.With weapon creation that is comparable to actual weapon engineering in depth and customizability and many different types of weapons to try. the game is updated every month with new weapons ships and armor types to equip your ships with meaning the face of war is constantly evolving. a huge open world map and 9 factions each with strengths and weaknesses allows you to use your ships and test them agains everything from lasers to particle cannons. overall the complexity of building and fantastic destruction engine makes this a very entertaining game and when you look at your boat covered with weapons and heavy armor and you know you constructed it you feel proud			"

								Wether you have 10 minutes or all day, From the depths really is the perfect game. Its a game that infuses logic and creativity in jolly cooperation. You build ships, subs, carriers, airships, sailships, Planes, fortifications, or just about any other thing you could possibly imagine!When i first seen the game, i thought it was just a Robocraft clone that costed money, I didnt realise just how wrong i was, it really is so much more...Worth every penny!

								One of the few early access games I don't regret buying.It's unfinished but already had more fun with it than most full releases, developers are responsive and work very fast.My biggest gripe is that large battles are slow on a midrange computer.Check it out if you are even a little bit into building games!

								One of the most rewarding, yet most complicated games I have ever played.PROS:-The game itself is very complex, yet not so much as to bar entry. It directly influences the reward from building right.-The ""Tiering"" is very extensive. 7 factions, each with ship in 4 subtiers of quality. Add in that speciffic builds can directly couunter other builds that would otherwise be universally strong, and you end up having a reason to build a varied fleet.-Due to both prior reasons, along with general immersion, gameplay time on this title is quite long.-A unique take on sandbox building. Despite a surface level similarity to Empyrion: Galactic Survival, it is entirely a new spin on these types of building games, derived mostly from it's complexity. You can't just slap thrusters on a box and use it. You have to plan ahead, and quite often make last moment modifications. The first game I have seen to ACTUALLY offer building that rewarded smart thinking more than abusing exploits.-The RTS feel is actually quite nice when you finally get some footing in your compaign.CONS-The interface is harder to learn than the game itself. After building a few successful models, even managing to 1v1 most of the godly enemy ships, I looked back and realized I had spent about half of my entire playtime learning to navigate the GUI. I feel that a more thorough tutorial is required on all the unlisted keybinds, menus and functions, and that this would remove a very large barrier to new player immersion.SUMMARY: -One of the best and most addicting games I have played in the past few years.-Satisfying, complex, and yet STILL open to casual players who play only a little each day.-The interface is extensively unintuituve, and thus I advise you to check YouTube or twitch for any tips on hidden screens you didn't know existed. The only significant suggestion I could give to add to the game's experience. I state this as a warning, not as a reason not to buy. It can be learned, but you will be far more pleased if you take the time to figure it out before trying to play as usual.-It is very fun to spend hours in Designer because you got your butt kicked trying to design a new ship.. Then go back to campaign and just steamroll everything in sight. It makes you feel like you learned something and it shows in volumes how much it mattered.			"

								Well, where to start.This is a brilliant little Indie game!  Extremely tactical and strategic on a grand scale.It is really satisfying spending hours creating the perfect Submarine/Ship/Airplane/Spaceship and then either controlling it yourself or watching it dominate the competition or fail miserably because of a weakness that you overlooked :)Incoming Features planned by Nick Smart, the head dev:Coop Campaign and coop in general!Even more costomisable weapons, like Rail Cannons!Even more simple non-customisable weapons!Nuclear Reactors!Many more listed here:http://www.fromthedepthsgame.com/forum/index.phpThings already included in the game and which I enjoy very much..some of these are still work in progress and are marked clearly ingame as such.  The things listed below though are functional and enjoyable :)Customisable engines...electric and diesel!Resource gatheringCharacter Development (Stats, Items, Self Buffs, Fleet Buffs)Customisable Cannons, Lasers, Missiles, Torpedos, Ships, Aircraft, Submarines, Spaceships, Ballons and Blimps!Proper physics...build your boat fully out of metal..its gonna sink!  Lose an important chunk of your aircraft during a fight, it will drop like a stone!  Unless of course your creation is a homing Kamikaze flying bomb, then you want it to do that!Anyway, so sum it all up, if you like creating, destroying, imagining or copying, this is your game!I hope you enjoy this gem of a game as much as I do.

								From The Depths is a voxel based, naval sandbox game where you construct ships, airships, and all sorts of other craft in order to defeat various campaign factions.Pros:Near unlimited amounts of freedom in creating player made designs(Mostly) Friendly and active community on the official forums, though is no stranger to petty infighting between membersCan be fun to play if you ignore all the broken and/or unfinished mechanicsCons:Has been in alpha since mid 2014Has not been updated with mechanic changes/additions since November 9, 2016 due to the developer having moved on to a ""spinoff"" (AKA: FTD redo). It is currently unknown if he will return to this game or if said spinoff will even be finished.Steep as hell learning curve, and increasing with every new added featureDeveloper tends to start work on game mechanics and then leave them imbalanced. This leads to very blatantly abysmal game balance. (One example is the fact that thrustercraft/airships are superior to similarly sized surface ships simply due to not touching the ocean, being guaranteed to be faster moving, and being invulnurable to torpedos. In some cases it is almost easier to construct airships than surface ships. This has been an issue for almost as long as the game has been in development yet nothing has been done to correct this.)Mediocre performance/optimization (lower end systems will struggle to render multiple higher block count ships at once at a decent framerate. Even higher end systems will see steep performance dips with several projectiles in the air at one time)Very imbalanced main campaign. Severe ""unit-bloat"" due to it's difficulty settings relying on having 4 different ships (one for each difficulty setting) that do nearly the exact same thing to varying degrees of efficiency. Several ""half-baked"" mechanics such as a half functioning mod creator/editor, world editor, half of the ""Advanced Projectile System"" shell modules/types, etc.Developer has promised to add several systems to the game (IE: Plasma weaponry, fire, nuclear engines) and only implemented some. (Advanced Cannons, Steam engines)TLDR; Fun game, ruined by developer incompetance. Only buy this if you're okay with an unfinished, abandoned, but still mildly fun game			"

								This game is very fun. You can build spaceships,helicopters, zeplins, battleships,submarines,Jet fighters,and jet bombers. The Dev is very friendly he works hard on making lots of updates. The Dev says he will also add land based vechiles and will add more land in the biomes at some point. Also the dev promissed graphics improvements.This is a great early access game, You are missing out if you don't have this game.don't get this game is you are expecting very simple building mechanics and controls. This isn't some souless fps game where you are instanly familiar with the controls. It takes some time to get used to, after you learn how to build stuff right and the controls which should take a brief while you will love this game. overall 10/10			"

You can buil ships, planes, supmarines, airships, tanks, cars, jets, heat seeking thermobaric nuclear missles, and fluing shark to shoots super-charged particles out of it's moutch, a underwater turbo ram, or a massive space station railgun. The possibilites are endless.The game has AI, detection, customizable cannons, different materials, physics, factions, 4 campaigns, crap tons of mods, shields, missles, and a lot more. The only thing to get past is the complexity, it took me a long time but I understand it all. Luckily, there are tutorials now, so its easy.VERDICT OF GAME:PROS:-Fun as heck yo.-Super customizable.-Tons of campaigns.-Mod support.-Multiplayer ( A little finnicky )-Decent graphics.-EXPLOSIONS! - Mr. Torgue-Customizable shells, missles, and cannons.-Density, volume, weight, bouyancy, physics.-Create a gun with so much force it can vaporize 45 square kilometers.-Nice building controls.-Sick looking faction ships.-LASERS!

								Congratulations. You've successfully descended into the world of niche titles. Unlike most others from this category, this is an amazing game. Buy it now.Not enough juicy, succulent review meat for your tastes? Then let me lead for you.This game is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Seriously, the team of two devs (I think there are only two, they're the only two I've heard about) is a wonder duo, one specializing in PR (Her name is Elizabeth, she gave me this game free!) and one for the game (Nick, he updates his game almost daily!). The game focuses (obviously) on the construction (and following demolition) of massive...whatever-you-wants, basically. You can make trains, planes, ships, spaceships(!), orbital cannons, you name it. You can even do stuff like  this . You really don't have a set goal, the play style reminds me somewhat of Minecraft. The game can fit to your personal fetishes, in my case spaceships. You're probably saying ""Meh'"" and moving on. Wait! You haven't even seen the best part.  You can completely customize your systems, including but not limited to: AI Mainframes (autotargeting and performing of customized if/then statements), Engines (focusing on either insane fuel-gulping power or fuel conservation, or a balance), Cannons (you can change ammo types, barrel  length  for increased accuracy, determine whether it's a one shot explosion or an 18 shot salvo), shields (whether focusing on a wide area with weaker deflecting, or a smaller shield capable of deflecting the strongest explosions), and even targeting system priority (for AI mainframe). Nick says he's soon gonna implement something From the Depths players have been waiting eagerly for a long time: Sea Monsters. This inspired the name of this game: From the Depths (just think here for a second)! Imagine battles like this but instead of fighting massive battleships, we will fight sea monsters! As of right now, this game is mainly focused on single player. Multiplayer exists but only comprises of simulating a battle between two ships, you can't control it (but that IS planned). Suprisingly, there actually is a campaign, but I haven't experimented with that yet. I only have minor qualms about this game-NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST IS THAT JETPACK. Seriously, that jetpack. Many times have I tried to keep up with one of my creations before it takes off, but stopped an  inch before I got to the ledge because of that jetpack. Could we at least get a noclip? Another thing: we need to be able to move a group of blocks (regardless if it's our creation or not). Last thing: we need MOAR documentation for the engines, AI, and other systems. I still haven't mastered them.Overall, this is a fantastic game. I highly recommend this to all of my friends, and to all you guys out there. Please give this adorable little game a chance in the big mean world of Steam. I wish the best to all you guys out there that play this game and to the Little Dev Team that made this little slice of history.Stay frosty, y'all.10/10 "

								Game:Build your own units block by block, customize their weapons, create fleets, romp around the map and kill other custom ships. Cannons, lasers, missiles, mines, torpedoes, missiles that turn into torpedos or mines, big warheads, small warheads, lots of warheads, guided, shrapnel, unguided...Have fun watching your custom build ship or jet or spaceship or sattelite or weird ballon-laser-missile battery munch through their targets, weep as you recognize critical flaws in your desings as they crumble and get destroyed. Watch your first iron hulled ship drop right down to the ocean floor, be happy when your first iron hulled jet-rockethelicopter thing takes to the skies, immediately fails to shoot someone but still wins because it hit and killed the enemy when it crashed down to earth after getting shot....From the depths is great fun, its a strategy game where you build your own units, block by block and then conquer the map with them. Look at the workshop to see what we predictable lot have already build.Game state:No severe crashbugs or gamebreaking gamebugs in the gameworld have been observed by me in my time of playing, which began at around mid september.I rate the game as stable and the gamepaly is already functional (construct your ships, build them  in campaign, wipe the map clean of filth colored differently than you.). Dev:The Developer has no negative trackrecord to my knowledge, the game is getting updates.Dev is active in both the steam forum as well as his own.I sincerely recommend this game. "

								There is so much to this game already is as fascinating to watch the Let's Play series on youtube as it is to play. The creative potential in this game is amazing, really humbling to see what other people have come up with. Controls take a while to figure out and putting together components such as cannons and engines can be tricky but rewarding at the same time, especially when your creations are battle tested in the campaign. The campaign is like no other I have seen. It is almost as if the designer kept saying ""wouldn't it be cool if......"" and then went ahead and built in each idea as it came into their head. This game is already brilliant and will only get better.			"

								Absolutley flawless, and its even still in early access with this level of polish! A solid game here even in this stage of development, fun mechanics, easy to learn design system, resource based consructions and real time damage on a block by block basis. Careful and clever design is key to making a solid ship/sub/plane/spaceship, build your ammo storage with too little armour and you'll get a spectacular explosion if you're hit in that area. You can customise missiles to be armour piercing to punch through like a needle or use high explosive to cause damage over a wide area, or even somewhere inbetween. You can make custom cannon turrets too, want dozens of tiny barrels firing like a shotgun or a mammoth cannon that takes 2 whole minutes to reload? Why not build 2 mammoth cannons bolted together?!This is one of the best games i've played in a while, and new features, tweaks and mechanics are in the works making this a title that just keeps delivering.Solid 9.75/10!!!!

								I honestly have to say.Like Minecrafft? Always wanted your boat to have guns? Wanted guns in Minecraft? This game is for you.Pros- This game is absolutely amazing, the amount fo customization for Early Access imrepssed me and hooked me, and the water and ship graphics are very pretty- You ""feel"" the power in your weapons when the destroy an enemy ship or aircraft.-The single player campaign is very fun, you get to take on  diverse factions. I've spent about 60 hours in one and finally took out the first one.- The AI layouts and LUA scripting do a good portion of the work for you in many aspects once you get them down. ( Isn't smart enough for LUA scripting, so that's still getting figured out. )- The guns? The ""cannons""? You have your way with them and you can create an EIGHT BARREL CANNON, and just obliterate enemies with those.- The missles are hugely customizable, just add lots of missle blocks and you got some serious firepower there.- The engines, while complex, 'sound' like they give you lots of power. You'll get the hang of it quickly, take a look at the example in the Prefab section, and you got it.- Haven't even ""touched"" the multiplayer, but I've heard nothign but good things, while buggy, works fine and there's CO-OP. WHO DOESN'T LIIKE CO-OP DESTRUCTION? (This is Early Access, so of course it's gonna have bugs, so duuuuuh.)Cons- It's early access. This is an Early Access game. This is buggy, it's getting worked on. Don't like it? Go blow up stuff in another game.- It does slow down when you have lots of blocks, so you'll need a decent computer.- Does tend to crash a lot. ( IT'S EARLY ACCESS, THIS IS NOT SURPRISING )- Does tend to freeze here and there when loading a crap ton of blocks. ( Like my massive warship of over 30,000 blocks and it's 5 fighter jets of about 15,000 blocks altogether, but again, this is probably gonna get fixed. )ConclusionThat's pretty much it. This game is amazing, I bought it a couple weeks ago and already have about 100 hours into it. it 'is' absolutely worth the 20 bucks if you want a complex, gun-toting, seafaring, explosive, ""massive"" minecraft from AWESOMEVILLE. ?While it has it's faults, you'll see from my comparisons, they are vastly outweighed by what it has to offer. Take some time to look at the controls, the tutorials -totally didn't do this part, but I had lots of fun figuring it out on my own-, and get to builidng your ships, yours gun, and claim those resource points!

								Great game, may be complex at the start but it becomes second nature after a short while of designing turret after turret...single player is full and satisfying without feeling desperately over packed or lonely. However I did start to get bored and thought it was lacking a certain something... that's where multiplayer comes in!Playing this with friends is hilarious. Arguing about designing a ship is always fun (deleting your friend's own twist on it whilst they're away and pretending not to notice when they ask about it) but to see something you both worked together on and (mostly) agreed on actually working and destroying some Deep Water Guard peasants with their petty wooden paddle boats is a great feelingMake sure you play with the right friend though... things can get messy if you play with a jackass who finds it funny to shoot a hole through your newest attempt at a battleship or taking control of a cannon you are building and using it to shoot you...I would definitely recommend this game as long as you have the time to sit down and learn some of its mechanics10/10 would use overpowered I MEAN TOTALLY BALANCED missiles to crush all who oppose my illegitimate claim to everything *evil laugh*Edit: The devs removed the original canons and now it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to make anything work as my tiny brain can't figure it all out so for now i'm moving on to easier games, still good though			"

								From the Depths is a game I could probably play forever, its a constant cycle of learning, frustration, completeion, horrible depression when you accidentialy delete the one block keeping your ship that you spent 3 hours building together, and then running back to the vehicle desginer when you find out the hard way you were not ready for the Grey Talons. Incredible game, but it's learning curve is a 90 degree angle. Worth more than i bought it for.			"

								This game Is unbelievably complex and  fun. I take hours just building and fine tuning my constructions and then go to war with them. Not only can you build Ships, but also planes subs and fortresses. Going to battle is awesome as constructions are blasted apart and guns fire constantly. The AI system lets you control a whole fleet of ships. The campaign might be a little tough but once you learn things get easier.			"

								I have no idea what I'm doing.Edit 8/9/16SEND HELP I CAN'T STOP PLAYINGEdit 8/21/16Alright heres an actual review since I really love this game.TLDR at the bottomFrom the Depths is a Sandbox, Building, and Strategy game all in one. You can make Ships, Battleships, Cruisers, Aircraft Carriers, Submarines and a hell of a lot more. If you aren't too much of a naval guy, then you can also make aviation vehicles such as Airplanes, Jets, Airships, and even Spaceships. If you aren't too much of a naval guy or aviation guy then don't worry, I'll get to that later in this review.The Official CampaignsAlright so this game has 6 main campaigns, each where you play as each different faction. The planet you play this campaign at is called Neter. I have not played the faction campaigns at all so I won't be giving a description for those since I know jack♥♥♥♥♥♥about them. But I will say which faction is for which campaign.Quest for Neter - If you wanna be independent and not play as any faction, then this one is for you. You wanna fight everyone and reign supreme? Then go ahead. You wanna make friends with other factions? Go ahead, it's your game.Of Oil and Pirates - Deepwater GuardOperation Iron Maiden - Steel StridersThe Steel Inquisition - White FlayersSurge Protection Protocol - Twin GuardThe Ascension Project - Lightning HoodsScarlet Skies - Scarlet DawnThese are the main campaigns you can play.The Custom CampaignsAlright so you might be thinking, ""This♥♥♥♥♥♥sounds easy"". It isn't. But if you want more of a challenge, then here's the custom campaigns.The Quest for Glao - Play on a different planet called Glao. The air is toxic and you require a ""Heart Stone"" in order to not die horribly by the toxic air. Not to worry, you can make one easily. You play independently in this campaign.Dangerous Waters - Are you not too creative. Are you too lazy to make♥♥♥♥♥♥ Do you love WWII? Then this campaign is for you. This campaign is set around WWII and is more of an RTS than other campaigns. You cannot build in this campaign but you can get resources and chose historically (almost) accurate vehicles that you can control. You can chose normal ships, submarines, planes, and even tanks! You can only play as the Liberty (USA) Faction in this campaign for now.Ashes of the Empire - This campaign takes 10 years before The Quest for Neter campaign. You play on Neter again, but something is very different.Originally posted by Mr.Spookyman: If you aren't too much of a naval guy or aviation guy then don't worry, I'll get to that later in this review.   That's right. Land! You finally have a (very) large open world that you can make Tanks, Cars, Trucks, and more and use them to annihilate your foes with. There are some very tiny water areas if you really want to build ships. Of course there's a large♥♥♥♥♥area for your aviation vehicles as well.These are all the custom campaigns.BuildingThere are two ways to build. Using your keyboard or using your mouse and WASD. The game recommends you using the keyboard method but I like using the mouse more as I am used to it from other building games.You have a wide arsenal of blocks and other♥♥♥♥♥♥to use on your vehicle that you are building. You can make a simple, wooden raft or Pirate Ship or you could make a mix of metal blocks and lighter blocks to make a huge♥♥♥♥♥Battleship or something like that.The building is very easy for me to use. You can make a frame of the bottom of a ship and press a simple little keyboard button that fills in the frame automatically for you with whatever block you have selected currently. You can also make both sides of your ship easily with the mirror option. You can also paint your vehicle in any colors you want.This game makes building easy and simple.GameplaySo you finished making (or spawned in) a vehicle. Congrats. Now you gotta see if that♥♥♥♥♥♥is seaworthy. You can use the vehicle creator and spawn some enemies in and see how your vehicle does. If it ♥♥♥♥s up, then try improving it or make a new vehicle from scratch. If it's victorious (multiple times perhaps?), then try the campaigns. You can spawn in your ship (or make a new one) in the campaigns but they will cost materials.Playing in campaign mode is survival mode or something like that. You make♥♥♥♥♥♥to kill other♥♥♥♥♥♥and take their♥♥♥♥♥♥that can be used to make more♥♥♥♥♥♥that kills other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Or you could just make some Fortresses in material areas that can drill out materials that you can use to make stuff with.This is gameplay for now. I might continue on it later.Conclusion and TLDRRating ScaleNuclear Waste♥♥♥♥♥♥MehOkGoodHey! That's pretty good.AmazingFlawless.This game is Amazing to me. A lot, and I mean a whole damn lot, of this game is top notch  and perfect. The reason I don't say it's flawless and say it's amazing instead is because some stuff can be annoying and can get you to start screaming at your monitor.HOWEVER, if you are a pretty chill gamer dude or Dudette who loves building, then this game would probably be Flawless for you.

								This game is without a doubt amazing! It has a very unique feel to it and the customization is done just right. you are able to customize EVERYTHING but you won't need to micro manage if you don't want to. The developer seems to be a very good guy who cares deeply for his work, and rightly so! even this early on, I call it a masterpiece as it is.There's just a certain freedom in this game that I wish bigger name developers would learn to incorporate. I really don't have any significant problems with this game. The only thing that i could possibly consider a downside is that the ai of my boats is a tad bit clunky but I'm sure the ai will be improved soon, the updates have been regular and the developer has been very dedicated from what i've seen.I would say this game is easily worth the money, good on you Brilliant Skies!

								This game takes a while to get a hang of most of the components in the game such as cannons, missiles, lasers and so on. Once you get past this stage of the game, you can get right into making some form of highly unstable derp gun that spends most of its time upside down as you don't quite understand the physics about weight distribution and you completely forget that the recoil for the cannon is over 9,000.Otherwise, this game is really good. You can spend countless hours making a vehicle that is absolutely amazing with no sign of getting bored. Once you have done that you can either take it into the games campaign or take it online and discover that pretty much everyone builds better than you do and that the ship is holier than the Catholic Church.However, due to the complexity of the game, some of the components are difficult to get to grips with, such as lua sctipts, making planes/helicopters and even making efficient cannons and lasers. The game does come with tutorials but they do not cover everything just the main things such as how to make an A.I, how to make an engine and so on.I would definitely recommend this game as it is so much fun, even when you have no idea about what you are doing and keep blowing yourself up because you forgot to put fuel in your missile.

The campaign recently got overhauled and so far has been brilliant fun.For anybody who likes your space engineers, robocraft or any other vehicle based block building game you will love this, there is a great amount of depth in every build with fully custom engines and cannons to great designs aesthetically. Hopefully with the cannon overhaul it will get even better!			"

								I spent 160 hours in the vehicle builder designing ships before I even dared try out the campaign. It might be rough around the edges but the amount of depth (some pun intended) in the game is amazing for it's price. And there's still much more for me to discover with air and space vehicles, the land campaign and the occasional special event. Well worth considering if you like the idea of making your own fighting vehicles, it'll suck up your time but you won't regret it.			"

The game is TECHNICALLY in alpha right now, but I personally would never have guessed it's in alpha from playing it.  IMO it's more complete then alot of released games these days and the developer Nick is a comlete boss.  (The only developer of any game i've ever played where I know their name lol)I'm only 70 hours (purchased 2 weeks ago) in and have another 70 to go easily before I can even begin to call myself a guru at this game.  Learning the basics really isn't that hard and literally the only limit is your imagination.  Earlier today I literally made a boat around a drill for ramming and it worked.  But then I thought...  What if the ENTIRE drill rotated while it drilled?  Took me another 3 hours but...  oh.. my... god...EDIT:  Sittin at over 800 hours now, and I'm still...  not a guru compared to some masters out there!  It was worth it when I originally wrote this review, and it's completely worth it now.			"

								At the time of review I have 35 hours and I can say happily I havent played the campaign yet. This is a really hard game with a learning curve which looks like a straight line, but man is it fun. Im personally a big fan of war games and strategy, and making one, open world-ish where you build your own ships and vehicles. Its one of the games that when you make something and watch it get obliterated infront of you, you can only blame yourself for it. Then you go back to the drawing board remaking and reinventing until you manage to defeat the weakest ship, and when I did in sandbox it felt great, but then i tried the next one up and got absolutely penetrated 10/10 would build again.

								So after a couple of hours in the creative mode making a small ship I have to say this game is EXCELLENT in its current Early Access state. Even if your creation doesnt work its still fun to try things out - I discovered that trying to weigh the front of a ship down with too much lead is not a good idea, it became a submersible ship by mistake.I have not tried any of the campaign or a skirmish so I wont judge them.The controls are quite awkward to use but with patience it does grow on you (slightly) - this being the only real gripe with the game but I believe controls can be player adjusted.Some of the video reviews/tutorials at the writing of this review were using older versions which didnt have as many options so try adding half of what you see in the videos on again10/10 so far			"

								Oh my god this game is fun if you're an engineery type like me.Make whatever you make in Minecraft, except it actually moves. And shoots! And has bad AI! But at least there is AI so you can have fleet battles.The vehicle building is really well designed in terms of controls. Feels like a basic CAD program, except a little less crashy.The campaign is a little long for me. I can't stick with it long enough to get through the Deepwater Guard, but that doesn't matter! I'm building all these boats and satellites and planes I'll never get the chance to use because the game's updates keep breaking them!And you know what? That's fine. I love the building part of this game. When I'm playing this game, I'm in the vehicle designer, and when I'm in there, usually I'm either building or just setting ships against each other in combat because the destruction in this game is excellent.

								This is, by far, the most complex exciting RTS block-building/sandbox game that I've ever run across in all my years.Imagine warcraft, but you build and design your units, block by block, even down to the missiles (and soon even the bullets!)You think ""woah, like how, as in there's heavy cannons and gatling guns and such?""No, I mean you can make one or the other, with the same ""custom cannon"" blocks.  multi-block functionality to the extreme.Now, as you can imagine, trying to fit the controls for an RTS game, alongside a sandbox game, paired with an engineering game, things can get a bit hairy when it comes to the GUI.Some people see the variety of buttons/menus and freak out and immediately hate the game because its beyond their ability to spend more than ten minutes trying to figure something out. If you actually read up on some guides or ask the community for help in understanding things, you'll quickly realize that the GUI has to be the way that it is, to allow for the complexity this game strives for.Please, don't be afraid of the buttons :-DIf you're having trouble understanding anything, just ask the community for help,  we love to tell our ""OH now i get it!"" moments :-DUpdate ->  There's now even a ""complexity"" slider, to help guide new players in understanding what blocks topay attention to when they're first starting out, in addition to new in-game tutorials and guides, as well as two different control modes.   The developer, as mentioned in almost every other review, literally listens to the community, brings home the exact type of bacon the community wants.Oh, did i mention theres a ""world Editor"" now? meaning you can create your own worlds/factions/campaigns/missions and (eventually) share them on steam? :D			"

								Have you ever heard of learning curves? Yeah, this has a learning wall.It's an incredibly hard game to get your head around. I strongly recommend watching an LP or lots of YT tutorials(TheBudkai's was good for me, although S1 will be very outdated now) if you want to play it.Once you understand this game, it's amazing. Gameplay is very rewarding, especially watching your designs destroy (or get destroyed by) your enemies' designs. Building vehicles, their defenses, their propulsion, their weapons, is extremely in-depth.You need a pretty beefy computer to get into the late-game main campaign or large vehicles, however there is a smaller campaign being worked on and the game runs perfectly fine with small vessels.The dev team are incredibly active, and clearly have an idea how the game will pan out.Honestly, the biggest con is that you'll probably end up on the NSA's watchlist for googling so much about military weaponry.

								For a game still grounded in its development, I find it to be highly addictive and fun, though somewhat frustrating, but that said, frustration is all part of a game.The total creative freedom you have with the designer for the story mode and campaign is refreshing, but the modular aspects of putting your vehicle together can be daunting and requires sitting down and really tinkering around to find the right balance of armour, weaponry and other abilities. It is not just a pick up and play sort of game.There are negatives naturally, the story mode isn't much good and with the game constantly being updated/developed, it does have stability issues. Nothing that wont be fixed in due course naturally.In conclusion for this short review, I rate it 4 stars out of five, a great game to lose yourself in for a couple of hours.			"

Great military voxel builderMore than a ""game"", this is a lego box for building military vehicles, from ships and submarines to planes and spaceships. The game is very deep and based on more or less realistic engeering of sorts, for example, engines and weapons systems are multi part set-ups with varying complexity.Not that the game lacks ""action"" at all, but you'll probably be disappointed if you expect a fast FPS like gameplay. There's a lot of combat, and you control your vehicle and weapons systems, but it's not about rapid reflexes aiming, it's more about the load out you have and how you use it.The game is still in Early Access, but there's constant updates.Be warned, there's a steep learning curve, and this plays more like a 3D modelling software than like minecraft.I appreciate the linux support.

								Score now: 9/10  Potential score: 10/10Best early access I have ever encountered. Ever. I write this as my first decent attempt at a campaign fortress is slowly being ripped appart by the AI after disabling my weapons systems. I'm not even angry - just impressed that there is so much depth in this sandbox/strategy/vehicle builder game. Block by block construction is both simple and leads to intricate detail possibilities for construction. I agree with other reviews - research & planning is essential for this game if you want to enjoy it - and ends up being part of the fun.There are numerous strategies that can be employed for the fleet & ship based fights - naval & air vehicles need to be allow for in this game. It lends itself toward letting the AI do everything in controlling ships/weapons however it is possible for the player to use both. I haven't tested out the fleet systems properly yet but going by the AI it looks to work fantastic - seriously the AI kicked my where it hurts with a pincer movement - then from above- seriously who attacks you from directly above????Any lack of documentation is made up for by an incredibly supportive and involved community - the developer has obviously gone to much lengths to ensure that all learning styles are accounted for.Replayability:*If you are like me and love tweaking those designs just that *little bit more* and getting satisfaction from a good system, I can see it proving hours and hours of additional time.*The current campaign is great for getting a feel for construction techniques and tactics to use in your own creations*Not really a story based game - but why would you think that is what you are playing forPros*Lasers*Really, really big guns*Customisable missile systems*Smart/programable systems - seriously takes hours just to scratch the surface.*Amazing tactical/strategic possibilities - I have not seen a game I would rate higher in this regard (I would love to see some tutorials on the map systems & maybe some more depth on campaign for this reason)*Very customisable interfaceCons:*Steep learning curve*Requires a level of sophisication & engineering mindset to truly appreciate it. (Think minecraft bashing creeps with a sword to using automated traps to farm them) Not truly a con but may be a consideration for gifting.*Some of the interfaces such as battle seem buggy (the intent is well documented but can be confusing when starting up)**Very customisable interface - makes it difficult to remember what key map to press for certain situations (take this as an advisement if considering how much time you want to invest rather than a con.Well recommended and cannot see what comes next as it develops. I only hope that the community gets behind it and allows it to continue to develop to its amazing potential.			"

If you buy, and you should, go straight to the ""knowledge base"", you'll find it in ""single player"". Learn everything you can. Then go to the forums and search the ""questions"" forum if you have any more questions, someone probably already asked. The community will help you, the dev will help you.

								Amazing game. Only get into this game if you love a deep game with a lot to learn and a steep learning curve. You will need to do your homework, read the forums, watch Youtube let's plays etc. to get the most out of this game. If you like engineering and building vehicles though, it is incredible fun. If you like modded Minecraft, Space Engineers, and Robocraft, this game is similar to those in some ways.			"

								(Game is still in ALPHA. So, many things I dislike are most likely to be changed or be fixed)TL;DR- This game is the best game I have ever plated, and I have played A LOT. This game is ideal for all who seek an origional sandbox or construction game, and caters to the imaginations of the engineering-minded.  I give it my highest recommendation.This game....At first it is, honestly, kinda bad;-It has an extremely steep learning curve, perhaps the steepest I have ever seen in ANY game. It took me around 2 days to learn the very basics, although to be fair there are a lot more online and in-game tutorials now than when I started playing.-The game is visually not altogether that impressive. -The game is extremely cpu intensive, and runs on a single core, meaning slower PCs will suffer, especially when there are lots of craft spawned, or lost of shells and missiles flying.That being said, this game quickly became my favourite game of all time, catering to exactly what I want in a game: A vehicle based sandbox construction and combat game with block destruction, in which near enough every aspect of what you might want to build is customisable. If you can get past the initial learning curve (which is long and steep, but not tedious), you will be greeted by an absolute gem of a game supported by a single developer (Nick) whom is perhaps one of the best game developers I have ever encountered; He listens to the community like no other, and even adds user design submissions to the base game's campaign. Speaking of which, the game features an ever-increasing number of campaigns, varying in length and difficulty. The first campaign (in my opinion, the best) features you, the player, trying to conquer the games fictional planet of Neter. In which, you'll face numerous ofher factions on a large map, with enemies varying from tanks to ships to planes to submarines, and even spacecraft, all of whih hwere designed by the community.The building/ designing aspects of the game realy are nailed. Construction, once you know the system, is quick and easy, and has few limitations. The sheer number of blocks to choose from in the build menu is also astounding, with both more available on the workshop, and more planned for future updates.The multiplayer aspect of the game is also excellent fun, having seen a bit of tlc recently, bringing greater stability, and better support for more players. In multiplayer, you can pretty much do anything you could in singleplayer, including building/ designing craft, playing through any of the campaigns, using mods, and several of ter gamemodes.There are a few additions and changes I would like to ee implemented into the game, although I'm sure these will arrive at some point in the form of a mod or an update anyway:-AI; While the AI has seen some improvements, there are a few errors and bugs here and there that still need ironing out.-More blocks, namely 8m blocks (beams, slopes, or otherwise): there are several situations where I have felt that an 8m block would be welcome, such as when blending a curve to a straight line, i.e at the bow of a ship. Also, larger or customisable propellers: the game currently features 1x1 and 3x3 propeller blocks, but they are either out of place or simply inadequate on many sedigns.In conclusion, Fron the Depths is a fantastic game with it's  foundations solid enough for it to become even better with time. If you're looking for a game that's very origional in it's design and how it plays, or are simply a fan of sandbox games or games where you like to blow stuff up, I cannot recommend this game enough, especially considering the price... If I had to score it, i'd give it about a 9/10, due to, mainly, bugs.P.S. If anyone gets past the tutorials and still doesnt have a clue, just pm me and i'll try and help you... After all, the community is part of the fun of this game.			"

								For a game still grounded in its development, I find it to be highly addictive and fun, though somewhat frustrating, but that said, frustration is all part of a game.The total creative freedom you have with the designer for the story mode and campaign is refreshing, but the modular aspects of putting your vehicle together can be daunting and requires sitting down and really tinkering around to find the right balance of armour, weaponry and other abilities. It is not just a pick up and play sort of game.There are negatives naturally, the story mode isn't much good and with the game constantly being updated/developed, it does have stability issues. Nothing that wont be fixed in due course naturally.In conclusion for this short review, I rate it 4 stars out of five, a great game to lose yourself in for a couple of hours.			"

								This is probably in my top five games of all time.  This game ate my 2015.  I probably spend 95% of my time in the vehicle designer just making new things.. and things is the best word i can use to describe them.  Such variety, I have made submarines that lift out of the water and zoom into space.  Tanks that crawl on the ocean floor. Speedboats, Jet boats, Resupply boats, Cargo Boats, Anti-air boats, Missile boats, Torpedo boats, Laser boats, Fan boats, Sail boats, normal boats and all of them in various sizes and lethalities.  Fighters, Intercerptors, Airships with balloons, Thrustercraft, hovercraft, spacecraft, Surface Attack Aircraft, Torpedo Bombers, Cram Bombers and Regular bombers.    The point is..  if you want to build it, weaponize it and use it..  whatever 'it' may be.. then this is the game for you!   WAY WORTH IT!			"

								This game is hard to not like, I want to stop playing it untill its finished but there are no other games like it. There has been talk about the mp in this game being removed and that would ruin the game for me as yes i do play the game by my self but that is in the designer. I only play the campaign with friends (which i can agree is hard to do, due to fact that this game's multiplayer is broken and hard to like). What ever you do devs/dev don't ♥♥♥♥ it because at the moment i'm really enjoying your game. Yes i would recommend.(not sure how people are calling this game complicated as it is a pretty straight forward game, you dont need the tutorials as a matter of fact I never used them)			"

								This is my story of this game so far. I've owned the game for a very long time but never bothered to play the campaign since it confused me at the time. Well, i started playing it recently and know how to work most of the HUD in the campaign. this is my story of my struggle against the deep water guard.I started off int he starting base doing the usual. Making the crappy engine much more efficient, armoring up the supply room, etc etc. well i decided to take my huskie ( my fast scouting ship ) out to find some deep water guard. i unfortunately  ran into their main force near the resource zone and tried to retreat. I failed and my huskie was a goner. i knew they would send that force to me so i build a rocket launcher that held 8 laser guided rockets and waited. Thankfully they only sent one plane and my rockets quickly dealt with it. I had more confidence and decided to build a semi expensive ( crystal wise) ship that i knew would help. I eventually built up a 6 ship fleet and decided to bring the fight to them. Short story short, i got slaughtered. i only had enough resources to build 2 ships. My small rocket plane and my rocket cruiser. i decided i would build another huskie and go scout some place since i had nothing else to do. ( i grabbed the resource zone that i mentioned earlier) i found 3 ships. They had a plunderer and 2 atlases coming for me. i decided  to lure them to my base and they destroyed both my fortresses. i reloaded my last save and decided to try taking out the plunder by destroying the ammo barrels. i rode my huskie into battle with a overpowering determination and i boarded the plunderer. i quickly punched my way to the core and destroyed it. i cheered in triumph and noticed my repair tentacles were repairing the ship, i panicked and checked the map only to realize that i captured the ship. I laughed and realized the ships gun systems were down till the core i destroyed came back to repair. i noticed the ship had plenty of repair bots and decided to man the guns myself till they were repaired. i started shooting the atlases with little affect. things were looking bad, with the ship being constantly hit by the atlases i thought i was doomed. Then, all of a sudden all the guns pointed the enemy balloon crafts and blew them out of the sky with little effort. i rode my newly captured ship back to base in excitement and knew, that the tides have turned against  the deep water guard.100/10. ill never regret buying this game.

								Genius Game.Incase you hadn't figgured out, its about building ships, planes and submarines, then using them to blow up your enemies. The campaign is so unique and definitley the main selling point. It's all about expanding territory and building bigger and better ships to declare war on tougher factions. You wont get bored of building new ships, or watching the shockwaves as they take out the ammo supply of enemies. Admittedly, it is hard to learn the controls and how to build properly.Well Worth The Money.			"

I'm getting all my friends to buy this game and they love it! Cant wait for multiplayer and I hope eventually some form of land combat will be added.(I will not lie this game requires alot of creativity and will take no more than 2 hours to learn most of the game, although youll always be learning something new.

								This is by far one of the best building games I have ever played.  It pieces together so many different things and brings it together to make something amazing.  Though the game does have an immense learning curve, you will will truely see the beauty in the game once you make something.  Then it gets crushed.  Then you scream.  Then you quit.  You come back to the game and you decide to look up a tutorial.  Your stuff actually works, and you feel awesome.  The cycle continues on and on again.  Failure, success, failure success.  If you like to build things, strategize, command, and overall love to be a badass and blow things up, then this is the game for you.			"

								Basically, when I first saw the game on YouTube, I didn't expect too much. I just bought it to have some fun with other peoples desings.As I tried to build my firs little vehicle I struggled with engine desing, guns, controls.To be honest, I had no Idea. But after a few hours of building you really know what to do, learn how to build engines and gianormous cannons.At first the build-mode is a bit unusual in comparison to games like Minecraft or Robocraft. After a short time you'll figure out how genious it is. You can build even huge vehicles very fast.The phisics are really good.Short and sweet: It is one of the best alpha-games I ever played, till now I only encountered one bug! Of course, some content may still be missing, but all in all it's really addicting. (Not sure if thats good or bad ;))			"

								The list shows more CONS than PROS, but I guess in the end the game is recommendable.I give this game 7/10.PROS- Freedom to build (space) ships, planes, submarines and land vehicles.- Lot of possibilities if you know how to program the AI.- Worth your time and creativity.- Fun to put designs to the test.CONS- Rather slow development.- Physics are a bit strange sometimes. Some update seemed to have made some of my designs unplayable. If you want stable vehicles, you need to make them big. That's okay for most people, but I like to design historical planes with realistic sizes and proportions.- Steap learning curve.- UI is a bit messy and unattractive, or at least very unpolished.- Needs high-end computer.- Multiplayer could be better.

								This game CAN be lots of fun. *Notice how I said can*From the Depths is a vast sandbox game where you basicly get to make things blow up. You can make a giant laser that fires at naval craft from space or have an aircraft lob enourmouse shells that can oneshot things. Or you can sneak around in a submarine. It has a HUGE learning curve however, but if you have the patience to learn, you'll have the basics down fairly quickly. There is almost no limintation to what you can make. Graphics could be improved quite a bit but, community made textures may become a thing sooner or later. Tl;Dr : If you didn't have the patience to read that short ammount of text then you'll deff get frustrated in this game and you should prob not get it.			"

								Absolutely phenomenal game. The beauty of it is that it is only in the alpha stages, yet it is already in incredible form. Granted, there is a large learning curve, but what is the point of a game if not to challenge you. Once you have learned the basics, the campaign is sensational. It can be set to any level of difficulty, from novice to expert. It will run on practically any computer at smooth fps even when encountering huge battles. I can only recommend this game, and for the price it is a definite ""bang for your buck"". Also, I would like to give credit to the devs and community members for creating such a fantastic game. Hope to see more progression in the coming months!			"

								Tried to get into it two times, finished a few tutorials but it didn't catched me. One review reads ""Once you hit 200 hours, everything starts to get really fun as you understand the fundamentals of this game."" I do not doubt that. Also that you can have fun before you hit a month of 24/7-gaming. But the beginning is really slow. When you only spent 1-3hrs every session you probably need a week before the gameplay sucks you in. There is some gamification within the tutorials but it wasn't enough to keep me on track several hours before being able to do the most basic stuff. Don't get me wrong: if you are ready to invest the time it will(*) pay back. And 20€ for a game were you can dump hundreds of hours in is a good deal. I'd payed more for less and was happy. (*) very low play time compared to others so this is an assumption. But reading the other reviews I tend to believe that. I do not regret the deal and I will come back and try it again ... two or three times ... maybe four. Also, maybe the starting phase will be improved as the game improves. Do not skip this game just because of this review. Just be warned: you'll have to spend some time before it's fun.			"

								Great game, decent amount of depth (no puns please) and i love the keyboard based building style, cant see why no one thought of it before, makes things so much tidier and faster once you get it down. That will be the theme for this game, should you decide to play it. Getting it down. You will spend every minute of playing this game getting something down. You will learn how to build an engine. How to build a ship. Realise both your ship and engine suck so hard, they should be called The Dyson Mk I. You will re-learn how to build an engine. You will put that engine into a new ship. You will build a cannon. Your cannon wont work. You will rage. You will learn how to build a cannon properly. You will realise now that this is the ultimate learning curve simulator of all time. You will play. All day. E'rry Day. Occassionally, you may speak to your family and be reminded that they seem like nice people. One day, you may get down the life-work-FTD balance. But it wont be any day in the next fortnight. The learning curve is real and its called From The Depths. 10/10 would re-design ship 15 times before having nervous breakdown and coming back tomorrow.			"

								I don't do alot of reviews but FTD is one of my favorite games right now.First we are gonna start with the good parts of the gamePros: (Ill break these down in a little)Its ComplicatedSomething new to do everytime you launch it. Updates pretty often. Amazing Cusomization of weapons, ships, and even engines. Lets Break It Down.The engines and weapon system in the game are complicated. im not going to lie, To this day I still am finding new combos to use with my Turrets and MisslesSomething new to do everytime you launch it, By this I mean that you can always build new things, Try new gamemodes and just have something new to build every time you launch it. One day you could build a speedboat and the next a Huge battleship or even a jet or bomber. Its honestly one of the most user dynamic games ive seen. Updates, Updates for this game are well done and well announced. He posts the features of each update on steam and on their fourms. He also asks the community what they would like to see. Its a small dev team and the rate of their updates makes Dayz Standalone look abandoned. *The last point i addressed in the first two points*Now, To the cons. This game's multiplayer requires Godly internet. The multiplayer isnt optimized as well as lets say Minecraft or Space Engineers. But I digress. Bugs. This game isnt perfect it has its share of bugs but thats expected from an Early Access game.I personally enjoy the game alot and I am starting to play it alot more just because of the recent new updates. The Idea of the game is great! And the way they are going with it looks very  promising on the fact that you can literally make a Giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and send it flying at enemys with a nuke, If thats your kinda game play. Anyways. I really suggest this for people who like Space Engineers and Scrap mechanics. It has great water physics and alot of complication to its gameplay.  "

								There is something about this game that makes it great, somthing bigger, more rewarding, more incredible than just about any other game, you play CoD for 50 hours, and what do you get for it? some pretty skins for a gun? Not exactly a motivator,           but this game, it gives you that somthing special-- special like I've never seen before in any game. That feeling is true, genuine acomplishment, I learned that with my very first ship, lovingly named the lancer, it was a sleek heavy hitter, based on elysium's frigate-- smashed every DWG ship in the game, and a quick adjustment to the missiles to use EMP destroyed every OW ship in the game, I loved it, it was my baby, every ship after that was just the same, there isn't a single other game that can match that feeling, I even learned Lua code just to optimize my missiles! don't get me wrong, there are a litany of issues with this game, not the least of which is messing with the AI, but other than a few quality of acomplishment (life) issues, this is an amazing game, one I cannot shower enough praise upon.P.S--I've had this game for a while now, and I can assure you, I've played more than 60-some odd hours, and it's been an excellent experience. I still remember when I first got the game, and had been inspired to get it by people like EnterElysium, (watching their videos was invaluable to helping me with the harsh learning curve involved with picking this game up).

								Build fully functional and fully customiztable warships, aircraft, spaceships, naval and land bases, submarines, coastal defenses, then send them to battle under AI control, or pilot them yourself.And if you think that default AI does not cut it, you can code your own AI for your vehicles in LUA. Name one other game where you can program your units in an actual programming language without leaving the game. I'll wait.The most innovative game in last 5 years.Still under heavy development, updates come often (weekly/monthly).Learning curve to build things from scratch might be steep, but you can load, study and use/pilot all builtin designs in the campaign.10/10, this is hot stuff.

								It's complicated. You need to learn a lot, You need to watch/read tutorials, you need to think a lot, you need to refine your designs a lot... You're going to fail a lot. But once you get good it's so damn satisfying that Dark Souls seems like a casual game in comparison! The moment when you manage to hit that damn little annoying flyer or when your massive self designed guns blow a football field sized hole into the ship you feared before... That moment Is PRICELESS! You are proud of what you built, but you know there are bigger and scarier things out there. If this sounds like something you would enjoy, this game is for you. I barely played anything else since I bought this and I love it! There are more than enough good and easy tutorials out there to learn so don't be scared of the learning curve. If you like building stuff and you like explosions and cool ships/planes/subs/airships/stuff you should really try this game! :)			"

								10/10 you need this, its addicting, the depth of detail in things you can create is astonishing, this is the best $20 I've spent on a game in a long while, I enjoyed Robocraft until their new updates, but this, is just, MIND BLOWING! If you enjoy creating AI controlled war machines then this game is for you, If you prefer to pilot your death machines, this game is for you, if you want to make a massive metal monstrosity that has a huge engine that creates tons of power and gets terrible fuel efficiency, this game is for you, if you prefer a more environmentally friendly approach to destroying things, by all means make a wooden sailboat and cover it in cannons, don't like boats? make a submarine, or a plane, or an airship, or a giant flying sky fortress, or an orbital space station that can rain death upon all who oppose you, or create a swarm of AI drones to spam at your enemies, really the possibilities are ENDLESS, with constant updates and a responsive developer this game is worth every penny!

								Oh yeah. This is the real deal. This is what would happen if you threw some random guy into a mostly water planet, and throw in some other factions that (may) try to kill him, and to protect himself, he has to build boats, but he is clueless.The first few attempts the guy makes, his ship is too slow, flips, sinks, and ends up a sinking mosaic.The next few attempts he has to thwart pirates so he makes a decent, tiny little boat that destroys one, two, three blocks and then it gets blown up by a missile. Thankfully the starter fortress is a godsend and saves him from a buttkicking.A lot of attempts pass and somehow he makes a... plane? That kills one of the easy pirate ships with an atom bomb Kamikaze design! Yay!A few more attempts and he makes an average medium ship with a balanced... well, everything! It gives even the pirate designs a run for their money with a shield that bounces off most projectiles and missiles.*Spongebob time card*3 days laterHe finally manages to conquer Neter with his awesome reusable Kamikaze design somehow because the plane's diving at the enemy so fast, the turrets can't catch up!From humble beginnings (a crappy raft) to conqueror! (awesome kamikaze design)My experience so far;1st campaign (a little hard difficulty): A disaster in every way possible. Couldn't attack fast enough to do anything, and it ended in defeat with no resources left, so repair was impossible.Multiplayer (average difficulty): Learned about shipbuilding, engines, cannons, not so much missiles, and the fact that other people are better than me. Ended when I accidentally smushed too many ships together and crashed the game for the both of us.Another multiplayer session (average difficulty): Much shorter, learned about balloons, flying, etc. Ended when the game host just decided to quit.2nd campaign (very easy difficulty): A success so far, first upgraded the starter fortress, then made a mess of balloons that could somehow go to 3100m above the air (3.1km!) that saved ME from a buttkicking by just living, so that I could drop down as me and explode the enemies. 2 moderately difficult designs that got butchered just by this one plank of wood with 2 antennas attached to it for scouting, LOTS OF BALLOONS, and NO WEAPONS. Reminds me of the movie Up... then, just today, I made a breakthrough and made a working AI (well, who knows it hasn't been tested... yet) for the starting_rib with 2 crappy cannons with the minimal gauge and just 2 barrels!A wonderful experience. And a worthy substitute for the entire public education system if used correctly, in my opinion. It has all the strains and benefits of learning in a fun package! Imagine of the public schools were replaced with From the Depths schools, good lord, that would (prooooooooooooobably) never happen.			"

								Epic. Just epic.I tend to shy away from Early Access nowadays, given the recent disappointments like Starforge or Towns, but this definitely hit the sweet spot of EA.The sheer scope of the premise, given with the activity and apparent competence level of the developer made this pretty much an instant buy. It also has a pretty good AI (one that even the player can use, too), so it offers a ton of replayability already. A campaign with resource gathering, diplomacy, hell even a working RPG system with levelups are there to tamper around with. Didn't even factor in things like multiplayer or co-op, which are still pretty much a work in progress.Also, the physics are pretty nice. Recoil has an actual impact, parts breaking off of your vessel can make you lose control, and weight will make you sink to the bottom of the ocean, whereas airtight compartments on a metal ship will keep you afloat, unless breached and flooded with water.If you like Kerbal Space Program or Starmade, or if you like the big, humming multiblock machines of certain Minecraft mods, you're probably going to love the hell out of this. Oh yeah, there's space, too. Orbital cannons raining down fiery death on submarines are possible and encouraged. And don't worry, the graphics are going to get an overhaul, too. Now stop reading and go buy the game D:			"

								Aright, so here's the thing. This is a great game IF you're willing to sink obsessive amounts of time into it. This is by no means a casual game as there is simply too much content to be absorbed across any number of ten minute sessions. If one isn't willing to make that committment to learning, this game is not for them.Reasons to play this game:+Excellent physics, especially for a voxel box-esque game.+Build literally any sort of vehicle you want. You want a spaceship that doubles as a submarine? No problem.+Story missions that test the depths of one's abilities.+Fully customizable weapons platforms. I don't think of my laser guided missiles so much as missiles as they are long range sea mines that happen to fly.+Intuitive and shockingly convenient vehicle automation.+Nowhere as resource intensive as one would think it would be.Reasons NOT to play this game:-Steep learning curve. Building more than basic boats and engines is not for the faint of heart.-High time commitment.-Build interface is clunky and plays less like a game than a 3D drafting program.-Controls frequently inconvenient and limited in customization.-Stock vehicles for story missions seem unabashedly bad. Namely one critical, otherwise easily fixed flaw, like leaving the driveshaft of a gigantic drill completely exposed... "

								Bought the key for this game on another game selling site for 7 bucks less than here.  Learning to use the construction editor in this game is a bit of a challenge but not that bad.  And once you learn it, constructing things in this game is far easier and QUICKER than any other similar building game that I have!  Especially if you take the extra time to learn how to edit using the keyboard method as opposed to using the mouse method.  In a very short time, Ive constructed quite a large and stable hull complete with power train installed.  Next Ill focus on making the top side of the ship look cool.  Later Ill get into experimenting with my own engine builds and the like(right now Im using one of the games pre-fab engines).  If you are creative, like to design and build cool looking things that you can then test for functionality, and even get in battles with what you've created to see how it holds up, then this game is definitely a must have for you.

'Start with a ramming boat, it's the best boat you can make against the first enemy boats.'So i went east. Found my first targets... 1 boat with 20 cannons on it...And 3 flying bombers. A ramming boat. Against aircraft.They destroyed my boat.I warped back to my fortress, start getting resources to make a new ship.And again, same guys, but now they come to me...Well now i got a cannon, right?Well, they went ABOVE my fortress, where my gun can't aim.And they destroyed my fortress. Lost an hour of my time playing this today.And you know what? I recommend this game. Really.			"

I have only played this game a little... just a little bit... maybe... 350 hours ._.So anyway. i have this game for a while now and i really love it. the amount of things you can do in this game is just Absolutely insane! especially for an Alpha game. Here are pro's and con's: Pro's: - Great graphics for smooth gameplay. - A lot of things to do in this game, although its the same everytime. - Its the same every time, but every single battle is different than the last one you played. - Very great AI controlling. - lots of factions with their own style with even their own BackStory's! - Very long campain. - lost of varients between Weapons and vehicles. - Even Space vehicles 0.0 - Easy but difficult campain at the same time. - The lagg isnt skipping frames, but slowing the game down.Con's: - Some bugs here and there, doesnt ruin gameplay for most of them. - Lagg with larger battles. slows it down, doesnt skip frames. - AI is derpy sometime :)That was basicly it. it is a Very, Very cool game if you ask me :)Greetings From Me :)			"

								From the Depths is an extremely satisfying game. It is the perfect blend of all my favorite sandbox games. However, it is very complex, from designing your very own engine, to getting the thrust to weight ratio perfect, all the way to creating artifficial intelligence to control your weapons that you created.Pros: There is so much variety in this game, anything you want to do, you can.Ample amounts of tutorials are at your fingertips, as a beginner I had no troubles learning how everything worked.For an alpha game, it is suprising how optimized it is. I have not dropped below 60 fps once, even with large vehicle battles surrounding me.You can create any sized vehicle as long as you design it correctly. From 4 x 4 rafts, to 300+ x 300+ Airships.All of the controls and graphics are 100% customizable, so you can have the perfect game experience.The developers have been great at constantly updating this game, I am certain this won't be the same ""sell & run"" experience that we get with so many early access games. (DayZ, 7 Days to Die, etc.)Cons:The multiplayer is not yet developed, but the developers say they will be coming out with a fully functional multiplayer.To the faint of heart, the building system might be difficult to understand.Do not let the complicated mechanics of this game get you down, this is a near perfect game for me, and it has only been out for around a single month. Give this game a shot, for $20 you can't get anything better. Final Rating: 9/10 Note: This will be 10/10 with the finished multiplayer. "

								I haven't had many games that captured my interest as this one has. Sure, it isn't a finished product, but you can build stuff, and then customize the heck out of whatever you just built, and then build on your customizations with further modifications. I like games that allow you this kind of freedom. It's the type of game that says you can have as many guns, and as much armor as you like. You'd better be prepared to have your hopes and dreams dashed if it's poorly set up, however. Oh, I haven't mentioned the developer yet. He's an amazing guy, active in the community, gives feedback on suggestions/bug reports, etc. Too few games nowadays can boast that as well.			"

Have you ever wanted to design a plane that used cannons as a means of movement? Me neither, but in From the Depths, YOU CAN!From the Depths is a sandbox physics game with some rts elements thrown in for good measure. Build a ship, watch it sink. Build a better ship, one that moves! ....Then watch it get blown up. Build a gun, then build a ship around it! This is, in essence, what FtD is all aboot.In career mode you can take your designs and put them to the test. Capture resource nodes, battle pirates, and build your empire. Switch from game view to map view and position your fleet. Instead of rolling the dice when two ships meet, go back into physics mode and battle your enemy head on. You can manually control your vehicles and bases, or you can use the modular AI pieces and build an AI to do it for you.Speaking of modular, this game features modular engines, cannons, lasers, missiles, etc. Instead of placing a gun block where you want a gun, you can build your cannon from many modules that altar how the gun works. Range, reload time, damage, armor penetration, explosive rounds, accuracy, etc.			"

								This game runs in the vein of others such as kerbal space program, starmade and space engineers. The difference being it is heavily focused on combat and fleets of units rather than a single craft. It has a steep learning curve so it can be daunting at first although there are quite a few videos and guides out there to help you on the more complicated things. The satisfaction from getting your fleet afloat and firing a hail of cannon shells and missile streaking towards the enemy is akin to glee as you watch the enemy fleet explode into little bits.Somewhere between a simulator, rts and a fps all rolled into one, its not for everyone, but for those with a creative streak its a highly addictive mix. For those with less patience they can always use the vehicles created by others from the workshop or FTD forums to get straight into the action.Once the co-op campaign is finished I doubt there will be any other game I'd rather play than From The Depths for a long time			"

								This game is realy cool im suprised how i havnt noticed this game till now well anyway the core mechanics of the game is very good and especialy the ai and how u can make the ai take control of ur weapons or movement or everything just imagine the multiplayer how u can make a fleet of your custom destroyers and aircrafts then when u go to battle its not like ur picking a fight ur picking a war lawl with the physics and everything getting destroyed its just like the perfect game but the controls is a bit awkward at first its not like they are bad but u will get used to them later on.

Now if you excuse I must get back to building my dreadnought. Great game I'd says it's pretty well worth it. And contrary to what's said here I went to the From The Depths forum and it's still being worked on. With all of the technical stuff this game goes into I can get why it takes time for updates to come.			"

								I initially gave this game a bad review. I regret that now.The time willingly put into playing this game makes up for the price paid. Therefor I know that players who enjoy constructing war machines of all kinds will enjoy this. So far the ship I've made floats and is agile after the second construction - that's more than can be said for the 20+ flight tests you go through on Kerbal Space Programme. It functions, and in that sense it isn't hard.I simply wish the learning curve wasn't as steep in other ways. For example, I still don't really understand the mechanics behind custom cannons and other complexset-ups, even with tutorials. This could be on account of my own stupidity, but in a way I would prefer simpler options that produce the same results or at least a simple pictorial diagram of a simple, working set-up (like my dads old haynes manuals from the 90's - for the primitive man).

								It's pretty much what I have dreamt of. I still can't believe this is a real thing. I really like the building controls, but there is a minecraft style option if you can't grasp them. Designing big ships is funner for me than designing small ships, problem with that is my small ships start to become big ships. ""Hmm.. this could use a laser system, will have to upgrade the engine then. Eh, I've got the space, may as well put in a missle system. I wonder if I can get this to fly...

								From the Depths (FtD) is a game I highly recommend to people who like a learning curve in their games. This is a kind of game where you can show off your skill and power to your friends because you put in the time and effort to master the game. If you are a lazy person who likes playing games like Call of Duty just because they are easy, don't get this game. The game itself is a pretty interesting sandbox game where you can build ships, fortresses, planes, and even land vehicles. Most of the game revolves around the ships (hence the name, From the Depths) which all have main components like engines, propellers, rudders, AI cores, weapons systems, and etc. Each of these components will need to be learned individually and will function together to make your ship. The game allows for a lot of customization with its parts.  I think that this game really shows what you can be capable from learning from a game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested.-TheNileCroc07[EDIT] By the way, the achievement of completing the first tutorial is broken for me. If anybody else has this problem, please tell me in the comments. Also, its still cool [11/23/2016]			"

								This block based, build anything you like combat simulator is better than sliced bread with peanut butter and jelly. I mention peanut butter and jelly because this game isn't just the bread, but comes with a metric s**t ton of hidden features that will amaze the armchair war machine engineer for days, weeks and months. From Age of Sail frigates to Space Battleship Yamato, build every darn war machine you've ever dreamed of in childhood and make them dominate subsurface, sea, air, land, and space battles with your arsenal of custom designed guns, lasers and missile systems that are near fully customizable. Anything is possible, prepare to be amazed by the hundreds of example ships packaged in the singleplayer missions, they're absolutely dangerous and creative, from submarine rams to paddle boats to flying fortresses and laser armed behemoths that ascend far beyond human engineering. And all that from a small selection of Minecraft style blocks!			"

								If you like Minecraft, Robocraft or any of those types of building games then this is probably a game you would enjoy. Building is similar to both, with more options and different types of blocks available. I have several hundred hours on both Robocraft and Minecraft, but prefer this game in terms of creativity and open endedness. There are no blocks to unlock, credits to earn, and all features are available from the onset. In the campaign, building is limited by resources, which you gather in zones or by defeating enemies. In sandbox mode, building is unlimited and design generated there can  be built in the campaign. Since it is still in alpha stage, changes are continually coming out and not all in game features have been implemented. It is primarily single player, and the campaign mode works but again as an alpha, it can change as updates come out which can be pretty frequent as the developer is VERY active. The world it takes place on is mostly water and the game's focus is primarily water based ship building and combat, however aircraft, submarines, balloon craft and, to a limited extent, even spacecraft are possible. Land based craft are in the works and ground based structures are possible. There is currently 4 types of weapons available: projectile (cannons, machine guns, electromagnetic gauss), missiles, energy based (lasers and particle cannons) and simple types like rams and drills. Most have different parts to make them configurable for different effects and potency. The only downside to this game is the learning curve is VERY steep for some of the more in depth or advanced functions and the enemy can be very difficult in the later stages of the campaign and the multiplayer aspect is limited. Fortunately, the game difficulty can be tweaked and the campaign is optional. You can just build in sandbox mode and pit your designs against each other (or the built in designs) if you choose. The Steam Workshop also has very many designs from the community (many are exceptional and are even in the game itself) and the user interface is very easy to use and vehicles and structures are  easy to install and can be used in the campaign or sandbox. I have not experimented with multiplayer at all, so I can't  comment on what it entails or how well it functions. Overall this is a fun builder type game in which I have spent over 2000 hours on and continually come back to. I highly recommend it.  "

(or is it both?)You can build your own creations with customizable AI (Naval AI, Aerial AI, Target prioritasation etc...) make them fly go underwater OR WHATEVER THE ♥♥♥♥ YOU WANT.I love games with customisation and i searched for an FPS for years where i can build a orbital missile array and call an airstrike on my enemies,although i woudnt call this an FPS its the closest to what i searched for for years.BTW if you looked at the in-game hours of the people making reviews for this game you probably noticed that this game is INSANELY addictive (but you do have to learn A LOT, ITS INSANE).PS im from switzerland so please excuse any grammar faults.

								Quite a good block-based building game. Although the game's genre is focused on naval battles, you can build ground vehicles if you so wish. You can create various weaponry for different roles: Flak cannons for your battleships; CRAM cannons for your artillery; or LUA-guided missiles for Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground or vice-versa. There are wheel blocks for land-based vehicles, but they are highly neglected, and I hope they are worked on soon; as you can create some stunning tanks with various shell types that will surely catch the interests of many War Thunder players, such as myself.Pros:A vast selection of parts ranging from lightweight metal alloys and ERA armour to LUA script for AI mainframes and various cannon types for both beginners and professionals.Stable multiplayer capability, although some bugs should be ironed out, such as the lack of Prefabs and host-only barrel-number selection for advanced cannons.Cons:You need a good graphics card to run this game over 30 fps at 1080p. I had around 15 on 720p with my old GT 620 (came with my prebuilt computer), now I get 60fps on 1080p at high.All-in-all a fun build game for Land, Air, and Naval vehicles.			"

								I don't know if I'll ever fully understand this game, but the ability to constantly learn more about it and use it to improve my ship designs has captivated me for this long. Also, having a campaign where I get to use these ship designs certainly makes it even better. Definitely worth my money and time.			"

								Alright. If you are not into really long reviews then this is not for you. I am just going to explain all the pros and cons to this game with detail.To start off with: The game is very fun depending on how much time you are willing to spend outside of the action. What I mean is that if you want constant action then you are not going to enjoy this game. This game is about spending time building a creation and updating all the issues about it and making it look good until you are proud of it. As I have already said: If you want constant action then don't get this game. Have patience.I really love this game because I find the battles fun when I use my new creations. The AI is rather challenging but sometimes there are a few issues. This can be the enemy fighting a fight despite the fact they will loose it without a doubt. It just slows the game down. I would rather it were so that the AI regroups into a larger fleet or scraps small ships to make large ships. But nonetheless all the factions are challenging at times.The tutorials are a little confusing to get the hang of at the start. But I first thought advanced cannons were impossible to make when they were introduced and within a day I got the hang of them and now I can build them without any issues. If you need serious help then watch videos made by lathrix/lathland.The very few issues I have about the game is that the game is not amazingly optimised. What I mean by this is that if I wanted to fight a battle against the Damascus (steel striders main base) I can barely run the game. Yet I can run most ships rather well. Another problem I have with this game is that the updates tend to take a while to come out. You might have the odd patch every now and then but even that is annoyingly slow. But at the same time, when updates do come out they tend to be good. The latest update is the steam engine and I think that it is really cool. I personally love the animations of that but hell, other games can thrash that.Furthermore the AI factions are... Well don't do much. They attack you sure but that is about it. When two factions start off at war with each other you should be able to see them fighting. And they never really have proper diplomacy either. You cannot plan with them to make an attack somewhere. You cannot go into their land. At the moment there is no point in becoming allies with someone.My last problem is the storyline. Whilst the game is fun it is also a bit confusing. The whole talk about the White Flayers betraying the Steel Empire and cutting off their power ect, Does not make sense to me. This is truly because the only thing close to an actual person is the npc... And what I mean by the npc is a floating robot with 1 shotting machine guns on either side. Furthermore you never see cities. That is my one huge problem with the storyline. There is talk of power supplies as I mentioned earlier and all that good stuff. But there is nothing there... The closest thing to a possible city are the lake towns (which are tiny) and the main base. The game needs to be improved in that aspect. Overall I love this game anyway, the game is fun and I rarely have any bugs with this game. Though again it does require patience and a lot of learning.			"

								Absolutly love this game, i have over 360 hours on it, defiintly one of the best games ive ever played. Its many building options works for all diffrent styles, wether you like sci fi super ships, or want just realism, its perfect for both. The game also has constant updates which always freshens up the game. This game is also is very complciated and takes a while to really get the hang of, but when you do, its awesome. Extreme learning curve. It actually takes a little inteligence to be good at this game, or at least a lot of playing time. Great game, if you like building anything your mind can come up with, this game is for you. I highly recomend this game.ProsTons of Building OptionsCool CampaignYou can build anyting you can think of.

								One of those games that has a hard learning curve and its still actively being worked on with some place holder stuff but form what is there. There is a good game with rough edges. Memory leak issues but if you want a game where you can build a ship and not just choose hard points then make a fleet of them, hell you can even make planes, zeppelins, space ships, submarines with guns that you build yourself. You can make a flying air craft carrier for fighters then let them swarm the boats below or just have the sky blanketed in rockets. How your ship works is up to you, or just go the lazy rout and take over Ai ships and use them as your own, ram, rocket, canon or even laser your way into their hull and take out their AI core and its all yours. So what the game is, its fun but takes hours of learning to not get taken out by the smallest of rowboats. Normally I would say avoid Early access games like the plague but if what I said interested you go ahead and take a look at a few videos of the game and see if this game is for you. :)			"

								Prepare for mass rage and rage quits.I love this game, I've only played about ~20 hours but I've learnt a fair bit. The learning curve is like getting hit in the face with a bowling ball. If you are going to buy the game prepare to do countless hours of research on how to play the game.The game itself has one simple objective, destroy the opposition; Simple right? Well it is if you know how to construct might war ships and planes whilst also keeping an eye out for enemy fleets and keeping an eye on your own. Distrubuting resources left right and centre and all sorts of multitasking that I cannot perform because I'm just simple minded.But if you know how to play your cards, and can learn the fundementals quickly then you're going to have 100s of hours of just pure fun bombarding with every missile, cannon and railgun you can muster. At the end of the day its just another war game but in my view it is one that stands out above every other war game because of just how unique it is.I could go on explaining the pros the cons and every detail inbetween but I think I've said enough to show how good it is.10 Kitkats out of 10 "

								From the first time you begin crafting your own vehicle -- varying from seagoing vessels, to aircraft, to spaceborne vehicles, with the promise of land-based vehicles on the way -- it's clear that From the Depths takes the mechanics of crafting your own personal vehicle to an extent that most other games haven't dared. Without naming any names, this isn't a game where you get predefined hulls with a drag-and-drop parts list to min/max stats; instead, you have to build the vehicle from the ground (or keel, as it were) up, making sure to provide it with an engine, an AI system that needs to be wired into the weaponry, and the weaponry itself. And even weapons are completely crafted -- the more powerful or accurate you want it to be, the more resources and room it takes up, forcing players to find the perfect balance between making their ultimate gun(s) or missile launcher(s) and being able to fit it on their hull.The lego-like simplicity of building your ultimate war machine is offset by a few pragmatic concerns you need to observe -- key above all is a physics system requiring balance as a mandatory part of design. Tempting though it may be to make your ship completely out of steel for maximum armor, it will also sink like a brick, maneuver like one, and cost an arm and a leg. And symmetry of design is necessary for the same reason -- making a spaceship that's got a Millennium Falcon-esque vibe to it will lead to tears when you realize that it has an off-center balance.Criticisms for this game, from my perspective, revolve mainly around a few important points. First of all is that, beyond the sandbox building, there isn't much to be seen from a gameplay perspective (YET, if this game's hype doesn't rapidly exceed the creators' abilities). The campaign, such as it is, is an ill-explained board game type strategy game, where you move your fleet around and capture resources. You drop into a fight against enemy ships/aircraft, defeat them, move on. Beyond forcing the player to maintain resource caps, it has no real sense of depth at this stage in development. The other is that, while in some extents the building is great, it falls flat in the departments of variety and (despite praising it before) complexity. There are all of 5 basic block types, and turrets have an unfortunate tendency to look the same, no matter the size, number of barrels, or parent vessel. And while it's neat to have to attach weapons to your AI's mainframe through 'wiring', said wiring comes in the form of specific connector blocks -- forcing you either to build turret mounts bigger and bulkier than you intended to protect these vulnerable pieces (without which your AI can't fire the weapons), or you leave them exposed to enemy counterbattery.How might these issues be corrected? I'm not even gonna play armchair dev and try to say, definitively, what the fixes might be, but I can offer ideas:1.) Allow research and/or 'backwards-engineering' in the campaign. Lock certain pieces (the 'extra' parts that can be attached to an engine to increase its capabilities, i.e. superchargers) and make it possible to either research their usage or capture the technology when fighting enemies. Ditto for varieties of blocks beyond wood.2.) Turn connector pieces into 'wired blocks', with armor available based on base material just like normal building blocks, and in exchange an escalating price scale.Is From the Depths worth it at this point in the cycle? Well, it depends on whether you really enjoy building stuff. If this is your cup of tea, you can sink hours into the 'game' as it stands at the moment. If you (like me) desire a balance between sandboxing and kicking over the castles in the sandbox a few minutes later, the game is far too underdeveloped at this stage... and anyone looking for an action-packed experience is in for a bit of regret.

								Game definitely is aimed to the audience, who love voxel, sand box, experimenting and engineering games types, but yet with demanding learning curve. It may appear at beginning this game is difficult to handle, but once you get into it, it is so much fun. There is plenty of tutorials available for new and old comer, on the official forum http://fromthedepthsgame.com/forum/ on Youtube, Steam and what is interesting, in game itself.So what you can do? Well actually A-Lot...1. You can play in creative mode, building your own designs, structures, fortress, vehicles (submarines, naval ships, air ships, space ships, or any of mix of them and more)2. You can play campaign, fight against AI driven factions (player made vehicles), in form of RTS, or/and FPS, while you can develop your own designs and forces, as long you got enough resources.3. Test your own designs against your, or other players' designs. 4. Making your designs to behave, as desired, which may be challenging.5. Design your own weapon systems, both offensive and defensive.6. Setup your vehicles and weapon system AI behaviours.7. Experiment with anything, you got access to.8. Making ""block"" art.9. And whatever else your imagination allow to ..10. Download and share your designs with the community, on Steam and main forum.11. Share and gain experience with community12. Join player hosted tournaments and test your secret design against other contestants. Results are tend to be uploaded to youtube. For example by TheBudkai, but not only (youtube channel) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmkTaK7E7RJouOrgdGANTTna-_5J6fVYL13. On main forum, players opinion really matter. Players have great input, in which games is getting developed. Bugs are dealt very quickly.At some point you may face you know all, when suddenly facing enemy, with stuff, which you are never thought of. Then you may realise, you are barely hit iceberg tip of FTD possibilities :)So what more about my own experience? Oh well, I love this game, since I have gotten it in Feb 2014. Since then FTD is still in Early Access, so it is something to keep in mind. But this means, it is constantly changing, adding more and more fascinating features. Always something new to learn. Cannot get bored, if such games is what you are looking for. I play mainly creative mode, testing game's possibilities, my imaginations  and applying my childhood dreams :)Examples http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998578301/myworkshopfiles/So what you may need to be aware of, before getting in FTD?1. High learning curve is expected. 2 hours of play, will not give you full FTD experience.2. Imagination is your main limitation.3. I know many players wait for player vs player battles, but unfortunately multiplayer is disabled atm., as it is completely reworked at the current, to handle players better. It will be possible to run also multiplayer campaign, which sound really cool. I have been running few multiplayer events, before this mode has been disabled and they were so much fun, with smaller and bigger vehicles. Some example is here:

I am waiting, like you may also do, for multi return. This should be soon I hope, with much greater possibilities :)4. Unfortunately, bigger designs and battles, require better PC. So don't expect Bismarck, or Yamato ships run smooth on the low end machine. But running smaller battles, with smaller vehicles run smooth and they can be so much fun. So you don't need high spec machine to enjoy FTD.And there is much more cool things, I can not think about now and I could write ...			"

And symmetry of design is necessary for the same reason -- making a spaceship that's got a Millennium Falcon-esque vibe to it will lead to tears when you realize that it has an off-center balance.Criticisms for this game, from my perspective, revolve mainly around a few important points. First of all is that, beyond the sandbox building, there isn't much to be seen from a gameplay perspective (YET, if this game's hype doesn't rapidly exceed the creators' abilities). The campaign, such as it is, is an ill-explained board game type strategy game, where you move your fleet around and capture resources. You drop into a fight against enemy ships/aircraft, defeat them, move on. Beyond forcing the player to maintain resource caps, it has no real sense of depth at this stage in development. The other is that, while in some extents the building is great, it falls flat in the departments of variety and (despite praising it before) complexity. There are all of 5 basic block types, and turrets have an unfortunate tendency to look the same, no matter the size, number of barrels, or parent vessel. And while it's neat to have to attach weapons to your AI's mainframe through 'wiring', said wiring comes in the form of specific connector blocks -- forcing you either to build turret mounts bigger and bulkier than you intended to protect these vulnerable pieces (without which your AI can't fire the weapons), or you leave them exposed to enemy counterbattery.How might these issues be corrected? I'm not even gonna play armchair dev and try to say, definitively, what the fixes might be, but I can offer ideas:1.) Allow research and/or 'backwards-engineering' in the campaign. Lock certain pieces (the 'extra' parts that can be attached to an engine to increase its capabilities, i.e. superchargers) and make it possible to either research their usage or capture the technology when fighting enemies. Ditto for varieties of blocks beyond wood.2.) Turn connector pieces into 'wired blocks', with armor available based on base material just like normal building blocks, and in exchange an escalating price scale.Is From the Depths worth it at this point in the cycle? Well, it depends on whether you really enjoy building stuff. If this is your cup of tea, you can sink hours into the 'game' as it stands at the moment. If you (like me) desire a balance between sandboxing and kicking over the castles in the sandbox a few minutes later, the game is far too underdeveloped at this stage... and anyone looking for an action-packed experience is in for a bit of regret.

								Amazing game, from what i have played i can say that this is one of the most advanced ship/plane/airship/tank/base/spaceship/house/whatever you can come up with builder. You are not in a customize screen where you can swap out maybe 2 or 3 parts, you make literaly every single part of it, want a sniper ship? Done. Want a space lazer? done. Want something no one has come up with yet? Done.In essence this can be considered a perfect game, it is going to be even better since mod support is coming out. All in all, this is a amazing game that will need alot of time to learn. Buy this game if you are willing to commit.			"

								I've played so many fun filled hours with this game.♥♥♥♥♥the game has developed I've seen changes now some things need to be added but for one person( at least to my knolage there is only one dev. correct me if i'm wrong) to do all of this is amazing and the updates have never ""scerwed"" up the game and have only made it better as some games have, and there have been no change in controls and the game is self explanatory and quiter easy to leanr and if not so for you go on Youtube to find many guides and the game has a strong community base and support so i doubt this game can go wrong. All in all this was one if not the best game I've ever bought on steam.I highly recommend this game to any one creative or not as i have to allmy friends and hopefuly there will be a co-op version of the campaign.

								I'm pretty new to Steam, So many people would probobly ignore this review.That out of the way I give Ftd 10/10From the Depths is why I joined the Steam community. (As Nick, The Awesome dev behind this marvel, Moved it to Steam)The Amazing thing about this game is there are HUNDREDS of blocks and modules, each with there respective purpose and resource cost. This makes me willing to spend countless hours creating the most efficient design possible. But Alas, Not one design can be all that. So I'm forced to create many vehicles each with an intended role. I have A bomber, An oil drill ship, A mining and salvage drillship, An anti air patrol craft and most of all my personal fleet of war machines with my signature command battlecruiser.Interestingly enough it is just as fun building the ships as pioleting them as you have to endure trials where you realize ""Oh god noooooooooooooo.......""  if you happened to forget an engine on your tiny attack fighter and ""HOLY SH** THATS AWESOME"" If you were lucky enough to discover a great use for the many components. I often find myself loading up vehicles that were made by other players just to test how well my design would hold up.All in all the main attactivness of the game is theres no one to tell you what to do, Build whatever you wan't It dosn't matter if its not combat effective, The pure graphics and construction alone can inspire great awe. (As The giant chicken somone made did for me)So if you have a spare $20, and a steam account then this game is perfect for youIf you don't have $20 then its still perfect you just need to save up :P			"

								Absolutely fantastic. 10/10. Early access done right.From the Depths, despite its blocky appearance, is a startlingly original game. From the construction features to the customizable combat AI, almost everything in From the Depths is innovative, exciting, and easy to use. In practice, many games in the construction genre tend to fall flat in certain areas. Unlike these, From the Depths is already well optimized, intuitive, and fun. From the Depths construction mechanic is unique, allowing extremely complex ideas to be easily realized. Unlike space engineers and many similar construction games, FTD's construction system is fluid, polished, and robust. Creating complex vehicles such as airships and battleships is easy enough- play the game, familiarize yourself with the mechanics, and boom! There you have it. That's all the experience you need to build something cool in From the Depths. Building something that works really well, however, is more difficult. The good news is, you'll never runout of ideas because From the Depth's extremely in-depth armor and weapons mechanics allow for hundreds of viable strategies.  Hollow armor designed to absorb enemy damage and insulate the core systems? Check. A floating reactor, relying on its powerful shields to rain death from above? Check. A wooden sailboat? Check. Several hundred wooden sailboats? Double check. Combat itself is no less impressive. The AI works surprisingly well out of the box. Because vehicles in From the Depths rely on many individual systems to continue working, combat in From the Depths is always dynamic and interesting. Aircraft usually rely on their speed to outrun danger, casting their lot on large engines and light armor. Landing a hit on an aircraft's jets is often enough to send them into a tailspin. Knock out the engines, and the battle's already won. Target a craft's radar and sensors, and leave a battleship blind. If you're brave enough, it's possible to go one step further and knock out a ship's master AI control. Target the propellers with torpedoes, and leave your enemies paralyzed. The possibilities are quite literally endless. When played In first person, From the Depths can become a fantastic roll-playing game. Ignoring the campaign, From the Depths is a fantastic sandbox. Ignoring the construction, From the Depths is a damn good action-RPG.What I'm trying to get across here is that From the Depths is fun. Like, really fun. Everything works, and the price is right.Do yourself a favor and buy it.			"

								Has taken place as my favourite game. a constantly developing gmae, that you can choose to make complex and clever ships taking days to build or throw together something with nothing more than brute force and ignorance to back it, and you will have tonnes of fun with that ship. this game has taken a fresh new approach to the sandbox games which have been spilling out of Devs for the last couple of years. It's complicated and clever, taking a while to learn and when you've mastered one thing there is a new frontier to explore and learn. its got infinite replayability because of this as even when you have finally built that ship you have dreamed of... you then need to build something bigger better and more ""lasery"" to top it.

								Really great game, for builders AND for those who like large naval/aerial battles that do not require a lot, if any, player input.  If the player wants to, full control of all weapon and movement systems of each craft is easy and the ui is rather easy to learn. Builders will love the wide array of parts and customisability of the weapon and movement systems. Designs can also be easily borrowed from the workshop or the online forum. Designs can be tested easily as all in-game enemy factions' builds are available to spawn in. Detailed info on your vehicles' statistics is easily accessible and very informative.All in all, a very great game for everyone, even for those who don't want to take time off to build their own designs.TL;DR 10/10, DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED			"

								Well what can i say about this game, mmmm not much bad to be honest, dont get me wrong its not 100% perfect but if you like construction games this one is a dam good catch, not just for the price but the content also.The construction on this game has a very good depth to it, from building engines to your own needs to creating your own guns and lasers. i have only really made boats and flyers on this game but loved every minute creating and sinking ships and other strange flying and submersable contraptions. The combat system takes some getting used to, let me try to explain...: basicly you start with a base in campaign mode and a crappy small ship, so you need to get your fleets going asap and consider a base but its the combat you need to understand in this, you build a fleet or in my case in campaign i make just one beast of a ship and start to capture the map (i cant remamber the name of the 1st map but its huge), each zone has a number rateing which determins the strength of the fleet guarding it, you enter the sqaure the fleet spawns in and you battle it out, if you win the number vanishes and you move around the map looking for bases, but be warned if you pass into a sqaure owned by somebody friendly your rateing starts to drop and that side will declare war on you and thats how you try to get around the campaign mode, but you will need wit and stratedgy to survive or in my case really big BIG ships. its when you enter combat it gets strange though, when the fight starts for me my ships so big only 2 or 3 enemy ships will show and the others will be wire frame boxs on standby, when you destroy the ships you see the wire frome boxs turn into ships and start to attack, so for me fleet battles with my beast ships become more like survival mode, at first i will admit i didnt like this system but once i got to grips with it began to love the how the f$&k did my ship survuve that crap holy....., and some bases you just cant hit head on or your fleet/ship will very quickly become large holes. theres numerous ways to conquer campaign mode but how or what you build is up to you completly, make an armada of subs, ships aircraft and even space craft its left to you how to destroy the enemy.the constructer is quite a complex place even with the large number of tutorials and i WARN you here there is a large learning curve so expect to be watching lots of you tube videos to learn how some things work. once you get past the basics before you know it you will be makeing all sorts of crazy ideas and mad weapons, the creators hard but works very well once you learn whats what.over all i have loved this game from the start and would recommend it to any creative mind and construction nut, i havn't tryed story yet im still in campaign lol and developing more machines, but for the money this game is well worth the learning curve, just show it some patience and have you tube and google on stand by lol, any hows good luck if you get this game i hope you enjoy it half as much as i have 10/10.

								""this game made me be the annoying noob in this game forum."" - OrcaTheWhale I mean honestly the game's learning curve almost threw me out of the park, kind of complex at start. I think The only struggle is more on designing vehicles then fighting some. enough about my personal experience with this game, Perfect and a gem of a game. The exploration in the campaign is really vast and big. The limit is none when designing your masterpiece of a machine. Even still I have trouble learning new things.Pros and cons of this game:Pros:gameplay - best part of the game with single and multiplayerbuilding - again, limitlessmap- big and mysterious cons:Learning curve- This is not a  very bad thing but it is steep... tutorials only give you slight informationGraphics - You might expected this game to have high detailed graphics huh? well no you get basic shell shader textures which are kind of plain. However this can be benificial if you have a potato as a computer.sound - kind of boring and buggy.I recommend this game because the atmosphere of this game sucks you in.

That gamble certainly paid off after messing around for a couple hours.From the Depths is by far the best Early Access sandbox game I have played so far. There are tons of features to choose from, and the possibilies are endless. I can see myself spending hours playing this game and still have a good time. This game has TONS of potential to be a really good sandbox game, and I can not wait until the full release of this game. The graphics may not be the greatest thing, and the UI and HUD could use some work too, but I can't say too much because it's still in Early Access.Final Score: 8/10A great sandbox game with tons of potential.

								Like many other people, I initially assumed this was just another minecraft clone when I first saw it. Oh how wrong I was. When I first got it, after viewing a few youtube videos, I tried building my first ship. As you may know from reading the other comments on this game, it's learning curve is more like a cliff, and I started playing before a proper tutorial system had been implemented. So, my first ship barely floated. Not wanting to give up, I removed its weapons, and reverse engineered another ship I had seen on youtube to get it to work. Finally, after about 3 days of experimenting, I finally got I working, and watched as it destroyed just about everything the starting faction could throw at it. I still use that ship in my campiagns, hours of tweaking, testing and modifing mean its one of the most cost effective vehicles I have, and I have built dozens of variants.From The Depths has become my favorite game by far, and even after hundreds of hours, I am still finding new things to do, from submarines to spaceships, and has a very dedicated team of developers, who are seemingly always working on one thing or another. It does have a few shortfalls, such as its fairly basic sound effects, but all together it is a very good game, and is only going to get better.			"

								FtD is simply amazing.  It blends Minecraft with EvE with Robocraft and gives you the freedom to build like very few wannabe ""sandbox"" games actually deliver on.  Planes, boats, subs, spacecraft...all wrapped up with a good physics engine and in Voxel style.All this comes with a price - it makes Dwarf Fortress's learning curve look like an ice skating rink and will obliterate your computer's processing power even on a top gaming rig (at highest settings).However, if you are willing to put in the time (and have the hardware), I'm sure you could spend literally thousands of hours on this - and that's just it's state now in Alpha.  An early access that, for once, is worth more than the price tag...and by a huge margin!			"

								This game is the sheer definition of the term ""Just 5 more minutes"" I may not have many hours into this game but from what I can tell so far it has a LOT going for it. It has quite of a learning curve to master with alot of things but that's the fun thing about this game. It challenges you to evolve and adapt because I will tell you from experience enemies will get harder and its the most infuriating thing losing a ship because of a simple armor flaw. This game has made me smile, and made me wanna throw my keyboard out the window.PROS:+Boat physics+Very rewarding gameplay+CANNONS OUT THE WAZOO+Many different types of weaponsto dispatch your foes+Never stops challenging you to do bigger and better+VERY ADDICTINGCONS:-Learning curve can be abit much if your not willing toput the time in and learn-Ship balancing can be a tad annoying sometimes if you don't knowwtf your doing-It will eat your life, your dog, your family, it will consume everything you'veever loved in life and make you it's ♥♥♥♥♥. (It's addicting as hell.)CONCLUSION:              This game is the single thing that allows me to express my love for battleships and naval power in that regard.If you like building ships and being able to control every little thing about how a ship behaves, build cannons that fityour specific needs, or wanna have fun building a metal box armed with frag missiles, PLEASE BUY THIS GAME. 9/10			"

								Great game, thats how early access should look like!!!There is only one developer but i still didnt encounter a single bug in over 50 hours playing!!!There are hundrets of blocks, you can create turrents, AI, Planes, Submarines, Ships, Blimps and even Spacecraft!!!Also the developer is very active and comunicates through the game's forum, great guy!The performance is very good considering how much has to be calculated in such a game(3d block creation)!Also the whole building system is very very good, there is mirror mode, you can create prefabs and other helpful stuff.10/10, best early access game i encountered yet!!!

								FtD is simply amazing.  It blends Minecraft with EvE with Robocraft and gives you the freedom to build like very few wannabe ""sandbox"" games actually deliver on.  Planes, boats, subs, spacecraft...all wrapped up with a good physics engine and in Voxel style.All this comes with a price - it makes Dwarf Fortress's learning curve look like an ice skating rink and will obliterate your computer's processing power even on a top gaming rig (at highest settings).However, if you are willing to put in the time (and have the hardware), I'm sure you could spend literally thousands of hours on this - and that's just it's state now in Alpha.  An early access that, for once, is worth more than the price tag...and by a huge margin!			"

								First, let me get this out of the way:The tutorials work, but they're ATROCIOUS.Quizzes?? I hate how if you get an answer wrong, like a real first-timer would, you miss out on experience. Also, quizzes! In a game! The tutorials that show you how systems work by building the model are alright but the camera control sucks in that too, try and look around AND click next.. you'll end up losing your view every time. Aside from those the game is unlike any other in the level of customizing and systems that can all work together! I love how I can do all this stuff.			"

								This game is awesome. I don't think there is any other game out there where you can design a cannon that can punch through the armour of a warship, then add a fuze that makes the shell explode inside the target ship for lots of damage, then mount that cannon on a turret on an airship, aircraft, or just a regular old cruiser. Then design a gatling gun to take out aircraft, build a laser system to shoot down incoming missiles, and then switch gears and build a submarine that launches torpedos loaded with EMP charges that zap through metal armour to take out the electronics controlling turrets and weapons, or the ship itself.The best part is that everything is built out of blocks that interact with each other so that the effect of the damage on subsystems can be interesting as well e.g. if an explosion takes out a chunk of your engine, the effect varies whether it manages to break the crankshaft in two, takes out exhaust piping, etc.This game requires a lot of patience though, the learning curve is steep. My very first ship would flip over the moment it hit the water. That said if you like building and designing it is well worth it. 233 hours in and still having a lot of fun with this game. I think that stands for itself.P.S. There are some really useful guides on the various systems in the game on the official forum, I suggest taking a look once you've gotten your feet wet. Looking at designs there was a great way to get inspiration for hull shapes and weapon systems as well. Also, if you're like me, I suggest looking at some of the engine collections on the Steam workshop, there are some well made and optimized engines e.g. KuramaFox's unified engine raft. I like to pick a pre-made design that suits my needs (high-efficiency, high-power, or small size?) for my ships on so I can focus on other things, like fine tuning cannons or designing torpedoes or a laser system. OTOH you might find that you enjoy building and tuning engines ...there's a lot of content in this game.Lastly, it helps to start small. Try building small boats and airships and work your way up from there.			"

Early Access Review
								My take on From the Depths	First, allow me to come out and say this, the developers of this game are on the verge of something big in my opinion. This game is truly special in three ways.1. It balances the complexity with the playability.	This is probably the thing I love most about this game. Nothing is all in one piece. Everything from canons, to engines, to AIs must be built by the player, and can be built in any way that the player sees fit. However, at the same time the game is very comprehensive. At first the player may get completely lost in the complexity, but the wide range of tutorials allows for a quick understanding of the games mechanics, and allows the player to get in the game rather quickly.2. It merges sandbox gameplay with strategic gameplay.	This game feels as though it is a cross between Minecraft and Command and Conquer. You command the vehicles that you built, and with eight different factions to fight, your strategies and vehicles change constantly to combat your foes strengths, and exploit their weaknesses. Everything you do or build is a strategic choice, which is what primarily makes this game so unique.3. There is plenty of room for creativity.	Although the game is widely based on strategy, the block-based building allows for an infinite amount of possibilities as to what the player can create. There are nearly no restrictions on what you can or can’t build...so go ahead, build that flying unicorn you’ve always dreamed of!	With qualities like these, the game is bound for greatness. If you (the developers) can maintain these three key traits, then you will likely create an extremely successful game.			"

								I don't like long reviews, so I'm going to keep it nice, short, and simple:Pros-1) Fun; I love to build a random ship and just sail around islands with it.2) Ultimate customization; You can customize almost anything in this game.3) Multiplayer; Very fun to have battles with your friends in Montana-class battleships.4) Vehicles; From ships to planes, tanks and more, you can build just about anything that gets you moving or you take for shelter.Cons-1) Graphics; It's in Alpha, so there will of course be better graphics soon.2) Visible character in first person; This one is a really small one, just annoying. I put it here so it's just not one con for the game.Over all, I give this game a 9/10 because it is just what I want from a game about building things.			"

								Very intriguing so far.Unlike most games nowadays, you actually have to learn how to play this game before actually playing it. Luckily, there's a wealth of in-game resources to teach you, including: step-by-step demos, in-game tutorial sessions, and quizzes after each section. Yup. Quizzes. You get EXP for getting questions right.And that's all justified, because FtD is a very complicated and deep game that gives you a ton of flexible tools to play with. Far more difficult to learn than anything like Space Engineers, so if that was too cerebral for you--avoid FtD.I'm still doing tutorials and learning how to play at the time of writing this (5hrs), and I'll write more as I go.EDIT: I still really don't understand how to 'play' the game. Still recommending, just go into it knowing that it's got a very steep learning curve. 2 steep 4 me.			"

								In short great idea for a game advanced block building and for those with patience and understand that things can get complex.First I will say about this game is that it is still in Alpha and you are looking at early access. This means there are bugs and not polished. But the gameplay is there and it does work.The game is regualrly updated and the Dev is responsive to players comments and issues as long as he knows there is an issue.The biggest tip I could give anyone is get on the officail forums and you will find a community willing to help and responsive to any issues you may have. If you don't tell anyone about tyour problems don't moan when they don't get fixed for you.Overall the building of ships with a physics implementation is a great idea and means that some very complex designs can be built by players. Then being able to pit that design against other peoples or the game created design makes you feel fabulous when your designs win.Checkout the varoious youtube videos on this game for tutorials and helpful hints.My own Video review of this game is below.

If you have a good enough PC and you like building your own RTS vehicles and use them against the enemy, then this game is perfect for you. "

								Fantastic game. Very difficult to get out of my head during the day. I always think up new designs that inevitably fail, but when I finally figure out exactly what I want to do, I am given absolute freedom to create it. This game is a creative person's dream, you can design literally anything and make it fight. Gameplay aside, this developer is the best developer I have ever seen in regards to community response and vision. He has created a fantastic world and is very responsive to the community. The forums are very active and seeing the crazy stuff they build gives me amazing inspiration. I've spent more time on the forums and steam workshop than I have on the actual game.			"

								Complex and awesome.This one is a treat for anyone who likes to sink endless hours into creating and improving all kinds of vehicles. I've already spent more than 60 hours in the editor, had tremendous fun and didn't even start the campaign yet. I guess it will be quite difficult to balance game conent properly as there are so many degrees of freedom but the game would worth it if there was just a sandbox mode. With so many possibilities there comes a learning curve, but it's never overwhelming and more a 'hard to master' thing. The basic features can be learned quickly and it's quite satisfying to get your first vehicles working properly. The interface and tools are quite well thought out; even huge vehicles can be edited quite comfortably thanks to things like prefabricated parts, mirrors and flood fill. Performance is quite alright even on an older rig and i managed to crash the game only once.Already one of my all-time-favourites (in more than 25 years of gaming) - definitely recommended for anyone into this sort of game!

								Let me level with you. This game has a learning curve, and a somewhat steep one. But if you're like me and you're never happy with your somehow-floating-somehow-able-to-survive-metal-rectangles you'll eventually feel on top of the world, like the campaign of Neter and it's sprawling seas have nothing that could match you. You'll build magnificent, beautiful war machines that are equal parts art and lethal design. You'll tweak your ships thousands of times and go through hundreds of iterations until you feel like you can stop and move on to the next one, and you'll spend days on that one too. Then an update will come out, and you have to rebuild your whole 20+ ship fleet and restart your 30+ hour campaign file.10/10 Nick, I love you.			"

								Dont normally write reviews, this game deserves it. Hours in game speaks for itself.  Currently 322 hours in-game, which is more than 95% of the games in my library. I think I bought this gaen for full price at 19.99 but it is currently on sale for like $4 or something. At $4 that means $1 for 80 hours of entertainment.Simple math says I have really gotten my moneys worth, and its true. One of the most fun games I think I have ever played. I have at least 100 games in my library I paid $40+ for and didnt play for more than 20 hrs.If you have an OCD personality that loves to figure out how complicated systems work, this game will entertain you for weeks.For the amount of money this game costs, there is incredible depth to the game system design that most games do not approach including games with tens of millions of dollars of development budget.This is made by a small indie developer that deserves and has earned my patronage, and imo deserves yours as well.Pros:*Vehicle design lab lets you build and test your designs against a library of enemies I have collected so I can see how various defensive/offensive systems work*Very complex weapon systems that allow you to fine tune almost any aspect of behavior*Layers of offensive and defensive systems, not every weapon works in every situation and likewise not every defensive system will save you from every weapon*Physics based so if you are building a ship, sub, aircraft or spacecraft you have to balance your mass, deal with drag surfaces, pitch, roll, and yaw, and figure out how to balance power requirements, propulsion, and attitude thrust*Some cool sci-fi ish things like lasers, ion cannon, warp drives, rail guns*Customizeable AI behaviors so you can turn them on or off to suit your needs, make a few drones and set them on auto while you manage your feel or build something new*Supply resources that can be set in global or local mode - you can choose if you want to make your game harder by have resources localized so you cant just insta build a huge asset far from your supply lines without bringing those supplies there - you have to protect your supply assets*Watching 60 VLS missles, cannons, lasers, and all manner of weaponry firing simultaneously is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic*Much moreCons:*Small team so development takes time, I personally think with more resources this game, which is already worth far more than is being charged for it, could be truly amazing*Multiplayer is limited to a few people where one person hosts the server and is pretty jankyu right now in campaign mode, lots of save corruption and at times the players get de-synched from the server and really wierd♥♥♥♥♥♥happens - if these guys can fix the multiplayer though omg badass "

								Recently bought this game with no real expectations and I must admit I am pleasantly surprised. Its always a gamble buying an Early Access Game but the developer on this seems to be very active and working productively with the community to make a polished game, you can see a constantly stream of updates on the official forums (not the steam forums).As with any Early Access the game has a few nitty gritty bugs, but nothing game breaking and certainly nothing to take away the enjoyment of the game. Multiplayer already works fantastic already at this stage and is most enjoyable when playing with friends.There is a multiplayer campaign which is rather fun, however the ""battle screen"" and how the game enters battles is a tad annoying at the moment, but I think this might just be a personal pet peave rather.Overall the game offers hours of enjoyment and has great potential, coupled with an active developer I think this is definitely worth recommending. It combines being a strategy game with build a sandbox builder, and it works remarkably well. Score: 8/10			"

								This game is like the Dwarf Fortress of battleship sims. It'll take you at least a good 10 hours to wrap your head around the physics, ship design, weapon design, shell and missile design, etc, but it'll feel so good to watch or pilot your creation as it goes toe to toe with those who would destroy you. From the Depths is a creative and complex game unlike any other and I can't praise it enough. I've spent thirty hours tinkering with weapons and fiddling with a single ship design of my own and there's still so much more to learn. By this time with most games I'm looking to uninstall, but From the Depths is going to rack up hundreds or maybe thousands of hours for me. Buy this game.			"

Build a boat/ship, a base, a hellicopter, a plane, or a combo of the 4. there really is not much of a limmit to what you can build in this game not even the sky is a limmit you can go to space (kind of)  and the AI verry well put together as well. the game is always being updated and the Dev is active in letting us know whats next and takes suggestions.ok with out rambling on any more let me just say this i have NEVER found a game that i was willing let alone wanting to put over 400 hours in to and im not slowing down now.

								Day 1: Having troubles making my wooden boat float.Day something after that: Having troubles making my metal submarine not float.Tbh its a pretty fun game, but it can be confusing at times. Overall i give it a 9/10. The physics engine is great, but it can be a bit... Weird.... at times. Like i said, building can be confusing at times. But what I don't like is that you have to unlock certain parts by doing campaign missions. But that isn't exactly a bad thing. It allows you to expand your creativity by making a working ship! Its a great game to play with friends, and blow up ships by planting ammo barrels on the deck of the ship.Or make the entire ship out of ammo barrels.That works too.Im not lying. I got with some friends and we put ammo barrels on the deck of a ship. And then we blew it up with missiles. It was fun.Also this game isn't for casual players who want to just clap their hands and a ship suddenly appears. You need to put effort and time into your ship if you want it to be good. Or you could just always load a pre-built ship....			"

								Fantastic game. Very difficult to get out of my head during the day. I always think up new designs that inevitably fail, but when I finally figure out exactly what I want to do, I am given absolute freedom to create it. This game is a creative person's dream, you can design literally anything and make it fight. Gameplay aside, this developer is the best developer I have ever seen in regards to community response and vision. He has created a fantastic world and is very responsive to the community. The forums are very active and seeing the crazy stuff they build gives me amazing inspiration. I've spent more time on the forums and steam workshop than I have on the actual game.			"

You can then use your crafts to conquer the planet, fighting many different enemies with their own fighting styles. Gameplay is close to and strategy, escpecially RTS with action and vehicular elements aswell(as you can drive and use your vehicles yourdelf if you want)Pros:Unique gameplayHighly customizable all the way to the weapons(pretty much Space Engineers but the focus id in fighting crafts)Challenging and fun campaingDifferent scenarios for your tasteFreedom of choiceCons:Can be difficult to startBuggy time to timeMultiplayer not polishedCan be demanding for your PCCampaing can be hardOverall this game is great and has alot of potential. If you have a good enough PC and you like building your own RTS vehicles and use them against the enemy, then this game is perfect for you. "

								So today I thought that I would write another review, and I thought I would do it on a game that I recently have really quite enjoyed, From The Depths. This game is for sure complex when first starting out on it and it has a large learning curve, but once it is mastered, it is a hella lot of fun. Basics of it is building your own vehicle, such as a boat, airship, plane, submarine, almost anything you want and then it gets raided by AI armies. Another great feature is that you can build your own cannons/turrets and customize them however you want. You can make it deal massive amounts of damage or have a crazy firing speed. It is so amazing how you can create such a variety of things from just a single block. I 100% recommend this game to those with a creative mind and are looking for loads of fun!---EDITED: PLEASE FIX ALL THE BUGS IT IS DRIVNG ME INSANE			"

								In short great idea for a game advanced block building and for those with patience and understand that things can get complex.First I will say about this game is that it is still in Alpha and you are looking at early access. This means there are bugs and not polished. But the gameplay is there and it does work.The game is regualrly updated and the Dev is responsive to players comments and issues as long as he knows there is an issue.The biggest tip I could give anyone is get on the officail forums and you will find a community willing to help and responsive to any issues you may have. If you don't tell anyone about tyour problems don't moan when they don't get fixed for you.Overall the building of ships with a physics implementation is a great idea and means that some very complex designs can be built by players. Then being able to pit that design against other peoples or the game created design makes you feel fabulous when your designs win.Checkout the varoious youtube videos on this game for tutorials and helpful hints.My own Video review of this game is below.

								Dont normally write reviews, this game deserves it. Hours in game speaks for itself.  Currently 322 hours in-game, which is more than 95% of the games in my library. I think I bought this gaen for full price at 19.99 but it is currently on sale for like $4 or something. At $4 that means $1 for 80 hours of entertainment.Simple math says I have really gotten my moneys worth, and its true. One of the most fun games I think I have ever played. I have at least 100 games in my library I paid $40+ for and didnt play for more than 20 hrs.If you have an OCD personality that loves to figure out how complicated systems work, this game will entertain you for weeks.For the amount of money this game costs, there is incredible depth to the game system design that most games do not approach including games with tens of millions of dollars of development budget.This is made by a small indie developer that deserves and has earned my patronage, and imo deserves yours as well.Pros:*Vehicle design lab lets you build and test your designs against a library of enemies I have collected so I can see how various defensive/offensive systems work*Very complex weapon systems that allow you to fine tune almost any aspect of behavior*Layers of offensive and defensive systems, not every weapon works in every situation and likewise not every defensive system will save you from every weapon*Physics based so if you are building a ship, sub, aircraft or spacecraft you have to balance your mass, deal with drag surfaces, pitch, roll, and yaw, and figure out how to balance power requirements, propulsion, and attitude thrust*Some cool sci-fi ish things like lasers, ion cannon, warp drives, rail guns*Customizeable AI behaviors so you can turn them on or off to suit your needs, make a few drones and set them on auto while you manage your feel or build something new*Supply resources that can be set in global or local mode - you can choose if you want to make your game harder by have resources localized so you cant just insta build a huge asset far from your supply lines without bringing those supplies there - you have to protect your supply assets*Watching 60 VLS missles, cannons, lasers, and all manner of weaponry firing simultaneously is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic*Much moreCons:*Small team so development takes time, I personally think with more resources this game, which is already worth far more than is being charged for it, could be truly amazing*Multiplayer is limited to a few people where one person hosts the server and is pretty jankyu right now in campaign mode, lots of save corruption and at times the players get de-synched from the server and really wierd♥♥♥♥♥♥happens - if these guys can fix the multiplayer though omg badass "

								Let me level with you. This game has a learning curve, and a somewhat steep one. But if you're like me and you're never happy with your somehow-floating-somehow-able-to-survive-metal-rectangles you'll eventually feel on top of the world, like the campaign of Neter and it's sprawling seas have nothing that could match you. You'll build magnificent, beautiful war machines that are equal parts art and lethal design. You'll tweak your ships thousands of times and go through hundreds of iterations until you feel like you can stop and move on to the next one, and you'll spend days on that one too. Then an update will come out, and you have to rebuild your whole 20+ ship fleet and restart your 30+ hour campaign file.10/10 Nick, I love you.			"

You will have to spend quite a few hours figuring out how to design soemthing halfway decent and dozens of hours to finally be able to make amazing designs (that blast everything out of the water and skys at an insane resource efficieny).

								Started off by watching a bunch of tutorials online, which helped immensely in the long run, and started making random crap, just to mess around.  Then I started the campaign, and I had no idea what I was doing, so I started spawning in several planes to make an Air Force, which then failed me miserably.  I then decided to make ships that could carry way too many resources than necessary, and had missiles and AA guns on it only, and that was my main battleship for the longest time.  I appropriately named it the Scavenger, and moved on to make another air fleet, consisting of several vintage WWII aircraft.After a long and decisive battle with a Deepwater Guard Airship, I ended up losing all my planes, and I had to retreat to my slow♥♥♥♥♥Scavenger, which I was attempting to transport to the Warzone.  At the time, I never undershoot what it meant to pull all my forces out of play, so I would idiotically wait onboard the scavenger, till it finally reached the Gantry I had captured in the previous battle, and there the airship flew, too high for me to hijack, which was my tactic for the longest time, and still is.  After accumulating more air forces and retrofitting P-51s with laser guided missiles, I engaged the airship.After what seemed like a few minutes, the airship fell to the ocean, and I hijacked it and destroyed every last component on the damn airship.  I scrapped the ship and used the reassures to make a tall spotting tower, which aided me in discovering where I actually was on the map.After numerous engagements, I set my sight on what I thought was a military land installation, and I attacked with everything I had.  Long story short, I lost almost all my P-51s (which all crashed into the ground on their own, because I assume the AIs got drunk) to find out it was just a fishing village.  Go figure.After many more days of planning and attacking, I finally beat the Deepwater Guard (after making a carrier and War Ship), and decided to make the best and safest headquarters for my nation.  It took me forever, but I was satisfyingly awesome to walk around the halls of my very own Capitol in the end, with the flags of my nation flying proudly overhead,Long story short, this game has almost infinite possibilities when it comes to just doing whatever the hell you want.  I haven't even scratched the surface of it all yet, and it's exciting to figure out how to make new things, like lasers (which I actually don't know how to make yet), or even CRAM Cannons (Because Advanced Cannons are life).  I would definitely recommend this to anyone willing to learn how to play it, because it does have a huge learning curve, but that's not entirely bad, in fact, it's pretty much a part of life.  So consider this game to be a fun, yet important life lesson.I would play this for as long as I could, if life altogether would allow me to.			"

								The fact that it is a very flexible sandbox is what gets me. Even though it has blocks (no circles for the charm of it), it is still a creative way for designers, hobbyists, and engineers to indulge in their imagnation. Nothing stops you from designing a submarine, ship, building, land vehicle, aircraft, or even spacecraft. It literally lets you free from the strict limits of the real world (except physics of course). That's why this $20 dollar game is a bargain.			"

								Absolutely fantastic game. Nothing bad to say about it except that it needs some optimisations, as it can get very laggy very quickly, especially with very large battles (I'm looking at you, Onyx Watch trade fleets). But otherwise it is completely amazing, in every respect: excellent sandbox play where you really can build whatever the hell you want and the best part is that it actually matters what you build - you need to pay real attention to aero- and hydro-dynamics, center of mass, center of thrust, buoyancy, weight, size, and so forth before even beginning with the weapons aspect. This may make it sound boring but trust me, the building system is utterly engrossing and before you know it hours upon hours of your time will have been spent making something that turns out to work spectacularly badly. And you'll keep coming back for more, because when the program you wrote in-game fires the missiles that you built and designed in game from the launcher that you designed (mounted on the ship that you built), and guides them perfectly into the ammunition storage of an enemy jet streaking overhead... it's so very very worth it.TL;DR: BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT			"

But, if you actually give the damn thing a chance, you'll be glad you did. Most of the negative reviews are people who played the game for less than an hour and said they couldn't figure out how the game worked, or they didn't like the UI so they gave up. UI is odd, yes, but again, you get used to it, and it works in the end. It's not a bad game because you can't figure out how it works.			"

EDIT: new story for a marauder I was.... improving.So I wanted to use it as a cargo ship, but it was too slow.Solution: strap around 25 ion thrusters to itBut it wasn't going fast enough, despite the sheer number of thrustersso I noticed the ship didn't have strong enough engines to power all those things.I figured since it was so slow, just leave the throtle on while I worked, and so I go to town, making a really strong engine.

								Professional tip: Always watch videos on a game before getting into it. Especially this one.From the Depths is a hard target indeed. Takes a lot of experimentation, trial and error. But as many people before me have already said, once that's all done and through, you will truly know what it means to be the architect of a nation's destruction.Fair warning, even after all this there's still a strange control scheme unique to this game which takes a while to get used to. Plus there's always the risk of framerate drops. If you're worried about whether this will run on your machine, it's probably best to wait for a full release. Even if you're not, it's likely a good idea to wait anyway because changes come thick and fast for the most part, and you probably don't want the irritation of having to get a refund because the game doesn't start for x reason.Still brave enough to have a go? Then sally forth, and let the gun porn rain down upon your face.			"

								Now, while this game has its hangups, it's improving rapidly (for an early access game) and I heartily recommend it. my advice is to steal ships at first, reverse engineer them, give up and make a fortress with a giant ♥♥♥♥ off gun on it. EDIT: new story for a marauder I was.... improving.So I wanted to use it as a cargo ship, but it was too slow.Solution: strap around 25 ion thrusters to itBut it wasn't going fast enough, despite the sheer number of thrustersso I noticed the ship didn't have strong enough engines to power all those things.I figured since it was so slow, just leave the throtle on while I worked, and so I go to town, making a really strong engine. I finish and look up.....and I'm about half way to orbit, upside down.Accidental Kerbal space program/10			"

								This game is really leaps and bounds ahead of its competetors, and has some great potential, but there are a few issues...6.5/10Pros:-Fantasticly fun battles-Very 'free' style, build whatever you want-Excellent price point-Good variety of different parts-Great community-Finishing a build that works is very satisfying -Dedicated developersCons:-Poor performance (This is mainly because of how ahead of its time the game is)-Ugly texture and UI-Very few options-Hard to learn, much much harder to master-Poor tutorials-Has a very 'dated' feel to it, possibly because of the aesthetic style-Becomes frustrating quickly, and with such a small player base, finding solutions isnrt always easy "

								Steps to die by your own ship's turretsStep 1: Build a giant ship with two 456mm double barreled guns at the frontStep 2: Spawn an enemy in vehicle designerStep 3: Realise it spawned behind your shipStep 4: Not realise that there is enough space between each cannon for them to hit each other while firingStep 5: Panic as the front gun shoots your second gun in the backStep 6: Watch poorly placed ammo boxes tear your ship in half like the titanicStep 7: Cry at yourself in embarrassmentStep 8: Uninstall Butt UU really this game is absolutely amazing even though it isn't complete...

								This game has an awesome amount of freedom and fidelity with every build. You want to build a to-scale Bismark? Go ahead. How about a Man of War from the age of sail, but with a massive two-tone laser? Why not? Apache Attack Helicopter? Check. A massive airship, the likes of which the world has never seen, that remains aloft using hundreds of thrusters? Yep. Now tanks, racecars, and mobile bunkers are a reality as well.The fact that this game is still in alpha blows my mind. The idea that there will continue to be more and more content added to this already wonderfully deep and complex game is fantastic.Don't let the complexity put you off. Building a raft bristling with homing missles, for example, is quite simple and effective. And who doesn't like to obliterate their foes with swarms of missiles streaking through the sky?			"

								Updating this review...Pros:- Player feedback is asked for and listened to- They're adding player mods that are deemed good into the game, accelerating the development by letting YOU participate in it.- Customizability^4- Actively developed - Coop / vs with people you invite- Great tutorialsCons: Some graphics things:- No graphic transitions between land, water and vehicles. You know... Eye candy that pretends to be physics.- Inventory is just text, no fancy images (icons)- I'd like to see some permanent effects on the terrain if/when I crash a flying fortress into it. (EDIT: Turns out the code for terrain damage already exists, but it's turned off. Dev response was about new components taking priority. Can't blame.).Don't get scared off by ""hard to learn"" reviews. Your in-game failures don't make you angry because there are no serious consequences. And if you DO get angry, you get to know the reason and the solution for it. There's no grinding for days to get what you want. Your progress is not limited by the hours you put into the game. This also means that if you don't progress at all, the game won't punish you. For example, I went into designer mode, built my boat, spawned some enemy ships, got obliterated in seconds, sunk my character to the bottom of the sea and spawned some planes and submarines of a third fraction to destroy the one that killed my ship. I could respawn my ship at any time but I enjoyed watching their combat with camera detached from my character! There are A LOT of other designs you can watch do battle. Or spawn them as your own and reverse-engineer some things :DYou can also go and do different story missions and scenarios. You can set the difficulty EXACTLY the way you want it. Ever bothered you that enemies on ""hard"" do more damage than you with the same weapons? You can tone that down or even turn the odds in your favor. You think that salvaging enemies is unfair? Make vehicles worth less or no resources when destroyed. Etc.The game is Alpha. Might get more expensive upon release. It doesn't have a demo version so I waited for it to come on a big discount. Bought it on 80% off and I have a great time with it. Worth the full price. Might buy it again if I convince a friend to play it someday.			"

								This game is PHENOMINAL, I get on it once a week or more if i have an idea to build. In this game you can build ships, oil rigs, island bases, aircraft, and submarines, atleast so far you can but i dont know what the devs are planning on doing with it.

There are no limits on what you can build in this game, it's kind of like minecraft except that you can sail the boats you make. Now, after getting the good things out of the way, let us discuss the bad, this game requires a marginally good pc to run some of the big builds, so one of my friends i got the game for could not play so I was slightly saddened. The ai in this game is kind of hard to make function or atleast, thats my experience. That is my review on this amazing game and i hope to continue playing for many many hours.			"

								Professional tip: Always watch videos on a game before getting into it. Especially this one.From the Depths is a hard target indeed. Takes a lot of experimentation, trial and error. But as many people before me have already said, once that's all done and through, you will truly know what it means to be the architect of a nation's destruction.Fair warning, even after all this there's still a strange control scheme unique to this game which takes a while to get used to. Plus there's always the risk of framerate drops. If you're worried about whether this will run on your machine, it's probably best to wait for a full release. Even if you're not, it's likely a good idea to wait anyway because changes come thick and fast for the most part, and you probably don't want the irritation of having to get a refund because the game doesn't start for x reason.Still brave enough to have a go? Then sally forth, and let the gun porn rain down upon your face.			"

								It's pretty hard to really 'review' this early access game.  I'll be honest with you, IMO this game seems like it's one of those that will just never -not- be early access.  But what is here in this game so far is simply fantastic.  I almost missed it, too.  One of my friends introduced this game to me.  At first, even then, I kind of just dismissed it.  I played a little and was kind of intimidated.  Almost a full year later, I tried again, and stuck with it.  Watched some Youtube videos and learned a lot.  Now it's one of my favorite games.There's really no other game like this on the market for now.  I guess it's more akin to something like Robocraft than anything else, just not as a lobby-based multiplayer game.  Oh, and there's a lot of water in this game.  Like, a lot.  Hence, the title.From the Depths isn't easy to get into.  Luckily, the developer's recently added a bit of a tutorial system that goes over a lot fo the mechanics in the game to help get you started.  There are a few Youtubers that have guides and walkthroughs as well.  If you're interested, I recommend looking up IreLAN Gaming's Youtube channel, there are a bunch of videos by him that explains a lot and does some interesting builds.Let me give an example of the complexity of this game for you.Take a metal block, add a propeller to it.  Doesn't work.  Propeller needs power.  Build an engine.  Oh wait...  that involves placing an engine block, placing crankshaft parts, putting pistons on the crankshaft.  That'll work and give you power, but you can get even more power by adding fuel injectors, or adding carburetors and slapping superchargers or turbochargers on 'em.  Don't forget to pipe the exhaust out to cool it all, if it gets too hot it'll lose effeciency at high loads and eventually stop working if it overheats.  There are radiators you can slap on, too.The engine isn't working?  Oh yeah, you'll need fuel.  Don't have fuel?  Have to get some oil.  Make a refinery to turn it into fuel.So!  Now we have an engine, with fuel, which is now powering the propeller.  But the metal block isn't very hydrodynamic, is it?  Turn that thing into an actual boat, because water and air resistance is a thing in this game.  Sloped and angled building materials are very important to minimize resistance in order to maximize speed.  Now the boat's top heavy and keeps flipping, so add a keel.  Now, to turn the boat you need a rudder.  Boat's getting a little heavy, add some more propellers.  Hell, add some wings to the ship, equip some jet thrusters to the back, and turn it into an airplane.  Hell, put some ion thrusters on various parts of the ship and now you can fly it into space and use it a a satellite or space ship.Seal up the hull, add some airpumps, use PID controller blocks to set the ship's AI to keep it at a certain level in the water, keep it from rolling or listing too much, and turn it into a submarine.  Add some wheels, drive it on land, call it a tank.Oh, wait, we haven't got into weapons or AI.  Well, this ""review"" is getting long enough as it is...The sheer 'Depth' of this game is fantastic.  It's easy to get into, mess around, and just keep building and building.  My first ship was a massive, terrible Frankenstein's monster of a ship that could hardly float.  My more recent ships have been sleek, fast, well armored, and pack a punch.  The iterative design is awesome.The game's being developed by a very small team, and there's really only one programmer working on it.  The love for the game is obvious, and he's always adding more to the game while improving what's already there.  The game is far from perfect, and the larger battles will slow down even powerful machines becuase of the sheer volume of what's being constantly calculated.  The game has some rough edges, and like I said before the UI is pretty rough, but it is getting better.  The game obviously isn't for everyone, it's very focused on the combat.Definitely worth the price, IMO.  Especially if it goes on sale.  Like now.  Steam Summer Sale.  Get it. $6.00.  Game's a steal for that much.P.S. From the Depths does have multiplayer.  It's not as stable as singleplayer, but it's nice to have.			"

Early Access Review
								I've spent over 300 hours in the first month after the purchase, so it's avery good investment for the given entertainment.I'll begin with the cons:- Beware for your social life...- This game is in no way finished, and considering that it's a one man work, it will continue to evolve for years.But, there are rumours of modding support that's coming in, and with the actual community I'm sure that will accelerate the development drastically.- The game is laggy with huge creations or when there are too many missiles, and I honestly don't think that will improve a lot, it's a simple matter of ""people always want more"", so if the game is optimized, people will make bigger creations and launch more missiles.- The game is complex and without the help of the forums and youtube tutorials it is not even possible to know where or how to begin.- I mean, the game is really complex, you've been warned...So, why did I spent over 300 hours in a month on this game?- After the first 15-20 hours, things begin to fall in and you understand the most important mechanisms.- I'm a builder, and this game is about building.- I like to have the possibility to create complex things, and this game is just that, you want to add a cannon? You have to build the cannon piece by piece, trying to find the balance you need for this specific cannon and this specific ship and I love it!- You can automate some actions/reactions (not enough for now, but the game is expanding month after month...).- I love ships.- I love submarines even more (and I did not even began to build one!!! I want it to be perfect so I continue to learn how to make better ships...).- The creator is dedicated to his work and he is very present on the forum (10.55 posts per day from him on the forum, and all that while working hard on the game).- The potential of this game is HUGE. So many things can be added that I know I will be disapointed because everything that is in my mind will not be included in the game (but with mod support... who knows...). Anyway you can only be disapointed by something you like, else you don't even care, and I definitly like this game.The point is, if you like legos, building war machine, destroying war machines or watching huge explosions and bits of vehicules falling appart, then why are you still reading this?? Buy the game, and play.Thanks to Nick Smart, the author of this game, you're wonderful!! "

								While this game may be very frustrating at times and is kinda hard to learn, it is worth it when you make your first working plane, laser, cannon, whatever. It has ridiculous customization, so you could if you wanted to, have a giant boat that looks like a sheep fighting a submarine that looks like pikatchu that spawns miniature goat subs.The campaigns people make can provide a challenge, too. Don't get too mad if it crashes... it does that alot.From the Depths has a very friendly community. In all the time I've been on the forums, very few arguments really arose... and most of them were really stupid. They will usually help out with a problem that you have... unless they really can't figure what you did.This may sound like me rambling on, but don't just sit there, questioning your life, and if you should buy the game. Do what Shia Labeouf would want, ""Just Do It!""    Not sorry at all.It is a really rewarding game if you can be patient and can learn. (There are people who just hate this game to hate it. Seriously, look past the flaws. There aren't many developers for this game. If I remember correctly, some of the community members work on the game too.)This is getting a little long... well, boohoo. Just try the game out, it's really fun, as I've said like 10 times already. (A little exagerated on the number, but I really mean that you should get the game, person reading this review.)(P.S. My FTD Forum name is HerobrineofNotch. I'm not the kind of person who goes on everyday, even if I was, I wouldn't have the time.)Bye!			"

								From the Depths is perfect for people who want to build and test things for their own reasons and a lot less perfect for people who want a game with a clear objective or progression system.Nothing new here for a sandbox game; people complaining that there isn't anything to do, just because they didn't go LOOKING for something to do, forgot to take a look at the tags under the description of the game. If you DO go looking for things to do, you'll find that there are, in fact, meaningful things to do with your creations, such as:- Entering them into a tournament;- Playing through the campaign using them;- Playing through the story missions using them;- Creating a custom campaign filled with them.Not to mention the possibility of creating custom LUA AI code for the vehicles you make. There's potential for hundreds, no, thousands of hours of fun here. For only 20 euros at the time of writing, that's a much better deal than a thousand hours of film, a thousand hours of lecture/literature, a thousand hours of other games... you name it.Of course, to get so much out of the game, you'll need to do some work yourself, too. Not only will you have to look for things to do (tournaments, custom campaigns, etc.), but you will also have to learn to play the game. I must warn you: learning to create all the possible vehicle types and making them work well took me a good 200 hours, if not more. This means you have to be prepared to learn. And by learning, I mean learning through trial and error.The learning experience, however, is fun. That alone would be enough of a reason to recommend this game, but the best part of the game very definitely is this: building your creations, of whatever kind you choose*, for whatever purpose you choose**, at whatever time you choose: there's a great deal of freedom and a lot to do here.*Submarines, boats, helicopters, airplanes, hovercraft, spacecraft, fortresses, hydrofoil surface-skimmers, completely unrealistic flying behemoths, land vehicles with jet engines because wheels don't work yet (update: now they do, but steering is complicated)...**The campaign, story missions, custom campaigns, tournaments...

								FTD is one of the best games I have ever played and is a great example of what Early Access is all about and I would urge other EA devs to follow this example (Also set by Space engineers and a few other games)PROS  A fun and addicting game  Skill based  Great Single player  Great multiplayer, when you can find an open game.

								Absolutely fantastic game. Nothing bad to say about it except that it needs some optimisations, as it can get very laggy very quickly, especially with very large battles (I'm looking at you, Onyx Watch trade fleets). But otherwise it is completely amazing, in every respect: excellent sandbox play where you really can build whatever the hell you want and the best part is that it actually matters what you build - you need to pay real attention to aero- and hydro-dynamics, center of mass, center of thrust, buoyancy, weight, size, and so forth before even beginning with the weapons aspect. This may make it sound boring but trust me, the building system is utterly engrossing and before you know it hours upon hours of your time will have been spent making something that turns out to work spectacularly badly. And you'll keep coming back for more, because when the program you wrote in-game fires the missiles that you built and designed in game from the launcher that you designed (mounted on the ship that you built), and guides them perfectly into the ammunition storage of an enemy jet streaking overhead... it's so very very worth it.TL;DR: BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT			"

								I had this game on my wishlist for a long time, then took it off. It seemed like the voxel thing was a fad and it wasn't appealing to me. Then I saw Robbaz play it, explain it. I saw it in action, and it was beautiful. Just like he said, minecraft mixed with mount and blade. Build something cool, make it destroy things. Between this and KSP, if I was a kid right now, I'd never leave the house.			"

								One of the best block based vehicle builders, well, ever. UI is clunky, game is very taxing (I can barely run it), and the learning curve is a bit steep. But, if you actually give the damn thing a chance, you'll be glad you did. Most of the negative reviews are people who played the game for less than an hour and said they couldn't figure out how the game worked, or they didn't like the UI so they gave up. UI is odd, yes, but again, you get used to it, and it works in the end. It's not a bad game because you can't figure out how it works.			"

Early Access Review
								It's pretty hard to really 'review' this early access game.  I'll be honest with you, IMO this game seems like it's one of those that will just never -not- be early access.  But what is here in this game so far is simply fantastic.  I almost missed it, too.  One of my friends introduced this game to me.  At first, even then, I kind of just dismissed it.  I played a little and was kind of intimidated.  Almost a full year later, I tried again, and stuck with it.  Watched some Youtube videos and learned a lot.  Now it's one of my favorite games.There's really no other game like this on the market for now.  I guess it's more akin to something like Robocraft than anything else, just not as a lobby-based multiplayer game.  Oh, and there's a lot of water in this game.  Like, a lot.  Hence, the title.From the Depths isn't easy to get into.  Luckily, the developer's recently added a bit of a tutorial system that goes over a lot fo the mechanics in the game to help get you started.  There are a few Youtubers that have guides and walkthroughs as well.  If you're interested, I recommend looking up IreLAN Gaming's Youtube channel, there are a bunch of videos by him that explains a lot and does some interesting builds.Let me give an example of the complexity of this game for you.Take a metal block, add a propeller to it.  Doesn't work.  Propeller needs power.  Build an engine.  Oh wait...  that involves placing an engine block, placing crankshaft parts, putting pistons on the crankshaft.  That'll work and give you power, but you can get even more power by adding fuel injectors, or adding carburetors and slapping superchargers or turbochargers on 'em.  Don't forget to pipe the exhaust out to cool it all, if it gets too hot it'll lose effeciency at high loads and eventually stop working if it overheats.  There are radiators you can slap on, too.The engine isn't working?  Oh yeah, you'll need fuel.  Don't have fuel?  Have to get some oil.  Make a refinery to turn it into fuel.So!  Now we have an engine, with fuel, which is now powering the propeller.  But the metal block isn't very hydrodynamic, is it?  Turn that thing into an actual boat, because water and air resistance is a thing in this game.  Sloped and angled building materials are very important to minimize resistance in order to maximize speed.  Now the boat's top heavy and keeps flipping, so add a keel.  Now, to turn the boat you need a rudder.  Boat's getting a little heavy, add some more propellers.  Hell, add some wings to the ship, equip some jet thrusters to the back, and turn it into an airplane.  Hell, put some ion thrusters on various parts of the ship and now you can fly it into space and use it a a satellite or space ship.Seal up the hull, add some airpumps, use PID controller blocks to set the ship's AI to keep it at a certain level in the water, keep it from rolling or listing too much, and turn it into a submarine.  Add some wheels, drive it on land, call it a tank.Oh, wait, we haven't got into weapons or AI.  Well, this ""review"" is getting long enough as it is...The sheer 'Depth' of this game is fantastic.  It's easy to get into, mess around, and just keep building and building.  My first ship was a massive, terrible Frankenstein's monster of a ship that could hardly float.  My more recent ships have been sleek, fast, well armored, and pack a punch.  The iterative design is awesome.The game's being developed by a very small team, and there's really only one programmer working on it.  The love for the game is obvious, and he's always adding more to the game while improving what's already there.  The game is far from perfect, and the larger battles will slow down even powerful machines becuase of the sheer volume of what's being constantly calculated.  The game has some rough edges, and like I said before the UI is pretty rough, but it is getting better.  The game obviously isn't for everyone, it's very focused on the combat.Definitely worth the price, IMO.  Especially if it goes on sale.  Like now.  Steam Summer Sale.  Get it. $6.00.  Game's a steal for that much.P.S. From the Depths does have multiplayer.  It's not as stable as singleplayer, but it's nice to have.			"

And when i say that i don't just mean stick generic turret A on ship base D and that is your ship .. oh no oh very much no..You have to design EVERYTHING in your vessel .. from its hull block by block to its engines, guns, defences EVERYTHING.. Game is a little technical at first but there are plenty of videos and forum's to look at for help or insperation. The community is one of the best i have ever come across in my 25 year + of playing video games and the developer is active as hell and is in constant communication with the community.In short is FTD worth it .. hell yes if you like the design and building of your own death dealing monster machines of doom 11/10 easy,  game is  smart  ( see what i did there nick ;) ) "

								Note : THIS GAME IS ALPHA STAGE AS REPORTED BY DEVELOPER : This game is a physics simulator for engineers, but its fun.  The game is currently stable as of 2016 jan 03, it will likely not remain stable, and have many bumps before it even reaches bata.  That being said, you can simulate ships, planes, and space ships in the same instance, I hear it supports multi player.  This is a good way to learn the basics of ACAD, and other simulation software used in the real world, but its fun!  It already supports modding, but because its not really released mods break between updates (as they should for an alpha).There are some strange bugs, and I play on a M-Tech laptop (the most stable and fastest laptop built, and will smoke almost all desktops).   The community is very active for this game, and are helping to push its development.  I would imagine that lots of features have not been  added, and if the developer iis smart, has not even started performance tuning, and it plays well.			"

								""I have yet to build a nice floating ship but instead, I spend a lot of my time trying to make the perfect cannon for the ship I want to mount on. But then again, the cannon won't fit. Back to redesign phase.""Not only that, it has a steep leaning curve that most of the time, you have to experiment something together to determine the outcome of your design. Despite its ""Alpha"" build, the game is actually playable as if it's already nearing release (with some bugs). And it is still good overall. The development team is very active for an ""Alpha"" build which is quite nice considering I really enjoy this game. This is, for me, one of the best complex sandbox builder games as you clearly have to think well in order for your design to succeed in battle.Also, RIP to all the Deepwater Guard Marauders used for testing all the weapons I made. 9/10			"

								I love this game so far, and the process/progress so far that has been done by this developer.Very rarely do you get a developer that actually responds to suggestions. This game alone can be considered a gem for that reason in my opinion.The game itself is a voxel style build e'm up. You can literally build anything from spaceships, submarines, battleships, helicopters, hot air baloons, and more, as is evident in the game description. As long as it makes sense in terms of physics, and common sense, you can build it.Admittedly, the game is very complex. Most get turned off by the ammount of completely this game has (as you can tell by the majority of negative reviews). I admit, I was too. Uninstalled the game after about 2 hours of trying and failing to build a dinghy. Came back to it a month later, and haven't stopped since.The designer mode, for me at least is where most of the game is, as I like to play around with the mechanics of the game, especially since they change almost every other day on the dev test build which I'm subscribed to.The campaign mode is relatively simple, but pretty fun. At the moment, just ""kill everyone"" to win. It takes a quite long time to do this, so you needn't worry about that.Edit: The developers are currently implimenting scaled down campaigns, so instead of you versus everyone, you get to be one of the base factions against a different faction.To be fair, there is no real sense of ""balance"" in the game. That's not to be taken as a bad way. Everything you, and your enemy has has a hard counter designed specifically to beat it. Enemy has cannons? Use shields. Enemy has shields? Use missiles. Enemies have missiles? Use lasers. Enemies have lasers? Use smokescreens.The only potential issues with this game at the moment of this review are that it still uses the slightly antiquated Unity 4 engine, and the bugs/performance that goes with it.The only other, honestly fair issue is the lack of depth in the tutorials. They cover the bare basics, and that's about it. Admittedly the game gets updated basically every other day, so it's going to be pretty hard to nail down a tutorial until you at least get close to finishing the game, and I won't hold that against the developer, especially since the in game encyclopedia-learning center leads you out to all the resources you can think of to learn the game.The community is small, but very active, and helpful, as is attested by the size of the workshop, and always will help you with any issues you may have with this game.I would wholeheartedly reccomended this game at full price, and even more so at sale price.P.S. My review doesn't cover multiplayer. It's usually unstable, and largely unfinished, so I'm not able to fairly justify a review of it. It works until people start to desync, and then it usually breaks down. This isn't a game that's designed around multiplayer, but may be in the future.			"

								""I have yet to build a nice floating ship but instead, I spend a lot of my time trying to make the perfect cannon for the ship I want to mount on. But then again, the cannon won't fit. Back to redesign phase.""Not only that, it has a steep leaning curve that most of the time, you have to experiment something together to determine the outcome of your design. Despite its ""Alpha"" build, the game is actually playable as if it's already nearing release (with some bugs). And it is still good overall. The development team is very active for an ""Alpha"" build which is quite nice considering I really enjoy this game. This is, for me, one of the best complex sandbox builder games as you clearly have to think well in order for your design to succeed in battle.Also, RIP to all the Deepwater Guard Marauders used for testing all the weapons I made. 9/10			"

								I dont think i could reconmend this game enough. Currently one of my favorites. The learning curve is incredibly difficult and even after 200+ hours i still struggle with making effective aircraft and airships but this is also what makes this game good as there is still something you can learn after so many hours. The advanced cannons are amazing once you figure them out and with the planned updates the developer has I feel they will be quite balanced. The developer is incredibly commited and squashing bugs that are posted on the forums in matter of days. The community in my experience is also very positive and offers tips without putting your designs down. The AI to start with is incredibly easy to use and understand to make your ships work and then with the introduction of lua and PID controllers if you know what your doing you can make them more effective. If you pick up this game, expect to put time into it before you build something that doesnt get wrecked easily. my best tips i can give for starting out is pay attention to center of mass and try to have it below water line for ships. Learn the advanced cannons and watch irelan's and rugers tips for building them. Missles/torpedos for starting are also very good.			"

								First of all, i must say i love this concept and think this game has great potential. Though it is imperfect as of now, I have many hours in this game and recommend it to anyone who likes to design there own things. My only real complaints are the detection system takes up a lot of space, making smaller ships much more difficult to build. It also has a very steep learning curve and even half way though my first playthough i still didn't know everything i need to know about different parts and how they combine with other ones.As of now, i would say this game is a solid 8/10, With potential to become a 10/10I had issues with the game do to my computed being connected to a work server, which is why my steam record is only 0.5 h, In actuallity my gametime is closer to 700hours			"

								From the Depths-	Not many games allow for such in depth vehicle customization and versatility as From the Depths. In this world of endless possibilities you are placed inside the body of a very creative protagonist robot named ""Rambot"" who is given a roll dependant of his situation. There is multiple campaigns to play through, all vary in difficulty, story, enviroments, and enemies. Along side the story mode, there is the vehicle designer where you are able to create and test your various inventions. Starting to feel lonely? Yes!? Well, there is also a multiplayer mode where you can play exclusive gamemodes with your pals!-	From the Depths has limitless creation possibilities. If you can think of any Helicopter, Jet, Boat, Battleship, Submarine, Tank, or Fortress, chances are that you can build it, and have it be piloted by an AI, or yourself alternativly. Along with being able to create your own monstrosities, which they probably will be at first, you can also build *almost* 1:1 scale replicas of any real vehicle. With the wide variaty of 400 different blocks, many different materials, and millions of different gun creation possiblities.-	With being able to create anything you can imagine, there are also very many ways to put your inventions to the test! With the 4 campaigns to play through, there are hundreds of thousands of hours of content to be played, though it must be noted that the campaign modes can be buggy and unplayable on occasion. With that being said, there are various enviroments to explore. ""Neater"" is the most complete planet with a very large and complex story driven campaign where you must defeat all of the opposing forces and grow your army of Artificial Inteligence controlled vehicles. You will face very many different factions that have their own building style and stories alike. This campaign may take hundreds of hours to complete, it is all dependant on how fast you learn to create effective combat machines, and manage resources.-	There is also a very incomplete multiplayer mode where you can play with as many friends as you'd like... or handle! There are very many party modes to play such as; Tower defence. In the Tower Defence mode, you must hold down a tower from various enemies with limited resources, so you must think quick. You may also battle Artificial Intelligence controlled vehicles with your own vehicles with the company of others. Campaign mode is also availible to play with your friends if you'd like.-	From the Depths is truely a unique game with very a creative solution to the vehicle/voxel building game genere as a whole. With endless building possibilities, hundreds of different blocks, and lots of weaponry options. Not only is the game fun to play around with, it has an incredible amount of campaign and story content to explore and learn about, with many different worlds, and variety of enviroments. With more updates, From the Depths is slowly getting even better, with lots more interesting content being added monthly. The developer truely loves his game and cares about what the community has to say, taking any- and all advice and seeing if it would fit the game. After 280+ hours invested into the game as of writing this review, I can say I will be playing this game for many years to come!			"

Overview                                                                                                                                                            Brilliant game, its not hugely expensive. Its fun, creative,interesting.  it still has some content to come, but in terms of current content, this game really does have some serious replay value. I've owned the game for a little while, and i will admit, most people will find the game every difficult at first, but after a while you can slowly get used to the complex mechanics and parts involved when building in from the depths. Building boats is surprisingly easy, as in, a slow , small, lightly armoured, lightly armed cruiser. But as you play you can really build glorious things. Im now starting to make space platforms, and slightly more advanced vehicles. WeaponsAlas, some of my favourite parts of from the depths. Unlike most games on the market, you engineer your own weapons of destruction using complex and simple tools. Simple weapons are for those just starting, already made, work normally, all you need is ammo and some space, then you can branch out. Cram cannons are surprisingly simple for how powerful they are. launch explosive 50 pound shells, or build a piercing machine gun. Missiles, pretty much do what it says on the tin, plus a bit of what seeking and some fancy tricks. lasers, helpful for more than mayhem, anti-ballistic properties.advanced cannons, for , i quote ""experienced people with too much time on their hands"".  performanceit dosen't lag unless your doing something really bad. movement is smooth, so on.Not much else to say.  SummaryThis game is cheap, fun, open ended, imaginative and generally a fun experience for everyone.However, the in game tutorials on various blocks aren't great, its time consuming, On all game modes( non creative) its difficult, its very difficult to use certain parts in general. However if the campaign is hard, you can always sneakily change the price of a few objects in there in-built modding tools! Only time i have personally seen it in a game.			"

								This game is basically like what would happen if Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program had a baby together, then gave it a giant railgun cannon to play with.The learning curve can be a bit daunting at first, unless you have a degree in physics and engineering. And the controls do take some getting used to. As an example, my first day was spent primarily learning what a ship's keel is, and why it's so important. Once you make it past the inital stumbling blocks (pun intended) though, this game ends up being a tremendous amount of fun. The sheer scale and depth of what you can create in this game is astounding, and it's still in early access!Also cannons. Really, really big cannons. Lots of really, really big cannons.Plus lasers, and missiles, and laser missiles, and missle lasers, and a faction of giant floating robot clown heads. I highly recommend this game!			"

								Probably one of the grandest most complex building game ever... built. You can design everything and anything in this game, from a little pirate ship, to a giant toothy beast of a battleship, where everything on it is designed by you. The propulsion system, the kind of armour used, the engine, the guns, the bullets the guns shoot, how the AI attacks opponents, wether it will be geared with detection systems or try to avoid detection all together. You could make a stealth submarine, with autocannons and torpedoes that crush the enemy from below in a massive attack. Or maybe you want a flying fortress, covered in armour, guns, and filled to the brim with high tech systems, lasers, particle cannons and warp drives. You could spend hours designing, testing, and perfecting your ship, perfecting it's weapons, optimising it's engines. Then you can pit them against other ships in massive fleet battles, where you can be tactical and take control if you want to. if not then the AI can handle it and you can watch the quite amazing destruction. 450 hours in and I'm only just getting to grips with Advanced cannons, how to make them as damaging and as compact as possible, how to up their fire rates and how to design shells so that they do what I want them to, I'm also only just learning how to make a truly glorious anti munitions defence system. (after much research into it, yes you need to basically do in game research yourself which is something you either love or hate)There is indeed a learning curve but it's not that difficult to overcome, but once you've worked out how to build an absolute monster of a ship by combining your new learnt skills, and then send it out on it's maiden voyage in the campaign mode, to conquer a faction, you'll feel accomplishment like no other. I'd say this is the best early access game on steam and you should definitely buy it at such a generous price, despite the staggering amount of content and replayability you'll get.			"

The camera controls can be a bit akward at time but gets the job done. I would highly recommend getting this game. This game is very playable in its current state. The battles are fantastic. There is a MASSIVE ammount of prebuilt crafts. Right now I would give the game a 8/10 but it is ALPHA so I consider that a great score.			"

								This is NOT a minecraft clone.  It stands alone as a brilliant game in a very different genre.  If you ever enjoyed building legos as a child, you need this game.  If you ever loved designing ships in Master of Orion, you need this game.  Imagine if you built something with legos, programmed it, and then it began shooting at other legos, built by other people.The AI shines in this game.  I would never fire my own guns, though I have the option to, as the AI is simply a better shot.  Countless games that allow massive creative freedom lack any sort of 'challenge'.  Not so in FtD.  Enemy designs are hugely varied and hugely dangerous.  This game provides 4 singleplayer campaigns, resource limits and gathering, and multiple factions that can battle each other.  Designing a single turret can be very satisfying, and there is a lot of skill that goes into designing ships that are effective.Did I mention that you can build submarines, planes, functional helicopters, and even spacecraft?  And your spacecraft can shoot at planetbased targets?Now, the game is good, it's entirely worth the full cost, but it is alpha.  It's a very complete alpha, but there is clearly polishing still to do.  Optimization and balancing is needed, though the game is very playable and very fun currently.  Shield generators are OP at the moment, for example.  I am incredibly pleased to have bought this game, and I hope to see more people buying it, and a wonderful future for it.  The ships are both durable and fragile at times, with armor and materials playing a very realistic role.  Ships can be blown in half, but they can also take 10 minutes of solid pounding.  Everything is built into the game.  If a shell hits your ammo stores, it can gut the ship, or it can do very little if you designed to prevent a chain reaction.  Everything has tradeoffs.  The very AI that controls your ships is built on your ships, and pieces of it can be blown up.Unlike most early access games, this game would be worth the price even if it there was never another update.  I would be very sad if that happened, but I wouldn't want a refund, because I'd still want to be playing the game.  I can give no higher praise.			"

If you ant to put it into simple terms this game is minecraft, with guns and ships planes ect But i'm not going to give you a sum up like that I'm going to full you the FULL REPORT!Pros- Overall top quality build system- Fantastic battles- Historically accurate ships/planes and landcraft built into the game- 4 diffrent planets built itno the game- 2 diffrent building styles (mouse and keybord)- Can switch between an RTS and building style gameplay- Easy to learn controls for both keybord and mouse controlsCons- UI is very confuseing at first- Battles can lag ALOT if you dont have a beefy PC (Might just be me, procced with caution)- Ai ships can get stuck very easyI just want to talk about the cons lastly because i feel that is what needs to be adressed upfront. THE UI: I opened the game and was greeted with a UI start screen that looked like a god dam 4 year old threw all off the buttons on the screen. I think the devs may of done it this way to be either quick and done with it or they may of tried to make it easy and simple. BATTLE LAG: Let me state out my basic PC specs before i say anything so you know what i'm working withCPU: AMD 8 core CPU 3.50 GhzGPU: GTX 960RAM: 16 Gb DDR3 1333 MhzNow thats out of the way lets look at what they reccomend.Processor: Intel Quad Core i5 @ 2.5 GHz (or AMD equivalent) Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 / AMD Radeon HD 7800 series The reccomened specs may work on simple graphic setting but on nothing else. Orver all it's either me or the game.STUCK AI SHIPS: I found it very annoying that AI ships would simpley just beach themselfs from time to time and all my work gone to nothing becasuse of faulty programming.All in all this game still needs work but is in a playable state if have have a decent PC and can put up with bugs and glitches.

								What is this game? It's the ultimate naval ship building game that just so happens to have excellent aircraft and ground vehicle construction as well. Everything is considered with this game, drag, buoyancy, center of gravity, everything comes together to either make or break your designs. And that can be a serious problem for people who don't have the mindset for this type of game. And I'm not talking stupid people I mean the kind of people who could probably be engineers if they wanted to should play this game. Everything is complex, and not in the stupid way. Every part has a role, every component has a job and it's up to you to use them to produce truly devastating weapons to crush your enemies. Do you want to make a 10 barreled 500mm cannon? Go for it, have fun finding a ship that'll use it but you can do it! Want to recreate the USS Missouri or the German Bismarck? You can do it. Want to recreate the Space Battleship Yamato? You can do it. Complete with giant laser cannon and all.This game also has a really robust and active steam workshop community which is a huge plus in my book. The UI needs work though. If you do buy this game, please please please don't write it off because of the UI. Because once you learn the quirks it's not bad to work with. So do I recommend it? Absolutely.			"

								After logging about 10 hours game time, mostly just designing BOATS THAT FLIP OVER AND SINK VERY EASILY, I finally started playing the campaign.This game seems to be the most detailed RTS concievable.  Build your units block by block if you want to.  Build your resource collecting block by block too.  Build engines and tinker how many cylinders, how many crankshaft sections, where to place carberators, more suerchargers or more local fuel tanks etc.  Listen as the torque capacity goes up and the RPMs go down!Warning: The learning curve is rather large.  There are still non-intuitive parts of the interface.  For example, if you try to put a gun together, you might have components that aren't contributing anything just because of where they are placed, and I'm still learning to master these nuances.  Looking at a block shows whether it's connected, but it doesn't glow or somehow make it more obvious at a glance - you have to double check.Same for engines - it's a balancing act swapping out a supercharger for a fuel tank to see if the power capacity goes up in unforseeable ways.  Maybe eventually this will all make sense (like an ""aha!  that's because there was only 1 carberator there and not 2!"") - but right now for me it's all very mysterious and fun.  :)Another Warning:The build mode also has a concept of what is being editted, which isn't clarified by the tutorials that I had gone through, so if you want to change a gun in the middle of changing the ship, I was scratching my head why it wouldn't let me place blocks for the longest time before it made sense.I'm sure I have not fathomed everything possible in this game, but it is meting out a great feeling of satisfaction discovering all it has to offer.--- FINAL WARNING ----The game really does move heavily in the direction of ""serious games"".  These are games which try to simulate real world problems.  You can program Lua scripts in FTD, and you may want to, if you have that sort of time at your disposal.  Personally, I start to wonder if I couldn't be spending my time better programming in the real world, rather than in the game....  your mileage may vary.  :)  Chin up!Also have a look at the very detailed models available in the workshop.  There are 1:1 ratio replicas of historical battleships and ...  lots more.			"

								Good concept but VERY VERY early in devolpment.As of now, The negatives outweigh the pros, But I got a good feeling this will change in the near future.The controls for building really need polishing, The physics are pretty bad as of now and there is very few ""blocks"" for building. But why recommend it? Because there are regular updates, Great dev to player communication and an excellent concept. This is the kind of EA that deserves finacial backing, Not games like Dayz, Stomping land or whatever else is released and forgotten. As of now, The game is a 3/10...

								Most people who have bought this game have 30-40 hours in it already.....just designing and fighting in single player.....in an alpha game......Thats unheard of to me. This game is indeed something special, from the freedom to build any vehicle you want, how you want, and fight how you want, to being able to play how you want - YOU design the ships you will use in the story mode. YOU decide who to fight, and when, in the Campaign.Seriously...I've played 5 hours of the campaign and killed 1/8 factions. That means each campaign could take you 30+ hours, with customizable campaigns and ships.....endless replayability.Multiplayer is on the way too. The Developer comments daily (hourly at times) on the Steam forums, while he works on the game. Updates weekly or less. EARLY ACCESS DONE RIGHT!!!!!!!!!			"

								This is neither an easy nor forgiving sandbox, but if you make a point to stick with it and learn the fundamentals of the game the rewards worth it.   As I write this review it is still an early access game but shows promise as it continues to grow and expand.   If you think it is fun putting your creations into a skirmsh  with various opponents and see how they thrive or fail inspiring you to improve on your designs or create better ones from scratch.   You'll have to learn all you can at making efficient and effective designs if you want to surive and not break the resource bank.   Making vehicles that compliment each other and work together is crucial and challenging and expect to spend lots of hours learning by doing.When starting out I'd recommend watching videos on youtube and understanding how things fit together it's not very intuitive and there are some thing you simply need to know before you set out.  The In-game tutorial is helpful as a leap off point but you'll still want to study others designs either on the workshop or those placed by the developers in game to get get an idea of 'how do they make this work?' and go from there. Test and retest, trial and error is key here, don't expect to master things in a day or a week even, there are so many possibilities and generally if you can think it you can build it, the big question usually is if you should.The only gripe I had is that he interface/controls take a lot of getting used to and feel clunky to me, but you can remap keys and such to something more to your liking but there is still room for improvement and as it is still in development I am sure it willl there have already been strides in this regard so I have high hopes for it.This game may not be for everyone but if you like sandboxes to play in this certainly fits the genre and is worth a look.

								Well as for a early access game its a very good gameheres why:-First of all the game is very addictive once you know how to play you can spend hours on it-Second this game is the best early access sandbox game for my opnion:build your own ship or plane or whatever you likewith misseles guns lasers and more crazy stuff with a cool battle mode as for an alpha game its very good!-As well there are few downsides like the game is hard to learn etc... but once you learn it you will be amazed let us dont forget its still early access so you cant expect super amazing tutorials yet you have cool comunity-Workshop. Well I like the steam workshop on any sandbox game but here its the next level make your own campaign your own battleships realy whatever you thinkso as for early access its 9/10 very well done job!

								I normally don't write reviews for games because it often isn't worth the invested time but here I am going to make an exception.The reason that I am writing this review is because I have noticed that the developers of this game are truely dedicated to this product, the game is constantly being updated and new (meaningful!) features keep getting added.Now besides how noble developers are from that aspect, that does not sadly guarantee a good game, in this case however it truely does!From the depths is a great game in which you build ships, fleets and even (space)planes to assure your dominance of the seas, it's a game that lets your imagination run wild as long as you know how to play it. The game sports decent physics and has great battles, did I mention elements of strategy gaming?There is however one big 'problem' that this game has, it is a big time investment, it has a steep learning curve and perfecting your ships is going to take a while. Now don't worry, there are tutorials (bit of an understatement) that will guide you all the way to the hardest mechanics, just don't expect something light when you play this game.All in all I wouldn't recommend this game for players with a short attention span, but if you have enough time, like being challenged, like battleships and love customization in games, then this one is a must buy!

								From the Depths is an extremely complicated game. I have played what I consider a large amount and yet I struggle to play this game. It requires you to learn so many things to be decent. That's what I love about this game so much. It makes everything you do feel like an accomplishment. I started playing this game a really long time ago. I would build my tiny little raft and sail around until I got bored because I didn't know what else to do, so I quit. After a few years I returned to the game and I realized all that I had missed. It was an incredible game. Everytime I play From the Depths I learn a new mechanic or a new trick for combat.Also, From the Depths recieves a constant amount of updates, and fairly large ones at that. You will always be able to find something to do in this marvelous game.			"

								It is a very good game, but the current update has broken so much, and I can tell that im not the only one worried about the way the game is going. Currently moving ships that are out of play very often puts them at the same point, making it impossible to use either without spawning and destroying both. Along with updates that just make the game more tedious and less streamlined, I can not recommend a purchase in the current state. The previous  update was fine, this one is a steep downgrade.To clarify, I purchased this game on a different account, and I have roughly 30-40 hours total in the game. Wait for fixes or a really good sale before buying.			"

								I got this game while on vacation. In 2 days I have played for 15 hours. This game is truly addicting and it is extremely satisfying when your creations actually work.I reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys being able to build their own units and how they work; flying, underwater, on water, on-terrain.I do not reccomend this game for people who refuse to learn or quit easily as this game has a steep learning curve but once you get the hang of everything it becomes much easier.Not to mention I am currently playing on a latop with HD 4200 graphics and it runs extremely well.

								This game takes learning. There's no denying that, you have to learn how to play the game before you can have fun.However, when you do it's a surpsingly amusing game to get sunk into. The problem i find in the long run, is that the single player at least is very shallow. You don't find yourself doing much other then building big things and wrecking stuff. and if you can do that, whats the point of going further? This is not, however to say i didn't have a huge amount of fun seeing how large a gun i could fit onto the chassis of a shipThe game is reccomended, but i really really needs the Dev's to look at the control system (which is difficult for newer players) and work on getting the multiplayer functionality going. Once that's working, it has the potential to be a great game! (take the main kind of mission setup, lower it to a single screen and go from there?)Edit:The Singleplayer has been Largley updated from since i last played, with a larger set of ships and more AI in relation to what you do. It's not so easy to buy nations off now. It's looking bleedin good!			"

Early Access Review
								Great game with almost 600 hours. For the price I can definitely say even if I stopped playing today it was well worth the money.When I first played the game, I was rather overwhelmed by the UI and how the game worked. To the point I got a refund. (I know silly right but nerd rage is a powerful thing). Pros - Well clearly the freedom you have in which to build things. From flying monstrosities that bring love in the form of rainbow colored lasers. Subs that shoot missiles and torpedos or harpoons, because dragging someone under the water is fun. Satalites rain now large amounts of cannonfire (cannons being given and update and now you can build even more fun artilary gun pieces, or railguns) :DBoats that fire hundreds of missiles, lasers, guns, and bring love and peace to all that resist, resistance is loosely classified. Oh and there are the death fortresses. There is a campaign mode, while not the greatest, it can be pretty fun to test out your designs against other armies. The campaign mode is a mixture of RTS and arcade boat / flying game. Where you might control a single vehicle entirely (or let the ai control the guns), while having the rest of the fleet controlled by the AI. The biggest pro how ever, and which likely kept me with the game for so long, is the epic community. while somewhat small everyone is so helpful, often willing to look at your designs and help you fix problems. Give tips, and tricks. There are many more improvements in the making so I am looking forward to seeing what comes in the future.Cons -Remember this is alpha so hopefully these problems with be fixed in the future. FPS and crashing. By far the biggest and worst thing of the game, it does not like large fleets, Up to around 25000 blocks the game works fine with some slow downs. But after that you can expect the game to come to a grinding halt, followed by crashing randomly. This can be highly annoying especially in campaign mode when you have to fight an enemy fleet that has many vehicles. Too many missiles and bullets willl also bring down the FPS.The other problem is AI. While you can deal with it, especially if you work out how to use LUA code, and or the automated controllers. (I use the automated controllers to do a lot of different things to over come the limitations of the AI). While you can make subs, and spaceships, there is no proper AI which can make setting up fully AI controlled Subs and spaceships rather hard and frustrating. So yeah I highly recommend this game. and am rather glad I over came my earlier frustration to give this game a second go. The learning curve is steep, as in clith like steep. But there is so much you can do, and once you learn the basics From the Depths (heh) of this game It becomes great fun. I just wish I could learn to build more restrained but hey I like explosions and rainbow deathray lasers.			"

								This game is purely amazing.  If you like battleships, tanks, airplanes, helicopters, military bases, airfields, building, or strategy games this is the game for you.  I have played this game for 153 hours and still want to play more!  In two months I have played it for over 70 hours.  The game can get hard at times, but there are tutorials that teach you how to do something by having you do it with a guide.  So far there are four game modes.  Two are based off of mostly water, one is in WWII, and the last one takes place mostly on land.  There are so many blocks and parts to choose from making the posiblities almost endless.       Just...just buy this game...In my opinion it is worth $49.99. "

								TL:DRThis is a VERY nice game, I highly suggest putting atleast 5 hours or so into it to get to know the mechanics.I do not even know where to start, this game is so huge, so I will start with how amazing the customization system is.In other games, you might have a cannon, and it does a fixed amount of damage and has a fixed range, on here, guns are made from placing several diffrent blocks to determine it's stats. Is the gun a small machine gun that fires fast? Is the gun a massive ship cannon that fires a massive shell that explodes? Or maybe it fires AP rounds?The list goes on.The same goes with engines, is it a small, fuel conservative engine? Or maybe it guzzles fuel but has massive power?Oh, and do not even get me started with the laser and jet engine customization. Oh, did I mention you can customize your AI?The game also simulates ship armor. Maybe your armor is really thick but unsloped. Maybe you have lighter armor that slopes to bounce lighter shells?The game is amazing, there is no way I could ever explain this entire game.Overall, the pros and cons are:Pros:- high amounts of customization- powerful ship editor- planes, boats, subs, spacecraft, and soon to be ground forces.- basic multiplayerCons:- complex mechanics, but easy to learn.

The game can get hard at times, but there are tutorials that teach you how to do something by having you do it with a guide.  So far there are four game modes.  Two are based off of mostly water, one is in WWII, and the last one takes place mostly on land.  There are so many blocks and parts to choose from making the posiblities almost endless.

								I can seriously recomend this game to anyone I meet, whether you like action ar creation. The action side to this game is slow when you're in the campaign mode, but once you start up the designer thats when it gets fun. Now keep in mind, you have to build a boat first. Once you've made a boat or found one from the Workshop just press X and you now have a GUI letting you spawn in any enemy you want. After you've played around with the designer and decided to open up the campaign you now have a large challenge infront of you. The campaign mode is amazing, that about sums it up. The building mechanics are a bit confusing at first. but after you've mastered them its very fluent. So, to sum this up, this game is creative, fun, and challenging.			"

								This game has absolutely blown me away. I'll admit it's difficult to learn at first, but well worth it. I can't get over how much there is to this game and it is still only in Alpha. I absolutely can not wait for more features. This game just makes sense. Most creating games there is no reason for building a fortress or a ship or anything. This game gives you a reason, and the better your creations are the easier life is for you. I love the fact that you don't have to spend all day contantly repairing or building the same thing over and over. You design a ship or a part, copy and paste. Improve it, save over it. Repeat. I think the only thing this game needs now is a research tree. So much fun, and so much potential for more already!  "

								First of all, please note that this game is in pre-alpha development. A lot of the main features are still under heavy development, and changing a lot. Only buy this game at this stage if it's something you don't mind.Why do I rate it then? Because it was well worth my 20 euro's dispite the alpha status. All of my clocked time I was enjoying the game, dispite visible alpha status here and there.Thanks to that I've gotten involved in the community, where the dev actually listens to the community, and responds to most sensible threads. Another great thing about the current development cycle is that players are involved in shaping and filling out the NPC factions. Not lazy design, but a great feature! Build something awesome and mean, and it might make it into the enemies.			"

								It's pretty damn hard to get started if you want any kind of working machinery. Once you understand it a bit better and get used to it, you can make some crazy contraptions.I'm being kind of traditional (lazy?) and sticking to ships for the moment. Going crazy with those missile launchers, tho.So much fun to see 10 or 20 them fire in series and strike a target.Now, something I disliked a lot was the fact that you need to level up in practice mode before you can enter the campaign. I guess it serves the purpose of making sure you know how to fight, and it's good that you don't have to do a tutorial every time you do the campaign, but the learning tools seem a bit crazy to me (a 1+hour youtube video? Really?)Now, there are also text and interactive tutorials, however the interactive ones kinda zip by so fast that I had to re-do the AI training a few times in order to figure out how to automate a gun.So far, sandboxing is a lot of fun. I'd rather the freaking flying units to be a little easier to understand, tho.----An incredibly, INFURIATING part of the game is that, when your stuff is in combat, EVERYTHING ELSE GETS PHASED OUT. This includes your repair dock entering combat while it's repairing your combat ship.Guess what happens? Your dock goes into combat while your combat ship phases out, entering a 500 second cooldown. If your dock has a minimum amount of guns, YOU'RE SCREWED.Another frustrating thing that seems to happen is that the AI seems to have first pick in the spawn order.Meaning that, if you have set a limit value of 20,000, the AI can spawn ships worth those 20,000, or more -using the entire match's unit value- and you will have second pick to the spawn table and it's very likely you'll be stuck with one unit facing an entire enemy fleet.

								Alright, I decided I should re-Review this game by now.This game, is a physics based Block building game, But No, this is -not- a minecraft clone, You are building war vessels, and structures, to fight the enemy forces of various sides, to try to control the planet.That is a simple way to put the campaign mode, the physics do their job, but I am looking forward to the Unity 5 Update so it will help make it run even smoother in large battles.Ground vehicles are 'slightly' in, There are wheels but not fully in yet.This game does require some brainpower though to make effective creations, or things that will fly or sail at a good speed, with how the physics work, Though the only problem I see is missiles like to 'fall out of the air' when out of fuel, rather then glide along, But this is I believe going to be fixed when they work on missiles more.

								Great game with almost 600 hours. For the price I can definitely say even if I stopped playing today it was well worth the money.When I first played the game, I was rather overwhelmed by the UI and how the game worked. To the point I got a refund. (I know silly right but nerd rage is a powerful thing). Pros - Well clearly the freedom you have in which to build things. From flying monstrosities that bring love in the form of rainbow colored lasers. Subs that shoot missiles and torpedos or harpoons, because dragging someone under the water is fun. Satalites rain now large amounts of cannonfire (cannons being given and update and now you can build even more fun artilary gun pieces, or railguns) :DBoats that fire hundreds of missiles, lasers, guns, and bring love and peace to all that resist, resistance is loosely classified. Oh and there are the death fortresses. There is a campaign mode, while not the greatest, it can be pretty fun to test out your designs against other armies. The campaign mode is a mixture of RTS and arcade boat / flying game. Where you might control a single vehicle entirely (or let the ai control the guns), while having the rest of the fleet controlled by the AI. The biggest pro how ever, and which likely kept me with the game for so long, is the epic community. while somewhat small everyone is so helpful, often willing to look at your designs and help you fix problems. Give tips, and tricks. There are many more improvements in the making so I am looking forward to seeing what comes in the future.Cons -Remember this is alpha so hopefully these problems with be fixed in the future. FPS and crashing. By far the biggest and worst thing of the game, it does not like large fleets, Up to around 25000 blocks the game works fine with some slow downs. But after that you can expect the game to come to a grinding halt, followed by crashing randomly. This can be highly annoying especially in campaign mode when you have to fight an enemy fleet that has many vehicles. Too many missiles and bullets willl also bring down the FPS.The other problem is AI. While you can deal with it, especially if you work out how to use LUA code, and or the automated controllers. (I use the automated controllers to do a lot of different things to over come the limitations of the AI). While you can make subs, and spaceships, there is no proper AI which can make setting up fully AI controlled Subs and spaceships rather hard and frustrating. So yeah I highly recommend this game. and am rather glad I over came my earlier frustration to give this game a second go. The learning curve is steep, as in clith like steep. But there is so much you can do, and once you learn the basics From the Depths (heh) of this game It becomes great fun. I just wish I could learn to build more restrained but hey I like explosions and rainbow deathray lasers.			"

								Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, don't even TRY to play this game. It has so steep a learning curve it is more of a learning precipice. However, if you can understand the basic mechanics well enough to start up a game, it's very gratifying. Also, YouTube is your friend. My personal favourites are Lathland and EnterElysium.P.S. If you have played KSP, it's sort of a similar difficulty, just about 5x harder to get the hang of, but once you have, it's awesome			"

								Ok so, this game is amazing.It's amazing for three principal reasons:1. You can do, almost, anything. Boats, aircrafts, drones, satellites, fortress, etetc..2. You HAVE to LEARN the mecanics of the game. And it's not hard, the tutorials are great if you read and do them you will learn (it will take time of course) but is really duable. So if you read people complanig about the game beign hard to learn, they are just stupid or lazy.3. Everytime you tink to know how to build stuff and you test it in battle, you have to adjust so many things that is almost impossible to get bored.In short term, if you like a game that give you challenges over challenges, a game that require you to actualy THINK and LEARN to become decent at playing and if you like building stuff: that's the game for you.

								I should have written this earlier, this game deserves it.From the Depths is a voxel based vehicular combat game, in which you create your own weapons of war and pit them against AI. Currently, there are three campaigns. Neter, Dangerous Waters, and Glao. In Neter and Glao you can make your own ships and are competing with AI factions to win territory. Dangerous Waters however is a World War 2 based campaign in which you can spawn in ready-made vessels based on WW2 designs. Dangerous Waters is completely community run, from what I know. Neter and Dangerous Waters are very large, where Glao is geared toward newer players and is far smaller. Personally, I prefer Neter over all of them. The real meat of the game is the vehicle construction. Any form of vessel you can think of, you can make. Boat, submarine, plane, spaceship, a flying death chicken... the list continues. All* weapons are custom made by you, the player. Configured to perform whatever task you wish. Anything from lasers to missiles to the humble cannon can be employed to bring swift death to your enemies. The newest addition to the weapon roster is the Particle Cannon, in which anything on the recieving end can be penetrated, smashed, shocked or exploded. Not particularly in that order.*There is a class of weapon called ""Simple Weapons"" which are basic single block cannons and lasers. They are cheap, spammable, and suck. Don't use them.The combat is a combination between how much damage you can deal, and how much damage you can take. Big ships are going to be large targets, literally and figuratively. The AI usually goes after the larger ships first. There are counters to every weapon, aside from the Particle Cannon. Cannons are easily countered by shields. Missiles are countered by the various anti-missile systems and anything underwater. And Lasers are countered by the water (partially), and by deployable smoke. Usually, you will want to hook up the majority of your weapons to AI, as a robot will always be better than a human brain... That usually just leaves navigation to you, however that can also be plugged into the AI.There is an indevelopment Story Mode in which you take part in several of the factions. They serve as a bit of a tutorial, I find. Although, there is an official interactive tutorial going over all the features of the game.Adventure Mode is a recent addition that I have not explored much into. It revolves around scavenging other ships that you find on the open sea in order to not be scavenged yourself. I think...Multiplayer is available. I myself have only participated in the cooperative campaign mode of Neter with some friends, however I believe there is a PvP mode. Unsure if it is a competion to see who can construct the best ship in the shortest time, or if it is just a brawl between ships you have made previously against other players' ships.Overall, FtD is a fantastic game. The freedom given by the contruction system is wonderful, and the combat is really fun. Except when you get absolutely pounded by ships far above what you were planning on fighting... Looking at you White Flayers.			"

Buy this game now! And stick with it.The sheer variety and number of blocks in FTD is extreme (and amazing) in other block based games (e.g. Besiege, minecraft) you place an block that is an all in one: weapon, resource storage, generator. But in FTD you get to design every little intricacy of your ship. It's both fantastic and overwealming.The physics is great, overall the game (except UI and tutorials) is very well thought - which makes game is awesome to play. To anybody who likes a sandbox, building or warfare game - this is for you.However that said FTD still has a few areas that really need impovement (the UI needs to be improved a lot imo), and the learning curve is like a ridiculous, but once you get to grips with the game (think at least 36h playing) it's a ton of fun.PROS:Very active developmentHuge block varietySuper detailedUnlimited build size5 varieties of craft (underwater, overwater, land, sky, space)Great community (you need to visit it here[\url])The best currently available building gameCONS:Really, really steep learning curve mountainBuilding methods hard to get used to initially (but yes, as the game says it is better)Unpolished UI (but it works, just doesn't look good)Doesnt make full use of computer capabilities ATM (not to say that it's slow or laggy, it isn't in 9/10 situations)Overall 5/5 would recommend.p.s. Did I mention that there is no build or fleet size limit - say hello to kilometre long mega ships (if your computer can support it).			"

								I love this game. There is so much creative possibility within this game, but there are problems, and only one of them made me give this a thumbs down. The tutorial. It feels a lot like homework and you'll probably find it easier not to do the tutorial and just try finding the info somewhere else on the internet. After the 26 hours that I’ve put into this game, I still know only a small fraction of how this game works. If you are into solving problems and engineering then this is for you but if you don't want to spend hours searching the internet or diagnosing the problems of your ship/plane/station etc. then look elsewhere.

 From the Depths is a game centered about building your own vehicles in Naval Warfare.  Be it a Frigate armed with a deadly swarm of Missiles, an airship with 500mm High explosive Cannons made out of steel, a Hovertank that shoots destructive Lasers capable of piercing armor and destroying the opponent from the inside, or perhaps even a plain WW2 styled bomber, the choice is up to you.The learning  Wall  curve may seem absurd and time consuming at first, but trust me, it will be worth it. There are so many different possibilities you can create in this game. One thing i can recommend is watching YouTubers (ex. ireLAN, Lathland) if you're stuck without any direction on what to do first. And do not forget about the guides, ignoring them would be huge mistake.Buy this game if you like:+ Building your own fleet piece by piece+ Slow paced gameplay+ Letting your Creativity looseDon't buy this game if you prefer:- Fast paced gameplay- Quick, Casual action- Jumping straight into the game, so to speak			"

								(This is an overhauled review, but my opinion about this game is unchanged in the least bit. If you love to build, get it.)I've been playing From the Depths for a very long time, and actually, I now assist with some of the game-building mechanics for one of the factions. For the sake of keeping things simple, I'll post below the positives and (few) negatives.Pros: - One of the most diverse building games out there. Seriously, there is very little that can even compare to From the Depths. You can build anything from a 30 block ballooncraft to 120000 block behemoths. (I don't advise trying to build something 120k blocks though. lol) - Customization is now part of the game in that you can create your own campaign with your own designs, or simply just modify the current campaign. This adds to the diversity of the game. - Graphically, it's not a bad game in the least bit, especially with high graphics. - Overall, there are not many bugs in the game due to members testing the game in a development branch, where most issues are resolved before stable patches are released. - The main developer is very active and responsive to community members. A lot of upcoming changes are actually due to members of the forums requesting them.Cons: - Right now, the game is very CPU intensive due to the current way the game calculates the physics, resulting in FPS dropping on most computers. This is due to Unity's standard raycasting being rather poor in calculations for large-scale battles, but work is being done to change these calculations to improve gameplay immensely. - The learning curve for this game is quite steep at first. A lot of things won't make sense, but then again, with time, this is overcome. If you ever have trouble, just consult the forums and we'd be happy to help!...that's about it for cons. If you love building and enjoying things explode, then what are you waiting for? Buy this game, enjoy it as your dream creations come to life!			"

Pros- Epic battles- Good upgrade system- Very complex. yet still intuitive- Coop- PvP- Tons of content- Unlimited possibilities- Decent graphics- Developers seem on the ballCons- The movement of your character is a little buggy, but workable.- Overall polish (it is still open access thought)- Not too much of a con, but I would like to see some more rounded pieces- Multiplayer is awesome and has the potential to be great, but if you do not know someone, then you may have a difficult time finding a game- A ranking system for PvP that is not too advanced, but very basic could seriously add some brownie points (once game is finished)- Not too much on the explainations (you can get by, but it is nothing like a tutorial)- The sound is ok and workable, but is dull sometimes and repetitive.- No epic background music during battles.If you like buiding games and/or may have some friends who would want to play with you, this game is great. Just give it a few hours if you do get it.			"

								There is just something about building a gunship to defend my oil rig from two submarines. The gunship manages to take out one sub and damge the other but my ship is now out of commission. I dive into the water and intercept the sub and start breaking my way into it's center until I find the mainframe and ammo supplies, typical pirates put them next to each other. I shoot the ammo crate and a giant explosion which tears the sub in half rendering it useless but I am still inside. I am being pulled down with the sinking sub. I quickly swim out and take a brief look at the cloud of wreckage sinking below me.Again there is just something about a game like that that makes me smile. incredible game already, it just needs some polish and clearer instructions.9.999999999/10			"

								Like KSP for gun fiends.Build a boat. Add an engine, propellers and rudders.Then add guns. Lots of guns. Try to fight an enemy, lose miserably.Do the whole thing again, this time, do a little better.And when you finally feel like you've gotten somewhere, you have to build planes, submarines and spacecraft.Serilously: This is a lot of fun. You're building vehicles (be it boat, plane, submarine or spacecraft), and completing story missions and campaigns. The story missions are a bit tutorial-ish, and rather fun (although difficult). In the campaigns, you wage a dynamic war against other factions, competing for resources and building ever larger craft.If you like building and testing things, this is the game for you!Pros:- Fun building- Fun gun building (Missiles, cannons, grenade launchers, lasers, all built part-by-part from constituent blocks)- Already lots of campaign content (37 tutorials, about 8 different story mission categories each containing about 5 missions)Cons:- Complicated, lots of things to learn- UI requires some getting used to, but is efficient enough (Lots of key controls)			"

								The game is okay. Cons:- Realism is an option.- For some reason I can fire a cannon underwater.- By the way of physics, there are some.- No aerodynamics model what so ever.- AI is okay.- Ion engines are not realistic by any means what so ever.- There are some bugs and glitches some of them which are really annoying.- The subs are a bit flaky.- There is no given unit for speed, alttitude, and other things. (hopefully that will change in future updates)Pros:- Easy to understand and figure out- Fun game to play- Can build massive ships, boats, planes, subs, spaceships.- Not a very hard game to run.- You can be creative in designs- Can make and command your own fleet- First person view is pretty cool- The building system is not that bad- Multiplayer (although currently disabled I hope it will be fixed and made even better)			"

								From the Depths is a sandbox building game where you can build anything from a slow moving battleship to a fighter jet. On Neter the main planet (but not excluding Glao and Ashes of the Empire) there is 8 factions ranging from the pirates of the Deep Water Guard too the Scarlet Dawn an advanced alien race. And you have to beat them all to reign supreme over the planet. Pros -Workshop-Many blocks -Full customisation of every weapon-Resource management-Missiles, 2000 mm cannons and lasers-BIG EXPLOSIONSCons -Buggy (is early access though)-Steep learning curveAll in all From the Depths is and extremly good game and cannot reccomend it more :)You could say this game is 'In Depth'			"

								Ever had that itch for something more than just minecraft? Something where the stuff you build is pitted against one-another while retaining that blocky, friendly atmosphere that you've grown accustomed to? This is it.Think of the most outrageous and OP vehicle ever in your head, whether it be a spaceship, aircraft, structure, land vehicle, or ship. This game can bring that thought to life. Why build huge airships in minecraft that can't really fly when in FtD they CAN fly, they CAN shoot, they CAN (and probably will) lead to hours upon hours of your life wasted away just to build, tweak, and perfect that one airship?And for 20 bucks this indie game has drawn more fun from me than many AAA titles I’ve played (other platforms/computers). Not only that, but a community friendly to new and experienced players alike, a developer who actually cares about his playerbase and is SUPER active on the game forums, and full workshop, custom campaign, and soon to be modding support!  Another thing, if you look at the reviews 90% of those who gave this game a thumbs down have less then 20hrs put into this. My point? It takes time to learn.Pros:-awsome community-LOTS of content-active dev(s) -workshop, custom campaign, and (soon to be) modding support-easy to waste hours upon hours of time onCons:-optimization is spotty, leading to needing a pretty beefy computer to be able to spawn in just one replica battleship-multiplayer needs to be reworked-I don’t have enough time each day to play this enoughWanna know something though? Nick (the main/lead dev) has stated that he’s working to fix and improve all of these things and more! Tl;dr	If you skipped to this before reading the rest of the review, then you don’t have enough patience for this game. End of story. "

								From the Depths is a really good early access game. Despite taking a long time to learn even the basics, if you watch a youtube series or two, read guides and put time into the game, you will learn it. When you finally unlock the campaign (since you have to reach level 4 to play it) and beat your first wave of DWG cannon fodder, you feel really good and satisfied. Everything must be built from scratch, whether by you or one of the built in prefabs. Building your first ship, your OWN ship (thats good) could take you a while to make, but using your creation to beat enemies is an experience like no other. One defeat in the early campaign can be devestating, and seeing a ship that got you so far reduced to nothing is actually sad sometimes, but that is part of the wonderful experience in the game. Oh, and I highly recommend Aavak, Enter Elysium and Lathland's From the Depths series'. I fully recommend this game.			"

								I gotta say, i used to like building games. Hell, I spent most of my life on Sketchup. But this Physics based masterpiece makes me happy inside, and reinstigated my love for Design. I spend a good 10 hours over the course of a week, just building, testing and finally creating my beautiful (in my mind, i like modern day [WW2 till now] craft. Sea, air or Otherwise) vehicles in the campaign to see if they can withstand the challenges of other creators (with vastly more design talent then I) with their Unique blends. Like the DWG with their sloppy designs that, although messy, have the tendency to do ridiculous things. Or the Steel Striders, and trust me on this, you better be prepared for them, my first (technically second) runthrough, I walked through the DWG like they were a Revolving door, the steel striders were like the door deciding to spin the opposite direction, and me catching it straight in the nose and balls. After the slaughter, I took what I could of the SS Vehicles and did some reverse engineering (Another big thing to do if your garbage at design, like i was early game) After that fateful day, there has been nothing but improvement. You can only get better in this game, you just got put some effort in and soon enough you might be clocking hours on a craft that CS:GO Players only wish they could acheive before attempting to saw their Monitor in half. All in All, A lovely physics based Freeform/RPG/Design/RTS Game that will only continue to impress. Just, Please, for the love of all that could be deemed holy in the world, PUT IN SOME EFFORT! Seriously, if i see another ""Too hard, refund please"" Comment, i might have to leave a link here for Dark Souls...And while your here, Watch Robbaz on Youtube :DYou can thank me later...			"

								This game has one of the most powerful vehicle designers I have ever seen. You can build ships planes and almost anything you can think of. My faveorite part is the weapons system. Instead of slapping on a fully funcional gun as most building games do it you have to build your weapons using a combination of blocks that each have diffrent effects on the final weapon. With one block set you can make the main guns of your battleship, the small AA guns and anything in between The game currently supports cannons missiles lasers and particle acclerators. Although the game is in early acess the developer is secretly a GAU-8 minigun that fires patches. In my opinion this is the best early acess I have played but it feels so complete that it could be a finished product			"

								From the Depths is a really good early access game. Despite taking a long time to learn even the basics, if you watch a youtube series or two, read guides and put time into the game, you will learn it. When you finally unlock the campaign (since you have to reach level 4 to play it) and beat your first wave of DWG cannon fodder, you feel really good and satisfied. Everything must be built from scratch, whether by you or one of the built in prefabs. Building your first ship, your OWN ship (thats good) could take you a while to make, but using your creation to beat enemies is an experience like no other. One defeat in the early campaign can be devestating, and seeing a ship that got you so far reduced to nothing is actually sad sometimes, but that is part of the wonderful experience in the game. Oh, and I highly recommend Aavak, Enter Elysium and Lathland's From the Depths series'. I fully recommend this game.			"

								From the Depths is the elephant you're going to want to eat with a fork.  I'm going to be blunt:  I like this gameOn the surface it looks like just another block building game that you can manuever the vehicles.  But under the natural and approachable way the keyboard building mode works, you'll build ships of any and all possible configuration, you will arm these ships, with sensor arrays, lasers, defense lasers, long range missles.  tactical warheads, harpoons, torpedoes, torpedoes that launch into the atmosphere to splash into the ocean miles away to start hunting enemy ships, that you can't see.  -  That's just boats -  I spend six hours last night, messing around with the different size rockets that I can make to see what a certain combination of things would do...  I have 49 Hours of Game time, and I'm just barely scratching the surface.  Then you have Subs - Flying Boats - Planes - Planes that can launch from water - Blimps - Planes that can be blimps - Aircraft carriers that can fly and launch their own AI controled planes..... and helocopters.  Weapons platforms - Refuling stations - long range sensors - ICBM's. How about that you also have above all this, a starship orbiting?  Yeah, you built that too.  Installed mainframe AI's.  And after you do all that fun, you go to war, where you command from a centralized command station, from any of your assets you have built, on a planet you designed, maybe with races you designed.....  For $20 bucks.Yeah, I like this game.  and it works.  and it's ALPHA.and the Dev is very involved.Yeah, I like this game.  "

								From The Depths is, quite simply, the best block-building game I have ever encountered. There are so many ways of playing the game that trying to nail down exactly it is that I love so much about it--there's just too much there to love! Vehicles are completely player-constructed and can be customized to a ridiculous extent, yet the basics of the game are simple enough that I was able to build a combat-worthy sea vessel within an hour or two of picking the game up. The graphics, while not fantastic, are serviceable, and the effects (especially explosions!) are satisfying.The developer, Nick Smart, is responsive to the community, releases patches frequently, and constantly communicates with the community about his plans, asks for feedback on proposed ideas, and takes community suggestions seriously. This is early access done right.The only downside that I can find to From the Depths is some of the textures are subpar, and that it keeps sucking up all my free time...			"

								Its OK. The experience for a new player is absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥and extremely difficult for new players to learn how to do things and what does what. <-- this was me getting into the game This game is great. It has a great community and is a perfect example of what an early access game should be. The game has a wide variety of blocks to build with, and allows you to build anything you'd be able to dream of.			"

								To be honest, this game doesnt suit everyone's taste. It suits mine because I am patient and I can persevere to learn how things work.Unlimited gameplay potential.Pros:Cool art style.Build mode is clumsy for beginners but if you learn the featured that used to bug you, you enjoy.Giant battleships hurling death at eachother.Lasers, 2 types of cannons, missiles and drills.Lots of blocks to build with.VERY long campaign - Im 4 hours into mine and I'm NOT EVEN SEEING THE END.Submarines to spaceships, everything in between.Building a bad ship can be done quickly, making a good one takes time and thought.Cons:Very hard to learn. I almost abandoned it within 6 hours of getting it because I couldnt get my head around how the rotation system works. I was using G when I should really have been holding tab and pressing WASD.AI can be a bit dull, mostly with aircraft.3 complex weapon systems you need to learn to be able to fight effectively.Engines are complex and designing them(well) takes ages. I recommend making 4 sizes and making them into prefabs.EDIT:The new combination of all resources into just 1 ""material"" does seem like a (love-heart)ing terrible idea, and removes the point of having to haul a resource you are lacking on to a base, eg the lack of oil at some resource pointsTL;DR:Good once you're into it but learning it is as hard as throwing a feather 5 metres.Try throwing a feather 5 metres.Go on,Do it.I'm talking to you.

								10/10 - Great game. Works perfectly on Linux.This isn't ""yet another block building game."" Rather, it's a very unique mix of strategy and vehicle combat. It's as if you could design and build the units in a RTS game like Starcraft and run around on the battlefield with them. No other game does what FtD does.			"

								Ladies and Gentlemen!I've played a lot of foraging/building/mining/crafting games.  I spent hours in Minecraft, Starbound, 7 Days to Die, DayZ, etc., etc., nothing eats up more of my time though than this game.  Ever dreamed of building YOUR personal aircraft carrier - what if you could then automate it and have it deploy several fighters to keep off enemy bombers.  Feel like you're in trouble from a submarine lurking below you..? Well, add some depth charges with a proximity fuse and carpet bomb the sea bed.  Anything you dream you can build in this game - and with the work the developer is putting in you can expect a lot of amazing features being added and graphics being tightened up.  The campaign is addictive and the vehicle designer allows you to submit your vehicle blueprints directly to the steam workshop!  This game is an absolute fungasm.			"

								Even being in early developent this is an excellent game, full of explosions, shooting and destruction. The learning curve can be a little steep at first but with plenty of tutorials and friendly forums that is not the issue it might seem at first.The potential it shows is phenominal, and I have every belief that it will deliver on that promise, the dev's having sought and responded to feedback from the community at every step. Building custom weapons and AIs is easy and yet surprisngly versatile, and show's signs that it will only get better in time.If you like MineCraft and explosions then this is for you!Editted 2016: Everything I said up there? Still true and more so. The learning curve has been mostly tamed by in-game tutorials, that potential is being realised at every step. Very, very recommended.			"

								One of the most amazing games I've come across on steam from an Indie games developer. Nick Smart - the creator, is beyond talented when it comes to game design - mechanics that have so much depth! His extraordinary superpower to churn out amazing, fresh, community driven, and well concieved ideas into great features faster than a team of highly trained keyboard-mashing programmer-bots is astounding!10/10 would bang on first date.

And then to top it off... the game isn't even finished yet, so much more is in store I hope. Playing a strategic, yet FPS game really gives this game the 4 dimensional experience. Would love if you could add some Solar, and Wind power to the game to feed the electric engines ;)This game style is sadly not for everyone, but is highly addictive should you begin designing and testing vehicles, structures, and sky fortresses.Enjoy, and know I can't wait for the rest of the game :D			"

You start out slow, you spend a lot of time designing your vehicles, figuring out the controls, etc. FTD has a pretty good tutorial now, but design-wise, it is all on you. If you do not have a lot of time to spend figuring out builds, I would save your money (unless you just want to support this superb Early Access game).

If you can get around these minor problems you will greatly enjoy this game. You are allowed to build any kind or ship(flying or submarine) and the put that ship into battle and test its skills. Overal id give this game a 7/10 because its a good game but the controls and GUI definatly need some work.			"

Paddle boats, Helicopters, Fortresses, the list goes on.It has a few bugs though, but it is early access so who cares?  Multiplayer says it doesn't have functionality but it is still fun to make massive ships to blow your friends upThe developer really cares about this game, and it is obvious that he does. I've had the game for a while now and he is still updating the game and if he introduces a bug, he fixes it quicker than most would!			"

								I am enjoying the game very much. The freedom to build and fight your own vehicles is amazing, and it works beautifully for an Alpha game. I do have some suggestions though:1) In creative mode, WSAD should always control horizontal plane and♥♥♥♥♥♥and space the vertical plane regardless of which way you are facing. The current method is unweildy.2) Please, please, please: Instead of having our characters be miniature helicopters that slide and bounce around, just give us humanoid avatars subject to gravity so we can walk around.3) Enemies should preferably be fastened to the deck for the most part. Hovering character melee/close quarters firearm combat is not fun.Obviously this is an alpha and glitches and mechanics problems are to be expected, but these are my biggest gripes. Overall, great game! I highly reccommend it.			"

								To be honest, this game doesnt suit everyone's taste. It suits mine because I am patient and I can persevere to learn how things work.Unlimited gameplay potential.Pros:Cool art style.Build mode is clumsy for beginners but if you learn the featured that used to bug you, you enjoy.Giant battleships hurling death at eachother.Lasers, 2 types of cannons, missiles and drills.Lots of blocks to build with.VERY long campaign - Im 4 hours into mine and I'm NOT EVEN SEEING THE END.Submarines to spaceships, everything in between.Building a bad ship can be done quickly, making a good one takes time and thought.Cons:Very hard to learn. I almost abandoned it within 6 hours of getting it because I couldnt get my head around how the rotation system works. I was using G when I should really have been holding tab and pressing WASD.AI can be a bit dull, mostly with aircraft.3 complex weapon systems you need to learn to be able to fight effectively.Engines are complex and designing them(well) takes ages. I recommend making 4 sizes and making them into prefabs.EDIT:The new combination of all resources into just 1 ""material"" does seem like a (love-heart)ing terrible idea, and removes the point of having to haul a resource you are lacking on to a base, eg the lack of oil at some resource pointsTL;DR:Good once you're into it but learning it is as hard as throwing a feather 5 metres.Try throwing a feather 5 metres.Go on,Do it.I'm talking to you.

								I gotta say, i used to like building games. Hell, I spent most of my life on Sketchup. But this Physics based masterpiece makes me happy inside, and reinstigated my love for Design. I spend a good 10 hours over the course of a week, just building, testing and finally creating my beautiful (in my mind, i like modern day [WW2 till now] craft. Sea, air or Otherwise) vehicles in the campaign to see if they can withstand the challenges of other creators (with vastly more design talent then I) with their Unique blends. Like the DWG with their sloppy designs that, although messy, have the tendency to do ridiculous things. Or the Steel Striders, and trust me on this, you better be prepared for them, my first (technically second) runthrough, I walked through the DWG like they were a Revolving door, the steel striders were like the door deciding to spin the opposite direction, and me catching it straight in the nose and balls. After the slaughter, I took what I could of the SS Vehicles and did some reverse engineering (Another big thing to do if your garbage at design, like i was early game) After that fateful day, there has been nothing but improvement. You can only get better in this game, you just got put some effort in and soon enough you might be clocking hours on a craft that CS:GO Players only wish they could acheive before attempting to saw their Monitor in half. All in All, A lovely physics based Freeform/RPG/Design/RTS Game that will only continue to impress. Just, Please, for the love of all that could be deemed holy in the world, PUT IN SOME EFFORT! Seriously, if i see another ""Too hard, refund please"" Comment, i might have to leave a link here for Dark Souls...And while your here, Watch Robbaz on Youtube :DYou can thank me later...			"

								One of the most amazing games I've come across on steam from an Indie games developer. Nick Smart - the creator, is beyond talented when it comes to game design - mechanics that have so much depth! His extraordinary superpower to churn out amazing, fresh, community driven, and well concieved ideas into great features faster than a team of highly trained keyboard-mashing programmer-bots is astounding!10/10 would bang on first date.

								Ladies and Gentlemen!I've played a lot of foraging/building/mining/crafting games.  I spent hours in Minecraft, Starbound, 7 Days to Die, DayZ, etc., etc., nothing eats up more of my time though than this game.  Ever dreamed of building YOUR personal aircraft carrier - what if you could then automate it and have it deploy several fighters to keep off enemy bombers.  Feel like you're in trouble from a submarine lurking below you..? Well, add some depth charges with a proximity fuse and carpet bomb the sea bed.  Anything you dream you can build in this game - and with the work the developer is putting in you can expect a lot of amazing features being added and graphics being tightened up.  The campaign is addictive and the vehicle designer allows you to submit your vehicle blueprints directly to the steam workshop!  This game is an absolute fungasm.			"

Vehicles are completely player-constructed and can be customized to a ridiculous extent, yet the basics of the game are simple enough that I was able to build a combat-worthy sea vessel within an hour or two of picking the game up.

								This game is basicly a better Besiege but mostly on water and air. The building takes time to learn and you need to look up guides for some things, but if you have some patience, it becomes no trouble. The optimization is good! it just requires a decent computer to play. Im on a laptop and I have always more than 60 fps. Its complicated but if you put time into it, its not hard. The UI is not great just being honest, but I believe its just a make-shift UI due to the game being early access.8/9			"

If you can get around these minor problems you will greatly enjoy this game. You are allowed to build any kind or ship(flying or submarine) and the put that ship into battle and test its skills. Overal id give this game a 7/10 because its a good game but the controls and GUI definatly need some work.			"

								Think of the movie Waterworld. But will rivalizing factions. Then you think about minecraft.. with a better interface, on steroids, with mirrorline when building in symmetry and auto-filling.. Then you want to place a gun on your new small ship.  Just put it down on a turret?  Nope !  First you put down the firing piece,  then you connect some 6-way connectors on the side of it, THEN you put some autoloaders, then you connect ammo-boxes to the autoloaders.   THEN you can add some explosive ammo boxes.. Oh it shoots to slow,  more autoloaders...     20 minuters later you notice your small ship starting to bank really horribly cause that 20 tonne gun on its side.. Why did my gun stop shooting all of a sudden?    Man i got no ammo. Gotto make some ammo barrels for big storing and ammo producers to keep them filled up.       Now i havent started on how to make a engine...   This is the most fun game i have played in a loooong time.  Also comes with a great community with lots of friendly helping on the forums and videoguides. A clear 5 out of 5.			"

Would love if you could add some Solar, and Wind power to the game to feed the electric engines ;)This game style is sadly not for everyone, but is highly addictive should you begin designing and testing vehicles, structures, and sky fortresses.Enjoy, and know I can't wait for the rest of the game :D			"

								If you have played KSP, you have an idea what much of the metagameplay is like. You start out slow, you spend a lot of time designing your vehicles, figuring out the controls, etc. FTD has a pretty good tutorial now, but design-wise, it is all on you. If you do not have a lot of time to spend figuring out builds, I would save your money (unless you just want to support this superb Early Access game). I am stuck doing some sort of one-off missions with ships I have to (beforehand) design merely to get enough XP to gain a few levels to actually play the campaign. 0_o			"

								This game is totally worth the money... if you spend the time learning how to do anything. I have 1 tip, DO THE TUTORIAL. This game has a HUGE learning curve and can be very annoying. Starting out i recomend just capturing an enemy ship to learn its internals and basic layouts of its type. If you want to get more complicated, there are plenty of high tier enemys and great designs in the works shop to learn off of. Making anything in this game is an art, if you make somthing with little thought and testing dont expect it to do much.Oh if you have friends you can play together, multiplayer is WAY BETTER than before, so if anyone said it was buggy or whatever its alot better now.The onlything this game needs is space exploration, it has space but its pretty empty right now (no pun intended)			"

								Very good game and very complex, but can eat FPS at times (like during battle). Alot of the gameplay is building, like turrets n'stuff, but it takes a long time to learn how to build them. The game is very hard, and is somthing you won't pick up in an hour and expect to know everything. Expect to put quite a bit of time in learning how to build (and the tutorials dont really help too much).			"

								From the depths... what can I say.Its like minecraft if you like building block on block but with more block variety.It has moving vehicles that you decide how to build.It has complexities I am still discovering after 200 hours.Ok so thats some of what it has.ProsStill getting new bits every now and thenStuff usually worksThere is no right way to build somethingThere is AI, primitive enough but it does its jobConsMultiplayer still needs work, alot of workThe game takes forever to load (ignore that 20 second load time unless you have an SSD). This has been improved but still not greatThe menu is a little confusing at times but has improvedFeatures in single player do not work in multiplayer (death ray, lots of hydrofoils etc)Do I recommend it?Hell yea. Its everything missing from other creative block games and you can blow up your friends.Tip:If you want to repair fast, get a second vehicle dedicated to repairing to repair you. Repair bots are too slow "

								This game has shown me that indie games can be absolutely awesome.Maybe I'm just a fast learner, but after a bit of messing about I'm already making great things. And I'm still just messing about in the designer, building stuff without constraints and such. Which is beyond fun by the way.And you see all those ridiculously fancy pants thingos in the screenshots? I just want you to know that while all these things are huge complex things which probably took whoever made em days on end painstakingly working everything out to the very last block, they're things you and I can make too. I get the odd sensation when I'm playing From the Depths that, yes, anything is possible.Unlike Minecraft, you've got way, way, waaaay more block shapes to choose from. There COULD be a few more shapes, but I'd say that'd just be going overboard, as it is I'm perfectly happy with it. I can make good looking boats, planes, helicopters, anything with what I've been given. In addition, you've got blocks that MOVE. As in, you point your mouse, a tiny spin block points to where your mouse is pointing.Unlike Garry's Mod, you have far more freedom with your weapons and materials. You don't have to hunt through the prop list to find exactly what you need, no, it's always right there in front of you, ready to be grabbed. And it's actually fun killing stuff. Obviously less physics based than Gmod, but, well, you're never really going to want to pull out a catapult to fight a boat when you could fire a cannon instead. Or a laser. Or a missile. It's fun killing stuff.And unlike Robocraft, this game is not actually♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's satisfying to kill things. When things lose blocks, they get blown off and float around for a while before disappearing. When you hit something with a really really big cannon, and it does a lot of damage, it really feels like it. There's no stupid block limits or anything. Unless you build something outside of the designer, which I have not done, since the designer gives me all I need: materials, and infinite space.Seriously, I know this looks like just another block-based building game, but it's the one that I've been waiting for (metaphorically). I wasn't expecting this even to be good. But it is. Just testing out my designs against enemy ships and planes is beyond exhilarating.If you've got $20 to spend, pick this game up. It's eyebrow-raisingly expensive for an indie game, but I'm saying it's well worth it at present.			"

								Started off well, the devs actually listened to what changes the majority of the community suggested. Unfortunately, a very vocal minority has taken over and turned the game into a job just to play. You have to do way, way to much problem solving and tweaking to build any ship thats worth while, which has made the designs in the workshop rather genaric and carbon copied. At one point they had hundreds of unique and amazing crafts, now its mostly the same designs with slight variation. The store page has some of these original and unique crafts in the preview images, but they no longer work with the new mechanics or, because of rule/item changes, have become incredibly under powered to the point of obsolescence.I had a few friends who used to play or were interested in FTD, but every one of them has quite siteing the sheer amount of time wasted trying to work around all the needlessly intricut mechanics that take hours to build, trouble shoot, tune, and finally impliment almost any ship. Especially in the later parts/challenges of the game. 6-8 hours of build time for 10-40 minutes (depending on the battle/enemy faced) of fun sucks.It started off as an interesting voxel war game and has become a mind numbing pile of frustrating mechanics and ugly ships whose community has become cancerous.

								From the Depths is an great Minecraft/Robocraft game is probaly the best way to put it. This game has great detail you can make the eninge and guns to make the system run at it's best I haven't had the chance to check out the muiltplayer yet so theres not alot I can say about that not thing is the Ai is great the learning curve on the game is still very sharp next thing is  the Eemey growth factor it seems that if you have it on one more easier ships will come if you have 0.1 more harder it is I think it is the way the Ai behave but it is extremly annoying to try and deal with. the next thing is the ""One day blocks"" It really isn't gonna do much as it is in most casses people are gonna rise it either way.It would be nice if you could add an misson where the basic block placing would be explaned and basic ship building skills insted of the way it is now the map It would be nice to have an option so you could turn fog of war off I don't like it much but thats all I can really fault about the game I am just going to recommend the game as it is barely but if a couple of theese issues are fixed I could easily recommend.

								From the Depths:Build all the ships you ever wanted to build. Okay not really, 'cause you will need hours to learn how to build it. I had the luck, that someone could explain me most things, but really this game is freakin' awsome.I played it only 23.1 until now, but its already AMAZING.You start building your ship. You think it's amazing. You start building a new ship, realize how♥♥♥♥♥♥your old one was.No really, every ship you build is at a whole new level of awsomeness!It's always fantastic to see, what you build with your own hands and how awsome your ship's cannons are.

								This is a VERY interesting game, and I don't really regret the purchase in any way shape or form.From The Depths may be discouraging at first from how complex it can be, and the learning curve can be moderately steep sometimes as you figure out some of the core mechanics, but in the long run, This is an excellent game.When you learn a new method, and master the design you're striving to create, it's a rewarding experience.Are you building a fleet of super light, affordable, mass produced ships, or floating castles that bring cannons the size of subway trains to bear? Will this design philosophy stand up to the test of battle? Only time will tell. Bugs pop up, and bugs quickly get fixed. Updates happen on a nearly weekly basis. Another thing about this game that I REALLY like is that the developer, Nick Smart, is really involved with the community on the forums. He's open the suggestion & constructive criticism, Which is the hallmark of a happy community & productive developer.			"

								This game is absolutely brilliant in so many ways! I can remember way back when I was just a little kid playing G.I.-JOE's in the backyard. I didn't need the expensive, very cool toys that all of my friends had. Although the aircraft carrier was totally awesome, and the F-14 Tomcat was just bad a$$. I was perfectly fine using my mom's tupperware and various other types of household odds and ends to wage war behind the garage... All I needed was the little, flexible JOE's with cool nick-names. My imagination would take care of the rest!Years later I am 36 years old, work my a$$ off and find it very hard or difficult to lose myself in my imagination just as I did many years ago! That is why I love video games. They give me the opportunity to leave my job behind me, venture off to uncharted territories and save the world from a vile, discusting and viscious evil with capabilities far beyond our very own. From the Depths not only allows me to venture off into La La Land, but I get to create the vessil of which I use to get there! Should I fly, or should I sail? Should I use a submarine or should I use an extremely huge aircraft carrier? These are a couple of the thousands of questions that From the Depths lets me ask. Just as I did years ago with my moms tupperware, I can create virtually any type of vehicle that I want to create... I am being serious... What ever it is that you can dream up, From the Depths allows you to build it. I do have to say that building your dream machine is not a walk in the park... At least not on the beginning. When you first turn it on the game does seem very overwhelming... EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING!!! As long as you do not let the complexity of this little gem detour you from having fun you will gradually get the hang of it amd before you know it you are building your very own Battleship with a vast array of turrets, missle silos, gun bunkers, engine bays, controll rooms and anything else that you might find on a Battleship. Along with other goodies that you would only find in... Your Imagination!!! After you have created a fleet of multiple armed and dangerous multi-terratoried vehicles you may sick your vast army on your friend, or foes vast army. Simply put... This game is a build it yourself version of the game Battleship, Legos, and Minecraft all rolled into one.Although I highly recomend this game and that I truly believe that this game offers custimizable options unlike I have seen in any other game. Please note that it is complicated. It is not a game that you can just walk right in to. I have played it for only thirteen hours and I am still having trouble with it. But for me, the ""Juice is worth the Squeeze""! Although it is complicated I am quickly getting the hang of it and having a blast while learning to do so... A BLAST! I just finished building a boat that I have been wanting ti build since I was in the 8th grade. I still have a hard time believing that something I sketched out nearly 23 years ago is right here in front of me plowing along as fast as a speed boat while I am blasting a set of guns that I custom designed myself. Oh I forgot to mention... You can also design your very own weapons which you can put on your custom designed vehicles.In conclusion I would like to say that if you are into building vehicles/forts/weapons, have a wild imagination and a srtong will to learn than this game is definately right up your alley. Everything you could ever want to build anything you want is right there in front of you on your screen. The learning curve is high as the Dev (there is only one... and he is great) has made ther game very easy to pick up as long as you have patience. Please do not let this game pass you up. It is a gem... A diamond in the rough that is still in it it's early stages (which is VERY hard to believe as good as the game runs) but is not far from being polished and placed on display!!!			"

								I really want to like this game, it looks like fun and is right up my alley, but I have a few problems with it. Firstly is that I have put just over 3 hours into this game at this point and I am not even half-way done with the tutorial with is not a great first impression. I understand that the game is really indepth and you can do a wide variety of things once you get into the game but getting to that point is a slow and arduous process. If you are a person that just skips the tutorial and starts playing no problem then good for you, but I am not. Secondly, some of the tutorials are more like middleschool quizzes wich is a tad annoying in it's own right. And finaly, one of the tutorials is a little more interative than the others and requires you to build an engine (after eight tutorials of doing just that) which I did not have an easy time with because I accidentally hit the ""fill"" button while fixing the hull which caused me to take more time than usual which ment that NPCs spawned and attcked me whilst already trying to fix my ship and build an engine. I know that is something that you need to be able to do in the game itself, but I was unprepared for it and had to restart.All in all, looks fun, but the tutorial is a huge turn off for me which I would bupass except that I feel I need it and it levels your ""character"" which in turn gives you skills it looks like you need for the campaigns let alone multiplayer. Other people are not jokeing around when they say you will spend a week learning to play this game prior to ever actually playing it.			"

								After playing around for a while I come to a conclusion that I cannot fix problems that others have fixed themselves and after reaching out to others on forums I have succomb to the fact that the ""ai"" function of this game(which plays a major role in playing the game) is completly broken for me. Tutorials arent that helpful, ran through most of them, copied them exactly, looked at other ships using ai, and in the end I have to be honest I have played months ago and managed to get great designs with functional ship ai, when I returned I have not. I most likely will leave this game and the millions of keyboards I have broke in a place I will most likely never return too.Potentially in the future when my Mind has mended itself I may comeback. Fun game Overall, that is if you can play the game.			"

								For some reason my hours have been set a lot lower than they should be, and I do enjoy this game but...Pros:Great fun and very addictingSurprisingly nice graphics and a good physics system.Building is hard but rewarding when you get it right.Cons:The game can be VERY difficult, even with the difficulty setting being rather low.The recourse collection rate is absolutely horrific, even if the game is supposed to take a while it really does take the♥♥♥♥♥♥making the start of games very tedious.When using an edited instance or a planet that has been created in the steam workshop, my save file always corrupts and I have found no way in yet to fix it other than remaking the entire instance and starting from scratch...A lot of people may disagree with me about time the game takes and not everyone has the same saving issues I do but because of the fact that I DO have these issues, I cannot recommend it personally.

Early Access Review
								While the gameplay is fun, the way that the menus and tutorials are written leaves me wondering who this game was made for. ""Hamming keys""? ""Rage quitting""? One of the tutorial quizzes asked whether a certain mission was ""Too hard"" or ""Too easy"". ""Too hard"" was counted as a wrong answer, with the admonishment of ""nonsense"" when clicked. The mission took me something like 5 tries to get it right, because the missiles wouldn't fly where I pointed them to. That's an acceptable bug in an alpha, but what's unacceptable is being told it isn't a problem at all. It leaves me unimpressed and not very hopeful that the final product will be any good.Beyond that, the options for gameplay are pretty limited, and again I have little to no hope for improvement in this area given the attitude of the developers, ie ""if you don't like it, you're wrong."" The gameplay options are1. Creative mode, where you can build anything you want with zero challenge and infinite resources. Bo-ring.2. Adventure mode, where you have resource limitations that force you to build using your head, but also are quickly overrun by waves of enemies that will quickly destroy you, even when the damage is set to 10%3. Campaign mode, which would seem promising: You start out with a large base that is both an excellent resource gatherer and has good defenses. But as soon as a battle begins (which cannot be canceled, despite there being an option for it--it is greyed out with no hint as to what enables it) your home base, and any ships you might have, turn into green rectangle outlines and are useless. You can't even stand on them and your little robot sinks. Selecting to end the battle automatically destroys your ships as ""casualties"", and then you have nothing.This game has a LOT of areas where it desperately needs improvements and bugfixes, but the die-hard fanbase seems bent on insisting that there's nothing wrong with it, at all, ever, and the devs seem to agree. Don't count on this game being worth your money.As a postscript, I've noticed that a lot of reviewers for this game have mentioned that the learning curve is too steep. I'm not going to discount or invalidate their opinions on the matter, since I'm sure the plurality of such reviews is indicative that there is a subset of gamers for which this game's mechanics will not be in the slightest bit intuitive. I, however, have extensive experience with some of the more finicky mods in Minecraft such as IndustrialCraft and Forestry, and therefore have that background in hooking up blocks correctly. The only hitch I ran into was learning that exhaust pipes are not omnidirectional and have to be oriented a certain way in order to attach. That said, despite fully understanding the building mechanics, and seeing a lot of potential for this game, I once again must say that I have no faith that this potential will be lived up to. Not only have I seen this attitude in the game's writing, the authors of positive reviews, and commenters on negative views, this review, despite being written out with great thought and care, is being marked as ""not helpful"", by who I can only assume are those die-hard fans feeling salty that anyone might say anything critical about a game they like. This is what is killing gaming.			"

								The game engine is based on an old version of unity that can only use 1 core of your computer for simulating all of the blocks of the ships in a battle, so huge ships or large scale battles are out of the question. Gameplay balance is debatable, with single player being neglected for the sake of multiplayer tournaments, and an open multiplayer game is often impossible to find. Most people spend 100 hours learning to play before they really start enjoying themselves.			"

								This game may look like the average innocent voxel game but trust me, There is more to do than it looks the sheer core of this game is amazing it may take time to learn but once you got it all down oh my...this game will have you hooked like butter on toast. Although it is in early access this game is by far the most complete game of early access i've played there is no doubt that the price of 20 dollars is worth it.The Dev works really hard and i applaud him for that. You clearly can build anything you want in this game and much more the community is really great too. This game makes your creativity shine like no other game. Like i said it may be hard to learn at first but oh man baby once you get that perfect learning curve you won't regret buying this game. I am still learning myself so i hope you can learn with me and FYI I didn't get payed to write this review. This review came from the heart of a gamer who is a fan of creativity and mind driven games like this.			"

								Nowhere on the store pages does it say this game requires a degree in periferal videogame controls, the control scheme is so convoluted it makes Elite look like a point and click. I would say that in the minimun requirements for the game, there should be a section about being unemployed and having all the time in the world to hand.Other than that it looks ok, but i didnt buy a game to read a bibles worth of instructions, f*ck guys even KSP made there game accessable. Im trying to cross an ocean here, not navigate a solar system.In fairness to this interactive tutorial people refer to as a game, the consept seems cool, but there is a reason only 700 people are currently playing FtD as i type....  because steven hawkins CPU gets bored easily.

								The game is amazing. It's great fun, an excellent sandbox and it's greatly rewarding to succeed. I played this all the time.Then I took an update to the knee.I can't start the game, and steam's policy prevents me from getting a refund. So, yeah. A less biased reason is the lack of optimization the game features, and the extreme lag and wait times that fill its place. This game is still a masterpiece, but I'd advise waiting for the full release (which will hopefully feature a framerate greater than 30).			"

								Test questions that determine your starting skill values are written VERY poorly. You can't re-test on that character. (They were written like an unintelligent person would talk, as if they used voice to text)Water depth does not add the level of cover that seems right for submarines.Wibblewobbling craft constantly, annoying.Gun and cannon barrels clip through objects. Stearing sucks even with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of balance, or not, or rudders ect.Center of Mass is not calculating properly in simulation, only in build mode.Making ship heavier made it fly into the air more because of crazy bouyance calcs.Stearing with a rudder always pulls hard to one side, the heavier your ship the less you notice.Stearing often does nothing or forces you in the wrong direction.Steam overlay confuses the controls in the game resulting in cannot use steam overlay.The best part of the game is thinking about what you want to build in it, not the actual playing of the game. At least for me this is very accurate. Did I mention it's a super neat idea? Like Lego's but with much much less imagination.This game is not for me until it gets improved.

I'm setting this to a negative review until the one-resource-system gets reverted back to the original.Insulting others for caring about and being concerned about the way the game is headed, leading a campaign of rep bombardments, primarily against me and my closer colleagues, has led me to the conclusion that Nick no longer has the game's interests at heart.The truth will be known, and the world will come to know that I was right.

								I loved playing this game, it was fun building gigantic ships and planes. I spent weeks designing enormous ships that I would never be able to build in the campaign due to the resource cost. Still, It was worth it just for the reactions I got from my friends when they fought me.Then an update came.Engines were reworked into♥♥♥♥♥♥ they became less powerful and made anyone playing before the update relearn the engine mechanics. Either you build a tiny ship or you build a complex engine to get maximum power for your mediocre ship. Thankfully, any engines built before the update still worked fine so I didn't complain.Then more updates came.Cannons were reworked, different types of cannons were added, more and more♥♥♥♥♥♥became complicated.Wanna build a ship/plane larger than the titanic? Sure, go build a complicated mess and pretend it was worth your time, now watch as future updates make it useless. I remember a time when you didn't have to do the tutorial a million times.			"

								Look, I respect greatly what they were trying to do with this (and if I were making a similar game, I might've done it too), but they are just being too cutesy and complex with their mechanics. Now MAYBE it is justified, and MAYBE I'm just not 'putting in enough time to know it'- but I just chased around a ship in a tutorial mission for almost an hour trying to destroy it with missles that seemed very interested with flying off about a mile away from where I was looking. That's the kind of stuff that lets you know off the bat that it's definitely going to be a masterpiece. I understand that it is alpha, but this shouldn't be a game where the player should have to worry about whether or not the fate of their creations depends on the block they just placed. If you're looking for a fun game, leave this game alone. But if you seriously want to wade through all the technicalities and asterisks to achieve creating the machines and vehicles this game might offer, it's your money.			"

								Saw some interesting videos about the game and decided to give it a try.The game strongly suggests that you complete a series of tutorials that are intended to teach you the various aspects of the game. This is smart, since it would be kind to call the building controls clumsy, and they have a steep learning curve to gain any level of control. This is not helped by the tutorials and tooltips insisting on telling you the default control mappings and not using any re-mappings you may have done.I was a bit surprised at how fast the tutorial ramped up the difficulty, with a very early tutorial ""Muddy Waters"" giving you a very short time to repair a ship hull and build an engine before enemy ships blow your ship apart. I'm sure this is a trivial task for someone who has played the game for months and is an old hand at using the clumsy building controls to make numerous ships, but having only about 10 minutes to fight the controls to build anything is quite the challenge only a few tutorials in.Just two examples of clumsly build controls:  1) Placing and motion are relative to the camera, not an absolute coordinate system. So as you try and find a camera angle where you can see what you are doing in cramped locations your control direction keeps changing with respect to trying to place blocks on the ship.  2) The cursor keeps moving toward/away from the camera every time you place or remove a block (depending if you right or left click). So if I'm trying to place blocks horizontally I have to keep re-adjusting the place cursor back to the row I'm working on.I'm sure with enough time I could get used to how it behaved, except for the fact that you do not get an opportunity and are thrown into the timed build mission long before you have a chance to get used to the controls. It is literally the second time you build anything, and the first time was a ""place the block I tell you here"" sandbox mission.The alpha nature of the game is very evident in the help/tutorial sections: spelling errors, sentences that just sort of trail off and missing words are just some of the more obvious. I've also encountered strange graphical glitches like the water surface vanishing; sometimes it is there and looks nice and other times not.TL;DR The game shows some promise, but give it a pass until it gets out of alpha unless you like torturing yourself.(edit for spelling - thanks jordank321)			"

								When people say a game is hard, most people usually think,  I know it's going to take some time to get used to it, and I may not enjoy the struggles through the game, but in the end, I can succeed. (Don't take that as inspiration . . .)This game isn't hard. It's much higher.Whenever I play a game, or, ya know, do actual thinking work in real life, I can always see the most difficult part first.Starting. (As in the act of starting.)And there's too much work to start out. Vehicles aren't in play yet there's nothing telling you how to put it in play, two different top-down screens to control units (or something like that), EXTREMELY cluttered UI, and lack of polish. . . . That turned into a cons list. Oh well.If that didn't make you want to look away from this for quite a while, then keep reading. OHMYFSM, THE UI IS HORRIBLE. Mostly just the building UI. Whenever you want to build, you always have to have a block selected. But this will get in the way. FIX: Use keyboard controls. But that's not a complete fix; you must always have something selected. This just makes it stay the same size. This would be less of a problem if the art style was changed. Yeah, I like it, but it's just terrible for building. If you don't know what I mean, you can look at the screenshots.I actually went through all the tutorials. Some were great; interactive, able to make what you want, teaching you. Some were just manuals. Some were links to Steam manuals (I'm not joking on that. Seriously). Some were step-by-step building tutorials that taught you how to build something . . . if you paid attention . . . kinda. That means that they were just bad. The tutorials didn't really do anything, so YouTube guides were the answer. . . . They didn't help that much.I feel like this can be related to a Mount & Blade game. Starting out is still the hardest part. Once you have enough resources or large enough fleet (or army in this metaphor), it's a lot easier to actually do things.The game has a lot of potential. It's just that it needs polish, a lowering of difficulty, an art style change (or tweak) for building mode, and more polish. I don't really mind difficult games. But this difficulty (at least for starting out, the most important part) is so absurd. Even when the difficulty was as low as it could go. I can't recommend it.  Yet. I suggest waiting a few months or until it's out of Early Access before looking at this again. "

								I'll give this game another try when the sea sickness wears off.Where do I begin?  Ok, first, the lead dev seems to have some kind of thign against the normal intuitive controls used by games liek minecraft ot Robocraft.  That makes the controls for this game about as intuitive as compiling a linux kernal is to a happy emachine user.  First I tried the campaign.  I saw a youtube video from Robbaz and thought ""that looks great"".  So there I was not quite standign , but not quite floating on a cell shaded hull of a weird floating house on massive rollign swells of the ocean.  I dont' knwo what I pressed that disconnected me from the little robot body, but I wasn't in build mode, because I coudl switch into it.  The fly speed is set way high so strafing was disorienting as hell.  Up and down ofted plunged me into the ocean.  There were signs identifying systems, which was great!  But control indicators were awful.  I hopped into the little skiff.  I figured out how to start the engine.  Yay.  Then i figured out how to control it.  But the littel robot hopped in and I was still floating abouve the skiff.  The UHJK keys worked.  Thats a weird combination when you could just use asdw and a locked cameral.  Whatever, so I quickly accidentalyl drove the skiff off screen.  When i caught up I killed the engine manually, because who thinks to hit T+G to kill the engine.  I dunno about you but I have a single button brake in my car and I figure that is as intuitive as it comes.Clearly I wasn't ready for a campaign, so i quite out of that, which took a nausiating length of time readign white text on light sea blue background.I went into the vehicle designer thinking surely that would be somethign liek the Robocraft garage.  hoyl hell, that was worse.  I was suddenly on a 3X3 raft with the little robot and the waves were crazy.  Ok, so i built out some pontoons and it got more stable great.  The turtorial on engine building was awesome, but again not mouse friendly.  I felt like I was back to the old rubber ball mice I had to pick it up and reset it on the pad so many times.  The best is when a part would spawn for the tutorial, it woudl reset the view (damn thats disorienting), spawn in a cloud of black smoke, and spawn behind other parts so I could never tell what had just spawned.Long story short I flipped my skiff as soon as I tried to drive it.  That caused the build mode to flip to, but the little robot was still right way up and spinning.  so as I was tryign to fix my skiffs orientation, the world was spinnign and the waves were rolling.  I nearly got sick and said screw this.I want to be fair.  I love the idea of the custome engines.  I love the variety and the idea of buildign vehicles.  But this is over complicated, and does very little to help people enjoy it.  This dev needs to get in touch with the Freejam guys who do Robocraft, get his head fixed about controls and gui design, and maybe this idea can take off.Right now I'm wishing I hadn't spent $20 on this.  But I want this to be awesome enough that I'm not ready to ask for my money back.  I'll check back when the sea sick wears off.			"

								Too bad. You died.That's what the most common thing about this game. At least after 7h of playing.But lets start over.The games starts by freezing in the loading screen for 1-2 minutes. After that you are greeted by an UI in need of improvement.So, I started with the ingame tutorials. I got through half of them (36). Except one mission, they were boring and only teach a little bit.In one mission, you just have to rebuild a battleship. With limitted resources you start rebuilding it. Then start over again since the pipes won't connect. The hollow pipes have directions in which gas can flow. Worst part? You get attacked by enemies during your repair. Only weapon you have are missiles you have no idea how to use them, they just seem to do random stuff. Lucky enough, I could repair my engine once again before I run out of resources and could continue the mission.After each tutorial mission you enter a quiz to get some XP. A lot of question were never explained in the tutorial, so you have to just guess. Some questions are wrong - probably confused by own phrasing with double-tripple negation. Also, there are opinion based questions. You don't share the opinion of the dev? Too bad, you fail!For my last 1-2h of gameplay, I started just a singleplayer map.After 10-20 minutes you are overrun by different enemies. I was attacked by submarines, without any knowledge how to defend. The tutorial said, there are torpedos, but never explained how to build them.Next try, I suddenly die. My character was hit by a laser out of nowhere. On the death screen I saw only a laserbeam from far away. The enemy was far beyond render distance.Try again, I engage an enemy ship, suddenly my ship vanish. No explosion, no detectable hits. Just disappears and I lose.Last try, I was hit by laserbeam again.Am I too slow?The FAQ of the game states, it aim at slower paced gamestyle.This promise is not delivered!This game has potential. Lots of it. But in current version, I cannot recommend it.			"

								Huh.  I read a lot of the reviews and they are universally positive.  After seeing the screenshots, the game looks quite interesting.  The UI looks clunky, and the graphics aren't that good, but I was willing to give it a shot.And I gotta tell you, this game lost me pretty quick.The UI is worse than clunky: It is downright incomprehensible at times, and is a serious of confusing beveled rectangles that are sometimes buttons, sometimes radio controls and other times just static text.I had to alt-tab out of the game and look up hints on the forum on what to do or how to manipulate the UI, and these hints were sometimes very vague.  The graphics are jarring and mismatched, as if six different styles of art were crammed together.  (Or six different artists worked on the game.)  The audio is not very good, with the same 30 second sea sound effect looped over and over.  The build mode is clunky and difficult to figure out;  Creating just a simple craft required several hours of tweaking and messing about.The missions are many and varied, but at times it's impossible to figure out what you are supposed to be doing due to the minimal mission-objective UI.  Building the right sort of craft to complete each mission takes a while (due to aforementioned tweaking) and I lost patience trying to win each scenerio.The controls are atrocious.  It uses a lot of none-standard, none-intuitative key binds for critical functions, and it's difficult to play the game on a laptop because of this.There's a lot of depth to this game (ha!), considering how many building parts there and how they can be linked together to make all kinds of vehicles, but it's really just not very playable or enjoyable game to me.   Which is weird, because I read the reviews and people are absolutely raving about this game.  But to me. From the Depths feels like a very early prototype game, a proof-of-concept that needs a LOT of shine and polish before I would have considered it a public alpha.			"

								Great concept, horrible execution, not much fun. The controls are horrible, your fighting the camera constantly, the building is tedious, and the controls for that are miserable as well. Just trying to figure out how to build a simple boat that works is a three hour long process. The scheme of the game is all over the place, steampunk, future robot, and post apocalyptic, all mixed together, but not in a good way, more in a different artists having very different ideas. The water is invisble untill your under it. Its just so many little things that make this one big giant crap fest.  The tutorials are also confusing, but they give you plenty to choose from. Read about how to, watch someone else do it, and play through it yourself. However, they aren't very clear, more of click on this to add this now add this, place some of these, and there you go your a good Stanley! After you do them, your like but wait, what did I just do exactly? The controls, argggg the controls. There are some games where your pretty sure thats the difficulty is dealing with the terrible controls or fighting a terrible camera, well this gives you the power of both. Every time you place a block the screen kicks a block forward towards the cameras direction. Which can and will screw you over. Trying to change your creations is also a nightmare if you forgot to add a chair.   I know this is in EA so hopefully they will do something about the control scheme. Because you know half the point of this game is to build stuff to fight others with. So far building crap is so horrible and annoying that only the diehards are seriously building. And thats great, the world needs architects, I'm just not an engineer by trade and didn't read in the description that I should be.			"

								I was never able to play the game properly due to me being left handed. The tutorial is not linked to key binds so I had to guess what to press when the tutorial loaded. Also, the key bind section is messy and you can't read all of what you're changing so you have to guess what you're changing aswell. I tried using the defalt controls but because the game focuses on building things with your mouse so i kept on mis-clicking untill i eventually quit.It looked fun though on youtube so ill keep it but not play untill they fix.

								The worse-than-clunky UI and controls in this game make it extremely difficult to jump into. I went in for a bit over an hour and figured out the basics, but simply found it too much work to be fun. Either wait for a bit more development and for the UI and controls to be cleaned up before purchasing or for a sale unless you're really willing to work long hours to get to your hard-earned fun.There's a good game buried somewhere in here, but the impossible user interface and controls make it not worth the effort to reach.At the level it's currently at, the game is not worth $20 USD.

								There is currently no fun aspects to this game unless you find 3+ hours of tutorials and having to use imagination to make your own story fun. It's basically figure it out simulator and I no longer have the patience to try to figure it out myself. I played less than an hour because I wanted to be able to refund if the game did not interest me, and indeed it does not. Many hours of boring video tutorials that tell you how the mechanics work... but not how to work the keys to do so. I spent 15min stuck in a camera view that no button I pressed fixed, and there was no said button in the control menu that told me what to press, I had to restart the game to fix it. The game in it's current Alpha state is not optimised at all for multithreaded CPU's and when in intense combat it renders it unplayable for typical PC gamers. If a game uses 30% of an 8 core processor at the start menu... you know you're in for a bad time...			"

								This is potentially a great game. The mechanics are wonderful. It runs very fast and smooth and i do love a good meta-strategic long-game.HOWEVER. beginning the game even with assistance of an experienced player is a long, frustrating and unrewarding experience.First you're going to have to get to grips with a very fast, hotkey based control system. -which is great - except you can't modify the keys to your liking so if you're intuitive and fast with another game or program you're going to have to UNLEARN all of that first.Right now i can't stop hitting E because i use it to pitch in a couple of other games (those games allow me to tune the controls when a button clashes) but FTD forces me into a tactical map view about once a minute.FOR THE LOVE OF BISCUITS WHY CANT I REMAP CONTROLS?Also you are in two places. you have an avatar for some reason. No idea why since it's invincible, doesnt do the construction and has such bizarre movement characteristics that you never want to be first person viewing.The second viewpoint is a sort of spectator-cam that moves at supersonic speed with a momentary blip on the directional key. -again adding to the feeling of being trapped in a clumsy, jerky body with no influence on surroundings.OK, putting all this aside you set about trying to learn the ropes 'cause it looks like fun once you know them. You have a few options:Vehicle Designer - infinite resources, virtually nothing to restrain you or drive your build. What am i building for? oh, the campaign. but i have no idea what works in campain. 'cause i'm here trying to get ready for campaign. SO i place blocks for an hour or two, get bored with how awful they look and exit to main menu.Campaign - i go to start campaign since many games use missions as a way to introduce game concepts - Offering microgoals to help the player understand mechanics and priorities - maybe this game will be like that. Nope. Just plopped on a raft in the middle of a hostile ocean with 5 factions at high development levels and minimal pointers on how to even begin to gather resources.Multiplayer - obviously a place you go once the new player skill-cliff is a distant nightmare. I can't offer you any reports on this.I'm glad i own this game because when it's done it could be wonderful but having to re-train my hands to use it simply because the devs won't let players remap controls spoils the experience enormously.TLDR: Great potential. Maybe awesome if you've been playing since day one and all the complexity got added underneath you but it's becoming inaccessible to new players. Too little reward for your time.			"

If you have been playing this game for a long time you have a better chance but this is still no promise.You could always spend several days looking for tutorials on every aspect of the game on youtube (i recommend Aavak, Rosefall and IRLan) but who wants to study for days in order to play a single player game with limited opponents.The game is also in dia need of optimisation, i realize that this game is stated as being in alpha but honestly shouldnt be. The devs are hanging on to the alpha status in order to excuse their lack of attention to anything people are telling them.			"

The building controls are wonky, and its not going to be like any other game in terms of building. Not starmade, not minecraft, not fallout, not anything like those at all. Its very complicated.And things like missiles give you a tutorial. But they arent always the most useful or explanatory. And the game is poorly optimized.It would be much better, with a solid construction system and with the needed optimization.6/10All in all, this is early access.

								To be honest, I love this game but can't in good conscience recommend it right now.  Yes, it's early access.  Yes, I know the game will change.  Yes, I know that make tutorials hard.  None of that softens my stance that this isn't worth the time it takes to find out how to play.  Not learn how to play because there's nothing in the game that is useful in *telling* you what to do.  Throwing together a hull and propellers isn't hard, but once you get into building engines or weapons the built-in guides are so scanty that they are very little use.  Especially since some parts only connect in certain ways and there is no easy way to see what is connected without tracing the entire path.  And you need those long paths since the guide examples with one (or a few) of each part are useless in the real game.    Don't get me wrong, the guides are good.  It's the game that doesn't give me the info I want in a useful way.  There's no way to know the number of parts I need without building them.  I *think* it's the ratio between parts that's important, but there's no way to verify that.There are ways to find out what to do, but ""Look for people playing the game on YouTube"" is not a substitute for in game info.  Let's say you want your base to have a horizontally-rotating turret with a single gun in it to shoot aircraft; that sounds pretty cool!  *Open build menu* Hmm no turret listed.  Let's try custom cannons.  Nope.  Advanced cannons?  Also nope.  Misc tab? Nope^3.  As a noob you didn't go to  'New Object'->'Two axis turret'->'One Axis Turret'.  But let's say we found that and started construction.  We slap down the main piece and hook up the ammo boxes and other blocks to give us the explodey, armor piercing goodness that we want.  How much of each does your gun need?  Beats me.  Just slap things on&off and figure it out.  Finally, we need our gun to elevate to attack flyers.  Oh look, a block called Elevation Barrel!  How many do I need to hit 60-70 degrees?  Beats me.  You have to slap them on and then either scroll your way back to the firing piece block or just try out the gun to see if you put in enough.Figuring out how to play the game should be a choice of tradeoffs.  I should be asking myself ""Is it worth the resources to have guns that elevates to 80 degrees or is 60 enough?"", and not asking ""How in the gently caress do I get a rapid firing gun that elevates to 60 degrees with alternating explosive and armor piercing shots!?""  The entirety of my issues with the game could be solved with a 'design wizard' that would let me see how the number of parts affects the final stats.  I'm fine with something that let's me see that I need x gauge increasers, y cooldown decreasers, and z recoil dampers.  I'll take it from there and work on fitting them in.  Without something like this, I find that I need to regularly stop playing the campaign mode and go into the designer to get a weapon I want.  I would much rather prefer trying to fit in the parts I know I need under the time pressure of an approaching enemy.Full disclosure:  I have still haven't gotten belt-fed autoloaders to connect properly(They work now!  Details below).Gun stats provided in game: -Max shell diameter: 0.020 -Gun has 1m ammo clip and loaderAmmo stats: -Shell diameter: 0.018 -Clip size required: 1mError message that gun cannot be loaded.Can you guess what the problem is?  If you guessed that the shell was too big to fit in the gun, you're right! (although it beats me how I should have known that)  I reduced the number of shell parts and now it all both fits and tears up the Onyx Watch flyers.If this was helpful, please stay tuned.  I'll happily update the review if things improve.			"

Early Access Review
								!WARNING!This is a long review. The short version is this : The physics aren't right to the point where the AI is the only reliable pilot. Unless the physics are fixed, the game will be unplayable for me. I don't find it fun to design an amazing ship only to watch an AI have fun with it. Unless you are prepared to spend long hours trying to learn the mechanics of this game and brave the incredibly steep learning curve, I would recommend you waiting until the game is developed further. It has great potential, but very serious issues holding it back from being great.1. PhysicsA: BoatsB: Planes2. Tutorials and learning3. User Interface.4. Controls( Note that the other categories I can't cover due to character limits. So what if my review is 17,138 characters long? That's how many characters I need to sum up the experience! So I'll just cover the main issue. )	I've sunk a few hours into this game and I liked the concept. But I didn't realize what that concept really was. I came into this game expecting something like Starmade but with planes and boats. What I got was something very different.1. PhysicsThe main issue I have with this game is the physics. They just aren't right at all. The objects don't behave the way you would expect them to and the forces that act on objects don't seem right at all. Thrust of any kind on even a very heavy object don't seem proportionate. I will try to explain.	A: I first tried to make a boat. After long hours of fruitless experimentation, I found out that boats do not take into account account the amount of air inside of an enclosed space. I experimented on this concept and found that I could have two objects of the same weight but different volumes of air and they floated identically. So this tells me that the volume of air is not being calculated. The weight of the object seemed to be the only factor determining it's buoyancy. Both of these objects had air pumps, I should mention.Initially when I was making my first ship, I thought that it would be best if I start small and aim for a ship that could move quickly. The issue with making these small boats was: Whenever I would put a significant amount of thrust to the back side of the boat, the nose would rise up out of the water almost immediately and the boat would backflip in the air and land upside down in the water. So of course I tried moving the rotors to the front of the ship only to have the same issue. I got very frustrated and added immense amounts of lead blocks to the nose of the vessel and even with more weight than the entire hull of the ship, the nose would rise up out of the water and the boat would capsize. Naturally I gave up on the idea of a fast boat as it was clearly impossible for me. So I moved on to making a sturdy boat that might be able to withstand some punishment as I couldn't seem to move very quickly without capsizing. After a long time I made something that was barely buoyant but I was able to reach about 20 – 24 meters per second without the ship flipping. Even this was only possible with very close attention placed on the 'water drive'. If I pushed it to the maximum, even that would flip it. So I was able to get a ship that weighed 1251.51 go at about 20 - 24 meters per second, which was the fastest I had gone in the water without the ship flipping, but I could not get a ship that weighed 118.75 to go any faster than roughly 6 – 10 meters per second. And even at that speed it would flip. Even with this small victory, there were yet more problems. Now the issue was that I would roll over completely if I wanted to make an even relatively sharp turn. Your ship does not right itself well. Period. It does not act it's weight. What I mean by this is that everything is very 'floaty'. If for example my nose would climb out of the water and I would end up perpendicular to the water ( my ship's nose pointing directly up into the sky ) the ship's nose would fall back into the water at the same speed as the much smaller 118.75 weight ship. As for the rolling of the ship, the same thing is true. Now, if you want to use a cannon, oh boy, you had better hope you're not shooting broadside because if you do, you're rolling! The strange thing that I noticed is that you could be stock still in the water and if you try to turn, nothing happens. This makes sense as the rudder is the only thing turning you, assuming you don't have rotors on either side of the nose of your ship to try to turn you. ( Even those don't seem very effective in my experience.) Now if you get any kind of speed, your ship will start to roll if you try to turn it. It's not as though it's rolling from the force of your speed as it seems to start rolling at 1 meter per second. So you're moving it 1 meter per second and you can completely roll your ship belly up in the water. This does not work in reality. I have been on big ships. It doesn't happen. So it seems like instead of having true ship physics, it feels copy pasted from the plane physics. It's rolling the ship like a plane would with ailerons. So sharp turns in ships would only be possible if you were to use the rolling to your advantage and then attach rotors to the underside of the nose of the ship and the use that to turn yourself, again, like a plane might. But that's not feasible as your nose is likely to be out of the water, and if it isn't already, those rotors on the underside will solve that quite quickly.	B: The next thing were the planes. I struggled immensely with planes. It was nigh on impossible for me to get anything to fly that didn't  act as if it had twenty anvils attached to the tail. Every time I built a plane, it would pull up constantly. It was as though the joystick of the plane was pulled back at all times. I would have to try to push the nose of the plane down constantly just to stay level. It was infuriating. I eventually found something after hours of testing that would sort of work. It was a flat block shaped like a T with wings at the upper ends of the T. The weight almost didn't seem to matter as far as the constant rising problem; As I could make the entire T shape out of heavy metal and it wouldn't make a difference. It would, however, cause the plane to fall more quickly but did nothing to affect it's orientation. As soon as I tried building the T thicker, it would go back to the constant rising.So about the only thing I was able to make with any kind of success was a fortress. Yes, a massive floating piece of metal that barely moved.  With a gun.			"

								donated my few bucks just to see the builder. Its more of a cartoon than a real game in my opinion. Theres no character creator, your a robot, and a ugly cartoon robot at that.The graphics and colors follow that patern too, right out of a comic book. Also like an indy VR game you can see your hands (claws) doing things, but everything is big and clunky, like Minrcraft at sea..lol Those pretty looking ships were being seen from a long distance away, up close they'd look just like they were made in Minecraft, IMO. But I donate to Indy companies all the time on Steam so I did here too. Better luck next time.			"

								If you aren't understanding the tutorial 1hr in and aren't enjoying anything, refund it because it does not change at all. Best advice would be for a demo consisting solely of the tutorial and a free build mode to be released so that people can try before they buy. Game is overly complicated just for the sake of being so. The default controls make the dark souls mouse+keyboard controls look good, the tutorial makes you look at youtube videos to learn how to play rather than doing the job of a tutorial AND TEACHING YOU HOW TO PLAY. Seriously, kerbal space program is about sending stuff into space and does 1000x better at teaching the player how to play as well as makes it engaging, whereas this is a game about building things and making them fight other things and collecting resources. A game about rocket science is less complicated and more fun than a game about building stuff and blowing up other stuff.Suggestions:Make a proper tutorial that spends more time having you build things than it does giving you slideshows with bad camera angles and manual pages to read.Put the fixed tutorial and a free build mode up as a demo so that people don’t waste time and money on something they don’t like.Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who likes building games unless they were looking for kerbal with added layers of complication and dark souls controls.

If the game got a dedicated server or a steam server like other games like this one, I would change the game as a recommended, but for now I don't want recommend this game for this time, it is too early but I will wait until they release the multiplayer in this game.

Well theres a problem with that, no matter how fun a game can be when you understand it, it must be easy to be understood. Who wants to do boring stuff ages and ages before you can have fun? A good game is simple and easy to learn, this game is not easy to learn.

								Cannot recomend, the AI is dumb as ♥♥♥♥, unable to operate guns correctly (Cannons are pointed at the enemy, does not shoot, cannons pointed at water, does shoot.)This completely ruins the campaign for me, the adventure mode comes with a quick ""♥♥♥♥ you"" as you are massacred by super high level ships 10 minutes in.

								I'm just gonna go ahead and recommend you to wait buying this game until a later date when the developers have fixed the issues currently in the game. Some issues are:It doesn't have a proper fullscreenIt doesn't have borderless fullscreenIt doesn't lock your mouse to the game so you will be forcefully alt+tabbed out of the game when you left clickYou have an insane superhuman speed making it difficult to build in creative mode.Your own appendages float around you as you move. wtf is this?At least the game seems like it could fun but these issues gotta get fixed ASAP.

I can't understand the new refinery and how it works to process fuel. so the game is overall not bad for experiance players, but I don't think new players will put time to understand all the new advance parts in the game and new weapons added on with all the EMP weapon options.

								While I'm usually not one for giving up on a game, this one deserved that honor in every regard. A game, which on the surface, looks interesting, unique and frankly deep in its options for creating voxel vehicles fall short a minute into its introduction. Yet the entirely disgusting menu appearance, along with the tutorial that barely explains any of the concepts or mechanics of the game, to then ask you to go through and look at youtube video's to get a hold of the game. (Note to developer: Play Factorio, that game is quite a lot more advanced than this but it was able to make a tutorials that are engaging, challenging without the actual need of cups of frustration.) I'm not even mentioning the awkward controls, the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥building functions, the wobbling and confusing UI, disgustingly ugly textures along with other horrible design choices that makes this extremely hostile towards new players. Do you want to relax and build? Don't buy this game.Once more, when you want your players to watch youtube video's to get to know the basics of the game such as firing the weapons on a ship, you've done ♥♥♥♥ed up.  "

								First off let me say that fanboys will downrate any negitive reviews for this game so expect that. This game isn't worth $20, In fact I gave the gift back to my friend so he could get a refund. For Free I wouldn't play this game. Cons: Seriously Bad Controls for Both Keyboard and Mouse. Confusing GUISharp Learning Curve that will ♥♥♥♥ you off unless you watch all of their tutorials( Mind you there is over an Hour of bad production value videos to watch ) Very bad graphics that makes your eyes bleed.Combat is promoted as this epic enjoyable thing you'll spend hours having fun with but the truth is the games combat is weak at best lacking serious depth and content. Crashes often for Windows 10 users.Sounds were of low quality. Cancer community of butt hurt fanboys who can't see the truth about how bad the game is and if you hate the game the nerd rage you'll recieve for just having your own opinion. ----------------------Pros: Steam Refund still works. =======================DON'T BUY THIS PILE OF GARBAGE=======================DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE TRAIN=======================DON'T LISTEN TO THE FANBOYS=======================Ps: Fan boys, If you don't like my review of the game, DEAL WITH IT! I will just remove your stupid comments and not even read them. This is my opinion of the game, You think otherwise go write your own review and♥♥♥♥♥♥off.			"

								This game looks amazing, runs well, and has a great concept. Sadly, I am not a ♥♥♥♥ing genius. The game is extremely hard and the game mechanics are not explained. There are so many different settings and options and I do not know what they do or how to use them (such as difficulty. The difficulty option is garbage. Instead of easy, medium, and hard mode, it is 0.00-???.) I tried to play but the cannons would not work. I searched the boat for the computer thingy that I saw in a video. Apparently, this thing was very important and turned on the boats AI. I found it but turning on the AI did not make the ship fight back when enemies came by. I also played some other mode where I had to capture a ship but I was killed everytime I got close. I placed a cannon but it did not work so I could not defend myself. I tried to steer to the ship I had to take over but my boat flipped over. I assume that I need to place some sort of ammo container but I could not find one in the inventory. I also noticed that every single object says press Q when you get to it but pressing Q only controls the AI unless you press it on a door. This is garbage and I have requested a refund. Maybe I will buy it when there is more explanation and help added. I am VERY VERY disappointed. I was expecting a fun game about fighting ships and flying vehicles but I got a game harder to control than Kerbal Space Program (and that says ALOT about how difficult it is). I rate 1/10. The 1 is for the good graphics and good music. This game is only fun to watch other people play. A waste of $20. I am very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about this.			"

								Great uninstall simulator. 10/10 Would uninstall againThe developers seriously need to address the insane learning curve that haunts this game. I understand that they are aware of this and are taking measures to combat the situation but more still needs to be done. The game seems like a complete cluster-f**k of huge buttons being thrown in your face right from the start. The UI is clunky and half of your screen is taken up by the GUI when in-game. Even with all of the ""helpful"" tutorials that come with the game it is still hard to grasp the basics. I appreciate that it is in early access but it is still not worthy of the £14.99 price tag. I do enjoy complex games that take a while to master but ""From The Depths"" takes a while just to navigate the menu and controls. The game has a huge potential and i love the concept. Hence the reason that i decided to pick it up. I just hope that the developers can continue to improve their game. Overall i do not recommend the game at the moment and this negative review will remain until the developers do more to address the situation.			"

								Do not get this game until they fix the terrible building controlsPlaying this game feels like a chore, that is, if you want to create things. The combat in the game is very fun, but that is where the potential of this game comes to an end. In order to create even the smallest of boats, one must spend upwards of an hour to make it work properly, and even then you end up with a peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥that can't compete with the workshop blueprints. I feel like this game is unplayable to anybody not willing to spend at least 4 hours learning the mechanics, which sounds easy and tolerable at first, but ends up being a drag. You will buy this game, start it up and then think that for some reason you can jump right on in, and that you don't need to watch the tediously long videos on how to change the direction of a wooden triangle. You will start to build a boat, then halfway through get frustrated and go back to watch the videos, you will then repeat this process around 4 times within the first hour of the game.It is so frustrating that you start to get stressed, not a good stressed like facing a boss in dark souls, but the type you feel when you have an essay due in an hour and you haven't started it. I feel like the one and only reason this game is getting good reviews is that people don't want to admit that they can't build anything amazing so they act like the game is simple.All in all, if you buy the game stick to using other peoples stuff and actually play the game, don't spend hours attempting to learn the building basics that are on par with the difficulty of the blender software.

								3/10I saw all the pretty little screenshots and thought wow this must be an amazing building/combat game!!!BOY was i ♥♥♥♥ing wrong.1: the learning curve on this is ASTOUNDING. There are extensive tutorials for this game, but the tutorials throw you right into a MASSIVE builder, which is literally EVERYTHING you can build. Seriously? you just expect to us to comprehend all of that info?2: The combat is awesome... IF you or the other person knows what the hell they are doing. I see this game as a more advanced toribash.3: The limited amount of experienced players are mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S. I came across one guy who i had asked for help while we were battling. He taught me how to make a neat ship, it was a tiny little raft with one cannon. His ship literally steamrolled my ship. Did i mention how this game works? which finally brings me to my next point...4: BIGGER = BETTER. If your ship is the size of a planet, chances are the other guy's game will crash or he will be destroyed by the shear massiveness of the ship. For example, There was a ship i came across called the ""titanic battleship"" Sounds really impressive right? if you like a ship that is basically a giant ram. No matter where you came at the ship from, you would destroyed. For a noobie at a game like this, there are SUPER simple changes that could MASSIVELY improve the game. Like seperating the building portion into three parts, Boat, Air, Space.			"

								The building in this game is good especially the keyboard controlls BUUUUT  the way you stear the vehicle is bad. Maybe if they attached the character to the wheel would be best and using the normal controls for steering. Instead you just have to be on the vehicle and it uses different keys on the keyboard. The game controls are so cluttered that any new person has to drown in video tutorials to understand how to do anything. Also the UI is crap and WAY overcomplicated. you can build your own engine and guns is really cool but the menues and UI tries throw so much information at you that it becomes too much. Final gripe here is the bots. In first person there is this limb clipping where if you turn the arm turns before the head and you can see detachment which is annoying. They also have poor models and textures. Finally their movements are too wild in and the ability to fly and survive under water ruins the feel of the game.TLDR summery: controls are very bad, UI is very bad, player model is TERRIBLE, way too much learning and not enough playing, building is cool.This game has SO much potential and perhaps by release it will be one of my favorites but until then I reccomend you skip over this one for now.

								-Controls were designed by many-armed moon-men-UI is a mess-Not enough room for all the buttons on a 2000x1000 computer screen-Building is convoluted-Experiance could be likened to being thrown into a cage with bright stobelights on all sides and thumbtacks all over the ground+If you can figure out how any of this game works, you just might have a marvelous timeIn the right hands I believe 'From the Depths' could have considerable potential, but as mentioned above, said hands probably belong to some strange alien that communicates with smells and has eyes on it's palms. Though you can probably achieve impressive things with From the Depths, you will first have to understand it; I could not, and I suspect a great many people could not either.If in future the dev hires a human interpreter to help him better understand how to make a game that humans can understand, then this review should be disconsidered.

								Well, it's a leading contender for worst interface design, that's for certain.  I suspect there's a good game buried under here somewhere, but it's nearly impossible to penetrate the unintiutive controls in order to find it.  Ultrawide and superwide resolution users beware:  the world rendering is horz+ but the HUD is vert-, which produces... frustration.  To put it mildly.If you're on the fence, I suggest you leave this one in the oven for several more months.			"

I spent all that time trying to deal with the controls, which made zero sense by the way, in tutorials, and then the thing made me take a stupid quiz on them? just. dude. I want to build. and if I can figure out how I'm going to change the controls to something less stupid. is there a button that just says ""okay, screw this crap and let me build?"" because I couldn't find  it. Didn't spend much time looking, admitadly but I shouldn't really have to. It should be there, on the screen, not hidden behind a million freakin buttons that seemingly give you zero choice. I was simply after a relaxing experience of building stuff and maybe blowing stuff up, why I got was a headache.			"

The concept is great. but the gameplay itself is lacky. Field of view is crazy wierd, and to even think i could build something let alone a ship like this is beyond my capabilities. I bought this game with 20 euro. A 20 euro that i did not know the value of at the time. 20 euro i could have used to buy a better game. As you can see, i have only 16 minutes at this game, but it is enough to not recommend this. When i first saw how bad this game was, the refund system was not introduced.

								Build your own vehicule (submarines, ships, planes, spaceships, ...) with blocks and fight the others, would be funny if the early access was not a bit too early. Because every main aspect of the game is not finish and all frustrating.First, let's build something. Anyway you dont have choice since this is the only thing you can do at first. So let's try ! Yeah, let's more see the video first looks a bit complicated. Beacause yes, a 1 hour video can quickly teach you how to do (I never thought one hour could both look so long and go so quick). You move the cursor with arrows, and click to place stuff (shouldn't it not be the contrary ?!). First surprise, the notion of ""forward"" depends on where you looking at ! Yeah, because nobody remember where is forward on a ship ... You have many keys, each one changing something and managing to not make building easier. Then, what to build ... there are hundreds of blocks. How is it possible ? Because many of them are useless copies of the previous ones ! Angle block just to make it look better, longer block for ... I don't know, isn't the main objective of blocks that everything is build of single same size blocks ? A good surprise, engines and weapons are complex pieces with many quite logical parts to tune it (like a canon with ammunitions, automated loaders). But some other are not: the engine is a complex part where everything must be conected, but helixes can be placed anywhere and magically get the power ! Anyway, I couldn't make neither my engine or canon work, so let's skip for the missions which magically unlocked.One aspect I forgot is that when you build your ship, water magically goes through it. Let it be clear, a boat for full of water sinks. Wood is slightly lighter than water, but with all the metal stuf like canons, it sinks. A boat only floats because of the air inside, like a baloon. So why here it doesn't think even if half of the bocks are the engines and the canon ? because the wood is as light as polystyrene ! So now, a polystyrene boat is not stable. So you need to put lot of lead under it to stop waving everywhere ! Boat do have a stabilizer, but it's not supposed to be heavy, just large to avoid lateral movement by friction. And friction is something this game totally forgot. So, now I have a fast boat, and I need to go somewhere. Let's have fun and crush into a big boat. I pushed the heavy polystyrene gallion on the side, then due to collision bugs we both started sinking, then physics rembered we are made of polystyrene so we start going upward, while friction kept not existing so we both accelerated, then finally out of water we jumped hundreds of meters high is the air, and then felt back in the water as deep as we were, and go on ... Next mission, I have a boat with cool saws on it and I need to destroy anither gallion. First surprise, my view is inside the ship, so I cannot see anything ! I found a way to have an outter view but the boat is too far. Next try, I hit the boat, but once I go deeper inside it falls on me and I cannot move. Tens of tries later and after adding saws on the boat, I destroy the right side of the gallion, make the bottom totally explode (it says I destroyed 40% of the ship) ... And the gallion is still floating like a piece of polystyrene. I had to destry 70% of it, and I never could make it because of stupid physics and collisions, and other ships firing at me.Other mission, on one plateform, few canons to use to defend, never could fire with one. Another one, the boat goes so fast it cannot turn. When I see the IA driving the planes like a sick ostrich, It says a lot about the playability. And I didn't talk about the useless robot you control and sinks deep in the water each time you lauch the building mode, or the fact that the games doesn't pause while building the so the boats keep waving everywhere and the parts you cut fall in the ship without anyway tot ake it back. Clever.So let's face it, this game is not finished, does not worth the 20€ it asks, neither the 8€ I paid in sold. Building anything is light year from the playbility of any minecraft-like game. The two main elements which make a boat go, the air inside and the friction, are totally absent. Driving anything will only bring you frustration. Looks funny on the paper, looks like many people already have fun on it, but right now it's too unfinished to even be called an alpha.			"

								After going to the forums to discuss issues I was having with the creative direction the game was taking (Removing features, implementing repeated unnecessary ideas, general things that made me worry that the game was suffering from ""Perpetual alpha syndrome"") I met with the Reply of the creator, Nick Smart.I tried to offer Nick constructive crticism, I told him his team was talented and that I was worried about the game experiencing alpha problems that will prevent a proper release of the game as it is advertised and described. He proceeded to directly insult me and insintuate I was a loser for spending so much time test playing his game for him. (Why did I pay you money again?)So, The game is experiencing a lot of problems; but the bigger problem is I don't know if the problems will be fixed or even cared about or viewed as problems because of lack of professionalism in Nick Smart. What I do know is that they are removing advertised features to streamline code on a very unstable game that slows down and crashes frequently for many, meaning that it can no longer be described as a sandbox strategy game in any but the ""mobile strategy style"" sense. It is still a sandbox game, but not as described on steam because they have definitively given up on certain design goals. They should update their advertisement to reflect this or reform their design goals.The company is obviouly lacking an end goal for WHAT this game wants to be, and they have no plan for addressing this problem. Because of this I am afraid it will never Leave Alpha. While this is a fun sandbox with some customisation, the game concept experiences too much turnaround as newer and increasingly poorer ideas get added far too frequently. By nailing so many additions to the game concept, they are splitting the game into coding and conceptual splinters. It is almost like they are willing to break their game in order to push it further toward a theoretical release that I honestly don't see coming.Buy this game if you want to have fun in an alpha application where you design cartoonish boats that don't obey physics, Don't expect much else, especially if what you expect is professional courtesy from Nick Smart; who frankly is unlikely to  get any more of my business after this venture. This is not ""Early access"" in my opinion, this is a ""broken game"". Buyer beware, if you must buy, wait for a 75%+ sale.This is a soft no for me, if the designer learns from his mistakes before it is too late, this game may have a future. I am totally willing to change my review if they learn to listen when half their forums hate major changes(Why ask for input if you are not going to take the input?). Though my position on the managment issues will likely remain.P.s. Hey Nick, thanks for reminding me to review your game in your forum tag. I would have totally forgotten otherwise.Very Smart of you.P.P.S. After posting this review, I have proceeded to be harassed by both the creator and his fans repeatedly over the span of several weeks. This is pathetic, unprofessional behavior and I hope to never do business with this company EVER again. I am amending my review, Because of the Behaviour of Nick Smart, His Employees, and his flying monkey-like forum troll fans this is now  a Hard NO. I cannot support business practices like this, even if the game were perfect, which it certainly damn isn't.TL:DR If I could still get a refund I would. Instead of taking criticism they lash out at paying customers, F*ck That. If you have to play this game, Well...""There be pirates aplenty on the seven seas."" Don't pay these jerks.			"

								Obvious problem whit the game is its price, its too high for a indie game what is in alpha. It should be max 10 Euros, instead being almost 20.Detailed Review:+ Realism (boat dynamics, eg too many blocks on one side can cause ship to roll over)+ Content(many blocks whit unique uses, boat engines are quite detailed, you can build Vessel, Aircraft or skyfortress+ Graphics look somewhat unique, they may seem bad for a person who is crazy about graphics quality, but they are better than minecraft ones- Gameplay time. After 10 minutes ingame it can get boring, mostly because of Ugly and bad menu system, i usually play it couple times per week.- Price Its literally too high for this software, it screams for better menuI dont recomend to buy this game for this price, it dosent deserve to be more than 10€			"

								Looks bad and plays bad. In fact it crashed twice in a row when i tried starting it.BUT, Its pre alpha and everything is a placeholder.So its not really a bad game, its just very minimal at the moment and i honestly can't recommend it. It does have great potential to be the next big vehicle construction game now that SE seems to be going the way of ""literally anything published by EA games""So if you want a game to play, wait until they make the controls more user friendly than a microwave that shoots buzzsaw blades at you when you push a button.If you want to support the devs, be my guest, but you wouldn't really get a playable game out of it until much later.Maybe they should have waited a few months to streamline the UI and controls.

If you want a game that you can build blocky creations and then go fight with them go buy robocraft (as much as I hate that game I would gladly play it over this).			"

In a sense this game is a mixture of space engineers and robocraft except you build your own weapons. You can build anything from subs to spacecraft.it is really stable for being in early access and I haven't had any game breaking bugs at all.The weapon creation system is great you can create from a simple machine gun to a massive super cannon. You can build awesome missiles and torpedos and even build lasers!			"

There is little to do outside of the vehicle design and tester gamemode, with the campaign containing bad AI and repetitive gameplay.All in all I cannot recommend you buy this game.

Early Access Review
								Well, after reading so many positive reviews of this game and seeing some vids, I bought this game.The building part of this game is a dream, with having to build your guns and engines from parts and it actually making a difference how you arrange said parts. It is what I always wanted in a game like this, and this part is really brilliantly done.Then I spawned in a large ship to get a feel of how the game actually plays.Uh oh.The controls didn't really seem to do what I wanted and the ship decided to move on its own even after I told it to stop. At some point it got stuck going right for some reason? I could make it stop by holding the appropriate keys but it started moving again when I let go. I couldn't find out why.I started over, spawned in another ship, which seemed to stay somewhat put this time. However I forgot to tick the ""Spawn in vehicle chair"" option so I was somewhere else inside the vehicle. Ok, I'll go find the chair.I tried to make my way through the interior.  Well, let's just say being a moving entity inside a moving entity is something that many games don't get right. Maybe it's a game engine problem, I don't know.I spent 2 minutes trying to walk up a ramp to a door to make my way through the vehicle but I kept getting stuck against whatever and the camera clipping though stuff made it hard to orient in the confined space.This alone was a bit of a turnoff for me. If I constantly have to fight with the controls and camera to do things then I'm just wasting my time instead of making and controlling crazy vehicles. I understand due to the nature of this game that it can't be as smooth and clean as in, say, Minecraft, or even Starmade, but I did expect much better.I may try this game again when it's out of Early Access, as it really comes close to the game I always wanted (which is basically Space Engineers with weapons and engines and stuff actually built out of individual components).

Early Access Review
								This game is a work of art!!! Talk about hard work from the developer. He handles bugs and adds features faster than any other developer listed on steam! My hats off to this guy! Steep learning curve, but thats because there are so many features. This is hands down the best voxel builder game on steam period! There are no other games around where the player can design and program the behavior of custom vehicles like From THe Depths. This game is challenging and the rewards are appropriately awesome. I spent about 17 hours designing a massive battleship with all kinds of weapons and the AI to control it and all the control and behavior blocks work like a charm.... you can build almost anything that you can think of and instead of just sitting there like alot of voxel games including minecraft, these come alive. The community is vibrant and workshop is a great repository of vehicle designs. Also a big plus, many of the top players take time to help people who have questions on how to build/design complex creations. If you post a question on the forumns it will get answered quickly and politely. This is the shining example of everything an early release game should be!!! Its literally light years ahead of the rest. This game can suck you in and reward the player until many hours have past and all you want to do is design ever cooler vehicles and fight the tough AI factions. The more I play the more I want to play. This game does not devolve into a grind or repetition, it evolves into an engaging EMERGENT experience that keeps on giving back to the player. This game is WAY BETTER than most AAA games released in terms of long term engagement. Get it and enjoy it!!			"

								*This game was ok, but they made the construction and mechanical aspects way more difficult and complex than they needed to be. Not that it was hard understanding the technical part, just diffucult to deal with.**Previous review mainly focusing on some aspects that could use clearing up or clarification. I voted down because of some issues with clarification and game response (how you would know what was happening / going on / not going right). One of the devs was kind enough to reply and add a few things to the game. Hid additions have cleared up the confusion of some aspects of building.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*NEW REVIEW (Post update)*This is a very nice game, and will be very fun and interesting for those who enjoy mechanics / auto-mechanics. This game is chock full of posibilities. Whether those posibilities be mechanics, weaponry, vehicles, or design. This game is a true great mechanical sandbox.			"

								Having played over 50 hours I can say that this is one of the most addictive games I have played - the physics engine is the best I've seen out of any crafting game yet, and the sheer freedom to create what you want is beautiful. It's tough, no word of a lie, but when you create your first ship that balances well and can fight effectively it's a great feeling!Nigh-on 10/10. Such a great game!!			"

								Minecraft and Carrier Command had a baby, and this is it.Yes, there is a learning curve, but it's a painless experience; building boats and vehicles in the designer, and practicing against whichever AI you choose to spawn is complex, but fun.  It will probably take you a while to figure out to make a ship, and make it move, but the satisfaction once you do is enormous.  You'll soon be churning out design after design in minutes once you've got the hang of it; and once you've got the hang of it, you can try your hand at the entertaining campaign, which an almost RTS-like / x-com management experience, punctuated by nail-biting, real time battles.Make no mistake, this is a PC gamers' game, old-school and simmy, with a steep learning curve, fiddly controls (at first), but the rewards are deeper than anything you'll find in the majority of games.  Weather you're expressing your creativity, or min-maxxing your builds, watching your creations come to life and SMASH THE **** out of other ships and craft is deeply, deeply satisfying.  It's not a quick-blast, but the kind of game you settle into for months on end.  We're talking Ultima Online and Eve levels of depth here, and that's not a comparison I make lightly.Oh, and in terms of content and stability?  I wouldn't have known it was early access if it didn't say so on the steam page.       Seriously, it's that good.  Patches are frequent, and there is already enough here to keep you busy for months on end.I heartily recommend this game. "

								with the new advanced cannons you can build super-strong cannons for their size and resources! would like to have custom resource gatheres so you can make them more powerfull (more stacks per item so 1 block will make you mine 2 resources so every block would add 1 resource mined per mine-tick) of more effiecent ( more resources per 1 item in the zone) faster speed (it mines faster) for the oil and resource plant! i would like to make GIANT oil rigs. but make them REALLY EXPENSIVE so you cant just spam them.

								Good game with great potential. This game is diffrent form just about any other game i have seen. It has alot to offer, with a near infinate replayability and multi-player (i have not yet tried the multi-player so no comment on how well it works). Realy the only big problem with the game is the fact that when you start the game the learning curve is like rinning head first into a brick wall. The developers are obviously tring to fix this with tutorials built into the game. The tutorials that are built in make it more like running head first into a brick wall with a pillow on your head or a helmet depending on how much time you are willing to spend watching tutorials. the way i attempted to learn the game was by watching a lets play of it and then tring to do the things the guy in the lets play was doing and looking at the ingame tutorials whenever i got stuck. I don't recomend doing that, I ended up losing the game and restarting the campagn 4 times because of it. The only other thing that i think sould be changed is the difficalty right at the beginning of the game the 1st or 2nd enemy you fight is a army of flyers and warships. I think they sould add in A LOT more before that kind of thing shows up it makes the beginning of the game feel rushed and panicked (especially for a new player), and makes the learning curve feel even steeper because it puts you on a time limit to elimination.

Early Access Review
								Best $20 you will ever spent. I have spent over 120 hours just on building viable ships for the campaign. That is more time than I spent on Fallout 4.  I have not even touched the campaign fully because I do not have all the vehicles I need to succeed. If you are a little OCD, you will be obsessed. There are 3 main downsides:Balance is a little up in the air at this point of development. The ships that are your enemies are community made and take advantage of every exploit and imbalance currently present in the game so you will have to build at the highest possible level to make ships of equal size competitive. Second, the AI requires quite a bit of tweeking to have them handle and fight effectively. If you plan to build anything more advanced than a ship, i.e. airships, spaceships, submarines etc. You will have a huge hurdle working with automated control blocks to have them works correctly.Third, if you want to build a non-boat and have it be competitive at the higher block count, be prepared to spend 30+ hours just building a functional, beautiful vessel. You place blocks two at a time with mirroring and to create something of real substance, that is attractive, be prepared for a very, very steep learning curve. Just optimizing one cannon can mean 3+ hours of work. Luckily, there is support for prefabs that you can copy and paste onto the ship. As well, turrets can be copied and pasted as well, but learning the intricacies of making sure they rotate correctly, or are capped correctly, etc is a hurdle to learn.In summation, I have to be very controversial and say that this is a game is on the level of something like Dwarf fortress in possible complexity.  You will have to place many hours to master it. Even after all the hours I have played, I am looking forward to unleashing my perfectly tuned creations on all of the factions of NETER.

								I have to edit this reveiw even though i didnt want to. Thi game is amazing and really fun, however lately it has become laggy to the point i cant run a battle between two big ships. This has just gotten worse over the past few upadates and i have to change my reveiw from positiove to negative. While the core aspects of the game are very well done the horrible optimization ruins what i originally bought this game for, huge massive battles. I used to be able to do this just fine but now, i feel its being bottlnecked by the engine and poor optimization. Im a developer myself but i more do it just between freinds and never plan any releases i will say this. The game needs some serious help. It feels like im playing on my freinds Xp machine again. I dont mean to do this product harm but untill this is fixed and stays fixed i reccomend staying away for a bit or if you think your money helps those devs on the other end buy it now and see how it works for you.

Early Access Review
								This is by far one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a very long time. It gives me the same feeling Minecraft did on that first day. It's packed with content and endless possibilities. Functionality:One of the most powerful aspects of this game is the building system. The game offers two styles for building. One is much like Minecraft, and the other is unlike any game before. You are able to quickly and easily switch between the two by hitting F3. Where one building style lacks speed, the other picks up. Building vast expanses of wood for a ship? Try using the Keyboard mode. Trying to piece together the perfect engine? Use the mouse mode to be more accurate and percise while having full rotational control and snappy movement.Features:All that I have played at the moment is the Co-op campaign with my friend. We are about 15 hours in, and have built several things. The game is packed with tons of menus and features that can be somewhat overwhealming at first. As time goes, you begin to understand every menu and feature and at some point, about 10 hours in, it all clicks. Building becomes quick and easy, the battle events bring pure elation and excitement, and the laid back time between battles allows for you to truly create and expand. The game offers features for both visually focused players, and those who prefer stratergy. With an expansive and massive map, you will easily be able to put hundreds of hours into the game and still create new and exciting builds and fleets.Mechanics:One of the most driving aspects of the game is the adaptability of the physics. You can build almost any creation you wish. From submarine, to ocean liner, flying bases, planes, helicopters, airships, rockets, spacecraft, space stations... It's virtually endless. Even land vehicles are a thing. The physics allow for realistic events, like buoyancy, lift, drag, wind, gravity, and anything else which brings the world together. Building a boat takes a little planning as you must keep it from becoming too top heavy and flipping over. As well, the game tends to automatically create things like windows and various other structures based on block configuration, allowing for beautiful and dynamic builds without extreme effort.Visuals:On the surface, the visuals are simply acceptable. As you become more involved in the game, however, they start to make sense. The islands and ships you encounter, as well as those you build will become ever more beautiful. To account for issues during battle, the game will automatically slow and present awesome 'slow-mo' events to prevent your CPU from exploding. A very clever way of handling massive ship battles and constant explosions. The art style is something like Borderlands, which actually makes the game even better. Landmasses and the world looks more realistic, with your character and ships looking more Borderlandish. This makes the game feel happy, even with the dogs of war howling in the distance.Audio:Possibly the weakest point of the game. It has sub-par audio. Engine and ocean noises are there, but fairly generic. Music during battles is great, and interestingly, there is hardly ever music during peacetime. This doesn't seem to bother anyone though, as it presents a more calm tone and allows the user to focus on building. None of the noises are annoying, even after playing for 6 hours straight. The game audio is acceptable, but should be improved as development extends, which I believe will happen.Conclusion:Do you like building, learning, exploring, growing and being a pirate? Are you an engineer? Do you enjoy Minecraft but want something with a more interactive environment? This game is for you. It offers much more than just Co-op multiplayer as well. There are PVP teams, deathmatches, missions, singleplayer, design (creative) mode and several other game types. If you are looking for something revolutionary and are willing to put a few hours into learning the game, you will not be dissapointed. Whether you want to load your ships with AI and watch them rain hell, or control the weapons yourself and unleash terror upon your enemies, this game is astounding.			"

								I would love it if you read this completely.  I love this game, but there are the most basic settings errors.  First of all there needs to be a toggle for the rounds to be rendered or even placed as entities (or whatever) because i just recently had mu computer break and i now work on my backup, that just so happens to be a hp windows Vista laptop with 4 gigs of ram.  Secondly, can you guys add an auto flatten ability or whatever because when i make a fortress without something holding it in place till whatever makes it fly is built, it will flop around in the water and when the item is built, the fortress comes out tilted when i pull it out of the water and i don't know how to fix it if i can.  Also can there be a setting toggle for waves, reflections, the jumping of the cylenders for engines, and the smoke (and clouds), the reason why i ask this is because in most games these contribute to massinv fps loss, the max i can ever get my laptop to run is around 30 fps and i would like to get more than 10 fps max in From The Depths.  I watch famous youtubers (i think there famous) complain all the time about the amunitions in the clips with the advanced cannons being a major fps killer, like bringing a computer that usually plays From The Depths at 60 fps, in an older version, down to around 20-10 fps or even lower, its like making the computer scream for mercy in my mind.  all i can really think of anf if these things were added or fixed than this game would be really enjoyable on a very sucky computer.

Early Access Review
								I initially posted a very negative review. Now that I understand the game better I’m enjoying it, but I also have more criticisms, which I won’t post here because it is a long and detailed list.At its core, the concept of this game is amazing. There are many unique aspects which are inspired genius. It’s apparent that a lot of thought and a lot of work have gone into the game's mechanics.From my perspective the developer has taken the construction style of Minecraft, minus the landscaping and crafting, and nothing as complicated as red stone logic gates (expect maybe LUA blocks), and combined it with the vehicle design aspect of Kerbal Space Program, with more focus on weapons and defence and less on physics (e.g. no orbital mechanics!).There is an RTS style capaign in which you mine and use resources to spawn the voxel based vehicles you design and have AI pilot them.There is also a first person aspect, as you interact with the world through an avatar, which I believe is superfluous and detracts from the game with unnecessary added complexity, especially considering you can move the camera independantly and still interact in all the same ways without the avatar. On top of that there's a levelling system and a skill tree.It has probably the steepest learning curve of any game I have played, but that's not due to the concept, its due to UI design, controls and at times infuriating camera controls. I spent the first 5 hours or so hating the game. Sheer determination got me through. I still felt I had a lot to learn after 30 hours.I think the game could have broad appeal, but that will ultimately be limited by how well the developer can address the usability problems and simplify the learning curve. The in game tutorials are good, but not detailed enough. I hope links to external videos are removed from the game in favour of more tutorials.As an RTS, there may also be inherent limitations to what can realistically be simulated but I’m confident the developer will work how to balance the game’s performance (without forcing the player to manage that).

								Amazing game, if you loved minecraft you will love this game! Its a little quirky in some of it's features but the ability to move your creations whether it be by thrusters, blades, propellers, etc. is absolutely amazing. Definitely recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a game that just passes time. It has it's challenges for the first few times you play it where you have no idea how to properly build things. But it's troubleshooting and looking at the prefabs (pre-built systems that FTD allows you to build, kinda like a schematic in minecraft) makes it super easy for you to find out how to build them. Plus you can upload / download your / your peers' creations into your own world and import them into the designer, or into your campaign if you have the resources needed!			"

								love the direction this game is going. i absolutly recomend this game if you enjoy 'engineering' style games.imo, it is still lacking the following:-propper ballancing and tweaking of game mechanics. for example, short gun barrels are very innacurate, so the only effective guns need to be stupidly long.-graphics. this has been getting better as the updates come out, but some things like the 1x1x1 wood blocks just look terrible.-campaign is not 'engaging' enough for extended play. it's great for the first 50 hours or so, but after that it's feels a little tedious. perhaps more complex resource management, and more human like enemy ai, would help.

								wow, just wow, i first saw this game when i was just taking a look around steam, and boy let me tell you it was a good find. This game is more than just another voxel game. Its taken a step in a new direction (at least in the way it plays). Its really nothing like other voxel games that really just came out of the minecraft craze, such as starmade and robocraft. Since im a big war buff i enjoy being able to accuratly build a ship, plane, or land vehicle. While the game might be a little buggy, its really stuff you dont notice. This game becomes especially fun when you play with friends, or against them.This game is 10/10 egg whites enjoyable. i recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to build something, that could lead into hours, or sometimes just minutes.

								This game is an Engineer's wet dream. There is almost no limit on what you can build and I like the learning curve. When you're mile long battleship works after toiling with it for hours, it is so rewarding. So many options on anything. This is a game you could possibly replay forever. Every campaign could be different just by using different designs. I will say this game runs horribly as it currently stands. My PC far exceeds even the recommended requirements for this game, yet even medium sized battles only average 12 fps. If they would optimize this game, I would have no problem saying this game is worth $100+ dollars. If you can put up with the low frames and sorry performance, you have yourself an easy buy here.Pros:-Extremely fun-Infinite Replayability-Rewarding learning curve-Build anything and watch it fight for you-Large variety in enemies and their respective tactics-Easily worth the priceCons:-Extremely low FPS, even on high end PC with lowest graphic settings			"

My first ship was a complete and utter disaster then after about 2 prototypes it worked so i then built a MASSIVE batleship and thought ""this isnt big enough"" so i built one 3 times the size it had 24 main guns 6 secondaries and 8 tirshiaries (not sure of how it is spelt) then advanced cannons came out and i modernized it. now it has 8 main guns (15QF MarkI) and 10 AA guns (3QF MarkI) also it has been reclassed as a battlecruiser and it is not done yet.Ok I will be quiet while you buy the game.JUST GET IT ALREADY STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT.

								One of the most addictive and fun games I have played in a long time.This game turned out to be a nice surprise to me as I very nearly didnt buy it and even when I did the steep learning curve almost put me off. If you are looking for a quick jump in and play without using your brain this is probably not for you but if you enjoy a game that you can tinker and play with your designs for hours to get them just right and enjoy a bit of complexity then Im sure you will enjoy it.The interface takes a bit of getting used to and you currently need to spend some time in the forums and on youtube figuring alot of the stuff out as things like engine design, weapons and even just figuring out how to build a ship that doesnt float like a brick or a plane that wont fly straight takes alot of practice. Stick with it and you will soon find yourself putting out better and more complex designs in no time. Just be aware this game is a massive time sink and I have found myself getting stuck into a design and before I realise it 8-10 hours have passed and I still have ideas to try.As an early access I am really enjoying it and cannot wait to see it improve even further !

The absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥building system has put a huge barier between me and being able to enjoy this game.Many people reading this may be thinking ""this guy just has no idea what he is doing"" and that is in part true i can admit i have jno idea how the AI works and very little idea as to how to get it work but when your game uses TAB and WASD to ♥♥♥♥ing rotate blocks i assume you were on LSD when you designed the damn thing. There is little to no tutorial on what any of the other keys on your keyboard do other than a very basic tool tips menu on the bottom left of of the screen and from what i can tell none of the keys are rebindable and if they are they arent easily rebindable.I know im going to love the game once i can get used to its ♥♥♥♥ING TERRIBLE building system but for now all i can say is a tip for the developers is to take a hint from starmades building system because it might teach them a thing or two.

								I love this game. It has lots of things to do and it's gameplay is really fun however this game has the largest learning curve i have ever encountered, It took me hours to learn how to build a cannon, just a cannon! nothing else. The gameplay is good i love watching two fleets fight each other but the game has some performance issues such as sudden frame rate drops, physics breaking and some random bugs in general. This game is really good if you are willing to learn the ropes and look past the problems as the devs  said they would soon add mulicore processing which would be an amazing thing to have.I would recommend this game to those who have a lot of spare time and enjoy building games like the kerbal space program.

								Highly enjoyed my time so far. If you like games with depth and breadth, you may very well like this one. So far I've been content just to explore the many ways that vehicles can be configured, from engine designing to AI engineering (there's LUA scripting possible via the AI 'controler') for control of targeting, fire control, and maneuvering--quite a bit of possibility there. My advice would be to follow the designers' suggestion and learn to use the keyboard controls to build; much faster once you have it down. I hope the games grows in popularity.			"

								I really love this hard to learn. Near impossible to master yet still incredibly fun, the game is optimised enough to work on my 260 pound laptop and has good physics, the NAI (Narrow Artificial Intelligence) is good and built in a modular way as to give an advantage to those who build interior. It has some of the clever established sandbox tools I wish starmade had for instance the shrink cubes and fill options. The game allows you to select graphics on startup so even on a poor pic you can select the low res options without lagging your way through a title screen. Those with laptops simpler to the one I had 2 years ago should understand.  Thumbs up from me			"

								Best voxel based building game there is, bar none. The developer is also extremely involved - Just check their official forums. He posts frequently, updates the game frequently, and seems not only passionate about the game, but passionate about the community around it.It's a little bit daunting to start the game due to the scale you can build things up to. Stick with it, and you'll be building gigantic battleships that shoot more missiles than in an episode of Macross.			"

								Very Brief Summary: Obligatory Minecraft reference - using blocks to build ships, planes, spacecraft, floating fortresses and really really really stupidly big guns that may or may not look rather phallic.Important Points:* The install size is very small, and the game is very stable and smooth. Loading times are minimal.* Your constructions will not wobble! Even as they're being shot to pieces, flying through the air or diving across the rolling waves, your creation will not wiggle and the parts will not look like the glue hasn't dried. Once you stick it together, it behaves like a proper, solid object.* The physics are robust. Whether you're ramming another warship, or just trying to make one that doesn't sink the moment you put it in the water, you can rely on the physics to make sense.* The combat is fantastic, whether you're manually aiming a weapon or leaving it up to AI modules that don't actually suck. Imagine Homeworld's colourful, trail-filled battles with Eve's general ship control, but with the added bonus of being able to walk around your ship and man the guns yourself.* You will spend too much time in this game, and neglect your wife/job/personal hygeine.Important features:* Comes with a huge list of pre-built vehicles, from tiny submarines to flying fortresses.* Weapons systems that can be customised in painstaking detail - if you want, you can build a cannon that runs the entire length of your ship, or an automated missile turret with 20 laser-guided missiles.* Single missions that act like challenges, which can be played with default vehicles or your own creations.* A campaign mode that's like one big RTS game, where all the units and structures can be designed by you.* The game is full of tooltips, documentation, visual examples and prefabricated components.

								A great game. I happily spend dozens of hours building ships to conquer the world. Content-wise, it's very good for an early  access game.The UI could really use some polish, and poor optimization leads to low framerates.Luckily, the developer, Nick Smart, is very active on the forums, and the most recent patch improved framerate by around 50%.

								WARNING: this game has a quite steep learning curve!Also one could call it a trial and error simulator.Now with that out of the way, once one actually gets to grips with the mechanics the game is awesome. I'd describe it as a combination of Space Engineers, Supreme Commander and probably some Kerbal Space Program for the physics.This allows you to wage an rts war on the scale of Supreme Commander with custom built units. These units are build like in Space Engineers, from many blocks. However, it is more complicated as something as simple as an engine already consists out of several different blocks placed together. The way these blocks are placed together also has an effect on the efficiency and power output of the engine, a similar system is in play with the weapon systems.Then there is the physics system, which reminds of KSP as it takes placement of thrusters and weapon recoil into account. This in turn allows for some amazing builds and systems.Example of things I have build so far:-frigate-submarine-battleship-propellor plane-jetfighter-balloon airship-wooden satelite-wooden rocket to get to space to build said satelite-artillery cannon that can shoot beyond the borders of the battle map-floating castle-spectre gunshipCurrently wheels are not yet fully implemented, so i haven't build any ground vehicles yet.Pros:-ability to build massive battleships AND use them against enemy forces-semi RTS style gameplay with 100% custom build units-very expansive list of possibilities, leaving new things to learn even after many hours of play-devs listen to the communityCons:-steep learning curve (not really a con for me, but i'll list it as a con anyway as it can well be considered as such)-massive battles on any pc will lag			"

								love the direction this game is going. i absolutly recomend this game if you enjoy 'engineering' style games.imo, it is still lacking the following:-propper ballancing and tweaking of game mechanics. for example, short gun barrels are very innacurate, so the only effective guns need to be stupidly long.-graphics. this has been getting better as the updates come out, but some things like the 1x1x1 wood blocks just look terrible.-campaign is not 'engaging' enough for extended play. it's great for the first 50 hours or so, but after that it's feels a little tedious. perhaps more complex resource management, and more human like enemy ai, would help.

								This and KSP are the best early acess titles i ever played. this game is the regular block building game everyone and their dogs are making, but oh wait! this one has the following features:Complex building: you have to build engines in a certain way to make them powerfull and efficient, you can fully customize your weapon systems, and each thing you make is challenging. expect to spend hours building ships. even a small ship can take 1 hour+, because you have to setup the AI, pimp the ship, airship, plane, or spaceship, to make sure it will work.Why does it need to work? because of the Campaing!thats right, this game has a challenging campaing, wich is played in a rts style way. it has fog of war, so you need to build radars to see the enemy. you can order your units to go to a certain place, and the world is freaking HUGE. expect to spend several hours to finish the campaing. and its great to launch the behemoth that took you 12 hours to build into the campaign, and see it absolutely destroying the enemy! Theres also a campaing editor, where you can make your own world and customize the factions! so it has endless replayability!Overall, this is one of the most fleshed out EA titles on steam, far from dogshit like starforge. buy it.

								This game is simply awesome. You need time in the begining, but then the mighty wow kicks in after a few hours. I spent around 1000hrs on this only getting it on steam like last week ago. This game is the exception to all the early access crap that give it a bad reputation, the developer is constantly updating the game adding new features requested by the community on nearly a daily basis now. the playerbase has nearly doubled in 1 month. You can't absolutely go wrong with purchasing this if u like building stuff that shoots or explodes or lasers or chainsaws... its ridiculous how much time you can spend on designs. Theres also tournaments:

								A very complete ship/plane/flying steampunk airship building and combat game. The building UI takes some time getting used to, but otherwise quite robust when you learn the keys. Its only real weakness are barebones single player missions, but they are playable and have great potential. The conquest mode on the other hand is very fun as you take resources and land from warring AI factions with your own custom designed air and sea force.Compared to say space engineers, this game is much more combat focused. With mutiple weapon systems such as custom guns, Missiles and torpedos big and small, and laser weapons. Unlike space engineers almost every behavior from your craft's movement to its weapons behavior can be programed customly. You can make a craft the snipes at the enemy with cruise missiles, or charges in and smashes the enemy with huge cannon.If spending hours building a flying Missile guided Dreadnought out of blocks sounds fun to you, this early access game is a good pick up. If you don't like building, you might not like this game.			"

								Think of games like: Minecraft, Space engineers and StarMade add them up and you get From the Depths.I will try and keep this review short.I can recommend this game for people who likes the games I said about at the start. You create Boats, Submairnes, Planes, Heilcopters, Castles and Forts, Space Ships and anything that you can think of. The way it looks is like BorderLands/MinecraftThe game has a few modes: Single Player story mode, Muiltplayer, and vehicle desginer.Vehicle desginer is my fav part of the game, you load up in the open world and make your transport or Fort. You need to think about a lot of things while making your 'thing' Water placement, air drag and water drag. Making it off balance, making the angle of the armour right to make the shells bounce off. All in all the physics are 10/10When you are happy with the thing you made now time to test it out in combat. Battles can last from only a few seconds ending with a well placed shot into there ammo or fuel bay ripping the ship in half and watching it sink into the sea. Or they can go on into the hours with two or more well designed ships going at it. Moments like that are enjoyable.In the vehicle Designer you can spawn in a number of diffrent enemeys with many factions, having a huge battle with boats, planes and heilcopters.Im happy with the money I spent on the game, and am very much looking forward to what the game turns into in the future. 8.5/10			"

Whether playing in campaign mode and sorting out how to build something to take out a whatnot or in sandbox building mode and creating ships with limits set only by you this game delivers well for an early access game.

								NOTICE: This review was written during the alpha stage of the game.Do you like games like space engineers where you get to build machines and fight with them? Then this is your gameDo you like to drive boats and fly planes? Then this is your game.Do you like RTS games? Then this is your game.But seriously. This game will eat your life.You can build anything from submarines to spaceships. I even built an ICBM launching seacrawler with LASERCANNONS!!!Now to the actual review.Once you jump in the game you will immediately notice what is going on behind the menu. Those are actual ships from the game, fighting each other. At first you are locked from the campaing and only get to play around with the vehicle designer and story missions, which is not a bad thing. You will be spending most of your time in the designer anyway. Designer is more like a creative mode where you get to spend as much resources as you want and it is a good way to design ships with no fear of enemy attacking you, unless you want them to. Story missions however are small scenarios. There are a few story missions which unlock some blocks for you, so you want to do those as soon as possible. But BEWARE. Story missions are NOT easy.In the campaing mode you gather resources, build your armada, fight the enemy and do some politics. Not much politics. Mostly bribing. But it plays like an RTS game. You select your units and move them in the map. You build radar arrays to remove the fog of war. You build fortresses which gather resources and build you more ships. You can even automate shipbuilding to some extent. I've played the campaing for 12 hours now, and I only hold 1/4 of the map, with the most dangerous enemies yet to come. So campaing will take time.If you've read this far I have to warn you. The game has a very steep learning curve. It does have ingame tutorials, but they do not cover everything. Best advice: Read the descriptions on the blocks.And lastly the positives and the negatives:+ Freedom+ It is in alpha and works better than many released titles the days+ It doesn't really lag, it just goes into slow motion+ Helpful community+ Fully configurable AI controlled drones, weapons, ships and pretty much everything ( if your AI controlled plane decides to ram a mountain mid-battle, it's your fault not your planes.)+ All factions and their lore are community made. The dev chooses which ships to take from community made ships.+ A nearly perfect mix of building, fighting and RTS+ It has multiplayer+ Very steep learning curve (Keeps you interested, but also + GIGANTIC SPACE LASER STATION WITH INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES AND A FRICKING HUGE CANNON WITH EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS AND SUPERFAST FIRERATE THAT HAS SHIELDS AND A CRAB ON THE TOP...Negatives:- Very steep learning curve (it's also a positive, but might scare newcomers)- Some content is locked behind story missions- AI needs better tutorials ( Again this is alpha)Conclusion:If you want a good allround game with building, fighting and strategy then buy this game. It is alpha but you don't really notice it ingame. If you get stuck and don't know what to do, go to the forums and ask. The community is really helpful and might even download your vehicle blueprint, fix it and send it back to you, all while telling what exactly you did wrong.10/10 Would let the AI ram my plane to the side of a mountain while chatting with a friend.

								From the Depths has been one of the most rewarding games I have ever played. It is rewarding because there is a lot of complex aspects of the game that take time to learn, but once you learn them, you kind of feel like the master of the universe. Seriously, when you build a ship that only uses 1000 blocks, and that 1000 block ship can take out a 7000 block monster ship, you will sit back and make those two ships fight over and over and you will be just as excited the 100th time you duel them as you were the first time.My most favorite thing about the game is that it is such blank canvas. You can create and design your war death machines any way you would like. The sky is the limit (well actually space is the limit, yes you can build space craft). SO many possibilities. My style is typically extremely fast small craft with only one large weapon mounted to them, think of my ships and aircraft as fast gun carriers. But that is just one of thousands of possibilities. Some people like to re-create EVE Online ships. Some folks like to build battleships that are so huge it takes them weeks to do so. I love to just download other people's designs and have a look at all the crazy things people come up with. I always come away with new cool ideas to integrate into my designs when I do this.So, the learning curve. Yep, it’s there, and it’s steep. It is not impassable though. Like other games in this genre you will have to put in a little work in order to learn it. Post questions on the forums (fantastic community there by the way), watch Youtube videos, have a look at the wiki...those kinds of things. The in-game tutorials are getting better and better, so you may not have to do quite so much homework as you did a year ago.If you are reading this, then you must at least like building games or sandbox games. If that describes you, then this is definitely the game for you.			"

								Just to start this off, I think this game is good, kinda.I suggest this game, but not for the actual shape, i feel like right now is not even close on how it needs to be to be a really good game, but i think that with time and hard work, this game can become a milestone.Here's my thinking, something that most of the similar game's, like Space Engeneers and Planet Explorers, dont have really good combat mecanics, or dont have it at all.Where come's the problem? The problem on my point of view in From The Depths is that this game lacks really hard on the building, on S.E. u can build pretty much whatever u want, with connections betwen more viecles, and moveble parts, or like on P.E. where u dont have, for the shaping, the classic pick the slope or cube or triangle or whatever, u can shape your creation how u most like, those 2 are really awesome features, that F.T.D. miss, i think that making something more like a fusion of the tree of them would make a really awesome game, for now F.T.D. is not something i would buy, even if i allready did, but for the future, it will mostlikelly become a really good game, or even awesome. Just wait and see!			"

								A really beautiful game. I wish we could give a more detailed point rating then just yes/no.I´d give this game a 12/10 (yes, that´s 12 from 10 points) rating if I could.Esp. in the beginning it is time consuming to learn how everything works together.For example, you can build cannons out of modular blocks which add different kinds of boni/mali to the cannon and even build the ammo for it out of different blocks.Sound really complicated? At first you get that impression but everything is very logical and the more you learn the more you can expirement and finetune your systems.I´ve downloaded some blueprints and took a good look at them to get some pointers and new ideas, that really helped me a lot.Updates are slow but steady, remember there´s only one guy coding this game and with all the stuff going on ""under the hood"" it isnt so easy to implement new things.Would definately buy again!

								From the depths is an AMAZING game considering its alpha state. It has a construction engine similar to Space engineers, IE placing blocks of various materials to form a structure, objects such as generators and engines to give power to items such as propellers, jets, etc. (Though it has more useful features like mirror, fill, position and free flying around the vehicle)Everything is very logical and fairly intrinsic, but moreso is that each section of your crafting menu with a complex object (IE an engine, gun, AI system) has a nice little tutorial that you can select and walk through section by section.This game as an immensely complex crafting system, and the sheer number of options are daunting, but take your time just fussing around with things and checking the tutorial when you get confused, and it's pretty easy to learn and very fun to see what you can come up with. But even MORE fun to pit your creations against others.Ultimately this game is extremely fun for a tinkerer such as myself, considering that I not only get to build all kinds of curious war machines, but you actually get to test them against enemies as well. There are even unlockable items via story (Challenge) missions, and a RTS-esque campaign of using your custom built army to dominate a map filled with several factions of varying allegiance and attitude towards the player. On top of that your charater gains levels and has equipment and skills that can be unlocked, though currently some are not implemented entirely.As it stands, this game is simply amazing with its current features, and quite fun. But the even moreso is the potential of the game.Look up ""Budkai (1,2,3,etc)K tournament"" on youtube for an awesome, action filled example of what the game has to offer. You should find several tournaments where player machines (Controlled by AI) fight to the death!			"

								This game is an Engineer's wet dream. There is almost no limit on what you can build and I like the learning curve. When you're mile long battleship works after toiling with it for hours, it is so rewarding. So many options on anything. This is a game you could possibly replay forever. Every campaign could be different just by using different designs. I will say this game runs horribly as it currently stands. My PC far exceeds even the recommended requirements for this game, yet even medium sized battles only average 12 fps. If they would optimize this game, I would have no problem saying this game is worth $100+ dollars. If you can put up with the low frames and sorry performance, you have yourself an easy buy here.Pros:-Extremely fun-Infinite Replayability-Rewarding learning curve-Build anything and watch it fight for you-Large variety in enemies and their respective tactics-Easily worth the priceCons:-Extremely low FPS, even on high end PC with lowest graphic settings			"

								174 hours later, I regret nothing.Voxel survival games generally disagree with me on one major point: Mining.  I hate mining.  I hated in in EVE Online, in FFXIV, in Runescape, even in Minecraft, which can at least claim to offer some solace from the monotony by throwing in procedurally generated caverns and dungeons and such.  Starmade was promising for me, but unfortunately, the first thing you build in a Starmade campaign is - you guessed it - a miner.  Space Engineers made it prettier, but more complicated and ultimately just as boring.  Even Elite: Dangerous has mining, not that it forces you to participate in it, but still.Apparently somebody who developed FtD felt the same way and decided that resources should be acquired not by shooting at rocks but by capturing and defending points.  The mining gets done automatically, so you can be elsewhere doing other things while still getting all the materials you need for your next vehicle.  This is brilliant.  Obviously it's less of a skill-based mechanic (I guess you can be good at mining?) and more of a time-based one, but this makes sense for a real-time strategy game, which From the Depths most definitely is.On a macro level, the combat in From the Depths is similar to hybrid turn-based/real-time strategy games like Ogre Battle.  Once built, your vehicles can be moved off the board and replaced by simple sprites.  The point of this is to accelerate the game clock and allow you to move your vehicles across the map in seconds rather than days.  Of course, your enemies can do this too, so you need to consider visual range or else you might accidentally bump right into an enemy fleet that you'd rather avoid at the moment.  FtD has the potential for grand strategy campaigns, though currently the installed campaign is big but simple.The combat really shines on a micro level, though.  Vehicles conform to realistic physics.  Ships can float by the buoyancy of their materials (like wood) or by airtight pockets of ballast.  Too much weight on the top of a ship will cause it to capsize, or tilt one way or another.  Put your propulsion blocks off-center and you'll spin rather than turn, or dive rather than push forward.  When you've got everything perfect, that's great - but what happens if somebody blows a hole in your starboard ballast?  Combat is ultimately about exploiting the physical weaknesses in your opponent's vehicle while making yours as failproof as possible.  And there's certainly a lot of ways to make failure happen.  Customizable cannons with armor-piercing shells and penetration-fused explosives?  Check.  Depth charges and torpedoes?  Check.  AI-controlled drone vehicles launched from a mothership?  Check.  Laser-guided missiles, laser-assisted flak cannons and just your typical face-melting lasers?  Czech.  I think the best part of this game is arguably the hundreds of hours you could spend just learning to craft and perfect the weapon you need to counter a specific threat, or a variety of threats, and then dropping it on the deck of your ship before running into an enemy cruiser.If there's just one problem with this game, I'd say that the sound effects can get awfully monotonous.  I don't need to hear the water plunging sound every time I put my camera beneath the waves.  Before Advanced Custom Cannons came around, every cannon shot, big or small, played exactly the same sound effect.  Now the pitch varies based on the size of the cannon, but it's just the same .wav played faster or slower.  I'd like sound effects for engines, cannons, missiles, et cetera, to be moddable in-game so that I can put a real 20mm cannon sound behind my gatling guns.  That would be pretty neat.The other problem is that the multiplayer, like other voxel games, is hosted by players.  There's no matching queue for formal PvP.  There's ""tournaments"" but what this entails is putting a bunch of designs on a map and turning on their AI.  It's hard to call this PvP when it's effectively the same thing as hitting Autocalc in a Total War game.  The developers have been busy adding excellent and much-needed content, so it's not like I expect that they'll crank out a MOBA-style multiplayer mode in the next month or two, but it feels like the game is missing PVP (aside from the kind that will get you kicked out of a player-hosted server).  But I guess that's something that I can look forward to.If you like mining, you might not like this game.If you like Starmade, Robocraft, Space Engineers, World of Warships, or just blowing things up with a cannon, you'll like this game.

								Watched dozens of How-To videos, tried countless different designs and concepts but I can't even produce anything even remotely functional. Even building a basic boat or plane is an exercise in futility. Either the learning curve is massive or I'm making some crucial errors that I haven't yet found. Either way, this game should do better to explain its mechanics to players so they don't feel so inclined to uninstall the game on day 1.			"

Early Access Review
								There's a Tl;Dr at the bottom for the lazy among us.  This is one of ""those"" games. It's complex, deep and rewarding but also approximately as welcoming as a brick wall to new players. To give you an idea, the default control scheme needs a video tutorial from the developer in order to make sense. Are you scared by that? Good, 'cause you should be, that's an intimidating intro to a review. However, it's not as bad as it sounds.   While the systems can be a bit impenetrable at first without some help there is plenty of help to go around. There's a big community of people willing to answer questions on the forums, video tutorials covering basically every aspect of the game and, when all else fails, a very informative UI once you get used to it. Communities like that rarely form around games that aren't worth the time. Also, while the systems can be a bit complicated it's for a reason. They're fairly unique and actually kind of elegant in a way, once you're used to them you wouldn't want to change them because they represent the sheer amount of customization possible in the game.  Speaking of systems and community and all that jazz, the dev seems really nice and updates are coming very regularly at time of writing. the last two months have seen two huge updates that not only tweaked and fixed things but also introduced entirely new components and systems into the game that have had big effects on how we design things. I have zero complaints about how this early access campaign is being run, and I've been burned a couple times now so I'm a bit more critical than most.  Now on to the fun bit... you can build pretty much whatever you could possibly imagine (or at least an angular interpretation of it). No, I'm serious, this isn't the typical minecraftian ""build anything"" shtick, you really can. If you feel like it you can build a working star destroyer in the same game that you build a scale model of the bismark, along with the queen anne, the enterprise (both nautical and otherwise), the avro arrow or some crazy original design that probably shouldn't work but does, all of which can have attached AI's that allow them to pilot themselves. More importantly though, there's a reason to build all that. This game actually has a campaign, with enemies to test your designs against and a goal to direct yourself towards. There's also workshop support for player made campaigns full of player made factions with player made designs that open up virtually infinite possibilities. Personally I think that's what most of these ""build 'em ups"" are lacking, a point. You have experiences to learn from to make a more efficient design, something to do when you're sick of sticking blocks to other blocks as well as some genuinely good strategy gameplay that let's you take direct control of any unit you bolt a controller to. It's the kind of game that people who enjoy this kind of thing could play for years without getting bored. And I haven't even touched the multiplayer, that's not (entirely) from lack of desire but from just the sheer wealth of things I can do on my own before having to resort to including other people to supplement the fun.The Tl;Dr  If you're too lazy to read a review to get an informed opinion then you probably should be looking at games that don't focus on menial tasks like building stuff.Seriously though, this is a fantastic game once you become acquainted with it, containing virtually infinite content for those inclined. There's something for people who like to build unique designs and people who like to watch other peoples unique designs explode into confetti. It provides a structured challenge to lend a point to the creative aspect of the game with systems that promote experimentation. It's one of the more well managed forays into early access with consistent content updates that have significant impacts as well as being a game that's good enough to play already. Basically, buy it is what I'm getting at.			"

								From the depths is a fantastic idea with lot of potential that you can already experience in the Early Access.In this game you build a ship or aircraft (or a combination of both) using a combination of blocks (think minecraft) that you then use in a Campaign map to destroy other crafts, or in single event battles against others.The crucial element of this game is that each element of the build (engine, guns, missiles, hull) is itself built by blocks, that, depending on what you want to optimise, requires non-trivial choices of configurations. This reasoning applies to everything:* hulls: material and structure affects: attrition in water/air, area of exposure, weight vs armour.* guns: length of gun barrel, shell exit velocity, shell composition, reload time, barrel cool-out time, affects effectiveness of the shell on target, size, area of exposure to enemy fire.* missiles, mines and grenades, torpedo (pins, Infra-red detection, warhead size, etc.)* engine (cylinders, turbo-chargers, exhausts, etc.).For example, an engine can be built to be very heavy and efficient (in fuel consumption), but can also be lighter and less efficient, or optimised for low-RPM, or for high-RPM, and this depends solely on the blocks you choose, and how they are positioned in relation to each other.Finally, the combination of each of these pieces then makes the craft itself suitable for some things (e.g. a bomber, a battleship), but very unsuitable for others (a fighter, a submarine), and is therefore the combination of different designs that leads to total victory.Ah, and, of course, you then actually drive/fly the thing, or put an AI doing it for yourself. And there are a lot of other things (resources management and logistics, strategy and tactics in campaign), that I will not even touch here to simplify... It has the best ingame tutorial I ever seem (and I play computer games for more than 20 years), very good game mechanics, and lot of non-trivial decisions for the player.I strongly recommend this game.One of the major drawbacks of the current state of the game is FPS. Despite all the efforts from the developers, it is still in pretty bad shape, and I do hope that the code base on which this game is programmed allows to fix this outstanding issue.			"

								I like to build stuff. I like to blow stuff up.This game lets me do this in a spectacular way.This game lets you design your own vehicles of destruction, and the choice is yours if you want to unleash them on your friends in multiplayer, or on the AI factions in the campaign.When you first start this game up and try to build something awesome, you will most likely fail. DON'T GIVE UP! Keep trying to improve on your designs, and eventually you will have built some incredible crafts that you can be proud of. It takes some time to learn the mechanics, but when you do learn them you will come to love this game. The recently added tutorials will help you to get started, and I insist that you give them a go early on to get a good grip on what to do, and what not to do.The developer is constantly working on cool updates and is very active on the game's main forum. Just yesterday better support for land vehicles and modding was added. Tank battles, here I come!			"

								It just looks like your run-of-the-mill voxel buidling game, but it breaks away those preconceptions within minutes. The sheer scope of the game is mind-boggling! Create ships, planes with and without wings, space stations and ships, submarines, buildings, and newly added land vehicles, only limited by the strength of your PC!  Jump into the designer mode to realize your internal warlord, then spawn in any enemy to learn how its made! Learn, build, and destroy to your hearts content until your forces are strong enough to contend with the denizens of Neter, then subjegate them all in open campaign.  The community is very supportive, and the Devs are open, funny, and active on the forums.  there are tournaments, contests, RP players, replica builders, and scientists to welcome you.

I have not seen a game like this one anywere else on steam.

								A sandbox game with insane amount of depth involved in designing vehicles. When building a vehicle you'll have to think about stuff like what kind of armor to build; spaced, just thick and heavy, or just light, or where on vehicle critical parts such as ammo reserves or engines should be placed to keep them intact to give enough time for your selection of highly customiseable weapon system to destroy the enemy.The game is quite well balanced, so the design of the vehicle really matters. Even simple and small vehicles can be more effective than big and weakly designed. In conclusion, there are just so many things to tweak when building a vehicle, that the game just leaves me thinking after testing a vehicle: just gotta improve that thing to make it even better. And in the end i just realize: the previous vehicle was actually better... That being repeated multiple times gives the game a great replay value.An EA title that is definetly worth the money (look at the playtime on reviews for extra proof). The game also gets updated at reasonable frequency, and seems completely bug free, but some features still need polishing.			"

								Good game with great potential. This game is diffrent form just about any other game i have seen. It has alot to offer, with a near infinate replayability and multi-player (i have not yet tried the multi-player so no comment on how well it works). Realy the only big problem with the game is the fact that when you start the game the learning curve is like rinning head first into a brick wall. The developers are obviously tring to fix this with tutorials built into the game. The tutorials that are built in make it more like running head first into a brick wall with a pillow on your head or a helmet depending on how much time you are willing to spend watching tutorials. the way i attempted to learn the game was by watching a lets play of it and then tring to do the things the guy in the lets play was doing and looking at the ingame tutorials whenever i got stuck. I don't recomend doing that, I ended up losing the game and restarting the campagn 4 times because of it. The only other thing that i think sould be changed is the difficalty right at the beginning of the game the 1st or 2nd enemy you fight is a army of flyers and warships. I think they sould add in A LOT more before that kind of thing shows up it makes the beginning of the game feel rushed and panicked (especially for a new player), and makes the learning curve feel even steeper because it puts you on a time limit to elimination.

								This game is just a really complex ship building simulator. It has some battle aspect to it, it has some creative aspect, and best of all it has physical and a realistic aspect to it. This game is really complex, so if you are planning on buying this watch some videos on how to build and see if you like it. This game still has a lot to be worked on. The devs in this game are generally really good and respond to your complaints which is awsome. \Pros: The game is fun and overall adictive to play.- The game is very smooth on low end laptops. I tested this with my brothers computer. He is 8 years old. The specs are : I3 3227u- Cpu @ 1.90 ghz with intel integrated graphics 4000. It has 6 gbs of ram. His laptop runs this game at a solid 45 frames with no lag spikes. Although if you have really big intense battles your fps can drop down to 5 - 6 fps but its still playable and watchable. I tested this with high settings btw.- This game is well develeped and the building system is pretty good but not perfect.- I like the fact you can control your ships with AI but sometimes Ai is kinda bad.- The main menu is well made and has a nice background and what I like about it is that it shows a tiny battle with some creative ships. - The way you build custom engines and weapons is genuis. This idea is very revoultuionaryCons- I couldn't think of one lolGenerally good game and I think you should buy it "

								Literally played for 12 hours, doing nothing but desperately trying to build a ship that doesnt instantly get owned by the weakest enemies in the Deepwater Guard, but still relatively cheap so it is possible to spawn it in once i start the campaign.Finally, success. Bigger feeling of satisfaction than anything i built in Space Engineers (Great game too but due to it not having a purpose to what you build, no enemies that try to invade your territory, no enemy strongholds to assault, no resource zones to fight over).If you thought this game looked interesting in lets plays, it is far more enthralling when you actually design something yourself. It is always like this with creative games. If it looks interesting in a lets play, it is ten times more interesting once you risk your own dear creations against the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI's on the high seas.There is a surprising ammount of ingame help though. Step by step guides on how to assemble engines, custom cannons and such. A well defined ""wikipedia"" ingame with proper notes on most game concepts and part functions.In the part list when you build, each part is laid out logically in the grid, with connectable pieces branching off each other so you can at a glance see that ""ah, crankshafts are placed after the engine block"" etc. Truly an incredible game, runs far better than i thought. And i'm on a quadcore laptop, maxed it out, even got Reshade postprocessing added for extra eyecandy. No framerate drops apart from in huge battles, but the game slows down the simulation rate instead much like Kerbal Space Program.I dont really have room to mention everything about the game, the best bet is just to watch lets plays, and see if you are interested. I was honestly surprised at how ""NOT completely buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥or unoptimized as hell"" it was, since these types of games tend to be that way. It has been worked on for quite some time, now is a perfect time to jump in. It is playable. It runs well. It is just great.			"

								Good daySo after 200 hours playing the game i thought that i will share my opinion :)200 hours of game time...........maybe 50 hours spent in campaign, and believe it or not i still can not make any thing that flies..... i tried lol, and watched 100000 videos. So i stick to ships and subs, which works great. After so may hours i also still dont know exactly what everything does in the game, and after the recent patch i basically had to re learn most of the stuff from scratch again.Below i shall provide my Pro's and ConsPro's*there is no end to this game, you can play 10000 hours and keep going*The content will blow your mind, and it just keeps comming*The things you can build is endless*Physics is awesome*GFX and sound is great*there is multiplayer, sand box, custom campaign, campaign and freaken 1000000 other modes*Cheap for the game you are gettingCons*Very Very difficult to learn, but you can still play even if you know only 20% lol*The FPS drops when you are in big Battles, but you can do 100000 different things to prevent that*Air vehicles needs work so that any one can build them*The tutorials is ok, but needs work( There are great Youtube vids out there though)I cant really think of anything bad to say about the game, it is definately not perfect, but will never regret the day i bought it. The Devs are also awesome and the updates comes in like no other game i have seen.Thank you :).			"

								ive been playing for 2 weeks now, and loving it. lets get started on a good review shall we?so for starters, there are alot of different game modes. since im mostly a solo player i'll be mostly talking about singleplayer.(there is also miultiplayer) for more information, look further into the reviews.  so when you first start the game, watch the bad@#$ battle that literally plays live behind the main menu (click the box at the top right for full screen battle) when you click singleplayer it will urge you to watch, read, or do-it-yourself tuturiols for a good reason. the game is extremely hard to understand, theres so many thingimigigs, gadgets to put together it might even give you a headache. (i recommend doing the tutoriols before playing) when you do the tutoriols (or skip them) you have the choice of different campagns for different factions including one ""RPG"" campaign. it will give you the story of how your character came to be.  you start on what seems like a wooden oil rig fit with all of the necessities and very light defense which cant hold out against the first attack, so upgrade ittheres 8 total factions. they are interactable, you can bribe them, ally with them, and go to war with them (all as they go to war with eachother) the vehcicle designer is basically a creative mode but for testing vehicles of your desing before saving and constructing them in your campaign.overral its a great game with a huge and sharp learning curve			"

								This game is addictive for people that like to work with interacting systems. This engine design could put out more power, could be more fuel efficient, if I redesign this gun I can save space while taking a marginal hit to efficiency, if I change the hull I can take more hits while preserving bouyancy, etc.Do beware that it'll take a few hours spent on each unique element to fully understand what makes it work and what doesn't.

								From the depths is an AMAZING game considering its alpha state. It has a construction engine similar to Space engineers, IE placing blocks of various materials to form a structure, objects such as generators and engines to give power to items such as propellers, jets, etc. (Though it has more useful features like mirror, fill, position and free flying around the vehicle)Everything is very logical and fairly intrinsic, but moreso is that each section of your crafting menu with a complex object (IE an engine, gun, AI system) has a nice little tutorial that you can select and walk through section by section.This game as an immensely complex crafting system, and the sheer number of options are daunting, but take your time just fussing around with things and checking the tutorial when you get confused, and it's pretty easy to learn and very fun to see what you can come up with. But even MORE fun to pit your creations against others.Ultimately this game is extremely fun for a tinkerer such as myself, considering that I not only get to build all kinds of curious war machines, but you actually get to test them against enemies as well. There are even unlockable items via story (Challenge) missions, and a RTS-esque campaign of using your custom built army to dominate a map filled with several factions of varying allegiance and attitude towards the player. On top of that your charater gains levels and has equipment and skills that can be unlocked, though currently some are not implemented entirely.As it stands, this game is simply amazing with its current features, and quite fun. But the even moreso is the potential of the game.Look up ""Budkai (1,2,3,etc)K tournament"" on youtube for an awesome, action filled example of what the game has to offer. You should find several tournaments where player machines (Controlled by AI) fight to the death!			"

That's all I can say...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...also if you have troubles I would recomend you check out people like Lathland on youtube since one of the best ways of learning it is by watching.10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again... 10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...10/10 SHIP MURDERING SIM!! would murder again...

								Very steep learning curve, but once you've figured it out, you're hooked.Took me about 8 hours of looking stuff up and watching youtube videos of how to build things or how stuff worked, but now i'm to the point that I can build something that can take down practically everything else (with minor problems on the bigger guys).So far, best gun i''ve made was a 500mm cannon with a 60m barrel, 8m long shells and took close to a full minute to reload, but the power of this gun... all my other guns peppered the on coming targets and the missiles took a good chunk out, but this gun one shots everything with their crumpling mass falling to either side of the massive hole going through their middle.

								Minus the 160-degree learning curve, it's pretty good. You'll need to search up about 9 hours worth of tutorials to get a basic engine to work, however, as the new in-game tutorials just show you how to make the engines/sails/etc. instead of showing you how to connect them to anything. 8/10, original tutorials were much better, there was no need to remove them.

Quite a bit of a learning curve, but plenty of materials, videos and ingame hints to learn from, very helpful community (on the official forums anyway) and a very active developer.Graphics might not be the best, but it more than makes up for that with the gameplay, and the amount of silly things you can build, kill or be killed with.

								Here's a short review by some guy which is myself. There's a pretty steep learning curve, but it's worth it when you make awesome battleships with massive guns (that you also  get to make yourself) and automated fleets of little ships to protect your resource gathering operation, gathering resources to build even more ships and forever expanding your empire and taking over territories :D. Also you can make submarines and aircraft too, and if you've got a knack for it, they're probably going to look really cool :).Im summary, it's a good game and you should buy it.			"

								do you like to build things? Do you like explosions? Well this game lets you build almost anything which will eventually explode!This game (although still in alpha) is great if you like building and real time stratagy. it is an open world sandbox game with physics that lets you build ships, planes, helecopters, floating forts, and even an orbital death star if you want. If that seems a little too complicated than the steam workshop has lots of user created erm... vehicles to use in campaign mode or to use and abuse in the vehicle designer   The main campaign is about world domination, you get a small fort and a little boat in the corner of the world where you have to attack and defend againsed different factions each with their own different erm...vehicles using your own creations or things from the steam workshop fighting over precious resource zonesStory mode is a little sparse on content (The foundations are there for more ) you'll get given a vehicle/structure or specific number of resources to build with in order to complete a specific task. e.g. Build a fort and survive 3 waves of enemy.  This is a great game, the learning curve is a little steep for the new player and the ingame tutorials are a bit vague but just look at it as a challenge. The graphics are nice, the gameplay is nice and the stuff you can build is insane. There is plenty of community support on steam and on the From The Depths forums. The devs are very often on the forums too gathering loads of user feedback and creating patches/updates fairly regular (which is good for the game but bad for old aircraft...)			"

								Think of games like: Minecraft, Space engineers and StarMade add them up and you get From the Depths.I will try and keep this review short.I can recommend this game for people who likes the games I said about at the start. You create Boats, Submairnes, Planes, Heilcopters, Castles and Forts, Space Ships and anything that you can think of. The way it looks is like BorderLands/MinecraftThe game has a few modes: Single Player story mode, Muiltplayer, and vehicle desginer.Vehicle desginer is my fav part of the game, you load up in the open world and make your transport or Fort. You need to think about a lot of things while making your 'thing' Water placement, air drag and water drag. Making it off balance, making the angle of the armour right to make the shells bounce off. All in all the physics are 10/10When you are happy with the thing you made now time to test it out in combat. Battles can last from only a few seconds ending with a well placed shot into there ammo or fuel bay ripping the ship in half and watching it sink into the sea. Or they can go on into the hours with two or more well designed ships going at it. Moments like that are enjoyable.In the vehicle Designer you can spawn in a number of diffrent enemeys with many factions, having a huge battle with boats, planes and heilcopters.Im happy with the money I spent on the game, and am very much looking forward to what the game turns into in the future. 8.5/10			"

								I would love it if you read this completely.  I love this game, but there are the most basic settings errors.  First of all there needs to be a toggle for the rounds to be rendered or even placed as entities (or whatever) because i just recently had mu computer break and i now work on my backup, that just so happens to be a hp windows Vista laptop with 4 gigs of ram.  Secondly, can you guys add an auto flatten ability or whatever because when i make a fortress without something holding it in place till whatever makes it fly is built, it will flop around in the water and when the item is built, the fortress comes out tilted when i pull it out of the water and i don't know how to fix it if i can.  Also can there be a setting toggle for waves, reflections, the jumping of the cylenders for engines, and the smoke (and clouds), the reason why i ask this is because in most games these contribute to massinv fps loss, the max i can ever get my laptop to run is around 30 fps and i would like to get more than 10 fps max in From The Depths.  I watch famous youtubers (i think there famous) complain all the time about the amunitions in the clips with the advanced cannons being a major fps killer, like bringing a computer that usually plays From The Depths at 60 fps, in an older version, down to around 20-10 fps or even lower, its like making the computer scream for mercy in my mind.  all i can really think of anf if these things were added or fixed than this game would be really enjoyable on a very sucky computer.

								174 hours later, I regret nothing.Voxel survival games generally disagree with me on one major point: Mining.  I hate mining.  I hated in in EVE Online, in FFXIV, in Runescape, even in Minecraft, which can at least claim to offer some solace from the monotony by throwing in procedurally generated caverns and dungeons and such.  Starmade was promising for me, but unfortunately, the first thing you build in a Starmade campaign is - you guessed it - a miner.  Space Engineers made it prettier, but more complicated and ultimately just as boring.  Even Elite: Dangerous has mining, not that it forces you to participate in it, but still.Apparently somebody who developed FtD felt the same way and decided that resources should be acquired not by shooting at rocks but by capturing and defending points.  The mining gets done automatically, so you can be elsewhere doing other things while still getting all the materials you need for your next vehicle.  This is brilliant.  Obviously it's less of a skill-based mechanic (I guess you can be good at mining?) and more of a time-based one, but this makes sense for a real-time strategy game, which From the Depths most definitely is.On a macro level, the combat in From the Depths is similar to hybrid turn-based/real-time strategy games like Ogre Battle.  Once built, your vehicles can be moved off the board and replaced by simple sprites.  The point of this is to accelerate the game clock and allow you to move your vehicles across the map in seconds rather than days.  Of course, your enemies can do this too, so you need to consider visual range or else you might accidentally bump right into an enemy fleet that you'd rather avoid at the moment.  FtD has the potential for grand strategy campaigns, though currently the installed campaign is big but simple.The combat really shines on a micro level, though.  Vehicles conform to realistic physics.  Ships can float by the buoyancy of their materials (like wood) or by airtight pockets of ballast.  Too much weight on the top of a ship will cause it to capsize, or tilt one way or another.  Put your propulsion blocks off-center and you'll spin rather than turn, or dive rather than push forward.  When you've got everything perfect, that's great - but what happens if somebody blows a hole in your starboard ballast?  Combat is ultimately about exploiting the physical weaknesses in your opponent's vehicle while making yours as failproof as possible.  And there's certainly a lot of ways to make failure happen.  Customizable cannons with armor-piercing shells and penetration-fused explosives?  Check.  Depth charges and torpedoes?  Check.  AI-controlled drone vehicles launched from a mothership?  Check.  Laser-guided missiles, laser-assisted flak cannons and just your typical face-melting lasers?  Czech.  I think the best part of this game is arguably the hundreds of hours you could spend just learning to craft and perfect the weapon you need to counter a specific threat, or a variety of threats, and then dropping it on the deck of your ship before running into an enemy cruiser.If there's just one problem with this game, I'd say that the sound effects can get awfully monotonous.  I don't need to hear the water plunging sound every time I put my camera beneath the waves.  Before Advanced Custom Cannons came around, every cannon shot, big or small, played exactly the same sound effect.  Now the pitch varies based on the size of the cannon, but it's just the same .wav played faster or slower.  I'd like sound effects for engines, cannons, missiles, et cetera, to be moddable in-game so that I can put a real 20mm cannon sound behind my gatling guns.  That would be pretty neat.The other problem is that the multiplayer, like other voxel games, is hosted by players.  There's no matching queue for formal PvP.  There's ""tournaments"" but what this entails is putting a bunch of designs on a map and turning on their AI.  It's hard to call this PvP when it's effectively the same thing as hitting Autocalc in a Total War game.  The developers have been busy adding excellent and much-needed content, so it's not like I expect that they'll crank out a MOBA-style multiplayer mode in the next month or two, but it feels like the game is missing PVP (aside from the kind that will get you kicked out of a player-hosted server).  But I guess that's something that I can look forward to.If you like mining, you might not like this game.If you like Starmade, Robocraft, Space Engineers, World of Warships, or just blowing things up with a cannon, you'll like this game.

								This game is hands down one of THE MOST amazing voxel based sandbox games I have EVER seen. This game smashed minecraft out of the water like some tiny liferaft to a volley of 200 missles for me. I have never felt like I was able to express myself adequately in terms of war machines, and this game is pretty much designed to do just that. whether you want massive submarines, tiny pocket battleships, laser satalites, missle volley ships with over 200missles, this game has it all, you can make anything you want.This game does suffer from potato frying optimization HOWEVER its getting better, the developer seems to always be hard at work adding something and fixing problems with the game. They recently came out with the APS or Advanced Projectile System and I feel like I've fallen in love all over again.			"

								Have you ever dreamed of a game that is a mix of minecraft, total war, FPS action, with some pirateering thrown in for good measure? If so, this game is for you. In From the Depths, build a ship (or fleet of ships) in order to wipe out the opposing factions. You do this by capturing resource zones where you can drill for resources to build bigger better ships. This simple goal leads to a very open experiance. The map/planet of Nieter alone has about seven or so factions to interact with through a simple to understand diplomacy panel, a massive amount of space to conquer, with some islands sprinkled in to use however you like. That's not even mentioning the built in planet builder, where you get to create a whole new experiance, or the planets that the developer is probably planning to patch in. The planet itself is not whats interesting however. Its the ship building. You have a very wide range of blocks, each with different functions to build your fleet with. You can build everything from massive steel battleships, to wooden sail based gallions, to riverboat paddlesteamers. If you find that you dont like building ships, you can board and take over the enemy ships. You could say ""Screw sailing"" and build an airship if you so choose. You can costomize every aspect of your ship, even the guns/lazers/kim jong un approved missiles it carries. I definitely think that this game is worth the money. FAIR WARNING: This game is fairly difficult to learn. Be prepared to do some resarch/ watch some youtube videos.			"

								Well, Did I like this game.. I have played almost 1000 hours of it... I Praise it constantly... I try to get everyone to play it... Yea Im obsessed.This is a game where you can place your fleet, not only can you place your fleet you can design the ships, not only can you design the guns you can design the BULLETS THEY FIRE!!!! It has a small story but it is easly overlooked(It never thrusts it apon you) With MANY MANY MANY items and okay graphics, the main world(Neter) Is so large It is verry hard to explore the whole world(Only been to the edge once), and when your done, there are more worlds, and when you explore those(Something I havent done(Yet)), download some easly from the workshop, and when those are done make your own in an easy to use world designer. If you like stratagy, this game is for you. If you like sandbox, this game is for you. If you want to have huge battles on a collosal scale, do so. Do whatever you want. and after all I have done, I still havent beaten even one of the numerous campaignes, or most of the many missions, AND I am still bad at designing ships in one of the many sandbox modes. The multiplayer is amasing with many modes you can play with your friends worldwide. What can you make? Airships, Subs, Boats, Fighters,Bombers, Scouts, Planes,The occasional Walker, Spaceships, Tanks, Fortresses,Blimps ,Ramming Ships, Nukelear Kamacazi,Structures, Helicopters, Hover ships, Sailing ships, steam engings, fuel engens, lazers, cannons, Shields, Missiles, ect. You can play with limited resorce or with limitied volume, or not. You can make it easy, or not. You can win diplomaticly, or just go in cannons blazing, you can blow ships up or break in and take them, controll your ships yourself or give the AI Some power, you can play with detectors like radar scanners or heat sensors ect all fully implemented with realistic physics, some blocks are more expensive but block EMP or block HEAT Shells, Or give of more radar signature, angle also effects radar and the chance of a shell bounce, the game has a slight learning curve issue but that is an upside for me because it is a chance to experement in a game that is updated constantly adding new features with a fully fledged steam workshop. The game has amasing controlls that are game specific but that can be overridden if you so choose. I could complement this game for hours. I personaly like finding ship weaknesses and building ships designed to use the weaknnesses of the other ships. If you like dodging flac in a nimble fighter or just tanking it out in a large hovership, this game fills all of the gaps and is the most sandbox game I have ever seen. with its senario designers the world is at your fingertips and I recomend this to everyone. Expecialy if you like sandbox, or stratagy, or exploration. And all the stuff I said, is just the tip of the iceberg of things you can do in the best game EVER. I could continue complementing for hours(I think Im repeating myself) just watch some videos on it, try it out, and get the game and you will understand what I mean			"

								""From the Depths"" is a war sandbox, voxel-based builder.  It has a couple different campaigns that come with the game, but you'll mostly spend your time on Neter.  Here, you must build ships, planes, helicopters, tanks, fortresses, zeppelins, spaceships, and whatever you might need in order to conquer the eight factions that lie between you and all of Neter.Except it's not that simple.  Because the vessels you'll face aren't just some rummaged-together rafts with peashooters (althought some of the Deepwater Guard might actually apply to that statement).  They're great big battleships with thundering cannons.  They're planes that zip across the sky at super-sonic speeds.  They're airships that block out the sun.  They're satelites that can call down a hail of missiles from orbit.  They're thrustercrafts with more lasers than the local nightclub.  The learning curve is staggering, and the beginner will come into a new game with whatever they've managed to piece together to face the pirates, merchants, zealots, scientists, AIs, admirals, and aliens that are aimed against them.  And they'll probably lose.  But that's the fun part.  You lose, and you learn.  You build a better ship.  You win.  And then you lose to something even more powerful.  And then you build an even better ship.  And the cycle continues.  And you let it continue because it's oddly fun to tune your crafts, to make them balance in the water, or soar in the sky.  To make them bombard an enemy from afar from behind numerous shields and meters of armor plating, or ram them at high speeds with all the drills you can carry.It helps to have some free time, as you'll likely spend hours just working on a single craft, testing it in the vehicle designer before you actually bring it out in the campaign.  Heck, you might not even get into the campaign, and instead just keep building and building until you have crafted your own faction to rival all that might appose you.And you'll never stop.  The devs are active, updating the game on a regular basis, and there's a beta branch with even more frequent, if slightly more unstable, updates.  And the community is active, with a Workshop where people post modifications to the game, new vessels that they've built, or even new campaigns they've composed.  All new challenges to overcome.That's what From the Depths is about.  Building, learning, improving.  And it's why it might just be my favorite game.			"

								with the new advanced cannons you can build super-strong cannons for their size and resources! would like to have custom resource gatheres so you can make them more powerfull (more stacks per item so 1 block will make you mine 2 resources so every block would add 1 resource mined per mine-tick) of more effiecent ( more resources per 1 item in the zone) faster speed (it mines faster) for the oil and resource plant! i would like to make GIANT oil rigs. but make them REALLY EXPENSIVE so you cant just spam them. EDIT = the trailer is kind of outdated becuase of the new advanced cannon system hope you make a new one.			"

								Good fun.  High learning curve and there are still elements im still learning, but brilliant fun..Starting on a small, raft is a little daunting, but you soon build your first boat.  then you look at how to build your first engine...once you learn how to setup AI to control your boat, the fun starts with all the weapons....Best way to learn is youtube vids.  Definately lots of fun....			"

								If you remove the old custom cannons, I want a full refund straight away. Also can't play the game for more than 30 minutes without it crashing now. Otherwise yeah, pretty fun game.			"

								Think Legos, yet you get to watch and pilot your ships or planes or subs or space craft and duke it out with the AI campaign.  This game has a working campaign, so there is a reason to build other than ""creative"" mode.			"

								So I'm going to be honest about this review. Sure I recommend this game - but only to those who are willing to put time into researching the basics of the game or are willing to try, fail, try fail, try, fail and eventually succeed. I can't really say mutch about the learning curve of the game, as I had watched 5+ hours of footage bofore even looking at the game's store page. From what I've read of the negative reviews of this game the overwhelming majority of people have less than 10 hours in-game and they complain about the lack of a tutorial (there is one, if you look). And the clunky UI and controls. Sure, if you don't like the UI, that's your choice - but those who are used to the UI will most likely agree with me when I say it's quite informative. As for the controls - yes they can be a little offputting at times, and currently not rebindable (I'm sure this will be added at a later date) but like the rest of the game - you get used to them. Oh, there is a mouse building mode (much like minecraft or space engineers) and that may fix your problems.Now, onto why I think this game is great:+The game has surprising amounts of depth (pun intended)+Encourages creativity in designs+Very expansive campaign mode+Useful building tools+Whilst only haveing a few types of basic block, there is a very wide variety of types of said base materials+Nothing is indestructableNow, some of the negatives:-People may not like the learning curve-The game recently became much more complex with the advanced cannons-Non-rebindable controls (will remove when added)			"

								A really great premise--I love engineering games. An interesting attempt at a combination of RTS, FPS, and engineering. I've put loads of hours into it, but at this point, it's just a glitch fest. Barely anything works the way you expect it to, and you find yourself trying to figure out all of the workarounds or just trying to accept that nothing is working quite right.Pros: vision, conceptCons: Constantly crashes, does not effectively utilize computer resources, extremely glitchy.

								It wasn't what I expected it to be after watching a couple of you tubers play. In the future I might consider buying it again and spend hours trying to figure out how to play. The game is EARLY ACCESS so I believe some work is still being improved.			"
