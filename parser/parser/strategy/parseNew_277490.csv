												If you love old school type action shooters such as Battleships or 1942 then you're going to love Battle Group 2 as it combines the best of those, it's so easy to just pick up and play with no complicated controls or instructions and with minimal setup as well so you'll be up and playing in a couple of minutes. In fact it's such a breeze that any fool can play it.This is strictly a single player game with 30 stages in the campaign and starts off very easy and gets progressively more difficult with each stage that you complete, there are no difficulty options so everyone plays the same game. Each stage is very short and your job is to control a single ship at the start and two ships after your have upgraded to fend off various waves of planes and helicopters which can be shot down with your ships guns or missiles which can also be upgraded at the end of every stage when your scores and rewards are displayed. You control a primary ship which is your main weapon and a support ship which offers backup and there are a total of 8 ships that you can collect and use throughout the game.Ok graphics and sound i have to say is really quite impressive, really nice detail in the sea which flows quite nicely and all the ships behave as they should but the sound is far more impressive, guns have a real nice meaty sound as they should and the planes also sound very good and they do sound like jets too. The voice overs for the story content is nicely done and there are some good background voices too for the ships, the controls are really so easy and all you have to worry about is moving the mouse to aim at the targets and then the mouse button to fire your weapons.This is a very casual game so you can play it as much or as little as you like, it's just a great load of fun but it's very addictive i can tell you !! Depending on how well you do in any given stage you are rewarded with a number of stars so reach 90% of your goal on that stage and you'll be rewarded with 3 stars and get over 100% and you'll receive 4 stars but they are golden so can you collect all the stars? Some stages although not all that difficult will leave you pulling your hair out especially if you want all those golden stars, sometimes i found myself on 99% and thought there's no way i can do that but your will keep trying until you get there.In summary just ask yourself do you like planes and ships and want a good fun time without reading loads of instructions or have a long winded tutorial or without needing to know what you have to do to get any where? If that all sounds good to you then you could do a lot worse than boot this baby up, oh and by the way there is more content to come and the Developers are rather active in the community and are a friendly bunch of souls so why not give it a go? I personally rate it a rather good 82/100 but that may improve after more content arrives but have fun playing the game.			"

A Simple Game but Fun! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I'll begin by saying this is an iOS port, so it was thought for touchscreens. By the way, it works great also with the mouse! :-)I am very impressed by how much fun this game is. You play as the artillery man of a battle ship (in later part of the game, of a fleet!) and you have to shoot down enemy ships, helicopters and aircrafts... taking also care of all they can throw at you! While you advance the game you will be able to upgrade you ships and to gain access to different weapons: beaconing, EMPs, time distortion bombs...Graphic is nice, sound is pleasant, story is unobtrusive (i skipped all the cutscenes... all you need to know is that you have to destroy the usual villain and his personal army!) and there are also last level's bosses to fight against!Yes, it is not a blockbuster nor an AAA game (it should be a port of a mobile game!), and this should be clear by by now, thanks also to videos and screenshots from the game page, but it's fun and addictive and I evaluate this as the most important aspect of a game!It reminds me of some neo-geo coin-ops of the '80, and this is definitely a plus!Unfortunately is does not last long: just 2-3 hours. It also does not have a great repeatability because there aren't different difficult levels or different game modes. :(Advice: use the keyboard for launching the special attacks!Best played with Mouse (and Keyboard) (or iOS)Recommended Buy Price < 5$Score 8/10 "

												Game plays similar to the old arcade classic missle command , except you are on water firing from ships. There is a decent story but what stands out is the ability to purchase better ships , upgrades and you can also replay any mission to gain more resources and better stars. Taking down enemies gets a bit hard with the regular missiles so will be depending support attacks and powers.Overall a decently priced game that works fine and is a good time killer.7/10			"

												This is a top-down game with the same elements as the old missile command. The difference is that you are in the water, controlling a big ship. It's very simple, but also vey fun.The story isn't anything special here. You are the good guy and you are going after some bad guy, that's really about it. As you move forward in the game you face off more difficult enemy helicopters and ships. It's all about timing your missiles correctly. Doing so will get you oil, which you can use for upgrades on your ship, or to buy a completely new one.The story can be completed in a few hours, but thanks to all the different ships and upgrades I would say there is replay value of some sort. You can play this game only by using your mouse, so it's quite a relaxing game.There's a lot of fun to be had here and many achievements to unlock. I would recommend this as a time killer for sure.

Battle Group 2 is a short and sweet Missile Command type of game. Guide your ships through hostile waters while eliminating threats and incoming projectiles with the weapons at your disposal. It's very simple in concept, but a lot of fun for the price.Yes, this game is a mobile port, but as far as mobile ports go, Battle Group 2 is an excellent one. It plays very well as a quick casual game to kill a couple of hours, though that's about it as the game is lacking in singleplayer content. The purchasing and upgrading of new warships is a nice feature, but the campaign is unfortunately very short-lived. If it were a bit lengthier, I would have no faults to give this otherwise fun game.Definitely recommended. Hopefully an update or a sequel comes along soon.			"

												I didn't like missile command way back when.  Guess I still don't like it now.  I got this in a humble bundle and decided to give it a shot in my quest to clean out my unplayed games.  It's a pretty average game, it's solid in its own right.  No glitches or any glaring issues in the short time I played, which was probably around 45 minutes (I idled for its 7 card drops).  It's just... really boring.  You click places to kill slow moving planes and destroy missiles, having to slightly lead them due to how your projectiles work.  This seems like a flash game for tablets or something.Not an awful game, but not enough to hold my interest.			"

												An awesome remake of a classic, I dare even say, ""the classic"". The game I refer to is missle command. Yes, the 1980 classic gets some rennovations in Bane's side-scroller action shooter, though the ""side-scrolling"" is simulated but still a game that really tests your timing and prediction skills. Best played with a touchscreen but works equally as well with a gaming mouse or decent track pad or track ball (my fav). It's a fun little escape game, that will have you going ""just one more time."" At $8, its worth the price, on sale - it's a ""no pass up."" Graphics = Decent (runs smooth on my i5-HD3000 lappie)Sounds = Very good (immursive)Gameplay = Missle Command style ShooterReplayability = Yes (in challenges this game presents)Controls = Yes (just point and click, the rest is up to you) "

												Fun game, but it is rather short, you can play through the whole campaign in around 4 hours, which is a bit dissapointing for a game that costs $8. There is however room for replayability trying out the different ships once you earn enough oil to unlock them with all the upgrades.What is a bit annoying is that you can't get all the achievements even if you do a full playthrough earning four stars on all levels; you need at least another full playthrough to get the neccessary kills for the achievements.Overall I would give it 7/10.Update:It seems the game uses the registry for saves, instead of simple file saves, so there is no way to simply backup or move your save files, which is unfortunate.

												This is a very enjoyable game that plays well with a mouse and keyboard or a touch screen. It reminds me of missile command but has different ships and upgrades that you can buy with special weapons on them. The creator is still active in the forums and continues tweaking the game. There are 30 missions plus a final boss battle but you'll probably end up grinding a bit to get an early advantage which prolongs the game. The commanders of both forces play the G.I. Joe and Cobra Commander image which is a nice touch if you grew up watching those cartoons. I don't have anything negative to say about this game. I believe it was coded by one person which makes it all the more impressive.			"

												 Cute game :) More addictive than I would have thought at first. Though, it would have been 1000% Better as a WW2 game (I'm that kind of person). But, for modern warfare, it's a great little shoot 'em up. Highly recommended.  Although, if I do have a tiny piece of advice, before you spend oil points into updating the little corvettes, just save for the HP Destroyer and the Tico Cruiser. Trust me :) Really worth doing.

 TL;DR Simplistic arcade action game where you are in command 2 ships fighting against a new terror threatening the world. Easy to play and fun in short burst but won't hold your attention in a long while so play it sparingly. What is Battlegroup 2? A simple game where you are in command of 2 ships firing missiles towards everything that moves towards you as the auto steer ships move along without your control. Quite fun in little sessions but boring if played too much.+Fun arcadey experience+Reflex testing gameplay+Good difficulty scaling+/-Generic music+/-Average graphics-Requires a few grinding-enemies dont appear long enough sometimes so getting 100% is hardConclusionIts good enough to be enjoyed in small dosage but wont really hold your attention in the long run.

For the price it was defiantly worth purchasing and reliving the classic arcade style days once again. Best of luck to the devs, hope to see more games from them soon!			"

VERDICT: Battle Group 2 can best be described as a naval-themed strategy clicker, on-rails.  Take one or two ships, survive thirty-one naval patrols by destroying enemy planes, ships and missiles while keeping  your kill streak alive.  Gain rewards to upgrade and unlock better ships.  Its simple premise, fast-paced gameplay and short quick-fire sessions are sure to take you back to playing Missile Command back in the day.  The challenge is pretty easy, though gameplay is quite addictive.  Graphics are well-drawn and the music though simple, suits the pace of the game perfectly. Reservations include not so dynamic enemy spawns and pathing.  It gets grindy towards the end.  There is no endless mode and it could really do with more content with more ships, more weapons, more levels and even more action! Other than that despite its mobile/tablet origins, it was actually a fun port to play and is sure to be a draw for fans of casual games. ... More info below ...01. GENRE: Arcade/Clicker Action-Shooter.02. SETTING: Naval Warfare operations.04. GAME MODES: Singleplayer with one thirty-one level campaign.05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: So-called replayable missions but low randomness.  Missions can be replayed if failed.06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: Guide your ships to the end of the level and blast every enemy seen as your fleet moves horizontally across the screen without player input.  Point and click to shoot weapons or approaching missiles.  Your ships have numerous fixed weapons and anti-fire measures such as: missiles, cannons, helicopters, flares or anti-missile guns.   Maintaining high kill-streaks provide bonus oil barrels and raises your score.  A few Boss encounters are littered through the missions.  The action is in real-time.  Timing is everything.   Better ships can be unlocked with oil barrels earned by shooting enemy aircraft, missiles, installations and ships.  Three power-ups can be purchased to assist you: Hyper-time - slows down time, EMP Blast - clears enemy missiles and Instant Recharge - circumvents the reload time.  07. ENEMIES: There are a limited number of enemies, each with their own particular traits.  Kamikaze gunboats move slowly but zig-zag to avoid your fire.  Frogfoot sub-sonic planes fly slower and shoot projectiles while their Mig-type counterparts fly faster and fire homing rockets.  Forcing players to concentrate on where and when they fire.  Rockets provide a slow moving target but are fired in large numbers.  While helicopters hover and fire multiple times before fleeing off-screen.  Periodically you will see bonus aircraft.  These are harder to destroy but provide a good amount of bonus are help maintain kill-streaks.08. A.I: Basic but well implemented.  Mostly due to the fact that the A.I. doesnt have to react to anything.  The illusion of a clever enemy is conjoured through the use of varied flight-paths/pathing, increased numbers, speed of movement and spawn frequency.  However its all done very well and you never quite feel in control in the final missions.  Something I imagine is intentional so iOS users spend cash on power-ups.  PC users at least wont need to worry.  (Earn enough to buy power-ups by farming oil, by repeating missions)09. INTERFACE/CONTROLS: Very simple and robust.  Just mouse click on the target to shoot, use ships secondary equipment or activate a power-up.  Its not to hard to see why this was made for iOS.10. GRAPHICS: Pristine, clean-cut and great for this sort of game.  From the detailed artwork of each of the four primary and secondary support ships to the enemy air and seacraft, all of it is pretty to look at.  As are the explosions!  Changes to ships when damaged by enemy fire is neat.  As are the animations when you fail to protect them and they sink.11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Very good.  Music changes depending on the mood of the action from soft mellow _ to hard pulsating eletro rock tones when you are up against it!  Simulated battle chatter takes the overall audio experience from being good to just that bit more!12. VOICE ACTING: Very good again.  It has an excellently voiced female commander/co-pilot to help you through the first few missions which I thought was actually well-written and voiced.  Thought there isnt enough of it and during my playthrough she isnt used as much in the final third of the game.  Which is a shame.13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY:  Difficulty is very low to barely moderate.  The real challenge is slanted towards getting perfect or near perfect scores using high kill-streaks.  Given the speed of the moving craft, their numbers and frequency this becomes near impossible in some missions, especially towards the end.  For mere mortals like me the availability of the power-ups makes life much simple!  Overall the recipe is simple: Choose the right ships.  Have enough upgrades and power-ups and the game ceases to be much of a challenge and devolves into a click-fest!  14. PROBLEMS: None experienced.15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Possesses a good mix of achievements overall.  Complete campaign missions, use x type of power-ups, unlock y number of ships or earn n mission stars.  Achieve milestones such as: shoot z missiles, hit m targets etc.  Most are obtainable in a few hours.  Only a two; kill 10,000 targets, shoot 10,000 missile need a fair amount of grinding.16. DLC: None.17. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: Singleplayer only.18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: BG2 provides a good dose of fast and easily accessible shooting, blasting fun that may get somewhat old after about half-way.  It did for me.  19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:  The campaign can be completed in  five or so hours if you are efficient with your oil spending and get the ships you need rather than the highest ranked ones. You will have to be smart and grind out credits to purchase power-ups.  If you want 100% achievements then you will need to grind alot.  Doing so will extend the game life to at least ten hours.  More if you aren't fussed at getting perfect scores every time.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Its on sale quite frequently. Just about worth the full price, if your budget allows or you cant wait for a sale.

GeneralYou command battleships, small arensal to ac carriers. You can only have 1 battleship and a secondary ship by choice. When on the battlefield against advanced pirates, the gameplay can be slow or will knock your socks off with speed! Though, you have tactical advantages:  i.e. EMP, instant reload of cooldowns and the ability to instantly destroy all incoming missiles.Upgrading your ships can have a great affect on the battlefield. Decrease reload times, increase health, and more.My OpinionBattle Group 2 was such a surprise for me. Having doubts about getting Steam games lately can put some toll on you. Battleships to Aircraft Carriers, Battle Group 2 will make you prioritize and strategize against your pirate enemies. The campaign is very short, at least 1h or less of gameplay via campaign and Xh for the extra parts of the game like achievement gathering for example. Yes, Battle Group 2 does have easy achievements for avid achievement farmers. Strategy wise Battle Group 2 (when on the battlefield) will make you think, ""Should I use this before I do anything else? Should I destroy this missile before it hits me or continue to take down more important threats?""There's plenty of enemies to fight and win against. Don't think twice, just think before acting!OverallFirst time I saw this game I knew it was a winner. If I had to give this game con(s), it would be that the campaign could've had more levels and two ships were proven to be the only best ships to fight with. Overall, it is a fine game to master.Rating: 7/10			"

												This is a no brainer.  Exactly the kind of game we need sometimes just to relax for a couple of hours. And for that purpose Battle Group 2 is perfect.We command two ships. One shoots missiles while the other does the support i.e. provides us with abilities in order to eliminate the oncoming projectiles / missiles. There is a cool down for every missile we shoot and each ability we use - this requires some tactics on our end especially towards the end game.We have some upgrades for the ships and newer, bigger, better warships can be purchased. The currency is oil which we obtain after each and every completed mission. This is a typical game with grinding - we can repeat levels as many times as we want and we can have the best equipment before we begin the endgame.Do note that Battle Group 2 is the port of a mobile game. It really is a simple game with simple (yet sufficient) graphics and fast-paced, exciting gameplay. For a couple of euros this is an excellent purchase.			"

												well...what can i say?if you can get it really cheap then give it a try as long as you are aware that this is a port of a mobile game.a poorly optimized one that is. the game sometimes loves to slow down in the middle of the action even on a quad core with gtx 770. don't think you can enjoy this one on your granny's old typewriter.aim and fire your guns and use powerups if you feel the need. that's all there is. literally.oh and using oil you earned from clicking enemies to death to buy powerups and new ships or upgrades for your old ones.the game was finished in 2 hours. that included replaying a few levels to be able to afford the best stuff for the final missions.getting all the achievements completed took a total of 8 hours and this game really isn't interesting enough to make that not feel boring and tedious.but after all i even had to add 30 minutes of afk time to get the last trading card drop. this game has 15 (!) of them.if you want to spend some time on a casual clicker then it's fine.but if you expect something with any kind of depth then just don't.

												It has a nice classic feel to the gameplay and even the ""story"" though not so deep may gain some light affection from older audiences.  Through the game you play the role of the weapons controller for the main ship as it sets sail through various seas and channels as an onslaught of enemies try to take you down.  The enemy leader as many have pointed out will bring memories of Cobra Commander as your captain exchanges words with him.  All in all it kept me entertained and if by watching the video and looking at the screenshots it looks like something you could enjoy then go for it.Gameplay Control Points:1: You do not have to steer the ship, you only fire the main ship's weaponry. (Ammo recharges.)2: As you progress through the game  abilities become available for purchase & use: Reload 1/mission I think, EMP as many as you own, and time slow which is also as many as you own.  Time slow drastically decreases game speed while increasing missile ROF, speed, and recharging.3: You may unlock better ships with fuel from mission completions.4: You may unlock support ships with fuel as well, these have 1-2 activatable weapons with a shots & time limit to them before they go into cooldown.5: The controls are very simple and easy to use, I would recommend most people rebind them as they see fit.  The one trick to the game is strategic use of abilities and proper pacing and accuracy/leading of enemy targets when firing the weapons.			"

												An enjoyable mashup of missile command meets 1942 that will suck you in an cripple your wrists.Far from perfect the lack of hotkeys for specials means you will require twitchy and acurate wrist flicks and a certian degree of grinding, replaying levels is required to purchase upgrades if you want to get max stars for each level.About 1/3 the way through and its already starting to get a tad ott with what goes on at once.Runs fine FHD with max settings on an i7 2.4ghz, r9 265x laptop.Recived as part of a bundle well worth a buy if your an old school arcade game fan and is avail under £3.49, not sure I would pay more for it than that.

												Great little 2-D naval battle game.  Didn't expect much in the beginning but as upgrades became available, missions became more enjoyable.  This one allows you to succeed, so all achievements are attainable without a significant investment in time.  While there are a few keyboard options available (Reload, EMP, and Time Warp), all  you need is a mouse to play (but be prepared to do some clicking...lol). Only drawback that I can see is that there is no ""Quit"" button, but hitting the [esc] key is their substitute for one (gives you the option to quit).  Not mentioned anywhere, but hey, now you know...Fun game.  Check it out.(Tip: to get the hardest achievement ""Skyhawk Massacre"" without a lot of grinding, replay Mission 17 over and over and let your Harriers from the carrier do the work.  There are 12 skyhawks that attack right off the bat, so you can rack them up fairly quickly without an unreasonable amount of effort...)			"

												As you may guess, there ins't much to expect from this game.Fist of all, I got Battle Group 2 in a bundle I recently bought, its actual price being about 20 cents. If you have to spend more than that I wouldn't recommend this game.Now, about the game: it's really simple, just point and shoot enemies with your missiles/cannons, while going through the seas on auto-pilot. You then get money to spend in upgrading/buying ships.Not much to say about graphics, somewhat standard-issue which doesn't leave a mark.In the end, it's a fun and short game. Also, its short missions are able to fill small waiting times while you're sitting in front of your pc.But again, I would've never paid full price for this.			"

												Battle Group 2 is not bad, and it is reasonably priced.  I would however say that battlegroup 1 was a better game.  Battle Group 1 had more variety of enemies and your own ships were also more varied.  Graphically Battle Group 2 is better, but the levels are very short and are only made challenging by the volume of missile spam.  The addition of the power up system also makes the game less interesting and challenging.If you do choose to buy this game and enjoy it, I recommend you also go play Battle Group 1.  Or just go play that first.			"

												A very simple top down type shooter where your in command of a fleet which needs to get from point A to point B while taking on waves of enemies. The game is very simple and enjoyable for those wanting something to just play around with while waiting for something to load or waiting for your next match in COD or Overwatch. The story is very basic and straight forward with you dealing with a threat and that's really it. Now there are boss battles and a good mixture of enemy units to deal with so your not getting too bored of battling the same things. There is also a bunch of customization options for you to pick such as different ship to use, different escort ships to protect you and abilities to improve your weapons or armor or simply slow mo the area so you can take everyone out without breaking a sweat. Again a very simple and time killer game.			"

												First of all I got this on sale for 79 cents. I don't think I'd pay $8 for it. It is fun though. I probably will play it again but it feels like one of those games to play when you're really bored. If you played stuff like Missle Command when you were a kid and loved it you'll like this. You control ships and click where enemies are heading to send out your missles and catch them. The descriptions for the ships you can purchase using oil, the game's currency, is really vague so you'll probably buy some stuff you don't like thinking it'll be an upgrade to what you currently have since it's cost is higher. It states the ship's abilities, just no description as to what the abilities do. I haven't played very much but it's a pretty simple game. Aim, shoot, buy, slightly upgrade, accidentally downgrade. Overall pretty fun game.			"

The idea for the gameplay is to track the enemy plains movement, in order to corgate with  the delay of the missiles you fire. Between stages you can buy upgrads to your ship, or even buy new ship with new abbilites such as a turrent, that fires extra shots, a decoi missle that makes your enemies fire at the decot, and helecoppterts that destoys enemie missiles.The game is very fun and simple, thumps up. 6 out of 10			"

												Imagine playing the original Missile Command game where you defended your cities from incoming threats. Now place that same game concept against a naval back-drop where your ships (or ships) are coming under attack.Seen from directly above, BG2 focuses on quick reactions and that constant battle between overwhelming firepower and conserving your ammunition. Your task is to fend off inbound enemies from your vessels by a arch-rival known only as The Talon. Each ship has a weapons system that reloads and recharges over time. Larger ships tend to have more health, but they can be upgraded at the end of each level, using resources gained from destroying inbound bogeys and bonuses through killstreaks.The level of unit detail is really quite impressive. Any military g33k will immediately recognise B2 Spirit's, Tu-95 Bears, Su-25 Frogfoots - to name but a few. Some targets move quickly, others more docile. Some take a couple of hits, some can destroyed with a single shot. You can also have more than one ship in your immediate flotilla - mixing and matching each ships capabilities to maximise your chances of success.Overall BG2 is a straight forward and very rewarding game to play. Easy to pickup and play - there are many combinations available to the player in terms of how to proceed. One of those games that's great when you have 10 minutes spare.8.5/10			"

												Battle Group 2 is not a complicated game. You are in command of a gunship that finds itself being attacked by a mysterious organization called “The Talon” which is very reminiscent of Cobra from GI Joe. After a short tutorial, they threaten an airliner and you are forced to give them your ship. Out for revenge, you start level one with a much smaller ship, and start hunting down the Talon. Some humorous dialogue aside there really isn’t much to the game’s plot, and with good reason.. Battle Group embraces an old arcade style sensibility and is really all about the game play.When it comes to games like these all that really matter is gameplay, and in that aspect Battle Group 2 delivers. If you are looking for a fun game to play in short bursts. Or if you just want arcade style fun, you can do a lot worse for the $7.99 it’ll cost you to pick Battle Group 2 up.			"

What a great little game!It's a very simple premise where your sole responsibility is to fire the missiles to both defend the ship from incoming missiles, and also to attack the enemy planes, etc.  While you progress through the 31 Missions you upgrade your primary ship (health and number of missiles it can fire) and your escort ship (types of support it provides and how often).The Good:+ Nice graphics+ Fun+ Although a simple game, it actually has a campaign, and 31 levels at that!+ Not too easy. Not too hard.+ Audio.  The radio chatter in the background (when your support ship is ready, etc) sounds great with head phones.+ Different ships as you upgrade.  Four types of primary attack ships, and four types of support ships.The Eh:~ The highest level attack ship is slightly over-powered compared to all the others, and makes the game much easier.  It's not a small increase in power, it's major.  But, it's still a lot of fun.The Bad:- It's short is about the worst you can say, and that's because it's so fun you want more!I completed the campaign in basically 3 hours flat.  And to do this, I had to recomplete some earlier levels to upgrade my ships.  Once upgraded, then I could proceed further.  Very nice!  The rest of my time was spent replaying and getting 4-stars on as many levels as I could.  Still couldn't get 4 stars on 4 of the levels.  It was fun trying though.For such an inexpensive game, it's a lot of fun for a few hours and highly recommended.  8 out of 10. "

												This game has been sitting in my library for a long time. Never touched, collecting dust like many of the other titles that I have amassed over the years. I'm not sure what made me doqnload this game today of all days, but I will say that it was worth the couple minutes if time that it took me to download it.Though I have yet to finish the campaign, this game takes me back to the days when I would run up to the arcade machine at your local laundry mat and play till my little heart contented, trying to beat the high scores left by an unknown stranger.This game takes a very interesting spin on the classical arcade plane shooter game, having the occassional boss and other challenges. The missions are not very long, and this game would be a great thing to play if you only have a couple of minutes at work or before class.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the old arcade shooters that you would pay a quarter for a certain amount of lives at the arcade for. Great blast to the past for me.			"

												Best way I can describe it - Missile Command if your missile bases, the enemies, and the cities to protect - ALL were moving around at the same time.   VERY hectic without the power ups ... the time freeze power up makes it a *teenie* bit too easy IMO, but a fun game with solid responsive controls (devs actually took the time to make a solid PC port *insert gasp here*).The storyline is ... skethcy at best.  And wish there were a few more levels (31 total), but for the price it's a steal - a nice retro 'cade game with a modern look.  :)			"

												The game is a basic arcade shoot-em-up. You are in control of two ships, a primary vessel geared towards attacking and a secondary vessel with a variety of support options.The game's story is Command and Conquer with you playing as the UN versus NOD, for some reason. The dialogue is a bit simple and nonsensical. The gameplay is standard fare except for the nature of your weapons. There is a delay between when you fire and when you hit so for fast moving enemies (all of them) you have to lead. A lot of enemies also bob and weave meaning you have to be good at predicting their next position. The levels themselves are largely samey and are very short in length. There are some gimmicks in levels, such as your vessels getting split up, having to defend civilians and night battles but its really the same thing again and again. At least for me, the combat was satisfying because of that delay and it is satisfying to blow up enemies and watch the debris fall into the water.The sound design is steller. You get nice ambient radio chatter, satisfying explosion sounds and distinctive noise made by each enemy and missle type. On the whole, I'd say its a nice short arcade blaster worth its budget price.			"

												This is a fun casual game that can be finished in 3 or 4 hours. It's worth $4 priced at $1 / hour of fun.You play a gunner, on a ship that is captained by a lovely and competent young woman. The enemy faction is named Talon and headed by a guy who wears a red tablecloth on his head. Talon delights in hijacking airplanes and your ship. You have to defend against small bomber planes, fighters, stealth bombers, helicopter gunships, 747's, small inflatables and various missiles.The challenge comes from the fact that your captain is steering the ship from left to right and the enemy tends to attack right to left and eventually from all directions. Your missile launcher holds a maximum of 5 missiles ( before needing to reload ) and different enemies can take 1,2 or 3 shells before they are destroyed. You have to prioritize targets and make judgements, based on relative velocity, regarding the impact point of when and where your missiles will hit.You can use barrels of oil, to purchase friendly ships, that will sail beside you. You can purchase power ups such as one that will slow down time.			"

It took me about three hours to finish without trying to finish it (you can go back to earlier levels if you want to earn more cash to unlock better upgrades).  It has a bit of Missile Command to it if you're old enough to remember that game, in that you spend some effort timing incoming missiles and figuring out the lead to allow.  The secondary weapons are a great addition, and they're easy to use.Definitely a fun game you can pick up and play in about 10 seconds.			"

												First Impressions:It's ""Missile Command"" but with naval vessels.  The AI will pilot your vessel(s) across multiple campaign levels and you'll be tasked with shooting all the baddies off the map (before they do the same to you).  You can buy a second vessel which provides a secondary weapon.  Each ship (primary or secondary) each have different stats and abilities so you can customize your experience a bit.  Destroying enemies and doing well will earn you the fuel you need to unlock said ships and upgrade them.  All in all, a pretty fun game.

												This game is surprisingly fun. It plays a bit like Missile Command. You play the part of a ship or fleet trying to defend against incoming enemies. You have to fire ahead of them because your weapons have travel time. You can upgrade your ships, buy new ones. It's a very short game, 2-3 hours. There's not a lot of variety in the ships. But it was a fun way to pass the time. I certainly wouldn't recommend this at full price, but if it hits 75%+ off, one of the Steam sales, then it may be worth a look.			"

												Yeah, OK.  I love this little game.  It's quirky, fun, and easy to play.  Got it in a very inexpensive bundle. way, WAY worth it.  Got my giggles and fun. A mix of 1942, missle command and a few others. WELL worth playing. pros: -definately fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.-runs on linux (but achievements do not work:FYI)-simple controls-easy learning curve-kids say female lead is ""way awesome""-trading cards. though I don't care some folks might.cons:-scaling issue  (FIXED!) -Achievements do not work under Linux-Devs have no Linux test box. Uh... takes 20 min to fix that?...It's unity3d?  -no overall volume control (can adjust music only) -cannot shoot into/under the left side overlay. Needs ""expert mode"" where keys are used instead of the overlay.-game is somewhat short. 31 levels.  Could use more. Have yet to try Big Picture'ing it or using a gamepad. But so far, AWESOME!As our Heroine says:""Thank you Taxpayers!""			"

												Battle Group 2 is a decent enough, though admittedly shallow indie game where you control the gunner of a warship. The plot is bare-bones, having only you and your captain facing off against the ""Talon"", suspiciously similar to another evil organization. The Talon has a huge fleet of everything from B-2s to speedboats, and you have to sink it. The gameplay is very simple, consisting of clicking the mouse (you can't steer), and clicking on power ups or special abilities. The way to deal missiles is to either trigger a power-up or shoot them down. Though there is skill involved, this can be mitigated with power-ups. By the end of the game, I was just replaying earlier levels to grind for cash, buying power-ups, and using them to make it through the harder end levels. Because of this, the game isn't deep at all and has little replay value, but is a good way to spend several hours.			"

												Make no mistake, this certainly isn't a terrible game, but I've played better, and it's got a lot to do with how it's only difficult due to poor design choices.Simply put, those new ships and upgrades you can buy and upgrade over the course of the game? Not optional. Not in the slightest. You're going to notice early on that your performance is kind of hamstrung by the fact that ALL of your ships have an absolutely abysmal reload rate, and the only way you're going to remotely keep up with the increasing onslaughts that the enemies throw at you is to upgrade your clip sizes and reload rates to the max as early on as you can - and when I say reload rate, I don't mean the reload rates for your main gun, which you cannot upgrade the reload rate of by any means.Well, that's not so bad, you may say, doesn't that add to the challenge of the game?It does. Right up until you start realizing that you are literally having too many enemies and missiles thrown at you to shoot down unless you buy a lot of expensive single-use powerups, and I mean expensive as in ""you will have to grind entire early-to-mid-game missions at least once to buy a single pack of the only truly useful one"", and that's not even factoring what it's going to take to get the late-game ships and upgrades that, again, you're absolutely going to NEED in order to stand a chance.Basically, you can't beat this game without grinding like crazy, and that's not challenging. It's a timesink and nothing more. It's really too bad, because there's really not much wrong with the game itself - it's simple, good, lead-the-target fun that allows you the chance to negate all damage if you're quick and accurate enough... at least until the game starts throwing too much at you to handle without the need for powerups. I did beat the game, but I didn't four-star every mission, and the ending isn't worth it. I have my doubts that 100%ing the game is worth the time it'll take to beat it, and I personally can't recommend this game unless you wait for a rather hardcore discount; it's not worth eight dollars.

												The best way I can think to describe this game is as a top-down scrolling 'Missile Command' style game.  You click on a spot, and a missile flies there, making you have to lead your targets a bit so you hit them.  The challenge of the game comes from racking up hit streaks to increase your score.All told, it was fun for a bit, but gets repetitive rather quickly.  I've played it for about two hours, and I don't see myself coming back to it.  As a quick timer killer, it isn't bad.  But wait for it to go on sale, maybe?			"

I got 31 levels. Each one ends in less than 5 minutes. You'll want to go back and farm though and also max out your score. Just because!After you have maxed out your top ships, it can be a different kind of fun to go back to the weaker ships, max out their perks, then see how well you can do on the same levels with the weak ships when you know enough to better anticipate what's coming.Levels are largely scripted, but I noticed some degree of randomness. I wouldn't mind a ""randomness slider"" setting to increase replayability of levels but hey, good game from a small group people as it stands.Also: LOL Spain knocked out			"

												      A simple point and click naval wargame that delivers an enjoyable, albeit simple, experience. The game boasts some very nice graphics (especially the warships) and some interesting sound design (especially in the menus), and is overall a fun, small game. If you want something that looks like Capcom's 1942, (I bought the game solely because it reminded me of custom naval units like the Arm Yamato for Total Annihilation back in the day), and plays as simply as your average tower defense game, you might enjoy this game. There is some nice music, but not enough of it. After the first few missions the game doesn't really change too much, but unlocking ships (with their unique weapons) is a rewarding enough reason to keep playing.       I recommend this game, but I'd add the caveat that only if it appeals to you, and if it is on sale.			"

												Got it as part of a HumbleBundle, so it probably only cost me 30 cents.   30 cents....or even a buck...for 11+ hours of game play?  That's worth it.The game is basically a mobile platform-style game where you have one or two battleships and you cruise along shooting planes down.  There's a story, but it doesn't matter, and the campaign is super short and easy.  The achievements are a huge portion of the game hours, and that's because you have to grind out thousands of kills.  So, bottom line is, it's mindless fun to kill some casual hours.  If you get it with something, it's worth it...but if you had to pay anything more than a buck, it's over-priced.			"

												I'd describe this as a kind of Missile Command style game.  Instead of defending cities, you're battling through hordes of aircraft, missiles, and suicide boats using the weapons featured on the boat(s) you're using.  Each boat is upgradable, and some weapons are automatic, some are controlled manually.It's a cheap game - just over a fiver - but does give you quite a bit of gameplay, and getting the achievements will take some time.  (There are guides on Steam to help you.)If you're looking for deep strategy, look elsewhere, but as a fun arcade experience, you could do a lot worse than give this a try.			"

A buck for a couple hours of excitement is a good deal I reckon.The achievements may be broken on Linux as I have 100%'d the game w/ no achievement unlocks.			"

												There's no such stick that you should use to touch this product. Battle Group 2 must be serious upgrade to Battle Group 1 but I couldn't tell since I've never seen or heard about it. BG2 is on-rails shooter in veins of old-school shareware games with the depth of something that's not deep. I can't remember this steaming pile of boat loving cruiser crap to anyone. Steer clear.

												The presentation is bare to the bone, revealing the game's mobile roots. The ""story"" is just an excuse to move from a level to another and it's of b-movie-like quality. Anyway you know what? The game is fun. Simple arcade fun. If you liked Missile Command back in the past you'll love this. Additionaly, even if the action is basically always the same (shoot at stuff), there's a good amount of variety in the later levels. At full price is only for hard core arcade action enthusiasts, discounted is almost for everyone who wants some simple and relaxing fun that can be played with just a mouse.			"

												Accidentaly bought this some time ago and was pleasantly surprised. Not a very long game, but I had fun.You start the game and you're instantly thrown right into the battle, hardly no loading or menu to distract you just straight in and FIRE YOUR GUNS OR YOU WILL DIE! Basically you're the gunner on a huge military ship, you have no backstory (or story for that matter) and like I said, you need to shot stuff. Sooner or later they will cover the entire screen. Stay alive for long enough for the ship to go from left to right until you go so far right the game ends.The captain of the ship have some quarrel with some other captain and that is who you're being attacked by. He's generic evil guy, intentionally. Because he has nothing to do with this game. This game is about shooting stuff.			"

												      A simple point and click naval wargame that delivers an enjoyable, albeit simple, experience. The game boasts some very nice graphics (especially the warships) and some interesting sound design (especially in the menus), and is overall a fun, small game. If you want something that looks like Capcom's 1942, (I bought the game solely because it reminded me of custom naval units like the Arm Yamato for Total Annihilation back in the day), and plays as simply as your average tower defense game, you might enjoy this game. There is some nice music, but not enough of it. After the first few missions the game doesn't really change too much, but unlocking ships (with their unique weapons) is a rewarding enough reason to keep playing.       I recommend this game, but I'd add the caveat that only if it appeals to you, and if it is on sale.			"

												Yes, it's worth $3 on sale! It's really fun for about 40 mins before it gets a bit repetetive but it's a great casual timewaster/bullet hell kinda shooter. If you ever played Missile Command on Atari, then you are familiar with this. Lots of upgrades but they are pretty much on a standard set path without the ability to really deviate and no different strategies to employ, but it's $3 and it has slick production. Just do it!			"

												I do recommend this game, however if you are on a Mac you will have to restart all of your progress every time you close/open the game. Did a little research and it appears that late June/early July the devs said they were working on it, however as of 08/04/14 the mac version still does not save. If you like arcade style games it is very fun and quite addicting IMO. I would definitely buy it and play it a little, then maybe wait for an update (it gets very annoying playing for and hour and then having to restart all over again)			"

												If I hadn't picked Battle Group 2 up in a game bundle, I likely would never have even known it existed. That said, it's actually not a bad game, considering how shallow the gameplay is.The game's easy to complete in a couple of hours, and has exactly enough content to make it feel like it's worth finishing without being tedious. Some of the achievements are a bit ridiculous (grinding out thousands of kills), but if you're not a completionist then it's not a big deal.The gameplay is simple: fire guns at incoming missiles and enemies, and try not to get hit. You can upgrade your ships, and there are a few power skills you can use when things start getting rough.I absolutely would not pay full price for this ($7.99 at the moment), but if you can get it for a couple bucks and enjoy arcade style gaming, it's worth picking up.

I finished everything but the grind achievements (Kill 1000 of X) within 3 hours. There are similar games for free on sites like Kongregate.com and the asking price of 7.99€ is absurd for a game of so litle content. I got the game at a 85% discount and consider this the upper limit for a game with only 3 hours gametime. If you like grindy, shallow point-and-click shooters you can probably squezze more gametime out of this. I cant , and so I cant recommend it.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Monorail  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsAll Resolution sizes are available.You can play the game windows or full screen mode.About the game.The game is basically monorail and the only thing what you are able to do is shooting enemies. You can't move around and you can buy boats by ""oil barrels"" You have to kill enemies or building in order to get those. A higher streak will give you more Oil. You can also upgrade the boats.  You can get a streak if you kill enemies, however if u shoot miss the streak will be broken. You can have 2 boats and one is a Support boat and the other one is you.The game has some audio voices. but not that much. You can get up to 3 stars but this is only for 100% completion on a level.You have some abilities to slow down time.Pretty Repetitive.Other things.Discount recommended.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"
