												A realtime strategy space battle game where, instead of directly ordering ships to move, you ""flick"" them like rubber bands. The setting and art are very unique, but...This game is a laundry list of ""it could have been good if...""if they had ditched the gimmicky flicking and just made it a standard RTSif it was turned based instead of real time so you could manage all the crap (it actually seems like it was meant to be turn based but was changed at the last second)if you could actually issue orders while pausedif the controls weren't so choppy that you end up deselecting the unit half the time you go to ""flick""The end result is just a mess of fiddling with the annoying flicking mechanic while your ships are shot up in real time with no real ability to pause because you can't pre-order flicks while paused. There are special abilites that differentiate the ships, but most of them also require flicks and aren't worth the hassle. Both building ships and using abilities take the same money resource, but you recover money so quickly that it's never a factor. The only limiting factor is the player's time and attention flicking ships one at a time. Special abilities aren't worth using because that's time you could have spent building more ships (which also requires a flick on the contructing ship) and flicking them towards the enemy.This could have worked turn based. This could have worked without flicking. This could have worked with the ability to issue orders and flicks while paused. But none of those are true so the game just plain doesn't work. It's a shame because from an artistic standpoint it's great. The gameplay is just horrid though.			"

												This game gets 10/10 for the intro video, story and concept and I really wanted to like it but I got frustrated within a matter of minutes of playing the first mission. This game simply doesn't work as an RTS with the flicking mechanics. It needs to be turn based.Out of a desire to give it a second chance though I attempted to play multiplayer but when no one showed up in the lobby I ended up launching the game against AI instead. I'm glad I did. Playing against a real person would have been a nightmare. The AI isn't remotely challenging - the challenge is simply in navigating anywhere on the map without crashing into something and exploding.After colonising the nearest planet I set my sights on the nearby enemy planet. I spent a couple minutes building units, linked them to a frigate and flicked them across space... only for an outlying torpedo ship to clip one of the cheese moons and send the entire fleet bouncing wildly in the opposite direction and straight into the gravity well of a planet. Survivors: 0.So having discovered the... excessive physics properties of these moons I rebuilt the fleet, launched more carefully and avoided the moons... only for a wormhole to appear in front of me and result in the entire fleet crashing headfirst into a planet on the other side of the system. Survivors: 0.Unsure how I was expected to know that was going to happen or what I possibly could have done about it I tenuously rebuilt the fleet again, this time split and linked to two separate frigates on the basis that surely at least one would not die horribly and unpredictably. I flicked them carefully again and promptly crashed into an enemy ship that just happened to choose that moment to cross my path. Half the fleet was immediately sucked into the nearest planet having lost most of its momentum whilst the others ended up drifting idly into the nearby mothership. Survivors: unknown.Rather than attempt to flick these units to safety one by one I decided to make the best out of it and send the other half of the fleet in to attack. In my haste however I failed to notice the small half dead patrol ship left in my path from the first failed attempt which the fleet promptly crashed into before bouncing off, hitting a cheese moon, then a second, then a third before finally crashing into two of my henships, knocking them into the planet and getting sucked in themselves. Survivors: 0.At this point I was beginning to question the strategic nature of this game.Since two of the AI players had spent the entirety of the game thus far with an equal number of henships perpetually colonising/sterilising the same planet I was, remarkably, still in the lead. However the victory bar was less than half full and I didn't much fancy the prospect of building another dozen ships with a shorter life expectancy than the Titanic so I decided to concede my victory. Well, I say 'concede' I actually just ordered my mothership to fly directly into the nearest planet and take all my henships with it convinced this would be the surest way of ending the game.Unbeknownst to me however the game just replaces your mothership almost immediately. It just never ends...If you are unsure if you will like this game then try to imagine playing your favourite RTS only where half the units you build instantly die and the rest can only be moved via a slingshot every ten seconds. If that sounds like your idea of fun then you should probably get this game.			"

												Conflicks - Revolutionary Space Battles, is a advanced real-time strategy spaceship game where you conquer planets and defeating your enemie in either singleplayer or multiplayer for retribution, resources, love, and.... Chickens.You currently have 21 missions in the singleplayer campagin, and 4 imperial houses to play as. The game offers 8 ships per faction with each fully functional special abilitys to blow up the enemies main house. The game feel already finished with it unique style and it's interesting, majestic  storyline. The intro makes you hold your hands together while watching it, and the ingame experience runs smoothly. The torturial part throws you directly into basics and how the game works, the advanced usage of your units and holding down your planets for resources.Every mission has a background story and a reason for it's action to have a natural feeling before we  go to combat. In every game there is either, black holes, asteroids, moons, cheese moons, and much more. Every player has a limited start of resources to build up a army to defeat the enemie in a solid and great space environment, in either easy, normal or hard mode.If you like space games within a interesting storyline, solid and fluid space environment in a real-time strategie game to conquer planets and enemies in either singleplayer or multiplayer, then this game is for you. - And for you who sits on different platform, then this game will also be availabe for mac and linux at its final release.

Early Access Review
								This ain’t your colonel’s chickenThis game is currently in Early Access, With time the review could change along with the game. This is a game that knows full well what it is.Bordering on breaking the 4th wall, and never taking itself seriously this game tells a story of love in space, with chickens thrown in to spice things up.Merging time periods, with a unique art style and game play, and as someone on another review I had read said “Monty Python in space” I’ll take it, and not only will I take it, I’ll love it. At the time of writing this I’ve only played some of the story for one of the four factions. But hands down this is one of the best strategy titles I’ve had the pleasure of reviewing.I’m not going to touch much on the story itself, as that should be experienced to get the full impact of the humor as well as delivery of it.But the gameplay, well, that’s awesome too. The game is top down strategy/RTS. You take planets, and you use resources to build ships and move them. No resources, you’re not going to be going anywhere.The best way I can describe the game mechanics is think of the “board” as a big pool table, in space where there are chickens. The physics react kind of like that. Smacking a ship with another will send it tumbling about, sometimes (even your own ships) smashing into a planets surface to it’s fire filled end. Just think of the chickens won’t you?From the developers website“Our intention is to combine the chaos produced by the laws of physics governing the movement of many ships at once to the depth of a good RTS in order to create an accessible game experience that can also turn into something quite challenging for more involved players.”They succeeded. This could easily be one of the top time sinks of 2015 for me due to the ease of access as well as the depth that it can hold.This game takes strategy and turns it on it’s head, and makes it a blast to sit down with. My son was walking by and he saw it and had to comment about the chickens and how much fun it looked to play.I’m not sure if it is or not, but this is a game that I could see being put onto mobile, or tablets. The gameplay begs for it with the “flicking” mechanic. With this you click and drag and a line appears that shows you roughly where your ship will go/fire. You release and then there goes your ship. It doesn’t always work in your favor and sometimes you’ll end up a little close than you wanted, or really far away.Despite this the game isn’t broken, the physics become another contender in the fight and there is no side that is super-powered death machines of feathers. It’s fair combat, which is refreshing. You can manage to start out the gate behind, but pull ahead because of your tactics and using the battlefield to your advantage. One of the issues I have with strategy games lately is that if you mess up early, it’s nearly impossible to come back from and you get steamrolled quickly. Thankfully this game actually tried to be a strategy game, and depending on your usage, less can be more. Often games will take the route of zerg rush = game win, we don’t need more of those. We need more space chickens.Last topic would be the soundtrack is glorious. Epic and campy, I would often find myself sitting on the menu while the game ran just for the music even when offline (steam has not correctly tracked my playtime).My only complaint, and it’s nothing against the game is that none of my friends have this. I would love to zip around in space with them either as a team, or just to see who can knock the other out of orbit. As of now, all I can say is this is a game that you need to have in your library. Humor, tactics, immersive, Artifice Studio’s my top-hat is off to you.Bravo. "

												This is a positive review, but I am hesitant in recommending the game.The most important thing about the game is, that its fun!But it has its issues, just like any other games.Pros: Unique gameplayEnjoyable game mechanicsLots of room for stragegyEasy to play, hard to master.Upgrades based on progressionCons:Multiplayer only offers 4 player Free for all.Very small player base, you will most likely face AI's unless playing at peak time or with friends.Cannot vote for maps (can leave lobby and join another one for new random map)Some maps are not exactly enjoyable (looking at you moon maps).No AI difficultyIn the end, the game is enjoyable but feels lackluster on core features such as a 2 versus 2 game mode. Still worth the purchase in my opinion, especially if you are gonna play with 3 friends :)Having to always play against friends, gets old, fast.			"

												If your the kind of player who's willing to let some technical gripes slide for an immersive world and story this game should suck you right in, if you're reading this you've probably noticed all the negative reviews criticizing the controls. And yeah, the flick system is a little annoying and the fact you can't pause then issue commands and unpause makes the game a bit clunky, but imo it's not as bad as everyone makes it seem. Once you pick up the controls it evens out.Now for some other opinions, as previously mentioned the story and world are interesting but the singleplayer campaings seem more like extended tutorials for the 4 nations, with a small storyline for a character for each. Not that there's anything wrong with this, but the AI feels stuck on tutorial level difficulty the whole time. Although on a related note the 4 factions I just mentioned are actually pretty well balanced. I saw another review mention this but it's true. after playing through some games with different factions, none felt too powerful or too weak and with 4 factions that's real nice			"

Early Access Review
								A funny and yet compelling game base on the simple concept of flinking your ships to position rather just point and clicking your way towards the destination.The art style and humor of this game keeps is separated from the competition while the flicking mechanic makes it intriquing and compelling enough.Even though the campain can be challenging [God damn it Antonio!!!!] it dose a good job at introducing the players to the faction mechanics before dropping litterraly all that you have just learned towards the end.The gameplay by design is more focused on the micro management since you simply can not flick more then one ship at the time unless you use a Frigate, and even that is not exacly macro gameplay, you just attach your ships to one and shoot them into space in hope a vessel dosen't bump into a rando asteroid and blocks your entire ball.Even though the ships by them self have the same base stats, it's the skills that each one posses that can change the flow of the battle. For exemple I found that if the AI leaves the mothership alone for a good amount of time, taking a Greater Britan corvette with the shield on can cause as much damage as a well dispached torped, just distract them long enough for the bigger guns to move in.The physics are just the ice on the cake and good players will be able to make the best of it while also efficently using all the skills in your arsenal and constantly pouring out new ships to send to the frontline.Moving each ship can be, however, frustating or stressing simply because you have to aim each and every one of them in order to not screw your self by bumping your own troops into their doom.Not much to say on the options since it's a 2D game with a cartoon art style the only effective change to the quality is the screen resolution.Overall it's a fun game that I'd wish I could try in a deathmatch PvP game but right now the community seems too small as the game has passed under the Steam radar. Here one hopes it's actual relase date brings some much needed attention. Sad to say some skills or factions might end up not fully balanced because of the lack of PvP players to test it.			"

Early Access Review
								Conflicks is a Phsyics Focused real-time strategy game, with quirky humor and it's fair share of yolks.Overall, the game is good if you enjoy physics puzzlers, as you will need to get used to the flick mechanic to function in-game. The main litmus test I would present to anyone curious if they should buy this game or not: ""Would this movement system hinder your enjoyment of an RTS?"" Main reason for presenting it like that, is you use flick for almost everything, it's like a rubber-band shot, and would transition exceptionally well to mobile devices if the devs ever decide to go that route. As for doing it with a mouse, I felt it was just kind of ""meh"" to control my ships like that.Let's look at the rest of the game though:Pros:- Quirky and fun story, a little dry at places, but enjoyable none the less (sometimes get a ""trying too hard"" vibe)- Aesthetic is pleasing, and holds an almost ""Monty Python Animation"" feel to it.- The Vocals and audio assets are well done, adding to the atmosphere of the game.Neutral:- Simple strategies, but overall necessary due to the involvement of physics as a core mechanic (though the physics are strategies in and of themselves)- Ships have a movement cooldown, so your aim better be good.- Movement, Actions, and Unit Generation all utilize one core resource (it regenerates quickly, but you can create a big ship and be caught by not being able to move another ship for a moment).Cons:- Some of the animations are too long, almost grindy feeling. While a lengthy animation can add impact, when it's key animations or ones you see frequently, it can get inhibiting to the player.- Hard to use complex tactics because the flick mechanic can act as an inhibitor, you're not going to be doing near as much micromanaging here as in, say, starcraft or C&C.Note:- You learn about 'pausing' in the campaign, a few chapters in, It would seem like this should be in the basic tutorials or first story mission.- The tutorials themselves are unnecessary, you actually have most of what you need explained to you via the campaign (and it gets redundant if you do the tutorials first, then do the campaign)Overall, I can recommend this game, provided it passes the litmus test for you. It's a good game, just definitely appealing to a niche audience in the physics aspect.If you'd like to see the game in action, here's a video created after about an hour of testing:

								Conflicks - Revolutionary Space Battles is space strategy game.....with chickens....chickens who fly spaceships... yes.There is 4 chicken nations, with unique ships, buuut waaait, game is very very well balanced, so there is no OP faction here,I dont think any RTS will be balanced as StarCraft, but it is pretty close to that level.P.S. Im not fan of StarCraft, but I admit that they made it great.Gameplay really brings freshness to strategy genre, its wicked, totaly absurd but most of all it is FUN !Controls are easy, cool and FUN ! But waaaaait... You must play tutorial to get it ! Cutscenes have great artwork, cool story, and lots of chickens, yes FUN !Music is following all that madness to complete the story of this FUN ! gameGraphic is nicely detailed, beautiful colors, especialy when you drop chickens on planets, FUN !Biggest potential this game I see in multiplayer, yes you remember I spoke of StarCraft, 100% FUN ! guaranteedOnly thing I see lacking in-game is building option and mode, I would reeaally like to build some more structures, especially defensive, I dont want to leave ships guarding my planets, me want buildings, space-stations ! Oh silly me... chickens can't build... Ok, enough of this !Graphic: 9/10Sound:   8/10Gameplay: 10/10If you need game to play with friends, look no more, this is game for you !Also recommended to all chicken fans.			"

								The artwork is quite impressive, a surprisingly good amount of polish on details and story elements.  However where this game breaks down is in the gameplay. With units spread across a map and the requirement of micromanging single unit abilities through a crude interface in realtime, I found it more frustrating than anything. It becomes obvious that this was originally designed as a turn based game but then somewhere in the design process they decided to make it realtime. There is just too much to do in the small window of time you have, it seems too overwhelming.I actually liked the flicking mechanic and the physics elements, it's the rest of the game that takes away from the fun.

Early Access Review
								A fascinating blend of launch style physics game play and RTS mechanics.  Players use meta matter top preform all actions in the game.  From creating units to ""moving"" units by dragging and launching them through various effects.  Ships can also use meta-matter to preform a number of special actions based on their faction and class.  Meta-matter its self is generated by both the players flag ship and as well as captured planets.   The mechanical base is fairly compact but offers a wide range of depth with the interaction of various space hazards and ship abilities.  Matches tend to be shorter (15-30 minutes) this is nice if you don't want to spend hours playing ""sim city"" which can happen with some RTS games.The single player story is both humerous and compelling in its absurdity.  Both strange and unique, the game is set in a sci-fi post-renaissance (the late 1700s or so) with an art style the matches its mood.  Players will encounter various historical figures and anologues.  The missions feel varied enough but not overly difficult for an experienced RTS player.  The single player does its job though in both being a good introduction to the mechanics of the game and entertaining with its characters and plot.Currently there are not many people in the multiplayer which is unfortunate as there is little doubt abilities will need tweaking and balancing, not to mention that the multiplayer maps seam well designed.  Multiplayer games are a bit different from the single player in that each person plays to a score limit.  Score (as far as I can tell) is given for destroying ships, building ships and capturing meta-matter.  Destroying an enemies flag ship is worth a great deal of points but they do appear to re-spawn after (this was my experience fighting AIs in the ""friendly"" multiplayer mode).I got this game with the two for one value and at 10 dollars I feel it is worth the price.  The single player alone was highly entertaining and the potential mutliplayer strategies promise to be fun.   I do hope this game gets more attention so there are more players online, but if not you can always get together with friends if you have a few to game with.One last thing to note is that ships improve in power based on accomplishing some of the single player campaigns and by using them in multiplayer.   Given the low number of players online it is hard to tell how much of a good idea this is.  While progression can be distracting it may be problematic for the balance of new players vs old players.

												Conflicks - Revolutionary Space Battles is a really unique game in my opinion. Renaissance in space is what it comes down to. In this alternate history humans discovered  a new, powerful form of matter inside the yolk of hen eggs. This led to a technological singularity that catapulted humanity into space in the 1600- 1700's. Humanity is now among the stars with the help of this chicken egg matter, battling not only themselves but also sapient, sentient chicken mutants who have suddenly evolved.  Gameplay wise most combat will involve flicking ships through the battle map (pulling back on them and launching in a certain direction). This is also how most abilities work, from missiles to tractor beams. There are a handful of different ship classes from small fighter/scouts to behemoth capital ships and all sizes in between. Your capital ship usually acts as your base and primary shipyard for creating more units.  There are also a variety of factions but with the time I got to play Conflicks I did not experience most of them. I also did not get into any detailed multiplayer, having spent most of my time in the single player campaign.Overall I enjoyed what I did play, and thought the art style was pretty enjoyable and definitely unusual. I recommend the game to anyone looking for a new indy game, or anyone who is a fan of space battles. Conflicks is not a mobile game but I would recommend mobile fans play it because of its movement style.			"

												Hey I'm a bad RTS player, but I like it. I'm a big MOBA fan (Dota 2, SMITE, HOTS, LOL) (and a lot better at it) so I like competitive games... Confliks Is neither a RTS or a MOBA: it's its own genuine style (with influences of all kinds, like every creation in this world...). Strory is great, gameplay is hard and fun. For those salty persons who cant get the flicking or the fact its in real time, well its not for you! For those who like to learn a game and nail it (like most of the good games right?), for those who like to take the risk of dangerous flick that could create a funny fail or an awesome move and laught about it, for those who enjoy game design and graphic design made with love and commitment, its a game you should try (with and open mind, with some place for some chickens!)

												This is a very tentative recommendation. Conflicks does a LOT right - great art and style, excellently ridiculous setting, and ships with a good variety of abilities.That said, playing it just feels....off. I actually found the flick controls to work quite well, but the whole thing never quite clicked for me. I should note that I only played about half the campaign and some vs AI matches (during the free weekend), so it could be a very different beast against humans.Basically, Conflicks is ALMOST great. It has a lot going for it, but like a lot of people have said, it feels like it was designed to be turn-based but just sort of turned into an RTS at some point. I'd say try the demo, see if you like it, and decide from there.			"

												This game has a really great plot for a singleplayer - this is the material for some roleplaying game. Flicks mechanics are poor, true, but if one can endure those boring space battles with very low level AI then one can immerse itself into a pretty decent story with nice esthetics.The following is from singleplayer point of view:Pros:- style & esthetics of cutscenes - really great!- plot is interesting, makes me want to play more- the setting is really original- map of the world is greatCons:- err, the gameplay is really mediocre with this flicking mechanics- AI is so weak that beating stages is only a matter of timeAs many people pointed out - this would have been a really good game if it was turn based. To be totally honest - I was sucked in by the story and esthetics of cutscenes, but I've played this free access full version of the game. If I was to pay for this game I would have still enjoyed it but not that much.Buy it if you want to immerse yourself in a great and original setting but beware - the setting and the story are actually more interesting than the game itself. Please read other reviews just to make a smart decision.			"

												What an awesome game! Nice cutscenes and sounds. I disagree with most people here that say that this should have been turn-based. Since you are always capped at how much resources you have, if you like a game that reuires constant micro-management, that isnt a problem. I love these games with a newish concept. If you dont like constant clicking (flicking), dont get this. But for me, I love it!!!			"

												If the name of the developer-publisher, Artifice Studio, rings a bell for you then that is good, it should. Artifice Studios shocked us back in 2013 with their debut game, Sang-Froid – Tales of Werewolves. That game was held in extremely high regard for its fascinating and thoroughly well executed combination of action, strategy, RPG, tower defense game play. It was certainly among my favorite indie games developed that year. It took the studio two and a half years to release their second game, but again it is a deeply interesting game, in Conflicks – Revolutionary Space.I’d like to highlight the points of the game that I perceive to be a negative first. The game is played in a real-time fashion with a flicking mechanic. The flicking mechanic takes too long to do that at higher levels and harder difficulty settings so much is happening at once that it becomes incredibly difficult to keep up. The inability to pre-order moves on the pause screen only adds to this frustration. I can understand that the devs may view this as a level of cheating but it’s more of an unfortunate reality than a cheap way to win. What this means is that the difficulty level increases on an artificial level rather than a natural one. Rising rates of difficulty should almost always be natural. It should never be because the game is broken in any way, shape or form. Unfortunately, that’s what has happened here in my opinion. The game would have worked much better as a turn-based game with the utilization of the flicking mechanic. It really would have transformed the game for the best and made it a much stronger title. There are other issues that I have with the flicking mechanic as well. Far too many of the abilities rely on this mechanic. This again not only slows the game down because moves cannot be pre-orderedIt’s not all bad. In fact, I do believe that Conflicks is quite a solid title that could have been much better had better game design decisions been made. The highlight of the game for me is the overall presentation. This comes in the form of the graphic novel style approach to the narration of the story and the fantastic character writing especially that of the charming, talking owl Unlucky Locke. I couldn’t help but feel immersed in the game world. The campaigns serve as great tutorials to the multiplayer game. Unfortunately, there are very few players playing but the two multiplayer games that I managed to get into were entertaining battles let down only by the flick system. The presentation, however, mostly made up for that system and enabled me to have a good amount of fun.If you own Conflicks or intend to purchase it or end up winning a copy from Steamified please hit me up. I’d love to play a game or two with you!Conflicks is a flawed game but one that has a lot of charm in the presentation. It’s certainly worth some of your time so I urge you not to ignore this game.For similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/ "

												I actually would like to recommend this game, as it is an immensely creative piece of entertainment and I wish it gained more publicity. It's also quite fun. The campaign is somewhat interesting, but as any RTS game, it's really no fun playing alone.You probably watched the steam promo video, where the guys were playing vs each other. And it seemed quite interesting, right? Well, playing vs other people online is possible, but as there's basically no one playing this game (according to the steam statistics, you can check them yourself if you don't believe me), you just can't find other players to play with.Also, I really don't see the point of having your ships' ingame abilities improved by grinding steam achievements. That's just plain idiotic.I hope the devs drop this game into some -90% discount so that there would be more players. That way this game could be insanely fun.If things change, I'll be glad to change this review.			"

												It's a fresh way to do real time strategy with a great sense of humor and a good art style. You control ships by ""flinging"" them which is basically hitting 1 and pulling back so that the ship flys forward. It's a nice concept but it does lead to a lot of micro managing. Although, I don't feel like this destroys the game because of the simplicity that the game offers and because the first few missions give you time to get used to the system, I don't think it's a problem.  The physics system is rather refreshing too. Launching a missle at a meteor will send it flying depending on where you hit it. I feel that this adds some depth to the game. The game does feel aimed towards a younger audience and I think the typcial RTS player may find it boring or simply dumb as the way you control your ships is far from standard.Over all, it is a good game with a lot of creativity in it. It has some issues like ai not being as hard as you may want but I feel that because of to control system, this game was never meant to be hard but fun because of the wacky things you can do. I recommend this game because it is simply and fun to play.			"

												I couldn't even bear to finish tutorial, that's just how stupid it was. It asks too much of a micromanagement in a too short time frame. It is obvious that this game was initially developed as turn-based, but for some reason became real-time. Graphics are  good, but gameplay? Total crap.1) This game uses flicking, which is effectively drag&drop on mouse. Now go look at how similar games are made and in what manner they are different. Right, most of them were initially developed for touch screen. And succesful PC ones in general try to limit number of times you have to drag&drop because it is very taxing on hand compared to regular mouse movement.2) Micromanagement here asks you to manually control each ship, and do regular flicks to be successive because in most cases you can't flick ships far and travel often requires more than two flicks.It would all be okay if it was turn-based giving you time to catch a breath, but it is RTS, so 1) + 2) combined means what I said earlier: too much actions to do in too short time.Combine it with heavy stress on arm = bad choice. Me, with mild CTS limiting how long i can stress my arms with KB or mouse won't be able to play this game for any prolonged period of time. That's why I say NO. If you like that ridiculous challenge - okay, it's a good game for you. But not for me.			"

												Conflicks is one of the few games I have played in years that deserves adjectives like 'original' and 'fresh', if not 'innovative'.It's a hectic RTS at it's core, and you won't stand a chance without learning shortcuts, but there's a twist: you move your units by 'flicking' them across the map, which is a very interesting mechanic for a space setting. The game gains a surprising ammount of depth from it.The writing is great, the Humor and quality seen in the trailers is being kept up, the game absolutely is worth the 14.99 they ask, and personally - I'd buy it again for that.If you're up to a challenge, and feel like playing something original, go for it.

												Might be just my machine, but it's got a major bug that breaks the game. When I do a 'flick' action (which is basic movement for those who haven't played this yet), about half the time my mouse cursor disappears and the selected unit does not move. The only way to get my cursor back is to press escape to bring up the menu and then return to the game. Pretty impossible to play this game when you can't issue commands half the time.Other than that, the game does seem cool. Just wish I could play it.			"

												The game has an excellent AI, great graphics, epic background musics and a crazy story and characters that keeps you fighting for your survival where dangers come as much from your enemy vessels but also from the map elements (asteroid field, gas nebulas, planet gravity).Conflicks brings an original mechanic for a RTS that can be a bit challenging in the first missions, but become familiar and fun once you have played a few of them. I played all the solo campaign, it took me around 25 hours to complete the 21 missions, some missions were a bit difficult, a couple even frustrating where I had to retry 6 to 10 times before succeeding the mission but none were impossible, at least as normal difficulty mode. Overall I have enjoyed a lot playing the game so I would recommend it to people who like RTS and original space adventure games.			"

(All missing chunks are replaced with a blue box.)know as i said earlier this may just be my old DELL laptop with not much memory to spear and is very buggy.but if it isn't can you please try to attempt to fix these missing chunks.From a gamer with a bad laptop.

												I am a fan of sci-fi, history, funky humor, and finger flicking boardgames. Conflicks gives all of that in spades.  Grasping the intricacies of the gamepeplay requires an open mind and some practice, so don't give up if at first you don't succeed.  The fact that you have to use combos and special powers is a sign of sound design in my book.  It has a good balance between strategy and execution that requires some dexterity. It's quite challenging, to be honest, so be warned.I really appreciated the historical references sprinkled in the cutscenes of the single-player game.			"

												It's like being back in primary/elementary school playing with marbles, only now the marbles have guns. Artifice Studio, after creating Sang-Froid,  pulls of creating another mind-boggling genre hybrid, as fleet engagements are basically a giant game of Strategic snooker, or tactical péntanque, which is awesome.I'm not much for multiplayer, but as someone who loves the campaign portion of RTS, great atmosphere, novel mechanics and lovingly made products, I'd like to reccomend this game on those merits alone when you can get it for 10 quid or less.I had a wonderful time with the campaign. As you can tell from the intro, this is a strange beast in many ways, but the campaign's storyline is an honest and charming collection of 18th century tale telling. You've got your love-lorn British Privateer who will do anything to win the heart of his love, A Loyal French Female Musketeer looking for her father and a time traveling Spanish Monk who repeatedly tries to save his brother, while revolution is brooding. The drawings and artwork are fantastic and the voice acting cleverly replaced by striking sound effects. Love this game.Other than that, it has all the depth I need out of my RTS. There are no less then 4 different factions, each with a good variety of ships. Each of these ships have their own abilities. British ships can armor up, have blast weapons to knock enemy ships away. French ships are strong at area of effect abilities. The Spanish can warp and teleport both themselves and others around, while the Ottomans can clone and duplicate. There is great potential to stick to theme and come up with something interesting.			"

Got a key to review this. Also, my playtime isn't accurate, the actual playtime is right around half of that. Steam sometimes doesn't register achievements or other things for me either. It's not the game, It's definitely specific to me for some reason.In a world chock-full of complete morons, some smart people make good games..This wasn't put together by a team of idiots, clearly. Although the egg jokes become fairly dry after a level or two, they help set your understanding of the storyline. Other than producing face-palmy reactions to the jokes, they do play a role in letting you know if your character(s) have egg on their face. Now they have me doing it. It's honestly chuckle-worthy to read about Omega III and see your usable material be made out of egg yolk. It's also interesting to see how they worked this into part of the broader setting of FRIGGIN' SPACE. I would never have thought of that. Actually, I don't think anyone would have thought of that other than this dev team- but it's not a bad idea and it's not corny beyond their obvious intent. Beating a joke to death works surprisingly well for this game.Furthermore, the humor plays a large part in the art direction of the game which is, frankly, phenomenal. I can't figure out why someone would make a decision to go quite as wacko-bananas as this team has with art THIS fantastic, but I can only imagine it's the result of a heavy influence from something else that I'm not quite masterful enough at guessing. This could also be an indication that it's not a direct reference to something else as most art and humor has to be these days, but something simply inspired and then splattered all over the place. Seriously, the art direction in this is hilarious, but it is so well defined that the overall talent can't be ignored. Beyond the humor of it - this game is an absolute pleasure to look at, from the drawings to the ship designs, and I do mean from the penned or painted art to the actual computer generated ship designs - it's friggin' good. SoundtrackI like when it sounds, sometimes, like they paid Wendy Carlos to record a bunch of Moog parts, or like they've remixed the Switched on Bach album to a degree of being unrecognizable as Bach compositions. The drums can be a little overpowering. Though I love the synths, I did have to turn the soundtrack off after about a half hour. Don't think I'm not impressed, I just got ear fatigue unusually quickly. GameplayFor the love of God, play the freaking tutorial. It's there for a reason. I have a tendency to skip tutorials because I'm SUPER GAMER WATCH ME PLAY CLICKITYCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKCLICKITYCLICKCLICK - that simply doesn't work for this game, by any stretch of the imagination. When I finally let go of my pride and actually played through the tutorial, I discovered what my problem was. This isn't a game that you can just jump into - but that's not a problem - maybe most people play through entire tutorials and I'm the exception, but I really couldn't enjoy the game until I spent that 15 minutes or so to go through it. I just want to state this one more time: that is COMPLETELY my own stupidity and unwillingness to admit that I don't know everything. Use the tutorial, and you'll be putting several hours into this game soon after. The mechanics are freaking neat. I don't know how I can go into describing this without coming back to the phrase ""Freaking neat,"" either. As I'm not an expert in game mechanics or physics or anything else outside of my career in health care, I can only assume that these guys have an impressive understanding of it and that comes through very well in translation to the game. The flick propellant is neat, but I find that the game's need to control my reaction time to things is a bit annoying. That could just be because I'm spoiled by twitch-reflex gameplay in other games, though. Since I don't write x.x/10 reviews anymore...I'm simply saying that I recommend this game. I am going to scream at you to go buy it right now and support this dev team, particularly because of the art direction and writing present here. These are always a big deal in games, but in this one it begs to be noticed. The gameplay is fun, of course, and there's nothing that this dev team doesn't do well when it comes to their games. However, the art is really where this stands out above its peers in the ""strategy space game"" category. I would rather play this than some Sid Meiers games, and  that's not being flippant.

If you'd like to read our full, in-depth review, you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/conflicks-revolutionary-space-battles-overview-and-review/Conflicks is a very unique game in the space strategy game and not only because it has sentient space chickens. The game utilizes a unique 'Flick' mechanism where you click and draw away from your unit to propell them (or their abiliies) to various locations. It's a very interesting mechanic and a lot of fun to play with.The game is also beautifully detailed with a great art style and the soundtrack isn't too bad either.If you've been looking for something unique in the space strategy genre, this is definitely one to check out, 8.5/10.

Early Access Review
								First of all, i have got to say that the wicked idea of harvesting the power of hens and fighting in space has me hooked from the start. The game has some interesting mechanics that mixed the traditional RTS with the feeling of playing Peggle. The aspect of having to aim your ships and ""flick"" them around, creates a very skillbased fighting system, as well as tactical. The factions in the game are fairly balanced allready, and with further tuning i could see this game getting really good. 8/10 from me, due to the factions feeling a quite out of balance, and the limited around of shortcuts available to control your chicken-armada.

			COMPETITION ENDED! This game is available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/288260 A non-biased quick look @ 'Conflicks - Revolutionary Space Battles' - A refreshing take on 4x4 style space...		

A refreshing take on 4x4 style space strategy games, and don't be put off by the chickens. Conflicks: Revolutionary Space Battles is a creative new take on space-themed videogames that merges the deep, thoughtful gameplay of strategy games with the intuitive accessibility of physics-based games. The game universe is a futuristic alternate history of the European Renaissance that combines elements from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries with science fiction and an oddball sense of humor into a stylized, absurdist world that never takes itself too seriously. Conflicks can be played in a single-player campaign mode where missions are linked together by a story, as well as in competitive battles (against other players or AI). Pledge your allegiance to Greater-Britain, the Celestial Empire, the Sacred Alliance or the Sublime Gate and harvest metamatter in the name of your emperor, or join the Chk’Rathii and lead the Revolution against those poultry-hoarding galactic despots! -  Recommended!

												It looks fun at first, and game mechanics is interesting through the tutorial, but first missions show nothing interesting, the game is very slow: if it was something like MOO with wall vs wall with that mechanics I would totally play it. Metagame is lacking or not existing - or not presented in early game, if so, it's a shame. Bottom line is, this game mechanics does nothing for me and I don't know if there's anyone I could suggest this game to. Too much of innovation in one game? Maybe.			"

												It's simply unplayable by the amount of bugs: every now and then the game crashes.As too much flicking micromanagement takes place with many events running in parallel  it should be changed from RTS to TBS.On the positive side sound, graphic design are great as they are. Though it makes me wonder after completing all the campaigns will it be worth to play the flicking competition at all?			"

												I love the art, setting, and storyline so far. However, the controls are unnecesarily difficult. There are simply too many options and you have to micromanage each ships abilities. -Things like building new ships should not have to require selecting the capitol ship, selecting the ship to build, and then using the flicking mechanic to initiate the build. To many steps for something that can just be attatched to a number key and auto built.-The flicking mechanic is cool, and I like how it moves the ships. However, you can only flick one ship at a time. In order to move a fleet, you have to create a specific ship, activate its tractor beam mechanic, initiate the machanic using a flick, then double click the navigation guide computer so you can see exactly where you will end up, activate the move ability, flick to move the ship which tractors all the fleet with it, then finally deactivate the tractor beam because the other ships can't use abilities with it on. In a RTS one should be able to just select all units and flick them as a group. The tractorbeam mechanic is a very bad idea that convolutes a process of movement which sould be stupid simple and easy to implement and instead makes it difficult to just play and enjoy the game. Instead you spend all the time of the attack micromanaging movement from point a to point b. Just NO! Bad!-I love the planet capturing mechanic, and it's cool that you have to aim the hen ships just right so they don't get caught by the planets gravity.-Mechanics like the corvette's spike ability which gives it extra ramming damage should just be automatic! It just adds another unnecesary step onto the pile of unnecesary steps already.-A lot of these abilites should be automatic. Cloaking should not be a thing you need to activate. It should just deactivate when you enter battle or use an ability. Henships stealing metamatter with the drone ability from other ships should just be an automatic timed event. It should be a penalty for going to close to a henship which is pretty defenseless anyway. The activated torpedo mechanics where definately cool, and the astroid physics were really fun. That is what makes the flicking mechanic so unique and they did a good job at it. However, the flicking mechanic is way overused for too many mundane unnecesary tasks to make up for it, and it feels like these mundane convoluted actions were included to slow the game down so the players couldn't rush too hard, or overwhelm too easilly. However, instead it's really game breaking in that it gets boring way to fast, and worse obnoxiouse. It really ruined the game for me even though I wanted to experience the rest of the cool, if a bit cheesy, storyline. "

												Just like to say that I really love space games, and RTS / 4x style games.  This game has an amusing sense of humor, ships with lots of guns and an interesting mechanic (that does get tiring after a little while).  I suspect this game was designed for mobile devices at first as it would be much better with touch controls.  The real problem with the game however comes from having WAY to much going on at one time, along with the controls requiring far too much time to implement, which takes the fun out of the game.  Panning around the map, looking for a ship that needs orders, and issuing them through the painfully slow interface is just too stressfull.  There is a ""Pause"" system that lets you scroll around and click on ships, which does help some as you can pause while scrolling, but the simple omission of being able to give orders while in pause makes this mode a pale shadow of what it should be.

												This game is surmised in all aspects by this statement:Mediocre concept, wonderful execution.I mean really. Props to the devs to making a funtionally great game out of an awful concept. Everything works, the game is fully written with an intricate story, the core concepts of the game are delivered to what seems the full potential they were imagined. But alas, no matter how much you polish a turd, it is still a turd. The whole concept of an RTS where the core mechanic is flinging flicking whatever angry birds style is awful, no matter how well it works. Same with rewriting european history with egg yolks being an allpowerful substance. That is not funny, no matter how beautifully you illustrate it or how many witty references are thrown in. This game is a mishmash of great concepts into one large poo-flavored concept, which was then created and executed with skill. I say watch some gameplay of this game on youtube, see if the humor or game style is up your alley, then make your decision.			"

												Its a mixed bag to simply put it.  the art style and the unique concept I quite like, definately suits the setting quite well.  The story is nicely written but do not expect a captivating or riveting story for its more there to soak up some hours of your time, although somewhat entertaining nonetheless.Now here are the problems. Having to 'flick' your spaceships makes it so that you have to micromanage quite a bit. Why, just why? I also found that the AI, the majority of the time would send perhaps one or two ships at my army of 10 ships rather than build an army and then proceed to attack mine. This meant I could easily crush them. I believe the maximum I ever saw was 5 ships together and it was the only time they challenged me.  Also why can I not issue orders when paused?  perhaps it was just me but using the 'flick' mechanic meant some ships did not go where I would of liked them to go-the end result being a cluster♥♥♥♥ of errors. If this game was turnbased maybe I would of liked this game...alas I can only dream.It is definately not a bad game by all means its just certain problems spoilt it for me. Shame, real shame.			"

												Gameplay gets pretty tediously micromanage-y, and generally I ended up just building a few ships, tractoring them together with a frigate, and then just flicking the whole cluster at whatever I wanted to die. I'd stick one battleship in the mix and use that to build new ships at the destination as soon as it landed. That strategy is so effective that I basically just got bored and stopped being interested.That said, the constant misogyny in the game got old even faster than the gameplay. I mean, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's so bad I kept wondering if the misogyny might be trying to be a parody of medieval misogynistic attitudes, but it was so annoying either way that it didn't matter to me if it was misogyny or a parody of it. It was just irritating. I still don't get how a game about space chickens ended up being more about medieval attitudes towards women.Look, yes, the gameplay and art style is pretty original, I give the developers that, but I just didn't enjoy playing the game and ended up just deleting it after a couple hours of play time.

								Wanted to like this but the -creative- control mechanic isn't a -good- control mechanic. Flicking the ships around is slow, which would be tactical except they damage each other in real time and the computer is less slow so can sneak several ships up on you while you're trying to maneurve a harvester (sorry ""henship"") all the way across the map to the tiberium (sorry ""planet""). It's like trying to play subbuteo in boxing gloves. Every ship has a special ability - but I found it was pointless using any of them because they are as fiddly as the movement and the time taken to do it would be better spent manually pulling another ship out of the construction yard (sorry ""flagship""), or manually moving another ship another few inches toward whatever it was supposed to be doing. The special abilities are also the only distinguishing difference between the 4 factions, so the movement mechanic ends up limiting even that.If it had been turn-based a lot of the frustration wouldn't have arisen, but I guess they must have discarded that idea for some good reason or other. The humour deserves a mention - but the joke (alternative history with chicken powered space travel) wears thin quickly, and they fill several screens of text with it at the start and finish of each mission.I played about 6 missions and quit after spending an hour on a map only to then flick my mothership through a wormhole that just dumped it onto the side of a planet where it crashed. (Wormholes are random to make everything even more laborious.) I couldn't take any more after that.I'm not angry with it as a purchase or sorry I bought it, it was worth experimenting with. It's clearly been developed in a polished, professional way and they might well tweak and improve it somehow. Maybe it should be touchscreens-only. Maybe it should have a 4x grand strategy layer also controlled by ludicrous flicking. Maybe it would be more fun if you couldn't really tell where the ships were going to land. I don't know. It just isn't for me.			"

												Played the game this free weekend. Wish there were a neutral choice on recommendation.Honestly, I like the plot, I like the visuals and I even liked the gimmick flicking. But...it doesnt work in a RTS game. This would be golden if it was a turn based game. Or if one could assign orders while paused. But real time flicking...it was a bit of a hassle.Other than that, I liked the uniqueness of the ships and loved to torpedo some asteroids in enemys. And the moon thing, yeah, pretty nice and clever.Just....make it not RTS, but turn base game and I will buy it. For now, I removed from my wishlist, sorry.			"

								This game was eggactly what I needed. Omlette you discover for yourself why it's so wonderful tho. Definitely worth crossing the road for. It's a family sized bucket of fun for sure. It's about time we saw an original recipe in gaming.   I will warn you that the difficulty is hard boiled, not over easy at all.  I've played it for hours and barely cracked the shell of what's on offer here.  It really crepes up on you, and you'll be clucking the mouse until dawn.  As an added bonus, you get double yolks for the price of one.  Gift it to someone special and maybe you'll get laid.-- The Colonel.			"
