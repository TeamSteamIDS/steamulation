												Played the original Eufloria from an indie bundle. Liked it enough to buy a couple copies and pass it around.I had totally forgotten about this game, and out comes a surprise free update months later! They're calling it Eufloria HD, but should really call it Eufloria 2. There's so much new and added depth I kind of feel like I'm playing a sequel. New unit types, many UI improvements and a rebalanced campaign. Steam achievements were added and it sure would be nice to see trading cards enabled.What could make this better of course would be multiplayer and a more customizable skirmish. I'd also like to see hotkeys enabled. As it is this is an excellent game and well worth a purchase.			"

												This is an enjoyable game.  I would like to mention the cool sci-fi ideas behind this.  THis game is based on an actual proposed technology called dyson trees. THese would be some sort of replicating technology that could colonize asteroids and bud seeds that could go on to colonize others.  It also is related to a type of space probe called a self replicating Von Neumann machine. So you play as sort of an nanotechnology intelligence embodied in these trees/seed. Pretty cool.The game itself is enjoyable, you can play it at a slow speed for a meditative growing game or crank it up to fast making it a little frenetic. I played the original a while ago. Im not sure what all has been upgraded, but it has better graphics, i think more missions and modes, some extra controls. Get this game.			"

												Eufloria HD is an upgraded version of the original Eufloria, which I also played. Both games are an extremely relaxing and atmospheric strategy based on some gameplay mechanics from simpler flash strategy titles: capture planets (here called asteroids), upgrade them (here with beautiful trees that grow over time) and they will generate units (here called seedlings) over time, then use said units to flood other asteroids. Take over the map and you win. Rinse and repeat.Despite the fact that the games tend to reach a certain tipping point where it becomes easy to overwhelm your enemies, Eufloria is a very polished take on this idea, and a lot of fun to boot! The soundtrack is very mellow, and the visuals are clean and beautiful. This version upgrades the visuals and adds some new mechanics, such as the ability to upgrade asteroids which have poor stats by sacrificing seedlings, and rallying points which means less needless clicking and dragging.There is a solid story mode that can take about 10 hours to complete (or more depending on what speed you play at), as well as arcade levels and a New Game + mode. Overall, a decent amount of content for the price.Honestly, I cannot recommend this game enough! It has a great, calming atmopshere, some straightforward but satisfying RTS gameplay and a solid campaign and arcade mode. Definitely worth the price!			"

												The original was already worth buying. Enjoyed every second completing it. Surprisingly, after almost 2 years passed by, the game still can offer something plus that's worth discovering one more time. Nevertheless there are new functions, abilities, and the game looks better than before.Defo worth trying it if you never heard about it, and defo worth reinstalling and replaying if you already owned it!

Eufloria  Field Rating Review   Graphics 9 Eufloria gets a solid nod for the artistic approach it took to graphics. This game weaves together a beautiful living picture as you play, with pleasant and relaxing aesthetics, from sound to visuals.    Gameplay 7 A wonderfully relaxing game, Eufloria is great to sit down and play when you're looking to just chill out. Mesmerizing in style, with a downtone soundtrack, Eufloria offers up a unique take on strategy games. Taking a much more tug of war approach, you grow your seeds (altering their stats via another artful gameplay mechanic) and work to overwhelm the opposing forces. Eventually it becomes a domino effect as you send wave after gigantic wave of units from planet to planet, toppling over the enemy's forces. However, it can be a bit tedious at times waiting for your army to grow enough to make your next move, particularly at the start of each game. This problem is few and far between though, as several times you are under immediate pressure to act.   Story 3 You probably won't find yourself caring much about the story of this game, as it is strange and vague most the time.   Multiplayer N/A None to be found here.   Replayability 5 Eufloria is one of those games you come to when you need it. For me, that particular time is when I need to wind down and relax. Each time coming back is enjoyable though.   Overall 6/10 Don't get confused by the 6 over there, that's still a good number. I definitely recommend Eufloria to anyone that enjoys sitting down and playing a chill game. If you're looking for fast paced action this game is not for you. Eufloria is a moment of calm in a storm of run-and-gun, spray-and-pray, leap-then-look games.

												Eufloria was already a masterpiece.Eufloria HD is beyond excellent. Its improvements are amazing. Options are added for almost eveything, but not becoming complex.So what can I say... After a break of eight years I started playing videogames again, and in its release Eufloria not only surprised me gladly, but showed me everything was left to be done.Now... well, just you know the developers have given Eufloria HD for free to previous owners, with soundtrack included (which is fantastic!) and they polished and improved what was already excellent.This is one of my favourite games of all times.Speechless.

												Eufloria (and it’s HD upgrade) are strategy games at the core, however I’m not sure what sub genre they fall into. Similar to games like Galcon, the goal is to plant your seed on large planets, allow forces to build up, then swarm the next planet to expand. It feels a lot like the combat within an RTS, but simplified down immensely and without any base building aspects.That being said, it’s not a bad game. I first played it on mobile and I think the simplicity of the format works well with a touch screen,  however when making the switch to PC I found that I felt very idle in the game. With a mouse, keyboard and macros I have infinitely more micromanaging power than when I’m toilet gaming with two thumbs. Because of this, I find that this isn’t a very compelling title to own on PC. Eufloria (and Eufloria HD) are good games and I do recommend you give them a go, but be fully aware that you’re going into a more mobile-minded experience.			"

This game deserves much more attention from the general public and its own developers.			"

												I've played this game WAY too much not to give it a positive review. From old Eufloria to Eufloria HD. (I think I logged over 100 hours in Eufloria before it became HD)The reason? It's a very low brainpower time waster that you can play while listening to podcasts or audiobooks. I'm not meaning that it is a waste of time, just that even after you've played it before and all the mystery is taken out, the gameplay is still fun, even if you aren't actually seeing anything different or improving your skill at the game. Get yourself a good audiobook and play a few rounds.Actually I kinda wish they had made more of those map packs and extra missions.			"

												The HD remix has revived my obsession with this game. For those of you who have played before: The tutorial has been greatly improved, both in pacing and in clarity. The UI is much easier to read at a glance, and much more intuitive to boot. I also greatly appreciate some of the features they've added - beacons, terraforming, etc. It's definitely worthwhile to revisit.If you haven't played before, Eufloria is a unique RTS through and through. It's amazing how this game pairs a relaxing setting with challenging goals.  I get so absorbed I often don't realize how much time has passed. There is a time element, but it's not strict. You can pace yourself however you wish. The game increases in difficulty somewhat slowly, but the hardest levels kept me entertained long after I finished story mode. There's a surprising amount of complexity arising from simple mechanics. The fact of the matter is - I played 50+ hours of the original, and here I am years later, and the mechanics are still feel fresh and challenging. That, my friends, is the mark of a good game.			"

												This game did not get better in any way. If you want a good game, get the original Eufloria!!**NOTE: I have about 57 hours on record for the original game, and i HIGHLY RECOMMEND that version of Eufloria **Key problems with Eufloria HD:- Navigation; they tried to make it easier, but made it actually harder by adding weird buttons and the green pie to limit numbers. For basic functions like sending scouts or all troops you need more clicks than before. You now need for example up to 3 clicks to complete a move, where it used to be just 1 click- Graphics; i did not see much improvement over the original game. The interface is reasonable, but i prefere the more minimalistic interface of the original game. Certainly no difference that validates the buzzword ""HD""- Sound; the soundtrack is not as relaxed as the original game- ""New"" features; hardly worth mentioning (from what i've seen the gameplay is still basically the same with the levels & achievements)			"

												This game isn't bad, exactly, I mean playing it isn't a negative experience.  It's just unengaging.  It's a game made for tablets (pretty obvious from the UI), but it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else, so I can't hold that against it.  Unfortunately what the game does try to be is...not very ambitious.There is absolutely no strategy involved - the solution to every level is ""amass several hundred units and steamroll through the map.""  There is only one unit, and while some have more speed or more strength, none of that matters because overwhelming numbers trumps all in this game. There are 25 levels, and every single one of them plays the same way.The game easy, but intentionally so - it's supposed to be a relaxing game, which it is for the most part, the music and visuals are really well done!  Unfortunately, towards the last couple of levels, the game resorts to cheap methods of increasing difficulty, like having your enemies start the level controlling more units and more territory on the map.  You may end up restarting a level several times, hoping the enemy will decide not to attack you in the first 5 minutes this time and totally wipe you out.And there is so.  Much.  WAITING.  Waiting for your trees to grow.  Waiting for more seedlings to spawn.  Not helped by the fact that everything happens at an incredibly sluggish pace, and even on the fastest time setting, you can still Alt-Tab to your browser once in a while without fear.TL;DR: This is a game that is meant to be played while you do something else.  It's a game meant to waste time.  You'll never wake up one day and get the urge to play some more Eufloria, so I can't really recommend it.  But if you're stuck at your parents' house for Christmas and your $3000 PC is back home and all you have is your dinky laptop, then yeah, Eufloria will distract you for a bit.			"

												An enjoyable, relaxing RTS game with great atmosphere.  Don't be fooled by my playtime, I played the original Eufloria years ago, and it's still in my Steam top-20 with nearly 50 hours played.  Impressive for a small indie game, especially if you consider I don't generally like RTS games.  And now these wonderful developers decided to gift the new improved HD version to everyone who bought the original game.The game isn't complicated at all, the tutorial levels do a great job to teach you all you need to know.  You start with seedlings around an asteroid under your control.  You can move them to other asteroids within your influence sphere, possibly attacking enemy seedlings in the process, or plant them to grow a tree.  Trees produce seedlings, with increasing output overtime when they become fully grown.  Seedlings come with 3 characteristics, based on the quality of the asteroid they were grown on : energy, strength and speed.  Strength and speed are obvious, higher energy means you will need less seedlings to conquer an enemy asteroid.  Some more complexity later on, but those are the basics in a nutshell.What makes this game great is the atmosphere, sound & graphics.   It really looks gorgeous, with a high attention to detail (e.g. seedlings stats also change the way they look).  You notice how the developers really made this with a passion.  The levels are partially procedurally generated, the level will never be identical, but some parameters stay the same.  The music is nice and relaxing.  You also have a lot of control over the speed of the game, allowing for both rushed gameplay or a relaxing experience.If I have to mention something negative, the only thing I can think of is the lack of complexity.  Levels start to feel too similar after awhile, because you are growing seedlings and invading asteroids over and over again.  There is some variation in each level's initial strategy, but usually it's pretty obvious if you have to grow, attack or flee to beat the level. "

												Its like they looked at the original Eufloria and asked, ""What makes this fun to play?"" Then took those elements and changed them to be tedious and more complicated than they need to be.  The interface has been made absurdly large as well like its made for toddlers or your grandparent's failing eyes.  Overall it lacks all the fun and quick gameplay of the original playing more like it was made to purposely complicate things that were intuitive and simple before.   I can't reccomend this version of Eufloria at all...get the original version of Eufloria and you'll have a lot more fun with it.  Playing this version just feels tedious, the fun has been sucked out of it.I have 424 hours playing the original Eufloria but I'm seriously considering uninstalling Eufloria HD as a waste of disc space since I really can't see myself even finishing this version.  Thanks for the free update to the new version....I just wish it was worth playing.Original Eufloria - 8/10Eufloria HD - 3/10			"

Hands off - that shiny planet, that's mine.""It's called HD, but it's not accurate, you can see it like an extension of the game, with much more content and some changes in the general mechanic and behaviour of the AI.I don't know if by purchasing the original version you will get the HD version for free, but you can go ahead and buy it anyway, it's worth it.The game itself is a unique strategy game with ambient soundtrack and an original idea : conquering huge systems of planet with your army of flower-like spaceships.Learn to defend your outpost planets, scout with high-speed breed of seedlings, gather a gigantic swarm of flowers, control the space with mines, enhance your babys by terraforming their native stars, and bring death, doom, destruction, and despair to your ennemies in a raging tempest of lasers at a cosmic scale.

Each node has different strengths for the units that grow there. So you must decide when to defend/attack and when/where to spend your resources. There's 25 story missions that don't vary too much, but usually create tricky start positions that you need to build from.			"

WRITTEN FOR EUFLORIA CLASSICIt seems I can't post a review for that one anymore, so I'll just add it here. Thanks, Gabe.Man, was I tricked by Eufloria or what? I played it briefly, not even maybe half an hour or so in total, couple of years ago and was left with the impression it was an easy game you play more to relax than anything else accompanied by a really mellow tunes to kick back to. Needless to say, my initial formulation was wrong so let's get into just how badly I misjudged the game.At its core Eufloria is what it says on the tin – strategy game where you control Euflorians, race that exists to plant their Dyson trees on various asteroids you come across over 25 story levels game has to offer, and explore the universe in the process. Plot does reveal itself more with time and you realize there are far graver things at stake here, but game never indulges in full-blown narrative or anything like that. Simple text popups at the beginning of each mission and sometimes during will suffice. In my opinion anything more overbearing would suffocate the great mood game has going on no matter what's happening on the screen.When it comes to gameplay things aren't that simple as each asteroid, depending on size, has a “jump range” that effectively limits how far you can travel initially which translates into gradual expansion from your starting position. As far as your Dyson trees go there are two types; seedling-producing and defensive trees which generate mines for self-defense. Yes, you read that correctly and there is, in fact, combat in the game as not all asteroids you come across are actually empty and there are other Euflorians, I suppose, doing their own thing just like you. Once your seedlings approach an already occupied asteroid you will have to fight it out first before you can begin assailing asteroid's core energy and claim it by expending units to build your first tree. If any other trees survive the siege you will also assume control of those so it might be worthwhile to actually take over developed locations and not just build from the ground up. Big determining factor in this is that asteroids have their defining attributes: Speed, Strength and Energy, all of which carry over to seedlings you spawn from that asteroid's Dyson trees. I feel like I'm over-complicating this and game neatly color codes everything for you so there's no problem there, with things like no real resources except your seedling making it even simpler to put together.Where problems start to rear their head is when you realize this isn't just a “select your troops and ATTACK” all the time or at least until you have an overwhelming force to your name. In particular, later on when scenarios get more complex and you need to devise specific situations in order to advance. From simultaneously trading bases with your enemy so he can bait other enemies and distract them for you, to essentially protecting the enigmatic Grey in order to study them game does vary it up a bit even though at its core it's all about conquering mass and building on top of it. I really enjoyed when things like flowers and laser mines got introduced and opened up your pretty basic strategies. There is a weird sensation to be found in throwing hundreds after hundreds of seedling-warriors at the enemy and taking away his asteroids one by one... only to end up dismayed when you lose it all because you recklessly rushed forward and ran into a fully fortified asteroid. Somewhat procedurally generated levels don't help in blindly repeating your mistakes so it's back to school time and actually paying attention to what you're doing.I must say soundtrack by Milieu really adds to the overall package, though. It helps you stay calm and plan your actions coolly even when you're not simply drifting away listening during moments of idleness and nail-biting empire building. When time comes for forces to clash it may seem out of place for such atmospheric electronica to take front stage, but it strangely fits. Nothing but praise and I hope to hear it elsewhere someday.So let's cut to the chase – should you play Eufloria? If you know what you're getting into and don't get bamboozled like me. Through no fault of the game, mind you. I merely formulated my opinion way too early and paid the price. Later levels WILL tax you and it stops being a breeze at half-way point, but I've also heard people say game is too easy and even more challenging Dark Matter mode exists for those people so maybe I'm just not suited for this one.It was certainly an experience.

												A very pretty and relaxing game about trees taking over the galaxy. Yo ushoot your seeds at other planets and kill seeds with a different color. Then you can sacrifice your seeds so your planet can make more pure seeds, which are stronger than the previous generations. It feels a bit racist, killing other colors and taking their planets. but its fun addictive and very relaxing.also this game has flowers that shoot lasers in space			"

												That I thumbs up this game is VERY HESITANTLY. It has both very postives and very negatives. And I feel especially the latter should be a warning.-it's unengaging. I came to the same conclusion as Dubhe14 below: it's all about creating the largest fleet. If you want an RTS to have strategy and depth, this is NOT the game for you.-boring. Even before I came to realise swarming was the one winning strategy, the story couldn't interest me in the least. The abstract style has to do with it, as well as the fact that there is literally nobody to identify with (unless you zoom in incredibly, your fleet consists just of dots)Yet on the plus side, I must say...+original. This is a soothing, calm RTS. I've never encountered this type of RTS before. And while the style isn't engaging, I'm amazed at how time starts to fly by once you're into it.+a time waster. this may sound like a negative, but there is something compelling (though not engaging) in watching the numbers go up and slowly growing into a massive attack force. There isn't much in terms of strategy, but there is some.In the end conclusion...don't buy this game on steam unless you plan to play it on the go. Or get it on a tablet (the game is made for touch controls rather than a mouse). I don't regret getting it...but wouldn't buy it again for my desktop PC. :-)			"

												Excellent, ambient, chilled-out build-and-send colonisation game.  The HD update looks even more gorgeous than the original and includes features that players of the original game requested.The original had no waypoint trees, so the player needed to move seedlings from every planet, every time.  This version has addressed that issue and several others.Lovely game.  The rules are simple, but there's enough depth of strategy for it to be challenging - especially if you play the dark matter levels.  Graphically minimal but really beautiful.  Fans of games like Osmos and probably many tower defence fans will enjoy this game (although it isn't really tower defence).			"

												In comparison to the old one:Good:-New cool, interesting features, like upgrading asteroids with certain unique upgrade trees, which don't use a tree-slot.-new shiny graphics-AFAIK it's a free upgrade for people who owned the old oneBad:-I don't know if the old one has this as well, but you can't choose a resolution when you are in window mode. You can manually resize the window, but you alwas have to redo it when you start the game.-The UI is made for console and is horribly annoying and unintuitive when you play with mouse. You need so many unnecessary clicks. Misclicks are way too common or you have to be very cautious all the time. It destroys the fun of the otherwise really good game, Usability with mouse overall is just bad.I won't recommend this game. People expect at least an equally well experience in all areas and not such a downgrade in terms of controls.			"

												Eufloria HD is a zen-out RTS. You play as Freeman Dyson.I would say that the game is an embodiment of good simpleness, in many ways. Regarding the gameplay, it isn't unchallenging, but it is straightforward RTS in design; you've got your scouting, expanding, conflict, and some asset improvement—it doesn't try to overcomplicate itself. Its visuals are also quite simple, using a minimalistic style, which evokes images of insects and plants. It has chill electronic ambient music playing throughout play, never trying to do anything too complicated with its sound, and meshing quite well with the game's all around simplicity. It doesn't try to reinvent the Stanford torus, it's just a good simple game.Improvements made in Eufloria HD over Eufloria look like they have either a console or a mobile version responsible for their existence. This isn't a bad thing. While the UI isn't as purely minimalistic as was in the original, it's far more functional, allowing the player much more manual control over their harvests of seedlings; an example would be splitting a large swarm of seedlings, one half to intercept attackers of one of your undefended asteroids, while sending the other half to punish the attackers for leaving their own asteroid open. In the original, your options were to send all, or if you wanted to split forces, you were required exactly as many right-clicks as units you intended to send, or right-hold, and get a number kind of close to what you wanted; neither of which were quick. There are also now options to filter what you want to send where by traits, without delving into 100% micromanagement. In addition to the improved control over large swarms, due to the addition of beacons to direct where newly spawned seedlings go, building those large swarms is now much easier. Altogether, I feel that these are substantial improvements to the flow of gameplay, removing a large amount of frustration and tedium that wore the zen thin.While I loved the originals, both Dyson and Eufloria, for what they were, Eufloria HD has finally resolved its prior versions' major gameplay flaws, which worked counter to the chill environment its developers envisioned. With that in mind, I can now give the game my wholehearted recommendation for anyone looking for a nice little RTS to relax with. Even if you find its full price a bit of an ask, there are much worse things you could put in your cart during a sale.I should note, that due to the simple monochrome backgrounds with bright neon seedlings, the game lends itself quite well to the Tetris effect.

												The original Eufloria was much better than the HD one.  Enfloria HD is too stylized and overly complicated for PC users- the original was much more user friendly and simple.  The fast forward option ruins the slow, peaceful pace of the game.  Definitely do NOT recommend the HD version.  Just get the original and don't even look at this one.  And if you think Eufloria HD was difficult, the original Eufloria is going to be MUCH more so just because it doesn't have the extra functions that makes HD pretty easy.			"

												I don't see what people find so great in this game. Don't get me wrong, it is far from a bad game; the gameplay is decent and the art has a good initial concept.But in terms of production values, it falls short; some blurred graphics that shouldn't be (I speak about the HUD, not about what's blurred on purpose like the seedlings), badly designed sprites (there I also speak about what's blurred on purpose) although there is not much visual content, uninspired font and implementation... Overall it looks lacking some art skills (besides the original concept), or quickly done. All this would be totally acceptable if these amateurish-not-always-crisp-neither-numerous visuals didn't weigh more than 2 Gigs on the hard drive! Sure I haven't played much, but I really can't fathom where in the game they have put these heavy bitmaps...Anyway, in terms of game experience, I'm not hooked and feel bored – a relative failure IMHO, since I usually like both atmospheric games, slow paces, and indie games.

												This game is not value for money. I absolutely love this game, I can get lost in it, but would i have bought it if i knew there was no additional content from the developer... heck no.It feels like, design a game, make as much $$$ as possible and dont bother adding any other stages or content. You can finish this game in a few hours and then thats that, so if you feel like burning some cash, then yes, but without additional maps and content, there is only ""so much"" you can do in it and then it becomes really boring really fast. I loaded it onto my machine again hoping new content was available in an update or anything, but instead the additional content provided is original Eufloria soundtracks? if i wanted tunes ill go to a nightclub, not steam.Final: without the developers interest in creating new content and growing the map base of this game, you are better off with a rival title that is content rich with more maps etc... hope my next choice has more content than Eufloria HD.It had so much potential "

												Stop upholding “fun” as the universal, ultimate criterion for a game’s relevance. It’s a meaningless ideal at best and a poisonous priority at worst. Fun is a neurological trick. Plenty of categorically unhealthy things are “fun”. Let’s try for something more. Many of the alternatives will have similarly fuzzy definitions, but let’s aspire to qualities like “edifying”, “healing”, “pro-social”, or even “enlightening”. I encourage you to decide upon your own alternatives to “fun” in games (while avoiding terms like “cool” and “awesome” and any other word that simply caters to existing, unexamined biases).			"

												I absolutely love Eufloria HD. I think the controls are far more intuitive than the original game, Eufloria. The only flaw is that I wish there was.. more to it? Once you beat the game once there's not much to do except perfect your times. Once you've gotten most of the achievements though, there's not much to do but delete your progress and start over. And as with many things, I wish there were multiplayer options. But still an overall great, challenging game with excellent replay value.			"

												I've spent well over 100 hours playing this on console back in the day. I'm a little rusty at it now, but I have to say that this is one of, if not THE best, strategy game I've ever played. It's not particularly complex; you are in control of seedlings looking to colonise asteroids in some distant future. You use seedlings to fight enemy seedlings, scout out out unknown asteroids and grow trees that allow you to populate your seedling army, or protect your own asteroid. Each asteroid has 3 traits that determine what attributes your seedlings will have when they grow; energy, strength, and speed.That's essentially it, but with these basics rules the game becomes heart pounding. The first few sections are basic tutorials, but after a couple of hours you are waging wars against hundreds and hundreds of enemies, wars of attrition and patience. Holding key asteroids on the front lines, and managing which asteroids will become seedling producers and for what traits, becomes crucial in large battles. I've had games last for hours because of the attrition warfare, and because of how relaxed the game is. Timing is also key; do you rush an enemy asteroid in an instant to secure a quick victory, all the while leaving another asteroid unguarded? Or do you slowly build your force, moving from asteroid to asteroid, claiming each for your own in a slow but secure campaign?The art style is a huge draw for this game. It's something I can't quite describe. With simplistic but vibrant colours, and a beautiful soundtrack by Milieu, the game lies somewhere between a surreal nature documentary and some kind of 1970's late-night cartoon fever-dream. I spent many gloomy days being absorbed into a kind of trance because of the visuals and sounds. Overall I'd very much recommend this title if you are even a passing fan of RTS or somewhat relaxing games. One thing I will say is that I personally prefer using a controller for this, but it's equally as playable with a mouse			"

												[Basing my main impressions of the basic game from the original Eufloria, which sadly does not seem available any more on Steam, but these mechanics are essentially exactly the same as in this version, so I feel this small review is still accurate.] In short, this is my absolute favourite Steam game hands-down, and a PERFECT example of how the somewhat emerging ""ambient gaming"" genre should be done.  Gameplay mechanics are simple, yet the gameplay itself can be very challenging.  It's beautiful, it's either slow or fast paced depending on your modd, the music and sounds are just the right amount and volumes...  For a relaxing, simple RTS experience, there is no other game I can think of I'd rather play.While I personally prefer the ""thinner"" aesthetic of the original Eufloria, a couple of hte new mechanics in Eufloria HD make it far less of a pain at times to send various commands and deal with overall gameplay.  So again, this is an absolute gem, a flawless diamond, of gaming amongst so many mediocre titles.			"

												This is pretty much the same as the original 'Classic' version, but with a few tweaks, such as better options (e.g. speed up the game), linux support (!), and slightly less resource hungry (in my time playing this on slower computers).It's very pretty, and you can zoom in to watch as your trees grow, and it is simply mesmerizing. The ambient music is decent, and certainly fits in with what you do, but I'm not sure I can find myself listening to this outside the atmosphere of the game.The gameplay is not bad, but nothing to shout about.Overall, a very pleasing game, at times relaxing, at times stressful (playing the same level over and over), and weird to be making seeds of colour than you chose fight each other. I wouldn't say it's very replayable, but I've played this game on different platforms at least 4 times since it was originally released as Eufloria Classic, so it's got some :P and I definitely recommend having a go.

												This game came out several years ago and recently got a HD upgrade. Unlike most games, anyone who owned the original got the HD version for free. That’s always appreciated. It’s a semi-relaxing puzzle/RTS game where you have various planet-like structures, surrounded by your seedlings. These seedlings can move to different planets and turn into trees, which are used to make more seedlings or to work as defences. The idea of most levels is to have as many seedlings as possible and attack other planets to take over the sector. It is constantly introducing new game mechanics, so it’s always interesting. The levels sometimes have different objectives (get to here, protect this planet, rescue these seedlings, etc) to provide variety. It’s also pretty awesome for playing whilst watching something (TV, YouTube, etc). Alternatively, if you just want to play the game, you can increase the speed.			"

												A 3X strategy game sporting a minimalistic art direction is given fresh life in Eufloria HD. Eschewing complex space combat, which is the dominating genre for the 4X game, in Eufloria you take on the guise of a organic army that has set out to plant itself around the game space. Eufloria sports a couple of ""super units"" each with their own special abilities, two types of ""base structures"" and a simple upgrade system which adds depth to an deceptively complex strategy game. Not many hours of first-play-through time, but at its standard low price its quite enjoyable. Once you have defeated the campaign it garners replayability through ""arena"" modes and a second play through of the campaign at higher difficulty, entitled ""Dark Mode."" I recommend this.			"

												Long story short: I love itI've clocked in... too many hours playing this game in it's original form. I enjoy this sort of game though I'm sure it's not for everyone - try the demo first if you're concerned. The updated HD version is a little bit different in the mechanics but I've already gotten used to it and I think it's for the best. My work requires that I be rather creative and that can be a big mental drain sometimes. This game has been a great way for me to wind down after a long day. There's still plenty of thinking involved but the ambient sounds/music makes a relaxing atmostphere even when my minions are getting slaughtered. I also appreciate the fact that the game doesn't really force me to be something I'm not - there are some levels where speed or sneakiness wins the day but typically, you play the strategy you like best and as long as you play well, you'll win. The storyline is fairly simple, just enough to carry you from mission to mission, teaching you different strategies. I kind of wish more games taught this way in their campaign modes. Maybe to some it seems like hand-holding, though. Regardless, I appreciate not having to think so hard in a game while still feeling engaged.The downsides: not much. It is what it is - an 'ambient strategy game'. Sometimes the really big missions get a bit boring when you have to wait for enough seedlings to accumulate in order to make a key move. The new speed change option in the HD version pretty much fixes that issue for me, however. But still no co-op. I think they're could be great potential there... maybe in Eufloria 2 or something?

												A really simple and relaxing RTS, and a good update of the original Eufloria overall. A few of the interface actions could have been made a little easier (setting beacons is a bit tedious), and one of the levels 18 (Hide and Seek) seems to simply require pure luck in order to make it, but for the most part this was a fun way to kill time while listening to podcasts and the like, and a great study in gorgeous visual minimalism in video game art.

												TL;DR: A lot smoother and better than the previous PC version, but now it's a handheld port.So this is a remix of the original Eufloria which came out some time ago. It was ported over to android and ios, and then then better version was ported back to PC. This version is definitely better than the original on the PC, the fps is better, the sounds are better, there's more music, there's better colours, there's a fast forward button with two settings, there's terraforming so you can make any meteor really good, there's a few other cool new things also. The bad things are that because it's a port from a handheld device, it does assume you mean to do things sometimes when you don't. When you want to select a certain number of seedlings to go to a meteor, it will only let you send a minimum of 10% because on handheld that would be as big as your fingertip is, but on pc I have a mouse cursor so I should be able to get more accuracy! I think on this version of the game the developer added the achievement to beat the entire game in under 10 hours, which is a cool neat small addition, which works well with the fast forward keys. Also it seems the resolution of the game is stuck in 640x480 - I don't think it looks bad, and on fullscreen mode it does indeed fill my screen, just odd I guess.			"

												This is pretty much the same as the original 'Classic' version, but with a few tweaks, such as better options (e.g. speed up the game), linux support (!), and slightly less resource hungry (in my time playing this on slower computers).It's very pretty, and you can zoom in to watch as your trees grow, and it is simply mesmerizing. The ambient music is decent, and certainly fits in with what you do, but I'm not sure I can find myself listening to this outside the atmosphere of the game.The gameplay is not bad, but nothing to shout about.Overall, a very pleasing game, at times relaxing, at times stressful (playing the same level over and over), and weird to be making seeds of colour than you chose fight each other. I wouldn't say it's very replayable, but I've played this game on different platforms at least 4 times since it was originally released as Eufloria Classic, so it's got some :P and I definitely recommend having a go.

												I played Eufloria classic when it first came out. Being a geek, I was already fascinated by the Dyson theory and Eufloria turned out to be a relaxing yet extremely complex and challenging game. So much have I loved it, that after playing on an XP computer (initially) I got it for each new Windows I got, and also for my mobile, and on the tablet of a friend so I could play (which in turn got said friend hooked on it that he beat it as soon as he could). I never tire of playing it. And even though the levels are the ""same"" there's always something slightly different that makes it replayable and of great value.			"

												What makes this game a favorite of mine is its chill and comfortable atmosphere. You can just get lost in managing your seedlings, also thanks to the nice ambient music.Game-wise, the idea is interesting, The controls are intuitive at first, but can get messy as the the amount of planets, seedling-types and other items grows. Some advanced key-shortcuts would maybe have been a good idea, but then again I guess the game is also meant to be played with simple controls (I played more of it on my android phone than on the pc)The balancing is so-so. I feel that some levels can only get won by taking huge risks (rushing), and imo there are levels where you can get into a deadlock, as neither you nor the enemy can win anymore, it just becomes a continous cycle of you going all out taking the planet(s), the enemy recovering, him going all out, repeat ..

												This game is pure strategic bliss, with ambient sound and pleasing visuals. I've completed it several times on PC and Android, and my only nitpicks are selection handling could be tweaked slightly and performance on older android devices could be much better.			"

												Get the original Eufloria instead as it's more or less the same game, but is much better designed in terms of presenting the information you need. In the zoomed out view in Eufloria  HD you can't tell which asteroids have new and planted flowers, or how many seedlings they have.Some interesting new mechanics were added, but they don't make up for how tedious playing the HD version has become.(The orignal Eufloria is probably my favourite casual game ever and I have more than 500 hours in it)Well, the original Eufloria is no longer in the store, so you're stuck with this one.

												One of the best games I have ever played! The mix of relaxing and challenging elements is awesome. Usually I play this game just to chill and relax, but sometimes the levels are a bit tough (especially ""hide and seek"") so it ends in ""just one more try"" :D. Also the music is really beautiful!

												I absolutely love Eufloria HD. I think the controls are far more intuitive than the original game, Eufloria. The only flaw is that I wish there was.. more to it? Once you beat the game once there's not much to do except perfect your times. Once you've gotten most of the achievements though, there's not much to do but delete your progress and start over. And as with many things, I wish there were multiplayer options. But still an overall great, challenging game with excellent replay value.			"

												I've put a lot of hours into this game, ever since it was a free game called Dyson.It's a super chill RTS. A genre I'm usually not into at all. I like to play it with a cup of coffee or two in the morning. If that sounds like something you're into, go for it.It should be noted that the later stages go on for around an hour(you can do a tempsave) but it's kind of frustrating to loose a stage that goes on for a really long time.

												Very few games manage to be both intense and relaxing at the same time. This is one.Beautiful art style, interesting but not complex mechanics, a simple but mildly evocative story, this is all round a good and stylish little game. Some challenging levels but it rarely feels unfair, you really need the right blend of puzzling and strategy in this kind of game and I think Eufloria gets it pretty bang on. Overall, well worth a play through and despite me barely touching the dark matter mode (story mode missions dialled up on the challenge scale) I got over 25 hours of play time so it's surprisingly fulsome.
