												This game is very entertaining and relaxing, with outstanding graphics and soundtrack. While gameplay is simple enough and easy to learn, it still provides an enjoyable experience.The only improvement for me is the difficulty; even in ""Insane"" mode, I beat all levels with more than half time left.Great game to have for bejeweled game lovers and achievement hunters.(100% achievement within 7 hours)7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover[7.5/10]			"

												I have a new found love / respect for Mumbo Jumbo in general. After playing this game and a few others from an Indie Royale bundle I'd say these games are definitely worth it. There's a couple of 7 Wonders games but this particular one is a lot better looking visually than the others and there are a lot of minigames in between the main 'match 3' puzzle style. I'd even go so far to say that this game rivals Bejeweled and other games of this type. With varying difficulty levels and achievements this is definitely a game you can pick up an hour or two and play.			"

												What an oddly adictive game.I turned this on just wanting to check it out as i'd never played it before. Since then an hour of my life has passed.If you like games such as Bejewelled, Yosumin or Candy Crush Saga (Match-them-up puzzles) then this is 100% a game for you to try.The animation is fun and fairly easy on the eye, the game play is really addictive and it does exactly what you'd expect from a game of this type.Also, the combination of minigames within the campaign-style bit of the game stop it from being boring or overly grind-y.My only small bugbear is the colours of the tiles are a little similiar so the longer you seem to play, the more everything seems to merge so it's probably a game you'll take frequent rests from, but I will still be playing this again.

												Match 3 or more in a row, matching 4 or more gives a bonus token that will clear rows or random tiles. The object of the game is to clear the background of the board, when you done that a special tile appears and you have to get that to the bottom of the board. As you progress through the game you unlock different mini-games along the main puzzles, you build a town and decorate it. There is a Zen, Normal, Advanced and Insane difficulty setting. The graphics are nice and the music is relaxing. It's a nice casual game.			"

												Good time killer. Adds a lot of interesting content to the block matching game genre. Graphics are a little dated but since it is very cartooneque you don't notice after a little while. Gameplay iteself is solid with lots of mini-games to try out. Takes a few hours to completely beat. If you want you can play more to get coins to buy more stuff.			"

TL;DRA relaxing, Bejeweled style game where you match blocks together, complete with pretty explosions and sound effects such as WHOOSH and BAAAM and dup dup, so your workers can build you cool things.  ProsGood musicDistinctive GraphicsRelaxingConsGrinding Gameplay First off, this is a pretty casual game to play. The background music is relaxing, and the individual sound effects as you match your blocks or explode them are strangely satisfying, so I find myself getting quite absorbed into this as something easy and not too stressful to try out for chunks at a time. If you've had a stressful day, this can help you to unwind. It has varying puzzles on top of the match three or more main one just to keep you that little bit more interested, and extra power ups that do cool things. You complete a “normal” game by clearing the background tiles, which creates a cornerstone which you need to drop to the bottom of the screen. You can collect “blueprints” and bonuses along the way. You progress with your successes by constructing wonders and buildings to colonise your planet, along with some decorations. Because why not. You get different difficulty settings which you can adjust to your play-style. Great if you want more or less of a challenge.The graphics in the background are nice and not sore to your eye as the colours are muted but still catching. The only con really, (though for some it's not,) is that you'll need to do a fair amount of grinding to complete it. That's where most of the hours goes into, so it would be better as something to do every now and then. Want moar? Click here to join my steam group and Click here to follow my curator page! "

Posted: January 21, 2016
												Quick summary: if you play casually in the easiest mode and do not care for achievement hunting, this is a FUN little game. Otherwise, be prepared to spend an awful LOT of time redoing some of those long levels!These days I've been playing a lot of little match-3 games because they're quick to play and this prevents me from having to choose what 'big' game I'll be playing next, ah ah. I spent 200+ hours on Witcher 3 on GOG, so I come to Steam for shorter game sessions, out of habit. I'm giving this one a negative recommendation but a positive review, because if you're like me you tend to read negative reviews mostly and prefer to see well weighed opinions that will focus on the negative issues but still encourage you to try out the game if they don't bother you.Out of everything I've played these last few weeks (Heroes of Hellen, Bejeweled, Montezuma, Luxor and a couple others), this is on par with Hellen in terms of complexity (although not as interesting), and much worse when it comes to readability. I think this is very important in a game, and if I fail some boards because some of the rules weren't properly explained, or because the rich graphics hurt your eyes (for instance, good luck trying to determine if that special tile needs brown, red or orange matches!), I tend to be unhappy and give up. The problem is that it gets excruciatingly long to finish a single board after the first few tutorialesque wonders. Indeed, after a while your levels will consist of 5 things you'll have to do and be careful about (1) destroy all tiles behind the gems by having them in a match, (2) destroy metal tiles twice, (3) collect up to 5 different resources from special gems (which will take the most effort to do, and don't even try to forget a single one if you don't want to waste more time!), (4) be careful with the board layout, as it often gets convoluted and forces you to use destructive powers in a few places, and (4) do a specific color match on two specific tiles (later in the game, the 'singled out' power-up will help you with those, but by the time you get it, you probably won't need it anymore.) And finally, (5), after you clear a board's tiles, a special gem drops that you must guide to the bottom of the board to finish it. At that point it's time to make sure you gathered all resources, and then use the Column power-up that will save you a lot of time.I've just finished the main game after about 10 hours, and I'd estimate the latter half of the game has levels that would take more than 10 minutes to finish without power-ups, and you never have that time if you're playing in normal mode, so you'll have to use power-ups on a regular basis (thankfully, some of them like the slime monster recharge very quickly). I made a break of a few weeks between my first and second session, and totally forgot the game had power-ups, so... just don't, really, or your self-esteem will suffer. Early levels can be completed without them, but the latter half will systematically give you a shorter time than needed, and you'll have to rely on some of them regularly.I need to mention achievements. Many Steam users enjoy trying to perfect their game, and this one isn't going to be easy. You can easily get two thirds of the achievements by the time you finish the game casually, but some of them are a bit unfair. For instance, there's an achievement you can only get when you finish it in normal mode *and* do not fail a single board. If you do fail one (and it will happen if you don't use power-ups regularly and watch their recharge status), you need to restart the current wonder from the start to ensure you get the achievement. Given that there are a minimum of 7 boards to complete before you can finish building a wonder, it means failing a board might actually force you to spend the next hour or two redoing what you previously completed successfully. This is a game that is best played in Zen mode, I imagine, and let's consider 'Normal' mode to be targeted to hardcore casuals; yes that category exists, that is, regular gamers who haven't come out of the casual closet yet. Ask your aunt what she does at night on the computer, she can give you advice.There are also a few mini-games, some of which are fun (I like the lab one and the map parts one), but they're tied to achievements that require you to finish them all. Completing levels in 'Diamond Domino Mine' is very luck-based (you depend on a draw of items, and you have a limited number of redraws), and if you make a wrong move, there's no 'undo' button, you have to restart the level from scratch. Since that game itself isn't particularly exciting, after a while you just give up on it and the idea of perfecting your game achievements.Other aspects of the game are pleasing, but I think the other reviews mention it enough. I would like to mention the spelling, though. I'm not an English native so I'd be the last person to be a grammar Nazi, and yes I'm aware that this was developed in Russia, and yes story is just a pretext, but there are typos here and there, and if they didn't caught by the US producers, then what can I say... Shows some lack of quality control.			"

												Fun match-3 game with some interesting power-ups and a small progressive story centered around constructing Wonders that's very reminiscent of the palace building from Civilization III. Achievements are all pretty straightforward and apart from a couple of grindy ones (which you will probably get with normal gameplay anyway) they're pretty easy to get.Not a lot of replayability unless you're really fond of match-3, but a nice, easy game to play through.

												This is a match-3 game with lots of fun extra twists included to add on to the fun. There are several different kinds of mini-games included within the game, and added elements to contribute to the complexity and replayability of the game. Basically, if you would like to play a match-3 game with more to it and multiple levels of difficulty, then this is a good choice. Basically, you are building a village, as well as constructing a series of wonders, using supplies you collect during your game as well as buildings that you earn while you play. It also has the nice feature of letting you play as you choose, so that you can go for a perfect score and/or all achievements if you like, or simply play casually for the sake of having laid-back fun.

												The main part of this game is basically Candy Crush with a new coat of paint. Match-three with non-square boards and special square-clearing goals. This is not a bad thing. Candy Crush is a good game. It's fun and interesting. Nothing wrong with using those ideas in a new game.The problem is, Mumbo Jumbo just couldn't let it be fun on its own. Instead of letting the gameplay stand on its own, a good, quality casual game like most of their others are, they completely overdid the extra stuff on this one. There are several minigames (not optional) with totally different gameplay than the game you want to play when you open 7 Wonders. Each of them might be good on their own, but they're not what I want to play right now. They literally interrupt gameplay right in the middle of a level and force you to play a different game.And then they skinner-boxed it into oblivion. It's not enough to give you a level and challenge you to beat it. You also have to gather resources during play to complete the Wonders you are trying to build. Missed one of the special blocks? Then your level of ACHIEVEMENT will be lower. You have to collect ALL THE THINGS, and try to complete each wonder in the minimum number of levels. If you mess one up, there's no going back and trying again until you've completed the entire wonder.In addition to collecting materials, you also have to meet other goals to get the maximum star rating for each wonder. No timeouts, get all the special boxes, etc. On top of that, you have to earn special buildings to put in your little village. AND you have to unlock all the achievements. AND you have to earn all the gold coins to buy all the decorations. AND on top of all of this, there are Steam achievements.It's just ridiculous. The gameplay itself could be fun, but I found myself feeling like I *had* to beat X levels, I *had* to finish building this wonder, I *had* to unlock all the visual upgrades. This is no accident. It's using skinner box techniques, which is dispicable and a sign of poor and lazy design, and it's frustrating because even though I was aware of how they were tricking me into continuing to play, I still couldn't bring myself to delete the game until I had beaten it. When it was finally done, I wasn't proud, happy, excited... I was just relieved that it was finally over. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that sort of experience to anyone.In general, I have found Mumjo Jumbo's casual games to be enjoyable and high quality, but this one is a BIG exception. I shouldn't have to feel like I can't stop playing when I'm ready to stop. I shouldn't feel like I have to continue just because of the psychological addictiveness of earning achievements and other shiny, but useless, things. Mumjo Jumbo should be ashamed of themselves for ruining what could have been a great game with this crap, and I hope they don't try this again, or they will lose a loyal customer.			"

												7 wonders is an inoffensive take on the tile swapping genre. While it adds just about enough to the formula to justify its existence, it doesn’t quite have the polish of Bejewelled 3 or Puzzle Quest. There are a few minor missteps with the design such as blocks which can’t be moved or used in combos, but the game is presented well and you can happily fill a few spare minutes with it. The meta-game with its obligatory coin collection to build structures is largely pointless other than some under developed mini-games.  "

												I loved 7 Wonders previously and I must say that this new opus is quite good and more challenging than the others. And the little guys are still that funny.In other words, you still have to build magnificient sites, apart that here, you're kinda helped by aliens. Your goal is to destruct tiles by making a chain of 3 or more of the same shapes (the colors are helping you to distinguish them) and then to make a big cube fall down. Some tiles are special: the green ones help you to gather trees, flowers or grass, the light blues one to collect water, etc etc... They're important if you want to build the wonder under a specific number of levels and to gain more.Each chain of more than 3 is bringing you bonuses, like eliminating a line, etc.. It can help to reach tiles that can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to destroy for example.Also, you can bonus like a bomb or a swap tiles, etc... that can be used during the level, though you have to resplenish these powers by making chains.In that opus, you can also build your own little village thanks to unlocked buildings.7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover is a nice match-3 game. Don't hesitate.			"

												this is the third '7 wonders' game i have played and it's the best of them so far. certainly one of the best casual games or even _the_ best i have ever played.it's way more polished than the  good but dated '7 wonders II' and way better and more entertaining than the horribly boring and tedious '7 wonders - the treasures of 7'.the graphics are very neat indeed and the gameplay is very relaxing. just like a casual game should be.while the village building is more of a side note and the minigames aren't that hard they offer a nice and very welcome change to the usual block pushing of the main game.you can play the game at your own pace. anything from no time limit at all up to a really tough limit can be selected for each chapter.it took me 10 hours to complete the game and to get all the achievements. if you don't care about achievements and getting the highest rating per level you can do it in 5 to 6 hours if you are quick pusher. but there is really no need to rush through such a cute game.very enjoyable and highly recommended!

												I don't honestly think there's much to say about this title. It's a match 3 with a theme and a handful of gimmicks (candy-crushesque in some ways) and some other side minigames that add a little variety. In other words, it's the natural extension of Bejeweled. It's casual as hell and doesn't pretend to be otherwise. Mumbo Jumbo was probably second on the totem pole when it comes to polished casual titles (the first USED to be Popcap until EA sacrificed them to the gods of commerce) so it's well made and pleasant enough in its presentation.I don't dislike it, and honestly it's the perfect kind of game for me to play when I'm trying to wake up in the morning before work, or when I'm winding down before bed and listening to music or whatever. It's nothing special, but I wouldn't be surprised if I played it to completion over the next few months or so during those hazy pre-work morning hours. Wouldn't be the first time I've done that with a game like this. I guess my one gripe about it is that I was expecting to at least put some makeup on some flamboyant aliens or something with a title like that, but there's no such activity to be found.			"

												Just beat the game. Fun casual times to be had. It's like most every other match-3 game.  The twist is the background behind the gems you match gets removed and falls to the bottom of the screen where little people below use it as raw materials for building wonders.  I believe I got it when it was on sale. The graphics are quite a step up from the older 7 Wonders game I played. In the hub world it appears as if there are many things to do as far as buying and arranging buildings. Unfortunately all but two or three of them are just decorations.

												7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover is a match-three puzzle game, similar to Bejeweled. I've never been a fan of Bejeweled...I've always found the game to be boring, but this game adds a bunch of elements to the formula, and for me, this game succeeds where Bejeweled fails; in providing clear goals as you play. This apparently is the fifth game in the series, but it's the first I've played.As you play, you have several goals you have to keep in mind. You need to make a match of a certain colour of the colored cells, you may have to get as many resources as possible by making matches with the resources tiles and you have to breakaway the background and make a piece fall to the bottom to complete the level. It was much easier for me to stay engaged with this game as I tried to fulfill every goal on the level.There's sort of a meta-game where you use the puzzles to build things, but it doesn't do much for me. The story is incredibly stupid, but it's un-intrusive. This is definitely a game build for touch screens, and the keyboard and mouse controls suffer for it. but the only reason you get a game like this is for the puzzles, and I found them fun. The game's tutorial is completely rubbish, unfortunately, and it almost prevented me from playing at all. You must read all the help screens to play.I'd pick this game up if you see it cheap. There's no shortage of good casual games, and if you enjoy match-three games, I'd recommend this one.			"

I really think companies like MumboJumbo and PopCap would have a hard time making a bad game. It's been awhile since I've played this, but I think the Strategy tag on it is a little bit of a stretch. I wouldn't say there's much strategy involved at all, certainly a lot of logic and matching puzzles, and certainly a great casual game - but strategy? Maybe my problem with that tag is that I feel it shouldn't be thrown onto anything and everything that isn't an RPG, shooter, action, or sandbox game. But I digress, if you're looking for your typical puzzler with some fun music and gameplay, that can be mildly addicting for a few hours and it's easy enough to help you relax - you can't go wrong with this one. I noticed that one of the other games under the franchise carries a Beatles album reference, as well, which makes the title of the series instantly become a reference to a Beatles lyric, as well. Cute, and clever. Certainly fun, but I don't see any reason to have more than one game like this, because they're almost bound to be the exact same game over and over in a different historical context or with some light silliness thrown in. I'm tempted to say look at the various games in the series, pick one, purchase it, and call it a day - lets face it, if you've played one game like this, you've pretty much played them all. new technology and graphics can only go so far with this type of game because they've got their shtick down pretty tight. By no means is any of that an insult. I'm almost positive I picked this up when it was on a sale or featured in a bundle of some sort, and I would probably purchase it on its own merrit if it was around half the normal asking price. If you're into games like this, a worthy buy. If you're not, then you're not reading this review, anyway. Not stellar, but not shabby either. Average, but a fun diversion for a few hours. Thanks, Mumbo. 6.5/10 - Bumped from 6.0 because they made a Beatles reference and I friggin' love the Beatles. <3			"

												This game has had me hooked lately, so let's analyze why with a review!In MumboJumbo’s fifth installment in the 7 Wonders franchise, 7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover, we continue to see some of the most highly polished match-three play this side of Bejeweled, with an interesting Wonder/city-building mechanic thrown in for depth. The 7 Wonders series has never been known for complex storylines and extraordinary gameplay variety, but this series continues to be one that’s easy to start playing, yet incredibly hard to put down.The storyline in 7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover sees humans and aliens working together for the betterment of both species. Humans are providing aliens with gemstones and minerals to power their devices, while the aliens teach humans about their advanced sciences. This is a pretty peachy setup, but the story isn’t really referenced again throughout your 3-4 hours of possible play here. Instead, you’ll be thrown into the process of building a variety of Wonders all around the globe, from South America to Europe, via a fairly standard, but also incredibly fun match-three gameplay setup.Each level asks you to make matches of three or more similar symbols either vertically or horizontally in order to clear the tiles underneath. Once all of the level’s tiles have been removed, a cornerstone will appear on the board that must reach the bottom (by clearing the symbols underneath it) to actually complete the level. Depending on your choice of difficulty, your progress could be timed, but the average player should have no real challenge in finishing each level on Normal. This is especially true when taking into account the game’s many power-ups, which can appear both automatically and manually.The most common power-ups are earned by making matches of four or five symbols at once, and they see you eliminating an entire row or column of gems from the board with a single click. Other power-ups may see you eliminating just a single tile that’s causing trouble, throwing an x symbol on the board to clear a selection of tiles and so on. You’ll be able to choose which power-ups to use by simply activating them from a menu on the left-hand side of the screen, but depending on the size of your computer monitor, these can be placed a bit too far away from the action.As you complete stages, you’ll earn building blocks, gold bricks and more, which can be used as construction materials on the world’s many Wonders. These construction materials can be earned by making matches with special kinds of symbols while playing, so there’s more incentive to playing each level than simply dropping the cornerstone to the bottom of the screen. That being said, if you don’t collect all of the resources before activating this cornerstone, you might miss out on valuable building materials and will have to play extra match-three levels as a result. Either way, each Wonder will take anywhere from 6-10 levels to complete, depending on your skill level and patience, and you must complete these Wonders before unlocking further groups of levels to play back at the World Map. You’ll also be able to build a small town for your human and alien friends, with trees, flowers, businesses, homes, statues and more being placed on your choice of highlighted circles as you progress.This city-building section of the game is incredibly light, but it serves as a nice change of pace from the rest of the game that could benefit from some added variety. It would be nice to see more challenges thrown into each level, other than their time limits, and the option to change the method of making matches would also be appreciated (say, by allowing us to simply click on groups of matching symbols, rather than swapping two of their locations as normal).Even so, 7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover is simply an awesome match-three game that contains incredibly fluid, polished gameplay that screams of an attention to detail which so many other games lack. It may not come with all of the bells and whistles that one might expect from a modern game in the match-three genre, but it still contains everything you need for a fun afternoon (or two, or ten), which is really all we can ask for.Highly Recommended "

			While nobody knows for sure, it is most likely not historically accurate to have aliens visit earth and force humans into match 3 labor to craft temples in their honor.		

While nobody knows for sure, it is most likely not historically accurate to have aliens visit earth and force humans into match 3 labor to craft temples in their honor.The simplistic matching gameplay is functional but doesn't have any features to make it stand out.  The unstable framerate also weakens the experience as a whole.			"

												This game is a must play for any fan of mach three games. It has nice graphics and sound that are always nice, but  what makes it stands out is the game play. They have add a lot of elements into the mach three mechanic that make the game very fun to play. During stages you have to mach blocks to clear all the ruble, then mach blocks to gather resources you can build wonders with, then bring one special piece to the bottom of the screen. Also, you have a lot a different power ups that affect the board in various ways. All this adds to the game play, you're always trying to go after an objective. The game doesn't get repetitive. There's a macro game of building the wonders, witch is nice, but not the focus. Beside all that you get some mini games too. The mini game to unlock the special powers is the most fun to do, but the orders are nice too. Overall this one of the best match three games on steam and I would recommend it to anyone.			"

												This is a lovely game with great graphics, a nice ""Zen"" mode for people who don't want pressure and a sort of line of  goals that is very pleasent. I've worked through the whole game myself, and my 6 year-old grandson can play for hours. What's nice is that besides the 3-in-a-row thing, more advanced players can also try for all the building blocks and/or all the special colored squares - all of this gives the game another level of challenge. Great Game!			"

												Where the original 7 Wonders game falls short, this more than picks up the pieces.Yes, another gem-matching game, we've seen a million of them before, but this also has the added bonus of a few exciting power-ups and some separate story and game mechanics. I'm rather fond of the 'create your own village' element, where you add buildings and decorations to create an environment which is uniquely yours, and also great are the bonus levels which require a little more in the way of lateral-thinking.I'd go into greater detail, but the game description is pretty accurate! Suffice it to say I've played for circa 7 hours, which, for a £7 game means I've probably gotten my money's worth, though I daresay I'll be coming back to this eventually!While I can't jump for joy and scream from the heavens that this is a brilliat game, I'm going to hit the 'thumbs-up' button despite this game being a tad on the expensive side.And - as usual - a video accompanies my review:

												7 Wonders: AAM is match-three puzzle game, similar to Bejeweled. I've never been a fan of Bejeweled... I've always found the game to be really boring, but this game adds a bunch of elements to the formula, and for me, this game succeeds where Bejeweled fails: in providing clear goals as you play. This is apparently the fifth game in this series, but it's the first I've played.As you play, you have several goals you have to keep in mind. You need to make a match of a certain color over the colored cells (optional), you have to get as many resources as possible by making matches with the resource tiles (optional), and you have to break away the background and make a piece fall to the bottom to complete the level. It was much easier for me to stay engaged with this game as I tried to fulfill every goal on the level.There's sort of a meta-game where you use the puzzles to build things, but it doesn't do much for me. The story is incredibly stupid, but it's unintrusive. This is definitely a game built for touch screens, and the keyboard/mouse controls suffer a little for it. But, the only reason you get a game like this is for the puzzles, and I found them fun. The game's tutorial is complete garbage, unfortunately, and it almost prevented me from playing at all. You must read the help screens to play.I'd pick up this game if you see it cheap. There's no shortage of good casual puzzle games, and I'd buy up games like Plants vs. Zombies or Zuma's Revenge first. If you enjoy match-three games, I'd recommend this one. If you don't, you might still find something you like here.			"

												A very fun installment to the series. I'm a sucker for customizing stuff, so being able to add buildings, structures, and plants wherever you want in your town is right up my alley. The gameplay hasn't changed much, though the entire game itself seems much easier than any of the previous ones. It only took two run-throughs of (many, not even all) of the wonders to unlock all of the achievements.Worth buying, for sure. This series is my favorite casual game series ever, and this new installment does not stray far from what made the original great!			"

												Not my favorite in the series, but certainly good for a day or two of distraction.Because it's the 7 Wonders series, how much replay value you get here will depend on how okay you are with replaying the same levels over again.I liked the mini-games offered on the side, but the bonus power-ups these mini-games rewarded for use in your main game felt a bit too powerful, especially after I'd collected all of them.In the later, more complicated levels, I felt like I wasn't succeeding so much on my abilty to match tiles before the timer ran down, but because I was using the various power-ups to short-cut my way to victory.Still, the game is a pleasant distraction if you already enjoy the 7 Wonders series, and you aren't expecting the best game in the series for your money.

												If you like Bejeweled this game is for you. It is cute and easy to learn with new challenges every step of the way. At the same time you get to build a small town/village and unlock minigames. Building the wonders is more complicated than I thought during my first Wonder. It is not just click on anything and be done with it. One achievement was to complete a Wonder in seven levels. This could only be achieved with some consideration as to where I would put my resources. Adding one piece of the Wonder unlocks other positions. Figuring out which will be unlocked is crucial to be aware of to not waste a round by still having resources on hand. If it had been more advanced with this I would have enjoyed the game a whole lot more! It felt like a small tease. If the developers had built the game around the resources and the building of Wonders, making a demand for the player to be considerate about the placements, this game would have been so much better.Even so I recommend it for all my fellow Bejeweled-players out there. 7 Wonders is a nice variant of the classic game and should be played.
