												the game is a real gem. In my humble opinion its one of the best strategy games ever made. just ignore the metascore. many german magazines rated it higher than rome 1.and i dont understand why people here think this game is simple. it is actually pretty complex and provides loads of statistics and data to the player - some of it maybe a bit ""hidden"" for the superficial players. like already mentioned, the land battles can be very challenging, even for experienced armchair-generals -but i dont consider this to be a bad thing...at all. Also this game had sea battles long before the tw-series and they still look fantastic. but the best thing about this game is still the music. especially the tracks that play during the map-mode are incredibly beautiful. check this one out guys, you won't regret it. for 3 euros its a steal.

												If you are a fan of the total war series, this game is for you, keep in mind that Imperial Glory was made in 2005, it's in my opnion on the same level as Empire, just much more simplar.In Empire total war, made in 2009, navel battles were a huge new feature,  Imperial Glory made in 2005 had already made a simple yet easily handled navel battle system.I prefer the navel battles in this game compared to Empire or Rome II total War myself.The land battles are nice, but unlike then new games, they don;t use bump mapping. There only problem I have with the game is there is no moral system, every battle is a fight to the death, troops can not feel the field and regroup. Otherwise if you're a fan of Empire tottal war I'd say give this game a show, and at the current price of £3.50 it's worth it.			"

												A very basic, yet fun RTS game. If you are seriously struggling with the Hardcore RTS games like Total War for example. And want an easier and less frustrating experience. This game is for you.In Imperial Glory you control the major superpowers of that era. And basically it boils down to two options. a Score victory or Total Victory. If you know what these two options are then this game should be a piece of cake. Plus the tutorial mode really helps out fresh RTS players to understand the basic controls of how to manage your empire. The User Interface once the game starts is simple to understand, plus all of the options tells you which key on your keyboard to press for a quick look around. The battles in this game are once again, easy to understand. I guess you can say if you want a less more frustrating experience with an RTS game i recommend this game first and foremost before trying out the big boys.I recommend this game.			"

												this game is like a simpler version of total war. that being said, give this game credit. the graphics and battlefields are, in my opinion, better than empire, and the battles are much harder. cavalry is much more realistic and can tear your lines to shreads and wreak havoc, and the lines arent much easier. i think this game is definately at total wars level and can compete with the big dogs if it wants. well worth the money			"

												Definitely a classic stab at TBS and RTS by Eidos (those guys that did Praetorians). The gameplay is simpler than a total war game yet features an extensive research tree and exciting combat that, in my opinion, holds up even today. Austria is a total♥♥♥♥♥♥though. Always trying to defend Eastern Europe from my clutches... your time will come Austria! Your time will come O_O

												Not An Imperial RTS Title, But It Works! Before I went to purchase Imperial Glory, I have got to say, I did my fair share of research on it, as I didn’t really know what type of a game I was throwing myself into. When I did look into it though, the information  was already enough to sway me into buying, hearing that it was a similar to the likes of Empire Total War. This however being a budget title, very cheap, and well did not take too much of a computer to run. That’s the basis of what convinced me to buy it, currently having  quite a weak laptop to run games on, so I gave it a try.When you first get into this game, it does take a while to progress through the campaign, its often very confusing at the start as-well. You can start to see the elements in which are similar to Empire TW, but do notice that its clearly not as good, which brought this game down for me. As I said earlier, it takes a while to actually do anything in this game, and so need to be patient, keeping it calm in the early stages. Im going to be honest, you attack anyone early on, your going to get f***ed up pretty easily. Once you have an army etc, it gets interesting, you can trade, form alliances, but that’s pretty much it. While playing this game it always felt as if I was playing a decent title though, graphics are good for the age, but you do have to realise that this game really is just for those who cannot run Empire. I would not purchase this game if I had Empire Total War there in my library, I just wouldn’t! Its for people who like a good RTS Strategy game, but may not have the option of good gaming rig to play them games on. But at least there is an option for players, a decent strategy title like Imperial Glory, requiring little to run really. Its ok for that set of aspects. It takes a while to experience any kind of glory really, but its a great option for those who like a good rts game, its a game that can run on just about anything.Overall:+ Decent Graphics+ Professional Look+ Easy To Run+ Gameplay Is Pretty Smooth- Feels Like Second Best- Lacks In Storytelling- Not Going To Win Any AwardsGood 7.5/10 That goes it for my short Imperial Glory Steam ReviewThanks,The-Sentinel-Gamer			"

												Ok let´s make a proper review of this game. This title has about 10 years old and for a game made that long ago, is one of the best strategic games i ever played ! So, i got this game for free in some giveway from a retailer website. Got it cuz i already played alot of Total War series and i´m really into this historic and strategic games. At the beginning it didn´t suprise me and was kind of boring actually, cuz i was used to other kind of game rules and gameplay (from Rome Total War mainly). After a couple hours playing i really got into the athmosfear of the game and i started to enjoy it. If you compare this game with Total War series, you rly can even do more things in this game than in the Rome Total War ( I compare it with RTW cuz both were made/launched around the same year ). Here you can have ships/nautic battles, while in RTW Battles like that are just automatic, while here, in the battle contact, soldiers mix themselves and you dont even know who´s dying if you don´t look at the number of troops, RTW has move battle consistency, better options and gameplay and a bigger map.I must also freeze the map rotation issue, while in Total War series you get a different battle map every time you move, in this game, the map is only 1 per partition (region) what, in my opinion is not a big of a problem, just a small detail.The graphics are pretty good for a game that was made 10 years ago, with nice details, what deffenitely provides you a good gameplay. If you are thinking about playing this game online with other people forget it, you won´t find anyone to play with (i speak for myself cuz i live in a small country and in a +or- remote location but maybe you have lucky).Once again, you can totally compare this game to Empire Total War due the historic timeline. If you ever played a Total War title and enjoyed it i totally recomend this game to you, its a rly good option to TW series, you should give it a try !It is a really nice game and for 5eur it´s completelly worth, even tought you can it cheaper in promotions...7/10PS: Sorry about some english mistakes, i think everyone gets it			"

												I would recommend for those who like empire. It is much simpler in terms of interaction with the game map. Diplomacy is essential: war, treaties and trade. Its better for those who like the battles. If you have a lower spec pc this is an ideal etw substitue as is less graphically powerful			"

												Imperial Glory has been out for awhile.  This was my first game I played, purchased the CD.  Its pretty straight forward, no complications.  When I saw this on Steam, snapped it for $4. and some cents, It has multi-player but I have not used that aspect?  So can't comment!  But the game is very addictive, with plenty of action.  You are given several countries to lead.   If you have never played game, don't choose, Austria.  It is the most difficult country to defend because it is surrounded by enemies.  Which love to gang up on the about the first 3-4 turns of the game.  Once you have played the game and get the hang of it, try Austria.   Each country or empire has a special strenght, the British, their Royal Navy and industry.  France, professional armies and cannon.  Prussia, military tactics.  Russia, population and plenty of territory to retreat from their attackers!   Plus u get to gobble up all of the secondary countries!  But watch out, they may be allied with a more powerful empire or two.    The key is to develop your country as quickly as possible and form alliances with others in order to survive!  Plenty of action, naval battles, army battles,  foreign policy action, trade, industrial growth and political structure.  All must be monitored and nutured in order to afford those huge armies and navies.  You can even foster political unrest in other countries, once you develop a huge budget!  So, yes its an oldie but a goody!  Recommend this action game!			"

												I have to say I love this game! If you have ever played old school strategy games its just like that. Its like Medieval one if you have ever played it. You get to play as five factions france,Britian,Prussia,Austria,Russia. there are many other smaller factions such as spain,ottomans,portugal,hanover,egypt,sweden and so on. I have to say though that I am kinda sad that you can't play as spain and the ottomans because they are two of the bigger small factions in the game.  This game can be very hard in the early parts of the game because if you invade one of the smaller nations other nations will come in and fight you and you wont be able to hold all of them off because you don't have the military to fight them, So pick your battles carefully. The way you get allies is by throwing money at them and getting them into your alliance that way, Once you have reached 100% likeness then they will join your faction. they can get liberated by having a enemy nation take their capital back. The ingame battles are nothing to brag about, their okay but if you spam a lot of cav you will win the day, there still fun. The only thing that makes me mad is that I feel like the whole game is being rushed and that time flys way too fast! and smaller nations join bigger nations way too soon, but that is just what I think. I know that there is a bug where after you win a battle it crashes so I would look up the fix online before ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it here on steam. I would also like to say there are a few mods on the internet that help fix the OP militia who can just into hand to hand combat and destroy your whole army xD Other then a few of these things its a great game and I love it so much, I wish there was a world war one mod for this game because I feel like it would be so good. Last words though is this is totally worth the five dollars or less, Its like you got yourself a sub just try it out and see if you like it. But really someone make that mod idea, I will give you idea and♥♥♥♥♥♥just please....Someone take up the sword and do it!			"

												As a lover of Total War series and other strategy games I can confirm I love this game!It's cheap, it has great strategy RTS battles, it's quick, it can be very easy if you know how to handle it.If you are a newbie, or if you want to discover the great world of strategic games, I recommend that you start with this game. It's easier than the others, it's fast, like, if you are in college or something and you don't really have time, a battle would take like 10-15 minutes, and it's very cheap. However it is old and some mecghanics are outdated but it's a really nice experience. So, let me finish, if you are a newbie and want to try Total War Napoleon, Empire, Rome, Shogun, or Men of War and Company of Heroes series, I'd suggest that you should try this game first. It's easy to understand, not very complicated. I rate this game 8/10 because it's old and because of the well known issues (bugs).			"

Graphics score - 6/10Effects of the game are awesome! All the way from blood and gore, to runny and exhaustion, to smoke from guns and even melee fights seem really awesome.Effect score - 10/10So I urge all to buy this game! It's a must have if you're a big RTS fan. Final score is a 10/10!			"

TLDR:It's basically Napoleon Total War, if it were programmed in the 90s by three color blind high school students on a Windows XP platform... but done really, really well.  Great game; fun, challenging, and deceptively deep, but aesthetically mediocre.  Grab it for ten dollars or less.Pros:+ Impressive (if limited) historical variety and depth+ AI will pose something of a challenge for most players+ Fairly innovative gameplay for its day (circa 2005)+ Decent manual covers most of the necessary detailsMids:* Music is out of place, but not horrible* Graphics are kludgy, but not terrible either* Marginally useful tutorial covers the fundamentalsCons:- Awkwardly redundant interface; easy to forget steps- Severe time requirements for builds, movement, etc.- Limited number of nations; Small armies and naviesConclusion:Definitely didn't expect to favor this game.  Seemed like a bad Total War knock-off (until I realized they actually pioneered much of what Sega & EA did with Empire... but years before).  Ultimately, I found myself wanting to give it a fair shake.The developers (Pyro Studios) certainly won't be accused of producing a AAA title here, but if you can dismiss the limited aesthetics, it will reward your time with a lot of historical flavor and enjoyment.Get it on sale for $10.00 or less, and it's worth adding ""just one more game"" to your library, and you may just find yourself playing ""just one more turn"".===================================Fixes:===================================Game Crashes:Open ""Steam\steamapps\common\Imperial Glory""Right click ""Properties"", and then ""Compatibility""Select ""Windows XP (Service Patch 3)""Note: Ignore quotes, which were only used for delineation.

												Here's how it all went down:I started off as Great Britan. The people needed a good, strong leader, and because of reasons, they thought that I would fit the bill.I started doing what any person would do, spending all the money on a military, opening up trade routes, and scamming other countries into buying my ""quality"" materials that I was only to happy to get rid of. (we were a bit overstocked on them)In attempts to increase government/military quality, I decided it might be best to forget about educations and hospitals to focus on more important things. Trading and Diplomacy.As my diplomacy skills went up, I wanted to be better friends with the surrounding nations, so I gave France ten bucks to strengthen our relationship. They were not amused, and it backfired on me. With that out of the way I decided that the best move from here was to wipe Denmark of the face of the map, for the sole reason being that it was there. I put my troops on a ship, and once I could convince them to swim to shore, I had to make a bunch of allies so I could march across other peoples land on my way to Denmark. I attack. It was a hard fight in the mountains, and we sustained heavy casulties, but we drove them back. VICTORY......until they brought in a bigger, meaner army for reinforcments and then gave me a whoopin. With my army crippled, and thus my country, I threw in the towl. Well played Denmark, well played. In all seriousness, I bought the game on sale for 49 cents. I don't think it's quite as big,  detailed or complex as some of the newer Total War games, but it seems easier, which is good for RTS newbs like me. With that in mind, and you don't mind outdated graphics, then you might consider giving this a try. You could go on adventures like the one above.... :)Overall, 8.5 out of 10			"

												This game came out just before Rome Total War did due to that it was kinda overshadowed by a popular AAA turnbased strategy game.  The best way to sum this up is this is essentially Napoleon: Total War with Romes graphics. This has Naval battles, land battles, a tech tree, different approaches to diplomacy. You can peacefully annex entire countries if you play it right. If you can look past the 2005 graphics and the limited playable nations this is a great game and a welcomed unearthed relic thats been added to steam.			"

												In today's grand strategy market, Imperial Glory is basically just a poor man's Empire/Napoleon Total War. However, when this game originally came out in 2005, those games didn't exist. At the time Imperial Glory was a pretty good grand strategy game set in Europe and northern Africa from the last 1700s to the early 1800s. Even today that is mostly true. Imperial Glory does suffer from some compatibility problems with newer operating systems, but for me those were all fixed by running the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3. Graphically the game does definitely look dated. That being said, that doesnt stop the real time battles from still being large impressive set pieces. The turn based campaign map lacks the realistic birds eye view from the newer Total War games but it still depicts the game world pretty well in my opinion. The player gets a ""Risk"" like map that looks like a real general's map in some army camp with little board game pieces to represent armies and navies (yes there is also naval warfare). Gameplay should be very similar to those familiar with Total War games. It consists of playing as either Russia, Prussia, the UK, France, or Austria in a massive campaign to take over all of Europe. There are also smaller NPC empires such as Spain and the Ottoman Empire. The UI has aged well over the years. Though it might seem daunting, the game is actually quite simple and the tutorial teaches almost all that is required. This game is no Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings. The real time battles are also basically what you would expect from a grand strategy game. It plays almost the same as a Total War game except for one huge missing factor which will turn off some players. For some reason Pyro Studios never thought that it was a good idea to include a unit morale system. Thus your units feel more like automatons than actual human beings. They will literally fight to the death when outnumbered 20 to 1. There are also historical battles which follow the conquests and defeat of Napoleon and multiplayer/bot skirmishs. So in conclusion, this is a game I recommend to anyone interested in a poor man's Total War game that has a somewhat humble presentation, yet does not have any game breaking bugs *cough* Rome 2 *cough*.Lastly I love the soundtrack			"

												This is basically Empires: Total War. I had never played any of the total war games until steam had a total war weekend, and although I definitely would choose to play a total war game before i'd choose to replay this one due to the wider maps and stronger gameplay, this game does not lag behind. I'm not sure who developed this, but when i play Total War Empires, there isnt a single element of the game that doesnt lead me to believe that Total war blatantly plagarized this entire game. For being made 3 years before Rome and about 6 years before Empires, Imperial Glory beat the Total War series to the punch in Naval RTS. I see no significant difference between the Naval element of this game vs Empires Total War's Naval battles, except maybe asthetics. Even at 5 bucks this is a bargain, but if u're pinching pennies, this goes on sale often at anywhere from .99 to 2.99. Again, if ure a fan of the Total War games, grand and/or real time strategies, BUY THIS GAME.Pros:-Almost entirely Identical to total war empires minus injuh and amrika.-Flawless integration of RTS in this Grand Strategy-Fantastic Retail price-up to 100, 12 turn years of game play-Had Naval RTS 5 years before total war (Naval engine feels identical to that of Empires Total War)-Graphics more than adequite-Diplomacy is WAY more comprehensive than Total War games. In Total War Empires I felt like i could easily cheat the other nations with bribery and fake diplomacy. For instance, if i was at war with a nation, all it would take is a little cash to get a peace accord signed, which meant i could go and conquer a few territories of a nation and then afterwards i could get a peace treaty signed and keep the countries that i conquered, and generally, they wouldnt do♥♥♥♥♥♥about it as long as our diplomatic relations are set at ""peace"". In Imperial glory, I couldn't put anything past the AI and i had to genuinely practice good diplomacy to earn the trust of my fellow emperors, otherwise they reigned hell down on me. This, I think, is something Total war has never been able to master.Cons:-No india or america theatre-RTS is somewhat limited by comparison to Total war, but not so much that u want to skip the battles. Here are my complaints of the RTS:    =limited map diversity    =less comprehensive defensive features    (The next one is sort of a pro as well)    =Occupation is a prolonged process. it takes many turns to annex a nation and requires a considerable amount of troops to do so. In retrospect, Total war adapted their own version of this by letting the people rebel throughout the game which i think makes it easier to play. So basically, this game is more challenging militarily speakingEDITOH!!! and I have win 8.1 and it did crash a couple times, however the autosave is super frequent. i never lost my place the few times that it did crash, and furthermore, the crashes that i had in Total War weren't any less frequent. I've been reading a lot of the neg reviews, and it seems the only consistent complaints are the crashes. Seriously, dont let that prevent u from buying this game, especially if u like the Total war style grand/rt strategy genre at a really really really cheap price. Imperial Glory was the framework that TOTAL WAR based their games on. dont wait for the movie, read the book. Total war is the movie. Imperial Glory is the book.			"

												If you have Windows 7 or anything above XP you're taking a big gamble as to whether or not this game will launch.I can't believe Steam allows games to be in it's store that are not guaranteed to run on Modern systems without any warning. Luckly I'm only out a $1. Steam already knows everything about all of our systems a simply notification before purchasing would have been nice.			"

												Why should you buy this game? well if you like RTS games- this game has depth, it will take many hours to complete- even from 2005 it is still enjoyable to watch- building tree with diff focus, army, political etc you need to plan what to build where - technology tree - battlefields have terrain that slows down your troops, can enter buildings, if you happen to kill enemy squad of artillery without destroying the cannons you will be able to take them after battle.- naval battles are complex, if you maage 1 ship is enjoyable, with many at same time gets difficult, but details are nice, this is 2005 much earlier Total war series introduced naval battles.IT IS ON SALE FOR 0.99!!!!!I still have the dvd version from years ago, i played campaign with every fation, one of the few games i actually repllayed, if you get half the joy I did ou will still feel guilty for paying such a price....BUY IT!!

												One of best wargames ever made. Graphics are tight but decent and with low requirements. Only has one technical bug: sometimes crushes after choose play a battle. Mechanics is easy and fast to learn but quite deep, the AI is not so treacherous and cheater like in later games more famous ( altought England is shamefully enhanced when ruled by AI ). Highly recommedable for introducing in full srategy, and for everyone interested in napoleonic period. Injustly underrated and unknown. Really cheap. Its a true pitty that there are no more games with same system in other historic ages.			"

												The overall gameplay of this game is fantastic, a mix of strategy/politics with warfare. I would definitely recommend this game, BUT this game sometimes just randomly crashes for me at least. Right after an important battle, BAM it crashes. Just built a complex trading route? Crash. Negotiated a treaty with France? Crash. This made me paranoid about saving. There is an autosave feature, but it rarely ever saves on its own. I feel there are better games in this genre, but i got it on sale for 2 bucks, which is about a bottle of soda and a bag of chips. If you do decide to purchase this, be sure to save after everything you do.			"

												This is a terrible game.  It looks like it was poor when it came out, and it is just awful now.I was excited about the prospect of the historical context, looking for something less fussy than other games representing this era.  But it utterly fails to represent any historical reality whatsoever.  The rules are arbitrary and have nothing to do with reality of the era at all.And the mechanics are a ridiculous chore: improving ""sympathy"" (relations) with other countries is done by trading, but are not automatable. So each turn is a lengthy clickfest to make 1/2% improvements.Do not waste your time checking to see if this slipped past you.  You missed nothing but frustration and disappointment.			"

												Imperial Glory is not at all what i expected.  A friend got this game for me, while it was on sale for 59p. For it's age, Imperial  Glory can still compete with other, more modern games of its type. Though the graphics are not the best, the game mechanics are in many respects better than the likes of Empire and Napoleon Total War. If you have played either of these, you will be well aware than when two units clash in melee, it is not uncommon for several men from each unit to be doing nothing while a few others fight and the rest get in the way looking for an opponent. Well Imperial Glory, now 10 years old, actually doesn't do that. It was really good to watch the intense melee with everyone taking part. Though indeed the kill moves, and graphics cannot compete with the likes of Empire and Napoleon Total War, it was a nice part of the game that i really enjoyed. The sound effects and general playstyle is very similar to that of Napoleon and Empire too, but from my short playtime, it is a lot faster and seems a lot less buggy. I like how the lines all fire pretty much at the same time, but the reloads are a bit too fast. I found the interface a bit tricky to work out, but i soon got the hang of that and everything was fine. Formations cannot be changed merely by right click and dragging the unit across the map, as you can in Empire and Napoleon, at least i couldn't get it to work like that. Unit sizes are pretty small which realy is the bggest downside to the game, and it kinda kills the realism, but really its fast paced and relatively easy playstyle really does make it a game still worthy of some respect, in many ways better than most games from the Total War series.

												Honestly I love this game, it is an amazing strategy and I have actually played this before other strategy games and I just got more attached to this game. So here are some pros and cons.Pros: 1. Graphics(For its time)2. Sound effects.3. The battles are amazing, especially in the campaign. All units fire at the same time.4. Physics on cannon balls(I always order my cannons to fire as far as they can)5. Naval combat is just amazing!Cons:1. Sometimes after a battle the game crashes(Please fix it, Im currently doing the same battle over and over again till it finally stops)2. Nothing else!All in all I would recommend this game to anyone!			"

												The game is a really good stategy game and the developers of it have the potential to compete with Total War games. Managing an empire in this game is a lot more smooth than Total War, as there are more resources to manage and control. Building and recruiting units are pretty straightforward and easy to understand. The combat itself is quite lacking compared to other strategy games, but for the price it is worth it. The battles are at a much smaller scale than other games that are similiar, and the terrain of battles in certain areas is basic and never changes. The naval battles are well done for the price of the game, and enjoyable if you know what you are doing. The only thing that is bad about the game is it crashes about every 3 battles and you have to redo everything since your last save (including the battle it crashed on) when this happens. The crashes happen regardless of what computer you have and can get really annoying. Other than the crashes i have no problems with the game and find it enjoyable. I would reccomend this game for its current price and am surprised at how well it was developed. If you are not patient with crashes the game is not worth it though.			"

												I would call it a good global strategy game for those, who don't want to dive deep into details.Although it was launched 10 years ago, I had really enjoyed playing it nowdays. I played the campaign for the UK, mostly due to it's naval warfare accent, and skipped almost all the battles, except deceive ones. And the game gave me every kind of experience, I wanted: building fleet, founding colonies in Northen Africa, landing troops in Crimea, setting maritime blockade upon enemy's trade and hunting for his fleet etc, I really liked it.Advantages of this game are:- developed political activity, that plays major part in the game;- good macroeconomics, that doesn't take much effort to held, but wouldn't alloy you to neglet it, and allows you to make some economical pressure on opponent;- very good global naval strategy realisation, which was the main reason for me to play it.The only disadvantage I could recall after finishing the campaign is the battles, I have to play when I didn't wanted to, because of unfair battle auto-calculation. It happens sometimes.Someone would like Total War series more, but this is a good one and worth to play.			"

												I would not reccomend this game. It is missing very basic things that all games like this should have like a balanced combat system, functional diplomacy, and even unit replenishment. (Unit replinishment can only happen late game if you choose a certain tech tree). The A.I  always plays defensivley in battles and it usually crashes after battles. The game has very little variety with only 5 factions to play as that all are basically the same. The A.I constantly sends offers to trade for unessicary things like food for all your money. If you deny them this deal, than you get a relationship hit with that country and after a few turns of that than they declare war on you. If you want to start a war, be ready to fight the whole map, because even your own allies will betray you and fight against you because ""reasons"". Please don't waste your money on this game and buy a Total War game.			"

												I think that this game is awesome. It is very simple, and I understand that it could definantly do with alot of simple improvements, such as range of the cannon (which is suprisingly short), and perhaps some more military diversity (There is just 4 land army unit 'types' in the game) which are your horsemen, light infantry, Infantry,  and cannons. Ships are just the same.But this game is old, very old, made in 2005. Shouldn't be too suprising that some of these things are missing. And crashes, too, it's definantly not meant to run on modern computers. But it's still a good game, you don't have to be the world's smartest genius to win the game, and neither do you have to conquer the world with all-powerful military might. There is a score win system in the game, which I like after playing a game such as Empire: Total War where the only real way to win is to shoot everything that isn't you. I mean, Empire, not a bad game by any means, but I think it could have gone with some diversity when it comes to winning.So, really, I think this is a good game and while it does have problems because of it's age, it's still a good, simple game, plenty of enjoyment out of it.

												Imperial Glory is one of the best RTS games i'd say, If you're a fan of games like Age of Empires or Divinity Dragon Commander or anything that's like that then this is your game.For a game that's from 2005 it's still quite a blast, i'd play it for about 3-4 hours non stop and for a game like that, it's quite an achievement.Alright i'll start by saying you need to play this game for ATLEAST more than 5 hours to COMPLETELY understand how much content it has, at first it does indeed look ugly and really half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with it's fair share of bugs but it's really fun, though one of the really annoying things is you can only play as one of 5 europian powers, and there's about 15 or more civils so it feels like that's been completely ignored or just rushed at devoloupment.Anyways you have two ways to play the game, A ""Total Victory"" type of campaign where you HAVE to unite the entire map, as in just fight every single dude who says no, or just buy every single country (except for capitals which you can't buy :<) till you get the entire world in your hands, or a ""Score Victory"" where you just have to get the most score. (just build build build and spam peace everywhere.) and the other way is to play one of the four battles that are all related to France and Napoleon at the early 1800's which is a bit of a shame really.The ""Total Victory"" is pretty much the best way to play the game, it has the most content and would take you about 15-25 hours to complete atleast one campaign with that way.Since it's the best way i'll start by explaining it, first off you pick your civil, then you have one of three ways to completely dominate a country/civil, One way is just buy everything they have till they only own their capital, Then just invade that. There's also a ""Peaceful"" way to completely annex them via just building newspaper offices and consolates and loads of other buildings to force them to like you all the way till they give you everything they have (units - land - resources) This way is gonna cost you ALOT but it's really worth it, and of course it's worth it later on since you get like 4000 gold each turn which is abit overpowered but still is fair since you really need gold at all times along with other resources. Third way is to go with a large army with/without help of anyone else and just try to completely destroy your enemy, I'd go with peaceful since the A.I generates a big army in somewhat of a short while.Now i would NEVER recommend speedrunning this game as it's also kind of impossible, i'd say just try to get as many allies as you can and build a strong civil.At first gameplay feels abit slow and also earning resources is abit slow but you quickly improve yourself same as the A.I.Also the A.I devoloups quickly same as you and it fights somewhat good in battles it feels like you're not fighting an A.I, still you can get an edge over it so i'd say that's good enough.So i said alot of things and overall the game is really good but let's start talking about the bugs and the annoying things that we all hate.First off like i said above ^ the first things you notice is there's not that many battles and or ways to play the game which feels like the just rushed it and also you can't play as every single civil.And when i said map/world map, the world isn't complete. It's mainly europe and north africa and west asia so it's really not that much, and there's not that much attention to detail, ottoman empire has just 3 territories and all of them are REALLY large, then next to it is just Egypt which feels like there could be way more attention to detail there.Also when the A.I hates you, they literally hate you, they'll completely deny EVERY single political related crap you send except for improving relations with SO many resources or buying territory/land from them which also feels like they lacked detail there.Anyways to just not make this longer, Overall the game is great for a 2005 one, If it's under $10 i'd say it's a must own but more than that then it's not worth it unless it gets updated and adds more polish and attention to detail. (mind you the high/ist resolution is 1024x768) so i'd give it a 7/10			"

												CAMPAIGN MAPImperial Glory takes aspects from the early Total War game Shogun, using the exact same troop movement and province control on the campaign map. The unique feature of moving your troops anywhere in a province as long as you only move to one province per turn. Moving a unit stack to a new province will simulate your men gathering supplies and getting ready to move out, thus you cannot interact with that unit again until next turn. That includes the transferring of units from barracks to armies, or armies to armies. In order to take over provinces you must move your army which consists of 3 units to the target area to immediately take it over. If an enemy army is stationed in that province you will begin a battle at the beginning of the next turn. If the targeted province is the capital of the country that you are at war with, you will begin seiging that province for however many turns depending on the quality of units you have.RESEARCH TREEThe research tree is mandatory to advance in the campaign, without any technologies you will only be able to recruit Militia, which is the most basic melee based infantry unit. Advancing in the research tree allows you to build barracks, cavalry stables, cannon depots, and other economic/cultural buildings. In order to gain a constant flow of incom you must research the trade technology to unlock trade routes to friendly countries. It is a pretty standard research tree compared to any other TW game.DIPLOMACYDiplomacy is kinda limited to the research tree as well as everything else at the beginning. You only start with 4-5 options for diplomacy until you advance further into the campaign. I'm not a big dimplomatic player anway, so I won't go further into detail.OPTIONSThe options have some variety to the graphics and sounds, the only thing I really consider not up to my standards is that the resolution doesnt go up to 1920x1080. BATTLE MAPThe battle map is very similar to a Total War game, you play as the commander using a birds eye view of the battle field to direct your troops. The troop deployment is more similar to Shogun and the actually troop manuevering is more alike Real Warfare. The combat is a very simple representation of early 19th century warfare. The front rank of line infranty are the only sprites to actually fire their weapons, while the rear two ranks sit in reserve. Obviously this would not really be the case but due to game limitations its understandable. Militia units are the most basic units that are recruitable from the very start of the game. They are only limited to melee and are sometimes very over powered, because they have more melee strength than line infantry, probably to simulate the larger numbers. The UI in the combat map makes it so you do not have to use any hotkeys if you do not want to and that is fine with me. The AI is pretty... not good to be honest. The Infantry would rather engage in melee than engage in ranged combat which can make things a little iffy strategy wise. More will come when I continue to play the game.			"

												Imperial Glory is one of the best RTS games i'd say, If you're a fan of games like Age of Empires or Divinity Dragon Commander or anything that's like that then this is your game.For a game that's from 2005 it's still quite a blast, i'd play it for about 3-4 hours non stop and for a game like that, it's quite an achievement.Alright i'll start by saying you need to play this game for ATLEAST more than 5 hours to COMPLETELY understand how much content it has, at first it does indeed look ugly and really half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with it's fair share of bugs but it's really fun, though one of the really annoying things is you can only play as one of 5 europian powers, and there's about 15 or more civils so it feels like that's been completely ignored or just rushed at devoloupment.Anyways you have two ways to play the game, A ""Total Victory"" type of campaign where you HAVE to unite the entire map, as in just fight every single dude who says no, or just buy every single country (except for capitals which you can't buy :<) till you get the entire world in your hands, or a ""Score Victory"" where you just have to get the most score. (just build build build and spam peace everywhere.) and the other way is to play one of the four battles that are all related to France and Napoleon at the early 1800's which is a bit of a shame really.The ""Total Victory"" is pretty much the best way to play the game, it has the most content and would take you about 15-25 hours to complete atleast one campaign with that way.Since it's the best way i'll start by explaining it, first off you pick your civil, then you have one of three ways to completely dominate a country/civil, One way is just buy everything they have till they only own their capital, Then just invade that. There's also a ""Peaceful"" way to completely annex them via just building newspaper offices and consolates and loads of other buildings to force them to like you all the way till they give you everything they have (units - land - resources) This way is gonna cost you ALOT but it's really worth it, and of course it's worth it later on since you get like 4000 gold each turn which is abit overpowered but still is fair since you really need gold at all times along with other resources. Third way is to go with a large army with/without help of anyone else and just try to completely destroy your enemy, I'd go with peaceful since the A.I generates a big army in somewhat of a short while.Now i would NEVER recommend speedrunning this game as it's also kind of impossible, i'd say just try to get as many allies as you can and build a strong civil.At first gameplay feels abit slow and also earning resources is abit slow but you quickly improve yourself same as the A.I.Also the A.I devoloups quickly same as you and it fights somewhat good in battles it feels like you're not fighting an A.I, still you can get an edge over it so i'd say that's good enough.So i said alot of things and overall the game is really good but let's start talking about the bugs and the annoying things that we all hate.First off like i said above ^ the first things you notice is there's not that many battles and or ways to play the game which feels like the just rushed it and also you can't play as every single civil.And when i said map/world map, the world isn't complete. It's mainly europe and north africa and west asia so it's really not that much, and there's not that much attention to detail, ottoman empire has just 3 territories and all of them are REALLY large, then next to it is just Egypt which feels like there could be way more attention to detail there.Also when the A.I hates you, they literally hate you, they'll completely deny EVERY single political related crap you send except for improving relations with SO many resources or buying territory/land from them which also feels like they lacked detail there.Anyways to just not make this longer, Overall the game is great for a 2005 one, If it's under $10 i'd say it's a must own but more than that then it's not worth it unless it gets updated and adds more polish and attention to detail. (mind you the high/ist resolution is 1024x768) so i'd give it a 7/10			"

												The game play is slow and awkward. Trade with other countries by sea is difficult at best. To embark then unload troops is way off...2 turns.(2 months) to cross English channel.  The game crashes after every battle that you manage but not if you ""auto"" resolve it. This is a very big ""turn-off"" and kills this game at any price. Another piece of crap from STEAM.			"

												I think that this game is awesome. It is very simple, and I understand that it could definantly do with alot of simple improvements, such as range of the cannon (which is suprisingly short), and perhaps some more military diversity (There is just 4 land army unit 'types' in the game) which are your horsemen, light infantry, Infantry,  and cannons. Ships are just the same.But this game is old, very old, made in 2005. Shouldn't be too suprising that some of these things are missing. And crashes, too, it's definantly not meant to run on modern computers. But it's still a good game, you don't have to be the world's smartest genius to win the game, and neither do you have to conquer the world with all-powerful military might. There is a score win system in the game, which I like after playing a game such as Empire: Total War where the only real way to win is to shoot everything that isn't you. I mean, Empire, not a bad game by any means, but I think it could have gone with some diversity when it comes to winning.So, really, I think this is a good game and while it does have problems because of it's age, it's still a good, simple game, plenty of enjoyment out of it.

I came across this game and did some research and it looked to me that it would be well worth 5 dollars. (WELL WORTH)Turns out if you own a Windows 8 you can't even play the damn game.. Now I know that steam has all of my system settings, so my question is why could it not tell me that this game is unplayable?? Oh well I guess. I hope to be somehow getting my money back. All in all very disappointed in steam. They are better than this!! -_-			"

												I love this game , butttttt OMG it crashes so often at very bad moments. You have to save game A LOT! because it can crash any second , at loading screen or moving unit to next place or just pausing a game , main thing is to save A LOT because i did not few times , it crashed and 1 hour work was gone , and it has crappy autosave. Game in general is good , combat is so cool and clashes between units is awesome , map is huge , there isn`t any story , and it is expected, you just have to win all battles and take every territory. It has few modes like historical battles which are cool. Graphics for 2005 game are very cool , game is slow very slow at some times but it gets better after 1 hour of playing. This game crash thing ruins game very much but if you can fix it or learn how to not cause one or learn how to be careful it will be fine. Get the game now for 74 cents or wait for other sale.			"

												Having not played a RTS game since Conflict for the NES, I wanted to give the genre another try. I already had accumulated a few different RTS games from various bundles that I had purchased over the last couple of years. Every time I tried a new one, I was provided with little to no direction in the way of tutorials and felt very lost in the game. I found this one on sale and picked it up. I played through the three tutorials and they explained the game in very good detail. The game runs really well on both my desktop and laptop, with compatibility settings for Windows 98/ME. The graphics are simple enough that it runs well on older PCs. I am thoroughly enjoying this game. It is easy to grasp and a lot of fun with endless replay value. I am sure that it is not one of the ""top"" RTS titles out there, but for its simplicity and tutorials I am very happy with it. If you want something simple to get into and don't require a lot of frilly graphics, I think you will like this game.			"

												To start off,  Imperial Glory  is a non-linear, Total War style rts with map based strategy and overhead control of soldiers. It is most similar to  Empire: Total War , taking place in the same time period, 1700-1800. Being released in 2005 for pc and 2006 for mac, you would come to expect this game to be unapealing, especially with larger franchises that are so similar, but that is not the case. Here I am going to explain why.    Imperial Glory brings to the table many things that I have yet to see in a game of this style before such as population based recruiting, and missions that can give you many bonuses such as buildings being built instantly or elite units. The graphics and audio may not be the greatest, even for the time it came out, but we all have to remember that graphics and audio don't make a game.    The gameplay is where this game really shines in my eyes. Though once again similar to Empire: Total War in this aspect, it is very unique, in some ways even better than Total War. The map phase of the game, which is only in Europe, has far fewer provinces than Total War, this allows each game to be much faster and more action oriented while adding a less strategic depth making the game easier to grasp. All units are relatively small making the combat more strategy focused, though still not too difficult.  Pros  Unique gameplay Easy to grasp Good replay value Fast paced Cheap Non-Linear Decent AI Unique Resources Cons  Bad graphics and audio Little to no players in multiplayer Not the best optionIn the end this is just a cheap version of total war, but note,  cheap . It's a good game to buy for a few hours of fun and is well worth $5 or less, but best to buy it on sale for best value.			"

Yes it is a few years older and I had never heard of this game until the I purchased it, but as far as older games go this one has aged very well . Other than a few minor complaints about interface on the over world, looking at data and troop movement and placement, again I would say this one is well worth it. 8/10 for me.			"

												No glory. Bought this ten-year-old game for 97p in a sale. Wasn't expecting too much, except a few hours of distraction for this reviewer (who is a big fan of the Total War series). The AI is pretty limited and the battles didn't provide any real opportunity for the use of tactics. In fact, it was really just a slug-out between both sides with success down to the quality of your troops, as opposed to the use of terrain or manoeuvres. My biggest gripe is that after fighting for control of a faction's capital the game always - and I mean, always - crashed. This became very frustrating because even when I knew I could win control I would have to leave it to autoresolve to decide the outcome. The decision would usually go against me. It got to the point where rather than fight any battles, I autoresolved about 80-90% of matches rather than waste half an hour of fighting only for the game to crash on the end battle save. I eventually completed the game but it felt like a hollow victory. So, OK for 97p, I guess, but there are better (if more expensive) ways of spending gaming time.			"

												It's kinda like Empire: Total War with the old Medieval II: Total War engine, so yea, it's an okay game. But pick up the Total War games them selves instead of getting this if you've got more money. But if you're poor I can recomend this game! 6/10			"

												This game is not as good as total war empire/Napoleon. Cavalry is OP, cannons fire way too fast and are OP as well. There are no special abilities, range-finders,or moral, unit selection is very low, and you can't retreat from melee. Historical accuracy is also missing in many places. British riflemen have red uniforms, militia is just melee infantry, and the Black Watch is apparently the best British unit. All in all, this is a pretty bad game.			"

												If anyone reads this, I hope you can feel hope serious im being right now, DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!! Its not worth the dirt you walk on at a county park. First theres probably like a 50% chance of your mouse not working making the game unplayable (due to there crappy drivers having conflicts with most graphic cards (something like that, i emailed them about it and forget what the exact words were)) Second, the game crashes every half an hour which is a problem being games can last days. Its not a bad game but it runs like a fat man in the summer. I really wish this game worked, but i got it on sale for a dollar but for all you guys out there, dont waste 5 dollars. Go out and buy a homeless man a burger, get a gallon and a half of gas, hire a cheap hooker, I dont care just dont buy this game. I hope you read this before you read and good comments on this game because shurly anyone writing a good review on this game must either be related to the developers or sleeping with them. DONT BUY THIS GAME.... You got that? DONT. Say it with me ""I WONT BUY THIS GAME""...... good, now just repeat that a few times and you should be good.			"

												The least I can say is that I love this game. It is extremely fun, and rather in depth.I've played for 6 and a half hours now, I know it's not long, but its long enough. This game crashes. Alot.I was playing as Russia, trying to conquer the world. I had just captured Poland when Austria decides to go to war with me. So, I decided to make the first move. I sent two of my Colonels againts three of Austria's Captains, and I actually won. Then, while the game was loading, BAM! Crash. Lost the whole battle. Another time, I was playing as the French, and Prussia declared war on me. We had a gigantic fight that was even. It was loading, BAM! Blue screen. Most of the time, though, its just a normal ""Not Responding"" crash. I got it on sale for $.99, and even after all the crashes, I still love it. After all the crashing, I will still reccomend it.

												Wow. Tried one battle and knew this was a waste of time, money, space and memory. This game follows the same game play style as Empires: Total War, but Empires is like, 100 times better, maybe a 1000 times better. Let me re-enact a battle in words so you get to see all the problems with it:I choose to be Prussia against Austria. On a quick battle, it automatically brings up a castle in England. But you can select where you fight. Not wanting to fight in England, I choose some field(I forget the exact name.) It has some hills, mostly plain, with some lonely farm house on a hill. Also has a creek. My general begins rallying the men to fight valiantly and send the enemy running.I setup my troops behind the creek, daring the enemy to come across the creek, while also giving my cannons extra protection, knowing they have long and short range abilities. I setup my infantry and calvary in strategic positions. ""Ah ha"" I think ""I have the best advantage on the battle field""So the battle begins, and I have my cannons start firing on the advancing enemy....until I realize my cannons aren't firing cause they aren't in range of the enemy. So I move my cannons away from there nice, strategic positions, and start firing on the enemy advance, until I realize Im not hitting anything, except the ground to the side of the enemy advance.Meantime, I begin getting my calvary and infantry ready to engage the enemy, Austria. Now, in war games Ive played with calvary and infantry, its ALWAYS the calvary being the tougher, harder, more armoured units. They take more punishment in battle, the infantry lesser. Thats cause the horse makes them stronger. Even in history. Read about historical wars. Calvary units were tough, armoured, and designed to wreck havoc on the enemy. Thats why I like to mix in calvary.So, when my calvary and infantry meets Austria's calvary and some infantry, both sides immediately lose soldiers, at a very rapid rate. Meantime, most of Austria's infantry is coming towards my cannons, who, despite the infantry charging closer, and directly in its line of fire, is hitting the enemy troops 1 out of every4 shots, or so.To skip ahead, my loss's are so heavy at an alarming rate, Im sending all my units that are my ""reserves"" for later in the battle just to ensure Im winning! All the while, trying to keep some units to protect my pretty much useless cannons, hoping though that my cannons could cause some damage later on.Meantime, my cannon units have left the cannons to duel it out with there swords.Further east down the creek, my troops have won the battle there, with like 1 or 2 units left to defeat. Sadly, I have a ragtag group left of what was an impressive group of units.My cannon guys defeat the enemy troops there and can once again fire the cannons.To skip to the end, I win the battle, losing an outrageous amount of troops, my cannons couldn't hit the broadside of a barn, the Ai, march's there entire army, trying to outflank you. Unless they're defending a castle or fortress. Oh, and on the main menu, its dated a 2005 game. Yes, you saw right. 2005. It'll be 10 years old next year. In 10 years, alot happened, including better games coming out. I'd recommend Empires Total War over this game. Empires has similar gameplay, more factions, and more realistic cannons, battles, sound effects, everything. If your new to RTS games, or looking to get into them, you may like this game as a starting place to learn, but I'd recommend Age of Empires 2 for that. If your a RTS veteran or looking for a new game, I'd like to stick a big sign up now that says, BUYER BEWARE			"

												I made a review on this earlier today, but I was exhausted, due to staying up all night, and I wasn't in my right mind, obviously. So, here it goes again.Alot of people say Imperial Glory is alot like Empire: Total War, or Napoleon: Total War, and let me start off by saying it is NOTHING like the two of them. Matter of fact, it's way worse then them.I'm going to split this off to diffrent sections. Due to I have alot to cover.Gameplay/Timeline: Imperial Glory takes place in, before, during, and after the Napoleonic Wars era in Europe, and Northern Africa. There are tons of nations/factions in the game, such as the German States, the main coalition nations, such as Austria, Prussia, The United Kingdom, and Russia. The game features an awesome variety of nations, such as The Ottoman Empire, to Poland, to Egypt, hell, even to Morocco! But. There are only 5 nations playable. Yep. 5. Out of tons on the campaign map. France, Prussia, Russia, The United Kingdom, and Austria. This game is not one at all for variety. Every nation has amsot the exact same units. Two Skirm units, Three Line Infantry units, 5 Cavalry units, and I think 6 Artillery units. These conclude of the basic Horse Howitzer/Cannon, to normal cannon/howitzer, including Rockets. And Cavalry, Hussars, Lancer, And heavy cavalry units. The gameplay in IG can be really cool, or really bad. Buildings, and other cover areas are just straight up BS and OP. If you put a unit in a building, they will never die from fire, one guy infront will keep getting killed, over, and over again. Not anybody in the main building, while you can slaughter the opposing unit. This is a major problem in the campaign, which I wll get onto in the next section. Anyway, the combat is awesome if you get to go head-to-head. Your units fire in volleys, that don't take long to prepare, but to fire. Loading in this game is really fast. Matter of fact, a bit too fast. Rather then in NTW or ETW, they don't ram the ball 20 times in the barrel, but only about 3 or, 4, then, they take aim. And aim, and aim, and aim, and aim, and then fire. Whilst being annihilated in the proccess. It looks awesome, but it dosen't work at all. Your units may be able to fire a max of 2, 3 volleys in out-numbered. Also, they never aim where they're firing, this can be a problem with cav. One time, a group of lancers was charging head on to my Fusiliers, so, they aimed at the cav, I thought, ""Good, they'll get wrecked!"" I look back 30 seconds later, completley annihilated. It turns out they were firing at a unit that was to the LEFT of the cav. GG, G ♥♥♥♥ing G. Artillery is useless as-well. The cannon balls neven bounce. They will like, once and stop.. It's really annoying when you have to line a cannon next to fusilers, to do any damage. The cav also is OP as hell. They can decimate 4 units with 2 cav units within seconds. No chance to react, or anything. The melee on here is also awful. The animations are awesome, but, you can;'t run from melee! It's pretty much suicide, melee charging. Also, on a micselanious note, why does every guard unit look like the French Old Greneadier guard?Campaign: Oh boy, if this game was a peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥ the campaign would be the dihoreah filling on top. This game has an AWFUL campaign. With only 5 facion playability, you'll get bored really fast.if you're not into the nations. And, the things that ruin the most are faction dimplomacy, and battle AI. If you dare declare war on the smallest of nations, it will cause a WW1. Nations will flip out, and send massive armies to you. I invaded Morocco, and literaly, every nation but 3 declared war on me. OVER MOROCCO. Do you think WW2 Started because Italy invaded Etiopia? NO. Because people wouldn't risk their country over a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ african province, would they? And, if anybody declares war on you, people do ♥♥♥♥ all. Batavia was my ally, and Spain invaded, so you know what they did? Declared war on me. MY ALLY BETRAYED ME THAT I HELPED BEFORE. And, anytime you engage in a battle, the ♥♥♥♥ing AI hides in a house/farm, and refuses to move. Dosen't matter if you're attacking, defending, or both. You're in for a loooooooooong game.Meh. That's about it, nothing much else in the game. Maps are awful, graphics are too, Even for a 2005 game. 2001 Games have better graphics. But I don't care about that. Meh.Final Verdict, for Imperial Glory is a 3/10. Awful game. But, still can be fun I guess			"

												I can't believe I bought this worthless game.  At least I bought it on sale.  Won the battle of waterloo as the french easily.  Then played the grand campaign and waited for my besieging army to take the territory for a few turns until I ran out of patience and quit.  I'm probably going to uninstall this game as soon as I'm done writing this.  If you want a game about Napoleon get Napoleon: Total War instead and steer clear from this.			"

Its the same exact thing, but Napoleon is a lot newer so it has a better engine, better polish, better AI, better graphics and sounds, a more intutitive UI, and is all around a lot funner. This doesn't have anything Napoleon does not have. Its a discount Napoleon Total War.			"

The game has a multiplayer mode as well as a single player mode. Both modes are fun, although multiplayer is a little tough. The game is a bit like Risk. The quests and the tech tree feature make things interesting.You can also choose to make war or peace with the various nations. Beware, some nations will declare war on you! You must go on the offensive, or the defensive. Battles can be automated or you can command them yourself, which is neat. I give this game a solid 8/10!			"

The game also has ways to improve relations with other countries, but this never works, and in the event that you can improve your relations with another country, they want way too much money. At one point (in 1800) I offered $23,000 to Austria to improve relations and they turned it down. Seriously? But still, it's got replayability and I got it on sale for 49 cents.

I'm still playing it and its value hasn't decreased. Both online and as a game played by me , that's a good summary to the games excellence. The game is a very in depth turn based with large responsibilities developing as the game 'thickens'. Anybody who played shogun and medieval on total war should love this game as it is similar with an extra, easy to understand layer of control that vastly enhances the game play realism, above and beyond the likes of all total wars from Shogun (1), all the way through to Rome II.Battle play was also superior to all other games played of this age and price **WITH AMAZING NAVAL BATTLES**.

												I'm so very sad that the bugs that plagued the original PC disk version of this game havn't been sorted before it was put up on steam. If you've played the game before you'll know them - after a particularly complete victory - the load screen won't finish, and the game will crash.I had a lot of fun with the original game until this problem got worse as the game progressed, and I was more or less driven off. I love this game for so many different aspects of its design, mostly the simplicity as I think its a good intro to this type of game - but especially its naval combat as I used to love being a single ship and taking on a fleet, running rings round them.Its a lot of fun, but these issues need sorted.I suppose at 80p I can't really grumble.

												Do you like Strategy War Games? If you answered yes well buy this game. You have to get troops in the beggining and you get a medium variety but all have their perks and weaknesses. You have to control your men to wipe this army out of the Imperial Glory Histoic Battles. If your not winning then they are, If you do not crush them they will show no mercy. You have to think were am I going to put this group of fighters? I will tell you where out in to a good strategic position or the enemy will have the upper hand. This is a very good strategy game I recomend this to you fair gamers.			"

												Bought this game during a sale so for me it was only €1 but I can think of at least hundred other €1 games out there that WORK on a computer that was made after the year 1800, It started up fine but after my first battle it crashed so I tried again, and again, and again and then I gave up, of course i could play with the AI running the fighting side of things but there are two problems with that, One the AI is terrible and will lose a battle ON EASY with the enemy consisting of 1 melee unit and mine consisting of three musketeer units (this actually happened when I was playing around with the game) and two, the only reason anyone would buy this is because of the battles! Even if it worked the game is pretty unrealistic when it comes to diplomacy, the fact that you dont knowledge of all the countries in europe is even stupider and the technology side of things makes no sense.

												I can't remember if I had the original game or not, but decided to get it anyways. This is pretty much Empire Total War lite. The AI isn't particular good. It keeps splitting it forces when attacking and the computer likes give you gold for right of passage which it never used to good effect or declares war on you, but decides to end it the next turn and give you gold. The computer also likes building ships which it never uses usefully. I never had the need to go beyond the basic troops or upgrade any of the basic buildings. My games all played similiarly. Survive the first wave of attacks. Gain territory. Build a strong force. Play the annexation game (Free up nations from majors powers, so freindly nation would come to my side. Repeat with the next major power.  Build a dominate army, take out who ever is left. The game did crash on a regular basis after ending the tactical battles on windows 7 laptop, since my main XP was having problems. Supposedly there are ways around it, but using tactial battles would have made the game way easier.If you do lose a major battle it can have a cascading effect which you might not be able to recover from. So while I didn't find the game particular challenging, there is a risk of failure if you make a major mistake. So for $0.75 and around 45 hours of playtime, I think it was worth it.  "

												Simple and straight forward, it doesn't take too long to properly understand the game and the mechanics. The campaign was a pleasent surprise (I did not expect the campaign to have an empire sim.) and the ""historic battles"" along with the Quick Match making were pretty fun. I have a small complain about your soldier AI (not always responding to commands), but that was a minor problem which doesn't really  take away from the experience. Enemy AI is good and can somtimes prove to be really hard to destroy. Graphics were surprisingly good for 2005, and they run smoothly.Overall 8/10...Everything is good, yet some AI and map improvments would be nice, and some more historical battles.			"

												This game combines country management with RTS gameplay! I bought this damn thing for .79 cents and I have 130 hours on it! It requires careful strategies both in battle and out, and I think it is really cool how they have an AI controlling the independant countries other than the 5 empires. In battle on easy mode, even if you are the attacker, the AI will ALWAYS attack you. It can glitch out sometimes and do dumb stuff within the battle. The lack of moral for units in battle is kinda cheap, as you can literally command units to death. But it is pretty smart when it comes to managing the other countires aganst you, and will not hesitate to attack your weaknesses. Yeah its a bit dated (2005) but it is a lot of fun for a stategy junkie like me! Highly reccomend!			"

												Great fun! The only reason I originally brought it was because I had some money left over in my account and I felt like a new cheap game. I wasn't expecting much from a £3.99 game from 2005, oh how wrong was I!    You have great control over your troops while in battle, incrediably easy to pick up the controls and the campaign is great fun! Even if you don't play it as much as I have. Playing the campaign will easily fill up your afternoon.    You can't really make a list of the bad points because of the age of the game. I really do think it would be amazing if a big games company would possibly make another game in the series. It would be good if they would need to include; more empires, improved graphics (obviously), more control over your nation, better interaction with AI, improved multiplayer, large map (whole world), improved dynasty, cities?, more detailed over-view map, colonization, tax etc and even more!    If you have a couple of quid to spare and you enjoy strategy games it's a must!:D			"

												First off the adevertisment of the game is misleading, All the screen shots show is the actual battles which is less than 20% of the game the rest is like a big chess board/risk type thing. Secondly I played the game for 44 minutes started getting into a good war and was fighting my way out of a corner when the game just crashed, Could be my system i dont know, Im runnie an AMD 8120 8core cpu with 8gs of ram and an rp 280x graphix card. I payed like 1.25 for thisz game and wish i could have my money back :-}			"

												Picked it up in a sale for $0.49. Bought this for a substitute for Napoleon:Total War because TW can't run on my system. I must say that I wasn't expecting much, hearing reviews from the Total War forums, but man, I was wrong. This game is FUN. You have to make hard decisions both on/in the map and the battles. It is really hard in the beginning, but once you gain a foothold and some infantry and cavalry, you're good to go. Quick TipsWindows 7/8/8.1 users, if you're running a display above 1024x768 (I think), and you're sent back to your desktop after starting this up, go to config.sb in Imperial Glory's folder and change ""Fullscreen True"" to ""Fullscreen false,"" then set the compatibility mode to Windows XP SP2,  that should fix the problem.Cavalry can destroy your infantry extremely quickly, which until you gain the Square  Formation to repel them, will happen often. Militia is really hard to counter in the beginning with your first Gunpowder infantry, mix your Gunpowder infantry with militia to help you.Use buildings, you can kill an army 2x your size just by being in a garrison.Don't fight wars unless you're certain you can destroy the enemy nation, you'll find yourself in a stalemate even if you have enough troops.USE DIPLOMACY "

												The game crashes (either after battle you direct yourself) or just.. because it wants to as you're looking at the map of Europe. The game also has ways to improve relations with other countries, but this never works, and in the event that you can improve your relations with another country, they want way too much money. At one point (in 1800) I offered $23,000 to Austria to improve relations and they turned it down. Seriously? But still, it's got replayability and I got it on sale for 49 cents. And at that price, it's worth it.			"

												I can't remember if I had the original game or not, but decided to get it anyways. This is pretty much Empire Total War lite. The AI isn't particular good. It keeps splitting it forces when attacking and the computer likes give you gold for right of passage which it never used to good effect or declares war on you, but decides to end it the next turn and give you gold. The computer also likes building ships which it never uses usefully. I never had the need to go beyond the basic troops or upgrade any of the basic buildings. My games all played similiarly. Survive the first wave of attacks. Gain territory. Build a strong force. Play the annexation game (Free up nations from majors powers, so freindly nation would come to my side. Repeat with the next major power.  Build a dominate army, take out who ever is left. The game did crash on a regular basis after ending the tactical battles on windows 7 laptop, since my main XP was having problems. Supposedly there are ways around it, but using tactial battles would have made the game way easier.If you do lose a major battle it can have a cascading effect which you might not be able to recover from. So while I didn't find the game particular challenging, there is a risk of failure if you make a major mistake. So for $0.75 and around 45 hours of playtime, I think it was worth it.  "

												Bought this game during a sale so for me it was only €1 but I can think of at least hundred other €1 games out there that WORK on a computer that was made after the year 1800, It started up fine but after my first battle it crashed so I tried again, and again, and again and then I gave up, of course i could play with the AI running the fighting side of things but there are two problems with that, One the AI is terrible and will lose a battle ON EASY with the enemy consisting of 1 melee unit and mine consisting of three musketeer units (this actually happened when I was playing around with the game) and two, the only reason anyone would buy this is because of the battles! Even if it worked the game is pretty unrealistic when it comes to diplomacy, the fact that you dont knowledge of all the countries in europe is even stupider and the technology side of things makes no sense.
