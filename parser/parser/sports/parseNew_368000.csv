												Wanted to write something longer, but haven't played too much and wanted to keep it the review digestable.I recommend this game with the stipulation that you buy it for $15 or less and enjoy the McElroy's or cheesy humor meant to mimic the style of 80s/90s anime involving mech pilots, as well have having some friends to play with.The gameplay is standard enough (it's golf), only now you're in mechs and can destroy buildings and try to hinder each other from making shots. Controls are mapped well and feel varying between mechs but are a bit cryptic, since they aren't really explained anywhere so it's more trial and error when you first pilot a new one. Special weapons feel nice as well, though, again, they aren't explained too well. Physics might be a bit too floaty, though we do golf on the Moon and under the sea, so I suppose those are the reasons for it.The voicework is well done (in that it's intentionally bad for the purposes of the shows it wants to mimic) and the McElroy's as the announcers deliver some great lines, though I could understand the desire for an off switch since they aren't everyone's favorite. The mech designs look great as well, varying immensely and even offering a giant skeleton and Pierce's mech from Saints Row (apparently someone at Volition was friends with the people at No Goblin.)If this is on sale and you want a golfing game to play with friends locally (or online, though I haven't tested the servers), give it a go. The game is what it set out to be: wacky, chaotic, and campy.			"

												When beverage magnate Arnold Palmer first invented golf well over a year ago, he didn't dare dream that the sport could be elevated to these heights.			"

												Have you ever found the normal golf games to bland? Boring? Lacking mayhem and destruction, on a scale only giant robots could succeed? Look no further, you have found the golf game for you!			"

												It's a game where you play golf in giant robots. It's as absurd as you think it is.The controls take a lot of getting used to, especially since different robots have different control schemes, but once you do figure out how each robot plays, and how the odd physics in several locations works, you'll have a pretty good time with it.Definitely the kind of game to kick back with buddies and mess around with.

												A fun and surprisingly frantic party game with a full group, especially if you have that one friend who won't stop shoving his robot right in the path of everybody else's drives.  *Double especially* if he forgets that you have a Party Ball ready.Make sure to turn on subtitles so you can read the McElroy brothers roasting you and your competition if you're all chatting away on Discord or steamchat or something.  The internet comedy trio really elevate the proceedings, like if Duncan Fisher was sharing the mic with his theoretical two older brothers and they aren't afraid to pick on him, and then pick on you, and then lament the fact that they're all trapped in a digital post-robopocalypse purgatory of golf commentary and miss their dead non-sibling loved ones very much.  That is, if Duncan Fisher had brothers, and was also a Forbes 30 under 30 media luminary.I expect exactly four people out there browsing the Steam review page for this game to know who Duncan Fisher is.

												Edit 3: While still a joke game; I'm quite impressed that most all of the issues I addressed were fixed within a day thanks to the help of the devs.  While players can still interfere with others menus, that's a minor issue compared to the other ones (making eaochter fly, messing with eachothers balls, etc)Edit 2: Currently working with Dev to troubleshoot the issues I had, I do love when a developer is committed to their product like this, much preferable to the typical ""sucks to be you"", so in terms of Customer Service, these guys are already pretty high in my book.Edit: To preface any ""durr, this game isn't meant to be serious"" comments; I know, I'm not judging it for not being serious, I'm judging it for being functionally broken to the point of unplayable multiplayer.  And considering this *fact* the game is, in my opinion, terribly overpriced until this issue is resolved. (emphasis on ""until this issue is resolved""; should it, and other bugs, be fixed, I could see this being a $10 party game on XBLA/PSN easily, more replayability than ""Deadliest Warrior - The Game"" afterall. xD)Review:Another joke game...I don't mind jokes, but jokes that are poorly made I do.  It shouldn't be in the situation where, when playing split screen play, one characters robot is too fat with the camera too close to see anything, another player can't seem to turn their flight off, a third player finds out one of their jetpack buttons causes all the players to fly, not just theirs, and player four finds out that while most players can body-block the golf balls, this player has them just clip right on through.So from a technical standpoint, the game is totally broken beyond reasonable repair.  Maybe grab it between 80%-90% off, but this game is by no means worth $20, let alone the $15 I grabbed it for.  Refunded and uninstalled.Doesn't help that one player opens their menu to check controls, another player presses ""A"" to tea-off, and it caused the whole game to reset either.What's good about the game?The robot designs are nice, the commentator humor is amusing, and the fact that the robots each tea-off in their own unique ways (half the time) is also pretty interesting and fun, too bad some are much harder to than others.  Example, one brings up three spinners, stop all three of them at the right time to get your accuracy rating, another has the old hot-shots-golf styled ""press A once for power, then press again for hook/slice"" ...the other requires you hold the right trigger for 3 seconds then press ""A"" at your own leasire for a 96%-99% accuracy every time. :/			"

												This game is amazing. I played just a little bit of the game by now but it is enough to give me what I want. An arcade golf game. Sure. Is not Hot Shots Golf or Everybody's Golf... but is an indie game. The studio does not count with the budget of a AAA title. Still, the game looks polished and it is really fun.ONE thing that I would love to have implemented on here is the option to have multiple players with only ONE joystick. Passing the control around like in the old Tiger Woods games. That would be an AWESOME implementation. VERY recommended!			"

												I bought it for the McElroys and it's honestly the only redeemable quailty about the game. Pretty boring. Weird mechanics, tad glitchy.			"

												Ignore the try-bads that review this game as a serious Tony Hawk Pro Golfer World Tour 2025. It's a light-hearted game that embraces its comidic nature with over-the-top destruction, ridiculous commentary from the McElroy Brothers, and the ability to just jump in for a game of golf that no other game, not even the famous plumber, can give you within 30 seconds.Complaints? No tutorial or anything. You have to jump in and get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked. Not great. Still, if you can overcome that, you'll find a fun game, and after enjoying Roundabout, No Goblin came out with something silly yet enjoyable that'll not drain your wallet.			"

												It's not a very good golf game. It doesn't bill itself as one, not really, riding on its humor and purposefully bad-to-be-funny voice acting and plot, but the gameplay itself is rather boring and rudimentary. Thirty seven holes feels like it ought to be a lot, yet at the same time there's only four themes for them so it all comes out samey. Probably the biggest point against it is the golf ball physics; the ball feels like it has very little friction, so there are times when all you can do is watch is slowly saunter down a very mild grade and off a cliff. Things are poorly explained, too; the various robot characters have a pool of special abilities and even controlling functions they share, but it'd never actually told. When you hop in a new robot you just have a different way of hitting the ball that you have to intrepret, such as the traditional power meter or revving it up like a car engine.If you want to play a silly golf game with friends over the internet then I'd recommend the aptly titled Golf With Your Friends way more - the silliness in this game is mostly constrained to the single player campaign, anyway. If you want silly humor go for Roundabout from the same developer, as that's at least a good GAME, too.			"

												Quick review since there are noneIt's meh. Animations are janky at best which leads to it looking like someone just used default developer controls. Tried the campaign briefly but was greeted with a camera to the ground. Turns out my robot was underneath the map with no solid surface to stand on. Announcer needs to be turned off, no one wants to hear ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one-liners after every stroke (giggity).I like the robot designs though, Project C being my favorite out of the bunch. You even have a skeleton to play as. A massive. ♥♥♥♥ing. Skeleton.Overall, I can't recommend it as it stands. When an update comes around and tackles some of these problems, I'll update my reveiw.
