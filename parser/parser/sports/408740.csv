												Warning: DO NOT BUY!This game doesn't need a complex review, all you need to know is this: nothing matters!As far as I can tell, winning and losing are strictly random and take nothing that you've achieved, chosen or upgraded into consideration. Your stats don't matter, your equipment doesn't matter, your living conditions don't matter, and your choices during the games don't matter.If anything, the developer of this game has a sense of irony, encouraging players to grind and grind and grind for stats, gear, higher ranks, etc, while never achieving anything; just like real pro-gamers! Well played you sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!If you love butting heads against a random number generator or reading sub-par english then this is the game for you!Personally, I'd just recommend getting a pair of dice and screaming ""ODDS"" or ""EVENS"" at every toss...

												Summary: Nice idea, released too early.Pros:- Fairly original concept where you manage either a team or an individual in the world of e-sports- The cartoon-ish graphics is reminiscent of Game Dev Tycoon.Cons:- Very little information, particularly if you don't play Dota2 or CS.  For example, do you know what an AWPer is?  Tough luck, the game will never tell you.- There are tactics and player stats... that have seemingly zero effect on whether you win or lose a game.  It is completely random to the point where this may as well be a clicker game.- You can join a team but you'll never be picked (at least, I wasn't in the 3 hours I played) "

												At first I thought the game was similar to the Game Dev Tycoon, but I was VERY wrong. It follows the same art style, but that's where it all ends.- The game has NO TUTORIAL. Which means from the very first minutes of gameplay you have to figure out everything through trial and error.- No GLOSSARY OF TERMS. I like to play Dota2 on occasion and I haven't the slightest inclination to ever play a MOBA for anyhting but fun. I'm not interested in ranked stuff AT ALL. Thus, I hardly no any of the terminology that most active players know and use.- The game determines victory by coin toss. The stats and grinding in this game are pointless it doesn't affect the outcome AT ALL. This means that all the stuff you buy and learn are 100% useless.All in all, the concept is great but the execution is crap.			"

												As much as it has improved since release...1st - The English is still really, really poor; I cannot take a game like this seriously with that in mind - surely someone could have fixed the English in the game? For free, even? Like: HOW is it still so bad?2nd - It is still far too ""game-y"" and gimmick-y for my taste, lacking in meaningful and actual Business and Sports Management mechanics... Like: HOW is something as simple as the Email system still just you getting random messages (many of them nonsensical and without context) every now and then - and not an actual Email system, with an Inbox, Sent, Saved and Deleted messages, which you use to do business? Or ones which you receive and then have some kind of choice to make? Like: You get random messages about new gaming gear - yet there are no game mechanics for buying them. You get random messages about friend requests and comments from other players - yet there are no game mechanics for interacting with them.3rd - The game is still far too vague and unclear in terms of how things work and what is and isn't important. Then, keep in mind how few choices you have...  In very early versions of the game, you had random choices to make while playing each Match -  the problem was that you had no clue what those choices did/were they good or bad. Instead of fixing that, they removed this mechanic entirely, thus removing the only mechanic which made actually grinding matches fun, interesting, interactive and engaging...-------------------------------------------------------------There are loads of other miscellaneous issues that just make the game experience feel sub-par:Why are the Champions in the MOBA version of the game so rigid in terms of Type? There should be more Types per Role.Why is the Pick Order always the same?Why is there no ""Patching"" mechanic, instead of the Champion Tier List randomly changing from time to time, alongside your actual Skills increasing or decreasing (!) due to ""changes to items and mechanics in a new Patch""?Why is there only one map in the FPS version of the game and no map-banning/selecting phase?

TL;DR Released from Early Access way too early. Features and mechanics are not fleshed out, game decisions rarely matter and seem completely random, probably due to lack of any type of visual feedback which is crucial in this type of game. Great idea, but poor execution.The Idea of the game is pretty solid. The game is split into two parts, the first you get to take control of an amatuer gamer and turn them into a pro either at FOBA (the game's version of MOBA) or FPS. The second part involves leaving your old life behind and managing a team instead.I'm gonna break down into pro's and con's for easier reading :-Pro's Very unique idea Turn-Based, the game uses an energy system that allows you to make a number of actions each day. (Can be seen as a con too, but I prefer turn-based for this type of game) Ability to stream to make money Runs on most toastersCon's Lack of feedback from most aspects of the game. This is the biggest problem with the game that has been mentioned countless times to the devs but yet nothing has been done about it. Too random. This is somewhat tied in with the point above but outcomes of matches/tournements seem totally random, even if a similar strategy is used. This makes the game extremely tedious as you have no idea why the outcome is how it is. Stats, research, champ choices in FOBA and weapon choices in FPS don't seem to matter. While they did add some features that the community asked for, they didn't flesh out most of it out and it just feels tacked on. Gear is a great example of this, all this does is give you a passive stat once you reach certain conditions (basically achievements). Could have easily have made a PC shop that gave us the choice on what parts to purchase to increase certain stats or what not. Moving into new, more expensive houses, have zero benefit whatsoever.The game came out of Early Access WAY too early. Unless you want a very casual, randomized clicker I would stay clear of this game until they flesh it out properly.UpdateSo it has been nearly a month since release and the game is still in Build 175, I'd just like to point out that this was the lastest build back in the 19th of April, a week prior to release. The fact that we had no new build on release, no patches whatsoever post-release and no sign of the devs in response to any of the feedback since then, leads me to believe this game will no longer be supported. :(			"

Early Access Review
								Meh out of 10!This isn't a bad game and has the ability to be a really great and fun game. My main criticisms at the moment are that stats don't play that high of a role in the game. You winning a match is purely random. There are also times during a match you'll be asked do you want to attack the objective or help your team. At no time does it say if that was a good or bad move. It's not that it needs to state if it was a good or bad move, but there should be something like you helped your team fend off the attacker or the attacker killed you but your team mate killed them or the attacker killed everyone and destroyed the tower. The problem is just that there is not a lot of feedback of what you do right and what you do wrong.			"

								Not bad for an early access but still could use a lot more work. For example, I would like to have -List-1. Name your own peron *A must*2. Chose where he/she lives *A must*3. Chose my own role from the start * A must*4. Chose my own team name * A must*5. A way to train the people I recruit to my team *A must*6. Chose my own team brand *would be nice to have*7. A way I can steam while I am on a team *would be nice to have*8. More detail about which person I should put as a shot caller *would be nice*9. Chose to name people that join my team *would be nice*10. A way to chance out champions that I have mastered. * A must*11. A patch note up date that could tell me which champions my team should be working on. *This would add a new layer in the game*These are just to name a few thing that could vastly improve the game.

Early Access Review
								At this stage, PGM just can't be recommended. I honestly think it was released to Early Access too early.The core concept: A single gamer growing through the rankings, creating a team and eventually winning at the highest level is a fun idea... But everything beyond that seems to be mired in bad design choices.I know, that sounds unfair... but let's examine the first few minutes of gameplay.Alright, I've started a game. Oh, hey, my player has been randomly generated. Name, appearance and nationality. Well, that's okay. At least I got a name I can pronounce. Okay, so we play FOBA? We FOBA player now.Huh, this pick/ban phase is a little strange. There are three bans between two teams, and the layout makes it impossible to ban out AD champions. Huh. I guess that'll make more sense later on, when I start running the pick/ban phase myself.Wow, these champions look a bit silly. Still, that's understandable, it'd take far too much effort to come up with a ton of unique champions. Hell, they're probably randomised too. Everything else seems to be so far.Alright, I lost the game. It's okay, everyone loses their first game. Especially when they have to play support. But still, I'd like to know more about those champions...Wait, where's the champion info page?I think you can see where this is going... And it doesn't get any better. Nothing about FOBA is explained. All I can assume is that we're supposed to guess at how the game it played based on our pre-existing knowledge of MOBAs. Which is reasonable for a player like me, right?What, for instance, is the difference between a Chaser and an Initiator, or a Soaker and a Protector? What do these choices do to alter the game? NOTHING is explained about the results of your games, either in the soloqueue stage or in the later team stages.Ah. The team stages. Okay, bear with me, this is gonna get a bit meta.Pro Gamer Manager is realistic.No, really. In PGM, during what I'll call the 'bedroom' stage, you can choose to NOT play FOBA, and instead play one of three alternate games for stream potential. (FPS, Troll and Minecraft respectively). This will award you quite impressive amounts of money from your fans.You don't get money from streaming FOBA. Apparently MOBA players are stingy.And the best part? You can rack up way over a thousand credits in a single day while streaming, whereas you get virtually nothing from participating in the team stages... Hell, setting up advertising revenue or an eshop can result in tiny amounts of money.So an HOUR of streaming can net you 300 credits with 500 fans via donations and subscriptions... But a shop where you can buy stuff with that same money, and have it go to the same place? That generates 100 credits a WEEK with a thousand fans. And this is at the stage where you can no longer stream for some bizzare, non-existant reason, thus cutting off your only reliable source of credits!The funny thing is, that sounds realistic. A lot of the popular streamers (IE: The ones making the serious bank) AREN'T esports professionals.So... The moral of Pro Gamer Manager is... Don't be a Pro Gamer? Just stream. Then you won't go bankrupt.This game needs so much redesigning is a little bit sad. Here's hoping Early Access works. I'd quite like a good game based around this concept.			"

												I realized i didnt go too deep into manager mode but its not worth my energy on this crappy game bottom line is dont buy this game and buy Game Dev Tycoon Instead its a much more satisfying game to play.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Short Version-Nothing feels like progresss-Practically nothing to research makes me feel like im never making real progress-pointless and random events that dont effect gameplay-Overall score dosent mean anything in 1v1 duels sometimes-Money is really only used for paying monthly expenses and pointless boosts-No Trading Cards -No Achivements-No tutorial is just plain laziness and a tutorial really is needed for a game with so many stats to put points into.-Everything is decided by  random number generator instead of a result of your decisions or skills_______________________________________________When i bought this game i thought it was going to be similair to a game called Game Dev Tycoon because of the look of te core gameplay. This was only kinda true. The first big problem with this game is the lack of things to actually unlock through research. In game dev tycoon you not only had over 100 game genre's to unlock and playwith but also Marketing strategies , game engines , graphics , physics engines multiplayer and much more features to add to your game. In Pro game manager there were very few things to actually research. in career mode i think i research like two things before getting the option to switch to career mode. In career mode theres like only 4 or 5 things there too except they make the prices to get them ridciolous when it dosent feel like they actually do much.My next issue with the game is its random events and popups. 2 in particular i remember is Injuring my hand so my reflexes were damaged and a new headset that came out. You cannot use your money to buy new equipment so why bother telling me about a ♥♥♥♥ing headset that dosent exist for me to buy? I honestly think the whole reflexes thing is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t too cause i never see a difference even when they game says they are improved. When you had popups like that in game dev tycoon it was the result of your decisions. for example one decision is To release your old game engines to the public or to sell them. is you sell it you make money but lose fans if you give it away you gain fans. its that ♥♥♥♥ing simple and it makes game dev tycoon much better than this garbage. Next is THERE IS NO TUTORIAL? WHYYYYYYYYYYY. it makes no sense to not have a tutorial its jsut plain lazy. I have no idea what stats are good for what freaking role because it has no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial. Game dev tycoon has a great tutorial it tells you how to mkae reports to figure out what people care about more in which game genres and which game platforms do better with certain genres. Theres too many things to put your stats into to not have a tutorial. You just have to guess untll you start doing better in games.Money is also pointless in this game. You have nothing to spend it on except for upgrades that dont really do anything or feel like they are worth it. Buying a house is pointless all it does is increase your monthly expensese like wtf is the point of that? It dosent help you dosent add anything theres no point at all nothing beneficial of buying a better house. Even in the Manager mode everythings feels like a waste of time. i see my fans go up but your fans going up dont impact anything except money which besdies needing it for paying your players wages. In Game dev tycoon when you got more popular you got invited to interviews and even to E3 eventually. Something like that would make my fans seem they are better than just me getting more money. With these things in mind in general i just never feel like im making progress in my 6 hours of playing. i see numbers go up and sometimes i win sometime i dont.  Even when you win championships you just get money its really lackluster to see nothing come out of my effort. In Game dev tycoon when you get popular you get newspaper articles magaznine articles , interviews and E3 showcasings and all that feels like progression because its a gradual rise to beign a big game developer. in This game everything feels the same nothing feels like the next level. No achievements , No trading cards they just dont give a ♥♥♥♥.			"

Early Access Review
								This game suffers from the same issue Game Dev Tycoon does: lack of meaningful feedback.Sure, I feel like i MAY be making meaningful decisions, but in the end they all are just random guesses, as the game does not let you know HOW you decisions affect anything at all. It just becomes a game of random rock paper scissors, where you don't even know what the opponent threw. Unless they fix this issues, this game is a huge miss			"

												Hello, this is my first serious review.I'm an avid gamer and dedicate most of my free time to gaming and checking out titles that could be cool and fun.Pro Gamer Manager did have an appeal at the start... same Game Dev Tycoon art... managing your own eSports team... so I figured the mechanics would be similar, thus, making it a fun and entertaining experience. I was wrong.I can see the devs tried to make an entertaining title, but the formula does not work. In MANAGING GAMES you want to see that the decisions and actions you take, affect the outcome of the matches whether in a good or bad way. But when you play Pro Gamer Manager, the decisions you make, affect the outcomes in a really vague way or they don't affect it in any way and are unable to change its outcome. You never know or are told (at least give us a hint of how the mechanics work for god's sake) how things are going to affect your results. You can pickup styles and different tactics but they are really vague on how you should use them and really basic. They try to make it simple but making it that way just takes away the whole experience of being a Professional eSports team.Even if the devs assume you're used and knowledged about MOBA or FPS games, it's difficult to figure out what to do in every situation, even with Trial and Error. I might be wrong if I say that the decisions you take as a manager or a player DO NOT affect the outcome BUT; when I played Pro Gamer Manager I always felt that way and, believe me, IT IS NOT A PLEASANT FEELING.I really tried to find something redeeming and have fun with Pro Gamer Manager, but either I haven't tried hard enough (prob not) or the game in itself isn't fun, probably the latter.It also has some bugs that are not gamebreaking or really important, but they are really simple and basic bugs that kind of break the experience too (16-15 as a valid victory result on a FPS match even if it's not meant to be CS, can't click too fast on incoming messages or they will delete themselves).Pro Gamer Manager defeats its own purpose as a game and a managing game, such potential wasted because of a bad execution.I wouldn't recommend to buy this game in its current state, it's basically not fun for me and I've requested a refund.

Pro Gamer Manager attempts to simulate the experience of, well, being a pro gamer. Watch streams, hone your skills, ascend the ranks, join a team, get a sponsor, and be the best gamer you can be. That's the idea, anyway: the game doesn't quite work out like that.

In Pro Game Manager, you’re given the option to play through one of two careers: Gamer and Manager. You are locked into whatever you choose and can’t experience another path unless you start a whole new game.Choosing either does nothing to change the storyline, as there isn't one, or the core gameplay mechanics, but it does affect the tasks you can undertake in game.From there, you can choose from one of two games: MOBA and FPS. The former is called ‘Foba’ for whatever reason, though I’m pretty sure the genre isn’t copyrighted. Nomenclature aside, your game type won’t significantly change gameplay: in fact, none decisions you seem to really affect anything, I’ve found.Upon starting as game, you are thrown into a room which, though nicely illustrated with simple but colorful components offer you no explanation as to how to proceed. Right clicking brings up a menu with possible actions, but it’s a matter of trial and effort to figure out just how each will affect you or, if you’re a manager, your team.As a gamer, you have the option to…Play Ranked: You choose how you want to build your player for the match and wait for the timer to count down to find out if you win or lose.Watch Stream: Raise knowledge by watching streams. I found that after a point (and without explanation) watching streams did nothing for me.Go to Bed: Rest until the next day. The energy bar is the more managerial thing you'll be doing that actually makes sense and has cause and effect.Research: Use EP to specialize your playstyleProfile: Allocate points to skills you want to strengthen. There's no telling what these skills actually do, so allocate at will.Gear: Use money to buy computer gear to play better and make more fans.Career: See your rank and how you stack up next to other players.House: Use money to buy a house once you’ve accumulated enough, which will allow you to have more team options.. When you start, you live with your parents.e-Sport Central: Attempt to raise your rank.Stream: Stream your gaming sessions to gain fans. This is not immediately available.Managing a team is slightly more involved in terms of matches due to the fact that you can click between three play styles - defensive, balanced, and offensive - but much like everything else, there’s not enough feedback to be able to tell how much this is affecting your chances of winning. I won't list the options available simply because they don't seem to correlate.That aside, there’s not much else to do in Pro Gamer Manager. Every action boils down to watching a timer tick down and that swiftly becomes tedious.The art style is simple and clean and works well. It would have been nice if there had been more than static images.The music consists of one looping track that swiftly becomes maddening when coupled with watching the timer circle fill..Pro & Cons.+As someone who’s played MOBAs, it was mildly interesting to pick from the list of available champions and specialize in a position.+Somewhat accurate representation of the tug-of-war struggle climbing the ranks can be.-Inflexible class, career, and game selection. If you want to try anything other than what you first picked, you'll have to start an entirely different game.-No tool tips or explanations of how stats function: Numbers and actions don’t feel like they have any weight. Stats and decisions don't seem to make any difference in a RNG dominated universe.-Gameplay oversimplified to a series of timers.-No explanations. Ever. If you aren’t already familiar with the two game types available, you’ll be lost.-No reward for experimenting characters approaches. Once you find what works, do it over and over again. ""What works"" is often stumbled upon by accident and doesn't seem to correspond with stats or gameplay decisions.-Lack of immersion due to the issues listed above..Bottom line.Pro Gamer Manager is a good idea that was poorly executed. It would take one small change to change this negative recommendation: if stats and decisions seemed to make a difference or even if battle outcomes were decided by a dice roll or rock-paper-scissors, this would feel more like a simulation game and less like a waiting game.If this review helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

												The game has potential if they give it some meat rather than leave it in it's current state as some RNG, souless shell disguised as a strategy management game.I read the reviews and most advised me not to buy this game.I ignored that advice and while I don't regret buying the game, I totally understand why it's pretty much a waste of time.In it's current state, you may as well roll a dice for everything. Most of your leveling up, honing of ingame skills and upgrades seem to have extremely little to no effect on anything.Fix this and this game will go from a C+ to a B+.The only reason why I don't regret buying the game is because I have a smidge of hope that the developers will update the mechanics of this game to actually mean something. I cannot recommend it as is, however, by lacking any of the things we were expecting, it does show us that with the right things added, this could be a great little indie game.a			"

												Career:This game feels like it is rolling dice for everything you do. The two games you can go pro in are team based, yet it only gives you ""real"" feedback on your player. Otherwise it lists the top players of the game. It literally tells you nothing about your teammates. The tournaments are absolutely random, my 95 star character (I assume this is the skill based system through which the game tells you your and other player's skill) would consistently lose to ~30-35 star players. When computers played, the biggest upset margin I saw was like 3 or 4 stars. The game couldn't care less about your skills in Playstyle, Focus, and Knowledge as I saw no improvement in the amount of games I won while upgrading them. I would literally have games back to back where my character would have a 10 KD ratio and another game with 25 deaths and no kills. It feels like the developers didn't add anything that bases your wins off your pro gamer's skill.0/10 would not recommend. Just go play League or CSGO.			"

Early Access Review
								This game definitely has a ton of potential ! I would highly recommend and will edit as soon as changes are made since i can easily see how this could be incredibly fun , but for now , ill have to say this is pretty meh , and limit frustrating since each time you discover a part of the game or something you like , the game becomes somewhat unclear as to what you're doing wrong and what you're doing right , most of the time when i get good comments in game i will then lose all my games , and when all i hear about are other teams or player , it will feel like i was just underated. higher overall players on your team doesn't seem to do much when it comes to winning ( i won everygame with 4 x 50 overall members on my team , then upgraded to 4 new better players and started losing ). Also sometimes it feels like whatever strategy you're using has no impact on the way games go. Early in the game there is a development phase for your main character which seems like it didn't even matter later in the game. The easiest way to make money in this game is in the first half which is kinda weird since i dont think streaming the game should pay more than having an actual pro team ! A lot of minor bugs are also present which is understandable due to the very early stage of this game ( for example I was number one on the solo queue ladder and when i looked up at bjergsenx it would also tell me he is number one ). Most of the menus dont have back buttons which means you have to make decisions that can't be changed  after you change screen. The overall for other characters than yourself also dont seem to change which is sad when you spend time training and stuff. I will definitely be back to try this game in a while to see if it was fixed since I had fun , but otherwise this is pretty much unplayable. Hope to see you guys push the great ideas you had further and do some epic polishing on this amazing project of yours ! SincerelyJust a Hobo			"

												Been playing it since it first came to early acess. If the game keeps getting developed then i would say get it if you enjoy manegment games. In its current stated it is definetly unfinished. Many things that were promised were never delivered, but its still decent once you get past that it feels like the hole game is a RNG (which it very well may be). In addition there is no clear guidance as to what does what or what stats might effect what things.... All in all i am disapoionted that they rushed the realese and will still keep following it, but without more work its not as much a game as it is a beta/alpha with a great concept.			"

												Explaining the situation:Currently, Pro Gamer Manager is under redevelopment after 501 Industries took over development of the game. A relaunch is planned and already from news and snippets of information we've been given by the devs, the FPS mode has already been given a brand-spanking new look and is already looking and sounding 100x better than the original mode. Even when this game was very bland and purely based on randomness, I enjoyed it as a game to have on the side while doing work or watching a stream. It's very handy if you dont have alot of time but want to have a little fun too!All in all, I dont believe all these negative reviews tell the truth about this small game and I suggest you wait a few weeks/a month or so before buying it to see how these new devs take up the mantle! :D			"

Early Access Review
								So I won a copy of this game on Letigress' stream. My understanding is that she (the streamer) had teamed up with the developers to promote the game. Which was pretty cool.So I played the copy I won for a couple hours. Is it interesting? Heck yeah! Is it fun? Well, depends on what you're lookng for. Right now it kind of plays like an idle game that you can't be idle for. You start a game or start watching a pro to increase stats, and just wait. Then the growth doesn't seem to have a huge impact on your playing. And things seem very vague right now. Champions don't have names, just graphics. You don't do the draft, just make some broad strategical calls, and the computer takes over.Do I think you should buy this game? Sure. It is worth $10 in my opinion, if you have money to try out small indie games. If you're looking for 20 hours of content, this game is NOT for you. It could be eventually, but it needs more development.I want:Champion namesAbility to draftMore customization of my characterClear growth in character with all the statsMore options than just play or watchA more interesting early gameAbility to get in game money and customize roomMore depth! Right now this feels generic at timesGreat idea, guys! Keep at the game. It could be special. :)			"

Raptor Claw lied to the community to keep their sales coming in promising so many things and then completely abandoned the game.They then gave or sold it to 501 who is now attempting to sell a broken game with DLC.

												It had huge potencial, but it went WAY too early out of Early Access and dropped like 80% of what they've promised to include in later iterations.In its current state, it is indeed a terrible game, pure grinding which is based on pure randomness. Even though you put many hours into grinding you up, it still feels like you have literally no impact on the results, therefore its a waste of time to put hours and hours into the game.I really tried to like this game, it is really sad that they decided to abandon all the good ideas and left it in this very poor state. *sadface*			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, I, giving a positive to keep balance flow, altough I agree with some fact from negative reviews.Pro Gamer Manager have potentional to be favorite casual game, if it gets proper polishing and finishing touches.One of the reasons Im giving it temporary positive is that developers looks very friendly with community, ready to listen any suggestion or proposal, so Im pretty sure they will do a great thing with this game.Just an idea that you play as pro gamer is epic! It looks like a Game Dev Tycoon, but its so much more...At this time  pro's and con's arent much of a use, since game is clearly not finished, Il point some out and some of my playing.I will mark it as spoiler so think twice before you read it :)Pro's+ Original idea and great refreshemnt in casual gaming+ Big potential to be very addicting gameCon's ( at this time)- Bad battle system- Lack of events- After moving in to gaming room you loose track of your skills and ability progression- You cant see details of enemy team (players and their skills)- First part of the game jumps out from the second  At this time battles looks like they are win/lose randomly. Are you sure? Yes! after 4 hours of playing, I used cheat to boost my stats and hire best players in the world, and you cant beat  amateur teams, yes I also played 6  constant seasons to have high team harmony, and yes you cant progress in to the next league. Suggestions to developers:+ A character creation (at least name, age and nationality is a MUST)+ More controls managing your abilities and skills+ Practicing matches ?+ More random rewarding eventsI do hope it will get it's full potentional, and I will fu**ing love this game.

												Played it until about Day 60 or so. I was a big fan of Game Dev Tycoon and this seemed very similar to it so I thought I'd give it a go. The biggest hangup I have with this game is that no matter what, nothing you do seems to have any affect on the outcome of the battle (I only played FPS player and not manager). After I unlocked streaming and got it up to about level 10, all options of genres to stream vanished except for FOBA and FPS.I bought both upgrades for the houses and they did absolutely nothing. I thought you'd get some better hardware or it would be easier to stay in high spirits and get benefits to gaming, anything really but no, nothing. I can't seem to get passed star level 95. I don't know if that's working as intended but you go into the league tournaments and you'll often get beaten by guys that are half of that of your level. You can upgrade your hardware but the last one you need platinum gaming status and it seems pretty damn hard to achieve. Simply for the reason that you can win 1 map and then lose 10 in a row no matter what you do. You have a rage bar that fills up whenever you lose a ranked match but I have had it up to full and down to nothing and I honestly can say that I see no difference in the outcome battles with this either.It is certainly in need of some tutorials. I see other people say that there is a not of Counter Strike terminology in here and never having played it, I had to look up some of what they're talking about to get an understanding of what skill is supposed to do what. I think if they ironed out the few bugs that existed and made things less random or maybe give some kind of explanation as to what is doing what, it could turn out to be a really fun game. In its current state though, I can't recommend it.			"

												Lots of people have given lists of Pro's and Con's so I'll skip that side of things and keep it simple.I bought this game around 6 months ago when I heard about it and it was difficult to play but I seen it had a ton of potential so I was happy to wait for release, sadly it seems either the developers didn't have the time and money or the skill to realize this game's potential.The main issue with this game is a total lack of player feedback, you make tactical choices before each match but the game doesn't tell you what you did right and what you did wrong, you have a ton of stats but the game doesn't tell you what each stat does, there are a ton of heroes to play in the MOBA mode but there is almost no information about the heroes, just a basic thumbnail, whether they are a support, ADC, Jungler and whatever and whether they are Utility, Healer, Burst and such but no other information at all.If this game gave some worthwhile feedback to the player and went a little more in depth with the heroes instead of just a name, thumbnail and the bare basic info then I could see it being really good, but unless that happens.. it's not worth buying at all.Hopefully a developer with more experience takes the idea of this game and makes something better because a game about being a manager of a Pro gaming house and/or being a professional gamer could be awesome, sadly.. this game isn't.TL;DR version: No depth, no player feedback, no skill involved, just RNG, not worth buying.

												ok, ive fed a good few hours into this so I'm pretty clear on what im talking about. Its pretty clear that there is little to no impact of skills and weapon familiarity on ranked games. This appears completely random. There is no feedback whatsoever to give an indication on what tactics to take following a disaster or a flawless win.Your team WILL NOT PLAY YOU despite having three times the fans and skill levels as the team capatain.

												Possibly one of the worst games available on Steam, this turd is laughably bad, even when you strip away the notion that it ""could have been good.""When I first got this game, I thought it was conceptually awesome. I'm a big fan of eSports just as a sport and following the LCS in LoL makes me substantially happier than playing the game. So I was willing to put up with a completely unfinished alpha build of a game.This game is full of placeholders. Almost every graphic, nearly every menu, every instance and event is clearly a placeholder. There is only one animation on the MOBA side of things, a spinning circle that is meaningless. Everything else is just stills and moving from one still to another. That's fine, Game Dev Tycoon is fairly light on animation, though at least in that game the screen does have movement. Everything in this game may as well just be text based because the images lend nothing to the game. I would have given a pass on the placeholders when I first got the game because there were updates almost weekly, and you got a sense that somebody was clearly developing it still. There were comical gaps, sections that were just plain empty, enormous bugs, and spelling errors everywhere (""Silly season is over"" meant to be ""Offseason is over"" or the spelling of ""Okey""). I assumed this thing was being thrown together by a couple guys in Sweden, and so I'll give them benefit of the doubt, they'll get this eventually I'm sure...Well here we are. The product on the MOBA side has released zero updates in over 6 months, and the FPS side, which I never played, is apparently a train wreck that I'm terrified to go near. I know a lot of people are complaining that the newest ""update,"" which was supposed to be the patch to finish the game months ago and was so bad it needed to be immediately rolled back, has been announced as a DLC which will eventually cost money. That is certainly a horrendous and despicable decision, but I don't think reviews should even be upset at that; they should be busy losing their minds that the game is out of Early Access and still is nowhere near even a beta-level of release.Here are some bugs, just on the MOBA side, just off the top of my head:You have a 50/50 chance of a spelling error in any given message.Using the ""Update free agent"" staff member in MOBA Owner mode will cause the menu to no longer be available and erase your B team, not that you have any control over that team or input, and you must quit and reload to fix this.If you rank up in Career mode and are in the top 100 or so, you will over rank and get a ranking like -74.You will get notifications in your inbox but the email will be blank.No matter what league you're in, you won't be able to view the roster of at least one of the teams. It will always show another teams' roster.Players in owner mode can still skill up after hitting 99 and will show having skill points to spend, even though they can't be spent.If multiple players choose not to re-sign with your team on the same day, only one of them will show up in free agency.Let's also remember this: the game is stateless. That's right, a sports simulation game that is stateless, figure that out. There are no divisions above and below you until you move into that division. If you make it to the pro division in MOBA owner mode, you will always see the same teams. If you get relegated then return to the league, you will see those same teams again and players. This is especially fun if you picked up one of the players from one of those teams as now two of them will exist.If you drop a player into free agency, their age, nationality, rank, face avatar, name, and even role can/will change. Players also never age because the game has no general state. How long is a season? I don't know. All you can do is go to the next day and then if you do you can play a new match. After you play every team twice, the season is considered over, top 2 teams get promoted, and then it starts over again. There's no timeline, no real offseason (sometimes it lasts 2 days, sometimes 3, sometimes 4), and no schedule.For fun, here's a list of things you cannot do in, I will remind everyone, a game that is supposed to be a sports simulator:Trade players with other teams.Negotiate contract salaries with free agents.Negotiate contract term length with free agents.Negotiate contract term or salary when re-signing a player.Have more than the exact number of starting players (5).See the different leagues you can/will move between while not in them.Skip simulation of games or simulate an entire season (you must ""play"" every game).You only get one-shot with a free agent; if you accept their offer they may still just sign with another team with no chance for you to make a counter offer.Look at a calendar with all upcoming matches.Participate in play-offs or a championship.That's embarassing. There are plenty more I would put on the list but technically can't. They're listed as being in the game but don't actually do anything. For example, you can set up what the team does in their practice time by just clicking one of three options. It doesn't mean they'll improve in those skills because those aren't skills they can even improve in. You can also select a strategy for your ""meta"" but you can't see them execute the strategy, you don't know your opponent's strategy or style, you have no information on them, and it also has no impact. You can even decide what style each individual player should take up but again, it will not impact the results in any way.When matches are being played, here's what will happen. The game will give each team an overall score based on the five players skill level (1-99). And before you ask, yes every player can just get to 99, nobody caps out, nobody specializes, they just generically reach 99. It will then ""draft"" a team comp, which is you watching with no input on what is picked, not that you would know what any champion does or is because there are no descriptions for them. Pause review: there are no descriptions of anything in the game, nor any tutorials. Zero. After the draft it will tell you some meaingless sentence at the bottom like ""GlassCannon Comp"" or ""HighMobility Comp."" Again, these aren't described, you don't see anything play out, they don't mean anything. Your team won't have mastery over certain comps, so it may as well just say nothing. Then you enter a new screen with just the two teams on either side. You have three options: ""Defensive, Balanced, Offensive"" and guess what, none of them do anything. They aren't related to your comp, or your players' strengths, they don't change anything. All that matters were those numbers at the start. If you get an all 99 team, which you inevitably always will, you will always win every league game, with the odd rare exception to I guess make it look like a random number generator. But that's it.Except the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ international trounaments. I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ happened with these because they're the part that makes me actually vehemetly angry. The rest of the game I shrug and say ""sure it's a piece of crap that doesn't do anything but at least it's numbers sort of make sense, even if arbitrary and meaningless and random. Team of 99s should always win, more or less.""HaI welcome you to hell then. Try an international tournament. Put in your team of all 99s. Guess what? It doesn't mean jack crap. I swear to god they are an intentional joke meant to test your patience. It's like the developers knew they were making a ♥♥♥♥ game that doesn't do anything, but they also knew people would play it, so they wanted to test how far they could push us idiots who go early access on nothing but a concept by creating this wasteland of a game mode. It's completely random and meaningless even if you win.So no, I would never recommend this. It's not a completed game and they're not trying to change that.			"

												Put quite simply, as it is right now Pro Gamer Manager is really bad. Like, absolutely terrible and wouldn't want to spend my money on it had I known how crap it would be kinda bad. To be fair it's an alpha, and that is to be expected.So far I've only played Career mode for FOBA and the game tells you NOTHING. There is no tutorial or any feedback of any kind. Wanna know how each stat afffects your gamer's ability to win? Too bad! Developer says Fk you! Want to know what kind of play style works best against a certain kind of team comp? Too bad! Figure it out for yourself - which I can understand and would be a normal thing in a game like this... if not for how it seems completely random at times. In order to consistently win I had to grind the hell out of my gamer's stats and that was when I was only in Silver, which, by the way, I could not progress out of - not because my gamer was bad(His rating was 84) - but because I ran into a glitch. I could not get to gold and I was in the top 10,000 in the world at one point.My gamer was also on the top team in the league and I was replaced by a complete scrub who had 40 less rating than I did. This was near the end of the season too which made me extremely salty. I didn't even show up on the team's roster, despite still actually being on the team - which makes me think it was another game-breaking glitch. My team went from ""thinking I was a good player"" to completely hating me and wanting to replace me for no reason. I carried their worthless hides on my back for the entire season and they want to replace their star player? Get real.This happened on such consistant basis too- the only fix being leaving the team and finding a new one.So why am I recommending it then? Well despite all of its glaringly obvious flaws, I enjoy the concept of Pro Gamer Manager and can see it has a lot of potential to be really good. It's an alpha people, flaws are to be expected and personally I say support this developer so we can see Pro Gamer Manager as a finished product.			"

Half the time the game plays itself, and when it doesn't you're trying to see what will work WHEN EVERYTHING IS LUCK BASED! And Manager mode, its even more confusing than the Career mode! You're never told anything, and you don't tell us how to make money!Some pros of this game: It gives you lots of choices at the start, letting you learn how to play the game easily. Sadly, this doesn't help the game because EVERYTHING IS LUCK BASED! It's a good idea, but it's not made well that you don't focus on the idea. The time where you choose your personality is great, and if other games (well made games) had this they would be fun. But still: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! THIS IS A TERRIBLE MADE GAME!			"

												Great concept, poor execution.As someone who enjoys management games, this looked like an interesting take on the genre, being that I enjoy MOBA games and the pro scene centered around them. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no substance to the game. Your stats and attributes mean nothing. You can max out your character and still lose to players far worse than you. To make matters worse, there is little to no feed back as to why you lost. Maybe you picked the wrong champ, maybe you picked the wrong playstyle, you'll never really know.To make matters worse, the Devs seem to have abandoned the MOBA side of the game in favor of the FPS side, which I have no interest in, and its not that much better from what I hear.The game is playable, but its all random. Not worth picking up until some major updates are made, and from the looks of things, thats going to be a loooooong ways away.			"

Early Access Review
								To start out, I really like the game concept and would really love to continue playing it in my down time! I found out about this game through Letigress's Stream[www.twitch.tv] and thought I would try it out. Things I Would Like Added Ability to adjust sound levels Create my own character and name Leaderboards across steam friends/global Customizeable/Randomized room because it is identical everywhere More of a background on ""FOBA"", ""greatest game on the planet"" doesnt describe it very well List of champions with stats/common role More of a tutorial about what stats go into what and how they effect your player Counterpart to rage bar, ie. A happiness bar Interactive pick phase  Changing room over time/awards won and placed in room Possibly a multiplayer feature?  Music that changes based on anger or possibly how the game being played is goingThings I Do Not LikeThe bubble popping sound only  comes up in one ear and is quite annoyingBug/Error/Mishap Various times throughout the game there are words that do not have a space, making it look cluttered This[i.gyazo.com] needs to be fixed (""cant stop play it"") First time clicking on a specialty while learning, the ""book"" just disappears and I have to click again for something to happen When you have all the specialties unlocked and try to unlock another, you sit there and cannot get out of it because there is nothing to clickThings I Like Post game quotes from spectators is a nice feature General feel of the game The music is fitting and calmingShould You Get This Game?This would depend on a few things, are you expecting a completed game? Are you expecting a game that has no bugs at all? Do you want to have full control over this game entirely? If you answered yes to any of those questions then I would put this game off to a later date where it is completed.This game would be great if you wanted some relaxation time or a break from your current ""high-action"", ""intense"" game. This game is calming and can be a way to relieve stress while trying to achieve something or maybe even get a feel at what it is like to manage a pro player. This game is in a playable state and there are no fatal bugs that would anger you.ConclusionOverall, this game is looking great for being in early access and I know a lot of what I have said is probably being developed or worked on but it would still look great in the game! I would recommend this game to a casual gamer not looking to get frustrated at a game. It has calming music and resembles some very popular games out there (Dota 2, League of Legends).

UPDATE FOR FULL RELEASEThe game is now out of Early Access. Prematurely, as you'll find out.Many of the points below - written for an early version of the game - still stand.There is little to no feedback, not even to mention explanation. If you are not aware of the terminology in League of Legends or Counter-Strike, you will have a hard time understanding without researching it yourself.The game is a big grind for stats which ultimatively do not seem to matter. The results (winning, losing, stats) seem incredibly random, even if your team is half of the world top 10 players.I had a lot of hope for the game when it was in Early Access. I do think this was released way too early and the premature release hurt the game in the end.If you find this review unhelpful, I invite you to tell me why in the comments. Will do my best to explain my verdict and would happily take feedback.##################################################Original Early Access review below: ##################################################I was thinking about giving this the thumbs up or not. I decided that I should go by what the game is right now, not what it can be, promised to be nor I hope it turns out to be. The game shows a lot of promise but what's in there right now has too little long time motivation for me to recommend it. (the ammount of hours played is a bit skewed in my case as I left the game open for a night and work day).The game assumes you know a lot of terminology of League of Legends (since that is what the game is mainly taylored towards right now) and doesn't explain any of it.I've played a bit of MOBAs but never heard of an ADC in my life, because I haven't played LoL. Friends with multiple hundres (sometimes thousands) of hours of playtime in DOTA 2 and Heroes of the Storm didn't know either.The game generally doesn't explain itself too well right now. There is no tutorial yet and your performance in the game is not explained. You select a role (Top Lane, Mid Lane, Jungler, Support, ADC) and a chamption according to your role. There are types for champions (e.g. Sustain, Healer, Chaser, Utility, Tank, etc) but they are not explained. There are mutliple champions for each type but you are not told what differs Healer 1 from Healer 2, except for the ""Tier"" it is listed in, ranging from ""SS"" as overpowered champions to ""C"" as competetively non-viable champions - though it is not explained why. This tier list changes with patches to the ingame game which is a really nice mechanic in itself.Selecting a hero oddly enough also takes place before champions are banned (in MOBAs you often have the chance to ban a champion for a game so the other team can not use it), so you can take whatever champion you want.A Win or Loss also does not seem to take your stats into account. Of course, a single player seldomly carries a whole team to the win but my almost maxed out stats didn't seem to have any impact on the outcome of the game. You are simply not told what you've done wrong nor right.In order to increase your stats you can watch top players streaming the game, though Pro Gamer Manager doesn't tell you what you're learning. It doesn't tell you what stats increased, if you've learned something about playing a certain champion, etc. Different compositions of a team make up different strategies that range from a ""Glasscannon"", ""FullAD"", ""NoInitiation"", and ""Balanced"" to ""NoDisengage"", ""Early Game"" and others. None of them are explained so the player is expected to know about them, when they are not self-explanatory.After the banning phase (you take no participation in because you already have your hero selected) you chose a focus for Lanephase and Teamfights as well as a general Mentality. No explanation on what does what, as it is expected of the player to know. Your selected champion also has no impact on this, so you'll have the same strats availablle for a Healer as for a Sustainer.Game done, you're rated with a GameScore between 1 (worst) and 10 (best) and can see your Kills, Deaths, and Assists stats. Besides that and telling you if you've won or lost, there is no explanation. You can't watch your own demos in order to examine what went wrong either.The next game you might win, you will still not know what changed the outcome. I'm a fan of ""eSports"" so I've sunken quite some hours into the game and still enjoyed myself. Ultimately, it was just grinding and looking at a circle fill up and percentages increasing, since there is very little going on visually. There are a lots of areas that need a redesign and lots of bugs that need to be squashed. Having your own team doesn't seem to work too well and cuts you off from areas of the game (improving certain heroes, researching, streaming) for some reason. You also will not know what you're getting yourself into before starting a team on your own (which can happen way too early at the moment). Earning money seems a bit imbalanced, since streaming is way too lucrative right now (in fact, more lucrative than being a Pro Gamer).All this is to be expected of a game in Early Access and I do imagine a lot of this (if not all) will see itself being adressed later in development but I can only rate the game for what it is now. The current meta of the game is way too impetuous, as very little is explained.I can't comment on the frequency of updates just yet. However, the lack of feedback is a common theme inside and around the game, since the developers of Pro Gamer Manager could communicate with their current fanbase a lot more. As a player you are pretty much left in the dark about the progress of the game. So far, patches were posted (the last one was around two months ago at the time of writing this) in the News section but you get no progress reports.Updates in the form of blog-like posts would be nice, maybe bi-weekly in order to actually know what they are working on as well as confirming they actually are working on the game. This will give players confidence and increase the amount of recommendations.A beta-branch might even help with bugtesting and getting feedback. The Store page reads:""Pro Gamer Manager is currently under development, but releases regular updates. We are actively working hard on fixing bugs and adding new features and content. Early Access will help us to get feedback and suggestions right away and continuously improve the game until final release. Check back to see what each new update brings[...]Community feedback helps us prioritize our long list of planned features and focus on fixing the worst bugs and issues.  Thank you very much for your valuable ideas and your feedback that we are considering in the future development! We kindly ask you to submit your compliments, questions, criticism, ideas and feedback to this forum""The participation on the forums is fairly one-sided. I haven't seen a comment from a developer yet, outside of Twitter.In the end, I enjoyed playing the game but I wouldn't blindly recommend it to others right now. Hopefully I will be able to in the future but right now, the lack of feedback inside the game as well as the lack of feedback from developers is worrying me, personally.DO BUY the game if you can spare the cash and want to invest in a promising game without any guarantee that it will turn into whatever you imagine. With Early Access, the risk is yours to take. Also buy it if you want to test it, there is no demo and if you play less than two hours, you can get a refund via Steam Support. Make use of this option! Maybe you'll like the game and want to support and fund the game along with the developers.I'll keep this game on my mind and will certainly change this review if I see improvements or feel my (our) feedback has been heard and acted upon.

												After the developer (501) take over this game development, here is something that concern me after recent firefight update:1. Still no influence on the match. We will just watch a pac-man chasing other around for 30 round. not skipable2. the match graphic is worst than before!3. if you click on the fridge and the bathroom, the icon for each activity is not there. you need to guess where is the coke4. BUG! if you winning till the half game (about 15 round), you will lose the other half. Therefore, you will lose the game all the time because of the side-switch-----------------Conclusion-----------------the game is worst than before, no noticeable update. You can't call this ""a finished game"" and charge it for money.to all of you that have yet download this game, better not! save your drive space.Don't buy this game or you'll regret it like i did. sigh			"

												Horrible game. The concept is great and I'm glad that there's such a game of this concept, but I promise this isn't the game.This game is being abandoned and they're making a sequel to an unfinished game. Don't believe me? Look at the Dev Notes. The devs aren't even offering the new game for free to the people that got scammed buying this game.Looking for an actual review?Pros+ Good EffortCons- Horrible developers- Tons of spelling errors that will not be fixed- The lack of skill in this game, as it's all random will not be fixed- horribly scaled images will not be fixedThere isn't much to the game in the first place so I can't make a huge list.

												I really am a sucker for these sorts of management games, so when I saw this game I thought ""Hey, I loved GameDev Tycoon, maybe this will be similar."" I was wrong. This game is plagued with unnecessary wait times to get anything done, a lack of any kind of explaination for game mechanics (Let alone nomanclature used for the actual games), and horrible translation and grammar issues.I played this game both from the solo career side and the management side, and neither of the two options are any fun. In an attempt to stretch out the length of gameplay an arbitrary unskippable timer was included with phrases such as ""Your team won the teamfight!"" and then a random amount of gold would be added to your team's total. This was entertaining or at least tolerable the first few times, but when you get to realize that this is the game, it's like I'd rather sit and watch a loading screen than play this game even a little bit.This game could be so great! If the devs added some options to increase the speed of the gameplay, or to skip the arbitrary timer all together I would be much more inclined to play. The addition of mouse over tool-tips or any kind of explaination of the game's mechanics would also greatly improve the user experience for those players not familiar with the general concept of these sorts of games.In conclusion, both core aspects of the game are flawed for different reasons. The solo career has no explaination at all for what you're doing, and the management portion is more waiting than it is playing. Don't buy the game. Or at least wait until it gets better.			"

When I bought this game, I thought that I would have a magnificent experience, but unfortunately that's not the case. This game doesn't involve skill and everything is decided by random result. You can spend any amount of time in the game and you will go nowhere.

Early Access Review
								So this game has potential. However as it stands, it's quite bad.The whole premise of the start of the game is to build up your character with all these different stats. Around day 20 you go to a gamer house.. Cool right? NO. Not cool at all, everything you have worked for up to this point isn't worth anything at all. Sure it gets you a single higher star rating, but all of the stats involved cease to exist.The game doesn't tell you, but if you don't have tons of cash going into the gamer house, you're boned. Even $5000 is nowhere near enough. Website + Finance Manager + Advertising generates $157 total. Just the finance manger alone is $600/week.The first part is enjoyable, the gamer house is ridiculous. Why master a champion in the first phase, if you can't choose a champion in the gamer house?			"

												What everyone is saying here about getting ripped off is completely accurate. This game didn't work and doesn't work. It plays itself more or less and offers you no feedback on your supposed ""choices"". How can one make an informed choice when there is no information granted to determine what the best course of action is, was, or will be in the future? You can't that's how. This is not a game. You would be as well off rolling a six sided die and guessing which side it will land on. That would be equally a game as this. To imagine they have the nerve to be like ""yeah we're just going to not bother fixing this mess we jumped in on in the middle of production. turns out it's rep is so bad and the code is such a mess that we'd be better off just starting over..... and we need money since this original game already sold to all the suckers available the only thing i can think of is lets try to catch and release and recatch these fish with a sequel"". Maybe the sequel will be good since it's a new dev team from the ground up working on it? Hell maybe so. I hope so cuz this is a cool niche. I'm afraid my good will or gullibility has run out though. Do NOT buy this for 3 dollars. Do the dice rolling thing like I said.			"

I literally have no options to do anything in game but ranked, career and team. You can click on a bed click on a toilet and click on a pc screen. Or am i missing the update? To me they've removed everything that made the original fun. Yes it was random and really made no sense but it had charm. This version i'm just face palming.

Early Access Review
								I can't recommend this game. As much as I want to like it, because I like the idea. But the game basically is just rng slapped on rng, slapped on rng, without any possibility for the player to influence anything. Pro/Cons list at the bottom of the review.You are given the feeling in the beginning that your decisions matter and the more you play, the more you realise that they don't. Not the slightest bit. And even if the game actually considers your choices and bases the rng on it, your choices still don't matter. There is absolutely no feedback why something worked and why something didn't work. If you play the FOBA part of the game or the FPS part of the game makes no difference, it's the same thing just with a different name and different pictures put onto it.In the FOBA career part you get to choose between 5 classes of champions which are divided into 3 categories themselves and thats about all the information the game gives you. If you choose to play the role of an ADC you have champions divided into chaser, burst and utility. While it might be self explanatory where those might have their strengths and weaknesses it does not matter which you pick. Regardless of the tactic, you might be doing extremely well or extremely bad. I've had winning streaks with miserable rated champions (which is another part of faking your influence towards the rng) and losing streaks with SS (which is the highest rated). I tried choosing tactics that made sense with the little information thats given to me and just to check, I tried doing the opposite a while. No difference.In the management part, it is basically the same. You hire players and they win you games in the lower leagues because they level up really fast and dominate the other teams, but once you get to the tournaments, even with the highest stats on your gamers, it is back to rolling the dice and you don't even get the 50:50 chance you had in the career part. And again tactics don't matter.The forum is full of unanswered questions about mechanics. They announced to leave early access on 29th of April, about a week from now, and it still has bugs which are just horrible. - If you start a new game, you have your player stats from the previous game but your skill level is calculated as if you were a new player which leads to the problem that you can't get any better if you maxed your skills in the previous game (but actually why should one care about it, since stats are an illusion just like choices).- you can unlock different topics to choose from when streaming (one of the ways to earn cash). I unlocked them and they disappeared on me later in the game and I'm stuck with only two topics to choose from (in both saves I played)- my team display got bugged at some point which led to me not being on the team anymore even after moving to a different team, my name just won't show up and since then I wasn't allowed to participate in any team event (not even as spectator, which is one of the options when there are such events)- the most recent one (which led to me writing this review). I was ranked 4th, won a game, and now im ranked -27. It really looks like the devs didn't even think people would play their game long enough to get to that point.Very disappointing.Pros:- the ideaCons:- bugs (the game is leaving early access in a week and still has game breaking bugs)- no feedback on what your tactic/role/champion choices actually do (I'm fairly certain they don't do anything)- there is no strategy involved whatsoever, not from an economic point of view, nor from a tactic/team building point of view.Unfortunately it is a very shallow game and to make it even worse everything has a small clock ticking up. Thats so extensive that I would have gotten to the part where I am in the game in 2-3 hours (or less) if it wasn't there, compared to the close to 15 hours playtime I am at right now.If you want a simulation other than complete rng in an esports environment don't buy it.

												Great game, but I feel that it could be better. A way I would improve it is adding some sort of story to the game that varies based on your performances in a team, I would find it more entertaining having a sort of story and goals you could achieve that is different from just getting a house/joining a team. Another way would be to add some sort of shop to say buy a mouse, keyboard, monitor etc. They could be used to improve stats inside the game. Also the money aspect is broken, you get way too money for the amount of streaming you do in the game. Overall this game has great potential but is not worth getting if not on discount.			"

								This is a really enjoyable game. Similar to Game Dev Tycoon you start solo and work your way up the food chain specializing and gaining money and fame as you go. The game is still basically there isnt much depth but there is lots of potential here. 7/10			"

												No tutorial explaining how to play no in game help options either to try and figure it out yourself. Sadly you have to play around and experiment over and over to try and see what works. When you do this though a lot of the results are so random that even when you do the exact same thing you get opposite results. Overall I wouldn't play the game again and actually got a refund for it. If they fixed these issues I may consider trying it again but it seems unlikely.			"

												Esport terminologies hiding a very basic purely random system.None of your decisions matter as far as I could tell.The outcome of the games are purely random, no matter if you try to adapt the strategy to the team.The feedback is nonsensical (comments about your great farming when you are a support).Save your money, nothing to see there.Too bad, the concept was great.

												One of the worst executions of any idea's since the Atari's E.T. Game. It's essentially a spread sheet with graphics from 1982's apple 2 G's days. Each day can be essentially boiled down to click a button for ""Solo Q"" then click a button on the hero you want to choose (with no explentations of what the heroes do) click another button to see the results (Which at this point is a guessing game) and then repeat. It's not fun, the Dev's put zero time into gameplay, graphics or really anything. It just feels like someone 9 yearold was trying to learn how to make a game, and but this crap out.			"

												I do enjoy this game to a certain extent and I dont mind grinding for skills, but any of the choice prompts you get literally do nothing:Examples: Team ask you to move into their gaming house, you click the ""Yes"" option, everything continues as before and a week later you get another prompt asking you a question with 2 answers that literally have nothing to do with the question and are written in TERRIBLE grammar, not that I'm great with grammar but it very much breaks any immersion you try to get from pretending to be a ""pro gamer"".Pros:-In my opinion a very fun concept for a game.**(See cons)-Very fun for short bursts of time.-Let's you ""groom"" a character to be different kinds of players, like Support or Midlane for mobas.-Gives you option to change game mode from 'Career' to 'Manager' if you tire of the base game.Cons:-** Very poor execution of choices and how your groomed characters' games turn out, ""world choices""(See examples above) LITERALLY does nothing.-You can also choose what type of person you are(I believe it's supposed to impact your skills and choices before games) but it seems like this also has literally no impact as games are decided through what I can only assume is black magic, because no matter if you pick what would be the best choices of action before the game starts, you will still lose and at the same time you can do everything completly wrong and still win by a landslide.-You earn money waaaay to fast, just stream, get an agent, look for a team and boom you get like 80k/week for doing nothing because your team uses another player.-Grammar for some pop-ups/choices is so broken you can't even make out what they were trying to say(Oh wait it does nothing anyway).Summary:Even though I mostly have negative things to say about this game I do still enjoy it for time to time, just wish they would polish what could be a gem instead of half-assing it.I can't rightly recommend what I believe to be a non-finished game that has a long, long, long, oh so very long way for me to consider it ""finished"" for release.

+ Does a great job in simulating what it's like to be a pro gamer while simplifying the process. + There's two different game modes, one you create a character and direct their actions each day, playstyle, sponsorships, and so fourth. The other mode you are a manager who builds a team and trains them to perform well in tournaments. + Visually the game is very colorful and charming+ relaxing music- The game doesn't do a great job at explaining what your choices actually do. I had a hard time understanding the differences between streamers, or what my skills were or how they impacted my performance in ranked games. I also did not understand how the weapons or focus changed the result of a game. Nothing is really explained at all...- Sometimes you get matched against a team with a far higher skill level, and have no chance of winning.- No tutorial or any guide of what to do. This is especially frustrating in the manager mode.			"

Early Access Review
								This game needs a autosave option ASAP, it's 2016, this should be standard and one of the first things implemented, crashes or simple oversight can cost you hours of gaming without it.The game lacks a lot of features and even though the GUI looks appealing at first, the game is slow and doesn't give a lot of options. Definitely not worth any money right know in early access. The moba games played ingame consist of only choosing a hero and choosing 3 strategy options, after that only a progress bar appears and you are constantly waiting in the game and basically wasting time. Not a lot to do in the game overall.			"

												As many others have said, the game feels random. You can play the same tactics in two different matches and it's just as likely you end up with a perfect game as it is to get yourself completely steam rolled. I really hope the devs doesn't intend for the game be so randomly decided, but for now the whole thing ends up in a grindfest: Play enough and you'll eventually win.I really suggest the devs add some sort of turtorial or/and some hints to all the attributes and tactics so you can atleast get an idea of what you are doing when you are combining them. I for one have found little success when trying to figure out good combos and strategies.Other than that: Great concept for a game (about gaming heh), but lacks information on how to actually get good at it.

Early Access Review
								I debated long and hard about weather or not to recommend this game. In the end I decided to recommend it based upon what it currently is as of writing this. This is a game with a really fun concept, with lots of possible potential, however at this time I feel the games execution is abysmal. You can select between LoL or CSGO, I picked CSGO because I don't like MOBAs. However it seems the CSGO options are bare minimum and much more attention has been given to the LoL portion of the game. That is not, however, why I do not recommend this game. That comes from the almost 8 hours I've put into this product and realized that your choices, your skill upgrades, your Hero/Weapon selections, everything you do is basically entirely random. Your rankings and stats as a player are totally meaningless, every match outcome is randomly determined with dice rolls, from what I can tell. Even if it isn't you would never know because the game refuses to tell you ANYTHING. There are no Tutorials, there are no Tips or Hints that are provided to let you know which choices you made incorrectly, no way of actually knowing weather or not you are making the right selections. I can make the exact same selections and get wildly different outcomes every single time a match occurs. The game is also imbalanced in other areas. For example Streaming is by far the most lucrative way to make money, I make enough money from 1 streaming session that it equals like 7 weeks Salary from my Team contract. You can't really interact with anything within the game, it's just ""Play Ranked, make random selections, get random outcome, rinse and repeat"". You can watch Top Ranked players streams to ""learn"" how they play the game and get tips from this. However once again the game does nothing to imply what you've actually learned from watching them, from a gameplay standpoint all that literally does is grant you some Knowledge XP to invest into the Knowledge Tree. Which as I've mentioned has no real function and does not seem to factor into anything. The game also has a problem with assuming the player (you) should already know everything, includeing terminologies such as AWLper or ADC, etc. I've no idea what these terms mean and the game does not care to explain, because obviously you should know already. The game is also littered with Spelling and Grammer errors. You are able to hire an Agent to represent you, and get better contract offers for you, however you are unable to do this unless you already have a team and have a contract already, which imo makes this rather irrelevent for obvious reasons. TL;DR- This is a game that has the potential to be something great in the future, but currently is an uninformative rock paper sicssors game where your stats and rankings dont seem to matter at all, and the game does not explain anything or make any attempts to help you.

I personally love this kinds of simulations and if they ( the developers) can improve on this game such as adding interviews / seeing what happens in the game (Foba) etc etc it would make this game a game to rmb playing.

												If you play moba games or fps games. I recommend you try this game. Yes it has its many flaws. Its a cool concept. Its not 100% random if you win or lose. There are factors that decide that. Are the enemy players better wich you can see now from the skill rating next to the players role icon. I played the moba one because I have never played FPS much that I knew what to do. If you want to play the moba one I recommend you look at the skill ratings and then decide what type of playstyle you go for. Enemy better than you play passive. Around the same skill play normally. And always look at the jungles rating. No matter where you are. If the jungle is better than theirs Set up jungle ganks.I really like this game. And I wish that it will be much better in the future.			"

												Let me start by saying this game has a really good concept. I like the idea of training my gamer into a pro gamer and slowly upgrading his stats to make him a star plater. However, this game is based solely on RNG. I could have mastered aspects that would important to my guys weapon and playstyle and still do absolutly terrible. Nothin gin this game is explaned. There is no tutorial or glossery for what anything means or any explenation. Also, the tournaments are somewhat random, seeing a sI have 93 stars( doesn't explain what that even means but I am assuming it is skill or something) and I could lose to a guy with 35. As well the game has no team practice where you can call your team to practice together. Despite all this I can cautiously recommend this game based on this concept. In all honesty though, it should still be in early access based on the lack of actual skill, refining a team winning strategy, playstyle, and baseing the game souly on an RNG system			"

												Well everyone, I bought this game as a funny meme after watching jesse cox play it a while back. It wasnt terrible in a sense, that it just didnt explain anything in the game.... With esports growing at a rapid rate a good game/tycoon sim of esports or esports management sim would be well received imo. Youtubers Life for example with online entertainment at its highest levels. Sadly, though like most small dev teams that get a lot of hate on their games, instead of fixing it and try to promote the ♥♥♥♥ out of it and earning back the trust of the community. They are abandoing it for sequel. But before the hate rolls in they are promising to fix the game to a decent playable state. They are also giving everyone that bought the game a free ride to the sequel's Alpha....but not the game for free....just the Alpha. So im going to thumbs this down, they want more money after proving they cant use the money they already made off the community correctly. Plus they are going to separate the small fan base they have, by forcing them to buy another game when they never technically got PGM in the first place... I respect you listen to us 501. But fix ya stuff dont take us on a Infestation Z, War Z, Day Z, Ark, No Man's Sky fueled ♥♥♥♥ show ride.			"

												[This is a brand new review for the games relaunch from a new studio. I previouly did not recommend the game, but had high hopes it could be fixed]Well, that was a bummer. I don't know how they could have made it worse, but they did. It mostly has to do with them launching the game with only about 20% of the actual game in it. You make ~10 decisions at the begining, then your only input is when to eat, drink, sleep, and make the decision to play the CSGO clone. You make no decisions in game, there are lots of upgrades to buy that aren't in the current build, and the graphics are, in the kindest words I can manage, fugly. At least the last game let me choose how I would play a particular round and what character and role I wanted to play, even if that ♥♥♥♥ was totally random, and gave me options besides just play the game and sleep. Not only that, but on top of several needs you need to manage (guys, your game is A sim, not THE Sims. I want to play games, not shove food in my face); the time which had previously gone down with every action now ticks down continuously. There was a great game in here before, now there's at best a good one, but in this current build it's neither. It was dropped too early and at this stage I think it would be generous to even call it a beta. Proof of concept for the core mechanic maybe?Immediate update: The dev's know they messed up this launch and had the courage to admit it up front and apologize, which gets huge amounts of respect from me.I'm sorry 501, I can't change the recommend to a ""Yes"", but I still belive in you all and your ability to make a really solid game. The vision you had wasn't terrible, I may have personally disagreed with choices made, but that doesn't mean they're inherently bad. Do ya thang and make the game we know you can.			"

You can join a team but that just means once and a while your team calls you up to either watch your team play or if somehowa miracle occours you will get to play.Manager mode is probably the best area. build your team and then have them win. The league season is fun but the tournament major style (like how you can go to IEM)  is really aweful. you sit around and wait to win with no indicater of what the score of each team is.			"

								Really good game in my opinion, well it has the potential to be. At the moment you can tell it's early access but that isnt a bad thing. I bought this game because it looked a lot like Game Dev Tycoon which i think if they looked at more and take inspiration from their game. All in all it's definetly worth a buy.			"

								I made a player career in FPS as a support player since I myself played support professionally for a while in CS. My only stats were about 0/0/30 or 0/1/26.

												Gave this game a chance. Saw the Negatives and thought, ""im a seasoned VEt. when it comes to sims. Theses guys must not know how to play, etc."" Well now I wish i could get my refund.The Dev of this game had a decent idea, but the way the game works is flawed. Especially in ""FPS"" mode. In FPS you need to be able to control more aspects of the way your guy/team plays the game. Same in Foba.Also;-The Way you win games seems like there is a patter but there isnt-The Lack of in game choices on both player level and Manager level is appalling:You have game swhere you do nothing in player or seemingly randomly switch between Aggressive, Normal, and Defensive in manager- if the basis for FPS is CSGO, then the DEV has never watched a pro game much less played it at a even a GN level. -Stats Don't seem to matter at all, nor is there a way to know what they do.Game has a good premise and seems to try a bit, but needs more interactivity. As it is now it is a button pressing simulator. No strategy, no brains, no customization, no thrill: Just buttons.			"

												The idea of the game is although:. It should still be in alpha, the game needs to be devloped more to reach its full potential.There should be more games to have a team for eg Call of duty, rocket league, Company of heros.You should be able to skip rounds of a competition instead of having to wait.There should be more development on the look of the game, it is extremely similar to a very known game ( game dev tycoon).In player mode you should be able to start a youtube channel and earn revenue from thatI enjoyed the game, but more devlopment is need so that the game can go down as one of the greats			"

								I was debating as to give this game a thumb up or down, but taken the price into account, too bad I must throw out the red one here, should it be around $5, i would've thumb it up.Pros:_ Nice concept, easy to catch up without tutorials._ LoL references_ There're actually a lot of thought were put into it, but to finalize it to the game is another storyCons:_ Typical management game_ 1 save fife, no confirmation option_ limited option for the time being_ totally luck based, said by the developer themselves that the choices you've made before the match have nothing to do with the final result_ Research sux, once again shows no detail information as how it would affect the match's result or simply just for show. You can't master more than 10 champs, and they can even be duplicated, master 10 of the same 1, wtf?Game doesn't disable Speciality research when you have learnt all of them. If you try to research it again it would give you a blank black screen and you'll have to load the save cause there's no ""back"" option._ once again no ""back"" option for most of the choices. By most I mean 95%._ No one would invite you to their team even if you were a No.1 world ranker._ and there's a lot of more sh*t going on after you've bought your own house, i'll let you to see by yourselves.

												This game has a good core idea, but it is carried out horribly.  The major flaw is:  stats and level means nothing to this game   When it comes to the tournament and competetions, your level of skill means nothing, your team members stats means nothing, and how many hours your team played together or how well they cooperate also means nothing.   Even though your team are all aces with 99 on all stats, and your oppenents are trolls with 30-40 stats.. your chances of winning is still 50-50, just like a coin toss.  And all the effort of building the team seems to be all for nothing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

								I haven't really played much of this game. But I think i've played enough to get a good idea of whether or not this game is terrible or not.          Really, this game is nor bad nor good. So far for me personally this game is fairly repetitive and boring. You literally, as far as i've played do the same thing over and over. You play a few games of FOBA and then you go to sleep. You then wake up, play a few games of foba, maybe do some streaming, and then go to sleep.         From the screenshots I can tell it does get a little more interesting when you go further into the game. But until then I guess I wouldn't entirely reccommend this game if it wasn't for one thing. This game is in early access and I know that with the quality that it is at now it needs improvement but because it is in early access, it will be improved.			"

												Do not Buy this Game its a waste of MoneyIf your read the Text for the DLC or the info on the Storepage about the game it rly sounds nice... But actually the game is not even close to a alpha state... it shouldnt even be in early access. The New DLC should focus on the FPS modeWell this is how it works... You start and create your game you distribute 6 Skill Points across 4 different Skills...The icon in the room dont work the have no Symbols nor anythingThan if you play a round in the Game itself it shows you 30 round in a Pac Man Map overlay with some points moving (even on super speed it takes 5-10 mins) where you just sit there and watch a pac man map with moving points without beeing able to do a single thing.... The DLC is a completly different game so if you dont want to be a FPS player but a Moba player you need to start the old game again which hasnt received an update in ages and still is bugged and random that it hurts...This is not a game worth 13€ and definitely not a managing game cause so far you can't do much...The Game had so much potential but it gets driven into rock bottom			"

												This game could be incredibly funny and entertaining if it had more (better: any) depth. Unfortunatelly, after ~ 1-2hrs of gameplay you don't have anything else to do except doing things to get more money, without having any real options to spend it on.Especially after having reached rank 1 in career mode...after that, all I had to do was stop playing matches (without losing rank) and stream stuff (to gengerate more money).On top of that, the outcome of most of the actions available ingame like changing tactics, training, watching different streams feel completely random. Sometimes you lose games, some time you win games but it's hard to tell why you've won or lost respectively.  It starts out fantastic and fun but gets boring real fast.I'll keep my eyes open on this game and see what the future holds for it, but I would be even more disappointed if I wouldn't have bought it when it was on sale.

None of the decisions you make matter, nothing you do matters, and there are no accomplishments.Second of all, the devs are slimy ♥♥♥♥s. They came in mid project and took then entire game over from the original creators. Then, they spend months on a long needed update to not do anything to gameplay, but they make the graphics worse. WORSE. Second update is a gameplay update, but guess what? IT'S DLC that new buyers have to pay for! Now, after the devs have shown they are money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥s that spend minimal effort on actually listening to their customers or fixing what needs to be fixed, they have done another atrocity.They are planning on fixing the game by releasing a sequel.At least people that already own the game will get the sequel for free, right? Since they've been so screwed over already?Nope. People with the current PGM get the very first build for free, but MUST PAY FOR THE FULL VERSION. This game is not even worth 3 dollars, it's so bad, and even if it was only 10 cents I'd ask for you to not buy it because giving them 10 cents is worse than giving EA 60 dollars.			"

								I requested a refund just a second ago. i had high hopes for this one. i wasn't expecting high graphics or anything. but i expected something to cater to us gamers, and for a while it did. until you delved deeper into the game. its really shallow at this point.and the devs are NOT communicating, not via steam forums, and not via their two accounts on twitter. instead they keep on posting and deleting old posts, specially when you comment on them asking them about their plans for the game.i recommend keeping an eye on the game, and not buying it at the time being. the developer looks 'shaddy' at best. and they don't really seem interested in updating their game. your input as far as 'early access' goes is pretty much insignificentEdit: P.S. did i mention that the game events outcomes and match results so far are pretty much random? you got an event. do your skills matter? not really. does your team's skills matter when you're in a tournament? nope.

												This game used to be good when it was focused around a MOBA, but the new update completely ruined it.Reasons why it's bad now:1. The new FPS career takes SO LONG to get through a single game. In the old version with MOBA, the games took a little bit to pick your hero, playstyle, etc. Now it's just sit there for 5 minutes and stare at the screen as a bunch of guys shoot other guys with boolets (not really, it just sometimes says you dead and you fall over), and the announcer has THE EXACT SAME TWO LINES. I can not stress how annoying that is. Please go back to MOBA.2. Now you have to deal with hunger, thirst and hygeine. It's really stupid, because it takes focus off the main ascpect of the game: GAMING! It takes awy from the expierience3. The clock now goes by real time. It used to be that every time you did something (ie Play a match, watch a stream,) it took a little chunk of your time away. That's a good system. I can pace myself between matches and see what ne options I have. But now, as I sead earlier, the clock counts down no matter what you're doing. You can sit there and do nothing all day, and the game doesn't have a problem with that.4. Removed money and upgrades! The only point of actually playing a match is to rank up. You don't even get to choose what team you're on.5. New look of the game is awful. It used to feel very casual, like you're just a guy playing some video games. Now, it feels like you're in some action-stealth movie, which is really overdramatic.It used to be probably a 8/10, but now it's a 2, 3 if you're being generous.Do not buy this game until they fix these things. Donate that mone to a needy cause. Give it to game developers that don't completely mess up their game. Just do anything else with it.			"

												The concept was great, but waiting for the devs to fix any of the bugs that still cripple this game.  Everything is so RNG based that even with max stats, you will still get dumpstered by the worst teams.  The devs refuse to communicate at what is fixed, what is being worked on, basically patch notes consist of ""we did a thing, figure it out.""			"

								This game looks great, and plays great. It easily reminds me of one of my favorite games, Game Dev Tycoon. Yes, this game is in early access, but the simple bare bones concept is amazing to me. Everything done so far is done great for it being VERY early access and bare bones. THe most you can do is find a professional team (or lead one) and make money, and improve you skills. But it is still fun for a time, and this entertainment will only increase as more features are added. Great job developers, and continue the great work.			"

								7/10If you are a keen player of the game dev style game then this could be a great add to your collection and as a casual MOBA  player and Esport enthusiast it was a nice play even if it did feel a little grindy at times.They have smoothed out a lot of the luanch bugs and added a good amount of content so if you're wondering weather to re-dowload the game cause if you didn't like it before then it has just for the better and may now suit your needs.However there are a few bugs still here one being that you can be both the best and worst player at the same time this was quite funny especialy as my K/D/A was 23/0/12.New stuff-Character creationAbility to stream FOBAThe ability to join a team instead of having to make your own. (They give very good wages as well!)Changed how the pre-game and in game of FOBA worksAdded a chaning metaThats all the stuff i noticed since it's luanch but there might be more!I hope you fond this review helpful. :)			"

								After reading the reviews for this game, I was a bit worried about purchasing it. But, seeing as it was on sale, I decided to give it a shot, and I have to say, it was well worth it. I found myself mindlessly playing this game for hours on end. It is not without its issues, however.This game is about as close to the definition of simulation as you can get. If you are looking for a comparison, this game is very similar in design to ""Game Dev Tycoon"". You start out as a small, unskilled player of a game called FOBA (based of MOBAs such as LoL or Dota). As you play, you slowly get better at different champions, and can even start to make money off of your playing, but the real game starts once you create your own professional team.But that does come with a few side effects. As of now, the game has no real tutorial (although I am sure this will be added in the future). After spending about an hour and a half learning exactly how to play and mastering the little details, it was a bit annoying to suddenly start playing what is essentially an entirely different game. The solo play to team play mechanics are pretty much entirely different, but hey, you get two games for the price of one.The bulk of the game comes down to slowly moving up the competetive ranks with your team.You expand your office, hire new team members, and gain a fan base. My favorite part about the whole game is the team system. You can change exactly what each member on your team does in a game, and you can even set specific metas you are playing by.The only real problem I have with the game is its lack of feedback. At the end of a match, you get a few small tips about how you lost and a statement from a specatator, but these generally have to do with specific elemtents from FOBA, not anything you can actually effect. And this is the only feedback you get. When I make a decision to make a certain play or have one of my teammembers slightly change their playstyle and lose, I have no idea what caused the loss. It basically comes down to trial and error. Many people have said that winning/losing is completely random, but I do not believe that is true. There are just a large amount of factors that come into play. The stats of your team, your meta, team matchups, team synerger, morale, roles, the meta you are playing. With all of this, it is easy to lose track of what you need to work on. I think a specific stats page after each game that gives you some explanation as to what you can fix would really help.Overall, this is a fun game. It has a few annoying bugs, and a couple flaws here and there, but that doesn't really hinder the concept at all, or in anyway break the game. After all, the game is still in early access, and only came out a few days ago for that matter. If you are into MOBAs, this game is a must have. Just wait a bit if you are worried about anything I mentioned.			"

								In it's current state I would not recommend this game.The game feels clunky. There are little things that can be improved upon over time, and there are core functionality issues that are not likely to be addressed.-Manual game saves. The game does not autosave. I can't understand why not since you can't have multiple saves.-Acquring new players for your team requires you to drop a player first to open a slot. You may not be able to find a better player than the one you had, but you are still requried to drop the player or a slot won't be open to bring someone new on the team.-What the hell do any of the stats or choices you make during the FOBA games mean? The whole mini-game seems like random choices with random consequences.-Without being able to make an impact on the FOBA games it seems like unnecessary tedium to have to sit through all of the screens over and over.In general it feels like you have very little control or knowledge of what is taking place in the game. You make a few choices and await an outcome. You then repeat this process hundreds or thousands of times. The game lacks depth, clear direction, or any semblance of structure. I don't know what I'm doing, where I'm going, or why I'm doing stuff to go there.Your money can be better spent elsewhere.			"

												Overall good game, great idea, there's variety in the game, so much potential. But the game is missing so much, so many features. I'd like to start off with the lack of documentation in the game, nothing is explained, you have to figure everything out on your own, which after a while makes you believe that everything is running on random chances, because you can be the best player in the tournament, but still loose in the first stage. There's too much griding in the game, if youre in a team and you play a team match it might be a week until you play another team match despite in manager mode your team plays a game every day.There's a lot of bugs to be fized in the game, for example winning an fps match 16:15 (Unless thats a feature?), or loosing the tournament in the second stage yet still getting the prizes. Loosing a cup but still qualifying for the mayor. The list goes on.I'm not riping into the game just hoping to make you guys aware of the state of the game and just to provide some contructive criticism for the game developers. If you guys need some ideas for the game just hit me up I have a ton of eSports experience			"

								I honestly just can't recommend this game.I know it's in early access, but there's such a thing as too early access.There is absolutely no depth to this game at all, the results are all random and you don't feel like you have any impact whatsoever. The first part of the game was alright fun, where you're able to play, stream, watch pros, research etc. But once you expand and get a team, the game completely falls apart.There's no longer any proper way to make money, which means if you saved up to expand and were left with very little, then it's basically game over.  Restart.They have removed any option to improve your character after you have a team, you can't even play for a full week while recruiting a team. Once you have your full team, you can play one game a day, which is also randomized, and doesn't seem to take into account anything you did in the first section, such as mastered champions etc.Overall this game needs a LOT of polishing to be enjoyable.

												Seems fun at first, but then you slowly realize there is seeminlgy no impact to the strategy/champion you play, every ranked match seems like a coin flip and it becomes increasinly apparent in the 1v1 tournament mode.  Being 50+ points up on people I still would lose matches frequently in the tournament, or only win 3-2.  Having no feedback or suggestions anywhere also leads to the meaningless, since you never know if what you picked actually worked only that you won or lost.  Cool idea, horrible execution.			"

												It was horrible. Rly. I was playing manager mode and I have n oidea what i'm doing. No tutorial, but okay there are lets plays. Next - I can do a lot of things, talk with players, call to press, to staff. But what does it change? I DON'T KNOW. You have no feedback what it can change. Game designer have a lot to do here. Bugs - when i'm using player scout i have to reload my save. And when i do it, my B-Team is crashed, so i have to relod it again. But when i reload game, all my staff have no progress, it is reseteing to default value (for example board director - every ♥♥♥♥ing time i have 30 days). And how the ♥♥♥♥ can I win this game? Has it any ending? Or i will play to my death? Last but not least - tournaments, the most annoying thing. Because if I lose in first game I have to ""watch"" all ♥♥♥♥ing matches. And how i can win tournament? I have 99 overall on each player in my team, and I'm still loosing. If it was early access - okay. But it's released and it's piece of ♥♥♥♥ by now. But with potential. But it needs good game designer and UI designer. And a lot of work.Gameplay: 2/10 (boring...)Graphic: 5/10 (pretty nice, but it has poor animations)Price: 2/10 (too expensive, for this product it's worth 6€, not more)Overall experience: 4/10 (it rly has potential... but it's only what this game has by now)			"

Pros +FUN/Chilled+League Of Legends (If you're a fan)+Updated Recently (Talents to come)+Good to see you're player improve and get betterNegative- After you get rank 1 i was hoping a team would pick me up or get a higher following neither happend. - Games/Team None of my team Members improved through winning/writing guides/Team work- After Learning alot of the specaility's nothing really improved. - Should be a bank loan for when you're company is -100 below budget. - Winning was never me picking correctly it felt very RNG. I will continue to play this game when im bored cause none the less its a fun game when you're bored and just want to watch movies on the other screen while playing some Pro Gamer Manager.  "

Early Access Review
								As of 2/4/16, I have beaten the game and probably have some sort of plausable opinion considering that I play MOBAs on a regular basis to say this game is playable yet boring and doesn't simulate pro/casual player.I want to preface this with a message to the developers:STOP TRYING TO ADD NEW THINGS TO DIVERSIFY THE GAME AND START ADDING CORE MECHANICS TO WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. THE GAME IS BROKEN AND AN UNENJOYABLE FIRST EXPERIENCE.Onto the review.Your champion/character picks don't mean anything since their role means nothing, their position in the meta or OP Chart means nothing since it doesn't impact matches, and you can't dictate anything in the middle of the game. The Pick/Ban phase is useless, since you chose your character prior to the actual select (which nobody would do), and you can't improvise mid game to change playstyle. You do nothing for your character, you can't see what's going on, you can't post-analyze the match, and you can't give your person/character an area to work on. Champion mastery is also irrelevant. When I select a character who I have never touched before I have a higher winrate than a champion I have spent most of 4 hours working on.The FPS category is irrelevant since there's literally nothing there. Just some icons.Managing a team was fun until your players started underperforming for no reason, with no statistical proof of lack of ability to play the game, and you can't negotiate or haggle using contracts with players so you're often stuck with a level 2 mid laner in a team where everyone is level 80+. (I know they don't have levels, it's just easier to explain using such lingo).My biggest pet peeve is that the character mean nothing. Literally nothing, they're just icons with smaller icons in the top left corner. They don't have pros, cons, weaknesses early, weakness late, magic or physical damage reference, and in general mean nothing. This means that you can't really help your ""team"" when they ask you for a single target burster. What? Does this fairy thing do burst damage, aoe damage, or does this dragon heal? There is no explanation to characters.TL;DR This game is a shell and technically shouldn't be an early access game since this isn't a game right now. But I very much like the concept and it would be awesome to manage a character that you love and want to improve and win the FOBA (whatever that stands for) world championships.			"

								Overall, I say this game is decent. Not good, but heading in the right direction. Once Early Access if over it will hopefulyl be better. I recommend it if you have played early access sims before and are alright with what that entails. Not only that, but I only recommend this because of the potential, good basis for the game, and good faith.Below my pros + cons are also some suggestions for improvements in the game that I hope the devs see someday.Here are my first impressions of the game, and what most people will experience in their first few hours. Not a lot of pros, I know, but trust me that this game is only getting better!Pros:+ Great concept with simple execution+ Enjoyable sim that you can relax with+ Huge potential+ Can play while watching a movie, youtube, etc.Cons- Not enough player feedback, so decisions players make do not always feel meaningful- Very little direction- In-game events need to pop up instead of just sit on the side. Sometimes miss them- WHAT DOES THE YELLOW BAR MEAN WHEN PLAYING FOBA?????? Who knows???- Slow paced (can be pro or con depending)- Many things seem to be controlled by factors the player can't see/understand which leads to frustration and confusionWill update this later on as game develops.Suggested improvements:= More player feedback when they make a decision= Greater explanation of stats= Ability to upgrade your gaming PC= Mouse over choices, heroes, stats, etc. to bring up a window that explains what the hell thing are lol= Ability to cancel a choice if you make it (such as play FOBA, watch FOBA, etc. Currently no way to cancel if you pick the wrong one)= Needs option to change speed.

And when my character changed the role in the team. The ability value start to change randomly. Besides this, this is no system in my point of view. All things are just randomly. It is not like Football manager or Game Tropical. Everything seems to be random. The idea of this game is really good. But like I said, this game need improve a lot in order to success.

Early Access Review
								I would not reccomend this game in its current state. It seems really promising but there are just so many bugs.-Lost a player that i recruited because i didnt know I had to remove somone on my team before i gave them a contract.-When you buy upgrades you dont know what they do until you purchase them and then a screen pops up telling you. -If you go to the recruit player screen and then back out without recruiting someone it wont let you go back and recruit.-Some of the text went off the screen.-I used cheat engine to see if it mattered what players you had on your team, it doesnt. Winning is all RNG.Other than bugs it just seems broken once you get a gaming house. You cant stream from there so there is no way to make money once you buy it. The only way i can see not going bankrupt is if you stay in the first stage and just build up a crap load of money. Also I dont get why you can only recruit one player a day. Another thing I found irritating was that you couldnt hire the staff in the order you wanted, you have to unlock them in a specific order. This made it very difficult to make any money once you got to the gaming house because you have to pay all these high salarys well literally having no way to make money inbetween games.Things I feel should be added-Sound controlls and back buttons for every screen-A screen that tells you how to get each stat up-When prompted to make a decision in a game, I would like to know what came of it.-The ability to practice a champ and stream at the same time. -The ability to stream from your gaming house when you get there-When recruiting players there should be a tab for each role instead of having to come back everyday until a ADC appears on it.-The ability to still work on your charcter once your at the gaming house. -The ability to name your charcter and team. Other than that i really did enjoy the game and i think the concept is amazing. The thing is its riddled with bugs and once you get to the gamming house the game becomes unfun. Im still salty about playing for three hours and then going bankrupt when i had 2 grand in my bank. Still not sure how that happend. I'll check the game out again in a month or two to see if they get this stuff fixed.			"

Early Access Review
								I want to say that I really enjoy this game, but I will give it a bad review just because I hope it can improve. Here is a list of things that bother me and must be fixed:1. There are a lot of grammar mistakes who make this game silly and childish(""i think' 'cant""). These should be adjusted accordingly. It's not really a bug, but would make the game better and more enjoyable.2. The game doesn't have an autosave feature and I've lost my progress 3 times already due to a bug that lead to the game crashing. What happened is that I fastly opened and closed the mailbox(2 fast clicks on the icon) and the game froze so I had to ALT-F4 it.3. The pick/ban phase is TERRIBLE! You always get the pick you want and the role you want, although that never happens in a MOBA, plus, teams ban while players are picking, which should not happen(you ban before you pick).4. During your player career, you can't really see the stats of your team, nor can you see its real league. For instance, I've signed with several FOBA Amateur League #4 and #1 teams, but when I checked ""Standings"", we were playing in the #7th league. Also, if my team wins a game, we don't get points, therefore we don't advance in standings. Moreover, in FPL(the professional league), Team X is always second(same problem with points gain)Althought it was mentioned in another review, I think it's necessary that I also mention the fact that you don't get any tips on how to improve your game after a loss, or even a win. You don't know if the tactics you chose affected the game, how they affected it and whatnot. For instance, what if I am playing an utility champion, but my team is ""EarlyGameTeam""? Did I lose the game because I chose a passive mentality just because I found it suitable for my champion playstyle? Would I have impacted the game more with an aggressive mentality, attempting risky plays?			"

												If you've played Game Dev Simulator, you have a rough idea about what this game is like.The main difference is that Game Dev Simulator was actually entertaining and made sense - your choices have a tangible effect on the outcomes - but not here.Here you are forced to level meaningless stats which seem to affect nothing and to watch dismayed as your fledgeling basement-dweller fails despite the best of everything.Couple the above with unfinished game elements and poor English and nobody in their right mind could actually enjoy it.Despite this, it is adictive, if only so you can try and find something in it that makes any sense2/10 - do not buy			"

												Warning: DO NOT BUY!This game doesn't need a complex review, all you need to know is this: nothing matters!As far as I can tell, winning and losing are strictly random and take nothing that you've achieved, chosen or upgraded into consideration. Your stats don't matter, your equipment doesn't matter, your living conditions don't matter, and your choices during the games don't matter.If anything, the developer of this game has a sense of irony, encouraging players to grind and grind and grind for stats, gear, higher ranks, etc, while never achieving anything; just like real pro-gamers! Well played you sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!If you love butting heads against a random number generator or reading sub-par english then this is the game for you!Personally, I'd just recommend getting a pair of dice and screaming ""ODDS"" or ""EVENS"" at every toss...

												In both modes the computer is so difficult that you have to go through a bunch of crap just to have a decent character. And on top of that in the manager mode you have to have over 160 overall overage to win any games, and it doesn't give you enought money to get any decent players. I do not recommend this game.			"

												Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I bought this game and played it nonstop for about an hour and a half and haven't even scratched the surface. Definately worth it on sale. I does still need some polishing on things like simple spelling and grammar in some popups rarely and expansion, maybe another competetive gaming genre option instead of moba or shooter. Overall worth it. Tons of replay value as you can play four full games, either player or manager under each genre. Unfortunately there are no achievements or cards, please add them soon!			"

												Okay, so I haven't played this game for long and I haven't been able to actually do everything this game has to offer, but so far I am having fun. However, I can already see the improvements that need to be made.You can see the potential coming from this game but there is still much need for new updates. This game is very good, addictive, and with all this content coming, I am left with excitement. Things that need to be improved:-There are many cons to be named but the most important in my opinion is the ranked matches. They all seem strictly random to whether you win or not regardless of what tactics you choose.. -when you're several stars higher than the other players in your pro team, they pick players at a much worse skill level over you. -When you're in a pro team, the league standings don't change at all when your team wins or loses.-Some of the grammar in the texts that come up are not proper english and don't make sense.-When you have a team meeting, whatever you suggest or say to the team leader, nothing happens. The leader seems to not even consider anything you've said. -Weapon mastery seems to have no impact on your overall game/performace as every game seems to have random results.-In manager mode everything is glitchy such as the B team which all you can do is buy and it sorts itself out, no interaction whatsoever. Your team could go from league #1 to #7 randomly? Overall however, this game is definitely fun but already after only playing a few hours I see the need for improvement.			"

								I thought this game was pretty interesting being that it's kind of a metagame: a game about managing one who plays competitive video games. However, I know close to nothing about MOBAs, so the game concepts themselves were very confusing to me. The lack of any kind of tutorial or explanation of the various terms that the game uses really didn't help; I had literally no clue what was going on the entire time. What does ""Jungle"" and ""Toplane"" and ""Midlane"" mean?Maybe worth it if you're a MOBA player who likes tycoon-type games. Otherwise, you might want to stay away until the game at least has a decent tutorial.			"

								The rules to this game make no sense. They smush tons of different stats in your face and expect you to just go with it. Basically you'll just randomly pick and choose crap until things work for you, but you don't really know why they work. This game is not a simulation. It's a random number generator where you can sometimes, randomly reduce or increase the range of numbers to reduce/increase your odds of winning.Learning doesn't give any meaningful advantage or insight into progression. Choosing different strategies seems to change very little. The champions all look extremely generic and I'm not sure if each one even changes anything. I mean honestly, this game is as far from sensical as you can possibly get. There is probably no amount of tutorials that will help this game make sense. Just don't play it...			"

								So obviously this is in a beta form, but there's some warning signs.For one, the music is bad and shockingly repetitive.  Painfully repetitive.  The other sounds are beyond simply uninspired to the point where they sound like they were taken from old Fisher-Price baby toys.The game has very little depth to it right now.  Most of the time you are literally just watching the same boring animations over and over.  There's no transparency to what's going on and while you do improve over time, it never feels like it makes any difference what you do.  You just will improve over time.But then there's the dev's shockingly bad choice to force the player to start as a support.  Not only is this unrealistic, it demonstrates how badly the dev understands these games.  Support is not the trash position you throw newbies into.  And paying 45k dollars to learn another role?  What?  lolAt this point, save your money.  There's nothing to do in the game, it's boring to look at and painful to hear.			"

												I like pro gamer manager. If you like games in which you don't need everything is not spoon fed, this is the game for you. First, there are no guides or online information. In fact, it reminds me of days when gamers had to go to bookstores and actually buy magizines for reviews. That is how hard it is to get good information. I actually am in the process  of figuring the game out. Yes you have to learn this game the old fashioned way through trial and error. However UI is not intuitive but again, if you have time, you can learn the UI and figure out what is the best tatics for your in-game avatar. It is all in the there, you just have to find it.Overall, this game requires paitance and time. If you have neither than this game is no for you. If you have to be spoon fed everything about the game at the beginning, this game is not for you. If you want to make time for a well made and complex game, than buy it.			"

Pro Gamer MangerFirst off, let me just star by saying this game is still being worked on! If you are looking for a clean and polished up game, this is not for you, but if you're willing to bear through the bugs and glitches of this game, it can be quite fun. And all of the reviews out here say it is entirely based on RNG, that is partially true, but there is still an aspect of strategy to it. For example if I am playing support on an Early Game Team vs. a Full AD Team, I would choose to go aggressive and harass the enemy team in laning phase, becase we have the early advantage, and protect the frontline in teamfight where we are weaker. (When I played this in game I got a 10 and we won.) But, if in that same scenario I had choose to go passive and stay with my ADC in lane, and split the enemy team in teamfights, we would get destroyed.(When I played this in game I got a 2 and we lost.)Now here are some pros and cons to this game according to me:ProsRelated to other games we know and love (CS:G0, LoL, Dota2, HotS, etc.)Relaxing, no stressRuns on toastersVery different options you can go (FPS, ""FOBA"")Active Dev Team, pumping out updatesNice MusicConsBroken EnglishNo tutorial (coming soon though)RNG basedLots of grindingSingle-player (multi-player coming soon)In conclusion I would only buy this game if you are looking for a long term investment, that will get better as the months go on. This game just needs a bit more polishing up, and then I believe it will be much better.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello, IHazMagics here and I wanted to talk about a recent game added to Steam. Pro Gamer Manager. Wherein you take the control of a Pro Gamer wannabe with grand aspirations. What I’m going to talk about is a few reasons you should buy the game, and a few reasons you probably shouldn’t. Please note, I don’t have an affiliation with the developer Millenway Studios, this is all from personal experience from game time I’ve had after release which, as of recording is about a day. There may be some words, or terminology that require understanding of MOBA’s in general, if you don’t have that understanding please, ask me to clarify, and I’d be happy to do so.So first off, the game is reminiscent for those that have played a game dev type game. It’s $9.74 USD currently. The first mark I’d put against the game is there’s not really a steam community as of yet. This isn’t a massive mark against the game as it could grow with time and be something that gets larger. However, there’s a very distinct lack of presence from the development team in the Steam forums. That’s something I’d like to see change.Ok, the premise of the game. I personally play a lot of League, but this game will appeal to you regardless of MOBA, although it’s very clearly marketed towards League players. You start as a casual player and seem to gain fans very quickly, while I accept this is intended, it does feel somewhat strange. Personal preference. Moving on. Minor add, lots of spelling mistakes, but it’s a foreign company, so I’d take that with a grain of salt.The first bug I encountered, is the incredibly lackluster menu. The tablet system that explains parts of the game (does it?) and gives you random announcements seems like an ill thought of overlay that doesn’t add anything and instead clutters the screen (which you can still access the base menu while in).Eventually, you’ll come to researching comfort picks. Which is nice. However, if you research the same champion again, instead of adding extra points into understanding an existing comfort pick, it simply creates another entry for the same champion. On top of that, not only does it create a fresh champion, it doesn’t have the same level of played experience. Which is supremely disappointing.Another bug I’ve encountered is also to do with comfort picks. Once you pick your 6th champion as a comfort pick. Selecting them in any game since, will have you selecting your 5th comfort pick. To experiment, I selected a 7th comfort pick champ, and it still picked the 5th.The options menu is completely barren, by which I mean it doesn’t exist. Want to mute your game? Sorry pal, not gonna happen. You have a very sub standard amount of options when you open the game (restricted to what resolution, whether it’s windowed or not, and what monitor it’s displayed on).After playing more and creating a random e-sports league you lose a lot of your individual identity. So I feel it should be clear whether you’re creating a team to be a part of, or creating a team to be the coach of.Basically, after playing the game, I don’t feel as if I have any agency, or any control over my pro gamer path. I’m just doing things, as I see them and if I have enough research then yep, I’m gonna do that. However, the effects of said research aren’t apparent beyond showing up in a profile and certainly aren’t explained through any tutorial.Which leads me to the last thing. A tutorial… Where is it? This game expects you to understand what’s going on straight from the get go, and if you don’t…. Well it doesn’t actually matter because you’ll still get fans anyway. Any of the choices in game don’t seem to have ANY impact long term, where they really should.As it stands right now, if what I’ve said interests you enough to support the dev team, please do so. If however, what I’ve said has made you consider where you spend your money, I think you are making a smart choice, and when the dev’s decide to make the game both A) true to the experience and B) work, then it will be a good game.

												Original post 20/10/2015: The game as is right now, is playable, and enjoyable. Is it worth it? I really don't know, if you are willing to get a very flat game(there aren't many things(mechanics/feauters) in the game), you can check it out(and by that I mean buy it), otherwise you should go after some other tycoon(GDT, MadGames Tycoon between any and many others) or any other game.UPDATE 25/11/16: Hey, maybe after the first hours It'll get boring because the game is so RNG based. Hopefully the FPS mode update comes soon.UPDATE 28/12/16: Yo, I didn't really enjoy the 'BIG UPDATE', I'm really starting to change my opinion about the game.(LOL, sounds like I'm writing a daily log)UPDATED 25/1/2017: Honestly, the DLC in my honest opinion is even worse than the normal game, even more boring. As a player who invested some time(40+ hours), I've lost the joy of playing it. And I've just seen the news that PGM 1 won't be worked on anymore(or so I believe) because 501Industries just announced that ""They failed hard, twice, with this game, and that in order to fix the things they've failed, they have to develop PGM2"". So, all in all, if you want a half-game, feel free to buy this game(I'd recommend buying when it's on sale, if at all).My review used to be the thumbs up, but the fact I've lost hope on this game and the news that it'll be discontinued meant that I had to show my ""discontent"" in some way.

												Good idea, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ realization. The game is filled with bugs, the gameplay is repetitive and instead of fixing the game, devs decided that they will stop further development and make PGM 2 instead, so they could get even more money.

												Unimpressed with this - an interesting idea that is ruined by poor execution.There is no consistency to winning in the game, it seems to be pure luck each time you play depending on how the RNG spins. One game you'll win 28-2 the next lose by 30 - 1.The game does not give you any explanation why, and the options for picking your gear/playstyle does not have a consistent effect on the game.To top it all off they have recently posted that they are not fixing this game but releasing a sequel - which they claim will fix the issues in this game! - Don't make a sequel to a game that you haven't even finished/fixed. Please do not give this any more money.			"

Lastly, STOP promoting your other games on this games update page. it seems to me like your trying to make up for you mistakes of this game by showing us other games that youve (devloped/ published). When i look at this games update page i want to see nothing but this game's updates and then we will talk once your new patches are worth me look at your other games. so focus on this game first before shoving your other games at me. because this game doesnt show me that the others are good based on what ive seen on this one.

												This game has been revamped and the career mode has been redone. The redo, however, is nowhere near where the game used to be, which is saying something. For starters, you can customize your player avatar, but when you're playing the career mode, your character is noticably absent from the screen. There's just a room where you have to click on various items in your room to do different things. You have to manage various needs (energy, rage, hunger, and bladder) while you play. Also, the choice of game (MOBA vs FPS) has been taken away and you're forced into being a FPS gamer, which I didn't want to be. I just played one match and you sit there and are forced to watch 30 rounds of repetitive sounds going back and forth as you're either part of the terrorist or counter-terrorist teams trying to arm or disarm the bomb. I am severely hoping this is merely a phase 1 of the remake and not the whole thing. If this remake is the whole career mode, then I can't believe I'm actually saying that the game took a huge step back.			"

								This game shows a lot of potential, and i only recommend this game because i personaly believe in the developers as they are actively communicating and listening to the community, and changing the game accordingly, however, as of right now, the game is not worth the money, as the game is unfinished, and very confusing, you will loose games with no indications of why, and you will choose to main champions in a game much like DotA and LoL, without getting any information about the champions themselves, making it very hard to play, but the future content that is promised looks great, and every patch improves the game a lot			"

								FIrst off, let me say that it is a fun game.I have a handful of complaints.  Some have been pointed out by others.Here I go.My first major issue with the game stems from what appears to be a bug in the game.  For some reason, after a certain date my team no longer participates in the league matches.  Sure I get news and everything but what's the point of playing if I can't play in the league matches?Second issue is when you first start out playing and accidently click on the same champion to master.  You are forever stuck with the two champions mastered but guess what they are the SAME. Thirdly, you should be able to name yourself as opposed to have some bogus name autogenerated for yourself.  What kind of manager game forces you to take on an identity that isn't yours?Fourthly, you can't change the name of your own team even after I received a news from a teammate that I should consider changing it.  To summarize, it's a good game with good idea.  Terrible execution by the developers so far.  I would not recommend this game to anyone until these bugs are fixed.			"

								Very similar to Game Dev Tycoon when it comes to how the game is played as a whole. If you enjoyed GDT, I highly recommend this. MOBA players may also find this to their liking.They started off needing a lot more incorprated into the game but this first patch has definitely answered to several complaints given by players. If they keep up with their players and continue improving the game, this will undoubtedly be quite an entertaining game you can sink a good few hours into; well worth the price.			"

												TL;DR: It was good before they removed the choice of which game you could play. Images provided are NOT current and do not display the current state of the game.So I got this game back when you could choose if you wanted your character to play FOBA (a MOBA based game) or FPS routes (as you can see in the original images) and it wasn't bad. Sure you didn't get much feedback and the randomness of the outcome wasn't very clear but it was fairly enjoyable.Now however the developers seem to have taken a new route with PGM meaning you can only play the FPS game (which is based on Counter Strike it seems). I realise that this is likely to make development easier but at the same time it annoys me that I come back to pick up where I left off and discover that now instead of having a choice of which my character would play, he MUST be an FPS player or managing one.So for those looking at the images shown thinking it looks like it could be alright, I'll warn you now that the images are out of date from what the game is now like and you should not look to get that game which has been half scrubbed.

												After the 10 hours I put in this game I can't really tell you anything at all about the heroes you pick, what makes most stats go up, which heroes are good counters to others, how the specialties affect your playstyle, how any of the stats affect your playstyle, or how to get wins outside of hoping for the best.It has its moments of being a lot of fun, and theres a ton of potential so I hope the devs keep working on it and updating it (which seems to be the case) but for the moment the game gives you almost no information as to what you should be doing / could be doing to get better, or any inisght into any different playstyles. The complete lack of tooltips, a help section, or even a tutorial makes this game very frustrating because you're left to guess about so much. I hope I get to change this to a thumbs up in the future, its just missing too much at the moment still.**EDIT** Do not not buy this game under any circumstances. The game that was released was not even a little finished and after promising for months that new updates were going to be implemented players were given news that it was finally happening this week. But they had the nerve to say that these new updates were going to be a DLC and that while people who own the game already will be able to download it for free that they intend to charge for it in the future.I repeat, these developers think its okay to charge you for a game that isn't even a little finished and then charge you again for an update that fixes part of the game...

												I mean, I like it, but I'm also very conflicted how to reveiw this. For one, as the other reviews probably say, the game is indeed broken. But not unplayable broken. You can make progress in the game, you just need patience however. At least the Devs listen to the community and are working on a (hopefully better sequel), and are willing to compromise on several issues. Unfortunately, I can not reccomend it at the moment, but I look forward to the potential of the sequel.			"

												A complete waste of time.None of the decisions you make affects your result that much. Everything result you get is determined by luck. Your player could have 80 in skills and yet still get beaten by another player with 40 in skill 3-0. Everything is random. There is no feedback system. You are paying money to sink in hours to click at the same pattern of buttons over and over.The game does not give you respect enough to tell you the most basic of ""e-sports"" term, nor does it respect your descisions. I don't know how game design 101 managed to slip through the cracks like this. God doesn't play dice.I tried to dig in to see if there is any worth to this, I really did, but this game is a complete luck based game. You're better off playing something else.			"

												UPDATE 7-7-2016Game is DEAD. No updates have been made in quite some time. No new updates look to be coming. There were still SO many issues left unresolved. After an initial positive review of the game, in the hopes they would actually FINISH the game, I have to go ahead an NOT reccomend this game any longer. Spend your hard earned bucks elsewere. UPDATE: 4/15/2016Okay, if you loved Game Dev Tycoon then you will see this game has SO MUCH potential it isn't even funny. GET IT WHILE IT'S ON SALE! Now that that's out of the way there are still some gapeing holes, and I'm not talking about the kind your team leaves during a MOBA match. Mostly polishing, some gameplay issues, but everything overall is pretty neat for an early release.(WHY we still call games ""early release"" when EVERY GAME ON STEAM these days is an early release baffles me) but I digress. Why you should buy it:Somewhat original concept... create the gamer you've always wanted to be not the n00b you actually are.Upgrades, Research, Customization of in-game in-game character a plus with more on the way from Devs. ( you are a gamer playing a gamer, playing a game.... Gameception, Check )Ability to choose how you play the game before, and during the game's game.If you are a MOBA fan that loves simulation, you will fit right in.If you are a simulation fan that is scared of DOTA2 and Russians, you will fit right in!I will update my review upon final release but so far so good. Worth it when it's on sale. Cheers!UPDATE: The devs are a small team of dedicated gamers and industry proffesionals looking to improve their game as fast and as best as they can. If you have any suggestion I reccomend e-mailing them at: developers@progamermanager.com     They respond quite promtly, 3 hours it took for my response. It wasn't a ""canned' response with <insert name here> they actually ready the e-mail and the miriade of questions and concerns I had about the game. VERY impressive.UPDATE: 4/15/2016   WOW! Been with this game from the beginning and it is great to finally see how far it has come. Even MORE excited with how active the Devs have been answering and implementing many of the things the community was screaming for. The new FPS and Manager mode make the game infinitely more playable. Looking forward to many more hours of enjoyment! Cheers!			"

												After the 10 hours I put in this game I can't really tell you anything at all about the heroes you pick, what makes most stats go up, which heroes are good counters to others, how the specialties affect your playstyle, how any of the stats affect your playstyle, or how to get wins outside of hoping for the best.It has its moments of being a lot of fun, and theres a ton of potential so I hope the devs keep working on it and updating it (which seems to be the case) but for the moment the game gives you almost no information as to what you should be doing / could be doing to get better, or any inisght into any different playstyles. The complete lack of tooltips, a help section, or even a tutorial makes this game very frustrating because you're left to guess about so much. I hope I get to change this to a thumbs up in the future, its just missing too much at the moment still.**EDIT** Do not not buy this game under any circumstances. The game that was released was not even a little finished and after promising for months that new updates were going to be implemented players were given news that it was finally happening this week. But they had the nerve to say that these new updates were going to be a DLC and that while people who own the game already will be able to download it for free that they intend to charge for it in the future.I repeat, these developers think its okay to charge you for a game that isn't even a little finished and then charge you again for an update that fixes part of the game... Do not support this crap			"

												Well this game is abandoned now anyway.Even a monkey would have made a better game. I mean how hard is it to give us some kind of text to the heroes when playing moba? there wasnt even a name for the champs, let alone any information of ""skills"". everything was rndm. you had no clue in how any decision affected anything.even when i played fps. my team was maxed out and i still lost to freaking weak teams. i mean srsly -.- and how someone can charge 13 euros for this game is not understandable. we had for years and years FREE online games for counterstrike simulations where you could as well hire your team and train them. You could even make tactics and watch your team fight, against other human players and their teams with their tactics !!! These games had been FREE !!! THEY DID NOT COST ANY MONEY !!!The best thing is. This ""game"" if you can call it so is abandoned in an official statement, they want to start over and still charge us money for PGM2 even though we already bought the empty shell PGM1 and they dont even take PGM1 out of the steam shop. you can still buy it.Srsly if i would be a developer and i have pretty old but rlly good games out there that are free and actually work, i would have contacted these guys from these browsergames. team up and make sth rlly stunning out of it.Look at Motorsport Manager. 1 Person developed a game for mobile devices and a big company teamed up with him and they made a rlly great game for PC. nobody expects stunning graphic for PGM. but i mean come on. Motorsport manager costs what, 23 euros? 10 more than PGM, but it delivers so much more. if you would care about this game and not only about money, you would have done things differently. why adding fps mode when even moba is unplayable? why adding a manager mode when the solo career is ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable. what is so hard in adding a few lines of text or a few names for the champions? you dont need awesome coding to add a few letters here and there. you dont need your coders to brainstorm all the ideas. take a rndm player from the PGM community with a bit of heart and brain and you will get all the ideas you need to make a stunning game.

												There are so many things wrong with this game that it is hard to narrow it down. Personally, I think the worst thing is that the entire game seems to be entirely random. None of the choices you make ever seem to make a difference with the results of each match.			"
