												Disclaimer: I am a real life ping pong playerThis was not what I expected. I play a lot of real life ping pong and was excited to be able to play at home. This isn't anything like the real game. I had to dramatically change my style. The spins don't register as well.Summary: If you are a real life ping pong player, you won't enjoy this.UPDATE: It looks like this review garnered a lot of attention and maybe criticism due to its short amount of words.Let me be clear of my expectations: I bought this game because I love ping pong. This game isn't being advertised as some futuristic pong like game like Holoball. The picture literally says ""table tennis simulator,"" so the game should simulate playing ping pong. Did it correctly simulate table tennis? NO. It's nowhere close to being the real thing and doesn't deserve to be called a ""table tennis simulator.""			"

								Holy crap this is good.  Bought it not expecting much and was immediately impressed at how well it plays.  A loss in the semi-final of the TT cup later and I'm absolutely astonished at how good this game is.  It really feels incredibly close to playing actual ping pong.Completely forgot I was wearing a VR helmet.  This was so much fun, imagine this with a proper season mode and different characters as oppoenents etc.  It would be fantastic.What it currently is for the price is by far the best value/quality I've come across on VR so far.  So good, do yourself a favour and pick this up.			"

								Hey now, this game is fun and plays much different than the other VR Ping Pong game on steam. I love the different and difficult serve mechanism. The AI is pretty decent and puts up a good challenge. I love the crowd interaction while you play. Looking forward for the other features that are coming soon. This game rocks and if your ping pong fan, check it out.			"

								Good game. Easy to lose myself in it.  Not sure if I'll be better or worse in real ping pong after this, but since I don't have room for a real table this will do just fine. I look forward to the game maturing. It would be nice if the crowd responded to player actions, like raising both hands starts them doing the wave. Maybe it does and I just haven't found the right combination of movements.			"

								Very fun.  Took a few games to get used to the feel of it, but after that I can beat the easy AI level in most games.  The arcade games are a fun break from the regular matches.  Can't say whether its better or not than other ping pong games, but the feel of real ping pong is certainly there.  Dev seems dedicated to making it feel very good, so I'm keeping hope alive.It's 5 bucks, just get it you dirty animals.			"

								Just plain awesome! Now I can play ping pong whenever I want on my vive and that too for a low low price of < than 5 bucks! I'm no expert ping pong player but have played a bit of table tennis in college. This game is fun and essentially, captures the 'ebb and flow' of a real match. The environment is good, the crowd's applause and boos help with the immersion and the modes so far (a full tournament, broken table mode where parts of the table where the ball bounces disappears, practice mode etc.) are well realised. The physics could do with little tweaks though, the serving mechanics take some time to get used to (I don't have a problem with it though I can see why people would want other options) and a multiplayer mode would be awesome (devs are aware of this request!). The devs appear dedicated and the update today (7/11/2016) seems to have implemented a few community requests already (logo on ball, serve using any button). All in all, you cannot really go wrong with this game at its current state and price (it's worth more, seriously)!			"

								Talk about addictive. It's definitely not 1:1 with real ping pong, just like pool nation is not 1:1 with real pool; but it feels DAMN good. Sometimes I feel like I'm being cheesed on the harder level or in the later stages of the tournament with the rabid corner shots (that deflect directly off the side of the table but give the AI a point). I found myself laughing hysterically standing about 5 feet behind the virtual table in the last round of the TT Tournament, Forrest Gumping my way to a narrow defeat. Could not be more pleased, especially at under $5.			"

								So, in my opinion, this is the first killer app for VR. Ping pong is a game where you dont get tired of the mechanics right away. A lot of games are fun, but this one is the first one that really encompasses the whole sport per say. If you like ping pong, this is the game for you. It has a tournament so you feel like you are progressing, somethign a lot of games dont have. Dificullty is nice, I have played a little bit of ping pong in real life and am pretty average at it. The average opponents on here I can defeat about half the time so far. Close to real life as I have seen.Things to work on- Air resistance, I felt like a lot of my shots went long when they  probably shouldnt have- English, I see the ball spinning in the game which is really cool, but it doesnt seem to curve- Side\corner bounces, Also another cool feature, but they should probably be limited somehow, because a few times I was tempted to jump into the wall to go after a ball that hit the exact edge of the table. Perfectly viable in real life, but maybe tone it down for headset wearers.- Better graphics, I like the current ones, but could probable be upgraded- Last, maybe a coach of some sort, or a girlfriend\friend that cheers just for you, gives you tips, jeers the other team with funny one liners.Overall, really great start, and something I could play 'as is' for hours. I will try to update once I get more game time in.			"

								Feels very much like real table tennis once you get used to the slightly different feel of it, which is that you can't hit the ball quite as aggressively as you can in real life, but it's not a huge adjustment to make. After about 3 hours of gameplay it feels natural and reminds me a lot of the real thing. The only frustrating things are the sudden bursts of power, i.e. you're going for a normal shot and the ball just flies too far with full power, seemingly for no reason. Not a huge problem in the first matches but when the AI gets tougher these 'glitch shots' kinda ruin the feel of an evenly matched game. Serves are often problematic too since they tend to go full power very easily. Other than that the serve mechanic is very nice in my opinion and feels natural despite it being one-handed. That and the AI hits the ball onto the sides/corners of the table a bit too often. I know this happens in real life too all the time but not this often :). All in all a very enjoyable experience. I don't really play a lot of games for hours on end anymore, but this feels like it could be one of those games. With VR games like this it's actually starting to feel like it's bridging the gap between games and real sports, this game (when the kinks are ironed out) isn't about who presses the keyboard or controller quicker, it's only about you and the racket. As such it's immensely more rewarding than games that only require you to press skill buttons consecutively.			"

								This is a really cool fun simple game. I use to play real ping pong when I was a kid growing up so I know how it feels like to play it. The moves and dyamics in the game is excellent, it feels exactly like the real thing. It's a little hard playing against your opponet even in the easy level, but the more you play the more you'll like it, and it's the best little work out you could get in your room with a computer! Highly 5 stars!!! good job :)			"

								Liked- Great job with physics and explaining it all.- Handles fast hits well.- A table tennis game!!!Disliked / Suggestions- Serving is unnatural, using the same controller. Please use the second controller to throw instead, and discard use of grip button - it's not easy to use. (resolved in update 12/07/16)- Sound of the ball makes it feel like a golf ball.- Yellow line at eye level in the background is a distraction and is a similar color to the ball. Please change the line color. (resolved in update 12/07/16)- Pressing grip button to receive every serve is uncomfortable.  Either automatically serve with a visual clue or use another button that is easier to use like the trigger. (resolved in update 12/07/16)- Feels like i'm playing in an empty swimming pool (intended?). (addressed in update 12/07/16)Recommended as-is after update on 12/07/16 addressed most of my gripes.			"

Starting to get to grips with serving and even managing to hit some good clean winners. Can beat the AI on easy and medium is pretty competitive so I do feel I'm getting better the more time I put in to it. Would really love some haptic feedback so you can feel the ball off your bat. Also this game so needs online multiplayer. Love to play against a human ;)No real complaints though, this is a must buy for table tennis fans. Or if you are looking for a good.

								Its like the devs pulled an 8-bit table tennis game straight out of the 1980s, and added VR support...It's magical! The first time I opened this game, I almost instantly fell in love! The simplistic-retro look of the environment along with the realistic-modern look of the table and ping pong balls, just fit perfectly in VR. Customization is a huge requirement for a VR Ping Pong game, and VR Ping pong certainly fits the bill. When you open up the options menu, you are greeted with many different customization options to make the game right for you. This includes; Ping Pong ball color, paddle rotation in degrees, audience on/off, left or right hand serve, sound volume, roomscale rotation, and many more. You can really change the game any way you like. The graphics of VR Ping Pong are great! The art style is very unique and pleasing to the eye. Looking at the game in the Vive looks much better then looking at the game on a 2D trailer. VR Ping Pong's physics are not perfect, yet they are certainly close. You are unable to provide a spin to the ball, however the rest of the physics in the game feel very realistic and intuitive. The difficulty of this game is about the same as real table tennis. At first, I totally sucked. But after playing for a while, I eventually got the hang of it and had lots of fun. My ONLY complaint, if you can even call it a complaint, is its lack of multiplayer. I feel as though playing with someone online is almost crucial for this type of game. I know developing a multiplayer aspect to a game is very difficult, but I believe it would provide another level of immersion. If you are a fan of table tennis, I highly recommend you pick up this game, Especially for its low price of $5. Its very fun, and has a high replayability level. Disclaimer: Even though I have received this product for free, I was not directly told to review it. This is my own honest and unbiased opinion and everything in this review is my personal point-of-view.			"

Early Access Review
								Great Ping Pong game. It does take a little time to get used to the weight of the Vive controller and the ball may feel a bit lighter than a real one but after 10-15 mins of adjustment you will be hitting corners left and right. I would advice to play with the paddle rotation in the setting since thid made a great differece to me.As it is an early access game, it does not have many options. You can play a game or a tournament (difficulty increases by round rather than by opponent), practice vs an AI opponent, and play some minigames (at the moment there are three with a couple more to come soon).There are a couple of things that can -and probably will- improve:-More variety in the opponents. Right now they always look the same despite having different names. There could be some with black/blonde/no hair, different skin tones, eye colors or clothes, etc... This would give more variety to the matches (left handed opponents?).-It would be great if the Tournament could be expanded with a ""World Tour"" option in which particular tournament results could be tracked through a season (think Mario Kart).-Right now you can choose between four default positions for the table. However, an option to reposition it manually would be very welcome (Pool Nation VR does this brilliantly).-I know this is probably overkill for a $4.99 game, but it would greatly improve the longevity of the game if different opponents would have different play styles. Some could be very agreesive, others play always defensively, some would have a great service, while others would smash any ball that goes higher than it should.In any case, don't let these points prevent you from buying the game. For $4.99 it is a really well done Ping Pong game. Playability, graphics and music are already pretty good and the developer keeps working on it and updating it (the last update went live today).

								Having only played the practice mode, I've fallen in love with this game.Playing on easy, the AI opponent reached 100 wins when I reached 25, I was determined to try and improve, at each interval, I was desperately close as they got to 200 but I only reached 98.That might sound bad, but the important thing for me is I feel that I've improved in a way that can't be replicated in standard games, and no loss was ever the games fault. The feedback feels so real, helped by the fact that ping pong balls by nature are light anyway, but still the controller vibration on impact and physics just makes you feel like you're interacting with a real environment. It's exciting and fun and I can't wait to try all the other modes available.Though IRL I had been more into tennis, with the lack of anything for that I looked across all the table tennis/ping pong games and this stood out based on other reviews, and with my limited experience in it I sincerely this feels like a well crafted experience by someone who cares for it, and the updates that have been made already are encouraging.Though not bad either, I can't see myself even returning to holoball after this which is the closest VR comparison I've played myself. If you're interested at all, don't wait for a sale and support this developer by purchasing the game at a price that already feels like a steal.			"

								For the money it's great and quite fun, takes a while to get use to.Developer. PLEASE consider adding the option to rotate the paddle by 90 degrees. I found it really awkward to hold at the angle that felt right to me (maybe I've got bad ""technique"") ;)It would also help with the weighting which feels off when I rotate the physical controller to be right for my ""style"".Also. A way of skipping over the long drawn out menus that you have to go through to either start a new match or if you fail on an arcade challenge. If there was a button press that would just instantly put you back to a new NPC match or start the arcade again that would be great. thanks :)Overall great though!			"

												This game is surprisingly good as a sport simulation, with a large space for improvement.When I bought the game I expected a wii style game but it is actually different. In wii you just need to reach the ball then hitting back is basically automatic with a flick of hand but in this game you will need to do the full real-life movements. In the game I preserved most of my play style and weaknesses from reallife table tennis so in terms simulation I would say it is the most realistic simulation game I have played.The top and back spin are pretty decent but there is no side spin in the game.What I would complain about in the game is that for a serve the tossing and hitting are done with the same hand. It is really hard to get used to. I think the Following can be improved:Serve : a serve should be done using both hands, one to toss the ball and the other to hit it.Spin :  side spin should be added to the game, it is a major part of pingpong.

								As an Early Access game, I really think this game it's even worth a full release right now.After first adjustments on the ball bouncyness, I could easily get the hang of it, behaving exactly as you would expect from  a ping pong game. Also, I could also slice the ball, which is a super bonus to the variety of shots you can do.Really appreciated the menus, everything felt ""VR-like"". I'm in line now for a multiplayer mode :)			"

								I wavered a bit on whether or not the flaws of the game would merit a negative review. I am going to give the game some slack for being early access, as well as for the amazing amount of what's really there.From first impressions, it feels great. After a few games and getting a feel for the ""weight"" of the ball, I'm playing like I did in the college dorms. It really is like playing ping pong. That said, there are a lot of edge cases that need work. For example, the tracking of collisions with my paddle is usually pretty solid. But after a few matches, I started to notice that sometimes the ball would miss the AI paddle, but still reflect back to me. Similarly, sometimes the ball, flying close to the edge of the table, registers a ""hit"" with the sound of a bounce, but doesn't change trajectory, tracing a straight path, often under the table. That said, I'd say 95% of rallies are ""fair"", but that still leaves a 5% wildcard that can ruin a perfectly good match point. Probably the most reproducible issue with collision detection is in ""broken table"" mode, where every rally each hit to the table makes a hole, but not every hit is registered to create a hole (which may be by design, not clear), and sometimes hits to the center of a hole will still bounce the ball (clearly not as intended), rendering that mode mostly unplayable.I do have some other minor quibbles about the AI somehow always playing with a perfectly vertical paddle, and the behavior of spin and smashes, but as it is the game plays very well. Also, the boos after every miss do get a bit grating after the hundredth time.Still, I have loads of fun playing the tournament, even if I was frustratingly destined to fail by the number of weird or miscalculated collisions (only 0.5% of players have beaten it so far). If you can live with a little inconsistency, get this game and support the development of a great game, and hopefully all the little issues will be ironed out. If not, keep this game on your watchlist and come back after an update.			"

								Developer was very nice and sent me a key for this game. Here is my honest review:Pros: Fun 8-Bit artstyle, I haven't really seen any other 8-Bit vive games. Extensive settings menu. Almost everything I was wondering or wanted was an available setting, like throw type or rotation. An abundance of modes to choose from. Practice, Normal, a tournament and 6 arcade modes. As well as difficulty settings. The entire arena shifts and changes when you switch to certain rounds, it looks very cool and dramatic. Nice haptic feedback on the controller. Its subtle, but its still there. A little touch that adds to the immersion just that little bit extra.  I got the game for free, but $5 seems like a pretty reasonable price for this game.Cons: No multiplayer. It seems somewhat essential for this kind of game, but I have no friends with a Vive so it doesn't matter for me specifically. Still, a feature that would be nice. The physics is a bit wonky. If you get adjusted to it its OK, but it is still a little bit intense. If you hit very gently, nothing really happens. If you hit with a little love tap, it goes perfectly. If you swing like you would with real ping pong, it goes flying off to the sides and into the crowd. I got adjusted to it, and I'm not particularly good at normal ping pong anyways, I just wish the ball had a little more mass to it. Easy mode wasn't very easy. It could be chalked off to me being bad at the game, but even with a perfect, fast hit that landed on the corner of their side, they would still often hit it. Either way, this game has a lot of charm and I do see myself returning and playing some more to master my skills.			"

												One of the worst table tennis games out there right now for VR. The developers unfortunately don't seem to understand ping pong physics or do not play semi-professionally. Definitely go for one of the other table tennis games (personally I recommend Eleven Table Tennis VR).Additionally, hasn't been updated for months which indicates an abandoned early access game for me.

Early Access Review
								This is great! The physics are (mostly) brilliant, and it can get quite addictive! One of those games where you lie to yourself, saying ""just one more game"".There are a couple of issues I've experienced which I hope will be addressed:1. Occasionally when you hit the ball it decides you've hit it 2-3 times harder than you were expecting. Not a big issue, as didn't happen often. If it happens a lot for anyone it may be more a tracking issue with the Vive setup than the game.2. Sometimes when the ball misses the edge of the table, it is registered as having hit the table, giving the AI a point. NOTE this is different to when the ball hits the edge and goes off at an angle. That's just true to real life ping pong, but still annoying :P.Only a couple of things I can think to add to this game:1. Some less voxel-based graphics, because it's a repetitive and tiring style now.2. A control to increase intensity of haptic feedback when hitting the ball.For £4, this is a really fun little game.

								The game seems pretty solid with the intention of even more being added. So far, for £3.99 it is easily worth it. It might take a few tries to get used to serving power, but once a rally gets going, it feels pretty natural.I am not an avid ping pong player, so I might not be the best person to ask about realism though.Would recommend.

								This is alot of fun. I played ping pong in my youth and this hit's it. Thee BIGGEST problem is the initial launch of the ping pong ball. This DOES not have to be realistic at all!Don't bother too much with setting the ball location with the trackpad, just place the ball in the center of the paddle.If you want to let players move it anyway:The math for moving the ball seems to be a bit wrong aswell. Since you're on UE4: You might use Set Relative Location from the ball's parent and clamp it to the paddle radius and you basically use the same math as moving a character around with the trackpad. Currently this is very very buggy. Otherwise this is alot of fun and VERY polished for a early access title. Good work guys! :)			"

								Good table tennis simulator with spectators and pretty good ball physics. Took a little time to pick up the right force to use when hitting balls. Also I found the serve a little hard at first and would prefer the 2 controller serve with ball in one hand and bat in other to serve. Edit you can change to 2 hand serve in the settings so you have the choice of either which is great, thanks Dev for the info.Table was good and the Lego like spectators and noise adds to the game, other ping pong games miss this. It's more of a competitive scene than the playing at home of the other ping pong games. Overall a good ping pong game and although I have only that a little time in it due to an injury at the moment. Which is keeping from using the vive, it's pretty easy to see that this game does exactly what's it's supposed to after not much game time. Would hit small balls with a bat again.			"

								A lot of fun! There is a good amount of customization possible in the game. The environment is excellent because of the stadium size, crowd and stats on leaderboards. The game is challenging. A so-so player like me will probably win 1/4 of the volleys. The ball sound is a little to deep/heavy and the bounce sound needs better syncronization. Overall the physics seem pretty good, though some tweaks with ball spin and paddle velocity curve are needed. It would be great if ball weight was something that was customizable becuase having read a lot of reviews on a few pong games, I don't think we can all agree on how hard we should hit the ball. Bottom line is that this game is worth the money.			"

								Can't serve. I mean it. The only way to serve apparently is a negative point for you. The ball just bounces and then disappears.This game needs a lot more documentation and explanation in order to be able to use it.EDIT: I finally figured out what's vexing me. I'm looking for a casual ping pong game to while away the time. I don't worry about making sure to serve from one corner to another, which this game insists on. I wish there was just a mode for us filthy casuals, and yes that includes bouncing it on your side first. I realize this is ultimately a stylistic choice, but this is just not how I've played ping pong.			"

								Was not really impressed, The sound, haptic feedback, and physics in the game has me convinced that I am playing with a bouncy ball instead of a proper ping pong ball. The one handed serve feels unnatural and the two handed serve was again reinforcing that the balls weight somehow seems to heavy. At other times the ball would fly off in a bizare direction from a hit that should not have caused that kind of response. Hopefully the devs can improve on these points and I will be able to update my review.			"

								Absolutely love the game. It's 8 bit style means that there is no lag at any point ever and the ball is clearly visible amongst the background and audience.Nice and simple music adds to the menu which would otherwise be a complete bore. The addition of arcade modes with leaderboards also adds huge amounts of replay ability.However, there is only one problem I have with this game. I have lost possibly hundreds of points by now where the ball will hit/brush against the SIDE of the table (i.e. not on top). This is not considered ""in"" in real table tennis meaning you should get the point, but you don't.Other than that the game is well worth the low price as I feel it is more fun and well made than some of the other more expensive vr titles.
