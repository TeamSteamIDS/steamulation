												{ Bought in a ~$1.50 bundle including a few other titles ; Great value for the money, but these products don't deserve support }It is a generally lazy game sold on the premise of female leads, cleavage and 'indie' factors. I can't think of a single thing to brag about except that they let you change the Window Skin color.Combat is easy, graphics are ugly, maps are lazy, enemies are uninspired and the plot is what an underaged amateur would think would make for an exciting RPGmaker project. Kid, just because the assets are based on medieval Dragon Quest values does not mean you have to let them influence you.{ Mouse Support: Only available at the main menu. Only option is using left click to select something, yet the dev thought it was enough to justify it on the page. }			"

I wanted to like this, but ouch, my eyes.30+ minutes into the game, I had to stop, because the graphics were killing me. The backgrounds (mainly ground tiles) are too jarring - as your character walks, they appear to ""vibrate"" (because of the pattern on them), and it hurts because they are too bright & loud. I was actually getting motion sickness because of the perceived vibration.The same goes for everything else - objects, characters, etc. They are just too ""clashing"". I wish the developer had gone for a ""softer"" style.I never managed to make it to the purported nudity. Boohoo. "

												Despite the multitude of flaws, I've had more fun with this game than a lot of others I've played, however I almost gave up towards the end because the flaws became so tiring. Let's start with visuals.  The character portraits don't match the sprites on the screen, that goes for all the characters.  The main four characters have larger portraits that don't match the art style of the smaller portraits used for other characters and there is only one picture that is used for all dialogue.  This leads to jarring instances where the character is angry or sad but their profile picture is still grinning.  I also found that the game was very loud.  Even setting my headphones as low as they would go I had to go into the settings and lower the audio levels, however this doesn't apply to the title screen.  So when you stop and restart you get blown away by the title screen.I probably would have still recommended the game if it was just the above issues, but it was also very laggy on larger maps (which is most of them) and desperately needed a map for several of the larger area's where it was very easy to get turned around.

												I've played plenty of RPGMaker titles released on steam. Some really good, others completely miserable. This one is neither, but it definitely isn't all that good. That as hardcore completionist I left the side-jobs just to rush the main plot should say enough. Sadly, it didn't really lead to a satisfactory conclusion regardless.So let's sum up why this is one of the ""bad"" RPGMaker games:* Absolutely the worst thing here is the attrocious level design. Narrow ugly unnatural looking mazes. I've never before seen a RPGMaker game with such horrid levels to navigate around and play with. Also the overland map was the most sloppy and amateurish I've seen so far.* Bad combat. 70% of the game exists out of fighting 2 guys who die in 2 hits... with a part of 4. Then the end 20% there's 3 guys that die in 2 hits. Both extremely weak. The other 10% is bosses, which can be stunlocked with ease, making them rather easy hitdumps. Even the final boss. Who for some reason needed to have insta-kill attacks on each hit. So stun or die. Oh joy. Guy has a fairly insane hitpool too.* Some really weird balancing. The wizard character does more damage with the standard attack than any of his spells. Infact, the higher leveled the spell and more mana it takes, the less damage it does. What?* Bad plot and characters. You can see the ""twist"" from a galaxy away, there is no believability for characters (""I'll never join the rebellion!"" ""Please?"" ""Oh, I will join the rebellion, you're so convincing!"". Just way too many forced things ingame to make you scratch  your head. For example the final boss had a big speech about not caring for you and not wanting to fight you etc... and then after the long monologue it goes ""Oh, I'm going to kill you anyway""... HELLO? And that was more rule than exception.* Some slacky polish which stands out like blue/red flags being important then seeing a whole enemy camp in your flag color immediately AFTER the whole color conversion (*sigh*), people standing on chairs, moonwalking mining, bartenders asking you for a drink and not selling anything. Overall, it felt sloppy.But I guess it does have some good things going for it:* Low price* NO random enemies. Thank god. Running past most boring combat was very helpful too.* Generally citizens updated their conversations based on your actions, aside from some exceptions which are probably due to the sloppy execution.

												While I wanted to like the game, I can't recommend it. The game feels incomplete and is very buggy as could be seen when I streamed the game. As such, I won't give my normal style of review but instead a pro and con list type review.Pros:Avoidable enemies. (This also means that you have to leave the area in order to respawn enemies). This does get annoying later when you eventually get sick of fighting trash mobs that have a 50% evade rate on top of your own miss rate. Unlike other games where you can have an item or ability to remove/move mobs, the enemies here will often pursue you or simply block your path.Plenty of sidequestsSome NPCs change their generic convo text after big story events.Quest system makes it easy to know what quest to do. Unfortunately, the quests are not sorted so it can be rather cluttered by the end.Things to note that are both Pros and Cons:Main characters have semi-full (no feet) portraits. This is a pro in and of itself, but as most characters only have small square portraits, this looks odd.Sparkles let the player know where to interact. This also means that a lack of sparkles means there is no interaction (excluding NPCs and chests which do not sparkle). This is great in the sense that players don't have to check everything, but the sparkles are white... and there is a white snow map.The game can be completed 100% in about 6 hours on the hardest difficulty, not 13+. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but isn't necessarily a good thing. On the easiest difficulty, the game can be finished in about 4 hours or possibly less.Chandeliers. While a nice thought, they really look odd being attached to nothing.Cons: Feels unfinished in a rushed to finish sort of way.Bartenders tell you to order stuff or to be wary of ordering certain things, but you can't buy anything from bartenders.Final town has MANY areas with doors that say nothing on interaction AND can't be entered.Final town has many NPCs with no convo text, including a bartender.Really odd layout for many maps, including most areas and the final town.Random shadows in a game that generally lacks shadows except for objects that have shadows as part of their image. Most of the game's terrain (even including towns) lack shadows. However, randomly, you will see shadows that are just there and often do not match the terrain they are coming from.VERY buggy and full of issues.If your main character gets confused and does a multihit on itself, it will freeze the game if it dies before the multihit is over. Not sure what happens in other situations as I was essentially forced to not allow it to be confused ever again.Many areas have bad pathing issues. Whether from invisible walls or from walls that can be ignored and walked through.Several enemies flicker as the game is confused on whether to render them or to disable them, forcing them to flicker on and off.At least one enemy object has issues where the game does not know what layer to draw the object on, causing overlapping objects to flicker as the game tries to map the background objects on top.Very noticeable lag in certain areas, especially large ones due to the rendering of large water sources without any optimization.One sidequest seems to be missable due to a bug changing how one of the events work.The game starts in fullscreen mode even with the ""fullscreen mode"" option unchecked. The F1 options cannot be easily interacted with as the game hides the mouse, forcing the player to use the keyboard to control the menu.Mouse control does not exist except in very specific menu windows.Lacks full controller support despite the store page stating it has full controller support. Overall, it lacks noticeable controller support. Tried to play the game with only a controller, did not work.Horrid balancing. The wizard's skills are essentially useless. The wizard does more damage with a normal attack.SPI in general is useless except on the healer, even then...The healer's skills are effectively unnecessary for most boss battles.The main character's paralyze lock is near necessary for boss battles, especially the end boss.The paralyze lock works on all bosses, making the healer skills and wizard's debuff skill effectively useless.The secondary dps/buffer's skills essentially make the healer's remove stat down skill useless.Most accessories are useless, especially early elemental boss drops as the rings make you resist the elemental boss you just beat...Most of the difficulty lies in the absurdly high dodge rate of the enemies. Even if you don't miss, they can still evade your attack and it seems like the enemies evade much more often than your characters to the point that the 1/20 miss chance and 1/20 evade chance seems more like 1/2 miss chance and 1/2 evade chance at times.And more...I am going to end it there. While I mostly enjoyed the game, there are just too many negative points for me to recommend the game. Also, why does the game have the name ""Storm of Spears"" when no character in the game uses spears? Even the title image shows a sword. Speaking of which, who is the title character? The main character dual wields swords and has brown hair and white clothing. The title character has blonde hair and one sword and bronze colored clothing.			"

												Bland sums this game up well, the characters are flat, the story is standard, the combat is bland and simple. The only thing going for it is some of the graphics look okay.			"

												Eh. Plot is predictable. Game is ♥♥♥♥ easy. There's no nudity like promised and the protagonist is a hypocrite with lines such as ""I don't want no more bloodshed."" To ""Ha! I love it when they say that!"" In response to a knight saying he won't surrender and would rather die.Eh all the way through. Again, don't buy unless you want easy achievements and steam cards.

												Storm Of Spears is yet another line of RPG Maker games that's made with the default sets (With the exception of the ""Face"" and some ""Picture"" sets.) Some of the music, sounds, animations, attacks, all are from the default RTP. This is yet another example of someone who,although did put some time into the ""Faces"", but did design their own maps, characters, and music.The game itself isn't too bad, I have seen a LOT worse than this game. At least with this game, some of the exits and teleports are clear. (Although it still needs a little more work) There's also a few areas where sometimes the NPC's walk around in a spot where you can't get around unless you wait for a good minute or so for them to randomly walk to a spot where you can leave. (Case in point, as you leave the building at the very beginning, a dog will block your way, sure I could go around the other way, but the way I want to go is faster.)I do like the combat system that was used, so there is that. Basic ""Final Fantasy"" style combat where you actually see the action. Some of the monsters are a bit original so there is also that.I only real advice I would like to give to the devs is that the game could use a bit more ""obvious"" exits as it can get a bit frustrating sometimes when you been through 10 locations, only to go back to the start and you suddenly forgot where the exit to the place was.Please keep in mind I got this as a freebe from one of the Groups I joined, so although I can't complain about this game too much, I am not going to give all ""thumbs up"" just because it was given to me as a gift. Understand, not complaining about ""FREE"", but the game needs a bit more work.Some other things to also keep in mind...1.) It was obviously made with RPG Maker XP, not VX or MV2.) Graphics could have been worked on a little more3.) From what I was told, was suppose to have mouse support, but didn't seem to work while I was playing4.) Really? Adult content? Is this really necessary?5.) The game sometimes has issues between full screen and windowed mode6.) Since this was made on RPG Maker XP, this game will work the best on a Windows XP7.) This game could have been worked on a little bit better			"

My playtime: 06:08:16 (based on in game clock, casual difficulty, before fighting the final boss).Grindy Achievement: No.Optional Achievement: No.Difficult Achievement: No.Developer Response: ~24h (on selected threads).IntroStorm Of Spears RPG is a RPG game (duh) made in RPG Maker. Although there is a warning about inappropriate content, the only inappropriate thing in this game is the characters' lack of clothing (which can be seen in the screenshots). The game itself tells the story about a group of mercenaries which are trying to do a rebellion against a kingdom.MusicI'm not sure whether the music is from the default RPG Maker asset, but i do know that some of them are. They are used appropriately, however.GraphicsAgain, i'm not really sure whether they are using default RPG Maker asset, but i do believe that most of them are using the default asset. The character portrait doesn't seem like using a default asset, although that maybe the reason why the character portrait seems to be different from the sprite, especially their height.The mapping looks lazily done; most of them are placed inappropriately, especially the no-wall section in some dungeons, which looks more like a ""pitfall"". Even if there is a wall, the wall is like a few tiles away from the floor. The mapping is also using two tiles for a chair (which is not passable) which makes you have to circle around to go to the place that you want.The battle screen's background is also off; I mean, in most of the backgrounds, the character looks like standing in an obstacle. While i'm at it, there is this odd line where the ""xxx attacks"" message lefts out after each attack.Aside from the mappings, the graphic fits perfectly for low screen resolution. The game can be changed to full screen to make the graphic looks blurred.The UI looks like a default one, although i have to complaint about the quest menu which will close the menu when you are pressing X instead of going to the main menu.Lastly, the text placement seems to be off; sometimes, the sentence ends in the middle of the dialogue box, sometimes, it fits the dialogue box, and sometimes, the sentence looks cropped (due to the dialogue box's length).StoryI think i'll just be blunt with this. I don't understand the prologue at all. You are catching someone out of nowhere which turns out to be a leader of a rebels because you are a group of mercenaries hired by someone. After that, it showed that you are in a troublesome kingdom with an unfit ruler which you plan to overthrow.The MC doesn't look have much resolve at first, although i don't really see any character development on her. She just looks like following the turns of events and somehow made her place at the end. There is also this outstandingly smart little brother which looks like a child to me. The party's background story are explained, although not in detail, and there is also no character development for them except on one side quest.However, the story keeps on focusing on its main mission without being distracted on some other places. The story concludes greatly and all the events are flowing smoothly.The gameThe first thing that i want to address is how my cursor is always staying behind the game and how i can't exit the game by clicking X (close) button in the game window.The game starts after you choose one out of three difficulties, with casual being the easiest, normal, and hard. After that, the game will start until you can control your character. For those who are not used with RPG Maker games, there is a short text tutorial about the controls after that.Although the game has different difficulties, i think that those are scaled weirdly. I only play casual difficulty and while the enemies can be hard to kill (take around 2-3 hits to kill one of them, although there are 3-4 enemies in a battle), the bosses are no different from normal enemies except for a more hp and a more damaging attack (except for the last boss which has a one hit kill skill). I can kill them in a few turns except for two enemies (the last boss and an optional boss, namely the Dark Lord because i fight them in low level at that time).You'll start with a four person party of an attacker, a healer, a buffer (and a strong attacker), and a magic user. However, i have to say that the classes are unbalanced. The MC, being an attacker in the game, is way too strong compared to the magic user. There is this OP skill which slash the enemies thrice which will have a tremendous damage if she got her attack boosted (which is a piece of cake with the buffer's skill). The mage hardly can use any useful magic and can even deal a higher damage by attacking rather than doing a magic skill. There are also skills which will be learned after they reach a particular level. Note that the damage dealing skills can only be learned by the attacker and the mage.The game keeps track of its quest in a log which can be accessed from the main menu. The quest differentiates between side quest and main quest with an icon. However, some of the quest has a wrong icon, while there is one quest which has no icon at all. However, the quest is very simple and easy to follow with the quest log.This game has a few dungeons which is designed perfectly. I do enjoy getting lost in dungeons and this game really helps me fulfill that desire. I'm getting lost several times in the dungeon because of the big map. However, having a big map also means more monster. Luckily, there is no random encounter in the game and the enemy won't respawn unless you leave the area. The only downside is the last town, Ironhorn, which is so big that i keep on getting lost in there.There are some weapon and armor seller in some towns, although you'll get the equipment from somewhere else most of the times. The equipments are also cheap (less than 100g) which make the items look way more expensive.When you are almost finished the game, you'll receive a dragon mount. However, you have to go one tile below the dragon to ride it.Pros:- 3 difficulties to select from- Easy to follow quest log- Greatly designed dungeon- No random encounterCons:- Unbalanced class- Lazily done mappingsConclusionThis is a RPG Maker game about mercenaries which turns to be rebels. There are no inappropriate scenes in this game except the characters' lack of clothing.Should you buy this game?No.I bought this game as a part of JRPG Happiness Love Bundle which contains other games in a cheap price, but seeing that the bundle isn't here anymore, i can't really recommend the game because the game seems to be lazily done.I mean, there are a lot of better free RPG Maker games out there although it's not in steam which obviously doesn't have achievements and trading cards.However, if you just want to play an easy to finish RPG Maker game, you can buy this game. Without the bundle, it's actually pretty cheap when it's on a discount. "

												It alright. It not nuanced or subtle. It tasteless and lukewarm. But it alright.To be more serious, it should not be surprising that only 4.7% of players even made it through the whole game.In spite of the 9.8 hours my Steam shows, I managed to beat the whole game in 5 hours and 41 minutes. The game is obscenely easy, especially when you take into account the Stun attack and 3x Random attack the protagonist gets. Add the low damage/high armor issue enemies have to face, and I found myself never losing a single battle. When your final boss has to stoop to Almighty max damage and instant kill spells in order to harm you, there's something broken about your difficulty.The story was average at best. You take control of a mercenary group that joins a rebellion to overthrow a tyrannical ruler. And that just about does it for the story, since everything else is a cliche and overused trope, with little effort to make things different. The things they do differently are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly out of nowhere, such as a particular scene involving a meeting I won't spoil.The characters are okay. You've got bland heroine with storymode charisma, Batman healer who's aggressive and stupid because his family was killed, generic last survivor, and old guy who drinks and keeps complaining that he's old. If those don't sound like the perfect group to tag along with, then you're gonna have a boring time.Though if you want me to get angry, I've got a few things to say about this company and their deceitful advertising. First thing's first, the blonde chick shown on the advertising image and intro screen? Doesn't appear even once in the game. Second, The genres chosen for this game are Sexual Content, Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie, Racing, RPG, Simulation, Sports, and Strategy. I can tell you now that this game is Casual, an RPG, and possibly Indie, but is none of these other genres. The game has no mature content, amd there are zero Nudity or Sexual scenes in this game. This reeks of deception for profit, and makes me unable to recommend this.Honestly, I don't even remember why I bought this game. I only lost about 50 cents, but I kinda wish I had it back, considering the mediocre experience I got. It alright, but I will probably never play this game again.			"
