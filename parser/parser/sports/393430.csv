												Good game. As an ice fisherman myself, I can say that it is exactly what it says it is... Ice Fishing. I think the graphics are OK for what it is, the gameplay is good, and I'm enjoying my time with it so far.One downside is that there is no tutorial (at least that I noticed). Meaning, if you don't know ice fishing already, you could be lost. Some simple instructions would go a long way. A couple of tips for starters: You need to run out on the lake, pick a spot, drill a hole with your auger, BAIT your hook/jig (there are grubbs that go on the hook or you won't catch anything). You can vary your depth using your mouse wheel (where I live, slightly off the bottom is where you fish, but other depths can work). There is a strainer next to the hole to keep ice out of the hole (click on it, I think I caught more fish when the hole was clear). Watch the end of the pole, when you get a hit, hit the F button on your keyboard or use the reel icon on the screen to pull up the line. Lastly, there is a bait shop near where you started for bait, etc. and when the time is running down, get back to that area to have your score count! Not exactly ""review"" material, but I hope this is some help to you.All in all, a good ice fishing game that I'd recommend to a friend. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet...			"

												First off, its not bass or ocean fishing, its important to keep that in mind when playing it. Ice fishing is not fast paced or about the fights, its about the right lure in the right location.Graphics could be better but honestly they are better then alot of other $12 games out there. Animation motions are smooth and did not experience any clipping issues.Multi-player is a fun idea, seeing others running around digging holes and jumping spot to spot on the ice.The sounds in the game are accurate and good.Did not seem to be drawing anything from my second video card but the game ran very smooth with no crashes or hang-ups.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fishing, we dont have enough fishing games out there to pick from and to the collectors of group multiplayer games.

												Is it the most realistic ice fishing game? Definitely not. Is it fun? Absolutely! Especially when played with friends over voice chat.The devs have assuredly played Pro Pilkki before, since there are quite a lot of similarities in the game mechanics and that is not a bad thing. For years Pro Pilkki has been the best ice fishing game out there and it's really a time for it to have some competition. Does Ice Lakes provide the competition? I'd like to think so. It has it's ups and downs but over time this game could take the spot as #1 ice fishing game, assuming the devs will provide updates and fixes to it.Ice Lakes is still fresh out of the oven and that can be seen, especially on the multiplayer front. Hosting a game / being able to join a friends game can be quite a pain in the buttocks. Setting a password or lowering the max players value don't seem to have an affect. But once you get going, it's really fun and I'm  optimistic that these small problems will be fixed in coming updates.If you are expecting realism, then you might be a bit disappointed. The fish weights and amount of fish you are able to catch can seem quite absurd at times. 1.2kg ruffe.. that's something I'd like to see IRL ;) If you are up for some arcade ice fishing, then this game is definitely something to try out!5/5, will recommend!

												This is the best thing after ProPilkki 2.I just love how they captured the essence of ice fishing and all the little things that comes with it.This will be a hit on our LAN parties. Just take a few beers, fire up the multiplayer and check who is the Pilkkikuningas!I highly recommend to all of you fishing fans that either already know the world of ice fishing or who want to step away from luke warm waters and wear some warm clothes.Drill that ice like a mother fisher!

												Ice Lakes is exactly what I hoped it to be: a modernized version of popular ice fishing games. You can finally go ice fishing in 3D. Ice Lakes keeps the focus in fishing and there is more customization than in the previous ice fishing games I have played: you can change different hooks to your jigs or you can drop some baits in the water to lure a specific fish a bit better. Meanwhile you can scoop off the ice from your fishing hole. These little things really improve the atmosphere. You can upgrade your gear in the shop after you have earned some money from the games.It is also noteworthy that the developers in Ice Flake Studios are listening the community and applying hotfixes fast. The biggest problem I found was that fishes' weight was too high, but a hotfix for this was applied on the next day. There is still some tuning in fishes' weight but it is already ALOT better.I actually sent the developers an e-mail where I asked about future plans and I listed some suggestions that I personally hoped to see in the game. On the next day I got an answer from one of the developers where he took the time to separately answer all of my questions. For example online stats are in the to do -list, as well as adding information of current lake's species so you can see them while fishing. I also said that at the moment it is too easy to reel in bigger fishes and developer answered that they are currently working to improve this, and this should be one of the first improvements they are applying.All in all I would recommend this game for everyone who likes fishing or fishing games in general. Lets face it, there really is not enough fishing games so Ice Lakes is a very welcome addition.Lastly some tips I suggest:- I am fishing holding down ""Mouse 1"", moving the mouse trying to lure the fish. You can reel in the fish pressing ""F"" or moving the mouse to the top of your screen and releasing ""Mouse 1"". I changed the ""F"" key to ""Space"" so it is possible to just hit the keyboard to reel in your catch.- If you want to hunt for the biggest fish or you prefer the ocean maps, I suggest you save your money for the heaviest equipment to be able to catch them.- I changed to third person and preferred that immediatly. Using ""WASD"" to move is the most convenient.- If you can not catch any fish, try scrolling your mouse to try from a different depth.			"

												Love this simulator! Being from Northern Minnesota I'm a huge ice fisherman and when I don't have time to get out this is a fun way to get my fix. Multiple lakes, ponds and rivers to try and fish along with a plethra of different fish species (half I've never even heard of but that's becauese they're European fish species). So far it's a pretty simple game. I like to compare fishing to golf, a day to learn and a lifetime to master. I think I've had more luck just using a baitless balanced lure over the baited types as long as you are jigging like a madman the fish seem to come flyin up the hole (assuming you found a good spot). Graphics leave a bit more to be desired and I have no idea what the point of the jump feature is but it's there. I've never had much urge to try any VR but this game makes me want to. Some funny points:-The animation is a bit on the basic side but for $15 what can you expect. -I would pay to watch someone take off at a full sprint wearing a snowsuit, carrying a hand auger/drill, all their fishing gear, a chair and whatever fish they've caught (sometimes 20+) running all around a lake like Usain Bolt. If you've ever ice fished you know that equipment isn't exactly light. Your character must be a well conditioned, finely tuned athlete to sprint a mile, hand auger 10-20 holes and carry all that equipment. Just cracks me up.-The wildlife running around on the lake is a funny addition. I've read there's apparently a bear somewhere in this game as well.Cons:-Online mode. When I looked for online action the 3 servers offered were all empty. However, if you have a few friends that own this you can set up a tournament for all of you to play in.-Music. This game could really use more than the one 15 second loop that will drive you insane if listened to too long. Also reminds me ALOT of Golf with my Friends music.Being a pureblood Minnesotan I've been ice fishing ever since I was a wee lad. Here I am at 29 years old still doing it whenever I get a chance. However, there are many days I just don't have time to make it out on the lakes so when this was brought to my attention I was immediately interested. I was hesitant to buy this but the large majority of the reviews seemed positive and it happened to go on sale for $10 while watching it so I decided to pull the trigger. This game has yet to disappoint and already provided me more entertainment than I anticipated. So I highly suggest this to anyone who enjoys some simple ice fishing or has never tried it even.Side note: My brother came up with what I thought would be a funny idea for my Live-stream and to get a VR setup outside in the Northern MN elements... Sit outside in the real cold winter weather while fishing for fake fish. Really want to do that once haha.			"

												Ice Lakes is simple but a lot of fun. Although many other fishing games have fancy features and stuff, I find myself coming back to Ice Lakes all the time just for a casual, relaxing, and enjoyable fishing time. This is especially awesome since I stream on Twitch and my viewers also love to watch this game as much as I enjoy playing it. :) One great thing about it is the game supports multi players which allows friends to fish together! Please keep up the good work!			"

												Havent played this game alot but i can give my impressions of it so far. Small file size which is great ! The games graphics are beautiful , and it runs really smooth. I have not encountered any game bugs or glitchs so far. The achievements and in-game achievements are great. Only downfall is your ice fishing a hole the whole game lol!!! I still find myself playing so i can get all the high lvl items. This game is worth the money and it isnt harsh on your system at all. It's just as fun on single player as it is on multiplayer. The tournaments are good , and the types of tournaments are great as well. I would tell anyone to buy this if you like games , fishing games , or games with decent graphics. You can always stop playing and come back to it when you feel like it.			"

												The interface IS a bit unintuitive at first. Initially, I was ""THIS CLOSE"" to asking for a refund, but - wanting a relaxing game experience - I stuck with it. Note: Long tournaments and short competitions are NOT actually relaxing. But free-fishing is digital zen.I haven't ice-fished (in real life) for decades, but it was something I loved doing when I was a kid. Sigh, nostalgia... So, I gave this game another shot. After maybe an hour of play, I began to figure things out. The equipment you purchase (with in-game cash earned by catching fish, by winning competitions and tournaments) makes a HUGE difference to your success. This is not instant gratification - its a slow burn.I am 40 hours into the game now, and I haven't yet explored a third of what it offers. While I might not always win - I always feel that my failures are my fault, and not because of the RNG. This is a game that I feel I can play for years. Go back to that old map... try this bait... catch that slightly bigger fish... break my record...I will admit that it is hard to get a grasp on the controls in the beginning - it is not very intuitive out of the gate. But Ice Lakes IS worth taking your time with. AND... I just caught a 32 lb sturgeon so WOOHOO! YAY ME!10/10 Will buy games made in Finland again.			"

												I found this game to be more engaging than I thought. I was expecting to be mildly entertained for a little while. I was hooked. (pun intended) and spent some time into the wee hours of the morning playing 'just one more tournament'. Despite the typos in the guide, its very well done and easy to understand. If a game can keep me up until 2am in the morning, I say its a success. 10/10 Would land that big one again.			"

Ice Lakes ReviewIce Lakes is a great ice fishing simulator which tests the player's patience.  I've never been a fan of sim games myself, but this game had its own niche and I felt like a real fisherman, albeit a terrible one.Gameplay 8/10Ice Lakes, like any other simulator, cannot be judged like any other game.  The game itself makes players feel like a real fisherman, but moments after jumping into my first session, I realised that the game had no tutorial.  Instead, the beginner's guide to fishing was featured in the tournament category.  Why they decided new players would want to go straight into a tournament hoping to find a tutorial there is beyond my concern, but it was confusing nonetheless.  I was left wandering in the dark, blindly drilling my holes around the lake hoping to catch more fish.Ice Lakes is a game which requires patience, the player must attentively wait and watch the fishing pole for any sign of movement, then race to haul the fish up.  This process was unexpectedly entertaining and I was ecstatic to catch my first ever flounder.The game allows players to wander the map to drill holes in lakes for fish, then run back to the stall to sell the fish for profit.  The issue with this system was that I was unsure of when I should be returning to the stall due to the absence of a tutorial, and the fish didn't net me as much money as I had hoped.  The upgrades in this game seem to be ridiculously expensive and I would like to see the prices of bait or new fishing rods be lowered to give the palyer a sense of progression in the game, instead of the failure of a fisherman I see myself as.  Visuals/Style 7/10Pretty standard, it's exactly what the store page shows so no false advertising.  The only exception is that the game isn't actually third person, as one of the pictures would want the player to believe.  The game is completely top down for the most part, and first-person when fishing.  This is what you should be expecting going into this game.Story/Lore N/AN/APros+Satisfaction when successfully catching a fish+Beautiful snowy environment+A plethora of maps+Nice soundscape, tranquil and perfect for fishing+Online function is available+Very fishyCons-Very slow progression-Ill-placed beginner's guide-Online servers are unpopulated-Very fishyVerdict: 15/20, an entertaining ice lake fishing simulator packed with variety (of fish) and content.

												Living in NJ I don't get to fish fish. Too far away to really enjoy it. BUT, with Ice Lakes I can sit at my desk in the warmth of my house and fish all day!. So on these cold winter days when I can't get outside to do much anyways I can pour a warm cup of coffee and play a couple rounds of Ice Lakes. Now if you hate fishing games you are gonna hate this. But if you are a fisherman like I am it is something you will love. Challenging and fun it makes for a great relaxing gaming experience. Kid friendly and parent approved. I am looking forward to competing online against actual opponents.			"

												This game has charm by the bucket load. It's one of those relaxing games you can play with a podcast playing in the background. Something to unwind but yet still provide a challenge. I know nothing about fishing, but yet became engrossed from the very first second. The game is easily accessible. Graphics pleasant and capture the atmosphere well. Simple tutorials are in place and already there are plenty of features to have fun with. Hopefully these will be added to in the near future. This game is a real winner, something a little different. I picked this game up for £7 in a sale and would have been happy to pay full price,May I say 'well done' to the developer, a totally enjoyable game that is also relaxing and fun. I hope you continue to add features.If you're looking for something that makes a change from hacking and slashing monsters, or driving as fast as possible, or your tired of hurting your brain thinking of your next strategic move. This is the refreshing change you're after.			"

												Story time. I hear laughter from behind me. My wife found me sitting in the corner of my guest room, facing away from my monitors at almost the edge of my play space. I had been playing the game for what seemed like an eternity, although it had only been 10 minutes (according to her). I occasionally felt my dogs nuzzle me outside in the real world, but that was normal. She asked me what I was doing. ""I'm ice fishing in a duck pond outside some major city.""/pause""Oh, ok.""She presumably walks off puzzled, now imagining she just experienced something akin to interrupting a 5 year old during playtime. This is one of the funnest and most relaxing virtual reality games I have yet to play. You can sit there, on the ice, fishing to your heart's content - how can something so simple be so awesome? Oh, and if you want you can even fish with friends/strangers. One of my new favorite Vive games!			"

Initially it was very frustrating due to lack of information for even the bare basics. Yes, they have a Steam guide but this information is only barely enough to get you started. Some basics should be explained; What is the difference between the various types of jigs? What are some basic pole motions I can use for some jigs? What's the difference betweent he identically described drills? However, once you get past some of these initial stumbling blocks the game is a lot of fun (if you're into this kind of thing.) I really enjoyed the dual progression of getting more gear to help me win tournaments easier and learning more about the various type of fish and how to catch them to make me a stronger contender. This may not be the type of game you spend 20+ hours on in a week but I do feel it's a good one to keep installed as you can come back to it from time to time for a good 10-60+ minute tournament to do some relaxing ice fishing.

==========================================================Ice Lakes is a single- and multi-player ice fishing game.It includes ten different maps and a number of different game types, but really they all boil down to catching the most fish of certain types within the time limit.==========================================================
----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------
==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are pretty good, with convincing snow-covered scenery and frozen lakes, and some nice additional touches like rabbits and foxes, cabins, rowboats moored on the frozen shores, etc, to maintain the atmosphere. Player character models aren't great when zoomed in up close (such as when selecting your character), but when playing they look okay, and are animated quite well.There's a reasonable list of graphics options in case you're playing on an under-powered PC. I played in full HD with everything turned on on a four-year-old gaming laptop, and didn't encounter any performance problems, even after alt-tabbing a number of times.Sound - Sounds are very simple, but appropriate enough. I found myself playing with some ambient electronic music of my own in the background to fill in the silence, but that's just me.Gameplay - Ice Lakes is all about ice fishing, so the gameplay involves drilling holes in the ice, baiting your hook, lowering it through the hole into the water below, and wiggling it around until you catch a fish. There's no tutorial or guide included in the game, but after a couple of minutes of experimentation I had the basics down pat, and from there it was just trial and error to try to work out where and how to catch the most and largest fish.The game includes 10 different maps, and you're able to select from a number of different goals or game types for each map, including a 'free play' option. I used the free play option to learn the basics, but really there's no reason you can't do that after jumping straight into one of the other game types instead.The other game types involve you competing against a group of other ice fisherman for the specified time, with the winner being the one who catches the most of the specified types and returns to the starting area within the allowed time. I don't know enough about ice fishing in general, or the advanced tactics of Ice Lakes itself, to know if the other computer-controlled characters are acting intelligently, but they're fun to watch and the competition is a welcome addition over free mode. Online multiplayer is an option that I've not yet tried. I believe it plays exactly the same as the single player game, but with your competitors controlled by real people.  Pre-set tournaments are also included and involve playing consecutive competitive levels one after another.As well as the map assortment, the game keeps you busy with the included achievements, many different types of fish, and a whole host of fishing gear to buy with the cash earned from selling your fish at the market in the starting area.==========================================================
-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------
==========================================================Pros:+ Pretty good graphics overall, with interesting environments that look quite pretty+ Attention to detail is good, with a number of little touches for good effect+ Enthusiastic and responsive developers on the Steam forums for the game+ Achievements, to give you something more to aim for+ Trading cardsCons:- It can get a bit boring; some random events, such as cracks in the ice, have been suggested in the forums, and would be a welcome addition==========================================================
--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------
==========================================================I've never been ice fishing in my life, and the topic doesn't interest me that much. That said, however, I found Ice Lakes a fairly relaxing and moderately enjoyable game to play.It's a game for a niche market, but I believe it fills that niche well, and leaves me with really nothing to complain about. I'd recommend it for anyone into ice fishing, or anyone interested in playing something a bit different.7/10For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!

												Maybe it's because I'm not a fisherman that I struggled to gel with this title.  It looks nice and no doubt others will love it.  I found the interface a bit unintuitive as well as the real goal of the game.  Sorry.			"

												I remember the days when I was out there myself - the long days in the cold, cold African glaciers, wearing nothing but a pair of Adidas Air Jordan Hiking Boots™ and a tank top sewn by my late grand mother. I would sit there for hours, completely still, waiting for my prey. I remember it like it was yesterday - I caught the Eel out of the corner of my eye as it sat there, under the ice - taunting me. But was I affected? No. I was as still as ever; waiting for the right moment. The Eel, that I had lovely named ""Eel"", obviously thought I had frozen to death as he started moving towards my perfectly placed ice fishing hole. I watched him get closer and closer, still staying completely unmoving. Eel crept along carefully and as soon as I saw the little trickster's nose - that was it. I lunged forward, using all of my preserved strength - I dove into the water and grappled the eel around it's neck immidietly strangling him.I thought that was the end - but oh, was I wrong. Only hours after the strangling took place, me still holding fast around the eel's neck, to make sure it was completely strangled and also dead - his friends came. A hugh murder of eels (a group of eels is called a 'murder', I know because I am the king of eel fishing and sorts) came out of the dark, dark waters and attacked me. It only took seconds for them to knock me unconscious and bring me back to their lair. They kept me there for six and and half years.When I finally managed to escape their inprisonment, through the help of a fantasticly helpful man, who said his name was 'Captain Bingo', the first thing I did was to log onto my Steam account and look for a new cool game. The first game I saw was ""Barbie & The Revenge of the Clubhouse"" but I had already played it. The next one was this one; ""ICE LAKES"" and I immedietly got massive PTSD of the time when I got caught by a viscious group of eels. (Want to read that story? I have a book coming out soon).I soon recovered though, bought and installed the game and I can honestly say, as I person who obviously knows his way around a fishing pole and/or rod that this game is quite realistic. There is snow, which is usually a sight that you see while you go ice fishing (which is not actually an activity where you fish ice, but you actually fish for regular fish just in an icy environment). There are also several types of fishes and even a type of eel. I'd have liked too see all the different types of eels, because there are definately a few of them - almost five to be more exact, they are; The Siberian Swanktail, The British Eelfish, The French Fisheel-eel, The Pan-American destructive dongus and the wildly disputed West Canadian Winterveil which some delusioned people actually think is a form of undersea Golden Retriever variant.Otherwise, the game is solid. There are quite a few friendly Finnish people on it - they might be a bit shy and reserved, but as soon as you get them on your side, they'll be your friend for life.That's cool.			"

												(Only for VR)No fish fight in VR. It’s very dull to pull fish without any fight and it’s not fair because non-VR users spend about 2 min. to catch fish while VR users spend 5 sec. to catch same kind of fish. "

The game was given to me for review purposesI am not fan of fishing myself and this is the reason why I won't be playing much more of the game, but I can totally see why people who are into the sport would enjoy their time in the beautiful snowy world of Ice Lakes.Ice Lakes is a slow-paced competitive fishing game.The game is not exactly realistic and definitely isn't a simulator in my opinion but if worked as a great time killer for me.Sadly there is no tutorial but the statistics menu helped me start out .The main menu is user friendly, there is no lacking of important graphic/ video and audio settings and the game runs well overall.Of course you are able to customize your character and your tools progressing through the game using the money you earned by beating the computer or other players in several different game modes.The shop system is balanced.Overall everything seems fine from a fishing noobies perspective.The game is obviously made by fans of the sport for fans of the sport and I completely understand and respect that . 100% recommended for fishermen who are too lazy to go out!

												11/22/2016 Update:  When Ice Lakes VR was released, the game was literally just a 3D experience with a HMD and Vive controller as basically a mouse pointer.  I re-purchased the game to give it another shot based on the latest update.  The developers did a great job in moving toward a true VR experience.  From the very moment you select a spot on the ice, you manually drill the hole.  You can move items around and manually scoop out the ice which I was expecting when I first purchased the game.  I didn't catch it my first play through but they also added a fish fight feature which is disabled by default.  In addition to the variations in vibration intensity based on fish size, you now can be prompted to lift the controller at certain points while reeling in the fish which is a nice touch.  I am changing my view to ""recommend"" as this is no longer just a 3D version of a gamepad style game and the efforts making this more immersive experience you could expect from a VR ice fishing game is appreciated.  I made an updated gameplay video of this game to show the new features:

Original Review:I purchased this game for a VR experience not knowing anything else about the game.  As a fishing game I'm sure it's fine but as a VR experience not so much.  Since this was for the HTC Vive, I thought there would be more immersion.  The bottom line is one controller is a mouse with laser pointer and the other is just a way to move the pole with motion and press buttons to control your reel.  Even with the goofy Gear VR game ""Bait!"" you have to hold tension on the line and release a bit if it gets too much tension to successfully reel in the fish.  In this game you tap the tigger once to drop the line, and tap the trigger once it vibrates to reel it in.  There is no immersion or technique what-so-ever.  So again, the only reason I'm not recommending this game is for the VR expereince/expectations.  The game by itself for a non-VR expereince is fine for what it is in my opinion.
