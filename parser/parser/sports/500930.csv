												No... Just dont...Unless its sometime in the future when this game is updated...Right now you cant throw the ball properly... just falls out of your hand when you reach back...  See what I mean here if you like...

			Football VR is a small game that was released recently. Its basically a minigame where you throw footballs through rings to get points. The futher the ring the more points you get.

												Sorry to the developer, but this game is just garbage (and to be fair I doubt he/she spent much longer developing it than I spent playing it).  The physics are terrible - no matter which direction you turn, the ball always points in the same direction, the ball floats through the air no matter what, and it doesn't even attempt things like requiring a spiral.  Plus, it's buggy.  If you bring your arm back too far for your throw, you automatically drop it.  Really, really bad.  I wasted my dollar, but nobody else should.			"
