												Well this game is pretty much a simpler football manager.Pros:-Ratings for player is really simple, simple enough for most people to understand the game.-It has most of the players and the popular teams.-If you've played soccer manager before in their website, this is mostly the same game as that.-There's a single player and a multiplayer experience.-You can (slowly, depending on how much you win) earn points to earn SM credit. (SM credit is what you can buy with real money to help you in the game)-Best of all this game is free to play.Cons:-The developers took steps back in the development of the game like how you can't make customs formations anymore and that player info pages doesn't open a pop-up menu.-Confusing login screen.-Needs some cool music.

												Welcome to ""Soccer Manager 2016"" where the score is made up, and the points don't matter! Please keep in mind that the negativity of this review is 99% because of the f2p shop and the Facebook integration, I even praise what the game has to offer for fans of the genre, otherwise.  Review continues below.

The points don't matter because you can just buy them for hideous amounts of REAL cash in the f2p cash shop! Seriously, if you ignore the cash shop's existence, and the mandatory (!!!) Facebook login, this seems like it would be a really in-depth, enjoyable simulator for fans of the genre. But that's all contradicted and trumped by the fact that you can literally buy your way to victory. Realstic sim + buying victories? Those two things don't go together well.			"

												For someone who is used to play free soccer/football management games this is one is quite outstanding but needs some proper fixes.Reasons to play *For a free game this one isn't filled with ads to buy coins/credits/whatever. Ofcourse they ask for it from time to time but it isn't annoying at all. *The structure of the game is simple and you can see this as a pro. After a time you know exactly what you're doing and how to behave.*it has real clubs and leagues. CL and EL too. Reasons to stay away  *As I said before it needs to fix the bugs etc. For example: It doesn't matter how many players you have on your loan list,    clubs don't ask for them at all. This can effect your game experience and fun.*After a time it can be boring watching how you've just won the league. Seeing a window with: You've won the league! Hooray. And then there's the new season, just like a year ago. (Maybe this is just me being a bit grumpy)*The only sound to hear from this game is the sound of cheering for a goal. This can't be difficult to change, can it?			"

												-Sigh- This game... Where do I start? Okay. Before you say anything about my playtime, listen. My friend told me that Soccer Manager 2016 came out not too long ago. 2015 was okay even though it had problems, but I was like ""hm, let's see what they did with the game"". So me and him checked out the game for like an hour. Now, I downloaded the game just so I could write this review. And this is basically what I got from that hour of playtime.First thing that bothered me is the whole ""share with friends"" thing. Okay. I get it. You want that friends compare the state of their clubs and stuff, BUT STOP TELLING ME TO SHARE EVERYTHING WITH MY FRIENDS THE WHOLE TIME! Jesus, you start the game, why don't you SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS?! Sign a player, SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Could you PLEASE stop shoving those words in my face, I already said NO! I don't have to share it with my friends, mostly because most of my friends would never play this.Secondly, why did you remove the feature where we could make our own formation? Makes no sense. I want to have some freedom when deciding the team tactics... I'm supposed to be the MANAGER, the creative mind of the club, yet I'm being limited to default formations? Also, the player info doesn't appear as a pop-up... Why? It was fine as it was. It's a small thing, yeah, but it was good as it was.Third point, your team (i.e. West Ham) may win 3-0 against City, but then they will lose against Shrewsbury in the FA Cup 4-0, even when you use the same team that beat City. ""Realistic"" simulation, huh?I could ignore all of that... But I can't ignore this: THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SHOP.Now, I understand. It's a Free-To-Play game but you still want to make money for the hours of time spent on developing the game. But come on... You LITERALLY can't do ANYTHING without buying stuff from the shop! In FM, you can ask the board for more money. Here, there is no football board, and in order to get money, you have to pay REAL MONEY?!If you want to make money, why not just charge for the game, and not have this BS of a shop system.Although these points have only been negatives, I like the game, I want to support it because I think it has potential. But the thing is, the potential is fading away. You can't say it's realistic when I can add 80 million in cash to my team's bank with real money. When the club needs money, it's the BOARD that gives it. Not the MANAGER. You can't market the game as realistic when these kind of stuff are in the game. I get so annoyed when a game has so much potential, but then they blow it.I think it's a 5/10 game. You can try the game out yourself if you want to. It's not bad, but the points I mentioned above make it fall to the below-average category.As for me, I'll stick with FM.			"

												I'm sorry to say this. 2015 was an awesome game, but this has one really annoying glitch while playing the game. An alarming amount of own goals that were supposed to be backpasses or just dribbled into the back of the net and indirect goals (ones intended to be balls in). If this was just every now and again, it wouldn't be too annoying but I haven't conceded any goals that aren't like this other than afew corners. Fix this, and I'll love this series of games again.Edit : Yep. Still happening. And another thing also happens now. Defenders pass it around at the back, then give it away. Lost 0-8 at home to Tottenham as Swansea. 2 own goals, 1 indirect goal, one normal one and 4 ones due to passing it around at the back. This game is broken and desperately needs an update. Annoyingly, the app isn't affected by these problems, which means the developers are perfectly capable of making a great game and clearly don't feel the need to give the pc version any attention.Edit 2: When I realised there was an update, i got really hopeful that this broken game might have finally got fixed. Then in all my pre-season friendlies I conceded at least 1 own goal. PLEASE FIX THIS GAME.			"

												As a free game, its a great download. Its really fun if you just wanna pass some time or you're really bored. It would be great if they keep it a free-to-play but i wont mind paying a small sum for a more complete game which is more realistic..thats what they gotta do if they wanna compete with Football Manager. So, here are cons which could prove to be helpful in developing the SM17 game hopefully:- Unrealistic ratings. Most average players are 85+ rated and this is too unrealistic..developers should give more effort to giving ratings similar to Fifa, cuz thats the only football game out there with realistic ratings. Players like Sven Bender should not be 91 rated.- The results are very predictable. There should be more pressure given to managers to think hard and bump up their tactical game.- Narrow variety of features and customization.- No option to choose the currency of the in-game money.- Not enough changes made from SM15. Once again, I dont mind paying for a game which is a few bucks well spent, FM16 is a great game but overpriced, so if SM17 is going to be around 2,3$ for a better and more complete game, its probably more thoughtful than keeping it as a free-to-play.

												As someone who is really bored of waiting for Football Manager 16, I decided to get this game, I enjoyed it but it felt more arcade-y then realistic, randomly, your team's form can just change in one match, the economy in this game is quite random with absurd prices, the ratings system is quite weird as well. Despite that, I enjoyed winning a goal and it had the fun of playing a football management game, It could've been better though with more detail but for some reason, contracts go forever, which is good, but for someone who is managing Peterborough United, it's quite expensive.7/10If you're bored of waiting for FM16, play this for a while.

												It's a very very good game considering its a free to play game. Yes there are microtransactions that can help you progress in this game much quicker (such as buying players without all the transfer drama/negotiation, boosting your team's stats, and instantly upgrading your team's facilities), but you can still progress at a reasonable pace even without spending real money. There are plenty of different options to customise how your players are being trained, but they are simple enough to understand that even someone not familiar with football (soccer) will be able to get a sense of what is going on. This game does feel rng dependent on times, and I would have losing streaks for unknown reasons. I could be winning against teams such as Bayern or Real Madrid with a pretty large score line and then somehow lose 7-3 to the bottom placed team in the German 2nd League using the exact same tea. Rankings also feel weird, like there are a ton of people that are 90+ rated in the game, which does not help when you are trying to single out a particular player to buy for your team.It is a very fun game and no doubt I would sink even more time playing this game in the future.

												i would like to start with a big well done to the creators of this game  for a free game i have clocked u many hours  on it and i am completely ingrosed by the game.there are a few things i would like to change but they are just my own opinions that i would like to have in the game, first i would like to have more control over the formations i do not feel that there is enough formation choices or the ability to create you`re own formation, i feel it would give ypu abit more envolvement in the game.Secondly i would for more options when it comes to transfers and loaning of players, i feel that ypu should be able to trade players in a sale and buy players then loan them back to the club it would make the transfer market that bit more realistic.aswell as that i would have also liked the ability to change the stadium design as well as getting investments and sponsors, and my final thing would be to have more envolvement in dealing and managering players and how they develope such as how they train having meetings with them and a bigger choice in how they train.i love this game and the things i have mentioned are the things that i personally would like to see in the game , on a hole this game is good for people that like manager games and i think that you will get plenty of enjoyment			"

												Soccer Manager 2016 is a fantasy soccer manager.  You have to like and know soccer to play and like this game.  It worked, looked good, plays off your Steam ID and can be used on other devices.  I guess it Plays like any other fantasy sports game.  Played a top down simple view fast match and it lets you coach too.  Try it if you like like Soccer and play fantasy sports games. I don't like or playing fantasy sports games, so don't know enough besides the game runs up to starting and playing a match.For more info:

												This game is pretty good. It's a simple way pf managing a wide range of teams. Though if you want an in-depth game this isn't the type for you. You basically buy and sell players and set up your sqaud; you do upgrade facilities and players get injured but it doesn't change much.There are in game purchases which gives you more money for buying players. That is probably the biggest let down of the entire game so you basically can't buy messi or ronaldo unless you pay money. Which is sneaky.The scorelines and games are quite realistic unlike your my mate who has 100 shots and wins 31-0 in a friendly they're realistic.I like the randomness of outcomes you could be in a winning league situation and then keep losing in the last five games and qualify for the Europa League next year.This game is easy to learn by yourself and can get quite addictive. So overall I would rate the game 8.25/10!People also say this is unprotective by suspicious looking things though it's really not. Trust me your 100% per cent safe :)			"

												For a free game, this is exceptionally good. I am enjoying playing what I feel is a simpler version of Football Manager and it is the simplicity of it that I like. Of course it could be improved by adding more realism to match ratings, matches themselves and player star ratings (outside of matches). Scouting would also be nice to not need credits for but it does not make anything compulsory to pay for which helps boost the games credibility. Overall, I do like this game and I was surprised at the level of quality considering it is a free game. Worth a download for anyone wanting to kill sometime who doesn't want to get into the sort of level FM has to offer.			"

												I'm still thinking why this game is for free, i mean for me this game is better than Football manager, why? because i havent played football manager....Overall my first 3 hours of the game went quite well, i just miss the skip button when watching the match , but it encourages you to change tactics etc. Loads of players on this game are well overated , i mean a player that isnt even in the first team with 89 rating , i mean cmon!But yeah i recommend this game.EDIT: I only got this game yesterday and already 17 hours :D What a great game!

												I really don't get what everyone says about this game. It's really a lot of fun, and a great time killer. While I wouldn't say it's very immersive and there really isn't much to it, I can never really get myself to stop playing. Losing streaks are only so predominant when you dont take a good look at the players you have or want to have and make good decisions. You really have to put yourself in the manager's shoes for this. I promise you you'll have a decently fun time playing this if you do it right.			"

												Wonderful game that is free!Pros: It's free, licensed player names and teams, Has domestic, continetial competitions as well as domestic league which in England goes to the fifth tier. A pretty good game, which has transfers, finances, training and scouting etc.Cons: Matches get laggy most of the time but I am fine with that, need statistics for domestic and continetional cups. Needs player and staff contracts, more in-depth staff roles and tactics need more depth to have more of an impact on the match like Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho. Transfer budget is questionable, I mean, how are AS Roma buying Paul Pogba for 60 million but Real Madrid only have 40 million and that is one of the highest budgets in the game. If I were to play as AS ROMA, I don't think I would have 60 million, keeping in mind that I am also selling players for that money. ALL OF THESE CONS ARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE GAME BECAUSE IT IS A FREE GAME AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE, OVERALL THE GAME IS REALLY GOOD!Overall Rating:8/10			"

												I apologize in advance for any spelling errors.TL;DR:- Crap AI.- Laughable budget for big clubs- Unrealistic results- Bearly any tactics- $50 FM is worth avoiding this cancer.+ Free+ Lots of clubs to manage+ Easy to uninstall.+ Don't need a refund.I tried really hard to get into this. I wanted so hard to like this. But I can't. Here's why. This game has so many major flaws it's unbelievable. I know it's free but this is just autism. Straight up autism. I really wanted to type this because most of the reviews are ""wy u no use steam itz so eazy nuuuuuub gooooosh♥♥♥♥♥♥dev♥♥♥♥♥♥dev♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Crap AI: The AI is unbelievable. The goalkeepers are emberasing. I've watched them run the ball into there own net. That's great. Defenders will do it too. Strikers can't get a damn shot on target! How hard is it! I can freaking do it with my fat♥♥♥♥♥how are they fluffing every shot unless there right in front of the net?The most dangerous shots you have a game is five. Five. Everything else that's ""dangerous"" is them saying LOOK HOW FAR I CAN SHOOT IT! *fluffs ball* Oh and gotta love the goalkeepr not grabbing the ball that's right ♥♥♥♥ing there. MMMMM LOVE IT!- Laughable budget- The money you get is just plain wrong. Manage the richest team in the world? Here's ten mil. Players that would fit your club are 50 mil. DOn't like it? Pay for cash injection. Either with real money or grind hardcore for the managing points that take longer and longer to get. Now listen I understand you guys gotta make money I get it I get it. But really? That low? You expect me to with the Champions League with no good substitutes and just pray my players don't get ebola for five months ruining my career. By the waaaay the board wants you to win the leaaaaague. HOW ABOUT A CASH INJECTION????? Heeeeeey the transfer window is open. Kind of hard to get all those world class players with one dollar. HOW ABOUT A CASH INJECTION????? The transfer window is gonna close soon. Maybe you can get all your shortlisted players if YOU GOT A CASH INJECTION!!!!! Transfer window is closed. GET THE CASH INJECTION ANYWAYS!!!!!!!Unrealistic Results - I'll be top of the table destroying title contenders. Looses 3-0 to a team facing relegation. I know it happens sometimes in real life but not every team I manage will loose to a freaking team gasping for points. How does ♥♥♥♥ing paris loose to Tollouse 4-0?????????? I bet Bayern looses 6-0 to Hamburg right? Logic.Bearly any tactics - Theres bearly any tactics and some clearly don't work. Got a 1-0 lead over a team who would normally tear you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Well let's just go on very defensive that should work. Wait you can't tell them to just hold possesion. Oh your defenders just gave up the ball. Oh hey there scored 4 goals. Mmmmmmkaaaaaaay. Can I tell them to stop trying to go for super long shots? Can I tell them to quit passing it out of bounds? Can I tell my ♥♥♥♥ing world class 50k a week defender to stop passing it right ♥♥♥♥ing to them in front of my net? CAN I? NO! NO I CAN'T!Now I know I've bin saying a lot of negatives but lets talk some positives- It's free.- Theres so many clubs to manage. I never cared for managing a team in Qatar. But knowing it's there fills me with happieness. - Because it bearly takes up any space I can happily uninstall with no hasle.- I don't need to refund it. I want to love this game and because I am an abused wife I will keep playing with this abusive husband hoping that it will one day love me and award me for all my loyalty. But we know it won't. Please avoid the abuse. For all of you saying it's better then paying $50 for FM. If $50 saves me from cancer. Take my wallet.			"

												As a fan of the old style football manager games such as Championship Manager 01/02 I am really enjoying this game. This is a simple and addictive free game which you can blast through a season at a reasonable pace unlike the latest Football Manager games. There are a few things that could be better, but there are also some big improvements since the last version including a 2D pitch view.			"

												It is a good, free football game when your computer can't handle Football Manager. Only problem is it is almost impossible to get your team promoted. The game is very against you and you will win ten games in a row just to catch up to the top three teams and maybe get third place. Then in the final five draw or lose them all to finish in fourth. It is really frustrating when I've finished fourth three seasons in a row.			"

												i actualy really enjoy this game, but i can understand why people have issues with it.I understand why people are annoyed by the login and also if you pay  money you basically win every game.So there is a easy solution. DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THE GAME. Plus when you don't spend money on the game it makes the game more challenging and i feel good about a win because i didn't pay to win. Just saying.			"

												(UPDATE) Devs listened to the Community input, and removed the forced login system, so cheers to the community and the devs!This is simply my first impressions on playing the game. You could say I didn't experience the game enough to give it a proper review, but this is about the time I just said I just couldn't play the game anymore. PROS: -It doesn't cost 50$ dollars like Football Manager 2016.-It's free.-Almost complete control and managing of your entire team!-Wide selection of teams to choose from! Meh. -It seems to have a Online DRM system where your unable to access to game without logining in first while being online. So if you have awful internet, and/or go offline alot, your gonna have problems with this game. (If you have good internet, and/or are online alot, your perfectly fine, this DRM system does not affect you.) Cons: -Game has in-game purchases using real life money...-No proper tutorial on what everything is, and how to properly manage your team.-Complex and confusing UI.-Large learning curve.-NO MUSIC. Or well, none that I EVER encountered. The only sound I got was from the crowds during a game.Conclusion:The game feels like a Mobile Game. A good king of mobile game... If you are into complex managing sim/sport games, get it.			"

												They want you to put so much money in to it, buy football manager instead. Your players get tierd so fast even if you rotate players. I played as Arsenal and IRL they have about 200m to spend on players and in the game you start with20m and you cant buy nearly anyone so to buy someone you af course have to put money in to the game.If they fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥it will be a much better game and no f*cking pay to win game.Its all about making money isnt it?

												Shortly after i logged in the game started to downloading some game files. I guess it was the data base. However, there was no progress bar, or info on how big this download was. After 90 minutes i had to turn off my computer and the download was not finnish yet. I have no idea what the download size is. I have no idea what the download speed is. I have no idea how long this download would take. I have no idea if i have to start the download from the beginning again or if it start where i left off. I don't even have a clue if the download was downloading or if it has bugged out..But i do know that i can't sit around all day waiting for a download when i don't even know if the game is downloading anything or how long it will take. So i guess i will never find out if this game is good or not. What a crappy way to handle the download of the data base. Why not include that in the original steam download??			"

												You can play this game for 1 or 2 seasons, but then it gets really boring. I appreciate a slow game, where you don't have to be in front of the screen all the time, but this game is too slow in a sense that you cannot do anything really. There are only a few functions in this game, definitely not a full game so far. Many things do not make sense, such as shots on goal from my team 15, shots on goal from opponent 2 - my team loses the game 0:2 or 1:2. No matter what I did, it always goes like this. Imagine how the score looks like when the opponent team has 6 or 7 shots on goal...you guessed it. I have read this issue from other players as well. It feels imbalanced and unfair. If you do not fire half of your team (you will still have plenty of players) you will be bankrupt. Do not spend money on this game.			"

												I'm trying to reinstall this as it is good when it works.  The first season was fine and the second season was ok.  The third season I started, every game I have an own goal and won zero games.  It was very frustrating.  No way does a team go 12 straight games with at least one own goal.  It's free and can be fun but let's see if I can fix this own goal bug by redownloading it.I reinstalled the game as I said above and the own goals stopped. However, there are more things that need work such as player contracts. Player contracts seem to go on for ever and never have an end date.  Players never complain about pay as they become more important for the team (increase ratings).  This simulator needs more reality with contract negotiations, maximum contract lengths, etc.... More interaction with single players would be desired. I'll still play it but there are better soccer manager sims out there (you have to pay for them but I do as I like more reality based managing gaming).  Not one player complains, the training system is a little akward with choosing different traits to increase. It might be better to just have the players train without the player selecting the traits they work on and getting more to the contract/player problems instead.			"

												Okay... SM2016 has made some little tweeks from SM2015 but its still not perfect, however, still loving this game. The fact that the 2D map now works, awesome! Also loving the rare feedback response from players from media questions - there really should be more of this. When a supposedly soft team kicks your♥♥♥♥♥the board lets you know they're not happy. My main peev is that when you upgrade the youth department it pumps out so many players and no one takes them on loan. SM is not like FM where you can offer players to clubs (loan/sale) to get them off your wage bill. My reserve team must be 40 players deep, all under 21yrs old. The board won't let you sell them (hate it - but love the realism), I can't  offer them, and even clubs from tiny leagues where my level 77 scub would own in their team won't come in for them.If I could send more of these field rats on loans to gain experience elsewhere I would be a happier and wealthier managaer. These tiny salaries in the masses add up brah!			"

												I'm trying to reinstall this as it is good when it works.  The first season was fine and the second season was ok.  The third season I started, every game I have an own goal and won zero games.  It was very frustrating.  No way does a team go 12 straight games with at least one own goal.  It's free and can be fun but let's see if I can fix this own goal bug by redownloading it.I reinstalled the game as I said above and the own goals stopped. However, there are more things that need work such as player contracts. Player contracts seem to go on for ever and never have an end date.  Players never complain about pay as they become more important for the team (increase ratings).  This simulator needs more reality with contract negotiations, maximum contract lengths, etc.... More interaction with single players would be desired. I'll still play it but there are better soccer manager sims out there (you have to pay for them but I do as I like more reality based managing gaming).  Not one player complains, the training system is a little akward with choosing different traits to increase. It might be better to just have the players train without the player selecting the traits they work on and getting more to the contract/player problems instead.			"

												Before taking anything into consideration, one must take into account that there's literally no reason to play this if you can afford to buy Football Manager, as it's better in anything you can think about... except price, of course. This does give Soccer Manager a solid niche as the poor man's football management game, and it does not do bad in that regard.Now, let's get to the game itself.Pros:+ If you ever played FM (Especially up to FM09), you'll be able to navigate quite easily.+ Extremely lightweight. You could teach Sports Interactive a thing or two in that regard :P+ Wide league selection. Nothing near FM, of course, but bigger than several not-free football games. *glares at FIFA and PES*+ The microtransactions are not intrusive at all.Neutral:~ I'd take the splash screen out of this version, to be frank. I would simply replace it with some ""Login with Facebook"" option available in every screen, but not a dedicated screen for it.~ There is no option to create customized formations, but I can give it a pass. It's not easy (In terms of it being reflected in the engine. If Football Manager can struggle, then why not this?) and... I guess it has to be portable and multiplatform.~ It's not exactly the most realistic thing in the world. Mostly comparable to FM Mobile. Expect some crazy moves... but it can add in the flavor.Negative:- Somehow the game does not look as well at 1366x768 than in 2015. For instance, I have to scroll down in the tactics screen to see the entire pitch.- There are several interface issues that were not fixed from 2015. Several ""intuitive"" actions that cannot be done. For instance, you cannot pick players from the squad screen, and you cannot sort players by star rating in the tactics screen. There are others, but I want to keep this short: The number of clicks that are necessary to perform an action should be reduced. And add some kind of indicator for hyperlinks in news posts.- Some leagues have the wrong format. For instance, Argentina uses 20 teams and no average point system instead of 30 and average points.- The Copa Sudamericana does not exist, and the Libertadores uses the same format as the Sudamericana.- The translations are a loooooong way to go.tl;dr What I said at first - good if you cannot have FM. Stay away otherwise. The story *could* be different on mobile platforms, but I can't test that.			"

												This game actually suprised me with how good and fun it is. For a FREE football manager game it is excellent. This will obviously be compared to Football manager and in my opinion, I prefer this game. I find it to be far less complicated than football manager and and for me is more addictive. I have played with one club my entire time and it really is a blast.The only problems with the game is microtransactions, which I understand why they are in the game, as it is free. I however have not bought any of the coins and have had no need to. If you however want to have two saves for example you will need about 1000 of these coins. Another problem is with all the pathetic backpasses that lead you to concead absolutely stupid goals and is really frustrating to watch.Overall I would definately reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the beautiful game.
