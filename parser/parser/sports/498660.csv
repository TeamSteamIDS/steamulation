												Mind SpheresFirst wow. I really did not expect this simple game to be so good. Amazing work. It's easy, but still not too easy to play trough. Levels are designed well, they look good and you really have to think how to get trough some of them. Design of the whole game is really nice, it's relaxing and beautiful. I purchased the  soundtrack too when buying this, I can recommend that also if buying this game.Ofc all games have something bad in them, so does this too. When you are moving the triangle objects its so hard, they move very rapidly and it's hard to place them right sometimes. I have not seen any bugs etc. so far. Last but not least if you like solving puzzles and playing simple games that can help you relax, this is really a game for you. My grade for this game 7,5/10			"

												I was hoping this game would be like the old Incredible Machine series. It is not.Everything is already placed and all you have to do is rotate each item so the ball can make it to the finish. Sound easy? It is very easy... I wish you started with the items in an inventory and had to place them to make the path for the ball. That would give it a little more challenge. If you want a game that takes under 45 minutes to beat 50 levels, and super easy achievements, then this is the game for you.			"

												Mind Spheres is a puzzle game where you need to move a marble from one end of a track to another, by manipulating elements in the track to get the ball where it need to go.  I got it from a Indiegala giveaway, and have found it pretty fun so far, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents.First, this game is pretty casual.  Its music is very relaxing, and its puzzles are relatively easy compared to most Steam puzzle games (*coughEnglishCountryTunecough*).  Also, it doesn't have a lot of mechanics, though it does build on the few it has (This game takes the ""less is more"" approach to its mechanics, which is good).If you're looking for a tough challenge, you won't find one here.  If you're a puzzle game veteran who wants a long game to sink your teeth into, you also might not like this one; I tore through about half of the game's puzzles in around 20 minutes, and completed it in ~1 hour.  But if you want a relaxing puzzle game, or if it's your first time venturing into the puzzle game genre, Mind Spheres easy to recommend.This is a physics game, and the physics are relatively sound (I really don't understand why the game has a space background, as the puzzles are pretty grounded in gravity).  Three flaws, however: (1) I've had to restart a level multiple times because I put my platform JUST A PIXEL TOO HIGH and the marble got stuck on it (which is super frustrating.  This even happened because A PART OF THE LEVEL was sticking out and made my marble stop.  Really?!), (2) the lack of zoom in this game or any way to rotate the camera does not help, and (3) the triangle-bouncy-thing makes the marble bounce *way* too high, so it's nigh inpossible to see where it'll come down.  It's also a tad irritating that you have to restart the whole level when you make just one mistake, but then again the levels are so short, it's not too big a deal (not as big as it might be in other games, anyway).This game also chooses the ""learn by doing"" approach of teaching new mechanics: it just puts in new platforms in as you go, and lets you see what they do.  I think it works, mainly because the levels introducing them are short enough that you can just try again if something unexpected happens.  And I definitely prefer it over a boring tutorial.Mind Spheres also has Steam trading cards, so.  There's that, if you're a trading card fan like me.  It also has quite a few achievements, all which are unlocked naturally as you progress.All in all, this is a pretty neat game, a casual physics puzzler with some good fun to be had.  I'd totally recommend it if you want a light, relaxing experience.(Also, personally, I would LOVE a level editor to create and share my own puzzles--the simple mechanics and maps just begs for a level editor.  PLEASE, Microblast Games?)			"

												This is a quick and easy puzzle game that you can do a little bit of and feel great. The puzzles are fairly simple and straight forward, but it's a fun exercise while waiting for something to install or just a moment of down time. The rotation of background and 3D objects might not be OK for everyone. Right now ""Great Schematics"" level 6, the 36th puzzle has a design flaw that traps the ball in a loop of up-the-ramp behavior because the bounce at the bottom of the ramp isn't strong enough. Neither peice is movable, but up to this point it was nice to spend 10 minutes here or there playing.  Because I cannot skip a puzzle, the rest of the game is locked. It came in a bundle, so no real loss, but it would have been great to have gone forwrad.Overall the game was nice and the kids enjoy the challenge themselves.			"

												Fifty minutes is what it took me to finish it.I got it for free but I would buy it because it has potential. Okay so, the problem of this game is, or rather the two problems are:1. It's too easy- From start to finish this game shows no challenge. Even the slightest progression would improve the overall feeling drastically2. There is no support for custom levels- Even with the ""too easy levels"" that came with the game, user base would be able to create awesome content with this game. In general, I liked the art, the background music (""Relaxing The Sims kind of music""), I even loved the simplicity of it. Minimalistic and yet so elegant. Menus look great too.Gameplay is rather simple, with a couple of different objects that ball can interact with, but as I said, even with this limited toolkit, this game needed some feeling of progression. More challenges. Maybe allow us to move the interactable pieces? Make levels harder as we move on, opposed to just adding new pieces with different behaviours while keeping the same old ""tweak a bit to solve"" mentality. Some 40+ levels were easier than the first few levels ... I think that this game can be something awesome with mod support and some tweaks.			"

												Mind Spheres is a cool concept and very decent for the price. It reminds me of one of my favorite physics puzzlers Enigmo. However I ran into some issues with the game during play that make it diffifult/cumbersome.For starters I am playing this on mac and starting around level 9 periodically the screen would go completely white and I couldn't see the puzzle anymore. You could click spacebar to initiate the sequence but then hitting R to reload would make the screen go white again. The only solution I found was to restart the game entirely.Secondly, the game the board each time you attempt the puzzle so you can't make small tweaks to execute the puzzle correct. You have to start from scratch each time.Last point - given there are multiple ways to solve the puzzle it would be fun to have a timer to show how fast you were able to solve the puzzle. Alternatively, achievements could be awarded for taking the most round-a-bout way.I really like this genre of games but I think it may require a couple of tweaks before recommending to a friend. Please keep making games like this though!---EDIT---After reviewing all of the updates that the developer has made, I would recommend this game to a frieend. I really like having the 'saved states' so that you do not need to recreate your work all the time and I have not experienced the white screen crashing as noted before. I still wouldn't mind seeing a timer and challenges eventually added but great work on the updates! Thanks.			"

												(Key received for free from Indiegala.  Thanks, bros!)Dev claims that Mind Spheres is like Golf and Pinball.  I feel it's more like a Rube Goldberg machine that wants you to tinker with bits and pieces of it until you find a solution to each puzzle.  Simply modify each platform until you are finished redirecting the ball into the pedestal.Aside from that, there's not much to know about Mind Spheres.  It's priced at $2, but is $0.50 when it goes on sale.   Grab it when it's about $0.10-$0.50 if you want a quick, easy game that you can finish in an hour.  It also has card drops, so you'll get a slight refund from your purchase.   Although I think this game's really fun, the replayability is a bit low and the price tag also betrays how much you'll get in return.6/10  A nice, casual experience about guiding a ball into a hole.

												Took me 67 minutes to beat this game, but ya know what? At $0.49 it was cheaper than most arcade games.This was a pretty fun puzzle/physics game; it did keep my attention enough to beat it over two play sessions. My only complaint is that the game is too easy and doesn't reach its full potential. I was only challenge on the last few levels and even then, it was more of a game of getting the physics to work and less of a puzzle game. The game could use more levels with alternative ways to win. Also, free DLC with some bloody hard maps would be nice!!At $0.49 on sale or $2 regular price, you're still going to get your moneys worth.			"

												Mind Spheres is a good time, for its asking price. It's a very forgiving physics puzzle game. Also extremely easy. Take it from someone who's usually not very good at these. If you've ever played anything out of the Crazy Machines series, you'll feel right at home here. There's a ball that needs to get to its location, and you have to make a path for it.Thing is, all the pieces are already set in place, and all you do is just move them around. The engine also got buggy at times, and the wonky physics can sometimes work in your favor, allowing you a degree of flexibility (or luck) as you complete some levels clearly not in the way it was intended. There are no other game modes besides the campaign and the 50 puzzles, so replayability is out of the window.It only took me an hour to beat everything, but for the short time it gave me, it was enjoyable. At least it's cheap. "

												Completed the entire game in 61 minutes. Puzzles not so challenging, with some luck and 'trial and error' involved. In some puzzles, some pieces don't even serve a purpose and can be completely ignored. Even if you don't fine tune the pieces the ball can still reach its destination with a bit of luck. Game lags after some time in, and consumes too much RAM. I had 5 out of 8 GB of RAM filled and the game stopped working, and I got a warning from Windows that I have to close the program. I had to restart it one more time before the warning came up again because it was lagging. This issue needs to be fixed. Music is good and relaxing. I got it for free, so I give it a 6/10. If you're looking for a short, relaxing and relatively easy puzzle game, get it on a sale.			"

												this is $2 normally or 0.50 on sale currently... I figure should take around 1-2 hrs to beat it. 90% of the levels are very easy to the point it is more of a watch the ball bounce around. Sometimes you have fun with the engine when things go just a bit off and the ball starts bouncing around wildly, sometimes in your favor sometimes not....To me it was 1.6hrs of relaxation of watching a ball bounce down almost effortlessly on my part and .1 hrs of somewhat frustration on a pixel being off and having the ball get stuck on one level.Well worth 0.50....
