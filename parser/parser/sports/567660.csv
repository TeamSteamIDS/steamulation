												Fun Puzzle and Physics game with baseball theme.GameplayBaseball Riot has a fun and simple gameplay.Here you need to control your bat to swing the ball in the right direction to pick the stars and kill all enemies.Also each area has 2 achievements,that get's more challenging every time.ObjectiveYou have to kill all the clowns and other enemies that works for explodz,like the prequel ""Tennis in the face"" after a injury on a game that makes you impossibilited to play for your team.GraphicsThe graphics works fine and are beautiful drawed.Also is all very easy to understand and play.Most of the pcs can run it with no issues.Sounds/MusicsGood background musics and sound effects are present here.They make their paper on the game,without being boring and irritating.Final Note:9/10The game is fun,easy to pickup,and everyone can play it.For who wants some fun,the variety of levels and challenges are great,and for who is more collector,the achievements will give some work.Review for Neka Club Curator "

												The masters of simplicity (10 tons) has made it again, I didn't see it was them at first just instantly thought of King Oddball and I was very right.The difference between it and this is that you get to aim this time around rather than just time the release, I've played a lot of King Oddball (it's just perfect for a fast game while uploading to Youtube for instance) and I can see myself play a lot of this as well.If you like very simple game mechanics in games that are fairly hard (in that you're calculating the angles) games, try it out (or King Oddball...or both :)) I think you'll enjoy it...I love it, great work you Finnish lot, great work.

												The baseball version of their title ""Tennis In the Face"" Is here, and it's a load of fun, you play as Gabe Carpaccio, a retired baseball veteran who's seeking revenge on his corrupt Explodz Inc members, easy to leran and hard to master, a ton of fun trying to knock everybody with a single hit!The graphics look pleasing, they're colorful and vibrant, the game runs smoothly on any pc that has been manifactured After 1512BC.
