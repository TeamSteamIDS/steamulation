Early Access Review
								I so wanted to love this game as I was a big fan of Pilot Wings on the N64!I suggest the developers should find and play it for inspiration, it was very similar.I would love to the features from that game, including the powered hang glider.I was totally disappointed though with this game because of the control method.The human head and neck is not designed to control and steer games. I dont know if I am spoiled because I have a VIVE and not a Rift, but it seems to be the RIFT's fault there are so many like this. Its rubbish. We dont ever do it in real life (control where we are going with our heads) and if you want to look at all that lovely scenery they have have made, you probably crash! I was trying to imagine if we drove our cars like that, OMG!Controllers, any, Vive or Xbox or anything please developers! I want to lie on the floor, arms outstretched holding on to the bar (that seems miles away to me in my headset) in front of me, pushing and pulling and tilting. Far Cry's hang glider feels more real to me than this because of the controls.The game has potential, but I am getting a refund right now in case they dont change the head steering method. Will buy again if control methods change though, as then I see it working well.			"

								I don't write many reviews and you may be looking at what I'm saying here and thinking ""hey you only played 15 minutes... what do you know?""I pretty much saw all this game had to offer. You start at the top of an island mountain, run off the edge of some kind of plank, and then fly trying to collect rings. That's it. That's the whole game. Some rings are worth more than others... why? Cuz. The motion controls, moving your head to turn, dive and climb... AWFUL! Who thought that up? A game that may require quick manuvering and as much control as possible... LETS STRAP A 2 POUND DEVICE TO THE FRONT OF THEIR FACES AND THEN HAVE THEM MOVE THEIR HEAD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AS WILDLY AS POSSIBLE TO FLY A HORRIBLY UNWEILDY AIRCRAFT! BRILLIANT!I hope that person got a raise. MY NECK IS KILLING ME! Getting an ice pack, some bio-freeze and a refund. VR shouldn't hurt.			"

								i love flight Sim's and  Pilot Wings for the N64 so if you have moderate resistance to Sim sickens like me you should love this game. now I'm not saying it is perfect but for a early access game it is a much better base product than most and if it receives a steady stream of updates it will be amazing "

								Hi Joey,Great Title! Thank you.After playing it for a while, here are some of my suggestions/feedback.The glider needs to be closer and the rainbow needs to be killed off totally. I get really bad stutter when the rainbow is in the picture. I use the Gigabyte EXTREME Liquid cooled 1080 GTX. Quad core 4.2 GHZ proc and 16 megs of ram. The other island runs perfectly. I would also recommend changing the animated clouds, as they have lots of weird shapes around them. Also, a man after my own heart, Games never have enough ambience. You are on the correct path sir! The storm was great when it hit me! We need more stuff like that... birds..whales..ships..bugs..people overlooking cliffs..campfires..schools of fish..etc..the list goes on and on. This game will be incredible when out of early access. I am more than willing to help out, as I have been creating art all my life :} I know you have just added and artist to your team. So..I am sure, some major grafx updates will come soon enough! Also, the wind thermals need better art sir. I would personally love the choice of using controls also, not just move my head for turning. I would love it if i could just hold the vive wands in front of me, like i would be holding the pole, and steer..just like in real life :} Being that you named this Glider island, did u plan on any other types of machines ? Rocketbelt, mini motorized gliders, Skydiving..etc. I can easily seeing this game hitting top sales when completed. What you have done so far is epic to me! Cannot wait for your finished version. Thank you again Joey. I will play again after work..test some more..and contact you asap. I had sent you my email this morning also :]Thanks for knowledge and helping me with my project also!You are to kind sir!I hope the sales go up and up for you! "

								Better than I thought ir would be. I remeber when it first came out it recieved some negative reviews because of it's head tracking only control. I bought it after haptic feedback Vive controllers option was added. The way it let's you align the craft to exactly where you need it to be and the overall sensation of gliding around both work great. Nice addition to add some variety to your collection.			"

								I just tried this out for half price. I would say 5$ is much more reasonable. Its a relaxing experience none the less. Enjoyable to fly around and collect hoops. Although I wish there was more to the gameplay. The Vive hand controller method was a little tricky at first. But fun. I actually enjoyed the head controls more... Its easier and more relaxing. I am interested in seeing the newer version, Overall I feel this developer has potential.			"
