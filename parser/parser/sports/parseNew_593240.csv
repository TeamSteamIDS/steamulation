												Fun! Similar to Wii Sports, solid no glitches, gave me a little work out, need more rounds and AI opponents in boxing, also in baseball maybe add some basehits, doubles and triples in the mix and not just have homers and outs.  Overall fun game.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game. The soccer mini-game is frustrating and very often you will feel like you blocked a ball when it just goes straight through your gloves instead. The basketball game should really have more than a timed 3 pt shootout. It would be more fun to shoot from anywhere. Bowling is good actually. Homerun derby is really not taking advantage of vr, it's something that was done on the wii over 10 years ago. Not really something you should advertise as ""brand new""... The shooting mini-game is a huge waste of time. It doesn't feel very polished at all, and gets boring quickly. The japanese archery is alright, but there are better archery games on steam, some of them for free. Boxing feels very unnatural, and is totally outshined by ""Thrill of the Fight"", which does boxing very well in vr. I am disappointed in this game to say the very least. Sorry.			"

												Got this game from a giveawayThe game is itself is very entertaining and challenging. The mini games are well designed and easy to play. But the game still lacks multiplayer options compared to Wii sports which is the most important point of having sports games... Some of the mini games has several issues. For example, Clay Shooting is way too hard and holding the gun with both hands is buggy ; Bowling is unfriendly for players with a small play area ( the rack is so far back). Hope it can be fixed Let's see if the updates will add more modes or settings to improve its replayability or not			"

												Most of the sports in this game range from ok to broken, but the one game that instantly grants this a thumbs up is the boxing game.The developers should be proud of the boxing game because it is one of the few games that gets the hit detection down perfectly and the opponent's AI is very well designed and able to deliver a challenging but fair fight.If Nintendo ever decides to make a ""Punch-Out VR"" this engine is the right one for it. Until that happens, I'm sure that anyone looking for a good VR boxing game will be satisfied with this. "

												6/10 I want to like this a lot because I really enjoyed Wii Sports. Unfortunately it falls short. First off, it feels lonely. In game there aren't any AI bots walking around or making noise giving you the feeling of being somewhere like in Wii Sports. Having friends watch you from outside of the Vive is nice but you don't feel immersed because you are alone in the game world but talking to real people next to you. Add bots that sit and watch it are having random conversations or cheering or playing their own games beside your area. Second, the only good games are bowling and basketball. The archery is mediocre, soccer goalie is unintuitive, the homerun derby is worse than Wii Sports, and shooting and boxing are absolutely awful. But the games does right is polish on these games. I haven't experienced any bugs. There's a lot to improve on and hopefully the dev will add more mini games within each game. For example, for basketball instead of just 3 point contest add HORSE or maybe 1v1 with a bot. For archery maybe add moving targets or time attack mode. Bowling maybe add bot for 1v1 or add obstacle mode like Wii Sports. Expansions are endless. Wii Sports did a good job as an entry into the system when that was released. With more additions to VRSports, it could probably have the same impact as well. For $9 at the time of this review, I recommend this ONLY as more of a tech demo for showing new to VR people. This ""game"" has potential and I hope the dev fleshes it out further. The lack of any settings menu is odd as well and I hope in the future we can maybe have an avatar to customize or at least adjust graphical options.			"

												Very entertaining and fun VR sports game with 7 different sports disciplines to play. Here is my first impressions, gameplay and review in Mixed Reality view and VR:


YouTube™ Video: VR Sports Gameplay in Mixed Reality and Steam Key Giveaway of this nice VR sports experience! 

			Views: 1,000		

			Let´s play VR Sports in Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality on HTC Vive, and after the gameplay let's do a new Steam Key Giveaway contest where 3 of you lucky guys will win a free copy of VR Sports!		

The video says it all, but I personally enjoyed a lot playing VR Sports, as all the mixed disciplines are well done, they have nice graphics, sounds and immersion, and at the same time can be quite challenging as well! Like Wii Sports was a great title for Nintendo Wii, this VR Sports title is a very nice VR sports experience for the HTC Vive. I will extend this review after a few more gameplay hours!			"

												I'm having fun for the most part. But a request for the developers, please rotate the hand position so that your vive controllers show your hands sideways instead of palms down for bowling. It doesn't work right as it is. My controllers have to be physically turned weird in my hand to bowl naturally. Its uncomfortable. Please fix this. Also, the environments are very blah. It needs more stuff going on. Pictures, trees, birds, shadows, people in the background, something. It feels very barren, and lonely right now. Maybe I could recommend this after it gets more finished, but for now, it's very bare bones, and isn't as fun as Wii sports.			"
