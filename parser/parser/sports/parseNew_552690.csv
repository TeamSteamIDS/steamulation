								Super relaxing game. Definitely a go to game for unwinding and playing something that goes at your own pace with its own bit of challenges.			"

								Although not a perfect game, there's a lot of quality content here, and the Devs are still working on it and adding new content all the time!If you like rube goldberg machines, golfing games, physics games, casual games, or even challenging games, then Fantasy Fairways is for you.The gameplay varies from being able to beat a level first try, to having to find some way to abuse the physics systems  and force a ball through a wall to make the level less frustrating. Which is a good thing.The art is great, there's so much extra little touches of animation and effects on everything that really are fun to look at.The gameplay can be a little hard around ther edges at times. The game is designed to reward players for building up a shot over multiple moves, by adding and moving things around but keeping the same ball trajectory. The only problem is some obsticles work on a world timer, and not a shot timer, so the physics wont always be consistant between shots. (I'm told that the devs are working on this issue)			"

								I'll start by saying this, mini-golf games are not my cup of tea.  I'm not a big fan of them and while I've played a few they are a genera I tend to ignore.  That being said, there are many positive qualities about Fantasy Fairways.  The sound design for the game is lovely and relaxing.  The art is pretty and the animations are interesting and just as beautiful at times.  I enjoy the little touches in the game, like how the flowers get sucked into the hole after the ball goes in.  The game offers a nice challenge as well.  It isn't just try to get the ball in the hole and avoid the opsticles.  It challenges the player to think and to really figure things out.  Getting a hole in one is going to take a fair bit of skill and spatial reasoning.  It is this unique spin to the game that really makes it stand out from the rest in its genera.  (Honestly, I think they should add puzzling to the genera list.)All of this being said, the game is not perfect.   It is still in its infancy and it shows through the various glitches and limited features.  The tutorial especially could use some work as the player has to figure out a lot of the features for themselves.  However, the foundation for a good, if not a great, game is there.  This is a excellent game for those who enjoy challenging puzzles and people who like mini-golf games.  I look forward to seeing how it evolves.			"
