												Ok. I can't explain how HAPPY I am to have a Hockey game on steam. Maybe now I can get rid of my Xbox One and NHL 17... I'm not so sure. I love the Sega Genesis style, but it just feels to be lacking. It is really hard to switch players. I wish it was more acurate and when you switched players it selected the player closest to the puck. The puck to ice physics are meh. The puck doesn't slide enough. The controls are not horrible, it would bve nice to polish them a bit more. I understand the Sega feel, but it just feels a tad clunky still.I really hope the devs stay on this release and we see some good patches. I would LOVE for them to eventually add ONLINE multiplayer, even at the barest of bones. Just let me play a match. I don't need rankings/leaderboards ect, it would just be nice to form a communtiy around this.If the devs read this, as I think I am the first person reviewing this, PLEASE continue to support this game. It has a ton of potential, even more so with a DEAD sports section on PC (Look at Rocket League). I'm loving it so far, and I for sure watched the leaked footage on youtube and still purchased Day 1. Please update this game!Edit 1: I'm happy to see the day after release they have already updated the game and acknowledged the issues and fixed them already! Keep it going devs! But uh, why do I have to go through the tutorials multiple times? lol.Edit 2: Today they updated the game, yet again. The list is extensive. Would still love the online multiplayer. I feel alone. :( Maybe even a shoot out mode. Keep the updates coming guys! This could be THE hockey PC platform game. There's no other competition ;p			"

												Even if this game isn't without flaws, I would still recommend it to any hockey game fan out here. It has a lot to do to be the ultimate fun and violent hockey game to get, so there's my pros, cons and wishlist about this game. Pros Unique visuals and overall 70s ambiance The ability to develop as a team in Story mode by gradually unlock controls (alot of people hate this one, but I think      it's a fresh way to learn control and add challenge to the game) The soundtrack  Ultimate fun hockey couch gaming with friends experience Overall humor here and there in the game Cons Clunky player selection (not fluid and intuitive like old and new nhl games) Forced tutorials during story games (suggestion in the wishlist) Some bug here and there (who's probably gonna fixed) Wishlist Online mode Unlock the controls and do the tutorial during team practices instead of games (could be shown in the calendar) Instant replay (even nhl 97 have this function on the SNES) Practice modeOverall, this a good and fun game for the price. It is perfect to play with friends in coop. If you want this game to be better and to offer more content, back it by buying it. You're not gonna help the game by leaving bad reviews because the game dont have features you didnt pay for. Play it, leave decent comeback, and be a part of the community.			"

												I love that theres a hockey game on steam but I dont like how you have to unlock controls . I dont like how the GK makes a save and you cant control him when he has the puck. He just dumps it to the side of the net.			"

												For 12 bucks this is a great deal, with only one real negative. The negative is that you have to do this odd story thing where you have to unlock moves.  I get what they're trying to do, it's cool you play more you unlock more modes, and skills.  But this is very clunky way to do it, and it's not fun having to get on fire three times, and score with same guy, just to complete a primary objective.  Win the game 9-1? Doesn't matter if you weren't on fire 3 times and fought the goalie...  I've won same game over and over, but have only managed to score 2 on fire goals so I'm stuck replaying this rather early game just to advance to learn and start fighting.Having said all that, this game and story are really fun, I played three hours straight and it works better than ubisoft games on release day! Looking forward to seeing where this game goes.  If you liked the movie slapshot you'll enjoy the random stories that are told as well.  8.5/10 with potential for a 10will update review in future as well.			"

												First of all, the lag on the controls is just awfull. I mean awfull. Having played hockey games for decades, this has far the worst lag on passing, shooting etc. It's a fun game no doubt, but really a mess from the start when starting the tutorial. You have to pass all the tasks given to you in order to get the advanced controls but at the same time you are supposed to use use the rookie controls but for my part they didnt work but insted you get the advanced controls with only passing, wrist shot and body check. Which all have a major lag in them.Be prepared to lose games in the beginning from left to right. The AI on rookie level is skating past you anywehere on the ice since you don't have the boost ability.....due to rookie controls, not advanced.I had high hopes on this game to be straight forward and fun. I did not expect any simulator hockey, but after 10 games I just quite. It's not fun due to the lag on the controls. And the fact that you cant use the same tricks as the AI in the beginning.			"

												The game is great, old school gameplay and that feel is there. NHL Â´94, Blades of Steel, Ice Hockey, you know it. The story mode is a great idea excecuted badly: it's just not fun that you can't do all the moves from the beginning. It's not fun to watch AI hooking your guy and you can't do it back because you haven't unlocked hooking. Just frustrating. I think skating speed was okay but goalies should hold the puck, not just shove it behind the goal all the time. Maybe we should even be alloved to do the opening pass, not just AI doing stupid passes randomly.Overall a very, very welcome release to long gone genre of arcade hockey. Get it, support it and they might make something really special of it.			"

												For fans of the oldschool hockey titles, this game is an absolute gem.Lots of fighting, very few penalties, and a wry sense of humor coming from a clearly small, yet dedicated developer. There have already been several patches since release, constantly improving performance and quality-of-life.It won't replace big bad EA any time soon, but hey, we finally have a hockey title made this decade for the PC, and it's a ton of fun!

												It's a decent enough approximation of a hockey video game for the asking price.  Suggest they patch this soon to address the sluggish controls and tweak the story mode, because the occasional line brawl or ridiclulous goal isn't enough to look past the major flaws.  And if you DO score a ridiculous goal, get a good look at it because there's no replay, which, come on now.EDIT:  I still recommend this game (on balance, it's pretty fun) but if you score 20+ goals in a game, it will crash right as time expires in the 3rd.  That sort of sucks.			"

												This game honestly has a lot of potential. I'm so happy to have a hockey game on PC and be able to play another hockey game aside from NHL. But there are some cons with it as of now. There is lag with the controls and you actually have to unlock the advanced controls. So basically you are playing on rookie controls while the AI is on advanced. The Story Mode is a very cool concept. I was wondering why my team was so bad in the beginning but then I realized it's supposed to be that way and your team will get better down the road. I do recommend this game, however, be aware that there are some bugs and chances are you won't be an all-star right when you jump in to your first game. At least I wasn't and still am not. Aside from that, I think this game could be really exciting. They definitely need to add a multiplayer feature though in the future.			"

												After a few hours of play to write this, I will change it from time to time hopefully.I've been waiting this game for a long time, since the trailers in fact. + Nice atmosphere and cool ideas+ Soundtrack is great (ft. Leningrad Cowboys and more !)+ Story plot has a lot of potential+ Devs are reachable- Tutorial and Story Mode shall be separated, in order to play a full season (or more!) with full controls and really get the Brews to the cup (or  more cups!)- Controls are a bit slow/dull, and I'm not very harsh with them in the first place- Goalies are complete robotsRequests :=> Multiplayer=> Custom leagues => ADD TEAMS (and their players) THROUGH WORKSHOP (I've been told by devs it was a possibility for the future)=> Team customization ? (Kits, gloves, helmets, etc... )=> Be a Pro career in the style of NHL, I know this is a tough request but it would be such a great thing !=> Radar ? Or at least a way to see where teammates are, so I don't end up doing weird passes to the opp. defense. I'm a little bit disapointed about the story mode, as it should not be a tutorial for so many games.Controls are weird but I might get used to them, I've played a lot NHL14 and I've always set the speed and stuff to be as realistic as possible, making some controls very hard. I feel a bit the same here on OTH so it's ok atm. Team AI and goalies AI could be improved, I find it hard to set up plays in front of the net. Also, goalies are robots that never freeze the puck and release it on the side of the crease. It's predictable and can bring weird plays.I love the ideas that drive this game and the overall atmosphere, which is why I bought it. Also, it's quite cheap atm. All the above make me think I would recommend the game, but it might be worth a wait to see what's tweaked and eventually added in the coming days/weeks/months.			"
