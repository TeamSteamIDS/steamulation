												The tables are designed pretty amateurishly but the real issue is the physics are total trash. Fodder bundle game that doesn't even have the decency to drop some cards. For some reason they couldn't even make the pinball a proper sphere either.I got it in a dollar bundle with 30 other games. This is par the course.			"

												First of all. This is a PROPER release for the PC.Resolution Options?         CheckController Options?     CheckThe game has a user friendly UI and plenty of user defined graphic options that the average Steam PC user has come to expect and will appreciate their inclusion here.The camera options are more than sufficient and the game runs without any lag or choppiness.You get 3 tables which are ALL original designs and eachl utilizes the SOCCER motif. These tables are NOT rules-deep and play more as a fine time waster than anything else.The physics. Imagine Peggle meets VP8 and/or Original FP and you will know this isn't a SERIOUS pinball sim but rather an ARCADE rendention. The ball is very LIVELY, and the one element that suprised me, is that the simulation is CONSISTENT, so you can get dialed in and actually have a FUN and CHALLENGING game of pinball.This is worth the normal price of $3.99, and if you find it onsale, GRAB IT, you could do a lot worse.

												This is an OK pinball game.  I recommend it only for those who are not pinball snobs though and only on sale.Non-proportional stretching of the item models on my widescreen appear to make things look slightly squished vertically, ball physics are definitely off, and the music is very repetitive after a bit.  The 3 tables included seem to include minimal modes and mini-games so, no, it's not comparable to Real Arcade or Pinball FX 2, so just be aware of that up front.  That said, the controls work well for keyboard and 360 gamepad, and it even has one feature that the big boys don't: you can enter your highscore name with the keyboard.  Maybe they could learn something from this after all.  :)			"

												Well, I must be a 'Pinball Snob', whatever that is, because this game is rubbish.The tables are too small and lacking in features. Again like Fantastic Pinball Thrills the nudge is more like shake the table. There are too many better pinball games available (even for 30+ year old platforms) that are much more fun than this. If it was a free game then my opinion would be different, but the content does not justify any cost as far as I am concerned.0/5			"

												Got during the Autumn sale for under $1 and it was a lot better than expected, recommended!6 camera choices, 3 tables, will play again.Full screen only and no seen plunger if you care about that.I played this with Windows 10 at native 1920 by 1080, no problems.You can turn off the music, which I did, some graphics options, and the ball noise is optional.It's a fair pinball game, not up to the quality of more expensive ones, but worth their price, sure.Not realistic pinball style, if that is what you are looking for, see Pinball Arcade and Zacarria Pinball.
