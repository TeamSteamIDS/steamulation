								True story, I have not fired an actual shotgun in 28 years.  I trained using Clazer for about 4 hours, had a lot of fun doing so.  A few days later I entered a 10 round skeet competition among NRA members and avid hunters and to my surprise, I won the competition.  How about that for an endorsement of training in Virtual Reality?  This program is the real deal.  It works great with the Vive and the Oculus Rift.  You not only get the feeling that your are really at a range, but you also get the muscle memory of leading your targets and practicing the proper timing of your movements.  Without Virtual Reality it's a fun game.  Incorporating VR and tracking input devices makes this is a formidable training tool that really cant be described.  You just have to try it for yourself.

								This is fantastic. Its not so much of a game but as a proper clay shooting simulator. And its so very real! Im an avid clay shooter already shooting quite a few games per week currently. However no matter how much you do manage to get to the grounds there is never enough time. This solves that issue. You can jump in for a quick round any time you have 10 mins spare. It quickly helps!Clazer also allows you to repeat a tricky stand over and over and learn where you are going wrong. it shows where you should be shooting if you want and you can see where you are going wrong. Currently there is sporting, DTL (Trap) and Skeet. They are the American version of the games as skeet has the stand in the middle of the towers.The only negatives I can see right now is the mount of the gun is hard to get right and not really relative to a real mount. I believe there is a mount coming along with the tracking puck. This will make this the best thing ever!A probably minor aside, but worth a mention, you can actually control super sampling in game. Gives you the option for some very very nice graphics if you have a higher end PCIf you are into clay shooing, or looking to get into it. This is a must!			"

								I am a true sporting clay/skeet enthusiast and have just recently acquired Clazer.  When I  got my Vive online the very first thing I looked for was a clay simulator but could only find arcade type target games.  Then came Clazer!  I found it very realistic and found teaching mode (shows an X where you missed the clay) very helpful.  It may be a bit easier than actual clay shooting, but it is close enough for good practice around site picture, lead, stance, holding point, breaking point etc.  I cannot wait until I get the gun mounted controller and can use my real shotgun.  I think with a weight of the real shotgun the difficulty level should definitely rise to realistic levels.  Both opposing thumbs up on this simulator!!! Whether you are already an enthusiast and love clay shooting or just want to learn Clazer is for you! "

								If you are into shooting clays you will love this game.  If not, probably not so much.  It has two major bugs that have not been fixed for months:-After a while the wind noise increases in volume to hurricane like levels.-In skeet mode it does not handle misses very well.  Sometimes you shoot the option and can continue to the next shot, sometimes you shoot the option and it just sits there forever and you have to start over.  This is super frustrating.			"

								This is hands down the best replacement for trap/skeet/5-stand shooting I have every played. I shoot a lotBut in the winter it is not as easy. Each part of this game is fun and hopefully makes me a better shooter!  One handed operation is easy and quick to master. The ability to see where you missed is so nice. The features are great and I can only see better and better things from this game and company.			"

								OverviewThis game for me has been a lot of fun and a big help to my clay shooting ability from my limited testing. If you aren’t aware this game is designed for fun but is also as accurate training tool of what it is like to shoot Skeet, Trap and 5 stand in real life. I have shoot all three sports but mostly shoot the game of Skeet. Getting good at any of them is a mixture of memorizing the leads and just getting in the reps. So, for example to get very good at skeet shooting where you can get a perfect game can take playing between 100 to 200 games. This is a very expensive process and to get very good where you can consistently get perfect games can cost up to 30 thousand in ammo and field time. I suspected the clay shooting sports would translate well into VR and have been looking for a game sim for the VIVE since day one. I have been disappointed up to this point as all the other games that have clay shooting don’t incorporate leading the target making them of no help for actual training. For my test, I have not been skeet shooting for over a year. When I left, I was consistently shooting 22 to 24 with a 25 every now and then. Last time I took a year off when I went back I was shooting 18 to 19 for the first few games until the rust was off. Both times off we after a child was born. When I first played Clazer I got an 18 then a 19 and worked my way up to 22s and 23s. My first game of real skeet shooting after a year I shot a 22 then a 21. So it looks like the game helped me shack of the rust of not shooting for a year. GraphicsThey are as good as they can be for a VR game where you are shooting as something small. The native support for super sampling in the options is a huge help to make everything sharper. The scale of everything is also perfect from what I can tell.SoundThe sound is also spot on. The shotgun sound is exactly what a real shotgun sounds like with the echo. It could sound strange to someone who hasn’t heard a real shotgun as most games and movies get it wrong. GameplayI love how you can show leads and pick a station you struggle with and just shoot until you get it wright. You can also play a full game and get your score at the end. The game is still in the early stages but is see signs of leaderboards and other features. The other big question is how far off is it holding a controller vs a real gun. For me when I miss it is mostly because I have the lead wrong. The controller is nothing like a real shotgun but the sight picture is correct in VR. Clazer is also building an attachment to allow your actual shotgun to be safely tracked in vr. If they can pull that of it will be amazing but is not as necessary as I thought, it would be. ConclusionIf you shoot any of the clay sports or want to shoot any of them this is a must buy no questions asked. If you have no intention of shooting the clay sports I encourage you to look at a review of a non-shooters as it is hard for me to say as I love the sport of clay shooting. I hope to push myself up to consistent 25’s over the winter and see if my real shooting follows along. I hope to get out once a month for a few non virtual rounds.			"

								Great simulation! Ever been interested in learning to shoot? This simulation will help you learn to lead targets and improve your aim! You can play without VR but I would recommend playing in VR for it is a lot of fun! Immersive visuals and audio also make the simulation a great experience.			"

								CLAZER is the best VR shooting simulator - because it teaches and trains how to do something in VR that is directly applicable to the real world. CLAZER is going to be the best way for new shooters world wide learn how to shoot moving objects  - sporting clays, trap shooting and skeet shooting. It is the most time efficient and cost effective way to learn wing-shooting, since it shows the shooter where to aim - then shows them where they have missed. It has the three main clay shooting games - Trap, Skeet and Sporting Clays - both singles and doubles - with a Competition Mode, Training Mode and Practice mode. Unlike other FPS games, CLAZER takes lead -""forward allowance"" into consideration; simply put, to hit a moving object - including a drone - you have to shoot in front of it.  CLAZER shows you how to do that. With the gun peripheral - which you can attach to your own shotgun, you can practice with your own gun in VR. If you are a shooter - you will be impressed. If you are not a shooter, you will be after you have gotten good at CLAZER!Check our their website at clazer.club			"
