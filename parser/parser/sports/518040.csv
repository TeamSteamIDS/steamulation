								Only 5 hours in and I'm already considering this as one of the best purchases that I've ever done. Kudos to the creator!			"

								Bought as soon as released. Considering this is in Early Access it's a very polished game. Attention to detail is amazing, jump-floats, floats, digs, sets, it has them all. Heck even the referee gives the correct hand signals and my AI partner gave me a pat on the back for a good Spike.If you like Beach Volleyball, buy this game.If you don't like Beach Volleyball - It's high time you started. Buy the game! p.s.Unlike real BVB players these players don't get injured. Get well soon Laura Ludwig.  "

								if you like volleyball and want a volleyball simulation game look no further i tend to be skeptical and weary for early access games but this game was a ace right out of the gate and i can only see it getting better			"

								This is an incredibly solid game. It's almost like you took what made DIg and Spike Volleyball great for the SNES and made it for the modren era. If youre looking for a great volleyball game this is it! Be sure to play the hell out the tutorials as they are critical in your playing the game well. Kudos to you Mr. Developer for making a great the has so much depth and getting it so right. Thank you thank you thank you!			"

								I wanted to play this game for a few hours before leaving a review.Positives:-Not very graphic intensive, so you dont need a beast computer to play it. -Feels good when you get good kills or make nice plays-Very fun and addicting-As a former professional volleyball player, this definitely scratches the itch of wanting to play for real...lolSome negatives/improvements to consider: -The AI of your teammate is not bad, but there are movements that need to be ironed out. There are times when the ball is coming towards you and you try to pass it, but nothing happens. You expect your teammate to block at the net while you play defense, but sometimes he awkwardly stand in the middle and doesnt play defense and the ball literally goes thru his body. I'm sure that will be fixed in final release-There is a command where you can tell your teammate to either play defense or block at the net. (A button+directional).   However, during a rally, you're running around using your directional and your A button. So half the time youre telling your teammate 3 different commands and it just gets messy...especially during transition. -Some people say the menu is clunky. While it could definitely improve, I dont think its that bad...I'd rather the developer forcus more time on the gameplay and iron out the bug/glitches.-I hope down the road, add some more game modes such on multiplayer of some sorts.Overall:I recommend this game even during early access. The developer sure did put out a solid game for us to play early on. I'm really excited to see how this game develops			"

								Needs a lot of polishing, Especially on the passing, setting, and hitting machanics. But other than polishing things up and fixing clunky systems, the game is better than I could of hoped for. It is very entertaining and fun to play! This game would be fun for people who don't even play volleyball in real life!! I am really looking forward to watching this game progress and be able to play the finished masterpiece one day!			"

								I took my time buying this game really, reading all the opinions and they were all right! this is by far the best volleyball on the market for sure. Gameplay is almost perfect with the comp AI mostly on a very high lvl. So far the thing that i find most ""inaccurate"" is the sound when u hit/block the ball (it doesnt sound realistic to me). But thats such a minor thing its not even worth mentioning ;)			"

								My first review ever. Long Story short...Simple Controls, satisfying and funny gameplay, low requirements, less than 2 GB storage, adequate price, graphics ok. You can create own Players and earn experience points to increase player skills during career mode (I'm a big fan of these options).Fans of ""Fifa 17"" or similar titles may be disappointed about the simple gameplay, details or possibilities, but it's definitely worth playing. I usually don't play sport games, but i like this game.If you like Volleyball, you will like this game too. Otherwise it may not kill you to give it a try. There are much more disappointing titles in the endless space of the Steam Store...			"

								Worth every cent to purchase. Runs smooth graphics are just fine. The AI is incredibly smart and the stat system actually matters. You can definately feel changes as your raising your stats. Very large progression throughout the seasons with National and World rankings and tournaments reflecting your current rankings.			"

Early Access Review
								I am not a fan of writing reviews - but I have been waiting for this game really long because I play beachvolleyball. First of all: I love this game and it's worth every single monetary unit spent. However there are some things I want to mention although for an early access version the game is already kicking ♥♥♥. I am playing on REALISTIC control with a gamepad and on realistic speed with an EXPERT AI partner - so my few issues only refer to that setting.- It is pretty clear to me, that the actual field margin for in/out decisions is not computed. Because some balls that are clearly visible ""in"" are counted as ""out"" - that helped me beating some tougher opponents; still it should be fixed.- Balls that come diagonally out of court past the antennas are counted valid. In reality everything that is not in between the antennas is out of bounds and so it should be.- The team I play mostly with is a statted pure blocker/attacker and a defender with matching skillsets. However if I control the attacker (and tell the AI to defend the back) even the EXPERT AI defender misses balls that are really easy to get (in reality) because he stands perfectly in the right spot. This seems to happen for opponent's ""bad"" spikes mostly. However just because it is technically a spike doesn't mean that you cannot defend it, if it comes directly at you or you stand in a good angle to its path.- On the other hand when I control the defender (with high statting, world rank ~30) i really love how you have to be real quick and anticipate what your opponent will be doing. BUT! even if I anticipate diagonal shots or tricky digs my control ""receive/set"" doesn't react although I am in the right spot - which is quite frustrating from time to time.- In my opinion - compared to reality - MANY lucky digs do occur. The opponent almost lost the ball and out of nowhere comes a super sharp dig which is almost not returnable. Either these balls should be returnable more easily or they should not occur so often.- I absolutely didn't figure out how to dive. My Expert AI teammate can dive perfectly and even set reasonable balls that way. When I ""dive"" I just lie flat and the ball flies behind me instead of forward?! Maybe an extra tutorial would be an idea?- Spikes should be defendable way easier by using tomahawk technique - like in reality, when you have the correct angle and position.MISC:Sometimes the spectators whistle really loudly and sharply - this cannot be turned off in the sound options!MISC WISHLIST:alice bandsponsor tagsathletic tapetop body beachwear of course, hahaNontheless, thanks for a great game out of the box with great potencial. Keep it up please! :)			"

Early Access Review
								Love volleyball and thank you for making the time.  Definitely needs polish but its early access.  I will just list the bad in here in hope updates will come but thank you for making the game and a pretty good one at that.So here are the things that need to improve:* Menu system is a bit clunky * Blocking controls are a really tough (running up and basically into the net is weird) - maybe just give one button control for this * Still not sure how to dive for the ball (the players feel really slow when going after the ball)* Animations on passing and setting breakdowns are weird (most of the bad sets would get called immediately in the real game so maybe the animation needs to change from a hand set to something that is more of a closed two hand push)* I think the hitting/digging/setting circle should be bigger so its easier to establish that somethign is happening.  For example its really hard to understand when the action is initated leading to a lot of over holding or under holding (see jump servers)*Basic float serve training feels like a guessing game - I tried to serve the second successful serve at least 50 times and could not get it in.  Finally gave up.  Gotta tighten up the feel of the actions a bit.* Part of me wishes the graphics were more cartoony but smoother in animation vs. more realistic but less animated.Will write more later.			"

								As some have previously mentioned, sometimes the AI is a bit slow to react and freezes when the serve comes. Also, I have played this game for two full hours and only once did the ball vanish from the court and neither side was awarded the point (which led to me having to quit the game and restart it). For that reason, maybe an implementation of a ""Restart the point"" button in the menu could be available once per game or something to solve this uncommon issue. That being said, this game was exactly what I was looking for; a professional volleyball game simulator that goes beyond expectations time and time again. Thank you so much for making this game happen.			"
