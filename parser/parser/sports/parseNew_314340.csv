												Chess 2 was clearly developed with the intent of making Chess new and fresh again, and it succeeds completely at this prospect.  One of the most intimidating aspects of Chess 1: The Original is just the wealth of pre-established metagame that's been developed over the many long years it's been around.  With six (count em, SIX!) unique factions instead of just one, all the old material is completely thrown out the window and you have to learn Chess all over again, and that, I feel, is wonderful.  No longer is it about memorizing countless openings or having a wealth of unfathomable experience.  Instead, you play it like you would play a modern strategy game - thoughtfully pondering your own decisions and creatively coming up with your own solutions.  The midline rule also keeps the action tense throughout and prevents the more boring, drawn-out endgames of Chess 1; it feels like the way Chess was always meant to be played.If you have ever been intimidated about picking up Chess before, now's the time to join Chess 2.  The sooner the better - joining in while the game is young will be an exciting opportunity to see it evolve, and to help shape the metagame and history of the game yourself!			"

												The game Chess 2 is very enjoyable; the application Chess 2 is a mess. It feels like very little work was done to port this from Ouya. There are zero options: you cannot adjust resolution, quality, you can't even adjust the volume or turn off the music! The menu's don't seem to like being controlled by mice, you can only click on the deepest ""slice"" of a menu, even if the other menu options are on the screen.Online play also has zero options. You search for a game and pick an army, but have no control over who you play or extra rules like the time each player gets. There is no rating system for players, no chat system, no friends system, no ability to start a game with a specific person (!), nothing. This application is missing SO MUCH that paying $20 for it makes me feel ripped off. This is not $20 of quality. This is like $4 of quality. Maybe. I'd pay $5 if I could turn off the terrible music.In other words: don't expect much.			"

												I came into this as someone who was initially interested in playing traditional chess, but didn't find it to be very fun due to the emphasis on memorization. I think it's more fun to think more ""on your toes"" instead of having to invest time up-front to memorize chess openings in order to enjoy the intricacies of higher-level play (just like how some people don't like having to memorize long combos in fighting games in order to really enjoy the game at even a novice level). Chess 2 really nails this issue, as well as fixing other issues that make it much more fun to play.It's not really feasible to have an ""opening theory"" due to the many different possible matchups, so you actually have to think about the strength of different moves right from the start. The midline invasion rule really helps to keep the games from dragging on and making it easier to win without having to figure out how to checkmate or end up with a stalemate.The ""dueling"" mechanic adds a fun challenge of trying to predict what your opponent will do. Overall, the experience of playing and learning this game has been quite enjoyable, and this implementation gives you a nice way to find opponents to play against that are around your level (using an ELO system), so you don't have to worry about being thrown into match after match with people who are much more experienced than you.

												If you do like chess and agree to pay 25 bucks just for an upgraded chess game buy it. But only for the game... Chess 2 does not have a UI that reflects the price. Moreover it's lack of in-game chat between players, the missing rating and post-game stats and the slow-pace (The graphics seem sloppy, it makes me think twice if I'm clicking the right spot) don't help... They new rules are indeed genius but it needs much more to get to its actual price. The game just feels incomplete. I really hope they put work on it but in the state it actually is...  I do not recommend the game.			"

												EDIT: There are no more future updates (afaik) planned for the game, and IMO its a great game but wasn't fully fleshed out with all the basic features. The population has bottomed out, so if you're buying it for multiplayer then you may be out of luck in finding games. This isn't really the developers fault, as indie games have a hard time in capturing a big multiplayer player pool. It was an interesting take for a chess variant, and I hope more tactics games similar to it come out. I am always looking for that next pvp tactical game.To Chess Players:If you're more of a tactics player (short term captures and plans), you'll enjoy this game. Chess 2 (C2) is a much more fast-paced and unpredictable game than traditional Chess. C2 has 6 armies to choose from (there is the classic Chess army, but also new armies with unique units & movesets), and you can face any of them from your opponent, so games will have very diverse matchups each time. There are also 2 ways to win: Getting your king past midline and checkmate. This ensures games are faster and have less draws. But with the midline invasion rule, it is very ""race-to-win""; there are less quiet moves, less subtle improving moves to a better position, less strategic play. Rather, its more just a string of tactical plays IMO.Knowledge of Chess can help you in C2, but it will only help you so far. You can throw most chess rule-of-thumbs out the window, as there are new pieces with new rules. Controlling the center is good, but controlling the sides is also important as the king usually tries to flank to one side to invade midline instead of going into the center where he'll be mated. Castling early and often is actually a bad move. Fianchetto is waste of tempo, as bishops are on a better diagonal from their starting position. Knights are usually better in C2 because its usually semi-closed or closed positions. And because of that, rooks are usually worse pieces because the position is closed, but also because you castle less often providing less exits for your king rook. However, pawn majority in center is still important (if not even more important), and also the knight on the rim is still grim :-)If you liked Chess because of same teams and starting off on even foot, you might dislike the 6 different teams. They are balanced, but are balanced in a bubble (as in they are balanced with respect to Classic Chess army, but some have advantage/disadvantage versus each other). It's a case of Perfect Imbalance (Two Kings army>Reaper>Nemesis>Two Kings). So you might dislike the fact that your army performs better/worse versus the enemy team, but it is is only slight advantage. But this provides opportunity for each game and opening to be very unique. Another factor in the game is the duel system (betting system). Whenever a piece is captured, you can bet against your opponent for the fate of the unit doing the capturing (that unit will also be removed if you lose the bet). This duel system was implemented for mind games, but it is only wild guessing IMO. It is like rock paper scissors, the player that picks his weapon by thinking 7 moves ahead is just as good as the player thinking only 4 moves ahead or 1 move ahead. Although there are limits to the betting system (you only gain betting stones by destroying an enemy pawn), and it is more complicated than I give it credit for, it is still for the most part an arbitrary system.Overall, I would recommend C2 to chess players, because of its familiarity to Chess but also because it brings new life and something refreshing to it. The less you think of it as chess + new elements, but rather just a new board game with chess elements, the more you will enjoy the game for what it really is :) GL HF.			"

												I want to like this game so much. The ideas behind Chess 2 seem so good. So far Chess 2 seems like a great Chess variant.The problem is that this particular implementation just seems unfinished. You can play Chess 2 against a horribly weak AI. You can play live in 25 minutes a side games and you can play Correspondence games. Your rating goes up if you win and down if you lose (presumably based on your opponents rating).The game looks nice and bar a few crashes, plays smoothly. But there is so much missing that you would normally take for granted.No rankings ! You can see your opponents rating and yours in game. Out of game you see...nothing. No win/loss ratios. No breakdown of each armies win/loss. No leaderboards!!!!You cannot challenge a friend. You play against random opponents only.For a game that's supposed to be all about multiplayer this is just unforgivable.There are no options. You window resize (unless you edit the game launch properties yourself). The music is nice but you cannot turn it down. You cannot even turn it OFF !Your games are saved for replay. There's no chess notation. You cannot view your opponents or your own previous moves.Even the Steam Achievements are just so boring. Again, just ... barely ... there.Mind boggling. If this was early access I'd give it some slack as the core of the game is there and it is great. But in 2014 the total lack of any features is crazy. Especially when you consider the price.Hopefully the game can get some much needed support and thrive but we will have to wait and see.Right now... I would not recommend this to anyone.			"

												This is ""Chess"" on steroids.  It could use an options menu (I was unable to find one) so that I could adjust basics like screen resolution and audio volumes.  I would have also liked the ability to choose a side and a difficulty when playing against the AI.  Complaints aside, the new armies and the midline invasion rule really gives players a new way to play.  A little pricey for the content it offers, in my opinion, but still fun nonetheless.

			Chess 2 the Sequel: Impressions Chess 2 the Sequel takes the traditional game of chess, adds new armies, and new layers of rules and mechanics.		

Chess 2 takes the classic game of chess and adds in a bunch of new armies and it's own flavor of new rules. Chess players should feel right at home, as chess 2 still keeps true to it's heritage. Besides a selection of armies to play as, one of the most significant rule addition is the new median line. Any king that passes it wins, essentially adding a whole new win condition to the classic game of chess. Chess being an old as the hills game, the Sequel does a pretty good job at introducing new metas and strategies to really freshen up this ageless classic.Visually the game goes with a realistic look. At first glance it may not have the visual impact of a more stylized game, but I think fans of chess will appreciate it's more sophisticated aesthetic. The pieces are well detailed with intricate trimmings and most importantly off all, the new pieces look like they belong in chess, and describe's it's characteristics well. Though Chess 2's core is strong and enjoyable, it's not with out it's flaws. There are serious ""quality of life"" issues with the game. The lack of any sort of options, visual, audio, or even a menu is very odd. Even 8bit games have an options menu so I don't understand why Chess 2 doesn't. The game also focus on it's multiplayer. Though there is online play, there is no lobby system, no way to match with your friends currently. This is a huge over sight for a game like this. The devs did mention that they have an update planned for some sort of match making, which is great to hear, but it is missing on it's release so keep that in mind. Overall Chess 2 is a wonderful game that will have veterans giggling like school girls, delighted at the discovery of new metas. For chess fans, this is an easy recommendation, but if you are just the regular gamer, curious to chess 2, with out more features or an options menu, it's always good to do more research.Pros:- Discovery of new metas- Armies are interesting and unique- Appropriate and detailed visuals- New rules are enjoyable- Still feels like chess, but new!Cons:- No options- No Lobby- Low on features			"

												Quick first impressions review: I'm not a huge fan of chess, but the rule changes in this game really spice up the gameplay and give it a new appeal. Having six different chess armies with new pieces and new abilities adds a lot of variety to the game and requires new tactics to win, especially with different army match-ups. I recommend this if you have any interest in chess and fancy a different challenge from the standard game.			"

												This is a truly great game! It has some bugs and is missing some features but the core is great and that is what really matters when it comes to games. Some more options and features would have been nice but it has all the essential pieces and you will certainly be able to enjoy the game for a long time.It is simple enough that you can get into it fairly quickly but advanced enough so it will feel fresh for a long time and surprise you with new combos and strategies. A must try for fans of the turn based strategy genre or chess fans. If you want a strategy game without luck then this might be the game for you. The six armies manages to make new games feel fresh and you have to adapt different strategies depending on who you are facing. The mid-line invasion rule makes the games shorter and more intense and often result in heated battles around the chess boards mid-line. The game feels very balanced, there are no best or worst army. If you don't like chess or think you are bad at it I would still encourage you to try this game, I think it feels different enough that you might enjoy it even if you don't like normal chess. Also, if you are bad at chess you will feel right at home here, we are all starting from scratch and are trying to figure out how to play this game ;) However, I think you get better at normal chess by playing this game so this might be something for someone who want to get better at normal chess as well.If nothing else I would recommend this game so you can learn the rules and play it with a physical chess against your friends because it is a really fun chess variation when you get the hang of the new rules. I was quite skeptical in the beginning, especially about the bidding and the new armies but it actually works and fits really nice together. So do yourself a favor and try this strategy game, the worst thing that can happen is that you don't like it :)Rules:               9/10UI:                     6/10Fun factor:        9/10Options:            5/10Graphics:           10/10Music:                8/10Game modes:    6/10Army Balance:   9/10Score:                 8/10			"

												I was fortunate enough to be part of the beta test, so maybe some bias here!I could talk about the game's polish all day (hint: reaaaally good polish.  I'm a particular fan of the music, but wow do the 3d pieces look amazing), but the most important thing is that it's just really, really fun.  Playing around with the different armies, improvising new strategies, trying out openings-- it's really refreshing to have this level of freedom compared to chess.  It's surprising, too, because usually when a game is designed to be really well-balanced (which Chess 2 is), the designer takes out most of the exciting stuff and you're stuck with a game that's really well-balanced, but not all that fun.  But in Chess 2 you have an army with teleporting pieces, an army with two kings, and an army where adjacent minor pieces share eachother's powers-- nothing is broken, but there's a ton of variety and a ton of experimentation you can do. Midline invasion is a really underrated change, too.  It makes games way faster and more exciting, and it makes kings less weak as a piece!			"

												I don't know whether to recommend this game or not. I bought it at the $10 price point, which isn't much I guess. The overall idea is OK, but personally I don't like the betting stones for pieces thing, and I just wish I could turn it off and play `a piece captures a piece` (along with the music- I'm forced to play with no volume).The worst part is the AI. I read other reviews before purchasing and thought, OK the AI isn't great but it must be playable. Frankly, it isn't. Most games are won in very few moves and the AI is almost unresponsive to threats. Seriously, move a pawn out of the way and march your king/s across the midline, very minimal resistance will be offered, you will win.So with no viable AI, you will always need an online player.There's no 2 player option, so at the moment you can't play a friend or family member at home using the same computer. Why is this not an option? It seems like the basic option? Actually this is what tips me to not recommend it, because without this option, there's no viable way to play the game, which otherwise might be entertaining.			"

												I have been a fan of Chess 2 since I first heard about it and started playing with friends.  This version is good but does have some downfalls.  First, about 30% of my games end due to losing connection with the server. Troubleshooting tells me that the problem is outside of my network.  Second, the game freezes at times when I press the exit button, and I am required to shutdown the computer in order to move on.  Third, there is still a small number of users which means you cannot play a competitive game too often when you sign on.  Fourth, the lack of a player vs. computer mode makes the game virtually unusable if others are not available to play.  I would also like to see a way to easily pair up with your friends, a 2 player one screen mode, a way to chat as you play, and statistics such as win-loss record with each army.The visuals are solid, the gameplay is great, and I love the game Chess 2. This version is just limiting in the overall enjoyment.  Patch fixes and updates would make this a must play for anyone who likes chess or strategy games.			"

												Although ""more like Chess than Chess"" is pure hyperbole, Chess 2 is still an excellent game.  It retains the strategic, thoughtful core of basic Chess while breathing new life into it.  The midline invasion and bidding rules encourage more aggressive play and force players to adapat and think on their feet, and the additional armies are fun without being unbalanced.Is Chess 2 better than its predecessor?  That's hard to say.  But it certainly makes a compelling argument.			"

What the game needs: A live online finder that isn't so bleak and hopeless (you NEVER find a match).A computer that actually plays well (the computer made stupid moves 50% of the time). The ability to pick your opponent in single player. Conditional moves (If they do this, then I do that) AND email alerts in Coorespondance. I have other suggestions, but they'd be mostly cosmetic (add more boards, more music, though I love the music you picked). Try to partner with Chess.com and really get this online!!! Great game!			"

												Chess 2: the Sequal is definitely a top notch strategy game.  While many are skeptical that the game is in some way anti-chess, I think it has taken the best elements of chess and improved them, and it has taken the worst elements of chess and replaced them.  There is no memorization, no two games that look alike, no mobility problems, no useless moves, and (almost) no draws.  It is just you and your opponent. I learned the game before it was developed to be on the PC, which is why my ""hourage"" is low and why I have early access.  IMO, it is really worth the buy, when compared to the price of an ""ok"" chess set, with just the regular rules and pieces, the price of Chess 2 is a steal.  Quick P's'n'C's:Pros- extreme depth in strategy- elements of intrigue- faster (than chess) paced games- (as a result of the previous pro) no long games that feel like a waste of time or feel tedious- massive replayability (6 armies to chose from)- the game is simple and elegant (in its PC form) complimenting its depth and complexityCons- as of yet, i do not see a way of inviting a steam friend, or any friend to play via correspondence, making it a sort of hit or miss if you want to play with someon you know.  Maybe an update will add this feature someday.			"

												I can't say if this game is any good. Sure, it looks really sharp and sounds good, and if you thought chess wasn't complicated enough, then your tastes will be catered for. If, however, you just want to play chess, think again. Is it just me, or would it have been the easiest thing in the world to enable you to actually play chess in a game that has the word chess in the title ? Considering how they must have had to write the basic rules of chess into the game, it must surely have taken more effort on their part to remove the time-honoured classic from Chess 2: The Sequel, than to leave it in.This is a chess game for people who are paradoxically so bored of chess that they don't want to play it any more.

												Very interesting chess variant that works surprisingly well. The AI is extremely weak so I wouldn't advise getting it for anything more than casual single player. In fact the computer player only exists to help you learn all the new rules and the game is focussed mainly towards multiplayer.You can choose from several armies each with its own set of new and interesting rules that actually add a great surprise dimension to the classic army (which is also included). Even when using the classical chess set-up there are two main variations on the basic rule set. You win if your king crosses the central horizontal (half way) line without being in check and there is a bidding system (called a duel) when capturing pieces. The graphics are adequate and functional and there is classical background music that seems fitting. Due to the extra complexity involved in coming to understand the innovations I would not recommend this to people who are not already familiar with the usual game but chess enthusiasts should be delighted by how well the changes work.

												1st up I do not have a clue how you would get any Achievments as Single Player (looks like to me) you cannot get Achievments and may only be able with Multiplayer.This is nothihg like the Original Chess, I wish I had never Bought it, Single Player Sux. The Line in the Middle of the Board is a Stupid idea. I can not and will not recommend it due to its $14,99 price as it not the Chess that I am familiar with as well.I would love to get my money back but its probably impossible now, this will most likely get deleted and never play again unless there is some sort of original Chess Play optionaly.The Details look very good and thats about it for me.

												It's like real Chess, so don't expect anything fancy. There are 6 armies with different abilites you can choose, but as I said, it's not anything fancy.It's not worth 14.99 by a longshot but it's worth about 3-5 dollars in my opinion. I got it in a bundle ^_^			"

This review is going to be a work in progress, I just want to write down my thoughts about the game after playing almost an hour.The bots are very easy to play against, and the AI doesn't really know what it's doing, but it's a nice practice for people who aren't used to the rules of classic chess, or the other armies the game has. This game has tons of different armies, each with a different style of gameplay, we have the TWO KINGS mode, which involves two kings that can move around the map very quickly. Nemesis, where multiple pieces lead a focused attack on the king. The animal army, which has a TON of power, but can't move very far.There's an army called Reapers, which have teleportation and immortality.Empowered, which has maximum mobility when pieces are in a team formation. The very last army is the most well-known, classic. The armies adds extreme replay value, and since it's chess no game is exactly the same. Each opponent you go against will never have the same strategy, but the problem is there's not many opponents to be matched up with. I was in the queue for like 10 minutes and I couldn't find a match, which is a shame. Maybe i just tried finding a match at a time that isn't the peak time. The game takes the classic game of chess, and allows many variations on the great game we've all known for a while, to be played on your PC at home. This game is great, and if more people buy it in the future, I can see a very competitive fun game to sit down and play. (I am currently making a gameplay video/breakdown/review)			"

There is a bunch of weird♥♥♥♥♥rules that makes no sense and then comes with the largest learning curve I have ever seen with any game, let alone this small of a game. I'd encourage anyone that would spend money on this game and had any interest in chess to go to chess dot com. You don't even have to spend money to have a blast.			"

												Anyone can make up different rules to a game and say they've made it ""better"", and that's all this game is. The king is now OP, he can cross the board midline in about 5 moves and win instantly. They also made a faction with two gay kings that have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t little ""whirlwind"" attack. There's even a faction with a magical queen that can take almost any piece on the board every turn. This game was made by someone who hardly knows anything about chess beyond the basic piece moves and decided that a centruries old game needs changes. It's like playing your first round of dota and getting hooked by Pudge, just because it seems OP doesn't mean it is, the creator's just a chess scrub. I wouldn't so much mind that you aren't able to play with friends on a game that's solely multiplayer, but there's also no news blog whatsoever. So there's absolutely no telling when they're gonna even add anything. How am I expected to play a game that doesn't let me play with friends. I wish I had something good to say about this game but there's nothing worth mentioning outside of the decent graphics, UI, and tutorial. 3/10 - Don't get it unless it's on sale and the dev team gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.

												This is an extremely misleading game. Firstly, there are a bunch of theoretical, silly chess moves that often times make very little actual sense. Secondly, IT CALLS ITSELF CHESS AND IS NOT IN FACT CHESS. I JUST SPENT 15 DOLLARS FOR A GAME THAT IS NOT CHESS WHEN ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS PLAY CHESS. I assume there is a lesson about books and covers in here somewhere, but screw all that noise, i just want to play a regular gd game of chess.			"

												I think 6 is too many armies.  I'd have left out Empowered which is too much too consider while playing.  I'd also remove 2 Kings cuz I think its the lamest and it destroys Reapers.  Other than that the other 3 new armies are great.  The developer wanted to throw the book out the window, 4 different armies alongside the other changes would be enough.  The only other controversial aspect for me is the stone system, which is okay but I'd prefer a design without it if i was in charge.  The  Reaper Queen would just need to be altered a bit.			"

												I am not sorry i got this, but I only recommend it to those with an intelectual interest in chess variants.It is a decent attempt to break the hold chess theory has on the game for the last 100 years. Chess960 (or Fischer Random Chess) did this to a lesser extent, breaking only the hold of opening theory. This one goes a bit further, adding new sets of pieces, new rules of movement for each set or piece, new mechanics for capture and adding the new victory condition of the king crossing the middle line. From the prespective of a chess fan, this is mind expanding, and liberating. It remains to be seen if there will be opening books for the different chess sets and so on. So, IF you are interested, buy it and study the proposal. Think of the experience as an interactive book on chess variants.Be warned, however. The AI is very poor. You will probably be able to beat the game very soon on single player. And it doesn't contain or allow for a normal chess engine, so you can't play normal chess with this software (or any other of the many other chess variants out there, for that matter). This software is good IF you become interested in exploring this variant, and even then you will have to go multiplayer.			"

												Major review change to properly reflect the long-ago addition of multiplayer with Steam friends - now Recommended.This is a fundamentally ingenious and fun game, and totally worth the modern price tag - $10 for one copy or $15 for two - but only if you have Steam friends that will play it with you. I recommend it to anyone who's ever seen even a little fun in classic Chess, and I especially recommend it to people who are frustrated that classic Chess proficiency relies too heavily on the memorization of optimal, routine movement patterns.With six perfectly balanced ""armies,"" including the classic set of pieces, as well as a couple new rules - dueling and victory by midline invasion - the strategic possibilities are too multitudinous to pre-plan your matches, requiring players to put more effort into getting into their opponent's heads.The five new armies are easy to learn and discovering their quirks is great fun. For instance, the Reapers have a Reaper Queen instead of the regular one that can teleport almost anywhere on the board but cannot threaten the King, while their Rooks are replaced with Ghosts that can also teleport anywhere but they can neither capture nor be captured (making them into the perfect blockers). You can actually play Chess 2 with an ordinary Chess board without needing any additional pieces (except stones for dueling)!			"
