Early Access Review
								Much like Rockstar table tennis, the thought of a game just dedicated to one thing seems kind of strange, but when executed well, it's a whole lot of fun.Right now all there is is the table tennis, but I've read there will be more ping pong based things in the future, for the price you really can't beat the experience that is offered already.When I played it, there were 4 locations, my favorite was the roof-top outdoor area, I think I hit the ball into the streat and it caused a car to honk, though it may just have been well timed.The game has 4 single player modes, but my favorite one so far has got to be the Solopong mode. You literally are playing against yourself as time slows down and you are switched to the other side to hit your own ball back at youWicked fun.I really think that anyone who is intrested slightly in table tennis, if you enjoyed playing it in other games, or if you want to improve and try to take the 100 day challenge, this experience would probably help you to show improvement.As the game develops, I really see this becoming more of a must have!

Early Access Review
								This game is not functional enough to play a game of Ping Pong. It is really even too early for early access imo. The AI is the equivalent playing against a tree blowing in the wind. Not playable. On a lighter note, this game could be really something and I hope that it becomes available with proper AI soon because the environments are great and it's nice to be able to throw the ball up ourselves when serving. For now I will request a refund until I hear that the AI is at least as good as me (I suck) and the table color is forest green with white markings as it should be instread of the Monster sport drink green it is now.

								Although the actual feel of the game and the physics look promising, I cant recommend this game (yet) purely because there really isnt a game here yet.The self pong is a good idea but seems terribly difficult to execute, as you cant really tell which way the ball moving when the slow-mo ends.  The AI, as ackonwledged by the developer, is essentially not functional and, even if it were, there's no real scoring system.

								Dude, revert to core. This program needs to back into the oven. The AI does not work at the moment so effectively without mutl-player yet, there is nothing TO DO! Refund requested, better luck next time.			"

								Totally broken.  I know this is an early release game, but it's totally broken, and you shouldn't be charging a penny for this game in its current state.  Get some of the features to work, and then offer it again when you're polishing and bug fixing, not figuring out how to make a game.			"

								The AI in this game is border-line ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They'd have been better served by placing a wall on the opposite end of the table that could add momentum to your shots and return them. Literally, the paddle just moves to block your shot. It doesn't return the ball with any sort of aim or force. It's unplayable.			"

								A dedicated devoloper who listens to the comunity i foresee many improvemnts and features to come. as with most early acsess there is a long way to go. With a lot of comunity input on what you would like to see in a table tennis we can have a vr game worthy of ping pong: the animation.			"
