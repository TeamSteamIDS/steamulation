												Awaiting refund on this one, a shocking game, with occasional crashes. It looks terrible and sounds terrible, with weird 3rd Reich music, ideal for an SS Goose Step parade but not a soccer management game.Should have known better with all the poor reviews, but I thought with a new version released each year, refinements and improvements would be made. I hazard a guess that hasn't happened and they're just re-releasing the same ugly, flawed bore fest annually.Mercifully it took be a lot less than the 2 hours play time to be eligible for refund, for me to realise this game is a complete pile of horse♥♥♥♥.Since imo the last good Football Manager was the 2012 version, I've been hankering for a  90's style simple soccer management game, didn't have to look amazing, but had the playability factor of a Premier Manager or even one of the myriad of excellent ZX Spectrum simple soccer management games. This was nowhere near, and totally overpriced.This is awful, it's impossible to buy a player in a higher division... Save yourself £16.99, and give Club Manager 2017 a miss.			"
