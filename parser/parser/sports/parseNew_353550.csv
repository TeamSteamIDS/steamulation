												Before I continue, I will mention this is a rough recommend. A low recommend, if you will. In The House of Caravan, you spend the game exploring a house, you have limited lighting, and must make use of matches to light things in the environment, and a flashlight with limited battery life (I only managed to find a couple of batteries during the game). You mostly go around, looking and collecting items for puzzles, and keys to unlock doors. It's a first-person adventure game where you freely walk around, and has some slight horror tones, though nothing particularly scary happens (there's two light jump scares and some strange audio cues at points, and the house starts shaking at random intervals, but nothing particularly spooky happens from it).The house is nicely designed, and is fun enough to explore. Some of the puzzles are a bit of fun, none are too hard and most are easily solved. There's some physics when you pick things up. Some of the music is nice. The story isn't bad, but there isn't anything remarkable about it either. Game is on kind of the short side, probably taking someone 90-120 minutes to complete it. There are optional documents laying around you can pick up which have voiced dialogue talking more about the background of the game.If you can get it for a cheap price and don't mind a sort of light adventure game, it's worth playing. There are much better game's than it in the same sort of genre, but for a cheaper price it's not a bad bet. There are a few niggles with it, I witnessed some frame drops, and a few glitches of me dropping something on the floor and it flinging me into the air a bit, but nothing too bad and some light polish could easily fix this. Some audio volume elements were also a little low in my opinion.If you want to explore a house with some light puzzles in it, then it's decent. If not your cup of tea, you won't be missing anything amazing by skipping out on it.			"

												Story begins in mansion, where you woke up in a room on the floor. You remember, that you were captured by man, on your way from school. It's a first-person adventure game. This game is just about exploring house and rooms. Yes, there are some puzzles but they are not that too hard. You can have flashlight (it's limited but you can find batteries in house). Then there we have matches, which can light candles in rooms. Be careful and open each cabinet because you can find parts of the puzzles (photos, books). The game has a terrifying sounds (opening cabinets is quite scary) but it's not a horror game. However, there are some scary moments (something falls on the ground). House is really cozy. Thanks to fireplaces, photos and paintings of family you feels like at home. The story isn't bad but there is always something that could be even better. Voices are seriously perfect. I always listened to reading of letters till the end. Playing time is really short. I don't know why but House of Caravan is really similar to game ""Amnesia"". Glitch here and glitch there. Game has a lot of glitches. Things often get stuck in walls, tables, floors. Even happened to me that I was standing in a drawer and i have seen floor over me.+ graphics+ scary sounds+ easy puzzles+ voices- glitches- playing time			"

												House of Caravan is a perfect example of games being more than a simple gameplay. You won't run from monsters, track down a serial killer or lose your sanity, but you will become immersed in a surprisingly very well-written drama with great visuals (maybe a bit too dark but still great).Of course there is a lack of action in this game, but being immersed in such deep way to the story being told, I didn’t missed it at all. I had fun playing this the game, specially the end part that comes with the credits as the voiceover made me understand some things I missed at first, and left me wanting to know more about the Caravan’s universe, when we will see House of Caravan 2?

												This is a two hour long jaunt around a 13-room, 4-bath family house in search of answers and keys. It sports three 'vexing' puzzle types: a complete-the-circuit, a piece-the-torn-up-note-back-together, and a find-the-secret-code-in-the-old-photograph; each of which is repeated once making up a grand total of six puzzles. Scattered throughout the house are ham-fisted 'letters' revealing the whos, wheres, and whys of your predicament, read out in the most tone-deaf manner imaginable. The house itself is beautiful, if a little dark, and full of the most useless items to briefly pickup and break or to simply trip over and shoot right into the roof. Though indistinguishable from any other, some items are very useful, most of them being keys to the various locked rooms. Boxes of matches and batteries for your flashlight can also be found, implying there would be anything but mild annoyance waiting for you should you fail to ration these resources. If there was some looming specter in the shadows, I certainly never found it.House of Caravan isn't bad game, it just never got around to being a good one. It has the amateurish feel of a B-horror movie and even a little of that genre's charm. If you're willing to stumble around a bit and manage to find the game for less than 50 cents, it might even be worth your time... but just barely.			"

												A pretty short game, but well worth the $6. Not really horror, but an atmospheric, creepy game much more like ""Gone Home"". The puzzles are pretty strightforward, there were one or two that had me scratching my head, but all in all a good game. My only real complaints are that it could use a bit more optimization, and some of the physics on the items are a bit wonky. Recommended!			"

House of Caravan is a first-person adventure game. You were kidnapped and taken to a mansion. To find a way out of the mansion, you'll need to explore all the rooms, gather items and solve puzzles. This is a very basic game of mystery, exploration and puzzling: the mystery is nothing special but like all adventure game mysteries it beckons to be solved nonetheless you'll either find a way into the next room or find two or three keys to other rooms so the game is not completely linear but it comes close there are only 6 puzzles and they are not hard at allMost of the negative reviews do have a point. It would have been better if the character's walking speed was a bit higher. If you want the Steam Achievements for collecting all the items and all the letters that tell the story, you will open an afwul lot of drawers. There are only 3 types of puzzles, each of which you'll encounter twice, and experienced puzzlers won't find them challenging at all.But it's not all bad. House of Caravan has decent graphics for an indie game. The voice acting isn't half bad, especially for an indie game. The game manages to create a spooky atmosphere that piques one's interest to see what you will find in the mansion and how the game will end. You have to take House of Caravan for what it is. A short indie adventure game that has you exploring a mansion while you learn why you're there. It's one of those games you should never pick up unless it's heavily discounted (at least -80%), even if the genre appeals to you. I bought House of Caravan for 19 cents and for that I got two hours of adventuring through a spooky mansion, so I'm content. And from that perspective I do recommend this game.			"

												House of Caravan is a first person exploration game that drops you in the middle of a mystery with the intention of trying to escape. The question becomes, will you escape, or are you trapped forever? This first person exploration game has a few puzzles and lot of things to explore. You start in a house and must explore the house to figure out why you are there and the mystery surrounding your circumstances. Honestly there are few bugs in the game that I noticed. Occasionally my character would 'jump' if I did something weird like opened a drawer and looked up in some weird fashion, but overall, the game was a very smooth experience that I didn't expect at all. Seeing as the game has been bundled, I was not expecting such a nice experience. Sound: The background music is rather appropriate and ominous which makes sense as you're trying to figure things out and you're not quite sure how bad things will get. The individual sound assets seemed very fitting and I never questioned them. Your character will respond to certain prompts with one phrase over and over again, which gets mildly irritating as there is no variation, but it's completely ignorable. One thing I really enjoyed was the voice acting for certain things. I could take a break during certain segments and listen to it while I took care of some small task at my desk. Graphics: A lot of time was put into making a full experience here. While the graphics may not be the best in the world, I can definitely say that they tried their best to make a complete experience. For the price tag, I have zero issues with them. Kudos to the dev. Story: The story is rather well put together. You discover bits of it as you explore and it's rather well done. A few bits could be a little more fluid, but really no complaints at all. It was rather enjoyable to find out what had happened and why between solving mysteries and puzzles. Controls: Zero complaints. Though I would have liked a bit faster running speed, it's really nothing to stress about. Everything pretty much makes sense and works. The rotation speed of objects is a little slow, but I don't really know why you'd care, unless you want to inspect everything up close and see it from every angle. Personally wasn't a factor for me. Overall: 6.9/10 - Honestly the game is very good for what it is. Even though the game has been bundled in the past, I don't see any reason not to spend $5 on it. I think the developers did a great job on this game and deserve support. It's a cohesive gaming experience that immerses you into the world of the protagonist and challenges you with some fun puzzles in between your explorations. A very nice experience.			"

												House of Caravan is a short atmospheric puzzle game that provides the player with a few hours of gametime in which the player will be exploring a mansion and solving various puzzles. Bugs are by no means frequent, but may occur and force you to restart your progress. The game overall manages to provide the player with enough substance to justify a purchase.			"

												Tentative positive review.  I LOVE ""explore the old house while figuring out what happened there"" games.  And this one does quite a bit right.  The actual story content is short and lacks detail, but remains solid and interesting.  The graphics and atmosphere, in still images, are brilliant.  However...I don't know what game engine was used to make this, but it's an awful fit.  The physics in play is frequently inappropriate and distracting.  Your character clips onto random surfaces like open drawers and any miscellaneous stuff strewn about.  As a result, the camera seems so shakey that you might feel some slight motion sickness by the end.  Occasionally, completely ridiculous things happen, like getting caught up in a tapestry and being launched up to hit your head against the ceiling.  The game includes flashlights that run out of batteries and a finite supply of matches.  Neither is really in short supply, which means this is just a pointless annoyance.  You're just reluctant to use these things, which distracts you from the good part of the game: intense exploration.  Puzzles are well designed, but poorly implimented.  For about half, your character refuses to begin until you've found a handful of nearby objects.  That would be fine, except your character is unwilling to tell you what he imagines you still need beyond phrases like ""I need something.""As a plus, I find the game's estimate of ""60-90 minutes on a first playthrough"" to be weirdly modest.  If you don't have a walkthrough propped up in front of you the whole time, I'd really expect it to be double that, at least.It really was fun.  And it's hardly expensive.  Just expect it to feel a little rough around the edges in a handful of ways.			"

												It has become very difficult to find good adventure games in this day and age, yet I feel this brief game has given me a taste of a forsaken genre. That alone speak volumes, if you knew me.House of Caravan is a fairly short game which might be completed in a single sitting. Two of the five achievements are optional, and completing all five may be done in as little as two hours total. There are a handful of puzzles, none of which should prove very difficult.Visually, this game is rather atmospheric, and the annoyingly low levels of light are offset by a flashlight that you will only occasionally need. Matchboxes containing single matches are found in abundance, and you will have a surplus even after lighting all of the candles... if you even choose to light them. Replacement batteries may be found for the flashlight, although you will likely never need them.The story is almost completely contained in a series of 14 documents, and the rest is in the opening and ending sequences. There are no horror elements or jumpscares to this game, a fatal flaw inherent in almost all adventure hybrids these days. Instead, there are simply a few minor earthquakes presumably caused by the house settling. I feel the programmer threw them in to appease the jumpscare fanatics.If I have one gripe about this game beides the length, it would have to be the controls. Simple and mostly intuitive, selecting inventory items for use can sometimes be a pain. You will also occasionally get stuck on doors if you leave them open, although this is more of a nuisance than any real problem, as you can either navigate around the door or simply shut it.There really isnt much else to say about House of Caravan. It's a short run and evidence the adventure genre still works great on its own. A sequel would be lovely due to the very short length and limited replayability. However, the price is what you would pay for a simple lunch, which I find reasonable for the overall quality of the game. 9/10			"

												House of Caravan is a game that lacks an identity and has been poorly designed on a fundamental level. As a first game for a studio it's not horrible, and the price is reasonable for the amount of playtime, but for their next game I hope the developers learn that opening drawers is not the best gameplay. The good:Solid scope for a first game, they did not take on too much.Coherent style in the graphics, and enough variation in models/props to avoid being repetitive.Hidden doors in a mansion. Who does not like hidden doors?The mansion itself seems to have gotten some love, even though it does not feel like people have actually lived in it.The bad:The writing is terrible on a fundamental level. Who writes a letter about a murder that they commited to the person who asked them to? and who keeps said letter in a drawer in a garage? signed with both names? The letters are clearly not written to a person, they are just a tool to tell the player what they should know. The puzzles are varied, but their sollutions are sometimes less than elegant, and essentially you just walk around opening drawers until you find the right items. You don't feel smart when you succeed, which you should always aim for as a game designer.VO is not the worst I've heard, but it does nothing to elevate the writing.The ending is abrupt, and we are left with no sense of how the main character felt about the whole thing.The repetitive voice lines for trying to open locked doors and finding match boxes are super enoying and shatter any immersion. In Conclusion: As a first game from a small studio it's not the worst I've played, but when you brag about having worked on the Witcher etc, I expect a more polished experience with better fundamentals of what the player actions are. Also: sprint is too slow, walking is too fast.			"

												Had way more fun smashing pots and random things in the house then taking the story seriously.Also kept hiding TP in the Loo and flushing it. Could not take this seriously. The atmosphere is supposed to be there, but its fun just to mess around with objects and see what happens. Many items glitch and or disappear. It honestly feels like what would be a Slender type game with the idea that something is chasing or seems to be chasing you. However when you read the first couple of documents or rather, have them read to you, things become much more clear rather quickly. Controls are awful, they can be adjusted to an extent. Mainly purchased this to support a genre i would like to see more games out of. I do not regret my purchase, but it certainly feels like more effort could have been put into this game. The house and artwork themselves are rather nicely done.			"

""I need something""  o_0...and that ""something"" is a Hint button.I didn't find the gameplay very intuitive, the controls were a little clunky at times, and I can't imagine making it all the way though this game without referring to the walkthrough in the Guides section at least a few times. But the graphics were good and I really enjoyed moving freely around the environment (vs. the still-frames/animations situation that you often find in similarly themed mystery games). Once I just accepted that I was going to have to refer to the walkthough every now and again, I was able to enjoy it enough to give it a mild recommend.If you're okay with an occasional walkthrough reference and slightly different gameplay than you'd find with the typical point & click mystery game - and even factoring the valid criticisms in the reviews - you might still find it worth a play through. Get it on sale.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.5 hrs although I've played at least 3 hrs and have completed the game.			"

												""House of Caravan"" is a fun, little game, where you have to explore a house and solve puzzles to move on. There are nearly no jumpscares, despite of that there`s a really scary atmosphere. It`s possible to sprint, crouch and jump. You have limited resources of matches and flash light batteries. That makes the game interesting, I think. The puzzles aren`t too hard. Sometimes they are a bit easy, but usually average. Often you have to open safes to gain access to new parts of the house. I really liked the puzzles and this principle. Unfortunately the game is sometimes buggy and I hope the bugs get fixed soon(you can even skip one part of the house). Additionally the length is about 90 minutes. The price is really cheap. All in all I really enjoyed the ""House of Caravan"". If the bugs are fixed, i would recommend it!			"

Pages discovered during your exploration, brings the story onwards. Atmosphere, graphic, music and sounds are just great.			"

												To be an indie game made by a pretty small team it's a very nice game, also fits well with that price,It has a well made atmoshpere, and now with the first patch solved a couple things that community asked for.The only thing maybe i would say its about the duration or optimization , but about the optimization has improved and runs better now with the first patch , also got some options to tweak now, maybe more in the future but not complaining about it. and for the duration its a good duration for an indie game and for the price they are asking, but always gamers want more and more :P			"

												House of Caravan is a decent game if you were to get it on sale. Otherwise it's not worth picking up. It's quite short and only has a couple minor jump-scare moments. The majority of the game is looking through a plethora of cabinets and drawers trying to find items in order to allow you to solve the next puzzle. The puzzles are a little time consuming, but easy to figure out and get repititious quickly.			"

												So i went in this game not knowing to much about it feels a lot like the game going home so if you liked that this is similar but also has a bit of Amnesia feel to it because you can interact with a lot of stuff.Like if you want to smash a vase or plate on the ground you can totally do that lol The story was pretty good more of a drama with a creepy feel to it.Only thing i noticed about the game is could use a bit more optimization just in the one room that has the trap door frames really jumped around in there for some reason.Would totally be down for a sequel That would be awesome :) If you want to check out my gameplay on it that would be awesome :D

												The two greatest advantages of House of Caravan are, perhaps, a nice picture and a good atmosphere. The house of the Caravan family came out very alive, there is a separate charm in these dark corners and carved furniture, and the sound accompaniment quite harmoniously completes the atmosphere with rustles, creaks. The puzzles in the game are very simple, perhaps even too simple, and the hints are too obvious that it does not require any cunning deductions from you. The game is short and simple. A spoiler for those who are afraid: there are no monsters in the game, only terrible sounds.			"

												An exploration game with trivial point-and-click adventuring, insignificant puzzles, and minor jump scares. The mansion is pretty and the visuals very atmospheric, but unfortunately the story is uninteresting, obvious, and very poorly told. The voice acting is very amateurish and breaks whatever atmosphere is created by the visuals.There's some raw talent behind this game, but the production team really needs to sit down and design an engaging story before building a complete game.

												I liked this game enough to give it a recommended vote, but I was on the fence about it.The game ran smoothly for me and I thought the atmosphere and gameplay was well done for a game that is on sale for under $1 very often.The puzzles you come across are for the most part simple to figure out and if you get stuck there are more than enough walkthroughs online.If you enjoy first person horror puzzle games, and you get this on a super sale, then sure, add it to your library.  It is a short game though, so don't expect more than 1-2 hours out of the gameplay.			"

A bit annoying since you don't have a clue on what to use and/or what to do next.Overall, I had a fun time playing the game. The house is really creepy and the story will get distubingly interesting as it progresses.Here's my take on the House of Caravan :) See if you like it.

												House of Caravan is a game where you drawers until you find the thing. For some reason you throw plates around which is cool i guess. The torch or ,flashlight as the annoying child would say, doesnt have a battery indicater so instead it just kinda slowly dims until you find a drawer with a battery in it, so thats a thing i guess. After you found the thing you walk around trying to use the thing on the many other things and every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time this little brat says ""I need something"". This is especially annoying when used on a door because he could just say its locked instead of being immensely perplexed at what kind of magical object can open a door.I paid 39p for this game and i feel ripped off the only thing this kid needs is an expanded vocabulary			"

I received this game in a $20 bundle of 40-something games; most of them were complete trash but House of Caravan got me hooked and I played through it all in one sitting. It isn't a long game and the puzzles aren't brain-melting but the story keeps you going and for such an indie game the house is very detailed. You can open every drawer and cupboard, pick up almost every object and examine it... it reminds me a lot of Gone Home but with a darker story.If you're looking for a quick 2-hour puzzle game in the vein of Amnesia, check this one out!

												House of Caravan is an atmospheric puzzle game with a touch of psychological horror.The game is quite short, if you go straight to solve the puzzles and collect the items needed to proceed you may probably beat the game less than an hour. The reason why it took me nearly 2 hours is that I spent a lot of time messing with the objects I picked up or wandering around the house appreciating the pictures hanging on the wall, which I don't regret because I actually had a good time immersing myself in the environment and atmosphere the game provided.The story is mainly about the bond in the Caravan family, which didn't impressive me much but solid enough as a background of the game. You'll play as Lester, a distant son of the Caravans who was kidnapped by a stranger on the way home, waking up to find out that he was trapped in the house of Caravan and must find a way out. While playing the game, you'll collect letters and documents that tell the past events of the Caravan family and reveal the truth behind the abduction.The game has a somber and eerie atmosphere owe to its graphics and sounds. First of all, the game looks good, maybe not as good as the Vanish of Ethan Carter or Layers of Fear considersing it's probably low-budget but still has a good feel in it due to the attention to details and artistic appreciation. Most of the areas in the mansion are either dimly lit by candlelights or completely dark so you'll need to rely on your power consuming flashlight to explore before you manage to find a lamp which is the legitimate light source in the game. In the meantime, you'll need to conserve the power of your flashlight because it runs out fairly quick and there're only a couple of additional batteries hidden in some drawers, but there're plenty of matchboxes scattered around the house for you to ignite the candles though, which helps quite a bit. Usually, games with dark environment that lack of proper lighting annoy me a lot, but this game is fine by me.The background music and sound effects of the game are great. You'll hear creaking sounds by doors and floor, mysterious growling, or rumble of the house every now and then, which can make you paraniod because they happened abruptly and when you look around, nothing actually changed. However, these sounds can become quite repetitive once you get use to them and realize that nothing's gonna happen to you, thus losing their psychological effects. It's also worth to mention that there're several jumpscares in the game, which did worked on me because I was unprepared and I'm glad that the devs didn't overuse them. Overall, the sound effects contribute a lot to the atmosphere and keep you on edge throughout the game.The gameplay is simple. You find keys to unlock rooms, collect letters, find puzzles, sovle the puzzles or search for items required to solve them. Puzzles are quite easy, for example, piecing torn notes together, spying photos with magnifying glass for codes, or connecting wires. You can pick up a tons of objects and rotate or zoom in on them, pictures, newspapers, books, jars, sacks, chairs, etc. Most of the objects are useless but it's fun to deliberately break a plate or ink bottle once in a while, sometimes accidently. After all, the freedom to interact can always add to the gameplay, especially for this type of games.The optimization may need a bit of work but the general performance is good and I didn't come across any bug during the two-hour span. My biggest complaint about the game is the voice acting, it's not terrible but feels stiff and emtionless, kinda breaks the immersion for me.Well, all in all, I totally enjoyed playing this game. If you want an atmosphereic experience with some puzzles to solve, House of Caravan can be a nice treat for you.			"

												Good game-this is why we love PC games and the indie adventure scene - an abundance of intriguing titles. Sure some may complain about the short length but I would rather play an engaging game than one which is artificially extended and gets boring. Caravan has great graphics and voice acting and is well polished for an indie game-a few jumpscares in there too, even though the Caravan mansion is far away from the Bakers` bayou shack			"

												It's basically a HO Game. You have to search each room, until you find an item/clue how to progress. There are a few puzzles in the game, which are not very hard to solve. It's also a rather short game which can be done 1-2 hours on your first playthrough + about a half hour extra time, when you want all achievements (you have to search a lot eventually to find everything).I would recommend it for the (creepy) atmosphere and nice design.

												Cons:Control sucks.Instructions are vague. You got lost at first puzzle. Again even at the second one.Narrator vocals are funny. Kind of reminded me of Google translation or what.Story is rather weak.Control really sucks.Pros:Graphics and details are good.Nice atmoshpere.You can break whatever things you like, plates, bottles, frames...No monsters come from nowhere hunting you down all the time(which I feared most when playing Amnesia). Only disturbing sounds and shakes.NO MONSTERS is THE BEST PART.I have to say the first time I entered game I really determined to give it a thumb down, cause I bought it for an original price but it just looked like something unfinished. There're not enough notes for what to do next and I got lost for times. But after finishing I thought I did enjoy the exploration. This big house has the atmosphere after all. There're no disturbing ghosts or monsters so I could focus on puzzle solving. Though the control is really shxtty. And the story is not impressive.Recommended for those who like walking stimulation or just want to kill some time.			"

However, I got used to gameplay after awhile and sort of enjoyed the game by the end.  But the problems remain and at full price I just can't recommend it; at the price I paid (50 cents) its OK. BTW the hellreader achievement might not be working - one of the letters appears to be missing.  And if anyone was alarmed by the 5+ hours of gameplay at least 2-3 hours was the game idling.			"

												Things I learned playing House of Caravan:- books are very nervous, they tend to shake when taken up- books can also frequently fall _into_ walls, closed cupboards and armchairs- be careful when you gently move the book - you may make large armchairs fall- one needs to open all drawers to find answers - 30 times is just about enough (per room)- when you drop a small sack under your feet, it may be impossible to step over it and you will have to go around- a child who is unable to see what's in the top drawers without jumping will have no problems connecting electrical circuits, and combining wires together- a child who is unable to come up with an idea to escape the house through a window (on the ground floor) will be able to investigate clues and solve puzzles that need analytical knowledge- each closed box has only one, specific for that box, way of brute force opening- in early XX century all murderers and kidnappers were informing their employers what they have done by mail signing with their full names- no keys are ever hidden in the jars (checked all of them)- windows tend to break, objects tend to fall without any specific reason at times- candles are very heavy and can never be taken with you, it's good that...- ... there are lots of matches, yet that seems to never cease to amaze me. A matchbox!Play Gone Home instead.			"

												While it's a rather short game, House of Caravan doesn't skip on atmosphere and the puzzles are a decent enough challenge, particularly those involving photographs, to keep you busy so that you don't blow through the entire thing too swiftly. The game also serves (as I understand it) as a prelude to unfortunately failed kickstarter project ""Death in Candlewood"" and offers a bit of flavor for the world they had built for that game. Whether or not that project ever sees completion, House of Caravan provides an interesting enough short mystery story to keep you interested as you move through the house trying to find a way out.

												Like in the vain of the new atmospheric adventure games this game is similar to what you get in The Park and Gone Home.Still here? Good.  Than like me you gravitate to these exploration and story based games.  And this story based game is all about the old school horror of Poe and similar writers. Taking much influence from the Fall of the House of Usher you find yourself as a young man in a decaying mansion that creaks and moans as you try to find a way out.

												Not a bad game for the price. though I'd hold out for a sale or a coupon. Not heavy on the story and the puzzles are somewhat intriguing but some of the voice acting could use a little work. Then again, what do you want for a $5 game. It looks pretty good, is somewhat atmospheric and only takes about 2 hours to complete. Also, like others have said, it's a pretty easy game to '100%'.			"

												I have only played 40 minutes of the game but within that 40 minutes I have came to the conclusion that this is better than a lot of full priced £10+ games on the market.  I got this for 15p and will finish through it eventually but for the money its worth it.  Several puzzles and semi good atmosphere.			"

												Well I do have to point out my review is based upon the fact that this game cost me 15p (15 pence) about a 6th of £1. It may as well have been free. That being said I really liked it. A slightly annoying feature is that certain things are not accessable until further progression. Nice simple atmosphere not very long game but a nice afternoon spent on it. Sometimes you just need a puzzle or two rather than a frag fest.			"

												Like in the vain of the new atmospheric adventure games this game is similar to what you get in The Park and Gone Home.Still here? Good.  Than like me you gravitate to these exploration and story based games.  And this story based game is all about the old school horror of Poe and similar writers. Taking much influence from the Fall of the House of Usher you find yourself as a young man in a decaying mansion that creaks and moans as you try to find a way out.  The story is told through letters you find along the way.  There are also keys to find and puzzles to solve.The sound is quiet good as it has that Vincent Price/ Edgar Allen Poe movie quality to it.

Games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter have proven that simple is fine, even good, so long as the story is compelling, but the house of caravan just does not deliver.

OverviewHouse of Caravan is a slow paced puzzle game, where you explore a mysterious mansion and solve puzzles to figure out how to get out.The game was fun, up until the point where I encountered a game breaking bug, about ten minutes from the end of the game. The developers have failed to respond, and I’ve yet to find a solution, so until that time comes, I can’t recommend the game, on the off chance it happens.ProsDecent graphicsInteresting story, mainly told through the documents you can findPuzzles aren’t overly complicatedConsEvery time you pick something up, your character comments. Picking up the 11th matchbox to hear him say “a matchbox” for the eleventh time is redundantPretty short for its pricePuzzles are repetitiveDoesn’t tell you anythingSummaryIt started out interesting until the bug. While doing an electrical puzzle (connect end to end), the switch pulled and my character said “perfect!” as if it was complete. I then went to pull the rod, but it didn’t work. Double checked the electric box, and I couldn’t interact with it, which led me to believe that yes, I actually did finish it.I reloaded my game, same thing. I quit the game, started it back up, loaded, and same issue; I just could not proceed. POTENTIAL SPOILER: For those who are curious, it’s at the entrance to the crypt, trying to open the jail door.I then decided to start a new game, then quit and load, but no, starting a new game overwrites the save. The game did not inform me that starting new would erase my save, and I didn’t even attempt to save after starting fresh. Not that the game is overly long (easily finished in half an hour), but I didn’t feel like redoing all that just to see two more rooms and the ending.Until the developer corrects this issue, I can’t recommend this as a buy. Give it a try if you get it in a bundle, or you’re somehow given a free copy. Should this be corrected, I’ll gladly revise this review in favor of the developer.			"

												A fair game at best. Graphically unappealing and very dark. The music was relaxing and movement was rough and very little direction to solve some of the puzzles, though they weren't particually challenging. The hardest part was finding items in the dark environment. Short and pretty boring game, though some of the puzzles were cool and they were a few cheap scares in the game. Got this for .49 cents, so ok for that price, but not the 4.99 they are asking for. PLayed just over 3 hours to get all of the achievements.			"

												House of Caravan is an exploration game with puzzles. The game is set in the early 20th century and has a somewhat dark atmosphere, however I wouldnt classify it as horror. As you explore you will find notes that tell a story. However the one major issue I found with this was that at no point did I know what my characters name was. Thus it was hard to really understand what my role was in the game other than to try and find a way out. If you enjoy exploration games, give this a whirl. Just dont expect a deep storyline.			"

												The original title for House of Caravan was ""House of 1,000 Drawers"" until the makers of the House of 1,000 Doors games protested.  Though it looks like another creep-'em-up indie horror walking simulator, it would be better viewed as a ransacking simulator.  To find the letters revealing the backstory, and the items you'll need to progress, you're going to go through a lot of pieces of furniture with a lot of drawers and cupboards, every single one of which is functional, and most of which contain nothing of interest.  You can also pick up and manipulate a la Skyrim a whole host of objects, none of which have any purpose in advancing the plot.House of Caravan has a particularly well-rendered and plausible setting, right down to the presence of toilets.  It tells a traditionally Gothic sort of tale (in the literary sense, unconnected to pasty teens in black with too much eye makeup) with definite traces of Fall of the House of Usher[www.bartleby.com] in it.  The creators did a reasonably good job of creating the backstory and allowing it to gradually unfurl.  The modelling of the house is excellent.  Scare techniques are used sparingly and to good effect.Despite the skill in enviroment design, this game still has some notable weaknesses.  Your character, as mentioned, must spend far too long plodding around the house opening drawer after drawer after drawer to find the items you need.  There are only three kinds of puzzles in the game, each repeated twice, and none of them are remotely difficult.  The inventory system is annoying and poorly implemented.  I would like to see these developers create another game with a similar degree of technical skill, but with the addition of a UX specialist to the team, to help streamline the experience and iron out such issues.While my view of the game is decidedly mixed, it asks such a modest price that the flaws are more forgiveable, and the strong elements are worth experiencing. I recommend it.			"
