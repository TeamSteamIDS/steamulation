												I think we have true motorcycle simulation here. The attention to detail in both the physics and the graphics is beyond what I expected. I have never seen motorcycle simulation this accurate. I actually have to slow down to turn unlike the arcade motorcycly racers I grew up playing. This is awesome to say the least. I recommend this to everyone who wants and/or has a motorcycle.  I also recommend this to anyone who wonders why anyone would want a motorcycle.
