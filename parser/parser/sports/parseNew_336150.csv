												Virtual Pool 4 is simply the best pool simulation: the physics is spot on, plenty of different variations of pool game, nothing fancy, just plain pool.I would give it a perfect 10, but something was really disappointing.  I already bought Virtual Pool 4 from Celeris web site last year (played more than 100 hours with it).  But their DRM scheme is simply painful.  You cannot installed the game on multiple computer (your desktop and your laptop for example) because you would need to re-activate the game each time  you play on different computer.  Simply painful.I bought the Steam version hoping to get rid of this DRM nonsense, only to find out that VP4 would only start if the Steam client is online, even if you play solo.  So I can't play on my laptop when I am away and no internet connection is available.  Celeris may have produced the best pool simulator, they just ruined it with annoying DRM issued.In short, 10/10 for the best pool simulator, 0/10 to force users to be online all the time, even when playing solo.

												I bought this game 2 days ago, I have played 9 hours on it so far. The game has the ""feel"" of real pool. You can make shots without the need of a lined up aid aimer. I own Pool Nation, I played 68 hours on it, VP4 is 10 times more realistic. Pool Nation wins with higher res graphics, but VP4 has decent graphics, gameplay trumps graphics in this case for me. I have no problem finding real players in VP4's awesome lobby system, I can't describe how awesome the lobby is.... You walk into a room and if 2 people are playing, you play the winner. There were 50 people logged in to the lobby playing at all times in the 2 days I have owned this game. Tons of camera options, you can view the shot in almost any zoomed in view to make the ""feel"" match your own style of real play. Pool Nation on sale for 2 bucks is a steal, but VP4 is by far the better game for people who play/played real pool. I am giving it a 9 out of 10, I would love to see PN's high res graphics in this game, but it appears the pc specs will allow many more people to play VP4. The graphics aren't bad, they just aren't eye popping like PN.			"

												I'm loving this. The physics are great. Single player is fun and teaches you a LOT. My game is going to improve IRL for sure. There are a lot of modes (tourney, etc), games (8 ball, snooker, 9 ball, you name it), and difficulties etc. I'm having a blast already. Multiplayer is easy to set up and get in a game, and the crowd has been kind and social. Good game.Someone mentioned that the Online is only free for 1 year, and then $10 after that. Well, if I am still playing in a year $10 won't be much to renew another year subscription, so that isn't an issue. The other thing mentioned was that you can purchase better cues etc, in the online store... while they do help, they are not necessary to play online. For the price, I can see getting a lot out of this game even without any addition addons. Pool is timeless and this game lets you play it whenever you want.			"

												This is the best pool simulator on the market at the moment. I would love to see them polish this title up to today's graphics standards and add a comprehesive story mode that's actually engaging. Yet, when you want a game of pool on your computer that's as close to real life as possible... this is your game. I would love to see them put out Virtual Pool 5 and really rework the infrastucture of the game into something worthy of what is quite possibly the best pool physics simulation on the market today.

												I play VP4 for almost 2 years and a half. The quality of time I spent on it and nice people I met is priceless. I even started playing real life snooker league, something I would probably never start doing without VP4 experience. The game teaches you a lot  about pool and snooker and inspires you to start reaching real life goals. I recommend this to anyone who wants to experience something new in the world of video games.

												The Virtual Pool franchise has been going since  1995Vrtual  Pool 4 is the latest in Celeris next installment of the series.How to sum up Virtual Pool 4?  Yes its a game,but it goes far deeper than that when you break it down into its constituents.If you like simply to bang a few balls around against an AI player from time to time and set the game level to your specific choosing you can do so.If however you want to develop and learn about billiards and pool in general then it also can cater to your needs.From the Video totorials by Steve Daiking you can learn the very basics in the art and skill Of Pool to the more advanced positioning and cue ball control and once you think you have mastered that phase you may want to start a hustler career and gamble your bux against the Poolsharks at the various and sometimes seedy locations  available to you.You also have a varied and comprehensive  career mode at your disposal.Start of as a lowly amateur and see if you can progress your way through the ranks to take on what seems to be a brutal Champion level in the game.You have a trick shot mode,you can set a table and the balls the way you want and try perhaps to recreate a shot you seen one of your heroes play in the past.In short there is a whole host of things to keep yourself interested in the game,above all though this is not simply a game,its a learning tool that anyone who has a mind to can progress and advance their own understanding of how to shoot a ball and  and makes runs and start winning.Virtual Pool does all this with the best control,method of all,the mouse.Your mouse controls your cue stick,you draw the mouse back and push it forward to take a shot,it could not be simpler.Using the mouse is the simplest and best way to give you the weight and feel of a shot and its also through time has proved Celeris have got it right since way back in 1995 when Virtual Pool first saw the light of day.Other games of this nature have always used power bars and meters that take so much longer for you to set a shot up and actually hit a ball.Virtual Pool does not mess about and very quickly you will see that they got it right.It can improve your reallife game but only if you want it to as its down to what level you want or think you may be able to acheive,the sky is the limit as far as that goes.Ok some will say the graphics although a vast improvement on the fore runners in the series, they dont jump out at you like some other nicer looking games of that ilk.You may be right and there is still room for improvement as the game will be a work in progress and is being improved all the time.What  stands out by a country mile is the game play and once you have mastered all the key controls as that will take time I think you will find that Virtual Pool 4 has got all the rest beat in comparisonIts not simply a game its as true a simulation as you can possibly get on PC and for the time being still hold onto the title of Best Pool and Billiard sim of all.If you are new to this type of game please dont judge it after a few hours of struggling around and feeling your not getting anywhere.Use the tracking lines as a help if you need to,use the ghost ball to show you where to hit the ball.The most important thing is to give it time and if you want to learn and progress,you will and it will grow on you all the more.You will keep coming back to it and you will develop as a player and you also will get a better understanding of the art of billiards and Pool in General.You have tried the rest....now try the best. Virtual Pool 4 Its what sitting up to 4 am in the morning is all about.			"

												Most realistic cuesport sim ever... and that's what this is really; a sim. If you're into cuesports in any capacity this is the game for you. It has its problems, and they are being fixed albeit slowly. Pros - + Almost completely realistic ball physics. Any shot you can play on a real table you can play here, apart from a few (See cons)+ Most variations of popular cuesports available. + Nice online community - most players are GOOD :P + Will definitely help your real game, especially by watching other people play. + Addictive once you get the feel for the mouse stroke+ SO MUCH FUN when you're in a tourney with good people. Cons - - Some things aren't modelled correctly. Snooker pockets are wrong. Cushion compression on the pockets isn't modelled so you can't play hard shots (a staple of snooker) into the back of the pocket... you have to hit the drop perfectly. It also means in 9ball if you get stuck straight on a ball frozen to the rail you can't do the trick of shooting cushion first. Throw is modelled (slow thin cuts with draw push off line) but it is exaggerated and unrealistic... will frustrate some players. - Slow update process. It's a one man team as far as I'm aware. Hire somebody! - Online community for the most part are nice but you will be destroyed until you know what you're doing... I've been playing this game for about 7 years but for a newbie they might get frustrated. People pull no punches. - Graphics aren't the best, but very serviceable. - Currently community is too small - steam realease has helped this and it's getting bigger all the time! - The game is NOT CLEAR that multiplayer is more or less $10 a year... I don't mind and this is nothing when you consider that if you like cuesports you will be playing this game for life, but it is not well advertised at all. If you like pool or snooker, you can't go wrong. Puts every other game to shame. 9/10, even with the cons!  "

												Virtual Pool 4 - It really makes your game betterAfter playing the hole franchise I really need to say that, in my opinion, this is the best game ever made. It simulates in a perfect manner the real cue games and offers a true and immersive experience for any gamer out there.Story time...once upon a time I was very excited about playing snooker for real. But having some limited financial possibilities and a snooker table being a must for top performance, I started to play Virtual Pool, hoping that it will improve my average game. Soon I was going to be the first junior champion of my country, by only playing a computer game. Sounds silly but it's absolutely true. Years later when I became the owner of a real snooker table and after winning the senior national championship, I still play Virtual Pool for fun. Transposing from the snooker table to the computer game comes natural. The angles are all the same. The effects and cue action are a little more pronounced in the game, as we are dealing with 1s and 0s here, and not real physics. Also, impossible shots can be achieved in the game, while in real life the table's architectural design will reject some of the object balls. Very, very few flaws, that naturally come from the limited possibilities of today's gaming engines and design tools. Except for the technique - not needing to keep a stable position with firm hand bridge and feet in the right angles, head straight with chin touching the cue; no feather movement back and forth, no movement of the eyes between the cue ball, object ball and pocket - this game simulates the real deal frighteningly accurate. It's sick and I can assure you that what they say is absolutely true: It really makes your real game better!I would like to thank Celeris developers (I always do when I have the chance) for bringing to the public this masterpiece. And of course, many thanks to Steam for making this game available. I waited a long time for it and I would of bought it eventually from the original website, but Steam is better.Enjoy your 147 potting zone! :D			"

												Despite the fact that the game it's great, I can't recommend it for one single reason. The game can't be played in offline mode and the developers already confirmed that it won't change because simply they don't want to change this.Why the people that have an ilegal copy can play in offline mode and the ones who paid and support this game don't have this option... A pool game with single mode requiring internet connection to play, seriously?PD: I bought the game because I wanted to support the devs. In that moment they wrote that the offline mode would be enabled in the future.

You don’t have to be a pool shark to appreciate the wide range of options that this game has to offer.  The training videos will help newcomers further in getting their feet wet.  It’s the type of game that you can jump into for five or ten minutes or spend hours playing, depending on your mood.			"

												By far the most realistic pool simulation on the market. Played it for a long time before it was ever on steam. As close to real pool as you can get and there is also snooker in there for good measure. With your purchase you will get access to the offline game which has career mode etc and you will also get access to the multiplayer portion of the game but be aware it's $10 to be a premium member which enables you to play in tournaments and will give you V$1000 which is the in game currency for entering tournaments , buying cues etc. You can play multiplayer without it but only basic things like play with a friend. You cant enter tournaments unless your premium. I though this should be mentioned as many people will be unaware of that. I recommend the game if you enjoy pool as this is by far the best on the market and has been for years. Not to keen on paying for premium multiplayer but hopefully the fee will be removed.			"

This is the only way to keep the dev team fed.So keep it up, Celeris!			"

												This classic version has been around for a while, and makes a welcome arrival on Steam. The usual varieties of Pool (and rule variations) are available and while it is simple to pick up, it takes time to become skilled. It really can improve your actual game in real life, although the AI skill 'rubber-banding' gets quite noticeable when you are good. The graphics are fine, and the physics realism is high.You can save a lot of time offline by pressing Z immediately after any shot, to skip to the point where the balls are at rest. Playing online therefore feels nowhere near as quick, and you have to play more carefully and strategically.If you enjoy pool, this simply has to be in your PC games collection. 5/5.*** IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to play online unrestricted, you have to pay a tiny bit extra, but it's still not much compared to paying for access to real-life tables. ***			"

This is the only American pool game worth your time. The physics feel genuine. The tables and cues all feel subtly different as they should.

												Probably the best pool simulator I've ever played. The developers claim this to be the most realistic pool game on the market, and it shows. Physics are incredible, with lots of customizable options to fine-tune performance. Many game types, online multiplayer, and career modes. Hustler career mode is my favorite. Rise through the ranks of the underground circuit, defeat bosses, earn cash and buy custom cues. Interested in advancing your playstyle or wanting to learn how to make a clever shot? Real-life pool expert Steve Daking will show you how with a series of video tutorials.If you want silly gimmicks and eye candy then look elsewhere. VP4 is for players wanting to improve their game.

												Hey, what can I say, it's a game that at its very core is what it says it is.  Virtual Pool is a game I spent a good amount of time playing back when it first came out all those years ago.  I didn't even realize there was a 4th out in 2015.  I'm glad I bought it.  It's honestly, not much different from the first one but the added graphics are a great enhancement.I feel like my aiming in this new version is a bit more accurate as well and that always turned me off from the first edition.Overall, if you're looking for a pool game, look no further.  This one is the best in the billiards world.  Oh and that long standing claim that it'll improve your real world game?  It's true.  It really does.			"

												I recommend this game, but it could still be improved in some areas. Please note, I have put many hours into the non Steam version. I opted for this version to get auto updates. The original Virtual Pool (1995) game still holds up today, and is very similar physics wise to its newer iterations, VP3 and VP4.Needs improvement/some suggestions for the developer;1. Menus feel quite clunky and dated. To get back to the main menu you have to hit the word ""Cancel"". I dont know how many times i hit OK and end up starting a new game. Just doesnt feel intuitive. (why not have a 'back to main' button on the left side of the screen?)2. Why cant I play snooker on a smaller table? VP3 allowed snooker to be played on a pub pool table. Its fun to do sometimes.3. Improved audio feedback. Theres nothing more satisfying than hearing an object ball ""crack"" the back of a pocket. This is missing on the snooker table no matter how hard I cue. Tables, pockets and rooms should sound different. It helps with ambience and immersion. Very important in a game like this. Sound shouldnt be overlooked. 4. Backgrounds need some more work, I turn them off as they seem lazily tacked on at the end. These are just some suggestions, for a game i still enjoy very much. Despite these, I still highly recommend.  "

												This game is helping me play billiards and pool at pubs. The physics seem very legit. This is a very good program if you need to do some practise shots. It is also a nice cheat sheet to bring with you to a bar if you want to play some fun different games like 1 pocket or cribage. You should really pick up this game if you want to get better at billiards and pool.			"

												I'm only interested in Snooker. That's it. The snooker aspect of this game , as far as I have experienced so far after a few hours of play, is excellent. End of story.After years looking for a decent Snooker-Sim and not finding it, Virtual Pool 4 provides that experience I have always been seeking. Over the years I have played them all, including some of the recent Pool/Snooker offerings that fail miserably in their attempt to provide a decent experience.OK so it's early days for me with this software but so far after several hours it meets my expections and ticks all the boxes. It's a game I want to play because it is fun, challenging and very well made. What more can you say?Would recommend, especially while on Steam Sale.			"

												Having played pool in competition for a few years my opinion about this game might be a bit focused on the sport itself, more so than the gameplay element. The simulation aspect is very good and indeed I have great fun playing a few matches every day, just because in heart I am still somewhat of a pool addict. The gameplay elements however might be a bit lacking for someone looking for more of a in-depth game, rather than just playing pool. Careers for example are essentially just a large number of matches, without much variation. The different tables (size and cloth) are nice tough. I haven't touched the multi-player and I believe the online part would require a few euro/dollar per year subscription after the first year. Don't get me wrong, I get much enjoyment from playing the careers in pool and snooker (speaking of snooker, the simulation is very good). If you're  hoping for an action packed experience with intense and sophisticated career development, you might get bored after a while. If you just want to play some pool without leaving your house/chair then I can wholeheartedly recommend this product.			"

												This is the best pool game you can buy if you are serious or not :) about the sport,i tried many pool games but always return to virtual pool, reasons are :gameplay/physics are the best out there with very easy mouse controls (feels natural).It might not have the latest gfx fx but that means it plays very good even on old hardware and intergrated gfx cards (so i can enjoy it on my laptop with intel HD 3000 too).Has career mode and many game types with a lot of options if you want to customize your game,many mouse control options to fine tune it to your liking,nice help manual and tutorial videos,ability to record/save/load your game and replay shots with adjustable speed,it has so many features you can't go wrong with virtual pool! it's the most complete pool experience you'll find on any platform.Wishlist : lan option/direct ip and not just internet multiplayer - AI improvements (more human like) - better story mode - improved background art - some interface improvements like you don't have to change view for call shots so you can make all selections from 3D view for smoother  gameplay			"

Tons of game options, including Snooker.  And multiplayer support.  They used to have a tag line that this game would make you better at real pool, and I agree. If you love pool, you should play this game.  There is a multplayer version available for free on steam.  The single player version includes multiple campaigns and various AI difficulties.			"

												The legendary pool simulation game releases it's fourth installment after fifteen years since it's last. It still holds it's charm and still holds it's legitimacy. That legitimacy is through it's physics. It feels and plays like a real pool game. There are now many competitors in the mix with their own spin on billiards. Pool Nation was okay with it's flash and flare, where it looked incredibly pretty and provided some fun with it's own physics.But if you want a more realistic billiard simulation, Virtual Pool is the game for this.

												The core ball mechanics are wonderful: shooting by stroking the mouse, the physics on the table, the graphics of the balls. All brilliant. But: everything surrounding the game looks like it hasn't changed since 1997, and it's really, really basic, and has aged massively poorly. But again: the actual pool/snooker sim is the best I've played.And I'd like to see some greater variations and even customization in the rules supported - while there are many, there aren't quite my preferred set of Aussie Pub rules.And I only play offline. No idea what the online stuff is like, but it seemed about as professional as the interface... not very.			"

												Have high blood pressure?  Stay away from this title folks, you'll be in the hospital faster than you can say *** THIS GAME.  I've played all of the virtual pool series, and this one was a high disappointment.  Let's start with a few of the -good- points, and there are a few.1> Visually nice to watch, the textures and over all graphics are good.2> Physics are - decent.  And it pains me to say that because you can find spots where the physics are painfully obvious to be on vacation.  What would stop dead last shot, happens to roll JUST enough to **** you over next shot.That's - about it.  Now for a shortened list of the bad points, points that aren't just me gnit picking.  Yes I only have 5 hours on the game, but it is very much enough to tell you what I've learned so far.1> One of the game's selling points is ""Tracking so you can learn the mechanics of the ball.""  Which it does do.  In practice.  Only.  The minute you load up one of the tours you can kiss the tracking lines goodbye, you won't be getting them at all.2> Another point is the ghost ball aiming assistant.  Which you do get. On tours, but it's a deception.  You line up perfectly only to have your ball miss the pocket and JUST happen to line up perfectly for your opponent.  Not all of the time mind you, sometimes it doesn't do this until you're on your last shot that would win you the game.3> The second ghost ball that is on the target ball to help you line up your shot.  Again this is very deceptive and not 100% accurate - more like 75%.  Maybe I'm not quite lining it up perfectly - but I'm playing on a 50"" monitor so there's that.  It's not accurate.4> Poor controls and Deception in features.  So you spend a good 10-15 minutes going through the games tutorial.  the tutorial teaches you to use the F key to set the stroke power of your cue.  Remember the point about tracking lines?  This feature is GONE in anything other than practice, and the actually mouse controls of the cue is painful at best.  You line up your shot, you pull back on the cue, you push forward hard to break and the cue stops moving and doesn't hit the balls, in confusion you try again only for it to react way too early and your cue ball travels a pitiful inch across the table.  Bad controls = hard to play game.5> For those of you who have no idea what M. Bisoning is.  You will learn, oh yes you will learn.  You want to learn the game so you play the story on the easiest setting - which means NOTHING.   If the game decides you need more of a challenge.  The 10 year old girl who has been missing every shot suddenly becomes a crack shot and sinks everything, performing bank shots, jump shots and masse shots.  I - wish I was exagerating on this, It tries to issue a 'challenge' by having your computer opponents running with the equivilant of you using tracking lines - it's obvious if the computer decides the computer is going to win, the computer is going to win, going as far as obviouslly curving or increasing the speed of your last shot to have you scratch.From someone who's played all of the VP Series, I have to say I'm disappointed with this one, There's just no logic in what they expect you to accomplish.  It's clunky, it obviouslly ****s with your shots to emulate difficulty and the controls are lacking.  If you could look past the downfalls, it is a VP game, It can be fun in some instances,  But I wouldn't play it for the competitive side, you'll have a heart attack.			"

												I am a grandmaster in NAPA pool leagues. I am BB in BCA, and a Master in MIPPA. I know the physics of pool quite well. This game series is, and has been since Virtual Pool 1, the closest in physics to actual pool than any other pool game ever created. If you don't have a table and want to practice at home, this is absolutely the closest thing you can possibly get. The only cons are the relatively small playerbase (there are still enough people on at all times to find real player matches though, but youll run across a lot of the same people on a Monthly basis, which is a good thing and a bad thing) and that they don't seem to update the game very often to fix some minor bugs that can sometimes rarely be quite annoying.Virtual Pool 4: 8/10			"

												Firstly great customer service from Celeris. Brought the game some time before it was released on Steam through the Greenlight project and was given a steam key to activate the produce here. 10/10 for that.As for the game itself, the mechanics are great, as accurate as you can get for a pool/snooker simulation. The carrer mode is a bit lacking though and not really very engaging but that isnt why you really play is it.....Getting the right balance of computer opponent can be tricky, some are just stupid and pot the white straight into the pocket 3 times in a row (and so lose the frame) while others never miss, but on the whole it isnt bad at all.An exccellent pool/snooker simulator that you should certainly pick up if your a fan of the sport8/10!

												This game sucks, the algorithm of how the white ball moves acted as if it doesn't want you to pot in any ball successfully,  magical curl keep showing up out of nothing, and the white ball will keep moving on the table until you scratch......conclusion, this game sucks			"

												""It will really make you a better player in real life.."" My♥♥♥♥♥ This game's physics system is completely shot. Expect the cue ball to continuously bounce around like it has a mind of it's own even after you try to get that moving target of a shot power setting down. It gets to a point where it's; hit the ball, pocket the cue ball, get wrecked by the AI, hit the ball, pocket the cue ball. Seriously, the game would be enjoyable if it wasn't for the fact that the cue ball will bouce all over the place after a shot with no power. Really aggrivating experience and do not reccomend this game. Save your $25 on something else, something better.			"

												Despite numerous attempts to resolve graphical glitches with this product, Their poor customer support team  failed to come up with any constructive advice other than try 're-installing the drivers' or 'it must be a broken gfx card'. in my eyes this is very bad customer service.The game engine is very dated, it uses the same engine as its former counterpart VP3 released more than 15 (yes fifteen) years ago. very poor outdated GUI interface, and a very, very poor online profiling system which has NO PRIVACY options, so beware.have now uninstalled the product, and will expect a full refund for a lower than mediocre product.

												Pros: Feels like real pool. Is certainly the most realistic pool game out there.Cons: Mildly offensive/unPC. Poor difficulty ramping for the AI. Poor AI.			"

												I came from Virtual Pool Hall, which is a very old version of VP4. All I can say to all the pool/billiards enthusiast is that this is a great pool game, it is very well-done game. Recommended!			"

												Very bad software. Crashes 8/10 times, can't get the graphics to a reasonable quality, sometimes the screen just goes black and there is nothing I can do but pull the plug on the computer, etc.etc. I was really looking forward to this, specifically because it includes game types like carom and 3 cushion. But it turned out to be a complete waste of money. Do not buy!			"

STEAM SUCKS!  I :got: STEAM Coming out my ears I'm so mad at them, for STEALING From me, for ignoring my requests for help getting multiplayer working.  STEAM SHAME ON YOU!VIRTUAL Pool 4 looks cool and would be fun, if you could get multiplayer to open... If you have a problem, don't expect any help from STEAM!  THEY WILL JUST KEEP YOUR MONEY an not give a damn if your game opens or not.  The only thing I got was a WASTE OF MY WINTER BREAK!  I NEVER GOT TO PLAY THE GAME I was looking forward to playing because VP4 Multiplayer NEVER Opened, and THEN STEAM WOULD NOT REFUND THE MONEY?  :WOW:  CLASS ACT!  BRAVO!THUMBS DOWN ON STEAM SUPPORT!

												Undoubtedly the best billiards simulation game out there, with most realistic ball trajectories and pretty accurately simulating many subtle secondary effects. It is also a good learning tool for playing real billiards games. Thankfully, this is more of a simulation than a ""game"", i.e. there are no distractions when making the shot, no annoying sounds, etc.While VP4 does a pretty good job as a pool simulator, its main drawbacks are related to peripheral stuff - very outdated menus and GUI in general, confusing camera when the balls are moving around, meh FMV's, impossible to skip auto opponent's warmup strokes, etc.At the end of the day, still - a mighty good pool billiards simulator and enjoyable one, too, as long as you stick to making shots and don't need to fiddle too much around the menus.

												only few hours so far and my 1st impression about that game is very positive . lot of people used to compare Pool nation and VP and you know what they are not that different . there are still few differences though- graphically both games are pretty similar- on smoothness VP seems a bit more smooth than PN- on accuracity VP is clearly ahead . with VP you really think you are in front of a billiard table- where VP really makes the difference it's on games available . all major games are included . i love french billiard and not only the game is available but there 4 or 5 different french billiardsbeautiful , accurate , smooth , with plenty of different games for all tastes VP4 is a very good billiard game			"
