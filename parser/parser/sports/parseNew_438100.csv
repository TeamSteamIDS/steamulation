								This game could be good, if only:* Had a moderation team that did not target non G-rated content* Allow for age-locked rooms, to prevent children from joining and to allow adults to be adults* Allow for password-protected rooms to play with your friendsThe number of times I've seen moderators ban people for next to nothing is likely going to prevent this game from actually becoming successful. It's unfortunate because the formula they have is actually pretty good.UPDATE: Shortly after the posting of this review, I found myself IP-banned from the game. Cannot even access their website. The VRChat video of the banning also was ""banned"" from their community page. TLDR of the video: Someone else's actions resulted in a mass-banning of the entire world. This is not the way to generate a fanbase.			"

								I am having a VR setup since December and I have seen A LOT, that includes a ton of games, ""experiences"", demos. And also a bunch of social VR apps, incl. Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.This is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do. Seriously it's mind-blowingly good. "

								This chat client has great potential. For the most part, the game has been a good experience, with some very nice people who don't mind helping you with uploading avatars and making rooms, etc. There are games and different worlds to visit but this is mostly a social game.VR headsets are not required, but one of the games will need the VR headset. There's a tenpin bowling game, this is a casual game where you can just walk in and play at anytime. Another game has you bouncing a ball off walls in a small arena so that you can hit the other player to knock them out. You are also equipped with shields. This one seems the most interesting out of the bunch, but it requires a VR headset.There is also a basketball court where you can try to get the ball into the hoop, not easy. There is a baseball game but i've not seen anyone play it yet.There is a wild west type First Person Shooter and a few other similar ones, they are fun but it's better with a VR headset i would imagine. Right now the mouse controls are too sensitive to play, but you can still play.There are a few rooms that have pencils, which you can use to draw in mid air, neat.Most rooms have youtube video interaction, you can search for videos to play or just listen to the default playlist. There's a bug where it sometimes automatically changes the video back to the default ones. It would be good if you could select playlists to play while searching. As of now the music automatically plays it's own playlist set by the room creator.It's begging for a chat box, it doesn't have any kind of chat function at the moment. That is my main problem with it, since i don't really like to use a mic.It's in Early Access but is 100% free, you wont be charged for avatars, rooms, or anything else. To create a room or avatar you need Unity, it takes a while to learn, i recommend watching VRPills tutorial video. Some kind of avatar sharing would be nice to have in future, but for now there is a selection of default ones and the ones you can create with Unity.Installing is easy, the game downloads each room seperately so no lengthy download times. When the creator of a room updates the room it has to be downloaded again, but that is only a mild issue, and mainly effects those with poor download speeds.As a whole, i think this social game is pretty good, i've played games like Second Life, Google Lively, and a few others, none of them impressed me as much as this one has. There's no harm in trying it, so try it...			"

								This was a blast. It's fun visiting all of the cool places with people. The only thing I would recommend for the devs is in the smooth locomotion mode to make it ""hand based"" orientation like Onward does it as opposed to ""head based"" turning. It makes me feel a bit off when I turn my head while moving forward and my direction changes. If dev is reading check out the difference in Arizona Sunshine's new locomotion update to see what I am talking about. I would also recommend slowing the forward locomotion down 20% or so.			"

VRChat ReviewPlease note that this review will mostly be covering subjective/opinionated issues concerning the game.Positive- Helpful and often hilarious community.- Developers/Moderators interact and discuss issues with the community often.- If you're familiar with or willing to learn Unity, you can upload your own custom avatar.  You can also create/build your own world/home and upload it for the community to enjoy.- Previous patch upset the community, it was fixed/resolved within a day.- Decent role-playing community if you find the right people.- You have the ability to mute people, make them invisible, or not get close to you. - There's a decent amount of games within the VRChat world you're able to play, free of charge.Negative- Please keep in mind that the following is merely my opinion and may not be considered a negative by other people.I understand that when you're developing new technology and social environments, you tend to be looked at under a microscope by gaming journalists and/or people looking to be offended by something within your product. I feel that the developers are a little too focused on creating safe spaces and striving to not have any negative publicity within any review/journalistic source. There's two problems with this: You're never going to appease every person and the moment you cater to those who are easily offended, you'll find yourself constantly under their scrutiny with each patch, custom character, social interaction, etc. (ex. Overwatch) They've given the community the tools to handle anything they deem inappropriate/detrimental to their game-play experience. To further push the ""safe space"" narrative would only serve to appease a select minority and limit the freedom/randomness within the world and thereby push people to find a place where they can be themselves (ex. Velvet Sundown after removing TTS (text-to-speech).  But like I've said, this is only my opinion, I will continue to support VRChat because it's a great new way to meet people and really explore a whole new world. If their goal is to create a safe space, that's fine as well, I won't condemn a company because of my personal beliefs on what's not offensive and what is. It's a really great experience and I would recommend anyone to try it, you have nothing to lose, it's free.			"

								This is the best application for virtual reality, hands down. I have been a member of VRchat for over two years, and the community is what makes this place so special. Each ""room"" in VRchat is a direct upload of a scene in Unity (software used to create most VR experiences). This makes it very easy for community members to upload new rooms and content. The developers of VRchat are also making the games they have (Capture the Flag, Battle Discs, etc) available in the SDK. This means over the next few months anyone can adapt these games and create new versions of them!VRchat is a great way to gain exposure to Unity/development...but you can also just have fun and talk to others here. Other social VR apps don't even compare in that feeling of community you get when you log in. Our meetups are on Sundays, but since its public release there have been people logged in continuously. Come join our community, and see for yourself what makes this such a special place!			"

								This is a very cool blend of personalities and Avatars.  It takes a while to really appreciate how cool this is.  Three are a lot of very special and creative minds/personalities here.  Some very clever coding has gone into making this environment.  I love that you mix with the coders and employees of this system while you use it.  They take great care in making sure everything is presentable.  I find myself looking forward to going into VR Chat and often get lost in it losing hours and hours without realizing it.  The built in games they are creating are LOADS of fun... be sure to try Battle Discs.. and Capture The Flag as well as the new Goldmine..			"

YouTube™ Video: HAVING FUN IN VR CHAT! - HTC Vive Gameplay 

			Views: 2,246		

			Today I played an online multiplayer game called VR Chat. It's a really good game which lets you interact with other people in cool environments.		

VR Chat is the best social game which I've played in virtual reality. I've played it for well over an hour and already had lots of fun. The people I've met have been very welcoming and friendly. So far I've only tried two minigames (discs and wild west) and both of them were well designed, bug free and simply fun to play.I've played a few other social games (e.g. Rec Room, AltSpaceVR) but VR Chat exceeds both those games in my mind. It just seems as if there's a more established community here and overall everything just seems better (e.g. the games).			"

								Alright my home dogs, I got say this game, This game is the game of all games it's without a doubt the best game in the universe, I say this having 2k hours in tabletop and I quit that to play this. Honestly you need to get in this game as fast and possible. The Devs treat you like a actual human, I say this meeting and personaly talking and hanging with them. I send nights just chilling with devs 1 on 1 or with others, There the best I have only meet VRPILL,Mechlaid,Kirito,Gunther, Somewhat Violet. There the best I got to say I'm telling you once you play this you won't ever need to play another game. Honestly I'm not plainning on playing anymore games or buying anyothers. Endless its series I play before that are coming out with new games cause memorys. I do have to say I'm only on desktop as of now, But even if I am I'm having loads of fun talking etc. A few things to note there updating the game constintly adding new things, Avatar Creation and World Creation very tricky and complcated I don't recommend you try to make one right away if you never dealt with, Unity,Belnder,Maya,Cinmea4D cause you will be very confused. Though there are videos online that can put your mind set in the right direction taking you someone step by step. But you could always ask staff,devs etc for help even people with avatars already, But keep in mind even if they have avatars they may or may not know hwo to help you. Its still pretty difficult to make one. But what really put this game on the top is its open source anything within the games rules is allowed I say ask the devs what your planning before doing so. The hub consintly being checked on , Also this is a E for everyone game so keep in mind its for kids also. So in the hub you got watch what your saying my first day in the game someone got banned for loads of not okay words to say if you get my drift. Scripting is not allowed yet but that will be soon there working on it as I write this all in all 100/100 as of now.Do you recommend this game? 100% Yes			"

								I first found VRChat when it was released on Steam and wish I'd found it earlier. It is by far my favorite social app for VR, both because of the community (which is excellent) and because of the modding. Provided you can follow simple tutorials, you can use Unity to upload any avatar you like to VRChat (most of which just work automatically) and even create your own custom worlds which you and others can visit. If something doesn't work (with your avatar or world) they support an excellent community of modders on Slack who will help you figure out why.So basically, VRChat is a VR social space where you can be any avatar, visit any world (dev OR user created), all while interacting freely with others across the world. It really does feel like the first little baby step toward The Matrix or Oasis. Finally, the mods are helpful, fair, and actually take action against serious abusers. Don't believe the fake reviews (from people angry their favorite troll got banned) about the mods being draconian - the *only* people who get kicked or banned from VRChat are those who behave toxically toward other users and continue to do so after repeated warnings. If you like making your own avatars or worlds, if you like interacting with cool people, if you like mods who are friendly and helpful while removing repeatedly toxic users, and if you like being social in VR, this is the game for you. Try it!			"

It's got endless potential, has tons of random things to to and runs so bafflingly well I am shocked.Someone wanted us to checkout his PT hallway world. There were like 60 people shoulder to shoulder and not a second of lag, or any framerate drops. I am baffled by it. The amount of customization they are offering and will offer in the future is crazy. It's free, everyone should be trying this out.

								7/10! Would recommend!I decided to randomly check out this game the other day! I definitely had a lot of fun! VR itself is slowly but surely maturing, and as such, many of the games that utilize it are awkward, clunky, and unpolished. While this game is definitely not polished, it does a great job in comparison to any other VR experience I've had. There isn't a huge playerbase on it right now, (there were about 50 people total on while I was playing). I still managed to find two entertaining friends to explore with! I really don't have any complaints about the game. For what it is, it's actually very solid. Good on you devs... Anyways, I had a lot of fun, and will be uploading my experience on youtube. Here's part 1 in case you'd like to see some gameplay.

The mods are amazing people who not only work hard to keep the game safe but also participate and have fun with everyone! One of my favorite parts is how much control the players have! you can upload and use any avatar you want as long as you know how to bring it into unity.

								Really need the ability to select which Microphone the game uses for Input like any other VOIP software/game allows. Otherwise you're left hoping the game picks up the correct device (in my case it does not). VR Control leaves quite a lot to be desired. When I played EVE Valkyrie, it was amazingly simple and easy to adjust as you could hit a button to re-center / re-calibrate the forward-looking direction. VRChat seems to assume that the sensor is directly in front of you, with no way of re-calibrating or re-centering it, I did happen across what seemed to ""recenter"" the VR headset but when trying to walk forward, well... I personally know my left from my right, and my front from my back, but the game doesn't.In addition, I checked the options and ""Gamepad"" is checked as though it is enabled, but is greyed out as though it is disabled, and unable to use a gamepad to play as shown in the store page/options.All of that said, I would like to see the direction this game goes and would recommend it if some more basic functionality was corrected to allow users to handle things a bit better.

								After 2 hours of playing this game i gotta say that i would recommend this game!You can play VR mode  and or Desktop ModeAt first i thought this game was just VR only till i figured that it can be used in these 2 modesOther thing is you can meet new people, Plus they are friendly! (By the way, i didnt know that you can visit their creative worlds, i visted one when i first played this game and it was amazing!)However, there is most games in VR chat that require just one hand and some games that you need VR only (less they update it, witch it is still early access)This is going to be my new favorite game and i gotta admit, its addicting.Keep up the great work devs!

This number doesn't count the amount of time I've spent tweaking avatars in Unity, and I'm just a novice.It's got the same ups and downs as your average open-ended chat app. Find the right people, be a chill dude.If you're a world building ace in Unity, or a really poly-efficient modeler, you're going to have a field day.

								Best social VR app out right now. The avatars and play possibilities puts VRChat in a league of its own compared to the other entrants in the social VR space. So far the vibe is friendly and open and hosts have a range of tools to kick/ban trolls. However avatar customization is done offline so for the moment you are stuck with stock avatars unless you know how to rig, animate, blend etc. Free SDK allows uploading content and avatars for so at least the devs can build experiences for the rest of us without having to pay for SIM space! Bring on the block chain economy / super agro privacy settings --don't store my PII and the NSA can't ask you for it-- and VRChat has a solid chance at becoming a big part of the evolving metaverse.

								This felt like the Second Life of VR, and if that is a good or bad thing depends on where they take the software. When I say that, it feels like the developers made an engine that could be used across multiple applications, and VR chat at this time is a demo for other people to take the engine and create a specific application. Or in another way, it feels like the second iteration of AltVR. Now it is free, and it is interesting to try out.. so on that it gets a YES on recommend. That all said, it feels unpolished in the graphics, and the activities don't really grab me. After under an hour, I hopped back into the bright and happy world of Rec Room. That all said.. I am going to follow this, and see how it grows. Gonna say, my other impression is that it looks like somebody wanted to transcribe EverQuest into VR.			"

								I just recently started playing around with this VR experience or collection of games, or interactive application, it is hard to define really, but it is awesome.  This is now my new go to application to show off just how cool VR can be.  Not only does the communication with other uses work almost flawlessly (if both have good headsets and a microphone) but the app itself is beautifullly constructed with multiple ""Worlds"" on can visit.  Some of these worlds offer pretty fun competive multiplayer games, like capture the flag or gold with either laser pistols or six shooters (depending on the game) other experiences are in sight and sound, like multiple movie theater spots (where you can use your Youtube to play the content you desire), presentations rooms, etc.  There is so much to explore and/or create it is awesome.  Just last night I visited a moon base, not only was it beautiful and peaceful, I was surprised to see I could leave the moonbase and walk around the moon, jump in simulated low gravity and explore!   The avatars are full body and you can choose from a number of pre-created forms as well as upload your own.  I was standing next to Wolverine (with claws and everything) yesterday.    Definite a must have for any VR user.			"

								As a furry, being able to present myself using an anthro character in VR is very important to me. So far this is the only app (other than Anyland which is just too much going on to be useful) where I can create and upload an avatar that represents how I prefer to see myself. It's quite new, so the process of creating and uploading an avatar is still very complicated and buggy. Many people complain that they upload avatars and they can select them, but they never rez. There's also the thing where you have to map every individual part of your body that moves (including each individual finger) to your avatar in the Unity application before you can upload it. On another note, the things you can do in this VR space are fairly limited and static: There's never anything new, so the few demo worlds that are available are all you get, and it gets boring quickly. It's like the devs just arrived at a point where they went ""okay this is enough content, we're done."" At the moment there's no way to change the luminosity of other avatars, so you've got those people who will crank the luminosity to maximum on their models so they glare in your face like direct sunlight. You've also got people who will make gigantic room-filling avatars and stand there waving their arms around in groups of people. While this app is an excellent concept, I see the freedom people have with avatar creation being stifled quite a bit because the way it is now just isn't scalable; the potential for abusive avatars palpable. Basically imagine all the problems jerks cause inSecond Life, but now it's all around you in 3D space.			"

								A fun pioneering environment for creating shared experiences and experiencing surreal encounters with a wide range of humanity. Creative-minded folks can use the free Unity editor to import avatars and create shared virtual environments.  It's fun to run on the desktop, but you really need to try it in VR for the full immersive effect.In short, VRChat is full of friendly helpful people, thoughtful role-players, goofballs, storytellers, casual chatters, and all of them part of a supportive community working to build a shared dream.

								easily the best social vr app so far if what you want to do is design your own characters or build worlds.  the avatar interaction is super comfortable.  and i like that there's no teleporting, i find it better for group activities.  you can still kind of teleport if you're sensitive to motion sickness like some of us but your avatar moves at a normal pace, and then you catch up to it.  vrchat is quite powerful already and is only going to get more so, i encourage everyone to get familiar with unity since it's easier than it looks and you can create your own little corner of the metaverse now.

								This has to be the worst game i have seen since HF.First off the ""mods"" or whatever you call them are trigger happy little nerds who will be prone to kicking you for whatever reason. I guess thats why the dev hired themSecond they have children running around so be ready for squeakers and little kids hollaring. Looks like the dev wanted to involve children for whatever reason which is creepy  knowing that he wants a VR game affiliated with 9-year-olds. Furthermore, the whole itself is just plain dead. iI wouldn't reccommend downloaiding this if you don't wanna waste your HD space or bandwidth this game is utter rubbish.Admins timid/banned mehttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4-J24bVMAAvQNL.jpg:largeHe's a notorious pedophile.

								Bad moderators. Ban people for playing their game in ways they don't like. Feels like they're trying to cater to either an audience of SJWs or people under 10 years old. Also, the game has glitches which have been present in it for the 2 years before it came to Steam. Want to fly? No problem, just jump off a cliff and continually press whatever button you have bound to forward. Did you work hard on rigging a character to play as in the game? Too bad for you, the moderator is triggered by your avatar and will ban you from the game if you don't change it.			"

The very first night this came out on steam I was up until midnight messing around and having fun with so many people and the creators themselves who are genuine and always willing to help out anyone right away. Along with working diligently and long hours to help the entire community. I would highly recommend this game to those who are searching for some VR fun or even if you dont have a VR setup like me and just play with a keyboard and mouse or a controller definitely worth checking out at the very least and meeting the wonderfully friendly, humorous, and kind community.
