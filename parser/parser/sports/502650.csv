												Autumn Park Mini Golf is 99 cents and it's still a better game than Tower Unite			"

												Truely this game isnt a thumbs up or a thumbs down its somewhere in between, at least for the price you pay for it. Controls are pretty bad though, and it doesnt have reversed y-axis for the mouse. It runs fine, looks fine too. The balls physics are great, and giving power to the ball is clear. The most fun i believe is walking around the park freely, it something i personally saw before.So would i recommend it, yes; if you can live with the clunky controls.			"

												Not a great fan of the music, but more importantly the physics seem off.  A ball will roll down a slope apparently not picking up any speed, and will quite often hit a wall and just stop instead of rebounding in any way.  This can make it hard to play the ball for the next shot, as its  either obscured by the wall or you can't look down far enough to get your cursor on the ball.I also found the controls jittery and there is no way that I could see to adjust mouse sensitivity or fine-tune graphics.  I couldn't really tell any difference in gra[hics playing on fastest or the highest setting - maybe if I did a side by side comparison it might have been more obvious.Also the way the trees and flowers shiver and vibrate is frankly disturbing.

												For the price they ask you to pay, it is an ok game. It is a great foundation for a mini put game that if the creator continues to work on it, they could have a great game one day.Pros:-Walking around is cool-I like the visuals -Ok course designCons:- Controls are wonky EDIT 2: controls are better! almost perfect!-""Pause Menu"" is just terrible. None of the elements make any sense togetherEDIT: Pause menu is no longer terrible. Just a bit weird.    - Note to developer: the sound sliders are a neat idea but dont really work.			"

												Great atmosphere! Very relaxing experience. The movement is a little wonky (there's a slight delay between hitting WASD and the character actually moving, and I found sometimes I would jump onto a green only to slide back off it), but it doesn't really get in the way of the fun.It's only one course (hence the price), but if you're looking for simple chill-out fun, this will suit you nicely.
