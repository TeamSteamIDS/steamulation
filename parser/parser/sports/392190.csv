												I purchased this game and enjoyed it. The controls were fantastic the haptic feedback on your racket hand when you swing is what makes this game awesome.Pros:Great control schemeHitting the tennis ball people is a lot of fun Cons:Not a lot of content. I played this game for about half an hour and really felt like I experienced all there is to experience. I cant see myself playing this anymore then I have.No AI you hit the ball then teleport across the court and hit it back to yourself No way to freely move. I had to hit the ball near where I wanted to teleport to get there, a means of teleporting to a specific location would improve this game a lot. PriceTLDR:Overall this game is fun put it is definitely not worth the $20 I have requested a refund but I would gladly repurchase this game and change this review if the price is lowered and when an AI is added to play against similar to WII Tennis.

												Way too expensive for the amount of content. It's fun, but way overpriced. Sure, VR is a small market that has to pay off the development cost, but that doesn't justify what they currently offer. Wait until it's 5€ and you'll get a fun game to play at your Vive parties and laugh about your friends.It is not Early Access, however the developer promised new content. I will update this review if there's more content.Addendum June 14, 2016: Performance seems to deteriorate with each patch up to the point that it is becoming unplayable for me since hits do not register. This game used to run smooth at some point for me!			"

												This game was 25% off (~$15), so I decided it may be worth it. I was wrong. I played it for five minutes and ran out of things to do. Additionally, the one thing that it does, it doesn't do well. If you swing too fast, the racquet passes through the ball. You cannot put any type of spin on the ball, and it just doesn't seem like the ball is going in the direction that it should. Overall, it's cute, and I would probably pick it up for about $2.99. However, it definitely isn't worth the current price, or even the sale price for that matter.			"

												This game is quite cute, and I really enjoyed the environment. That said, I can't thumbs-up a game I got bored of after two minutes. There's no real ""game"" here, just a mediocre tennis mechanic and a cute environment.EDIT: If you want VR tennis, the newly released HoloBall is your best bet. A quarter the price, and much more fun.			"

												It is very difficult to describe this game in English words...Why you ask?You're a selfie taking unicorn on a floating tennis court in the middle of the sky, with randomly appearing creatures with tennis balls for heads, and clouds for sportswear. When you kill them, they turn into hearts. Kill those hearts, and they turn into more hearts. You can then kill those new hearts to earn some unlockables. Meanwhile, while all this is going on, you play tennis...by yourself!I know that's a lot to take in, but below you will find my more in depth review:#SelfieTennis starts you off on a decently sized tennis court. There are many ""Ballpeople"" all around the court in various different locations such as; on the bell tower, on the edge of the net, on top of the walls, and on the sides of the court. By Incapacitating the Ballpeople, you can earn hearts. This is done by either; one, physically hitting them if they are in the range of your play-area. Two, throwing your racket at them, or three, swinging the ball in their direction.In order for the hearts to spawn, the Ballpeople must actually fall off of the cliff. Once this is done, a heart will float up in its place, and you can collect it by using the same methods I previously mentioned for killing the Ballpeople (Minus #2). After collecting the heart, the heart will spawn smaller versions of itself. Collecting these occasionally give you items like; New rackets, new balls, and a variety of power-ups. There is a ton of content for all three of these categories, and it is a ton of fun to try to collect all of them. You can activate these items by using your touchpad. Left touchpad lets you select the ball, and right lets you select your racket. Also keep in mind that when you restart the game, all of the items you unlocked will no longer be available for you to use.All of this stuff, and I haven't even mentioned the core aspect of this game: Tennis!The way the gameplay works is pretty self-explanatory. You activate the racket by holding down the right trigger, and the ball by holding down the left. After serving the ball, you are automatically teleported to the other side of the court in the general area of where the ball is going to land. You then begin hitting the ball back and forth to yourself, hence the name ""SelfieTennis"". The goal of this game is to see how many times you can hit the ball back and forth before you miss it or before you hit the ball out of bounds. Going for your personal best is very addicting. The physics of the game are very accurate, although there are times when the tennis ball seems to go through your racket. The difficulty of this game is that of real tennis. Someone who is an actual tennis player vs someone who has never played before, has a much greater advantage at this game. #SelfieTennis also includes 44 total Steam achievements that you can try to unlock. Its very fun and addictive to go through and try to unlock them all. Some of the achievements also include a small joke in their title and/or description. Not only does this game live up to its name with the fact that you play tennis with yourself, but it also lives up to its name because you can actually take selfies! By pressing the grip button in-game, you activate a selfie stick that you can use to take a picture of yourself in front of whatever you want at any given moment. This photo can then be uploaded to your Twitter account straight from the game, or saved to your computer. Your avatar in the game is a unicorn. Your color can be changed by hitting yourself with the racket. All in all, I highly recommend picking up this VR title. It's got great immersion, is a lot of fun, has a high replay value, gives a great amount of exercise, and is very entertaining in it's own goofy way. SelfieTennis takes full advantage of room-scale and motion controllers, and is tracked next to perfectly!			"

												I am really enjoying my time with #SelfieTennis so far. It's really hard to describe it, but it's basically a sandbox tennis game. You are playing tennis, with yourself. You serve the ball, and your view teleports to the receiving end for you to hit the ball again.And you can take selfies. It's silly, and there's not currently much to it other than playing tennis (in VR) and attacking mascots with balls. But it's also very satisfying.			"

												SelfieTennis has been a lot of fun and I really enjoy firing up every once in a while. It's not a game I spend a lot of time with but the time I do spend with it is a lot of fun.The only thing I'd be rather cautious with is your play area: I did push my controller into a wall at least 2 or 3 teams and actually hurt myself. So, if you want to play it safe, you might want to make sure you have a little ""safe space"" around your play area before playing with yourself ;-)			"

												#SelfieTennis is a brilliant game. At our office we have sunk more hours (25+ over 3 accounts) collectively into playing with balls than in any other Vive game. Everyone can develop their own play styles, and we have a running tally of different records going: Over net (117), Under net (57), throwing the raquet (5). So much fun, and we keep going back into it day after day, for quick breaks while lighting is being rebaked, during lunch, after work, and so on.			"

												This is a pretty neat demo game to show your friends for about fifteen minutes. During that fifteen minutes you won't be able to figure anything out because there are no instructions, no in game menus, no nothing. You want some help with it, guess what.....you're on your own.Originally posted by developer:I have a rule against menus in VR. And since I'm the boss I get to decide.After you try this game you will be so glad that other games don't follow this same pattern. Games that are actually worth the $19.99 price. If you can pick this up for a few bucks then get it for sure, otherwise skip it. "

												Graphics are pretty good. In fact i wish they'd spent less time on side stuff and focus on getting the physics and gameplay a bit more accurate. You get points no matter how the ball comes across the net. It can hit the ground before crossing the net and then double bounce, and it still counts. This game is for people who live in high ceiling places. I don't, which is why I have a deep scratch in my ceiling (lucky I didn't damage the controller). So I don't know, if you want a proper tennis game, you'll just have to wait for someone to make it. This ain't it.			"

												This is a great game. The core gamemode is playing tennis against yourself and it's a great way to kill some time when you're bored, but my favorite part of the game is all the hidden powerups that wildly change your gameplay. You can knock spectators off the edge and then collect their hearts for random powerups that range from things like new tennis rackets to lightsabers and a unicorn on a stick that you can ride around the court by bouncing up and down in roomscale.I have owned this game for awhile now and the developers put a lot of work into it with frequent updates, new content, and tweaks to the physics of the core game mode. It's always fun to check out the updates and see what crazy new things they have added.I put out a gameplay video and review on YouTube:

												This is fun, but it needs a few refinements. For those of us who play non-VR tennis, there are some problems: any kind of racquet-head speed results in missing the ball, so you have to swing very slowly. Adjusting the grip (even to an Eastern grip) causes the ball to fly into the bottom of the net. The length of the racquet is wrong on the backhand side, so you miss way more than you should. You can't slice, or put any kind of spin on the ball. If you try to put topspin on the ball, you just hit a lob that goes 10 meters up.I could continue, but those are some of the issues I have.			"

												I was a little hesitant to get this game given claims about ""lack of depth"". I have to say that I was actually pretty blown away with how responsive everything felt.It is also closest to a workout that I've had so far on the vive and I was really having fun.And this the thing about the vive, simple becomes amazing again.Word of caution, really really clear your space. I found that the difference between this and other games is there is a real force required in order to hit the ball.I would also advise to use the straps for this one.Lastly, when serving the ball be careful not to smash the controllers into each other.

												This is a great game for VR. Very simple, there's a court floating in the clounds, freakish tennis-ball headed things standing around (which I probably spent the first 15 minutes of the game knocking out with serves to the head and whacking them clear off the level with the racket), and that's about it. Easy to learn, hard to master. The point of the game really is to get the longest rally with yourself that you can.  I usually play it for 10-15 mins everytime I log on to VR just to get warmed up and used to the virtual world. If you can't enjoy a game just for the inherent fun of it then you might not like it. There's no other levels, no bosses, it's just tennis, with yourself.			"

												I, like many Vive owners I expect, have become more wary of $10 - $20 VR titles that are little more than tech demos.  I always assess the level of negative reviews and what they are saying, to try to determine if this is the case.  I was therefore very wary about this game and its recent reviews, but took the plunge with the sale price hoping all the glowing reviews would justify the purchase.  I am really pleased to say that this game is exceptionally fun!  That is the key to this.  Yes, it is just a tennis tech demo really, but unlike all the others, the actual mechanic is very enjoyable, satisfying and doesnt get old within 2 minutes.  Considering the recent news of new content by the developer, this game can only improve with time.  For now, it really is in the top 3 things I have done with the vive in terms of enjoyable and satisfying mechanics.  Not worth $20, but definitely worth $10.  Its all the fun of hitting tennis balls without having to go and get them, or run around, or have friends to play with.  Go play with yourself now!			"

If this was a $5 game, it'd be amazing, but I can't recommended it for $20USD, hell I'd struggle to recommend it for $10. Purely because there isn't much to it, if feels good but gets old quick. :(Also a lack of menu's or any kind of instruction is very poor, no one should have to fiddle about to work things out or rely on reading the steam description and/or forums in 2017. I believe I read that the dev has a anti-menu policy in their VR games, why? Why make your games a pain in the neck? Menu's can be done very well and quite creatively in VR.			"

Why do the stupid guys fall into the court and then just roll around forever? Boring and stale after 2 minutes of playtime.

												Hitting the ball is almost as satisfying as it is in real life. More than makes up for the lack of content IMO.			"

												Cute, but shallow. Almost no gameplay of note, and what little is there is flawed. Why does it put me in a position where it is virtually impossible to return the ball every 5 hits? Why do the stupid guys fall into the court and then just roll around forever? Boring and stale after 2 minutes of playtime. No thanks.To make matters worse, the devs think making snide comments on your review will somehow entice you to come back and change your review. Or, perhaps, they just can't handle any criticism of their awful game.			"

												Good, simple fun. Easy to get lost in. My hands started getting a bit tired having to hold down the triggers the entire time, wish they'd give the option to use the grip to hold. On that note, I also got annoyed by the selfie stick appearing every time I accidentally gripped the controller from throwing a ball too hard. So a couple of minor input changes could be good to have, but still good fun!			"

												Despite being a little shallow, it's pretty fun and relaxing to get a good volley going.  I would recommend it because it's fun, but at the current price ($20) it is a little steep for the depth it offers.  Either added gameplay or lowered price would move it from the ""maybe buy"" to ""should buy"" category.			"

												Relaxing game for VR.  Back & forth high-score of 72. Hitting the rotating discs will spawn more tennis-heads.			"

												It's a nice mini-game, but at €19.90 you expect more. The biggest problem is the lag, and I'm running an AMD FX-9590 at 4,7Ghz coupled with a GTX980ti. The gameplay is pretty nice though.			"

												Did you like Wii Tennis? No? Well you're going to like this. If you are a social Vive user i'd recommend this game, its good for a laugh with mates.			"

												Tennis Court in your house. Watch for lamps hanging from the ceiling in the play area. If you won't remove them - you'll smash them sooner or later. "

												I still like to give this one to VR first timers. Very easy to get in and pretty nice for what it is.Is it worth 20 €... nope. Wait for a sale or get it cheap from somewhere else.			"

												Review updated: The physics are much better now, repurchased. Had my girlfriend try it and she had a blast. It's a pretty short experience but fun. Should be priced closer to $5-$10			"
