								Got my refund pending, this game is dead. There should be a way to play against NPCs but it relies too heavily on the community multi-player. Basically they took a niche audience (Kaiji lovers) and tried to make them a game that requires a much larger audience. I love Kaiji to death, but this game won't work like this. I'd rather play a table-top version with real cards.Zawa~ Zawa~::review made while listening to the song Espoir::			"

ざわ…ざわ…ざ‥ざわ……ざわ...[But seriously this review is going to be based on and earlier version of R-RPS which I had the pleasure of playing earlier this year] So what's it all about? Restricted Rock Paper Scissors is a strategy gambling game based on the on the game of the same name found in the Anime ""Kaiji""; Where the player is given a finite supply of cards representing the different moves: Rock, Paper and Scissors.The Player is also given stars, as a form of currency: What these stars for the player I won't spoil, but they're important.It's a simple concept to understand: However where these mechanics end, the meta gameplay begins.(And it's great.) This is getting TL;DR, just gimme the reviewAt the moment, it's barebones: Gameplay mechanics are in place and work as they should, but that's about it.The art design is wonderful: from the unique, colourful and seed generated characters to the cool 80's vibe the setting art gives.Music: To be addedSound: To be added			"

								A very fun game only let down by the lack of players.I haven't watched the anime that the game is based on, which may have helped with the learning curve, but once you get passed that it's a nice and surprisingly deep game full of backroom deals, mind-games and tactics between players. The ‘rock paper scissors’ mechanic merely provides context to all the stuff happening around it and shouldn’t be confused as being the main part of the game.Unfortunately, because the game is so heavily based around player interaction, a single-player version of the game as it stands wouldn’t really be possible. This means that (currently) your only real options for playing are creating your own match with friends (who can use the free demo version to connect to your match) or waiting for the weekly organised matches. Hopefully in the future this will be less of a problem and finding matches will be easier. If that happens it could really be something great. As an early access game I have not experienced any bugs and it seems fairly feature rich, just need more players and a nicer UI in some places. "

												(New review for the newest update)Alright so this game is truly legendary. At first glance you may pass it up, but after playing it for a bit, you might find yourself genuinely enjoying it. I'm a huge fan of the Kaiji anime, and Restricted RPS is an idea taken from the anime. If you're a huge fan of the anime this is definitely the game for you.The game may seem very simple at first, but a lot of strategy goes into a good match of Rippus. Since you can take in-game notes, you can keep track of who has what easier. The UI isn't too complicated which makes the game easy to pick up.Now that there's a narrator in the new update, the game is even better. The VA did a great job with creating tension.So definitely check out this game.			"
