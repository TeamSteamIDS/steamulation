												This is my first review on a game and I had to say something to let people know. This game is not worth the asking price. It is basic and not a good work out, you only use one hand for every sport. The baseball bat never hits the ball properly. This game is. I would like to give good feedback because I like the idea but it is just too expensive and no one will be happy they spent the money on it. The girl just stand next to you and say the same thing over and over. I wont be playing this game again, it's just bad. I will see if any updates come and fix it.. bring the price down a lot or make it free.			"
