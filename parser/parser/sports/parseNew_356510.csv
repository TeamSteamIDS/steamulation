								I don't know if they are still working on this game but I would not recommend this game in Early Access.The idea is nice but at the moment the game is nearly unplayable and you should better wait for more updates on this game.Could be a nice Arcadesoccergame but I think there is still a very long way to go.

								I played a round and thought this game had very interesting concepts and design. Two teams of players wearing futuristic suits face off in a soccer match with no rules, where fighting and fouls are allowed. I would strongly recommend a controller to play this game, and I feel this game has amazing potential and hope to see how it develops and grows.			"

								I really enjoyed my time playing soccer rage, is a sort of hybrid soccer game with combat system, in which you can play soccer as you know or simply kick your rival *****. The game is still on early access, so it has limited content, I hope the developer will continue working on this.Pros:- Is really funny, most if you play with friends.- Graphics and music are ok, animations are neat and effect display correctly with low end cards- Has potential.- Very kind developer.Cons:- There is still a very long way to go, the game needs more content.- The ai need improve.- Awkward controls.

								I like the concept of this game, hopefully it can be developed for farther greatness, it has potential.Now, I found it that, when using a controller, it is not very responsive. On another note, the goalkeeper. I dont know if there is any control over the goalkeeper as most of the time he makes a save and does not grab the ball. I am talking about some one made a rage shot and the keeper saves it but cant hold on to it so it trows it to the side, then proceeds to *grab* it but does not. An opponent can literally hit the ball of his hands into a goal. That is frustrating.The game also needs better control when swithing from one player to another. It didnt seem as responsive.I will definately wait for this game to be developed, and for multiplayer of course!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a fighting/soccer hybrid with robots. It's clearly early access as most of the content is locked. Here's my objective opinion for whatever it's worth: The potential is high in this one. The gameplay is relatively simplistic but very addictive. You can have 5 v 5, 7 v 7, and 11 v 11 soccer matches. The desired goal is the same as soccer, however the twist is your robots will go into ""Rage"" and you can start a fight, potentially disabling apponent's players. The combat is actually a fun little diversion, and is well done considering the game is not a pure fighting game. There are combos and the controls aren't too stiff in combat. You have 4 different attack buttons, can jump, duck, and attack with fair fluidity. It's a timed battle. If you completely disable an apponent, they'll ""break"" and will be disabled for the soccer portion of the game. If no ones health fully expires in combat before time is up, the fight is over and you continue. The soccer portion of the game is done pretty well. The passing and ""shooting"" is accurate, you can pick up speed with a run button, and if you kick the ball hard enough you can damage the goalie over time. You have slides and trips and can switch players on the fly. The controls are a little complex considering how simple the gameplay is, but once you get used to it, the gameplay is very addictive. Additionally, the ""sci-fi"" art style is a lot of fun.There are some definite improvements that need to be made, though. As I mentioned at the top, most of the customization and features are locked out, though there are place-holders for the content, giving you a good idea as to the future goals of the developers. Switching to the soccer player closest to the ball can be a bit buggy and fighting combat against the AI on normal can be frustrating. Sometimes they'll lock you into a juggle until almost all of your health is gone. Despite a run button, the game feels a little ""slow"" as well, but the benefit to this is that you really have to pass a few times to push the ball up the field, meaning you can't just take off with the ball, run ahead of all of the AI and take your shot. You have to be more strategic. All in all, it's a fun game, which would be made more fun with some friends to play with. The potential for the kind of fun you'd get out of a game like Rocket League is here, though the game isn't nearly as polished as Rocket League in it's current state. If the developers really want to take the time to develope Soccer Rage into a great ""under the radar"" gem, the foundation is there. Beyond that, you just don't see many games like this. It's refreshing to see a developer attempt to make something so bold.			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, being completely honest, this game is fantasic. Just with the features it currently has its a very fun and addicting experience. Its so satisfying to kick the ball into the goal with a ""Rage Kick"", a powerful kick that consumes your rage bar. Even if the ball is blocked by the goalie in this situation, it deals a large portion of damage to him. Its also very satisfying to consume your rage bar to initiate a fight with an enemy player right before they kick a goal. bringing me to one of the main features of the game, the fighting. The fighting mechanics are simplistic but still fun, satisfying, and can lead to some clutch moments where you dont know whether you or your opponent will lose a player. This is especially tense when both you and your opponent are one player away from being forced to forfeit.The soccer mechanics in the game are also tight and responsive. not many complaints there.My only ""complaint"" with the game is that there isnt alot of content yet. but the devs have a giant list of upcoming features, including: Online, more tutorials, more teams, statistical differences between each team, and the ability to create a team. there probably much more stuff coming im unaware of. I definetly reccomend this game. Its already great and is going to get even better later on down the line. Pick it up now if you want to get the game for cheaper than the final release.			"

								Soccer rage is a funny mix of a soccer game and a mortal combat (although the combat is far far worse). This game has a kinda looney fun idea and now it just needs more development. Currently there are way too many bugs. Like when you pass to someone the player switches before the pass is recieved, so if  you are running a different direction when you pass you will switch and cause the player to miss the ball. This and the fighting controls suck. They need to be improved a ton. Currently not a game worth $10.			"

								The concept of the game is very good. I enjoy fighting while playing a soccer game(that's why I like hockey I guess). For an early access game it still has a lot of development to go, even before going online, there are some graphic tweaks and some gameplay changes that could make it better.The good: - Visuals are great, some polygons are very obvious but for an arcade it's very nice.- Stadiums look great, perhaps adding some traps or some gameplay specific things for every map would be amazing.- The music is very good, a bit repetive sometimes but it's very nice. The music when getting into the fight could be ab it more hype.- Tutorial is very nice in order to start the approach to the game, it is just somehow when playing the game and trying to apply things learned in the tutorial it's a bit tough, I found it a bit desperating when trying to make a pass or trying to move my character in the field. The Areas of Opportunity/Possible Improvements:- I noticed some graphics issues when playing the game, considering I have a GTX 970, it was weird to have some graphic lag on the game. I was recording a gameplay with the Windows 10 Game DVR, this might be the thing that contributes to the game slowing down(I noticed this also in GTA V), will comment further on this.- The fighting can get boring, when the main ""catch"" of the game is the fighting and you avoid fighting because it's tedious and boring, it seems that there is a lot of room for improvement on that side.- I played with an XBOX One controller and it seems that I had some input lag, I tried to make some changes, restarting the game and that input lag was a bit confusing.- Menus need a lot of improvement, before getting into a game I tried to check the game ""options"", I didn't change anything on them but I pressed the B button and it returned me to the ""stadium"" select screen, this happened with a loading screen as all the menus appear to have it.I personally recommend the game if you like soccer and like fighting. It has a lot of things to improve, tho it's still in early access, I hope the developers read the reviews and ask for more testers before releasing patches(I read in the credits there was only one tester, perhaps more points of view could improve the game).Overall, to be an early access game, it's a good fun game, still doesn't have online but I would love to see how a game it's played online. I will add a video review later this week and will update the post.			"

Early Access Review
								So what happens when Fifa and Tekken go out on a date and have sex at the end of the night? 9 months later they have a babay called Soccer Rage!! haha.Like most people have said in previous reviews this game has a lot of potential to be a decent game. Just some aspects need changing and improving.For example the game is really fast,  It's chaotic. It doesn't really allow for you to pass the ball, dribble past opponents or perform long passes. Throw in the AI who are really fast and catch up to you instantly and  it becomes rather difficult. So I would like to see the gameplay slowed down so you can actually play the soccer side of the game.The fighting for me is decent but does need improving. I find that once the AI start attacking you and get you in a combo attack you can't get out of it and die. Maybe I am just bad at fighting games but I have only won 2 fights and got destroyed in every other one (because they combo hit you and you can't break it). I'm not sure if you can block because there is no move set at the moment so that makes it even harder.Shooting could be slightly improved as I find that I can't aim my shots in to the corners. They always seem to go straight towards the goalkeeper.As it is early access there is only one game mode at the moment i think (quick match) but there are other game modes to come so that is good. Also at the moment there is no training mode either but will be implemented at a later date.What I do like is how you can literally destroy oppponents by just sliding in to them, shoulder smashing them and all round beating the living hell out of them ha. It feels satisfying when they break through about to shoot and you slide in behind and break them in half ha!You either win the game by scoring most goals overall or by destroying opponents, rendering them useless and taking them down to 6 players  (I think it is 6 players) and then you have to foreit. Many times I've been 3-0 up but lost because they have owned me in all the fights and lost my players to death haha.So as it stands at the moment it is quite basic with just the one game mode and simple (yet chaotic gameplay) and a very hard fighting mechanic in my opinion. I do believe that it could be a really good game if they just slowed the gameplay down, improved the fighting and improved the shooting.  I'm sure they will update the game throughout the next few weeks so maybe hang on til they do that and improve the game before you purchase. Either way I had fun playing the game and look forward to future updates.Here is some gameplay of the game just showing you how it plays

								The idea of this game is really great, and this is why I bought it.Unfortunately at the moment the game is unplayable for me. It is horribly slow and full of lag in the response of the commands, even for single player and with lowest graphics settings possible. My PC can run GTA V, Skyrim, Dark Souls II, etc with very good graphics and very easily, so I am sure that this issue is not related to lack of my PC's processing power.Even then, I recommend this game because I see a lot of potential in it, and I know that the devs will solve this issue for the final version.Edit: I just played a game where I was losing by 6-4 but I ended up winning the match after having killed 5 guys of the other team. This alone made the purchase worth it ! Now I only need to wait for the devs to optimize the performance of the game and then have a lot of fun with it !			"

Early Access Review
								TL:DR Game mixes Blitz: The league and Mortal Kombat.Soccer rage is a game that i found while browsing ""Just good PC games"" steam group, after clicking on it I was shown an interesting concept. You take the ""no holds barred"" aspect from Blitz: The League and mix with with equal parts FiFa 20XX and Mortal Kombat to make a smooth mixture when you can play dirty and really hurt your opponents.Sold by this concept I bought the game and proceeded to download it, and that is unfortunately where the trouble began. Before I go further, I do want to point out that I am an American and really do not know the first thing about soccer...While soccer really doesn't have a lack of violence, and violent overreactions. I would say (as an American) that it does lack a certain... Whats the word... Hyper violence that football possesses. Soccer Rage takes care of that in spades!You are able to select one of eight teams (currently, more on the way). This does include Germany, England, Brazil, #murica, and Spain. So you can recreate grudge matches with the system (there is actually an achievement for that...). The avatars for the teams are interesting, possessing a semi-robotic/heavily armored chic with both home and away jerseys able to be selected. They are also unique enough in color choices that it is easy to see who is who while in the middle of a match.The arena selection is slightly small, but they are really only just eye candy. The only difference besides visuals would be the music attached to them. As well as the occasional particle effect in the background.Gameplay starts out with your team taking the field in 5, 7 or 11 man teams. Once kickoff starts (or whatever it is in soccer) it plays like normal fifa. Where you maneuver your men to steal a ball from the opponent and kick it into a goal. What makes this game different is the addition of 2 bars, a health and a rage bar. The health bar is fairly explanatory, the more you get hit, the less bar you have. Once you hit 0 health you explode. Let me restate this, THIS IS A SOCCER GAME WITH EXPLOSIONS. The second bar is the rage bar, this is gained through gameplay, stealing and getting stolen from, shooting a goal and so on. You can burn some of the rage bar to fuel extra special attacks. Whether it is a bugger of a kick, an exceptionally difficult pass, a brutal tackle, or an invitation to scrap. When you do successfully start a scrap, the entire team surrounds the two, cheering and hooting much like a high school fight. There the gameplay changes drastically. The two fighters then have a limited time to lay as much smack down on the opponent as they can. This is a very VERY good way to drop an opponents health or to take him out of the match entirely.To wrap this up, its a very enjoyable game to play! Admittedly it started out a little rough for win10 users, however the devs are nice people and worked very hard to set things right. Now i look forward to having some friends over and having a good couch multiplayer session with this game. Just to see what happens...			"

								Very interesting approach on soccer, It is strange to me that no other developer has done something like this, because you actually get like two games in one here. I want to see more teams and online multiplayer and some polishing on animations. Also a fighting tutorials is missing so when I fight I dont really know what to do. But appart from that, it is fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Soccer Rage sounds like a fun game, a mixture between a fighting game and FIFA soccer that I played with.While the game is in beta, I wanted to do a beta preview, not the actual review of the game in whole since it is not complete.  As it is Early Access, the game does have a great amount of potential.  Here are the following pros and cons:Pros-Soccer!  What more could you ask for?-National teams for countries to play with-Fighting implemented like in NHL where you must duke it out between both players.-Unique animations in the fighting styles-Unique uniforms for both Local and Away teamsCons-Early Access-Barebones as it is-Clipping of certain scenes are found-Jerky, unreliable response using gamepad controls.Special notes for Game Developer:Using the button to exit out of Replay and Kickoff results in both Replay and Kickoff text to appear at the same time.When I enter into fight mode, the AI continues to fight me even if I am not prepared.  While executing my controls before the screen shows two players fighting, my player keeps on fighting without me knowing about it.  There's no proper executing of the fight scene before it begins.  Holding the AI and player from fighting until the words announced, ""Fight!"" ends should help.The AI opposing team is too fast, and are capable of playing the ball against a newcomer to this game.  Slowing them down, or potentially beefing up the player 1's AI along with the goalie would help.  The goalie would not defend the post after a few rounds.  After my goalie entered into a Rage fight with someone and won, he refused to defend the post.  He would stand there and then receive hit after hit with the ball.  So amazing he can survive such encounters!Whenever I switch to a new player on my team, I noticed that the previous player I selected stops.  It just stands there for a few seconds before rushing to move into its position.  If I select the one player repeatedly, the player can't move for a second or more.  It results in a loss of the ball, loss of movement, and unable to defend aggressively.These are mostly some of the reasons why I lost my first Quickmatch as Germany against Japan!  0-8...  *shudders*...  Not ever doing that again.  :P  They're a World Cup winner in 2014!  Not World Cup losers, haha.			"

								The concept of the game its so good, but have some problems.I know its beta or alpha*The bad*-but its no optimize for ATI cards (too much lag).-the system of change of character to close of the ball its just...weird (for dont say terrible).-at time of the fights i feel too slow than cpu.-time of loadings its ridiculous.-some problems with gol-replay (with bottons).-i dont understand why its a game you need minimum 4gb of ram :/ (maybe for the lights that move the game but ultimately you dont enjoyed for the speed of the game).-the music it's not bad, but the sound between menus it just loud.maybe i dont have de best pc for this game, but the requirements are bad for the graphics of the game (well i think so)The good-the gameplay its fast and funny.-the fights make the game feels diferent.-mecanics like ""video-shot"" its good (maybe variety make it still better).-fields somewhat cliche but good.-artwork and models 3d are ok-sticky musicmaybe i will play this game again when have more update.

								A fast paced game of cyborg soccer.The cyborgs take damage as they play and it shows. No helmet, body parts on the field and a life bar. If one drops to 0 health you lose that player for the rest of the game. All that is even more apparent when in the fight mode. Your cyborg starts the fight with their health at whatever amount of damage they have taken up to that point and might already be missing parts. There are combos and super moves to use. If the time doesn't run out then one of you is going to end up a pile of parts on the field for the rest of the match.The soccer itself plays so that there are only a few breaks in the action. No out of bounds or fouls. All you need to worry about is goals and kills.Smooth gameplay.

								Sometimes you kick a ball around. You kick, kick, then kick the ball some more. And it becomes a bit of a slog. Wouldn't it be nice to break the monotony of kicking a ball by say, kicking balls?In Soccer Rage you win a match by either scoring more goals than your opponent, or by kicking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of their team until they have less than seven players left. It's a sports game AND a fighting game!It looks, and to some extent plays like a mix between FIFA and Mortal Kombat, though I should say it doesn't have the depth of either of those games. It's also still a work in progress with some bugs, small annoyances and features yet to be implemented. But even as it is, the game's fun, cheap and it definitely tries something new. Worth picking up to mess around with if you want something to play in short, quick bursts.			"

								I'm not a person who enjoys sports for obvious reasons I'm in steam, but I had my brief encounters with traditional soccer games and simply do not understand them, because they have the rules of traditional soccer.This little gem is about putting the ball in the opposing goal REGARDLESS OF HOW !! So do not require any knowledge of traditional soccer games at all.My first games were failures by attempting to play like he knew something about soccer games ... is not my approach but you can win by fighting, it makes it much more fun and entertaining.It has means to improve but the basics are correct. It supports joystick which makes it a little more classic because you can play in your living room.Not even close to have the best graphics and not even close to being full ... but it has much potential. And it seems like the Dev team is Working hard on it.Entertaining. Very entertaining, one of those games that you do not know why you bought it but end up trapping you for hours every time you play it.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~No soy una persona que disfrute los deportes por obvias razones estoy en steam, pero he tenido mis breves encuentros con los juegos de soccer tradicionales y simplemente no los entiendo, porque tienen las reglas del soccer tradicional.Este joyita se trata sobre meter el balon en la porteria contraria SIN IMPORTAR COMO!! Por lo tanto no requieres conocimiento alguno sobre los juegos de soccer tradicionales en lo absoluto.Mis primeras partidas fueron fracasos porque intente jugar como si supiera algo de juegos de soccer... No es mi acercamiento... pero puedes ganar por medio de peleas, que lo hace mucho mas divertido y entretenido.Tiene medios para mejorar pero los fundamentos son los correctos. Tiene soporte para joystick lo que lo hace un poco mas clasico porque puedes jugar en la sala de tu casa.No tiene los mejores graficos y no esta ni cerca de estar completo... Pero tiene MUCHO potencial. Y el Equipo de Desarrollo parece estar trabajando arduamente en eso.Entretenido. Muy entretenido, one de esos juegos que no sabes porque lo compraste pero terminan atrapandote durante horas por cada vez que lo juegas.			"

								Bueno, no he jugado mucho al juego pero se lo que tengo que saber, y pues que puedo decir tiene sus puntos malos como que no puedes cambiar de jugador a tu antojo y solo se cambia mas rapido si esta activada la opcion de seleccion automatica, me gustaria que le agreguen seleccion de personajes manual. Tambien lo que no me agrado es que la camara se centre en el balon y ya que se centra en el balon no me deja ver donde esta el personaje con el que estoy jugando y eso lo hace realmente incomodo tendria que estar la camara enfocando todo y no solo el balon, otra cosa es que me iba a 10 fps no se si era por mi pc (aunque puede que lo sea ya que mi pc no es muy buena) o mala optimizacion. otra cosa es que probe el juego en facil y normal y en ambas dificultades hay momentos en donde los contrincantes no saben lo que hacen espero que arreglen eso. el menu es algo confuso al cambiar la resolucion. En fin dejando todo eso de lado el juego es disfrutable y entretenido, y cuando se forman pleitos es realmente hilarante, tambien que puedas luchar eso lo hace diferente a los demas y me agrada, los personajes tienen un buen diseño y me agrada que para cada pais haya un diseño distinto, eso es todo lo que tengo que decir sobre este juego.Mi puntuacion final es 7/10, pero cuando mejoren el juego probablemente le ponga una mejor puntuacion.

Early Access Review
								I'd avoid this one.The premise really enticed me. A football (soccer) game with fights akin to that of Tekken/Street Fighter. On paper it sounds pretty ridiculous, but potentially like a lot of fun. First off, the menu screen had a cheap but endearing polish to it. It seemed like all of the representative teams (based on countries) along with everything else set out on the menu, was voiced by the same guy. I didn't mind that because this is an independent product.When I got stuck into the gameplay, my opinion swayed very quickly, and that endearment turned into unadulterated rage (no pun intended). Every function within the context of the game feels delayed. For example, shots and passes feel like they take a good second before they're activated. That amount of latency makes the game almost unplayable. The fighting sections, which proceed a bad tackle or 'red card' scenario, are much the same. Janky, delayed controls which don't respond quickly enough, along with poor animations and pre-ps2 era graphics make this game absolutely unplayable. I really can't recommend this. I took a chance on Soccer Rage despite it's early access status, and it really didn't deliver on any of its promises in any way whatsoever. The naive child inside me is saying ""Maybe it'll get better. Give it time. What if it's just having a rough start? Who knows, it could be as successful as Rocket League one day!"".All hope is dead. Just stick to Rocket League everyone.			"

								Football game made by developers with no knowledge of football. Looks like a free mobile game as well and lags on a PC. People interested in playing soccer games with special super abilities to hurt your opponents are better off playing Captain Tsubasa on emuator or Kopanito All Stars or watching Shaolin Soccer or even play arkanoid because this is just like arkanoid . Utter garbage this one.			"

								The concept is really cool, being able to do what you usually can  not in a sports game is awesome, the concept of fighting feels a bit clunky and it lacks deeper mechanics.All my experience was with the keyboard and mouse, so while the controls are not that hard to learn it feels like this game is really broken when trying to even move the ball around, it happend to me twice that i scored an own goal, and the IA did that too.Overall fix the control, make it more responsive and easy to move around, it feel like a chore. In my last two matches i was just pressing right and  left mouse again and again, and i won those matches easily. If you want this game to be a succes you need to fix those controls, focus on tighter controls. The presentation and overall visuals are a bit dull, kind of unimpressive, it feels like it lacks a strong personality. At the end,  there is nothing to see here at the moment, i feel like the programmers know they need to add so much more but they decided for some reason to put this on an open beta.At this current state i do not recommend this game, maybe i will change my mind in the future.It has a lot of potential, just imagine all the crowd that a game like this would have, all the people that love soccer games plus all the people that love violence, being able to win either by goals or by fighting is an oustanding idea, good luck.

								edit: people why are you giving not helpful? your probably people who like the game lol i stated my opinion at the time and it willl stand until certain things occur, if i ever grow to like the game than at that point ill change the review to positive, its early access so upon it being completed and out of early access i will play and redo my review based on that experiencei havent played this too much of this game as i havent had time, but i played a bit and had no idea what i was doing, the first time you play you should have it explained a little bit, and i like fighting games in fact that is the only thing about this game but i couldnt figure out how to get in a fight, i advise making that clear as well, i love fighting games and since the fighting is a key point to this games success i advise you ramp it up a bit, make it more intense and remind people of mortal combat or street fighter.... i also experienced lag and with the graphics as they are i should not be getting lag from this game... so is it worth buying for 10.99? no... as it it is not worth it, i got this game for free and for free i would recommend it but i cant with it costing as much as gmod or goat simulator but lacking the quality of them... i think this game in its current state could be bought for... say... 2.99-4.99, this game has a lot of potential though so ill be looking forward to its future... you guys should offer steam cards too, its a little something that is nice to have			"

								this game is terrible. you can't switch between players properly, your players just keep running forward when you pass the ball to them, there's no form of tutorial what so ever, fights are random as peepee and poopoo in your pantiehoes and i can't get a refund because gaben thinks it's okay to not give refunds for early acces games (though i think that's bs as i am still just buying a product from a store and i should be able to get a refund if i dislike my product, regardless of who made it and under what circumstances etc.). So this game better get A LOT bettter soon or i will come and take gaben his fukki sukki thai girls away, fak u gabn!			"

								If you read the ""About this game"" section of the store page you would be forgiven for thinking that the features listed have actually been implemented and are playable as advertised. You would also be very very wrong. The ""about this game"" section is their To-Do list. The devs clearly have no links with EA Sports because the features advertised are most defninitely not ""In the game"". 8 playable teams (not 32) 2 kits per team (Not up to 3), one playable mode in the form of Quick Match (No tournament mode or any other mode for that matter) and a completely non-existent customisation system. It isn't locked or greyed out like the other options, it just isn't there at all. The football feels clunky and stiff and the A.I of the players is laughable. The fighting sections are even stiffer and although hilarious due to animations seemingly stolen from a far superior fighting game (which shall remain un-named), but executed in a way that makes every fight feel like you're controlling Zangief covered in weights and the amusement rapidly decreases with each disjointed scuffle as you realise you've paid them actual money for this. Avoid.			"

								Well, I'll start off by saying I did not buy this game. It was given to me by a friend who was harassed by the ""lead"" developer who wanted him to re-review the game to see if it was better. The game has not improved and is a good concept but needs a lot of work before it can be playable, let alone worth the $15 sell price. The controls have a great deal of input lag and oftentimes don't register at all if you play a controller. The ""friendly"" AI have ZERO situational awareness and will usually ignore the ball completely and assume the player will take care of it. Then there's the fighting. The fighting is very imprecise. It's simply too easy for you or the AI to spam one button. It's not terrible, but could use some work. This is the same for the majority of elements in the game. No rules is also an interesting concept, but there needs to be a few rules. The slide-tackling gets incredibly frustrating and the game just simply becomes, ""Push the B button and win."" In short, I cannot recommend this game until some improvements are made. I definitely would try and get it on sale, perhaps for 90% off. Otherwise, I would just wait until the game is vastly improved. Oh, and back to the dev harassment, the YouTube video can be found here:

								NEW REVIEW!!!SOOO today i recieved a friend request from who claims to be the lead developer of this game. Zbrusher (which if you will notice has a review complimenting himself on his work). We talk for a while about my review. Then it happened. He started to offer me game keys to re review his game. Saying he will do what ever he has to so that i will review his game again. Saying that he needs my positive review. So i play it for a while and notice nothing is diffrent at all. And that is because this game has not been regulary updated. While i was playing AI froze in both of my games in the same position and it was still just utter mayhem which i am usually not opposed to, but this is just bad. You have no control on what goes on as it is just everybody slide tackling. After i finish playing, the Dev (Zbrusher) contacts me again telling me to review it positively. To be exact ""Just place it as possitive so we can be in good terms..."" then messages me later saying ""Let me know when you get the review, on possitive so I can let my collegues know :) .. thx bro"" This is not the first time i have been harrased. for the past month since my earlier review (below) i have gotten many friend request and each time i ask them to leave me alone but they would not. So after beign bribed and harrased THE GAME IS STILL NOT GOOD like i said before i WANT to like this game, but i can not. But my main complaint has now change. It is the Dev that i feel is the biggest problem trying to bribe me into a good review and i feel this is going ot become a problem. I want to seet this game succedd, but not like this. Here is a link for PROOF of his messages

OLD REVIEW!!!As much as i want to like this game i can not. i understand it is early access but over all this game is awful. most of the time you aren't controlling what is going on, and when you are the AI will catch up with you instantly and if not slide tackle they will go into a fight. The fights are awful as well, you have no idea how to do anything as there is no control scheme for it and the AI can begin a combo before the fight even starts. I would not recommend this game at the currnet state but if later in development it impoves on these things and makes it feel like you are more in control i will reconsider.			"

								So Soccer Rage is a new early access title that combines soccer and a fighting game in one. Conceptually it sounds pretty great. However, after playing a few matches it just seems to fall short for me.

			First Look of Soccer Rage Available on Steam - http://store.steampowered.com/app/356510/ Website - http://www.EarlyAccessMedia.com Podcast - http://www.EarlyAccessPodcast.com Follow on Twitter -...		

In a futuristic setting where soccer has become bloodsport you find Soccer Rage. Both sides start with 11 players plus a goalie and must either win the match or beat the opposing team into submission. Each player has a health bar and takes damage when then are tackled, shouldered, or through a minigame expressed through a Street Fighter styled fighting game.On its face this seems great. The ability to not take any penalties and play a NFL Blitz styled soccer game is great. I love the idea. It just doesn't execute either side of the game particularly well.You are dropped into the game and the only option is to play a quick match. I'm okay with this considering it's in early access. You then have to read controls because otherwise you won't know what to do. The controls for the soccer portion of the game are pretty straight forward. Pass, shoot, long pass, and through ball are all accounted for. There are also more involved controls like jumping, curving shots and the rage mechanic. I, however, could not figure out how to get any of the controls that used the Left Bumper or L1 buttons plus another button to work properly. I didn't feel like I could hold onto the ball long enough to actually execute any of these skills. Actually, I couldn't figure out what I was doing at all really. Everything felt sluggish to me. Passing seemed poor, switching characters was inaccurate, and shooting the ball was near impossible. The whole soccer portion seemed incomplete and just not fun to play.Every once in awhile you'd get into a fight which dropped you into a 2D fighting game where you have no idea what buttons do what. I have to assume there's a light/heavy punch/kick but not sure which was which. There are also a few special moves which I button mashed my way to figuring out. However, much like the soccer portion, the fighting portion is slow, confusing and nonresponsive.This game has so much promise though, the concept is there. A heavy action oriented sports game seems awesome on the surface. The futuristic gladiator style gameplay is nice. Though neither side of the coin is executed particularly well. The soccer side is no Fifa and the fighting side is no Street Fighter. So you're left with a game that's hard to control, with mediocre graphics and a great concept. It's unfortunate.I think if the developer went in a more arcade route like the aforementioned NFL Blitz and went with a 5v5 game with simplified controls the game would be much better IMO. I'd love to play a 5v5 version online with all real players. I'll wait and see what happens with Soccer Rage but for now I'd have to pass. I'm hoping to see this game find it's happy medium between sports sim and fighting game.For more Indie Games, Movie and Music reviews check out EarlyAccessMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast.

Early Access Review
								I bought this game hoping for an upgraded virtual futuristic fighting kinda soccer game like I remember living so well on the PS1 with a relatively unknown game called ""Dead Ball Zone"".Well, after I played this game just a few moments, I quickly realized that this game is not nearly as good as that old Dead Ball Zone on the PS1 that launched in 1998, some 17 years ago.  This game has horrid graphics, move super slow, is awkward to control, and honestly just 'bites'.  I know it's early access, but but it is far too raw, buggy, and awkward to even make me want to play the game for more then a few minutes.  I was happy that Steam had just introduced their new Refund policy shortly after I bought and launched this game.  Maybe if this game continues to get such positive reviews, gets more development time, and gets much more complete.. then maybe I'll give it a another try in the future.  Or maybe I'll just spend $5 on eBay and buy a copy of a much better game like this and buy Dead Ball Zone instead.  It really surprises me that there really isn't a very well made and polished game of this style out today.  I think some development team out there should really consider making a good game like this but with fast, fluid controls and good graphics.  I mean there's not really many games like this today, and I know it's so tempting to make zombie shooter #32,678,531 but... {shrugs}  LoL.-  Zaxx			"

								This game had serious potential. A cross between an old school fighter and an old school soccer game. Updates need to be made to fix the fps drops, and some of the load screens need to be sped up, other than that, this is one of the only soccer games I have had fun with. Looking forward to updates...which will never come, it seems. Seems like buyers were ripped off, as there hasn't been any sort of update in almost a year...do not buy this game right now, until we see another patch.			"
