												Technically, the game looks like a PS2 game, with a 4:3 aspect ratio and no options whatsoever.Maybe the intention is good but... no. The game is not fun. People don't play a game which isn't fun.			"

												The game itself is not bad. But there's no options for controls or graphics whatsoever.			"

												I cannot reccomend this game. The controls are shoddy, the fights are short and pointless and I find the entire game to be an insult to Capoeira. I would understand if the game was in PreAlpha, but it has been around for about 2 years before coming to Steam so the windo for improving it has been open for a long time. The only reason I can see for this pile of rubbish being released is to coincide with the world cup being held in Brazil. double thumbs down from a very disappointed fan of Capoeira			"

												First off I actually like the game and enjoy playing, the fighting itself is a bit different from most games like this as in it is more strategy than button mashing. You have no health rather it is it like a tug o' war and you need to balance not getting tired.The reason for the the thumbs down is the lack of any graphic options even basic resolution. There is also no key remapping or controller support.			"

												Waste of 10 Euro's I had. The game lags, there are already zero to no options, and then the music options reverse now and then, blowing my ears out.Next to that, I was doing career and boom, after three matches my character just stood there.... doing nothing, while the other person was trying to hit me... which did not happen.  After a few minutes I quit playing story mode, and then I noticed that when I do the tutorial, you learn instead of 5 techniques, 3 techniques at the basic technique tutorial... and then it suddenly stops and I get back in the main menu with the settings again on full, once again blowing my ears out. Just... bad for my 10 euro's.			"

												The game is somewhat good but it is not worth your money.First of all the resolution is low and there are some glitches in the game.If you get tired in a match sometimes you are unable to move and are unable to take damage for some reason.			"

												The graphics were fine, and some of the character models were great even (Cossack, anyone?). The problem I have with this game is the controls or to be precise, the delay with buttons pressed. They tried to make the attacks look more natural like the fighting style, but thanks to the attack animations  being mostly unique for each character, some characters have really cheap and exploitive button combos. I would recommend it if you want to watch the CPU fight each other for 5 minutes. If wanting to play the game yourself, it shall be too annoying to like it for long.			"

												I'm shocked. I thought this game was going to be crappy shovelware, but it's actually pretty good. It's accurate to the practice of capoiera, the controls are fairly responsive (They're a little stiff, but I think they were trying to simulate the rhythm of the berimbau, meaning you can't just hammer away at buttons.) The only thing that's really goofy is the cast of characters: I mean seriously, you have a Jamaican character nicknamed AMAZON and some John Cena looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Only one Brazilian dude's even in this game7/10			"

												This game sucks but I enjoyed it.  Heads up there is no controler support and the key bindings r ""W A S D"" to move and the action buttons r ""H J B N and SPACE""  It takes a little getting used to.  I would only recommend getting this game when it's on sale and if u like martial arts or capoeira cause the reality is there isn't much appeal to the game.			"

												While the game is clearly looking to cash in on the whole world cup it is an interesting concept for a fighting game or as some have put it think Eddie from Tekken: The GameIt does however lack resolution options at the time of the review but hopefully that will be patched inVideo Review Below:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271142485 "

												So broken that I can't even play it. Won't let me select game modes in the menus, regardless of mouse/keyboard/controller. The one time I did manage to actually start a match the game was so terrible that we simply closed out right away. Avoid at all costs.			"

												It's an average game which could really be better, with an update from the devs to make it in HD resolution and rework the character models which are not-that-great but if you're into Capoeira or want to play a fighting game exclusively devoted to Capoeira, this is your currently best choice.
