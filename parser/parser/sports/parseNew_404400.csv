												I didn't think splitscreen stealth was possible, But in BADBLOOD it just plain works. You can screen cheat, sometimes you are encouraged to, but be warned: That might be exactly what your opponent wants you to do. It's a very nuanced game that seems simple on the surface but hides a ton of strategy up it's sleeves. Polished versus gameplay with an incredible art style and good music. If you like local versus multiplayer and want a spin on the classic 1v1 ""deathmatch"" get BADBLOOD.			"

												BADBLOOD is super tense and super fun and super satisfying. I didn't think there was a good way to handle stealth in local multiplayer, but this hits a perfect dynamic of trying to plot out how you're going to kill your friends and scrambling desperately to be the first one to read the situation once the two of you find each other.

												Despite the minor control issues, Bad Blood is an insanely intense game of hide and seek. The entire style and attitude of the game is unique and absolutely beautiful, with a wide array of colors and angular designs all around. The gameplay is easy to learn, but hard to master, making it a great game to take turns at with a group of friends or even to just have someone over to play. This is one of those rare times when I feel that online capabilities wouldn’t really help this game much, and may actually hurt it. Half of the fun comes from sitting right next to the person you’re playing with, so I’m glad it’s all local.Check out my video review for more info:

												BADBLOOD is a tense and exciting two player assasination game with gorgeous imagery and brutal gameplay.Game mechanics are well designed and polished--with a simplicity born out of mature game design--just enough complexity to keep it interesting, but simple enough that anyone can pick it up and play. Quick game rounds support repeated sessions of the ""just one more time"" competition found in games like Gang Beasts, Samurai Gunn, and Towerfall. While comparisons could be made to Screencheat, with its screencheating mechanic, there is no doubt that BADBLOOD has its own unique twist on couch multiplayer. Fans of Glass Knuckle Game's Thief Town should definitely pick this game up.Extra Points: The developer has already released patches to fix bugs, and has been very responsive to discussion and bug fix requests within the player community.NOTE: My review is based on the final build of the game. I spend a few more hours playing the demo the week before release.			"

												8/10 This game is awesome guys I loved hide and seek as a kid and this game is the most fun version of a the childhood game. The characters in the game are well designed although they don't have a story each character has there own unique personality. In the game there are 2 modes the first you fight on even ground both players are capable of killing each other. The second one must hide and the other seeks each player is granted 30 seconds to kill the other before swapping positions of hunter and prey.Positives++Fun Gameplay+Unique characters+Amazing art+Soundtrack is greatNegatives--no online :(-story mode?-Solo mode?https://bikakuwolf.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/badblood-short/ "

												Alright, while my playtime is not high with this title, but I feel it is enough for me to offer constructive comments and advice for my Steam friends/the community (besides, games like these need to capture attention fairly quickly when you have a local crowd, or its on to the next one). BADBLOOD has an interesting concept going for it, but falls short in terms of content and energy. Local co-op games command a certain amount of 'crowd energy', which is where this title sort of fails. While there is no tutorial on 'how you are supposed to play it', so we just went with it and tried different characters and figured it out. It plays out with more stealth than action, which is fine, but is a different dynamic for local versus with a crowd present.Pros:+Super awesome artwork+Super good music tracks+Decent, fresh ideaCons:-While controller support is great, keyboard support is non-existant (in the sense that controller 'labels' are the only option)-Only two game modes -Could really benefit from a tutorial that teaches you how some basic strategy plays out (most members of our group were turned off by having to try to figure it out - although we did)-Anti-climactic gameplay - I want high-energy like TowerFall brings, when it comes to local versus-No single player (although this is clear from the store page, but I mean how hard would it be to have a mode to practice?), and no online multiplayer if you don't know already from the store pageLooks and sounds great, but our group quickly moved on. I expect alot from an indie title for eight bucks with no single player and no online multi.			"

												Played a bit yesterday and really enjoyed the interacting mechanics and visual aesthetic. Hits almost all the marks of a great local multiplayer game including a depth of systsem to explore, short replayable game loop and intense close-call moments. The one thing this game lacks (and I fear that's the reason it won't be hugely successful) is a way to introduce new players to the game quickly. It took my partner and I close to 30 minutes of playing soft-matches, just trying out the different mechanics and asking each other how things work before we felt prepared to play a serious match. I enjoy the art and design ideas expressed in the game a lot, but I'm hesitant to show of this game to friends at parties (where I most often play local multiplayer games) because introducing all the mechanics is a frustrating, time-consuming process.

												Pretty fun, but I can't seem to find a way to play it with friends over steam. I'm sure it's one of those games meant to play with a friend in the same room, though.In either case when I did play it, it felt like a really beautifully drawn, excellent sound-designed game of chess.Though the art design on The Kid is kind of bad, I dunno.Either way, the game is good if you have someone in your house to play it with, because obviously you can't play it with someone over the net.

												BADBLOOD draws you in with beautiful visuals and a novel concept. It keeps you there with strategic depth that's surprising in relation to its simplicity. The better you know the player on the other side of the screen the more tense and exciting the game.BADBLODO won the IndieCade Audience Choice award for a reason. Check it out!			"

												BADBLOOD is broken for quite a number of players. In many cases the game won't launch but registers as running. In the Dev's defence they have sent these people direct download links.However, in my case, the game was frozen in my update queu, would not update, and required me to close Steam via the task manager every time I wanted to quit. This has only been resolved through deleting the appmanifest and a bunch of the files. The Application cannot be removed as it is ""running"". I can't find the process anywhere if this is actually the case.This massive problem has been around for some time and has still not been resolved. Given that this is not an early access game, and is a full release, this is unnacceptable.I will, of course, remove this review in the event that this bug is resolved. However failing that I feel that the dev has had plenty of time to resolve this issue that effects people who are not even playing the game.			"
