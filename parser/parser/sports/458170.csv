Early Access Review
What is SpiritSphere?SpiritSphere is the result of combining air hockey with inspiration from fantasy classics like the Legend of Zelda and Windjammers. The game is easy to pick up and to learn yet difficult to master. As a result of the setting and the ease of play it is accessible to players of all ages. The game has been designed around its local multiplayer components but the game does feature multiple single-player components.Childhood Memories EvokedWhat I am most thankful for is the ability that the game gave me to relive childhood memories. These memories were of playing video games and air hockey with friends, partners and even my mother. These bonding experiences have helped shape who I am today. Therefore, I quickly became enamored with the game. I have played many of the games that the levels have been based around. It’s difficult not to have these memories continually rekindled. I believe that many players who were raised on 1980’s and 90’s video gaming will quickly appreciate these same levels. Consequently, I feel safe in advising that the presentation is on point to deliver the atmosphere and the setting players would expect.Retro SimplicityThere’s something that works with the simplicity of retro-inspired gameplay. The ease of picking up the game and learning within moments how to play. Then comes the time playing to master it. The fact that you can then turn to a friend or family member and have them enjoy the same experience or kick their ♥♥♥ until they too learn. This is an addictive experience. That is until your friend, or in my case my girlfriend, is able to learn the game so quickly that she pulls out a victory against you (sshh, don’t tell her but I let her win!).In all seriousness, the gameplay is very basic. After all, it is air hockey. This is a good thing. Thankfully there is some variety in gameplay thanks to the different balls that you can unlock and the numerous environments. I am unsure as to how many different balls there are available to you but you unlock them by spending coins at the Sphere Fountain. There are three characters that you begin with. I believe that the only differences are cosmetic in nature. I am hopeful that more will become available as you progress through the game or in future updates.The gameplay is also very fast and furious. This is why there is no online multiplayer. If there is any type of lag, however miniscule, the game would become unplayable. While this is a bit of a disappointment as I would love to play with friends on the other side of the world.Single-player ModeDespite being designed as a local multiplayer/co-op game I argue that Eendhorn Games are selling the single-player component short. I acknowledge most players will likely find more entertainment value in the multiplayer but I personally enjoyed the single-player equally as much. Firstly, the AI is surprisingly tactile and has been well designed. Secondly, there is some depth to it. The rounds are quick and fast capitalizing on the strengths of the game and players are rewarded with coins. These coins can be spent at the Sphere Fountain. The drops from the fountain are random meaning there will be times where you get a ‘double’ from your coins. Fortunately, the time investment isn’t significant. This is about one successful round. I had amassed over four hundred by the time that I lost for the first time.Is it Steamified?Fortuitously, SpiritSphere comes jam packed full of everything that Steam players are looking for. It comes with a set of trading cards. There are also achievements. As of my first play there is only one achievement available (rookie – win your first match) but I imagine more will be available. Unfortunately, the game is local multiplayer and co-op only so no online components are available as the gameplay is too fast. Therefore, this game is fully Steamified.VerdictThe truth is that I found a lot of joy in SpiritSphere. The simplicity of an air hockey game meeting fantasy battlegrounds inspired by the classics is a great combination. I can envisage a situation where one of the major studios releases a similar game based around their franchises and blows this game out of the water. However, for a one man development studio, this is an addictive gameplay experience that is suitable for both single player experiences as well as the core multiplayer. If you have friends to play with then this title is bound to give you hours of competitive entertainment. Just be mindful of the value of your relationship.For similar reviews and our popular giveaways (including hardware) please consider visiting Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

			Join us while we jump into SpiritSphere, the new NES styled twist on an table hockey. SpiritSphere is currently in an Early Access Alpha state but its got a great start.		

An Enjoyable Retro-Styled Spin On Arcade Classics Like “Ping Pong” & “Shufflepuck”. Challenge A Friend In Local Co-Op Or Play A Championship Against Computer AI. The Game Is Currently In An Early Access Alpha State With Great Potential & A Fair Price Point.  -Pros--Nostalgic SNES styled gameplay and art style influenced by 8-bit classics-Fantastic retro chiptune music really helps accompany the unique gameplay-Easy to learn, suitable for all ages and experience levels-Multiple spheres to unlock that add variety to matches, along with item drops -Interactive maps, beta branch has additional content. More to come hopefully-Each character has a different play style, while still being balanced-Cons--No planned online multiplayer and only 2 player local co-op currently-Single player is a little short, as content is added this will most likely change-Unable to combine KBM with a controller when playing locally  Overall, “SpiritSphere” Is A Satisfying Local Co-Op Experience I Look Forward To Seeing Progress As It Develops Through Early Access. Personally A Workshop Would Be An Amazing Addition For This Game. Can’t Wait To See What Nostalgic Characters & Game Modes Are Planned For The Future!  "

Early Access Review
								The Gameboy-Zelda graphics attracted me to this game, but it's actually really fun too!The game is basically air-hockey with much deeper mechanics - stages transform, you can collect and use power up items, and each player has different moves for hitting the ball.It's in Early Access, so there's not a lot of content yet, but what's there works well and it looks like a lot more stuff is coming soon, so I'm looking forward to it. There's already a lot of variety in the different playable characters, balls, and stages - they all change the style of gameplay a lot, and things can get pretty frantic.Overall this is a fun game to play with a friend on the couch, and I hope over time it becomes something amazing.(looking forward to the upcoming 4-player mode!)

												Reinvents a genre that was made by itself.  Highly compeitive game with unlockables to keep you sucked into the game.  Very few games can be as good as this one.  On my list of favorite games of all time this game will sureley hold its place in the top 5.  Probobly the only game that can claim such a high liking from me that is also cheap.  Like 7 dollars.... who doesn't have that :P			"

												Edit:I've tried this game out recently with several controllers playing local coop.It was a blast. This game, much like towerfall, shouldn't be played solo. If you have controllers and a few friends to play with this is a great couch co-op game. If you were looking for something to play solo / online, this is not that. Easy enough rules / button configurations that my wife (who does not like video games) could play with me; and even she had a good time.Original review:I really wanted to like this game. The art style is cool, and it looked like a lot of fun.It's not fun, unfortunately. Its really frustrating, and what you see is what you get. There's not a lot of fun alternate modes, or secrets or strategies. Just play pong with a zelda/final fantasy skin.I just can't recommend this.			"

								It is a small but fun game.It has nice Legend of Zelda (SNES) stile pixel graphics and good animations.Playing multiplayer is best with 2 controllers.If you like playing local multiplayer games try this! It is quite different to other games and easy to learn (movement+3 buttons simple rules) but quite hard to master. (Timing trickshots, tricking opponent etc.)There are not that many different levels (or characters) yet, but the difference in playing with the characters and agaisnt them are quite big!The same is true for the stages, since they can change the way you play drastically!

								Full Review here = ^-^ = : http://pewpewcat.com/spiritsphere-indie-game-reivew/Do you ever think about the good old days? Like back when high tech gaming was on the Atari or an old school Nintendo? Well then you might enjoy the indie game, SpiritSphere.In Spirit Sphere, you are able to choose from a range of characters that you can unlock, the further you go in this game. The theme of the game however, is to score the Spirit Sphere in the other person’s goal. The easiest way to explain this game is a mix between Pong, but with the Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening’s art style. You have to shoot the Spirit Sphere past the opposing character into their goal to score a point. The first one to three wins.However, instead of moving sideways, like in Pong, you’re able to move all around in your area and even have special powers.  You’re able to attack the Spirit Sphere, charge at it and use different objects to help you score on the other player.Admittedly, the art style brought me back to the old days when I played Link’s Awakening on my green, Game Boy Color. It’s kind of strange playing it on a large computer monitor. I really liked playing Buster the wolf/ dog character. The magician Ozo is cute as well.For someone who enjoys competitive non violent games, this would be a good game for them. Plus, it would be a fun game for kids to play as well, seeing as though it’s non violent and can help with hand and eye coordination.			"

												Full Disclosure: This review is based on a review copy sent by request of the reviewer.Ok, here’s the deal. Spirit Sphere is FUN. It makes a damn good party game. You start with three basic characters. Lin, who moves pretty quick and has a good reach with her sword. Buster, who is fast on his paws and can return a shot quickly. Ozo, a wizard who moves slower than most but has really good reach and powerful returns. You can unlock more but I’ve not gotten that far. Yet.You also start with three arenas and two spirit spheres. Each arena is dynamic and plays differently. While the forest arena allows for a lot of item drops and forgiving goals and the dungeon arena forces you to open your defenses to lower your enemy’s defenses while balancing helpful NPCs with item drop opportunities. Killing a hostile NPC might give your opponent a power item. Killing a friendly NPC might net you nothing. There’s also the spring arena which resembles a faerie fountain park without the fountain. It challenges you to use the angled walls to your advantage. The starting spheres come in two flavors. Normal and SLOW. The normal sphere is quick and responsive but the slow sphere move slower. You can use the slow sphere to help train with as it is slightly more forgiving. Unlocks are chance driven. If you want better odds you’ll need to play a lot, much like unlocking in arcade fighters.Spirit sphere allows for 4 player local multiplayer. Plug in 4 Xbox controllers and play. It really was that simple. It makes goos use of the unity engine. It has a retro aesthetic and is paired with very pretty effects that the developer has gone to the effort of matching to the graphical style. The soundtrack is jumpy and energetic. It really adds to the ‘party game’ feel.Each character has various color swaps you can use in these situations. Everyone can play as Lin if they choose to. As your team winds down you may lose a couple of players. If you want to change it up for 2 player competition there is a Squash play mode. In this mode one player is always on the offense while the other defends. This role alternates. The attacking player bounces a sphere off the south wall and the defender has to return it. If you touch a sphere at the wrong time you’ll give a point to your opponent. Visually the game is a real treat to fans of mid 80s consoles and 90s handhelds. While it keeps the retro look there’s more to the visuals than you might notice at first. Sneakily tucked into the retro goodness are graphical effects that wouldn’t see the light of day until after the millennium.Audio quality is top notch. Gas1312's soundtrack really drives the action and keeps the party jumping. The high energy of the music does an amazing job of keeping you engaged.Gameplay wise: There’s not much to say. It’s just good fun. Watching two defenders try to return a sphere only to trip over one another and score a goal for you is pure bliss. The ease of getting into the game makes even young and newbie gamers viable competition.We tossed 4 players at this game. Two had played it before and the other two were completely unintiated. We had a blast. The game scored highly with all our participants. 3 of whom did not get the benefit of a review copy.I would genuinly love to see a horizontal set of arenas with Capture the Sphere and Team Deathmatch play modes. I don't think there's anything like that in the plans tho.Oh yeah have a video review:

The players are find and pretty distinct except maybe buster but he just wasn't a good fit for my play style. The aesthetics of the game are inspired by Old School Legend Of Zelda where the mechanics are inspired by games like Air hockey and Windjammers.

								Bought this game ´cause I like that pixel graphics, simple, but catchy gameplay and oldschool handheld theme. I discovered that SpiritSphere brings much more... Except things I´ve already mentioned, it has cool funny music which perfectly fits to whole concept of the game, singleplayer is also fine for a while until you unlock all spheres and understand differences between characters and maps, but ... the best is multiplayer. It´s so incredibly fun. Yeah, I have to warn it´s probably not a game for impatient persons. But otherwise it will gives you tons of funny moments. Playing it with my younger brother (honestly he´s not very patient) and we got hella fun. Brother is getting mad constantly (in a good way) but we´ve never played funnier game. I cannot eager to play it with my GF or friends. xD You will be angry, frustrated, mad, crazy about that but you want definitely stick to game and play it more. Beating your friends is so rewarding. You know that feelings like: ""Ok, one more game. It´s my turn. Now I´m gonna beat your *** off."" xD  Yeah, you´ll probably keep saying that right after every game. At least I do. This game is a hidden miracle (in a meaning that it´s not well known yet which is sad, because SpiritSphere deserves much more attention and I hope it will get it in a future). Excellent couch party game. Simply, top notch. Cannot wait for more promised content (stages, characters, squash mode, etc.). I totally approve Warwick J´s review and recommend you to read it if you are interested and thinking about SpiritSphere. Thanks a lot to developer for a hard work, great idea and even better execution. I love it. BTW, still don´t know how to unlock Kao (hidden character). Maybe a little advice? :) Keep up a good work.			"

SpiritSphere was featured on my Youtube channel. and now onto a small review.graphics, sound & artstyle- The graphics are a 16bit style which is a staple in the indie gaming scene, and was excecuted nicely. There are 6 characters to choose from all very distinct from the other in both aesthetic and mechanics. The 8bit soundtrack really brought the game together and was not blaring like most games who use the music do.gameplay:- Gameplay of SpiritSphere can be simply put as Zelda Airhockey. 2-4 local player game or single player modes are available. You take retro looking characters and each to tend to their own goal as a Sphere makes their way to them. You can strike and dash to send the ball over to the other player and try to score. It ones of those, ""simple to learn, hard to master"" as each character is very distinct from each other. Whats the price?- The retail price for this is $7.99USDHow many hours estimated?- With a system that gives you coins, and the player being able to constantly unlock new spheres, levels and characters (only some come unlocked), a Single player campaign and Squash Mode (a handball type esque game mode) and obviously it's main attraction the local multiplayer, this game can easily generate 30-40 hours before getting wearing tired of it.Pros/Cons- Pros: 'Its fast paced, and slow when it needs to be.'retro graphics done nicely'party game at heart, but overall a great singleplayer experience too'depth with characters'unlockable system'SQUASH MODE'quick matches-Cons'its charm wears off at times when you remember how slow these games use to play'no online modeBuy it, Wait for it to go on sale, Don't.-Well it's no secret I personally love these type of arcade games, most of my reviews have been predominately this genre. But out of all the games, SpiritSphere really stands out. When something is done so simple it doesnt need flashy gimmicks and this is what it reminds me of. A game that is exactly what you see is what you get. I've been having so much fun making this review/video. I even started going back to play just cause. So my verdict? BUY IT NOW. As of making this review/video the game sits at 40% off. But even at it's full retail price, SpiritSphere is well worth the money. "

Early Access Review
								I have a certain appreciation for the 1972 game Pong, both in terms of its simple-yet-addicting competitive play and the impact it had on the emerging console game market. Many games have since tried to expand upon or refine that classic game's template, introducing new aesthetics and entire styles of play along the way.SpiritSphere appears to represent developer Eendhoorn Games' attempt at such a reinvention, melding 8-bit fantasy iconography with gameplay reminiscent of air hockey to create a wholly unique experience. While commendable in their intent, the end result is a game compromised by poor design choices and generally skimping on depth in favour of style.SpiritSphere is undeniably beautiful in its visual design and admirable for its efforts, but it's hard to recommend something as mechanically frustrating as this. Weighing itself down with unnecessary sphere and character attributes, while skimping on worthwhile content, this is a game that direly needs to be reworked and built upon if the developer truly wants to deliver a quality experience.Pros+Stunning Map Design+Suitably Retro-Looking Character Models+Fun SoundtrackCons-Limited Content-Poor Character Balance-Gameplay Undermined By Random Variables-Seemingly Useless Points SystemThe full preview can be read here: http://www.keengamer.com/article/13805_spiritsphere-early-access-preview "

								I'm a huge Zelda fan, growing up with ""Ocarina of Time"" and ""A Link to the Past"". It's no secret that SpiritSphere takes a lot of inspiration from these games, and I loved the nostalgia.SpiritSphere reminds one a bit of the Aghanim and Ganondorf battles in the various Zelda games. Except this time you're hitting magic spheres against your friends. SpiritSphere's gameplay is, however, very unique and stands strongly by itself. It's reactive, fast-paced, and a lot of fun. The different modes and powerups make every match different.The single-player is simple and short, but fun.I'm looking forward to the additional modes and features that are going to be added as the game approaches full release.

Early Access Review
IntroductionSpiritSphere was developed and published by Eendhoorn Games. The game at this current early access stage seems to have a lot of potential, it is very fun to play but there are a few improvements that I would like to bring up to make the gameplay more enjoyable and better overall.GameplayThe game itself is very fun to play, and although it seems rather repetitive from the video and screen shots provided it really is a blast to play. Even at it's early access stage I still really enjoyed my time playing this game for a couple of minutes everyday. So what actually is SpiritSphere?The gameplay itself is basically hitting a Sphere back and fourth from your side to your opponents side, now although from that it may sound boring and not unique there are other elements that make it different. For example, there are different types of Spheres that may be faster, disappear for a short time, split and so on to keep the game fresh and have more content altogether. I really like the different Spheres in the game, they really do make each match different in some aspect.As well as the different Spheres that are in the game there are also a few characters that you can play as that have their own moves to hit the Sphere back. At the moment, there are currently only 4 characters that you can play, a girl with a sword, a mage with magic, a cat with bite and a Druid with his pets. Now each of these characters have the basic attacks, a basic attack, a charged attack that lets you briefly take control of the ball and a quick move. Now even though the characters and attacks are great, there is no way of changing the controls on the keyboard meaning that if you simply don't like the controls then you can't do anything about it. This is a bit more awkward when you are playing local multiplayer as the controls will make your hands cross over and makes it difficult sometimes to control your character.Each map that is currently available have been different from one another and will make you play in a different style, for example the forest map will have power ups that will help you that you will find by cutting the grass. While on the dungeon map the left and right side are blocked and to open it you have to press the button on your side to unlock it. It really makes for different styles of gameplay. Although there are only a few maps at the moment, I hope that they add more interesting maps to the game as it develops.Unfortunately, there isn't much to the game if you're going in it for the single player. Basically you will be versing the AI and it will increase in difficulty as you go on, after about 4 battles of winning consistently with the same character then you have won. That's it, I feel like the game could have some more depth to the single player experience even though the game isn't focused upon it. Maybe some sort of big championship thing that you compete in or something just to give a bit more depth to the single player experience.The graphics of this game really give me, and maybe others, a very nostalgic feeling as the games graphics are heavily based upon older Zelda games. I really like the way that they also made each of the characters fit into the Zelda styled graphics making them all look like they have come from the original Zelda game.Pros+ Unique gameplay+ Interesting characters, maps & different spheres+ Each character has their own play styles+ Retro Zelda inspired graphics & CharactersImprovements- No way to change the controls for single or multiplayer, making playing multiplayer on the same keyboard difficult as your hands will be crossed over.- Lack of maps at the moment, but I'm sure there will be more interesting maps as the game gets developed more.- Single player could use a lot of work, maybe some sort of championship to compete in.- Although the game is only in local multiplayer, in this day and age of gaming I feel like there also should be a online multiplayer mode as well.Result / Final ThoughtsOverall, the current game in it's stage is fun and interesting to play. I feel like there is still a lot of improvements to be made while the game is still in Early Access, but at the moment you have a solid base game with a few characters, maps & Spheres and I would recommend to pick this up if you have another person to play with.For more reviews, spolight reviews, gaming news and more go check out PC games n news[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]website.
