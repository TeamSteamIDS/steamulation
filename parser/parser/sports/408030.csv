												This is by far my favorite game of all time. I found it in 2007 and it had already been around for 10 years when i had. The amount of game modes, and the stout teamwork/competition from its dedicated community is not duplicated from any other game. Pro: + Many maps that can support 2 players all the way to 99 players. Even 1v1v1v1 maps (or 2v2v2v2 or more!)+ Many modes including: Dodgeball, Racing, Hockey. Boxing, Tennis,  Corner Defence, Basketball and Eliminator which emulates the final round of american gladiators! + A chat lobby when you log into the game so you can actually talk to the community+ A way to see/observe any active game+ Many Leagues focuses on team and individual skill are going to be coming!+ Game is more than free to play, its free of pay, there arent even cosmetic items to buy+ Small file size / Easy to create an account (easy to share with friends and start up a game quick)Neurtral+/- Simple Graphics, for some people this will be bad, but i really am more focused on the gameplayIf you are interested in multiplayer games or sports this game is a must try. It is free and quick to download so there is no reason not to try it! I also have a youtube channel with some commentaries of some games check out my latest commentary!

												Uniball is one of the most rewarding and challenging games I’ve ever played. Players familiar with rocket league and haxball will immediately notice similarities in playstyle. With that being said, it is hard, it takes practice, and it has a solid learning curve. It also comes with a very experienced player community because the game is over 15 years old. New players can learn and practice a lot by playing with similarly skilled players and learn from those with much more experience. In Uniball's first launch on the steam platform, the developer has combined the two antiquated chat and game lobby clients, into a single seamless interface that can be launched from windows and mobile platforms (chat only).While the game does not currently offer an official ranked match making system upon release, it wouldn’t be too far of a stretch for one to be implemented in the future. In the past, player run leagues and ladders have been very successful in fueling competitiveness amongst the community. It will be interesting to see how those leagues translate over to the new steam version with newly integrated chat bot support. One of the major things Uniball has going for it, is that it does not maintain a low skill ceilings and dumb things down for the casual player. Players can easily draw strategic similarities from the likes of tradition mainstream sports such as soccer, basketball, hockey, and lacrosse. While the casual player can easily find fun and enjoyment in the game, players that wish to distinguish themselves from the pack can do so by exploiting the game’s complex but simple mechanics. Some players will pick things up quicker than others, but it can take a lifetime to master as the constantly evolving gameplay will continuously be shaped by those that play it.To summarize, below is a list of skills players can expect to manage and develop as a player.   Bouncing  Juking  Positioning (defensive, offensive)  Blocking  Boost conservation  Boost control  Graving (attracting the ball to your ship)  Strategy (traps, rotation, cuts, dives, blocks, lead passes, clears etc.)Uniball in my opinion is the closest thing you can get to as an actual, ‘esport’. Because of that, players can exhibit raw skill, but that skill can be constrained if they do not understand the strategy of the game. Similar to other sports players raw talent and understanding of how the sport is meant to be played goes hand-in-hand. I've played Uniball on and off since 2002 and it is my favorite game. Some games come and go, but this game always reels me back in time after time. It looks simple and has no flashy gfx, but the extremely competitive nature of the game play and community makes up for the rest. Thank you to the developer, NickW  (Stormbrewers), for all your hard work and continuing to develop a game that many of us grew up playing. May many more have the ability to do the same. "

												One day in the year 2000 I stumbled across a simple looking game called Uniball and decided to give it a try.Years later, I finally started going to meetings to break the habit.Now Uniball has been revamped and made available on Steam; and I'm enjoying every minute of my relapse!Uniball is a game that can be enjoyed differently at all levels.You'll learn how to play within a minute, but it'll take thousands of hours to come even close to mastering this highly competitive e-sport!

												This game is very simple - you have a little ship, you can rotate it, and you can hold onto a ball and shoot it. But once you start playing against others, you will find they are dribbling off walls, juking opponents, and making awesome plays.  Everyone has the same simple controls, but playing against someone who is good makes you feel like a 10 year old kid up against an NBA pro.  Luckily there are always ""noob"" games available to jump into, and the community is very open to new players.  There is something incredibly satisyfing about going head to head with opponents and beating them with creative plays and teamwork.			"

												I have played ub for years. Even though it is simple to learn and fun from the start, its hard to master and Its for that reason I never get bored with it. Do not allow the simplicity of the graphics to fool you, there is much involved including ball control, defense and teamwork etc. At the same time do not become overwhelmed for there is players of all levels including vets willing to help. I have played many other games like wow, swtor gw2 and the list goes on but its ub that  has outlasted them all.			"

												No free game has ever impressed me as much in the first 5 minutes. The controls are easy to learn but hard to master. Just enough of a learning curve to keep you hooked.If you have the aim of a Zumba master, the predictive eye of a Pong legend, and the teamwork of a Rocket League champ, then this is your next addiction.

												Uniball is the best game I've ever played, hands down. You pick up the basics of the game in 10 minute and then it takes years to master all of the intricacies of the game. Just an amazing gameplay experience and especially excellent for those who like to play computer games that don't require a $3000 PC to beat your opponents.			"

												This game is amazing and similar to rocket league. Solid mechanic gameplay as the base and iteration based on that. Main gameplay mechanics:-Tons of momentum. You slide everywhere, so skillfull use of brake is huge and prediction of your momentum.-Prediction of the ball bounces off walls. -You slow down if you have the ball. If enemy bumps you, you lose ball. So you have to pass cause you slow down with the ball-Mouse is direction of pass. WASD keys are direction of car. Takes getting used to.Tons of different maps and racing minigames. Amazing game and tons of fun. I'd probably pay up to 5$ for this. Maybe 10$ if the graphics were a bit more updated.			"

												I'm pretty sure I have no written reviews on any steam games in my library which can say a lot about me and the validity of this review; but the other way to see it is by me taking the time to write this review should say a lot about this game and how much I believe in it and that it deserves as much attention as it can and If my review can help then I'll do everything I can to make it so.This is one of those fun games that are quick and easy to pick up and get into the action but can take forever to fully master.  Uniball was one of the first PC games I got into playing when I first got a computer well over a decade ago.  It has stood the test of time and remained alive still till this day.  I'm excited for its steam release and to see how big the community can grow. I recommend you at least give this game a try.  If you've ever played the likes of SubCpace: Continuum, Soldat, Haxball and the such then you should be able to appreciate this game and have a good time.The only con would be its graphics but that can also be a positive because it means pretty much anyone can play this game even on a laptop.  Graphics can always be addressed later with the likes of say graphic packs.If you like competitive team based games then do yourself a favor and give this game a try!			"

												Uniball's an odd one. It was a little-known, but much loved home of online multiplayer skill-based future sports, with a lot of potential. Pretty much the Rocket League of its time, minus the money. It was, in many ways, terribly run, and didn't actually live up to its potential most of the time - but still, the game itself was designed well and controlled well, and the good times were awesome enough to make it a game that, while not regularly played, never left my hard drive.Being realistic about things, this new version probably isn't going to be much different, though the fact that there's a new version at all (and that it's on Steam) is pretty respectable in itself, and maybe we'll see other interesting updates from here. Whatever happens with it, the gameplay is still strong and I recommend checking it out. Maybe you'll fall into the regular crowd, maybe you'll be one of the outsiders waiting for the good games, or maybe you'll just appreciate it as a curiosity and wonder why you'd never heard of it back when it was revolutionary.

It is the closest thing you can get to real actual sports on a PC (without moving much). The thinking, skill, teamwork, competitiveness and momentum aspect is all there like real sports. I would recommened anyone to try this game and they will not be disappointed. It looks simple as any sport does but the time required to master and perfect that skill is just the same. A great Esport game. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Say hi if you see me in game and need any help!			"

												Uniball is one of the few games that I've played that is entirely skill based.  The basic mechanics are simple and the ships perform identically, which allows individual skill and team play to dictate the outcome of games.  Good players and teams will seldom lose to opponents with less skill, but really this is how it should be and is no different than any other sport played on a field or court.But this shouldn't discourage newer players.  The game is a blast to play at any level of skill and the staff and player base are eager to help new players find their way.In addition, it's possible to create private games where new players can play against their equally newbish friends and be terrible together, which is actually a lot of fun.

												Whilst Uniball may not be much to look at in comparison to games these days, the core gameplay more than makes up for it. The video previews perfectly demonstrate the amazing teamwork that can be experienced in game. This aspect of the game makes every match played different, and takes you through a full array of emotions as you compete against your opponents. Any fan of team sports should enjoy the tactical aspects, especially when getting up to the higher levels of skill, and playing with other similarly skilled players.The game is easy to pick up, but has aspects of play which make it hard to master. Whether you want to play some casual games, or get involved in a squad and perfect your skill, there is a place for you. The community has always been one of the best parts of Uniball, and is the reason the game has persisted for so long. This latest iteration of it makes it a lot more accessible, and I fully expect it to evolve further over time.Give it a try, it's a small download and well worth the price!			"

												Uniball is an older ""classic"" style game we were accustomed to playing growing up. It's the type of game that is easy to jump into and play, but requires time/practice if you want to hang with the best competitively. I played it a handful of times 10+ years ago. I come from another ""oldie but goodie"" game (ARC) that has no direct connection, but is fairly familiar to each other. It's refreshing to see that Uniball has withstood the years, despite some hardships perhaps, and is now on steam thriving. Since joining the lobby and playing a bit the last couple days, the current community already in place has been nothing but courteous and willing to help in any way they can. Very newbie friendly, which is a rarity in online gaming these days. I'm a bit jealous, as I see mostly the opposite on ARC on a regular basis. I would highly recommend giving UniBall a shot if you are looking for something that can offer that nostalgia some of us older gamers enjoy while still being challenged from a competitive standpoint.

												This game has been a blast so far and i have only played 1 hour of it, i love it truly to bits although i havent gotten the hang of the controls yet. I really hope this game achieves the level of attention it needs and takes off to maybe even esport levels or at least levels of players that will make it possible for the maker to implement more updates since the amount of players also will depend on the possibilities of updates.Notes: -Haven't raged so far, good sign-The people in servers that are way better than me don't get mad, but help out-This game is really fun			"

												One of the best up and coming games yet. The community is one of the best for starting players as everyone (mostly) is very polite towards you. The game itself is very interesting as it has so many different mechanics in such a simple idea. It is very well put together. I would strongly recommend this game to everyone.			"

												Uniball is the best game I have ever played! The game mechanics are very simple and easy to learn, but it needs much time to really master the game. There are lots of different maps with different game modes, which brings a broad variety to the game. Each player develops an individual play style, which prevents you from getting bored. And as Uniball is 100% free, without any hidden costs, it is a must to download it (just a few MB) and try it out for yourself!10/10			"

												Uniball has an incredibly steep learning curve, which can scare away some new players quickly. If you push through and really nail down the controls, it's a very fun game. Watching games with the highest-level players is very entertaining, and motivates you to get better. The better you get, the more fun it is. While experienced players are usually more than willing to play in games with new players and help out/provide tips, don't expect to actually hang with them until you put in a lot of hours mastering the mechanics.

												Did you grow up playing hockey on your old Windows 98 computer?  Have you ever played pong or wished that breakout was more competitive?  If the answer to either of these questions is yes then you just might like UniBall.In UniBall you play as a ship with about as much traction as a hockey player in a computer game has.  You have a limited sprint which lasts for a few seconds before it stops working well and will need to be recharged.Having only played two of the many game modes / maps available, I can say that UniBall is fairly easy to learn and a bit difficult to master.  As of writing I have played about 4 hours and can say for a fact that the game rewards teamwork and player skill.			"

												There are few games that truely capture the essence of e-sports. UniBall stands among the best of them. No leveling, no stats, no upgrades. This game is just pure skill based, and its an absolute joy to learn and watch yourself progress. You know that rush you get when you are watching a close football or basketball game? Well, when you are watching, or playing in, a game that is tied 9-9 (first to 10 wins) you will feel that simiar rush of adrenaline. I'd highly recommend giving this game a go. It has a die-hard core playerbase that has been around for 15-20 years. And they are some of the most helpful and friendly group of people around. 10/10 recommended.			"

												This game has been a part of my days since I first started playing games like Attack. Retrieve. Capture. It's longevity is a testament to how well a simple but fair competitive game can work when it is easy to pick up, but difficult to master.The community is what makes this game so strong. Don't feel lost or get frustrated when you first start; there are people there to help if you listen and are patient.Once you get a feel for the basics, the teamplay of this game keeps you coming back for more. That one dribble, that one nice pass, that shot where you thread the needle between two defenders. These feelings you just don't get from every game out there.Welcome to steam Uniball!			"

												UniBall is one of the longest-standing games on the internet.It has been in beta, for several years, and seen many periods of isolation from its players, though, presently, a lot of the old players are coming back. It expresses a great learning curve, though it may seem built for the elites, this game teaches things about movement, intuition, teamplaying, and how to work with another person on the internet.In fact, I believe if you become skilled at playing UB, your intuition, and natural abilities IRL will improve since it is such a profoundly unique game to natural physics; employing ""gravity"" and ship movements based perhaps on actual laws of this world.If you were to play UniBall tonight, you would likely see a large number of faces to whom were once players of this game well over ten, to even fifteen years ago, however, you will also find a great degree of respect toward the new player, since this is by far one of the most challenging games to learn in a day.I myself have played UB for over 16 years, which began in late 1999.In spite of UniBall's learning curve, however, I have noticed a great and rather profound degree of skill in the new player recently. The fact that it took me (myself) over three months to master dribbling, I have somewhat found myself very impressed with some of the skill in the new players of UB.Tutorials, articles, and etc. will be written to advance the first few days of the new player, if not by myself, then by other players, and hopefully all of the vets, and new players, alike, can get along in this terribly unique game.Please log in with hope, and don't disregard the fact that this is a very different game from most games on the internet. It is, in my opinion, the ""best"" game on the internet. I have held true to this opinion for the entirety of my career there, and I have even played with its original creator, to whom I once interviewed, a very skilled programmer. The resident programmers of UB have great skill, and also the administration of UB has proven very effective over the past few years.One last mention is a man named ""Zoop"" who you may see in the chatroom. If you see him, don't be afraid to ask for help. He will give you guidance, because he truly cares about the game of UniBall. This game is worth playing. It deserves attention.

Originally posted by President Obama:This game is the gorgeous love child of Pong and Rocket LeagueUniball is by far one of the simplest yet most complex games I have ever played. If you have any interest in competitive team vs team type games this is definitely worth a try. Once you start playing UB you will find an endless amount of fun. PROS: Friendly Community Easy to pick up the basics Very creative community Many different maps and game types High level of replay-ability  ChatroomCONS: Very high learning curve  It takes time to understand the physics of the game There are a few aspects of the learning curve that you wont learn without someone telling you (ex:Proper boost management) Most of these learning curve issues will resolve themselves overtime while you play, similar to most other games (See: Rocket League)  Lack of training mode (This is resolved by many people that would be willing to teach you, just ask in the chatroom)Long story short, this game is easy to learn the basics but hard to master. Something about it will keep you coming back for more. I highly recommend you check it out and stick around for a bit. "

												The graphics aren't very fancy, but the gameplay is very fun and addictive. Controlling your ship is very hard for the first say 30 minutes, but then you start ""getting it"" and you see the great gameplay potential behind what appears to be a simple game. Make sure you play on the servers with the lowest ping for you, it makes a big difference in how easy it is to control the ship!			"
