Blood Bowl: Chaos EditionMany people will tell you that Blood Bowl is unfair. Other people will tell you the RNG is rigged. Yet other people will defend it with their lives. Blood Bowl is just not a game that respects you, especially if you go out there and try to win by murder. It will spank you, waterboard you and then anally invade you with spiked baseballbat that has glasshards glued on for good measure.I have had my trial by fire on the boardgame and got butchered by experienced players. It was enough to not want to play anymore, mostly because of the discussions with the rulebook in hand. Yet, I was also constantly drawn back to it until I got absorbed by Epic and built myself a nice Eldar army.But then I got the 360 version and was hit over the head with a game that applies the rulebook to a fault. No more sneaking stuff past my opponent, no more obfuscating the rules with 'you're interpreting the rules wrong, muppet!'. Instead, I got steamrolled over and over again, until I wised up and started to take the full time allowance on a turn, always trying to get at double dice on every action that needs them. I begun to make progress, but the on-line was so horrid I turned away from the game.Today, I decided to buy the Chaos Edition for PC on a whim. Fact is that I'm not that into GW-games anymore. I sold off my hobby some time ago, mostly because I outgrew the demographic. Whenever I walk into the GW-store, I feel like a child-molester for one and inviting a kid over to play a game of Epic just has too many negative connotations to it.Getting back in the saddle was easier than I thought, but much of that is in selecting the team that supports my play-style instead of a team that looks bad♥♥♥♥♥but is a dog to manage.Blood Bowl looks very pretty to my eyes. Cyanide did not go for flashy imagery but instead kept it simple and to the point. Game music is likewise utilized and during the matches there is a duo-presentation by two dudes who sadly will have run out of new things to say after you've played a few matches.I have not yet played with the Blitz rules, opting to play Classic-rules (Read GW-authentic) instead. The Classic-rules play by the boardgame rules and follows that ruleset to the letter, which results in nailbiting matches, as long as you play on Hard. I don't say this to be leet. On Easy, you'll win. On Medium, the AI will anally probe you. On hard, the AI gets slammed by the rules as hard as you are. How that can be, I don't know. The game was like this on the 360 too.Winning thus depends on team-choice and choosing a team should be a factor of your playstyle. For me personally that meant a choice between the Dark Elves or the Amazons. After having tried a few games with the Dark Elves I noticed that I couldn't pull off miracle plays with them. I like to dodge and play a passing game and the Dark Elves are the proverbial team for that. (Still the best DLC I bought on the 360.)I started over, going for the Amazons this time, who all have Dodge as a natural skill. At first I felt it was hopeless, but slowly I was getting the results. After being butchered a few times, I got a handle on the Amazons and started to fight the AI to a stand-still. Some time later I managed to win a match with a miracle play, passing the ball from the midfield-line to a Catcher in the end-zone.Blood Bowl is not an easy game. One of the first things a new player should learn is that tackle-zones are the backbone of Blood Bowl. Each pawn on the field has a tackle-zone, consisting of 8 squares around that pawn. Pawns that have overlapping tackle-zone empower eachother, making offence and defence easier. For offence, blocking an enemy pawn is a snap if it has base to base contact with other pawns that are friendly to you. For defence, understanding that tackle-zones are only good for enemy pawns entering it is key.As you play matches, your players will level up, provided they did something that gives them points. There are many ways a player can get EXP and not all of them are obvious. Blood Bowl does however apply them according to the official boardgame rules (if you play Classic, which I recommend.) and does so rigidly. Should you ever question the game's judgement, crosscheck the decision with the ruleset, which is included in the game. I have not been able to fault it sofar.Leveling your players up will allow you to give your players extra skills. There are loads of skills, but not all of them will suit your players or your style. Take the time to read the description of skills. But most of them are obvious. The first extra skill a Catcher should get is Sure Hands. A Runner should get Sure Feet quickly. A Blitzer should keep an eye out for Break-Tackle.Blood Bowl comes with a hefty Single Player experience. First there is the tutorial. This is scripted as heck and it won't allow you to experiment. But for new players it does open the game a little, though it won't go into specifics. Therefore it's better to play a few exhibition matches after you've done the tutorial.The Exhibition matches are perfect for experimenting, because they don't have a persistent effect on your team. Work on your starting set-up and watch the AI closely. Here you get the goods on how teams are played, which is unvaluable information for the other game-modes. Many tactics the AI employs are also good to use by you.Begin a Campaign is a set mode where you buy the team of your choice (or field one of your existing teams) and try to reach the top of the different leagues and tournies.Begin a Competion is like the Campaign, but now you set it up to your specifications before you start play.Story Mode is very different as you're free-agent coach who coaches teams that need your expertise. This time, the focus is on you and your managerial skills. And you'll be tested. Hard.World Cup is like the wolfmother of Blood Bowl. Hear you must lead your team to greatness entering nothing but tournaments and your goal is to eventually qualify for the ultimate event.All these modes can't be completed in a single evening. These modes are all in depth and content rich and successfully completing them will take your dedication and test your motivation.Don't go into this game believing that you'll trash it on your first match. Learn from the AI, see how it handles ball-possession and see how it defends. A wise man once said that no one ever learned something from winning and nowhere is this more true than in Blood Bowl.-Do safest actions first.-Do less safe actions second.-Do dangerous actions last.-Always guard your ballcarrier.-Buy re-rolls pre-game over stuff like Bribes and Bloodweiser Babes.-Cheerleaders and Coaches are the most helpful during kick-offs. Look for other things to buy first.-Use fouls and bribes to disable enemy keyplayers, like Catchers, Throwers and Runners. Don't waste them on rank and file.-Try to use all your re-rolls in a half, they get replenished at half-time. Re-rolls are instrumental to your play, so don't let them go to waste, use them as needed and don't be frugal with them thinking that you'll get a better chance to use them later.I love digital Blood Bowl, but the love took a wile to take hold. Blood Bowl rewards the patient, thinking player and it really opens up to those that stick with it and gain skill. Once you get past the disappointment of playing a game that won't let you win and start to recognize what works and what doesn't, Blood Bowl is one of the more rewarding games to play.For those that want to always win and who want to be leet 24/7, Blood Bowl has little to offer.

												Blood Bowl is a...How to put this? Turn based fantasy sport satire boardgame?It's quite unique, and I have difficulty describing it in a simple way so I will explain the gameplayYou have a team of 11-16 pieces(Your players), and you face off against a team of similar size. Only up to 11 per team can be on the field at once. It is vaguely remniscent of American Football(Handegg for you Europeans out there), where you have a ball and you need to run it into your opposition's endzone to score. Different from the sport however is that you take turns moving your pieces. This leads to a more strategic and tactical game, with the dice-based mechanics making it mainly a challenge of risk avoidance, while maximising the risk for your opponent.Of course, being a Warhammer universe, there are races other than humans. And everything is much more violent. It is not unusual for a team to have players die on the field, or to have them permanently injured. And tactics are much less throwing balls and passing for the less dextrous races(Orks tend to not have a great catcher for one, and the passing game of a dwarf team is notorious for being poor), and more other things. Stalling, outmanouvering your opponent, or just plainly trying to beat them all to a pulp and walk right through them are options. There are plenty of tactical choices to be made, and several strategic ones as well - A team can last you a very long time, and knowing how to build the skills on your team is crucial to your success in the later matches.In the end, it is a very interesting game. It has a little something for everyone, from amazing comebacks out of a long pass by an elf team to the pure carnage of a band of orks having themselves a good old brawl while there just happens to be a ball in the mix somewhere, to entirely other playstyles entirely.While often I think of something to say that would let you know whether or not you'll like it, the only way to know for sure with Bloodbowl is to try.It's very hit and miss.  If you end up enjoying it, you can get a long, long time out of your money. And if not, well. It was cheap(If you got it on sale), and you tried. And even then, it's a great game to play with a friend while just talking or doing something else on the side. Blood Bowl Chaos edition includes all content of Legendary edition.New in Chaos edition are three new teams/races you can pick, none of them overpowered so you are not buying power here, while at the same time being 100% compatible with Legendary edition.There are extra voice lines, a new stadium, and a new price tag!Buying Chaos edition gets you all the content in Legendary as well, so you can consider it the 'full edition' at this point. (Before Bloodbowl 2 anyway)Is it worth a whole 10 bucks more? Up to you. But do know that during sales it is often available for a much cheaper price, a total of 7,50 seems to be customary.Worth it on sale? You bet it is. Worth it for everyone? As before, maybe. But I do recommend giving it a try just in case you like it. Because if you do, you'll wonder where the hours went, and why the sun is coming up already.I highly recommend Cknoor and his group for both learning to play, finding the fun in the game if you're not sure on what to amuse yourself with, and finding people to play withhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/cknoorbowl "

												If you like strategy and wargaming, you'll like this game.  But be warned:  it's hard, unforgiving, and frustrating as hell.A lot of people buy this game without having a background in wargaming type games, and they start thinking the RNG is broken.  I can understand that, because it can be frustrating to play well then get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked down the field because of bad dice rolls.  But that's how wargames are - you're making strategy based on the odds of the rolls.If you can get that in your head, then you can start to learn the strategies - like doubling up on blocks to improve your odds.  Making use of the special skills of the various players.  Changing tactics against teams based on if they pass, brawl, etc.It took me a good 12 hours to get the hang of it, and I've been playing wargames a long time.  I'm finally starting to win against the AI.  I played one online game, and they other player mopped the pitch with me, so I need a lot more practice.But if you have the patience to develop the skills, you'll find this a lot of fun (even though it's very frustrating).  I also recommend looking for various online strategy guides that will help you with concepts / tactics like ""The Cage"", etc.  It reduces the learning curve and makes the game enjoyable sooner.			"

												10/10 awesome game.If you enjoyed this on the tabletops as much as I did, it's a no-brainer.If you've never played the board version of this game it's definitely worth picking up in a sale. it's one of those quick-to-pick-up games with some interesting challenges in ""story"" mode, but the real game is mastered in the online leagues. There are a number of leagues available from the beginners league to the specialities like ""no bash"" (where ""bashy"" races such as Orc and Dwarf are not allowed entry). Which means that you will be sure to find a match to suit you for style and player experience.On top of that of course there are Private Leagues.If you have a group of friends looking to find a good fun 2-player game which runs 1-2 hours then look no further.One last thing: In some sale conditions it can work out cheaper to buy Legendary edition AND Chaos edition than it is to buy Chaos Edition by itself.

												This game is a conversion of the classic Blood Bowl tabletop game. It takes the rules that required hours upon hours of bickering in real life to being automatically resolved. This saves you quite a bit of frustration, even if the dice rolls will still make your perfect team die horribly at the game's whim. If you liked the board game, you will like this game.However, if you haven't played the board game, it's an acquired taste. You'll need to be able to accept that your rolls will dictate your fate, that your best player, that you've built up with the best possible upgrades, can die at any time, and that even if you play with perfect strategy, some times you will fail anyway. It's a brutal system, but it can provide a lot of long-term satisfaction if you have the patience for it.Note: (The game is way more fun to play with a group of friends in tournament mode)			"

												This game falls in one of two categories: You will love it immensely, or you will hate it and wish you never played it. For starters, it has a tremendously high learning curve. I've put my share of time in with both this and the legendary edition and I'm still learning new tactics. Couple that with every single team having their own specific playing style that you need to learn to a certain degree, and you have a death sentence for a new player that isn't patient enough to actually learn the ins and outs of the game.If you can get passed that, it CAN be a tremendously fun game. There are few things more satisfying then a miracle touchdown play on the last turn of a game. It can also be so incredibly disheartening that you'll rage quit instantly. That is the nature of a game built around rolling dice though. Tragedy is around every corner.So what is it? A sports game? Sort of. It's most accurately a competitive turn-based strategy game that isn't balanced. Some teams are specifically there for scoring and making exciting plays. Others are there to break those teams and kill as many players as possible. A third type is a gimmick sort of styled team that can be fun if you can work your way around their (potentially broken) achilles' heel.There are 23 teams in total in this game, providing enough variety that if you feel like you're not enjoying the game, it could just be you're not playing the right team. For example, my favorite team to play is Lizards. They can bash with the best of them, but the skink ball carriers are more than capable of doing some miracle-esque types of plays that make things exciting. However, I can't stand playing with (or against for that matter) slower, more hit-aggressive teams like Orcs or Dwarves, as they don't bring as much of a high octane energy that I enjoy. The enjoyment this game brings you starts and ends with the teams you pick. I also recommend having a friend play this with you and not just jump into a league (public or private), as that will be good practice. It will also bring less of a feeling of angst when you start, as (hopefully) either they can help you learn OR you'll learn together. So, all in all, it can be quite fun. I recommend it, but be warned this game is not easy to play, and can be emotionally crushing if you get invested in a team only to have your star players get killed by a blown dice roll.			"

												It's Blood Bowl. What's not to like. Haven't tried the fancy ""Blitz"" rules - just playing the Classic game.If you're a fan of the ""real"" Blood Bowl, but can't paint a figure to save your life (like me) or have no friends (like me) or don't have time to set up the table all the time (like me) or just want to sit down and have a quick nostalgic game of horribly wonderful how-can-the-dice-always-come-up-to-my-disadvantage-at-the-most-crucial-moment-in-a-drive (like me) - don't miss out.Single player is surprisingly enjoyable and competitive - and there's hot-seat multiplayer, so you can deal out some Norse-style smash-mouth Blood Bowl on the big screen in the living room too. This is Mario Kart for people who never had a Nintendo. Gratuitous swearing, cursing, beer-drinking and Pantera-listening goes very well with this game.			"

												I had the legendary edition previously and was holding out for BloodBowl 2. I was disappointed with what i saw and even more disappointed with the wave upon wave of issues Blood Bowl 2 has. At 75% off I was convinced that I might as well finally opt for Chaos edition as I had always wanted to play chaos dwarfs anyway. Initially I was put off by 'made-up' new teams but the Khorne and Underworld teams add some variety that remains balanced in line with others. Rest of the additions is simply more of what we had before.....If you want to get into Blood Bowl then by far your best option is to ignore 2 and get Chaos edition of Blood Bowl 1. If you have either of other versions of Blood Bowl 1, then stick with what you've got unless you REALLY want to play one of the 3 new teams.I loved Blood Bowl on tabletop and this version of the game is the best available! Highly recommended!			"

												I started the North American TTS League and even after giving up being the commissioner I still cast games of Blood Bowl from them.  This is a true to life adaptation of the Blood Bowl board game and will not disappoint you fans out there.  However for folks that don't know anything about the game, there is a LARGE learning curve that even single player still doesn't teach you correctly.  Here's the most recent game from the NATTS league and see for yourself:

												Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition is a fantasy football video game with the option for turn based or real time game play. This game is an expansion to Blood Bowl that was developed in 2009 by Cyanide and published Focus Home Interactive and is based on the board game ""Blood Bowl"" that is produced by Games Workshop.Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition has a great variety of game modes available for both single player and multiplayer that will keep you entertained for days providing the dice gods don't come down on you too harshly.It is however recommended that you play using Classic mode and playing using turn based due to the fact that blitz mode is an awful edition to the game since it does not fit in well and functions clumsily.There are a 23 races to choose from in Blood Bowl chaos edition and helps to add a nice variety to the teams you come up against, some races share similar players but overall there is a lot to choose from and picking what team you want to play as can take quite some time.Blood Bowl: Chaos Editions graphics are perfectly suitable for what it is trying to achieve and generally looks visually pleasing and adds a fair amount of detail into the surroundings and units, for a game made in 2009 you defiantly can't complain.On lower difficulty settings the AI make irrational moves that tend to lead to costly mistakes, while the higher levels of AI provide some challenge but you most likely will want to look for opposition using multiplayer.If you want a faithful recreation of the board game Blood Bowl this is the only video game you should currently choose to try out due to the fact that it is quite high quality and is a quite compelling experience overall.I highly recommend that you give this game a try if you like a challenging board game-esque strategy game.Rating - 8 - A must buy!           Advantages	                             - Compelling Game play                - Lots of variety- The best of its kind on the market         Disadvantages- Irrational AI at lower difficulties			"

												Rather than going for an re-interpretation of the Warhammer table-top game (Dawn of War), this game takes the Warhammer Fantasy football game ""Blood Bowl"" and ports it perfectly onto PC. The game itself plays a lot like chess, with a turn based system in which one team attempts to score as many goals as possible (as you'd expect). The difference between Blood Bowl and an ordinary game of football, however, lies in the fact you can maim, bribe and murder the other team if you so desire, making for some intersting matches to say the least. The selection of teams is diverse, with each having their unique feel and playstyle instead of just being re-skins of the same team. If you're considering getting into the tabletop version, I most certainly recommend playing this first as it can teach you the basics of the game and is incredibly fun to play with friends. Don't enable the real-time option if you value your sanity.			"

												BB must be judged in two seperate ways: as a boardgame, and as a pc game.As a boardgame, it is an extremely interesting, very deep, beautifully balanced strategy boardgame. The variety of races, skills, and the fact that each team's playing style, potential and builds are truly unique and different, make it stand out.The only fact that may discourage or frustrate players, is that luck may make or break a game of blood bowl. The game is intentionally made so, that anything can fail quite miserably, or succeed quite unexpectedly, if one is lucky enough. To some players this is intense and exciting, to others it is maddening and rage-inducing. Avoid, if you count yourself among the latter.In general, it is one of the most interesting boardgaming experiences one may have.As a pc game, it does have some advantages. It is pretty solid, and the multiplayer works excellently - it is relatively easy to find an opponent, and many times, even if one player loses connection momentarily, it succeeds in reconnecting. The community is usually friendly, and bad manners aren't that common.On the negative side, everything other than the online multiplayer is laughably bad. The game doesn't feature any interactive way to teach you the rules of BB - of which there are many - and you have to learn them by reading the pdf rulebook. The single player campaign's AI is horribly bad; so bad, that playing vs AI has no value whatsoever, as the computer's moves are illogical, and the team builds it uses are unorthodox and usually worthless. Blitz mode is amazingly awful and doesn't deserve looking at.Concludingly, I would say, BUY THIS GAME.But only if you are fully aware what you're getting into: a deep, complex, multiplayer strategy boardgame with a steep learning curve. Oh, and visit bbtactics.com, it will make starting up a lot easier. Good luck, have fun.			"

												Blood Bowl is an adaptation of a tabletop game by the same name that was created by Games Workshop. It takes place in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy universe where all of the races decide to settle their differences playing games of American Gridiron Football.Much of the aesthetic of Blood Bowl was nailed perfectly. The look of the more general races like the Humans resemble 1950's caricatures of Football players. While the more fantastical races like the Undead look like mummified quarterbacks. There's a significant amount of content in this release, with a total of 23 races. Each with their own unique roster of players and distinctive gameplay balance.My favorite aspect of Blood Bowl is it's extensive singleplayer experience that also appears in the multiplayer. If your players get injured this carries over into subsequent matches, and if they die you lose them forever. Your players also level up and gain Fallout style perks. It reminds me a great deal of strategy games like X-Com. The entire game is turn based and every action in the game is determined through rolling a 6 sided die. It is a surprisingly faithful recreation of the original tabletop game, which puts off a lot of players as a result. Blood Bowl gets frequently referred to as an ""RNG game with a mix of strategic elements"". Which I personally disagree with. The random elements to the game make the game stand out to me compared to a lot of other strategy games. Where you can have a player void his entire turn because of a botched pass, forcing you to adapt. The meta of the game as a result revolves around minimizing the amount of rolls you might have to make, taking full advantage of your teams strengths. Because of these random elements, succeeding with a plan feels much more earned than it normally would be in any other strategy game. You feel that Ork score a touchdown, you feel your team win a tournament. It all feels really good when you win. Which brings me to my criticisms of the game. While Cyanide did a hell of a job adapting the rules, the game doesn't really explain very core fundamentals. Things like the balance between the races, roster selection, and even what particular plays are more effective over others. Blood Bowl is a game that requires practice and most importantly patience. You won't fully learn the game without losing several matches and clocking in upwards of 10 hours into it even. It takes a lot of reading guides and practice to really understand how to play it. But that's one of the most satisfying aspects of Blood Bowl. To me it's a turn based strategy game that's willing to anger you, that's willing to grind your teeth, that's willing to paint facepaint on your cheeks and dump Gatorade down your throat. This game is one of the finer examples of injecting variety into an otherwise bland sports game, and it really makes you feel like you're playing it in both body and mind.One last thing to note is the ""Chaos"" edition to the game is the complete version, with more content than the Legendary edition. While you can play online with players from the Legendary edition, it comes highly recommended to get this version to recieve the full experience.			"

												A great adaptation of the classic GW board game. With Chaos edition we have 3 new teams added: Underworld, Daemons of Khorne and finally Chaos Dwarves. Underworld are a real blast to play and with easy access to mutations can be a really visually pleasing team to play. Khorne Daemons can be quite tricky to play due to a high concentration of frenzy on their players but can really be bashy and have the best Big Guy in the game in their Bloodthirster. Overall pretty fun especially amongst friends although the RNG can be a bit extreme in it's results			"

												My old review for this was positive. And it technically still is. Blood Bowl is a great game. The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.Keyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.Ordinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.

												I HATE THIS GAME!!!!!  why you might ask? its because I stink at dice games. I have been cursed by the gaming gods so that I only can throw bad rolls of the dice. This is why I HATE this game because it´s so funny to play and is well made, but I keep getting bad rolls so I keep screaming in my head, ""WHY THE HELL DO I KEEP COMMING BACK TOO THIS GAME!?!?!?"" I keep coming back because the teams are interesting, the gameplay and meckanic is supreme and it is easy to learn. But if you have a short fuse when it comes to dice games, then maybe you should look somewhere else (it is to late for me). for when you start playing, you keep coming back for more punishment and hopes for glory.

												Blood Bowl - Warhammer Fantasy ""Football"" to the death. Turn based game with a ""Blitz"" mode for more dynamic play. Click Here  for the most comprehensive review I've seen on this game with some play pointers as well.This game is difficult at best, can seem impossible at first and is not for someone who can't learn from a loss. Sometimes you play a team that can't be beaten - until your players level up, gain extra skills and then next time it's a different story.It's a faithful adaptation of the board game - and it's as hard as week old bread that's been sitting unbagged on the windowsill. Play the tutorial and keep in mind - players have an area effect around them - overlapping adds to your chance of success - do easy plays first - harder plays second and risky plays last - or risk that turnover.Get it on sale and you won't be sorry - but don't expect anything like football - or futbol - It's freaking Blood Ball!

												If you like Blood Bowl or playing games with turn based strategy you must play that game, you'll love it.If you have not ever played Blood Bowl you should try with this version, keeps the spirit of the game with a great diversity of races and units, with a lot of explanations about the rules. Remember you can download the rules on pdf at the internet for free.There are two ways to play a match: classic (as the original) and ""not turn based"", I´ve only played classic one so I cannot talk about the other system.I really recommend it.

												Incredibly steep learning curve. Oh yes indeedy. If, like me, you have never played blood bowl on the tabletop then be warned, you will be smashed down harder than you have ever been smashed down by a video game. Despite that, once you get the hang of it, it does become very fun. You might even win and those wins, oh boy those glorious wins.

												Once you get past the dregs of online matchmaking and join one of the four or five very active communities with organised tourneys and leagues, blood bowl online becomes a very enjoyable experience.This is the edition that has everything and I heartily recommend it.If you do play it, I recommend reading the rulebook (just google blood bowl rulebook). Although the game generally works very well, it's much more enjoyable when you sit yourself down to the actual rules. It's a little bit of work, but these rules were honed through years of playtesting and active experience and what has come out makes sure that every game is exciting, unpredictable and challenging. Above all it's a game that teaches one to learn to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations you can be put in or marvel at the gutsy gambles that have paid off.Not recommended for people that dislike chance as a whole; you can minimize the risk to a great amount and the winner of league is generally the better player, but the winner of a match is sometimes decided by the dice gods.My very first game my most expensive player was hit and killed by a rock thrown by the audience; before I had even made a single decision. If that kind of thing sounds like fun, this game might be for you.			"

												BB has its bugs (still).  BB has a horribly atrocious UI (especially in online multiplayer/league management).  It may take a while to figure out how to even get to play a match.  I haven't given the real-time mode much of a chance, but I haven't heard good things.  Oh and let's not forget the single player AI is pretty terrible.  Any veteran of turn-based strategy games With all that ugly.  This game is one of my top 10 games.  I would expect most turn-based strategy players to really enjoy this game.  The strategy and depth between teams while maintaining balance is fantastic.    I suppose that happens when a game's rules have been evolved over decades.  Setup a league with a few friends, and you will find your group endlessly discussing tactics.Be forewarned!  Everyone's luck sucks in the game!  It is maddening and frustratingly awesome.  I constantly swear that the RNG gods are against me in every match.  It is a game of weighted risk management.  As your team evolves, new unique dynamics to your team emerge.  It gives every team a personality.  You will have some pretty big emotional highs and lows every time your team steps onto the pitch!			"

												This game is a ton of fun, though it's vast ruleset can be intimidating at first.  It's based on a somewhat high level table top board game and plays out like one in video game form.  Blood Bowl is a game of incredible depth and takes a serious amount of time to learn to do it well.  But if you do take that time and understand that this game is all about managing risk, you'll find it very rewarding in a reasonable amount of time.  While it might seem like a relaxing sit-back-and-click type take on the sports genre, it's rather tense.  Building your own teams, naming the players, and leveling them up has you second and third guessing each decision.  These players become extensions of you to a point, and risking them can be difficult!  The emotional and strategic depth in this game is unlike anything I've experienced.  I can't reccomend it enough for fans of table top board games or fans who might be into a sports/rpg hybrid.I had played Blood Bowl 2 on the consoles first, which gives you a pretty good understanding of the rules and the risks involved.  This version is much more complete, with many more races to choose from than BB2. Like more than twice more.  The graphics aren't as good but this game runs well even on my old beatup laptop.  And it doesn't look bad.  The controls and interface is fantastic as I always feel like I'm making the move I want to make.  I know some of the negative reviews seem to be people who had frustrating dice rolls.  I promise that this game was never meant to be that hard.  It's supposed to be a deep table top board game at it's core, but it's not supposed require hours and hours of research before playing.  You will fail, but as long as you can understand why you fail in a rather short time you'll learn the rules pretty quickly.  I'm not the biggest fan of table top games in the world and I managed to learn the rules.  Pro tip: If you want additional resources theres a YouTuber named cKnoor who has excellent beginner and intermediate level strategy videos.  They helped my game immensely.			"

												Blood Bowl is a game that exists. You can play this video game, if you wish. In this video game, you command a bloodthirsty team of muscular men or busty women or weird monster things or a combination of all three and have a friendly toss-about of the old pigskin with another team. Oh sure, occasionally someone's arm breaks, or their eyes are gouged out, and in certain circumstances a player dies, but these are all minor details to be overlooked.This is a turn based take on American Football with fantasy teams and themes, accompanied by an ungodly amount of violence, cursing and Big Moot sandwiches.I'm not sure what more to say. It's an incredibly fun game solo and it's an incredibly fun game with friends, and a very nice take on the tabletop original game, bringing more content to a more accessible medium of gaming. Games also don't take nearly as long and the game does all of the tedious dice rolling for you. No, the game doesn't hate you, the dice does. No, it's not rigged. No, you can't roll the dice yourself. No, it's not the game's fault that your wood elf failed his dodge and is now laying on the ground with his spine shattered in several places. It's your fault. You ♥♥♥♥ed up. Get good. Get Blood Bowl!..God, that was awful. 10/10 game though.			"

												Make absolutely sure you're okay with a game completely screwing you by RNG over and over and over and over again before making this purchase.  Even if you play perfectly and make every objectively correct move while playing, the game will still roll 1s which will still guarantee failure of your plays.  The offline AI is flawed to make it poor for practice, because while it is brutal the only recommendations by players online is to exploit a few flaws in it that make it predictable and easily beaten rather than having you learn good strategy.Other than that, it's an okay game.  Not worth the money, though.  If you really need to scratch that Blood Bowl itch, FUMBBL.com doesn't have the uncommon bug this game tends to have and plays with the exact same rules with even more player activity even during non-peak hours.

												You would never think a game like this can make you so emotional. The joy of the double Go-For-It! touchdown without a re-roll. The Fury of rolling four attacker downs at the begining of your turn. The fear of losing you star player to a pitch invasion. The unrelenting sadness of said star player getting killed by a blitzing Orge...Sorry, got off topic. This is literal fantasy football, with everything that entails. Teams consist of Elves, Dwarves, and other fantasy staples. Wizards are hurling spells onto the field. Blood and limbs flying as teams of heavily armed and armored individuals try to move the ball down the field.The game has a handful of different modes where you can make a team take them through competitions. It also supports exporting the team you create to use in exhibition matches. Where this game shines, however, is online play. Get a group of friends together and start a league. Revel as your chainsaw wielding goblin takes out that annoying guy from chemistry's reciever. Laughs will be had, tears will be shed, and there is a good chance someone will die on the field.That's Blood Bowl.			"

The turn based games can punish errors quickly but the game is won when willingness to take risks and luck come together. This is all backed up with player experience, team cash management and the risk of injury or death to any participants.The many teams can offer different plays styles from ball handling finesse to simply bashing the enemies heads in. Game play is dice controlled and nuffle can be dangerous.Overall I enjoyed slugging away at the matches and experiementing with different team builds.

												Don't let the sports theme fool you: this is a hardcore tabletop-based wargame in which everything from your overarching gameplan down to the mere sequence in which you move your players can spell the difference between victory and defeat.THE GOOD+The rules are easy to understand at the basic level, with the more complex players' skills adding depth as your team progresses.+Excellent sense of progression in watching your players gain experience and acquire new skills that let you custom-tailor your team.+An amusing tongue-in-cheek universe that provides outstanding fluff to the game.+Dozens of premade teams that allow you to jump right into the action if you don't feel like dealing with the aspects of managing your own.+An inducement system that keeps games between teams of different developmental levels competitive, without completely negating the advantages of a well-developed squad.THE BAD-The game seems tailored for those experienced with the tabletop version, resulting in a rather lackluster tutorial. Though it does an adequate job of teaching the mechanics of the game, you're mostly left on your own to figure out the best ways to make use of those mechanics. You should look up fansites to read up on some effective tactical doctrines if you don't feel like learning through trial-and-error. Fortunately, they're easy to find.-Missing some of the races from the current version of the tabletop rules, as well as a large number of Star Players (special players you can hire to play for your team for one game only, usually as part of the inducement system).THE MIXED*Only marginal in terms of balance. There's a great amount of customization that lets you remain competitive, but there are some skills that are just flat-out better than others, and some races that have intrinsic advantages over others.*There's in-game announcing, fitting with its sports theme, but limited variety means you'll be hearing the same things over and over before long. Still, I like hearing the announcers, because they give some amusing anecdotes from and comments on the universe's rich fluff and history.*The game sticks rather faithfully to the tabletop rules, which means many things from success or failure on the field to a degree of player progression are determined by dice rolls. This can be alternatingly thrilling and frustrating, and although the random aspects aren't enough to negate skill, it's important to remember that nothing is ever certain in Blood Bowl.*Player turnover. Some people like constantly raising new players, while others may be upset when their star player dies. Don't get too attached to your players, because the game is called Blood Bowl for a reason.*The sheer number of player skills, while good in the long run, can be a bit overwhelming at first until you've managed to memorize what they all do and how to take advantage of them.*The many different races, while each offering unique roster possibilities, tend to fall broadly into variations of 2-4 general playstyles rather than each offering truly unique gameplay opportunities.CONCLUSIONIf you like turn-based strategy games, this is an easy recommendation. If you like turn-based strategy games, bloody carnage, and a rich, amusing setting, this is a must-have.			"

												The dice are exceedingly unforgiving. My paranoia wants to suggest that the RNG's been messed with to have 1s on 50% of the rolls (this isn't true).  If you can put up with the annoyance of rolling 1s on every other roll and having your star players die at every turn, then this is a nice little smash up of combat football and chess. If Nuffle chooses his favorite and it's not you, prepare to lose to scores like 5-0 and 6-0.			"

												This game is so much fun. It takes some time and energy to understand what's going on, but there's a deep and engaging system to learn here. Great for anyone who likes sports and wargames. I love all of the variation between the different teams and all of the options available to customize your players as they advance. The fact that they can get permanent injuries and die adds to the suspense.The company who makes it is shady to have put out so many similar releases just to add extra teams and looks to be even shadier in the future to make people pay for individual teams with the sequel. You might be better off to just buy this complete game rather than get bled over time as they hold back content.			"

												I can highly recommend BBCE, but anyone should know its a board game and dices are thrown, so some games can go weird and you gotta love this or end up being frustrated.Everyone who understands that, is able to calculte his chances and can still laugh if dice outcomes go weird will have LOTS of fun. While writing this i have more than 2300 hours spent playing or watching Blood Bowl games that says much about the potential of having fun. Best way to play it for me is looking for private leagues and getting to know your opponents, so talking to them while playing makes it more of a board game again...The only downsides are:some connectivity issues in MP for some players now and thena few bugs never got patched outrunning your own leagues you often miss some better administration optionsBut these are few and the amount of races to play and fun you have makes it up.Since nobody knows how long the servers will run, buy it on a sale and it can still be a great catch.

												Outstanding port over from the board game to PC. I remember many years ago being in a league with an undead team with the board game. What joy i had painlessly painting my figures so they looked ubah against other teams. Then the beauty of technology comes along and i get to play Blood Bowl on my computer oh what joy!! and i must say how bloody cool it is too. Love the commentators in the game Jim the Vampire and Bob the Ogre they really bring a fun element to the game even though i do wish they recorded more voiceovers as they can get a bit repetative which does get annoying.. Other annoying thing is the Ref he does like to send players off the field even with a bribe.. Why?? i only stood on his head!! :P All in all if you love the fantasty element and warhammer style universe and want to enjoy it in a sport styled enviroment then this game is for you!!! you dont really need to know anything about american football or rubgy just remember the following:- Kick off, kick the crap out of the oposing team.. pass the ball if you want to or just get it to the oponents end zone to score.. i myself enjoy the fighting and seeing how many kills my Murdering Hillbilly Team can do in a course of a match :P10/10			"

												Even though I'm not much into american football, this is pretty straight forward. Beat the sh*t out of the other team and try to stop them from scoring a touchdown. The more violence - the better. Nothing like breaking the bones of the enemy player and making him sit out rest of the match or injure him permanently that will affect him for the rest of the career. With good luck, you can even injure the players fatally which will impact hugely on the team's wallet and future gameplays.Only rule is to not beat the unconscious players lying on ground or use weapons... Though you can always try bribing the judges if get caught! In turn based mode the suspense get's pretty high and I really like pimping out my players with more skills and mutations. I just gave my minotaur a third arm to help him catch and throw ball better - and second head to let him see better and dodge more efficiently! ""Here comes the freak show!""			"

Blood Bowl lets you move to multi player and begin playing others.  It has a good system for multiplayer to learn more advanced game theory beyond what the AI can teach you.  It also gives you a chance to begin play in leagues and develop longer term and more developed teams.  I love this game and expect to for a long time.			"

												Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition isn't much different from the Legendary Edition, though I understand most people recommend buying Chaos Edition if you haven't purchased either. They have some extra races included.Blood Bowl is Games Workshop's blend of American Football and Rugby, and is a faithful recreation of the tabletop boardgame. Pick a race, recruit players, and have them all killed on the field by Chaos Dwarves during your first game.BB is arbitrary, with good strategy only able to minimize the punishing dice rolls. Embrace the chaotic nature of your plans going awry, your Catcher with Sure Hands, Nerves of Steel, and Block dying at the hands of a zombie because you rolled 3 skulls and have no team re-rolls left, and watching a Gutter Runner go nearly the length of the entire field to score.Because if you're lucky, you'll catch that little rat on the next play and break his neck, ending his career forever.Not for the faint of heart or those who care that the dice are brutal and don't care about you.For: people who enjoy NFL Blitz, watching Orcs beat down hapless Wood Elves, and anyone who can handle losing because the dice didn't go your way. Lots of fun.			"

												If you, like me, are totally new even to the board game Blood Bowl, this might be a tricky one. There's alot of rules to consider, and the tutorial, while enjoyably short, doesn't give you anything else except the most basic parts. Going from that into the regular game is quite a challenge.That being said, as a digital tactical board game, this one is really good. I've been considering this or BB2 for a while, and eventually decided to pick this one up on sale. If you're really new to this kind of game or specifically Blood Bowl, that might be the way to go, since poor understanding how the game plays out will see you soundly beaten in the beginning. It will take a couple of hours just to get the understanding needed to actually achieve something, and if you're new to this and don't have that kind of patience, this might be something to let go.However, once the bits and pieces come together, it actually makes alot of sense, and the game plays out really well. There's some RNG involved since alot of actions, tackles, passes etc are made with dice, but there's nothing unexpected here, wich means that if you have a better than average chance of success, you're more likely to succeed than not. Of course, messing up and ending up completely trust the dice rolls, you're going to get into trouble, but as long as you have a valid tactic and execute, you have a good chance of winning games.Tactics is very important, and shouldn't be underestimated, and you'd do well to choose your lineup depending on your preferred playing style. If you want to go physical, don't pick light and fast units f.x, and if you want to play a passing game (wich really can be beautiful), pick a line for that with quick units that are good throwers and recievers. Even more important: if you realize you're better at another tactic than the one you actually prefer, run with what you're good at. I'd like to play a long passing game f.x, but I'm appearently most proficient with a tackle/running game, so that's what I'm going with.All in all, if you have the patience to get into the game, this will give you alot of good gaming time. For a tactical board gamer I'd say this is a good pick, if you on top of that is a fan of Warhammer 40k this should be a must-have. Highly recommended.			"

												Forget what you know about strategy games. This game takes it to the next level. If the concept itself isn't cool enough for you, the gameplay will hook you and drag you in. It has a certain depth to it that I can't really explain; you always have options on how you can approach a play. You can risk it, fail and punch your computer screen. Or play it safe.... fail and punch your screen even harder. Each of the different races also change up the gameplay significantly, for example, my favourite team: ""The skaven"" are very good at dodging tackles and running down the field, encouraging a more risky playstyle. Whereas the Dwarves are good at attacking the enemy players. The team ""levels up"" by recruiting more players, improving those players' abilities and getting more services for the squad. Finally, multiplayer is super fun and you can lose ALL your friends by suceeding at SEVEN 6+ DICE ROLLS IN A ROW YOU LUCKY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!Overall, I'd give it a 9/10It would be a 10 but the RNG.... it just gets to you sometimes.(Also there is a Mobile version that's slightly cut down but basically the same thing, it's nice for car journeys)			"

Its has alot of races because there are alot if diffrent play styles. If you don't play a team to its strengths then you will lose. Is it just like the TT version? No not really but there are few things in common with it.In all a good game and solid buy (even more so on sale).			"

The game is about RISK MANAGEMENT, forcing your opponent to take the risks and then punching the crap out of them when they pushed their luck and dropped the ball...This game is really good fun once you understand blocking, setting up players in key positions and protecting the ball when you have it.. the tutorial is crap watch 2 or 3 games on you tube instead then trash the other team with a smile on your face..

												There is no game like this game. It's freaking awesome! It does have some mistakes and bugs (come on Cyanide it can't be that difficult to fix some bugs) BUT... it's the ultimate board game ever!  Play it first against the AI, then against people on-line and after... Join a tournament online to explore the total awesomeness of this masterpiece!			"

												Having played the beta of the original Blood Bowl when it first came out, I wasn't massively impressed with it, and left it a long time before considering again. When the Chaos edition went on sale for £5, I spent a while trying to decide whether it was worth the gamble, and it turns out it was.First things first, it's important to note that this is a dice-based game, so there are going to be stretches where you get a run of bad rolls and lose to teams you should beat, players die from tripping over their own feet and falling over, and you can't pass the ball three yards under no pressure whatsoever.Once you're past the luck-based side of things, this is a pretty faithful rendition of the Blood Bowl boardgame, albeit without the need for a mountain of paper and three hours to finish a match.Each side has their own strengths and weaknesses (although team balance is a little screwy - there's not much reason to choose outside of 5 or so teams of the 20+ available, that's Games Workshop's error, not Cyanide who developed the videogame version), and there should be a side to suit most playstyles, from 'pass it around' to 'kill the other guys, we'll worry about the ball later'.Overall, it's not going to blow anyone away, but if you're looking for a nice sports game with a twist, or you like the concept of Blood Bowl but don't have/want to spend all afternoon shuffling bits of paper, this could be a good buy.

												Stomped a player on the ground and got ejected from the game... 10/10Alot of people say this game is all about luck and rage alot in so many reviews but I brought it anyway and I am glad that I did.Its great fun to play!!I lost so many matches at first until I watched some games on twitch and realised the game is not about taking chances and taking risks... The game is about RISK MANAGEMENT, forcing your opponent to take the risks and then punching the crap out of them when they pushed their luck and dropped the ball...This game is really good fun once you understand blocking, setting up players in key positions and protecting the ball when you have it.. the tutorial is crap watch 2 or 3 games on you tube instead then trash the other team with a smile on your face..

												These devs have released a lot of new editions with very minor differences in the 4-5 years leading up to Chaos Edition and got on my nerves, but I'm willing to forgive them for it because Blood Bowl is a great game. If you like American football with slightly less violence, this game is a lot of fun. Strategy reigns supreme, you need to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the various teams and take advantage of them. For example, the Elve teams tend to be great at running and throwing the ball, able to easily and quickly score touchdowns if allowed to remain on their feet, while races like the Dwarves take the slow and steady approach to (literally) steamrolling enemy teams as they make a group push towards the end zone. Killing the enemy team outright is a viable option and some races such as Chaos and the Orcs depend on incapacitating the enemy team to make up for a lack of a strong passing or high defenses like the Dwarves. The dice gods, as always in Games Workshop properties, ultimately reign supreme in Blood Bowl. The best laid plans can still go all wrong, and that is part of the fun because it will happen to your opponents as often as it happens to you. There ARE steps you can take to minimize the impact of the random number generator though, in the form of bribes to the referees, wizards in the audience, etc... In terms of game modes you have a full season Campaign, in which the goal is to win enough regulation games to take part in large tournaments. Over the course of this mode you will draft new players and watch existing ones become better at the game, managing team finances and the players in a meta-game in between actual matches. Also ready for your enjoyment are one-shot tournaments organized by yourself in Competition mode, one-shot games called Exhibition Matches, a Tutorial for new players, and a Story Mode which has you playing with various famous teams over the course of a career as a coach. Lots to do, for sure, and if you like multiplayer there are still many active players online in the matchmaking service. Even if there wasn't though, you could still play over LAN using Hamachi or local hotseat.Overall I do recommend the game, and I hope when Blood Bowl 2[www.bloodbowl-game.com] comes out they attempt to keep it contained to fewer iterations. I doubt they will though based on the last run... The good news is that Chaos Edition is the final version of this run, so if you see it on sale and you like turn based strategy games with a lot of over-the-top sports humor thrown in, you can't go wrong with Chaos Edition. It feature local hot seat play, so even if people stop playing it online you can still play it with your friends in your own home a lot cheaper than you could by buying the actual board game.			"

												Still clunky in some areas, over all this game does a fantast job of translating the board game to the computer. It's a turn based strategy game that combines aspects of American Football & Rugby and is set in the Warhamer Fantasy setting. It is a whole ton of fun, and can be played alone against the AI or with friends in online leagues. Over all, I give it 4 out of 5 Mithril Spikes.			"

												If you liked the tabletop game, then you might well enjoy this. It has all the teams you ever knew, and some you may have missed. You can play with the rules you're familiar with (or try alternative modes of play). Can play against AI that isn't totally bereft of ability nor relies on fudged dice. Could always join an online league to go against other actual human players. Rather spiffing. I'm not sure how intuitive it would be to someone that hadn't learnt the game on the tabletop though, I suspect the range of available skills might be overwhelming and confusing, could download the free rulebook as reference to offset such issues.

												This is a hard game to recommend to anyone.  Every time I start describing the experience of carefully selecting a team, training them, picking a sponsor and selecting your per-game bribes people get excited.  Then people hear that in every match there's a chance that your entire team will be injured or killed after gaining valuable experience points.  People's eyes tend to glaze over at this point.It's the violence and death that make the multiplayer and campaign so good.  You know that every match will be brutal and chance as much as skill will turn the tide of victory.  Seeing the crowd turn on your opponent to tear them to shreds on a bad play or watching your own blocker critically fail a roll and bounce off the other teams ball carrier like the dude is made of force fields are just flipsides of the same coin.You can be good at this game or bad.  Awesome or terrible.  In the end this game is like all true Games Workshop titles.  Skill is irrelevant.  The fun is in the stories you get to tell later about the crazy stuff that happened on the dice rolls and how they played out.  Play it with friends or enemies or the exceptionally active Blood Bowl community on Steam if you like, but understand that winning and losing aren't super important.  It's all about how the game plays you.			"

It's definitely a game about minimizing your chances at failing, it's part of the strategy and you can use it against your opponents.Personally, I like playing the Ogre team. They don't seem like a serious team, but fielding 6 big guys really puts the hurt on the enemy team. Every injury is like an extra point in my book.			"

												A great port of the popular and well-received turn-based strategy board game which uses the newest LRB 6 edition of the rules. Blood Bowl (BB) is the game of Fantasy Football, akin to real-life Rugby (play only halts when a point is scored) or American Football, only with excessive violence, death, secret weapons and even magic. Oh, and the ball has spikes on it. The players who form the 23 types of team to choose from come from a range of classic fantasy races: Elves, Dwarves, Undead, Orcs - they're all there. Each has its own play style, so I would advise you try a variety to find ones that suit you (for me, it's Wood Elves especially, with their incredible Wardancers). Races not for beginners: Chaos, Goblin, Halfling, Khemri, Nurgle, Ogre and Vampire.Be aware: this game is based on dice-rolling, so luck plays a part. BUT there is also lots of strategy to it, from more basic ideas like risk management and positioning, to the more complex such as chainpushing and team builds/management/development (useful site - http://bbtactics.com/). 90% of the few hundred games I've played have felt like the better player won. Sometimes bad luck really does strike yes, but if you analyse your game-play you usually could've made some better decisions, too. Don't be put off by what seems like bad luck in your first few games, but be warned that this game requires some patience to get good at.  Online leagues are where this game really comes to life. The AI seems hard at first, but can become too easy quite quickly. Online you get the challenge of real players, can choose options such turn length (I would highly recommend 2 minute turns) and even make your own league! 'Naggaroth Open' league is great for matchmaking, as it has a very good community, but it's probably a good idea to start off in Auld World (once you can regularly beat the AI on 'Medium'). There are a couple of rare, minor bugs in online play (the '12-player' and the infamous 'invisible player' bug), but these are not game-breaking, and most community-run leagues have agreements about ways to get around it. Some of my best gaming experiences have been in Blood Bowl. The chaos, fun and replayablity is huge. It's just great.			"

												Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition is a faithful reproduction of the board game. You have all the rules and teams and a big community that enjoys the game.While it did take Cyanide quite some time to fix all the bugs, it is now running pretty well and stable for years.The game itself centers around getting the ball into the enemies endzone to score a touchdown. How you do this is up to you and the different fantasy-races usually employ different methods of doing so. The woodelves dance around their enemies with grace, while teams like chaos prefer to beat their opponents into a pulp first and then worry about the ball.Rulewise it is a game about risk-management. Many actions carry a risk of failure and if something goes wrong your turn ends. So you must plan your turn in advance and start with actions that carry no or a low risk, But a bad roll of the die can still screw your plans which is just part of playing Blood Bowl. A good ""trainer"" knows that those failures will happen and patiently waits for his fortune to reverse. Still, it's a very tactical game overall and it is very satisfying to see your plans work like clockwork !No game is perfect however, so there are some cons:- To really understand the game you should try to find the rulebook online. The provided manual does not provide much help. Doesn't apply if your already a fan of the board-game, but will be a hurdle for new players.- The UI could be better and you could get better information about the chance of success for your actions. Again mostly a problem for people who don't know the rules well.- The options to modify your teams appearence are very limited. You can pick a color a symbol and choose between a very limited set of skins/models for your players. In the actual game however it makes little to no difference so it's not a big deal.- The AI may seem strong at first but you quikly learn how to beat it no matter the odds and the difficulty settings. It's good enough to train against but the real fun is playing against other people. The singleplayer can still be enjoyed for a long while... constantly winning has an appeal of it's own ;)- While the AI-commentators do have a quite an array of comments it doesn't take that long until it gets boring. Thankfully you can turn them off once you've reached that point. Same goes for the touchdown animations, but hey, you only see these if someone scores a touchdown which isn't that often anyways... and as long as you made that point you wont care.Now don't let these cons get in your way of having a good time with this game. It's really worth it in my opinion, it just wouldn't be fair to not mention them.So, what are you waiting for ? Get a team together and have a go at the trophy.It's a show of skill, of might, it's entertaining... it is BLOOD BOWL !			"

												Blood Bowl is a classic board game that made it onto the PC. A lot of fun and just evil to the bone.Smash or even try to kill your opponents player - since a touchdown doesn't have to be scored in the beginning. If the other team no longer has players on the field, you just walk to the finish line.The PC game has everything the original board game has to offer and with the possibility to play against opponent around the world, its so easy to play games. It has a little bit of randomness and luck in it, since you roll dice to play, but a good tactic and the right decisions is almost as equally important.Choose your team from all the Warhammer nations and groups and use their advantages against your enemies.Frustration can happen since even your starplayer, you build up in many games, can eventually die, but that's just how Blood Bowl works and why its not called Candy World or Sugar Bowl.As the only two negative points (from my point of view) are:- the high price of the game (but worth it)- time consuming of it, since one game goes at least 40min and there are no savepoint during a gameI still play the board game, but the PC version is as fun and great as well			"

												A great game, pretty much a straight translation of the tabletop rules. A great way to play Bloodbowl with friends that live far away. Do note however, that it is a dice game, with all the pros and cons of one. You can play a perfect game, be a master at tactics, but if the dice hate you, you can do diddly squat about it! If you take this game too seriously you will soon become frustrated by it, in the end it is best played casually between friends.Online leagues is where it is at and there are not too many people online at the moment, I suggest getting the game with a couple of friends and playing it when you all have time to. Also, buy re-rolls when making a team, ALL THE RE-ROLLS!			"

												Great game of Blood Bowl.  Has all the teams of the table top and a few more.  Ive been playing Blood bowl since the early 90's and this version is better than the table top.  Works amazing with the Steam Controller.  Solo campaign is very easy, with most hitting teams a lot more challenging with finese teams.  Multi player has good action online and is a lot of fun.  Great team advancement and player development with skills improving player performance and is true to the table top original.  Inducements keep the playing field level and allow weaker teams to stand a chance against tougher competition.  Focus knocked it out of the park bringing this table top classic with its Cult following to a whole new generation of players.			"

												What i dont get is theres a ""new"" Madden or FIFA each year but if you like some clobbering on top of your managing this is pretty much the only option except for some crappy Speedball remake.And its a good option, however this is no normal sports game in a sense but a boardgame and so.... a) The success or failure of every action a player performs is determined by a dice roll which probably (maybe possibly) isnt weighted against you but sure as hell feels like it is.b) Starting out you lack all the hard counters which could soften the impact of yet another failed roll - the opposition doesntc) The tutorial isnt that helpful so you lack info on how to soften the impact of yet another failed roll or how to prevent themIn conclusion a+b+c= Your ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥boiling and the neighbors calling the police to detain the gibbering screeching loon next door because someone failed to pick up a ball three times and then died walking a step too much all the while the opposition who is PROBABLY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD DAMN PRANCY ELVES HURT THEM HURT THEM HURT THEM KILL KILL KILL MURDER MAIM ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ GOD DAMN SHUT UP ♥♥♥♥ YOUR RNG♥♥♥♥♥♥ALT+F4Yet it is still fun somehow (must be a roguelike thing), butthe longer you play and actually win stuff the more it turns out the manager part isnt that indepth.Hiring and firing players (no possibility to mix races, also they pretty much are all the same and theres a set limit on types which can be deployed - no all-bruiser teams for example), purchasing some temporary boosters or other stuff which is in essence a chance at a reroll, thats about it. Players can level up and you can select skills or stat boosts - theres actually somewhat many but level ups are slow and a few skills are absolutely essential for the role a player is supposed to fill so youll prolly always wanna chose those.   Theres a ""Blitz"" mode which has some more stuff along the same lines along with buying equipment which is expensive, temporary and on top of that provides benefits only at a random chance around 20%  and in classic mode the player would gain the visual upgrade on a level up (without the bonus, not sure). Also you have to chose a sponsor and if you dont fullfill certain criteria they take all your money at the end of a season because thats how this works (?!?). Play classic.Theres ""live"" commentary which inevitably gets old after a while.Still a very fun game despite or more likely because of the random element..oh heh RNG dicked you over again. Roll 1D6 vs Tantrum or break 1D6 objects in a one square radius.			"

												Beneath a somewhat overly complicated veneer lies one of deepest competitive turn-based games around. Blood Bowl really shines while matching wits with other players head-to-head, as a simple roll of the dice can lead to breathtakingly spectacular plays. Blood Bowl has spawned volumes of analysis and commentary across the web, and it's the elegant marriage between its teams, players, and skill systems that keeps me coming back for more. The rich fantasy world that Games Workshop has developed over the years is just icing on the grog-soaked cake.			"

												10/10 buy it, if you're ready to learn it.Now a bit longer:I used to play this game a lot back in a while, but stopped it, and now bought it on steam sale. It is a hardcore strategy: it's unforgiving, ugly, and you do need to learn quite a lot. Yes, the graphics aren't that great, yes, there is a big randomness factor for a hardcore turn based strategy, and yes, some races are extremly below the curve. But man, this game is rewarding as hell.Once you get to the point, where you undestand basci tactics, and concepts, you can start playing the really interesting teams. The game itself has an incredible variety just from the tactics available. Add the 25 race, the leveling system, for each player individually, multi player, tournaments, single player campaign, and you can easily put in 100 hours into this game, if you ever get bored.If you don't have any other Blood Bowl game, I recommend starting here. Buying the 2nd, is a waste of money, that game doesn't deserve to be called Blood Bowl. Buying the Legendary and saving 10 euros is something, but the three races are well worth it, believe me.For learning, I recommend cKnoor's youtube channel, he made some tutorials for beginners, and has a lot of gameplay uploaded, you can learn a lot from him. He also streams on twitch, if I remember right.If you need help with starting the game, I am more then happy to teach you the basics of the game, and some of the more beginner friendly races. So feel free to write me a p.m., but don't expect me up anytime soon, I have a social life to live after all, I can't spend every minute hitting people into the ground with a team of mummies and skeletons :DD			"

												Blood Bowl is a wonderful game filled with pain, suffering, and anguish for both your poor little meat bag pawns and yourself, as the dark god Nuffle makes your well thought out stategic plans crumble into ashen dust before your eyes as your freinds watch on, giggling at the shaudenfraidah like the cackling harpies they are! In all seriousness, blood bowl is a game of maximizing your odds of success against an oh so cruel random number generator with a fairly deep and varried system of mechanics which simulates a hyper violent game of foot ball played out by a bunch of fantasy creatures. Buyer beware though, this game's tutorial sucks♥♥♥♥♥ and if you go into this blind, you will be scratching your head as the game punishes you for blundering around with systems that you dont even know exist. Look up a tutorial or two on youtube and your expirance will be FAR more enjoyable than it otherwise would be.			"

												I appear to be the first negative reviewer to have completed Blood Bowl in its entirety. This game has two distinct parts, the dating and the Bad Boys Love secret match unlocked by romancing every orc possible!!The first part is simply too short to be entertaining. Any match in Blood Bowl can be played in about an hour going at a relaxed pace, but there is significant overlap between matches, including sections that have no effect on the particular match you're playing, so I found myself skipping more and more as I replayed. This also caused me to inadvertently skip content I hadn't dice rolled before, because some sections have multiple outcomes but start out the same way regardless of match. There is no way to go back to content accidentally skipped without reloading or starting a new game and it simply wasn't interesting enough to worth bothering to find out why I was faced with the choice of telling that one cute Orc with the pigtails ""convenience store"" or ""grocery store"" and I could infer it had something to do with pudding anyway.Consequently, there just isn't enough time to give any character depth and there's no challenge to complete a match. By the time you finish a match, you feel like you were merely introduced to the team. Picking matches is also very obvious and there is never any difficulty in seducing the various orcs, unless you can't figure out that picking every opportunity to spend time with your desired orc is necessary to romance them. The matches I enjoyed most against Bonecrusher, Fister, and Anghel, stood out because they were simply the most oddball. For a game that is billed as an orc romance game, most matches utilize stereotypical melodrama. Orc puns and poop culture references abound, but there's really nothing laugh out loud funny in Blood Bowl and at best you'll smirk a lot. All in all, Blood Bowl wasn't an altogether terrible game, but it just wasn't worth the money and I got it in a 50% off sale. I will likely never play it again and would forget about it entirely if Steam didn't keep it in my library forever. As some consolation, the sexy trading cards were surprisingly valuable and I was able to quickly sell them for about $1000.If you don't mind a lot of repetition, love Blood Bowl no matter what, and really love silly gimmicks, then buy this game. Otherwise, pick up just about any other RnG game on Steam. Even some of the free ones are more entertaining than Blood Bowl4/ORC			"

												I'm not going to say that Cyanide's Blood Bowl is a fantastic videogame.  It is, however, arguably the best way to play the board game Blood Bowl over the internet.  Fumbbl, while a wonderful community, is built around an application that experiences server-wide glitches between patches that affect the meta of entire leagues.  I respect people who play on Fumbbl, and in many ways prefer the simple sprite-based interface.  However, Chaos Edition includes a tutorial and single player modes to ease new players into the game.For a time, I refused to purchase any version of Cyanide's Blood Bowl after the barebones 2009 version.  Both 2009 Blood Bowl and Blood Bowl II force changes from the source material into the core game, whereas Legendary and Chaos Edition limit these changes to an alternate mode called ""Blitz.""Something to always keep in mind is that Cyanide's Blood Bowl is not an original game, but an adaptation.  Chaos Edition is the most accurate and accessible verion of the board game.Edit: It is worth noting that Legendary Edition is functionally the same, save for the new playable races, and I believe it can even play with Chaos Edition players.  So, if you main a race included in Legendary Edition, you might be able to get by with a cheaper purchase.  Additionally, the inclusion of Khorne Demons without something closer to base/accepted game like the Slann is a little disappointing.  However, that disappointment pales in comparison to the inclusion of Bretonnia in Blood Bowl II before the addition of staple teams like Undead and Nurgle.  Granted, both Bretonnia and Khorne Demons seem well balanced/tested and were adapted (with liberties) from a certain Fumbbl format.			"

												I appear to be the first negative reviewer to have completed Blood Bowl in its entirety. This game has two distinct parts, the dating and the Bad Boys Love secret match unlocked by romancing every orc possible!!The first part is simply too short to be entertaining. Any match in Blood Bowl can be played in about an hour going at a relaxed pace, but there is significant overlap between matches, including sections that have no effect on the particular match you're playing, so I found myself skipping more and more as I replayed. This also caused me to inadvertently skip content I hadn't dice rolled before, because some sections have multiple outcomes but start out the same way regardless of match. There is no way to go back to content accidentally skipped without reloading or starting a new game and it simply wasn't interesting enough to worth bothering to find out why I was faced with the choice of telling that one cute Orc with the pigtails ""convenience store"" or ""grocery store"" and I could infer it had something to do with pudding anyway.Consequently, there just isn't enough time to give any character depth and there's no challenge to complete a match. By the time you finish a match, you feel like you were merely introduced to the team. Picking matches is also very obvious and there is never any difficulty in seducing the various orcs, unless you can't figure out that picking every opportunity to spend time with your desired orc is necessary to romance them. The matches I enjoyed most against Bonecrusher, Fister, and Anghel, stood out because they were simply the most oddball. For a game that is billed as an orc romance game, most matches utilize stereotypical melodrama. Orc puns and poop culture references abound, but there's really nothing laugh out loud funny in Blood Bowl and at best you'll smirk a lot. All in all, Blood Bowl wasn't an altogether terrible game, but it just wasn't worth the money and I got it in a 50% off sale. I will likely never play it again and would forget about it entirely if Steam didn't keep it in my library forever. As some consolation, the sexy trading cards were surprisingly valuable and I was able to quickly sell them for about $1000.If you don't mind a lot of repetition, love Blood Bowl no matter what, and really love silly gimmicks, then buy this game. Otherwise, pick up just about any other RnG game on Steam. Even some of the free ones are more entertaining than Blood Bowl4/ORC			"

												So... Blood Bowl. This is gonna be a weird review for me - since I'm on one hand going to praise it to heaven, and on the other, slam the developer for being bad.About the game: Blood bowl is a turn-based mix between chess, american football and warhammer fantasy. You get over 20 races to pick from, with different players, each with their own stats and starting abilities. A lot of the game is based on dice-rolls, with modifiers, so that you can 'control' the risks you take with each dice roll. And it is a risk each time. Because failing the roll can often end your turn.So, the good part: The game feels awesome, the wealth of different races, abilities, etc. are great, the rules are well-fleshed out, and some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that can happen, if you are lucky enough, is amazing (If a bit infuriating for the one losing because of it). What I'm saying is, basically: The boardgame is AMAZING, and the idea of having a digital version, that does all the dice-rolls and remembers all the rules about dodging, throwing, catching, blocking, etc. for you, is nice.Now for the bad part: Cyanide, the developer.Basically, this game is just not well made. You'll constantly ask yourself what the hell went through the developers mind when they made it like this. All the parts that is the game itself is brilliant, since it's a straight copy of the boardgame, but stuff like the interface, the online lobby system, the terrible path-finding, the few bugs, graphical choices, there's so many times when you just don't understand why they made it like they did.Conclusion: I still love this game to death. Cyanide didn't ♥♥♥♥ up enough that I don't love it. There's luckily not that many bugs left, and the game itself functions well enough. You'll just have to get past the stupid design decisions first.TL:DR This game is awesome, if you love Turn Based Strategy, Warhammer, and violent sports. Developer is a Piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Fun game, though I swear the dice are totally rigged at times.There is one issue that kind of robbed it of some enjoyment for me. When your team matches up against another team, if your team has better stats than the other then the other team gets X amount of gold to spend for free to try and makeup for the imbalance. I feel that robs the entire idea of an experience and levelling system of its point. Also the AI primarily uses the money to buy star players so game after game you end up seeing the same faces of the same star players even though you killed them a few games back.			"

												This game is simply amazing. If you like strategy games then this is certainly for you. It is also a game for you if you enjoy killing people. The dice-based system is... Well... Dicey, but that is to be expected (TRIPLE 1!) and is how the game should be when dice-based, makes you happy when you roll good but sad when you roll bad.. The offline play is ok, and the games are faster than online, but the ai is extra limited compared to a human mind, and it is always more rewarding to go against a real human. The gameplay works well but Cyanide have made some things... Cyanide... But overall a great game and I recommend it fully. Also, Halfings may be the best team ever if you play. Just putting that into your head for you. They're amazing.			"

												Focus home interactive are complete morons unable to do a single thing right. However they still couldn't completely destroy the spirit of bloodbowl. This game isn't entirely as fun as it could've been with version 3 of the rules, but the version 4 version makes the game play faster ; ideal for the computer. Beats having to remember and calculate stuff when playing the board game version. Version 4 of the rules means strength has the advantage over agility though, making it not as well balanced as it could've been. Nevertheless. It's a good game. Just turn off the music and comentary once you've heard all stuff it has to say (in like 5 minutes).			"

Any other gamers will probably won't get this game), but ... IT IS BUGGY AS HELL. It is loaded with game breaking bugs.--> you can't place all players when using custom formations (and the predefined formations SUCK)-->The game continiously crashes when running it while having antivirus protection activated-->sometimes the game just hangs in mid-animation of the enemy, whithout actualy crashing, forcing you to abort the game since nothing is happening anymoreThese bugs are highly frustrating, especially since they were known since the beginning but were never fixed (AND NEVER WILL BE)Do NOT buy!Selling such a buggy game and never bothering to fix anything should be considered a scam			"

												Blood Bowl is a stripped down version of football managers everywhere. Which is completely fine for what is it. A smash with your lizard jaws your opponent's team or deftly dodge the grubb dwarf hands game.You manage a team and lead them to glory in two campaign modes, your typical single player experience or the be-kidnapped-by-teams/play-as-coach-basis, with the former having two modes in themselves which limits your time limit or lets you have a more leisurely pace. The AI in this game isn't great, which is why the true game lies in not the game itself but the human players. Tournaments are great avenues of fun.Pros & ConsPros:This game for its time and the general anesthetic of the game has great graphics. The players are detailed enough and the brawls are great fun to watch but albeit it all gets stale when you watch if for the 100th hour. Doesn't all repetitive motion get like that? You shouldn't be paying that close attention to detail when you are praying for your dice throw however.Cons:This game...has a steep learning curve the size of Mt. Everest. This is taking it kindly. My recommendation is to not play or at least don't get comfortable with the game AI. It teaches you bad habits, and takes stupid risks to fullfill your ego, which paradoxically due to the way the AI cheats medium is the easiest difficulty. Or at least those stupid moves to be ego increasing for the sole purpose to later realize it was all a lie in multiplayer. The game is essentially a giant game of risk management with your dice and your players. To which humans seem alot more intuitive at, than AI so far.Overall, if you have patience, and enjoy a management game that is more dice rolling and strategic chess with a side of gore. This is your game. "

												If you really like the original board/miniature game... don't buy this, its just too frustrating.  Too many bugs (some of which have been there since the very first release), too many missing things (star players, inducements, even a couple of teams) and generally bad involvement from the company/companies behind it.If you've wanted to play BB before but not had the chance, and this comes up VERY cheap in a sale, then maybe consider it, just to get a brief introduction to the game... before heading over to FUMBBL to play it better, or buying an actual team of minis and playing it on the tabletop where it works best :-)Update: also, there will be a(nother) new version of this game coming out next year, supposedly early in the year, so definitely don't waste your money on this in the meantime.

												I looked up a few things on Bloodbowl, now that I've gotten the game, and people say the dice  are perfectly fair, they just seem not to be because we don't pay attention to the victories.Bull.  On multiple occasions I've had the 'you hit the dirt face-first"" roll four times in a row--a 1296-to-one chance.  On a normal randomization, this wouldn't happen once until you've played for months; I've only had it a few days.There are very few things more stressful than putting together a good plan, thinking on my feet as circumstances change, accounting for my team's strengths and weaknesses--and my opponents'--preparing for setbacks, spending money for rerolls just in case...  and then watching the opponents plow through my defenses with disgustingly high rolls to undo all my work in a manner that's statistically impossible.  One of those few things is to have that happen, come up with a backup plan, set it in action--and watch the dice roller give it to me dry over and over and over again so that a team that should have  steamrolled up the field ends up tripping over its shoelaces.Screw this game--if you haven't bought it yet; don't.

												Blood Bowl manages to take everything that was great about the tabletop game and books, and remove it. What Games Workshop has left is arbitrary dice rolling, which has even been dilluted to the point where the player cannot see the dice unless certain circumstances apply, and long waits for opponents.  If one is looking for an initial indicator of game quality, the tutorial is usually an excellent place to start. Blood Bowl takes enough time to get in a little of the flavor of the world in which it is built, but decides to leave out little details like rules beyond the basics one might expect from a primer on American Football for 3 year olds, (Ball goes in the end zone, tackling players good, getting injured bad) while blatantly telling the player that if they want to know more, they should look it up.   One might accept that story mode is in fact the true tutorial, since the first mission is simply to finish a game, regardless of win or loss, as though testing a players patience for the slow, laborious plodding of the computer. While the second mission is to throw 2 goblins, with no instructions on how to do so. It becomes more frustrating once you find out how to do so, since in order to accomplish this seemingly simple task, a player must actually overcome 2 phantom dice rolls in addition to simply having the necessary pieces available.  Ultimately Blood Bowl takes what promised to be an exciting, comedic romp through a well established and lore filled world, and turn it into a distillation of the worst elements of a table top miniatures game with poor camera angles and repetetive dialouge.

												i love the idea of this game, im not a sports game kinda guy, but a game where you can murder and maim your opponent on the field, count me in. problem is.. * the dice is in no way fair, when i only fail on a 1, i get nothing but ones, when the oponent only succeeds on a 6 it gets nothing but sixes.* i hate to see dwarfs jumping in and out of tackle zones like they where god damn acrobats, but my elves who have high agi gets pummeled to the ground if they decide to disengage or pick up the ball.* 8 out of 10 times if i use a re roll i get the exact same result, be that if i have 1 or 3 dices to knock someone out.* take cheerleaders and assistant coaches, and it helps nothing, but the AI gets all the great results.* your players will often be ripped apart, and get no SPP (star player points = xp) but the oponent will harvest points like there is no tomorrowand mind you... this is on easy difficulty. I mean, the game is kinda fun, and when you start to get your team up there, its cool, but its just too unfair, which often means youll probably say screw this.ive lost my most valued player, with 6 Spp to a measly goblin with no spp, which means if you dont get lucky on the apothicary roll, that player is gone, if you dont reload the entire match and hope for something better.play Dwarves, and you will win, they are unbelievably tough and though low agi, they get more lucky on agi rolls than Agi heavy teamsi dont recommend it, spite the fact i often play a match or two, because its way too unfair and too random in favor of the AI			"

												One of my favorite games, I am an avid wargamer on the tabletop, and anything digital with a GW sticker on it is no guarentee of quality, yet this is a very well exectuted and brilliantly faithful addaptaion of the tabletop game.The game has a steep learning curve and the first few games i played were bloody painful, and yet now that i have got used to the ""♥♥♥♥ you"" style of gameplay it can be very enjoyable. I think one thing you have to bear in mind with this game at all times is that this is a literal copy of the games rules, so the core mechanic is a 6 sided dice, which are known for being fickle things, and can lead to some very frustration rolls and outcomes (4 1's ""attacking player falls"" in a row is my personal record. One critisism i think goes without saying for this game is the commentery. They really need a LOT mrore lines of dialogue, as it did not take me long to turn off all sound exept in game sounds (collisions, blocks and crowd) and just whacking some music on in the background.So overall a great game, looking very forward to the sequel			"

												WARNING: This is a recreation of a BOARD GAME. You will NOT be playing FOOTBALL. If you were expecting action like the old NFL Bltiz then keep on moving. This is a turn based football game. I'm sure its an excellent recreation of the board game, but they cleverly hide that fact in the video and descriptions. In fact, the only place you can discover that its a board game is in the ""popular user-defined tags"". I believe this was intentional because who actually wants to play a turn based football boardgame on the PC.Maybe, just maybe, I could see this being fun on a table top with minitures. But even then, the rules defined to make this game work just dont meet my expectation for a fun, exciting sporting event.This game is just a big NO from me. If you've played the board game, and enjoyed it, i'm sure this is a fine recreation. If you want a football game to be 1 character performing actions to dice rolls based on static positioning, then you may enjoy this game too. If you think football isn't already a long game, and wish it could be dragged out into the longest possible way, then this game is for you.For everyone else, think twice before buying this game; seriously!

												If you like jokes that go stale after one match, no variation, repeating the same things constantly, feeling cheated, feeling that the ""random"" roles really aren't all that random, having control only over the race and team uniforms clothes, and basically a choice in maps that have absolutely no bearing on gameplay whatsoever; Well then! This is the perfect game for you.... just don't waste your money on this garbage. Strategy has been completely reduced to pure luck. This game really feels like it is based solely on chance. Oh, and gaining levels and the amount of hours to get even decent stats is not worth the grind. I'd rather play FF Tactics....WHERE""S MY REMAKE Square!!!!			"

												Be ready that achievments will not work for that game and it looks like they will not repair that bug. But still, it is an intresting game concept and if you did not play first game of that studio, which called ""Chaos League'. Sad but true - first game was better, it had a diffrent playing styles depended on race, here things are more trivial. Otherwise, if you are a big fan of a board game, it is a good choice for you. Moreover, this game has a good graphics, good sound and many funny geek-jokes. And what is really important - no real concurents for that game, so if you want to try insane american football without almost any rules - buy it.p.s. If you are from Russia, it will cost you only 3 dollars, why not?			"

												I enjoy this game. Its a decent game to play if you enjoy foot ball and warhammer. (not to mention that GamesWorkshop no longer makes this game) The game itself is simple yet very diffecult. The designers did there homework extreamly well. ou deffently get a feel for how the races play on the GamesWorkshop table tob game Wahmmer. The anouncers are amusing but get aggrivating after awhile of saying the same thing. the game play is alot of fun and i will agree that the RNG  seems alittle off when it comes to your larger character (ogers and menitars with ""thick skill, wild animal, and loner"") for if you fail one of there tests and you spend a re-roll to try and get them to move they will still fail. which has cost me a few games. But all in all a very enjoyable game.			"

Blood Bowl isn't for everyone, but if it's for you, you'll be completely sucked in by it. It's a turn based sports strategy game with a dark fantasy theme and an RPG leveling system. If you're still with me after that little description, then maybe Blood Bowl is for you.You start the game by selecting a team of bloodthirsty monsters from the Warhammer universe. Each race plays a little differently. The Orcs want to bash their opponents into the dirt. The Elves want to dodge around and make big passing plays. The Goblins have a bunch of dirty tricks up their sleeves. You choose your name, logo and colour and then you begin.The first time I played, I got completely thrashed by the computer. There is a learning curve present but there are plenty of guides online and a big community of players who can give you some pointers. Leveling up your guys in the right way is a big part of the game. Some skills like Block and Dodge are a must, other skills like Pass block are only used in specific circumstances and best saved for later.The sound is satisfying. The commentators are hilarious. I though the graphics were fine. It's an older game from a smaller studio, so I wasn't expecting much. There is a nice variety of units in the game. The Chaos Edition comes with 23 teams and there is plenty of single player content here to play around with if you want to avoid the highly competitive online scene. Some guys have been playing the board game since the 80s and will mop the floor with newer players.I'm loving Blood Bowl so far. Anyways, I've got to get back to trying to take my team ""The New Ork Ragerz"" to the Blood Bowl final.			"

												I owned the board game and played it a bit growing up so I might be biased naturally to this game but I liked it. It's fun, viscerally violent and the campagin mode gives the feeling of progressing you're team throughout a season. Some caveats though. The commentators are funny for ONE game. After that they are repetitive nightmares to listen too. Also, you are guaranteed at some point to scream at the scream that the dice gods failed you. Otherwise well worth buying and playing.			"

												Fun and engaging with so many teams to choose from.This game is a little gem. It's fun, fast and violent in that cozy happy kind of way that only the Warhammer world and Games Workshop can provide.The game is at its best when played in a league with friends (or simply other good-natured people) but it can provide quite a bit of fun even as a single player game providing you do not go for the easiest most hard-hitting teams (in that case the game is too easy).

												It's the start of the second half, and the Wood Elves lead 1-0. The Nurglites kick off, the ball lands right next to the Wood Elf Thrower. The Wardancer takes out one of the Nurglite linesmen, the Thrower winds up for the pass... A perfect pass to a Catcher, now running the ball along the left field line.  He's 10 yards away from the end zone, with a Just As Planned grin on his face...Which suddenly turns into a Not As Planned face when the Beast of Nurgle who's been idling on the opposite side of the field wakes up, slithers over, and blocks the Catcher's path with a bundle of tentacles.10/10, would lose a touchdown again.

												Blood Bowl is a rare case of a tabletop conversion to PC being good because of the great variety of teams and various tactics they offer for any taste.Thankfully because the original/turn-based gameplay by Games Workshop had to be used - it wasn't something talentless Cyanide could ruin. However you should completely avoid real time mode as it is utterly horrible - as with all other Cyanide's creations.Chaos Edition offers you 23 teams and 10 stadiums in total and is completely multiplayer- and save-compatible with the Legendary Edition (you won't get new teams in LE-made leagues however).The former is especially a sound decision as CE, while a great deal for newcomers or even people coming from vanilla BB, isn't a good deal for LE owners at all. With only 3 teams and 1 stadium added it simply isn't worth the full price.			"

												6/10: A reasonably fun game of strategy and violent sport. It wins a recommendation because of the diversity of teams in the Chaos Edition, the amusing (for a while, see below) commentary, and the satisfaction you gain from winning.Having never played the tabletop game it is based on I cannot speak on this aspect.However, the negatives I have make this a VERY BORDERLINE RECOMMENDATION. Most everything is won or lost on random dice rolls. The sheer probability balancing and number crunching involved in a truly deep strategy is more than I can be bothered to spend on such a game which still seems largely arbitrary. If you are anything like me you will end up save scumming matches that are especially important. Also, you are liable to end up cursing your time loudly and terribly as they appear to be the most inept incompetent sports players EVER, worse than England football teams in recent World Cup tournaments. Watch as these supposedly trained players, who should have more skill than a comatose amoeba even at the most basic levels, fails at such a simple task as picking up the ball. Which is a Turnover. Fails to catch a pass from a foot away. Turnover. Fails to quite run the distance without stacking it. Turnover. Even I am not that clumsy, and in the end you may well either rage quit or eventually develop a complete loathing and sarcastic relationship of hate with your team.I play it occasionally, when the idea appeals and trumps my memories of actual gameplay. As a concept, it is great. As an experience it is stressful and lacking. I recommend it tentatively because I have enjoyed it on occasion, and you might too.			"

												The game is a strange combination of frustrations. Despite the conveniently undisplayable evidence that the RNG is not biased (which many of the die-hard fans will insist exists anyway without any proof) the game routinely feels as though it is indeed very biased towards the AI dice rolls - even when you're winning and crushing the opposition! I can tell you that, in my experience, playing solo against the AI is a completely different experience compared to playing multiplayer vs a human opponent in terms of RNG fairness. This is why the developers refuse to show you the AI's dice rolls.However, this is all balanced out by the fact that the AI is terrible - I mean so shockingly bad at the game that the developers had to give all the starting teams you face bonuses in order to make them even slightly challenging in solo play. Which they still aren't.I have played it a fair bit largely due to nostalgia and my childhood memories of the table top game I used to love.If you plan to play it solo then be prepared for what ""seems"" like a heavily biased RNG and the subsequent frustrations this causes and learn to live with it like I did. In this mode I don't really recommend the game unless you are a very laid back and patient person.If you plan to play it multiplayer online then you'll probably have a lot more fun. The downside is that you'll have to deal with other internet users though - which is not my cup of tea.			"

												So I'm on the side of people who never played the table top.  Does this seem like a good strategy game? Yea, it seems well thought out and deep.  But sadly I was looking for a bit more spectacle rather than number crunching.  I was taken in more for the them of a tree throwing a halfing carrying a ball into the endzone while being blitzed by a demon and an orc.  Sadly without ample imagination that just isn't this games strength.  If you know you like the board game, by all means grab this and play on.  If you wanted something visceral, move on.			"

												This is fun, and the animations and commentary are amusing at times. There's a host of games and a campaign to play with, where you manage your team across a significant number of cups and tournaments throughout the Old World.However, I very nearly downrated this game because of one thing that drove me nuts throughout my first match. THE GAME DOESN'T TURNOVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE POSSESSION OF THE BALL AND THE OPPOSING TEAM STILL HAS POSSESSION OF THE BALL! I don't know if this is a new rule Games Workshop cooked up in their laboratory, but it's outrageously stupid and confusing because the game can turnover for reasons that can't be seen or explained. The only reason I could see for the turnover was because someone got KO'd, but again, THAT'S NOT A REASON TO TURNOVER! Indeed, this has greatly infuriated me!I should downrate this game, but there are hours of enjoyment even if you're not a fan of American handegg, or Games Workshop.			"

First of all, when rolling for Wild Animal, you succeed on 2+ when Blocking or Blitzing, not 4+. Secondly, with AG3 you succeed on 3+ when Dodging into 0 TZ and away from an opponent with no negative modifiers - the same goes for AG4; you succeed on 2+. And the only obvious difference between the 'Medium' and 'Hard' levels is the amount of 1s you roll... And don't even get me started on the introduction of the Khorne roster - while leaving out some of the official rosters (Pact, Slann, Underworld). Thumbs down all the way.			"

												A very good startegic board game. Strategy is mainly about positioning and team composition. There are some luck elements in it, but since you play in leagues, you don't have to literally win all the games to progress. There is like 10% hax matches, but 90% of the time skill is the most decisive factor.Private leagues are the way to go here, but the single player is extensive enough to keep a casual player entertained for a long time.Just don't use that god awful blitz mode lol.

												Avoid this game at all costs. While this game hits all the right buttons and promises to be as close to the Table Top game as possible thats as far as it goes. The games are flat and often one sided with a victor decided before the kick off has taken place. So much so that the dice can be so one sided that its stupid. The dice strings are so broken you can see 6 ones in a row and thats just how the games been coded. Not to mention the guys who DDOS attack you while your playing a game so you get booted giving them the auto win. While I love blood bowl I would avoid this company like the plague.			"

												This game... ohhhh this game... It is actually with a very heavy heart that I can actually give it a thumbs down. I am torn and seriously torn at this. I have had a lot of great moments, but a lot of bad moments as well. The problem with this game is in its entire appeal to RNJesus. If you love dice rolling games with a twist of strategy, then this is for you. If you are a diehard strategy nerd, then this game will leave you bitter when the opposing team kills 2 of your star players and then procedes to dodge the rest of your team into a touch down after 3 turns of you rolling 2 attacker downs. The temple of RNG is that of a 6 sided die where 1s are always failures and 6s are always successes. You can stack it in your favor where 2-6 is a success or a 6 is the only success, but you must realize that means there is always a possibility of 17% failure. To me, this is the deal breaker. This to me, breaks the game. This is akin to munchkin(a fine game in certain lights) which can be fun light-heartedly, but if I were to rank this game amongst other strategy games, it has to get the thumbs down.  This game does have many strategic aspects and so I thoroughly enjoy it for a Saturday sitdown, but the mental engagement is severally lacking. You can even tell since the AIs only ability to perform better is through just giving it more perks than you. This always leaves a fairly sour taste in my mouth, but I can usualy power through it if the game plays if engaging enough. This game play isn't. So for the TLDR crowd, if you want an RNG game that mimicks strategy, get this game. If you actually like strategy games, then this game is a no for me.			"

												ARE YOU READY TO RUMBLE IN THE BLOOD BOWL?! Blood Bowl is a combination of a tactical and sports game developed by Cyanide Studios and published by Focus Home Interactive. The basics are extremely simple: two teams, one ball. The team that carries the ball into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown, the team with the most touchdowns at the end of the game is the winner. However, it’s how you decide to do this that makes things interesting, the ends justify the means! It’s not just the players you have at your disposal either. You can bribe the referee to look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying opponents and hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the crowd… Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies.Now, does the game deliver? At first, I was totally skeptical on recieving a tactical sports game, which I had never experienced before playing Blood Bowl, because I had never played one. Fortunately, it's a great game and delivers on the spot. The game is very fun to play as you use your players to travel to the end zone and hopefully not get squashed by the other team. And, you will be squashed, even through your diligent efforts. No matter what difficulty, you will experience challenges including turnovers, bribed referees (which is hilarious), and wizards deciding to mess up your good play. The graphics in this game are...well...it was published in 2010, so you know what I mean. Even though it was published in '10, the graphics are still solid. It is nice to see some gigantic orcs facing the puny humans in a standoff, with some great textures. Even using low settings during the game, the textures function well as well as character models, which is great to see from a game as we don't see it much anymore.How about controls and fluency? The controls are very easy to learn, once again thanks to the tutorial. Also, if you play strategy games, you should recognize controls right away because they're fairly simple to learn. The game is also very fluent with everything going on. The textures of the stadium and with the crowd, are pleasing. The AI is excellent and will 95% match whatever skill you're at, whether it's easy, medium, or hard, some mode will challenge you.This game will mainly interest either sports or strategy fans the most, but that doesn't mean it isn't for you, because it's a great game for everyone. It's tutorial is great in everyway and I wish more game developers as were creative and descriptive, as Cyanide Studios was, with tutorials. There has been a sequel announced to Blood Bowl called Blood Bowl II, but there hasn't been much information leaked to the public. If you're interested in purchasing Blood Bowl, there are two packages you can choose from on Steam: Legendary and Chaos Edition. Legendary Edition costs $19.99 and Chaos Edition costs $29.99. Both are great, but the Chaos Edition (which I tried out), is more preferred so you get the full game and MORE that will only give you hours of more blood!Final Verdict: 8.5/10 - Bloody hell!			"

												A game designed for tabletop and the odd evening with friends and beer that absolutely doesn't work online in an infinite open league; crippled by people powergaming and setting out to ruin your fun whilst a deliberately imbalanced skill system means that only a few teams can compete... combine that with a rule set that is set up to encourage ""fun chaos"" but instead ensures you fail constantly even with perfectly calculated dice odds, and that failure can mean your team ends up outright killed, and the game just isn't worth playing.I tried to love it, I really did; I have fond memories of a few games of the tabletop with my brother long, long ago. But online every single game devolves into the same cycle of Chaos, Dwarves, Chaos, Chaos, or some other brute team which can simply cripple your players and eke out a win... or a few people abusing the Matchmaking by having 5 or so L6 players hidden amongst some throwaway L1s, and then use the overpowered skills stacked on the individuals to humiliate you.Those masses of positive reviews? They're from people who really don't care about the community, but will do what ever they want online and damn what it feels like to you to try and play for fun; they're the people still here years down the line that didn't care the game never took off, because they're in it for the shallow ego boost that comes from using an easy team to win match after match. Seriously, the game designed teams as Easy and Hard difficulty and then suffocates under finding literal easy mode teams in match after match after match...I'm told Blood Bowl 2 rebalanced the teams to make them a bit more equal? But after paying nearly £100 to make this one complete, I'm loathe to let the developers nickle and dime me to an equal level for a game they're already witholding teams for DLC from ...And they never fixed the bugs in this either! Clicking on any player during kick off breaks your ability to swap substitutes out. Players can simply sit on the Intercept roll if you throw the ball and they have a chance to catch it, and force your entire timer to run down. And it's hard to escape the suspicion that people have individual RNG seeds, with some being much worse than others, when you run into bad luck game after game... someone even went as far as telling me my dice were cursed the other day. It's possibly not true, but in a game SO luck dependent, if you're the sort of person who isn't going to abuse the rules for quick overpower, and finds it frustrating to see your strategy fail because someone else did, or the dice went against you, this game will be absolute torture to you.I've installed it twice now, and it kills me every time because of that. I end up seething at people being gits because the rules allow it, and you can't stop them, and I can't even have fun with my own team. If this sounds like you too, for goodness sake don't go near this game, not even with the lovely Warhammer Lore.			"

There is depth, replayability, 2 sets of rules, many different kinds of game you can play from a single match to a campaign, and so on.Graphics are good, the comments from the ""analyst"" and the host are so funny. Music is good. The AI is good, and very tough to beat at hard difficulty level.I recommend this game, especially if you find it under 30$			"

												I'm aware this is a RNG game, and that is one of the things that draws me to these sorts of game, and tabletop wargaming in particular. But this nonsense is suspicious.Every time I get close to winning a match, on easy mind you, things start to go spastic. For example, 0-0 and in the second half, RNG going my way then the AI's, then back again, etc. With the ball two squares from the line, all of a sudden things take a turn for the worse! An enemy zombie is able to go through three red spots, THREE! and picks up the ball. My counter attack with a troll next turn resulted in nothing but red skulls, and for the next three turns in a row, my various counterattacks against said zombie, all resulted in red skulls. Every. Single. One. Even my re-roll. Once the zombie passed the ball to something else and scored, miraculously RNG went normal again, but by then it was too late.Another good example was that one other time I almost won a match on easy. I made the decision to make a roll for an extra square, given that extra square would put me in the try zone. but failed and fell over. Fair enough, that's RNG. For the next three turns however, my high-agility skaven with extra hands and 2+ chance to pick up, fumbled the ball. In those three turns, two human players were well within reach to blitz me, or even move up to block my movement. But they just stood there watching my skaven suddenly become as nifty as a drunken troll's fart.All-in-all, this game would be amazing if it wasn't so blatantly bull even on easy. I'm glad I'm only playing this trash to fill in time until Total War: Warhammer releases. F**k this game./Whine over. Now to go eat some cheese.			"

												It's Blood Bowl. What more needs to be said?It's Games Workshop's most balanced,  entertaining and well thought-out game in their product history,  and this is a faithful digital conversion. There's a team that supports every possible play style, from brutal face-smashers and agile dodgers to thoughtful synergists.You'll either hate this game within minutes of playing it (if you can't handle the element of chance and risk dice bring), or fall in love with it as you realise that it's all about minimising your own risk while maximising your opponent's.If you've played TT BB, it's a no-brainer. If you've never played the table top but are a fan of turn-based strategy that requires real thought  (and ultraviolence), then it's a must buy. Heartily recommended.			"

												Do you like gambling? Do you like American football? Do you like fantasy creatures? Well, Blood Bowl combines all three of these things (dice from gambling, a ruleset based on American football, and teams of creatures from the fantasy Warhammer universe) and turns it into a board game. Blood Bowl Chaos Edition is the most complete digital version of the Blood Bowl board game to date. Almost all of the dice rolling is hidden from the player (unless the player chooses to see it), leaving the player with only the fun choices: what team to play, and then who will be on that team and how they will play. The only dice you'll have to ""touch"" (ie, interact with), are the block dice, which randomly offer you a set number of possible outcomes of unit vs unit interactions based on the strength values of your units (you should really look up the mechanics of Blood Bowl if you want specifics; they're too in depth for me to go into here).However, dice rolling is central to Blood Bowl, so even if you try to ignore it, it will always be there. And, between random events like where the fans come on to the field and knock out half your players and the inevitable moment when one of your players dies, there will be nothing you can do about it. No matter how great your tactical planning or how immense your foe appears, a single dice roll can turn the tide and usually does...in theory.There are ""bad"" teams, meaning you will have a lot of problems if you chose them, and will likely lose. Even if you find a decent team that you want to play, you may have to work harder than you'd expect to play they how they're ""supposed"" to be played. There's a ""cheating"" system that will give you money if you go up agianst higher ranked teams, but there will often be times when the cheats you can afford are simply not good enough. If one of your players gets injured and is forced to miss the next game, you'll be stuck with a mercinary that is always worse than the player it replaces thatnks to a trait called ""Loner."" If one of your players dies, it's gone forever.All of this culminates in a game that feels extremely punishing when you lose and is easy to become addicted to. You may have fun with it, but in my hours of play I rarely did. The dice rolling sucked away over 20 hours of my life, and it wasn't worth it. Avoid unless you love chance-based games.			"

												BLOODBOWL vs. CHAOS LEAGUEI have mixed feelings about this game after buying it cheap in a Steam sale. However I can't really recommend it based on it's history.Let me explain. Originally Cyanide produced a game called Chaos League (with an expansion called Sudden Death) which was a direct take off of Bloodbowl the board game. After a big legal dispute with games workshop they ended up developing Bloodbowl the computer game. The trouble is that I don't think this is an improvement on Chaos League. It's biggest advantage is that you can play it online. However otherwise it's not an improvement and in some regards is worse. Personally I think Chaos League is more fun.Where it falls down in comparison to Chaos League is the dice rolls.  Unlike the boardgame version the dice rolls that the AI makes are suspiciously unrandom. e.g. There should be a 1-6 chance of a fumbled throw but my experience of this was far more frequent (6 times in a row once), the AI rarely fails it's dodge rolls etc and simply put the die rolls often don't seem random, certainly I've never seen dice come up with the same results so often in real life.To my mind another advantage of chaos league is you have the option to play a real time option which you can pause (Which personally I prefer) which allows you to plan your moves and is useful if you want to stop mid-game for any reason. Games also last longer and don't have half time, so no irritating half time whistle just when you were about to score. Chaos League also has the option to buy and develop star players for each race, which are a lot of fun. But you don't get them in Bloodbowl, I also prefer some elements of the layout in Chaos league and some of the little touches such as when a player is killed a little tombstone appears on the pitch and the players spirit is seen departing into the ether. There are a few minor tweaks and improvements in Bloodbowlbut not enough to make it a better game.Overall if you want to play against friends I'd say buy the board game. If you want to play against the computer I'd buy Chaos league (Sudden death edition) it's simply more fun and you won't find yourself swearing at the compurter as much. If you want a strategy game buy football manager. I'd only buy this if you intend to play online.			"

												I got this game because i was a HUGE fan of the tabletop game back in the day.  blood bowl, in my opinion is such a great concept.  sadly the game falls short of capturing the magic of the tabletop game.  very tedious and just overall not fun.			"

												So far, a resounding NO.This is one of those games that doesn't program good strategy for difficulty, but instead screws you on the RNG. I don't recall ever using bad tactics and getting away with it, but I can't count the number of times that I've not gotten away with good tactics either, as the computer somersaults through tacklers numbering three or four on his way out of a fine pickle.Games that rely too heavily on the 'randomness' (if we're even going to call it that) are simply too frustrating to make it worth the effort. The game also does a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job giving you the tools to manage match-ups so understanding the chances of success is a vicious learning curve, most of that curve being your back, bent over, taking the CPUs how-do-you-do up your♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Criminally disappointing quality for this game.Game play is great.AI is quite reasonable and fun on hard mode.Bugginess of the game is dreadful.Sadly the game crashes and glitches quite regularly.One of the most annoying things about the game is when you have less than 11 players on the pitch, it won't let you actually bring on more players. Once again this is sadly not an issue limited to this version of the game, but I had sincerely hoped that it would have been rectified in this one.If you’re an absolute fan and you’ll play through no matter what, then it’s worth it at the discounted rate.Don’t pay full price for this game or you will be disappointed with the quality.Screams of a blatant money grab. Could not have passed through any QA controls and been released like this.I love the game, I just hate to see something so good ruined by such poor coding and quality control "

												it's a good game overall.the rng element is crazy high and you will find yourself rage quitting because you where unlucky enough to get 4 times 1 on the d6 rolls in a row.it will feel like the dice is cheating you and you will be extremely frustrated over that.around 70h was when my anger over it slowed down and i could laugh over seeing the enemy team doing a touch down by running through 6 of my guys dodging on 5+ with each one, then throwing the ball half the map and catching it on a 6 then a 4+ roll, then running it into my zone with 2 rolls of 2+ (d6 dice)... it still pisses me off when i see myself do 4+ rolls of 1's in a row or other silly stuff.in short the rng element of this game is huge and it is the worst about the game.if you can get pass that the game is good. its the same as the old bloodbowl tabletop, if you liked that you will like this :)keep in mind it's a long time ago that game was made and this is the exact same just digital, meaning the false of the old design is still here and nothing have been optimized for our current tech/design knowledge :)game tech wise its, bad, runs badly and can crash.. but nothing major since its turn based its nothing that screw up your game.it got some nice voice over for the first couple of hours then it gets annoying hehe.the information and toturial is terrible you will learn nothing from it. read the rule book instead.there is little info about the rules when you play which is really bad and makes it harder to know what your chances of success sometimes are.there is permadeath of your players, so you can be unlucky and lose your main characters which you have used hours lvling by 2 unlucky dice rolls and you can do nothing to prevent it (RNG again)all in all it is worth the money, but it does have issues that will never get fixed			"

I got absolutely no enjoyment out of the game. Even going through the tutorial was boring and annoying as could be. After playing a few games... no thanks. I will not be returning to play this one. There isn't a tremendous amount of strategy, the RNG is terrible, the graphics poor, and the gameplay repetetive and boring.			"

I thought this was going to be a real-time football game. NOPE. It is turned based, which honestly screws the WHOLE concept up (how in God's name can you have a TURNED BASED football game?!). I thought this was going to be a ""Blitz"" style game which would have been fun. This is the farthest thing from it. Waste of money in my opinion.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  I have enjoyed it at times but there is a lot of dice rolling luck involved.  I am about to score only one defender, a halfling midget!  The halfling kills my Thrower as I run past.  Then my runner fails TWICE to pick up the ball with NO defenders around.  Eventually the halfling picks up the ball on the first try.  FUUUUuuuuuddddgee.  I was on easy mode for Pete's sake!!!The other thing that I dislike, is that there is no clear way to build up your team.  Your players level up but it doesn't seem to do much good.  You can buy better armor but that seems to be worthless.  Again, it seems to be way more luck that strategy.			"

												THIS GAME IS VERY HARD! Sorry for the all caps, but that's what you need to know going into this. Unless you're the kind of person who can handle losing to the AI more often than not (even on Easy difficulty) don't bother with Blood Bowl. This game requires equal degrees of strategic brilliance and utter masochism to be enjoyed. Fans of the game insist the AI doesn't fudge dice rolls in its favor but I'm not so sure on that considering that the AI players almost always make successful dodge rolls regardless of Agility. But, even if it doesn't cheat, this is hardly a relaxing game experience and seems to be aimed at people who enjoy ungodly difficulty.I really gave this game the best chance that I could, playing hotseat matched against myself until I was certain I understood the rules before moving on to play the AI. Ultimately I clocked in about 22 hours of play over the course of five days before deciding to request a refund. That's the other thing, even if the difficulty and very steep learning curve aren't a problem for you this game simply isn't worth the $30 price tag. I wish I could've enjoyed this game, it's very charming and you can tell the people who made it were fans of the original board game but (call me crazy) I think life is frustrating enough without something that's supposed to be for entertainment frustrating you further. This was the only time I've ever requested a refund from Steam based on a game's difficulty (every previous time was because the game had problems running) and this is the first Steam review I'm writing. That should give you an idea of how much Blood Bowl drove me up a wall.			"

												I would not recommend this game due to the lack of casual gameplay on the easy setting and rigged AI dice rolls and turns. Alot of other fanboys will just say  that I am bad or don't understand the game, however, I do get that the game is extreamly in depth and like that aspect, it is why I purchased it in the first place. With that fanboy garb set aside, really looking at the game there are tons of issues for new players and people who just want to have fun, not have to rage about cheap and unfair AI. The AI's dice rolls being rigged are the most frustrating part of the game bar none. If not for these rigged single player settings the game could be real fun. I have no problem with RNG in games in fact I love that aspect, however, this is not the case here. Yet again alot of fanboys and other will continuiously state that it is not rigged, that people just dont understand the brutality of RNG and statistics. but, I do thats the problem, and thats why I know that the game is rigged. In conclusion I would rate this game a 2 out of 10, some people may like the way the game AI cheats, but I think most casual gamers playing on easy just want to enjoy their experience when playing. If I wanted unfair and imbalanced AI I would play on hard setting, Overall, I got this game on sale for 75% off so you would think I cant really complain... but I just got my refund. So if your going to spend any money at all on this title I would suggest doing some research first. You will find I'm not alone in my review. Ok fanboys, let me have it now, you know you all can't contain your bias.Overall rating 2 out of 10main issue being rigged gameplay on single play mode no casual settings just easy=hard normal=real hard and hard=brutalALSO BEWARE FANBOY BIAS, (they can't help themselves)			"

												the game is unfortunately geared to its *warning* new 'real time' play, which I found quirky and unpolished, even when played in 'classic mode', perhaps even more so in 'classic mode', both are aweful in a similiar yet still their own way. Maybe its just the first field. full disclosure, I could not get passed the 1st full match, and i played a few games of it, in both new and classic mode. I would say, overall, its a less solid game then one would expect, something like a trailer like game or idk, just a different direction i guess, not all improvements are good improvements. personally, i found the game simply disappointing, all around, from the new voices for old announcer fiend/friends to the ‘new’ game play options, which ruin the game. But that’s me, and perhaps you don't care what i think, perhaps you say, you didn't give it a chance, fair engough, if you still must buy this game, loving Blood Bowl 2 that much, then don't spend more than $5, if a dollar, or if for some reason its finally included in something free --yes, free would be best, best to wait for that. And really, this is coming from someone who downright loved Blood Bowl 2; that was a great game. But this game, not so much, no, not so much at all. no, not at all.			"

												This game is unplayable trash. Its like normal football... exept all luck. its not a ""strategy"" game. It's roll the dice, highest number wins. The players will fail at PICKING THE BALL UP! LIKE, WHY? It's trash. that's why. also throws have about a %50of being complete. and if you miss you can pick the ball back up. Right? No. Wrong. if you drop the ball its a turn over. AND AI NEVER DROPS THE BALL. Is that how the devolopers thought football was like? yea well if they did they are right. Drop the ball? Turn over. Miss a pass? Turnover. I get it's fiction. But still. this is unplayable. I don't care if MICKEY MOUSE JUMPS ON THE FIELD (That doesn't happen). I JUST WANT IT TO BE PLAYABLE!!! I Don't know if the 2nd one's any better... Because I'm not buying it. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! anyone remember Rugby 15? well this is like that... if you couldn't pick up the ball... Thats how bad it is... don't buy it...  It's Trash...			"

												Was really disappointed with this one.Looked great,orcs and lizardmen!  what could go wrong?  To sum it up the playability of this game is tedious,slow,and annoying.Did i mention slow?   The way turnovers work in this game sucks and i mean sucks! Do not buy this.I really wish i could get my money back.      Let me explain...it has nothing to do with fumbles or interceptions mind you.Everytime your player comes near     the other team,there is a roll.Now I understand randomness,,,but this style of play is horrible.There is no flow.    Cool art and universe aside,this game could have been so much more.Its atrocious gameplay style wrecks      what could be an amazing concept.Something I've thought about since D&D and Madden days of old.(think 90's)        Seroiusly wished i looked at a gameplay video before pulling the trigger on this one,I would definetly reccomend          doing so before purchasing.I never played any other Blood bowl and i think i never will if its similar with      the style of play.           Hope this saves you			"

												I love Warhammer, I love American Football and i most importantly love death. However this game is just far too difficult, even the 'easy' AI is quite the challenge. However i enjoy the game and it has some limited customization to it. The depth of development of a team is impressive and the amount of ways to play is even more enjoyable. This game actually really does it all, sadly for me the only thing that's made it difficult to play is my own failings in ability.However a strong 9/10 for anyone who is actually not a n00b.			"

This version really captures everything that was great about the board game and makes it easy to find other enthusiasts.

												A fun tactical game. That lets you play a hybrid of American Football and Rugby. In the Warhammer Fantasy universe. And beat the snot out of the opposing team if you so desire. A solid game with a great look to it (Seeing how they emulated the minutures from the actual Tabletop version of the game, it can't be that hard). My only complaint is that it is dice based. As such, you'll have to pray to the dice gods apleanty. However, Nuffle cares not for these silly affairs!Get it. Seriously. Get it!			"

												Mideval sports where killing is legal! That's one of many ways to describe Blood Bowl, a game that has you jumping for joy one minute and crying the next.Based off the original board game, Blood Bowl is an American Football game mixed with chess-like strategy. You'll position players, throw blocks, and hopefully score touchdowns. Graphically BB doesn't offer much, you have a handful of stadiums and some customizable players, but where Blood Bowl really shines is its diverse character roster. 23 races fill BB stadiums, from the sleek Amazons, to the toughened Orcs, to the completely useless Halfling teams, each race works differently, and it's up to you to find which one fits your play style. For those who love destroying the enemy team, the minotaur teams of Chaos are for you, boasting strong players to help maim as many players as possible. Want to go around them, Skaven will do just fine. Wanna launch a hail mary, High Elf. However, keep in mind that each team has conflicting weakness that you must tailor your strategy to.BB plays out kind of like chess and American Football wrapped in one. Two teams battle it out over 16 turns to score as many touchdowns as possible. This is where things get interesting. It takes a whle to get used to the rules and understand how everything works, but stick it out and you'll see the beauty. You'll see all kinds of strategies, like the typical punch everything style of Orcs to the outrageous physical game with Skaven, and you have to tailor your plan accordingly. Keep in mind that all the mechanics are dice based, like the original board game, so even though you baited the team and are set to make a perfect hand off, Nuffle (the BB God of the Dice) may say ""Nope!"" and have him drop the ball, so no strategy is fool proof. When your not beating people/getting beaten sensless, you're buying players, leveling up players, and hiring cheerleaders and coaches. Blood Bowl's skill system is a lttle weird, having you roll dice. If you roll singles, you get to choose from a select few. Singles over a certain amount allow you to boost one of their skills. Doubles lets pick any skill or, if allowed, mutate, which gives you special abilities for certain races AND changes the corresponding character model, so expect to see a few Chaos Beastmen with tentacles, claws, or an extra head or arm.The Verdict:+Fun Customization+Strategies for each race+23 races-Dice based combat system8/10 GreatIf you can get past the rules, find the right team, and accept that a few bad rolls are going to happen, then I sincerely recommend buy Blood Bowl.

												Blood Bowl is great. As a note, although this game offers a single player experience, it's really meant to be played multiplayer. To really get the most from it you have to join a league where you can take advantage of growing a team with game-to-game improvements, assuming too many of your players don't get seriously hurt or die during the games. This involves some headaches having to schedule weekly matches with other players but the combination of American football, chess and craps with RPG leveling mechanics on players makes for a very entertaining game.

												The most up to date version of an awesome tactical game. I like chess, but always wanted to see more of the action it represents. That we have here.It's like Rugby or American Football with a good step towards reality. Here punches connect, bones break, and occasionally pieces of armor get stuck in chainsaws. If you like the general picture Games Workshop paints of the Auld World, even better.The additional teams include a wide range since the game was published, the two here are the old timer Chaos Dwarves with their powerful Bull centaurs and nasty hobgoblins, and the Demons of Khorne who, I have to admit, are less violent than a halfling team. Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but still, no block, Strength 3 Armor 7 overall is not what you'd call fighty... still, there is the Bloodthirster.I'd recommend this game for anyone who likes Warhammer, turn based tactics, chess, or comic violence.

												I really used to love Speedball on the Amiga & again on the PSOne which is why I bought this. I liked all the early GW PC games such as Space Hulk & Dark Omen. I own several of the boardgames including Talisman, Space Hulk, Warhammer (both) & othersThis is American football with Goblins & Elves based on a board game that came out in the 80s. There are two modes, one which is faithful to the board game; ""Classic"" and one more suited to a PC game; ""Blitz""Classic is very freaking difficult initially without having read the charts in the manuals. It's turn based and you hand control to the opposition every time something fails. Which at first  is often. Really often. I think it took 4 hours before I scored. After 25 or so I'm giving them a good spankingBlitz is easier, but the game adds a twist. I had won every game, advanced players through several levels, completed a season and it crashed. Without a save game. Started over and it crashed again after about 3 matches. And again without ever saving a game automatically to the point where if I ever meet a wood elf I will punch it in the face just on general principles. Classic seems to be completely stable, maybe it's a side effect of Blitz? Either way, ""save without quitting"" after every matchChaos Edition is just Legendary Edition with a few more frills, don't be a doofus and buy both like me7/10 if you don't mind turn based games with a learning curve			"

												Very high learning curve, fairly faithful adaptation of the board game. It is unfortunately not ""Full featured"" as some of the star players are missing and some skills don't work quite right, but it's pretty close, and a good substitute for spending a couple hundred dollars on minatures and spending a weekend with a bunch of sweaty geeks.If you get frustrated easily, this game will not be for you.  The amount of times you seem to fail die rolls while the computer doesn't will aggravate you to no end until you understand all of the rules of the game, at which point the AI will be a pathetic competitor, providing no challenge at all.  Given all that, you can still get many hundreds of hours out of it, fine tuning your strategy in single player, playing many different races in many different manners.The online league interface is unfortunately a little haphazard.  League management controls are somewhat limited and not as fleshed out as I'd like them to be, but it's entirely serviceable.  Random online matchmaking does exist, but you'll notice that the matching system isn't based upon skill as much as it is based upon cheesing the system, by using teams at their specific overpowered points in the rankings.  Really where the game shines is in a league setting with 16 or more like minded individuals in a structured season/playoff format.  I ran an online league for several seasons, and most of the guys would agree it was an incredible amount of fun, even when their team was getting destroyed.It is a pretty niche game, but if you fit that niche, you will enjoy it to no end.  Or complain about the RNG and never play it again.  One or the other.			"

												Best substitute for chess ever. It has violence. Orks. Chaos. Dark Elves. Ogres. Playing madden.It's all turn based and it has the exact same learning curve as the actual board game, but it's a very intelligent game as a result which requires good gambling skills.The game's a bit aged now but still great fun to play, especially while waiting for the sequel (!) Blood Bowl II to come out. It's still active online too, at least at the moment of writing, and you want to be playing this game online to really learn it properly.If you're looking for a game that challenges you to think and the idea of online chess where you can kill, foul and injure your opponents sounds interesting to you, give this game a chance. Just note that you need some patience, an average BB game against a human opponent typically lasts at least 1 hour.			"

If you have Legendary edition there really is no need to get this one as the 3 new teams arent that good and the new skill sux majorly as it is a negetive skill not a positive one. Stay playing Legendary edition as Chaos edition is compatible with Legendary anyways and everyone plays in the same MP lobby  and Legendary teams can play vs Chaos teams whether you own Chaos edition or not. You just cant create Chaos edition teams if you dont have it. The 3 new teams and the 1 new skill just arent worth the price. This should have been DLC for Legendary at about 2.99 in price.			"

												Blood Bowl makes American Football look like a pillow fight. The turn based strategy football game features fantasy teams based on the Warhammer franchise. The game will make you happy to see a beloved board game played on your computer against anyone in the world as well as angry as the dice screws you over. I played online with my dwarf team and made an amazing pass rolling a 6 for the launch and a 5 for the catch only to directly after roll a 1 whilst Going for it and then re-roll a 1 making my player fall instead of scoring. The game is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone, especially those who have friends playing it. Making an online league between friends will give you a thrilling experience as you kill your best friends star player and scores the winning touchdown. The game is very good, although it is quite slow paced and can get boring if you're not really psyched to play. It is not a game I recommend for ""I have nothing to do"" gaming since the games are long and can get quite dull. But when you are in the mood for som Blood Bowl, this game will enlighten your day and waste your hours when you should be working.7/10			"

												It is thanks to the tgs leauge that i started this game and since the leauge started i have not been able to stop playing. This game has all the excitment of a sports game  and more. In it you are able to make your own team with persitent players that can level up and get new skills to make the game more complex. This game is the way fantasy football should be with teams and players you create it just happens to be heavy on the fantasy part. It even has a built in league function.The story mode is more of a challenge mode ie get 2 touchdowns 3 passes in 8 turns.  The campaign mode is a great way to get into the game as you will start out with team of little to no skills and have to level them up and get more bonuses for your team as you would in leauge play. Make sure to use sites like bbtactics to learn the game and watch the tgs games and total biscuits explanations of the game or cknoors basics. And remember this game may not be for everyone.And is a dice based game as it was a board game where dice is used to randomize gameplay so do not blame the game and call bs as you can increase the odds of the dice working the way you want them to if you know how.

												I didn't expect to like it that much, but I really enjoyed it. You can choose to play it in almost exactly the same way that you would play the original Games Workshop game. It's a lot deeper than I expected a fantasy rugby/gladiator simulator to be. The different types of teams offer very unique challanges to play for or against, and random chance will sometimes force you to adapt your tactics on the fly, so the game has a lot of variability, which I really like.I have yet to play this game on multiplayer, but so far it seems well ballanced, tactically and strategically deep, and yet does not bog down too much in details. It's fun to have a team which slowly improves over the course of long, multi-year campaigns. Choosing the different types of skills and statistics to improve when your players level up is a lot of fun, and very rewarding. Somewhat similar to games like XCOM.There are a satisfying variety of options in this game, except I wish that there were more options available during play. As a gameplay design choice, they made it so that you can't really change much of anything once the game has started, which I don't really mind (turns have a time limit).This game is a much, much more polished and well made conversion of a GW game to the computer than Space Hulk is			"

												Easy to learn, near impossible to master. Frustrating, but brilliant strategy and practicing and developing a playstyle, will allow the more fun options to come out. Which are extremely satisfying (Pushing a chainsaw wielding goblin over and subsequently it killing itself with it's own weapon, permanently eliminating that particular player for the entire campaign)  Each of the 23 teams has a small number of play styles which a person can cater to, or not. But deciding how to play (after losing a lot) will help find a team leading to some satisfying success'. Hard to recommend only because of the upright learning curve, but playing with a friend can knock down that steepness tons.			"

												Blood Blow, what a lovely game :)let's get straight to the meatPros: - replayability. this game has a lot - teams. there's plenty - graphics, they're not great, but good enough to enjoy it and not hw intense - sound, it has the feel of Blood Bowl. commentary is hilarious, music is decent and sound effects    and background noise are well done - it's hard. 3 games on easy to the first TD, another 2 to the first win (it was more luck than anything    else), countless of abilities, modificators, re-rerolls and rules for a player to be challenged and      engaged for dozens of hours at leastCons - commentary does not offer any variety. 2 games in and you will probably have heard it all (except    for some team specific lines) - graphics are not that great :P - prepare to rage at the dice. if you can't take a loss because of bad luck, don't even start this game - it's hard.overall I feel that this game represents Blood Bowl in all the right aspects.it's brutal, fun and endearingly charming. I find myself cheering my team and even getting drunk on victories.I haven't tried the online play, so I have nothing to say on that, but I am eager to try as soon as I mastered more of the game itself.definitely worth the money, that goes twice on a sale.

												I am a long time fan of BB and Games Workshop generally. The concept of BB and its universe is so rich that this should have been an amazing game BUT Cyanide got the licence to develop the game and, unfortunately, they butchered it, initially.  Whilst the initial release of this game was horrible, after several years/patches/upgrades, it is now very enjoyable 7.5/10. The interface and UI are still terrible, but you will get used to it. And the graphics now look pretty dated compared to BB2, but dont let that put you off.  This is an infinitely better game than BB2, which Cyanide is doing its best job to butcher, again.Buy this if you like a bit of a tactical level up grind'fest.Dont buy this if you are a bad loser - the random number generated (RNG) dice rolls do feel somewhat 'rigged' against you sometimes.....

												I really used to love Speedball on the Amiga & again on the PSOne which is why I bought this. I liked all the early GW PC games such as Space Hulk & Dark Omen. I own several of the boardgames including Talisman, Space Hulk, Warhammer (both) & othersThis is American football with Goblins & Elves based on a board game that came out in the 80s. There are two modes, one which is faithful to the board game; ""Classic"" and one more suited to a PC game; ""Blitz""Classic is very freaking difficult initially without having read the charts in the manuals. It's turn based and you hand control to the opposition every time something fails. Which at first  is often. Really often. I think it took 4 hours before I scored. After 25 or so I'm giving them a good spankingBlitz is easier, but the game adds a twist. I had won every game, advanced players through several levels, completed a season and it crashed. Without a save game. Started over and it crashed again after about 3 matches. And again without ever saving a game automatically to the point where if I ever meet a wood elf I will punch it in the face just on general principles. Classic seems to be completely stable, maybe it's a side effect of Blitz? Either way, ""save without quitting"" after every matchChaos Edition is just Legendary Edition with a few more frills, don't be a doofus and buy both like me7/10 if you don't mind turn based games with a learning curve			"

												Best substitute for chess ever. It has violence. Orks. Chaos. Dark Elves. Ogres. Playing madden.It's all turn based and it has the exact same learning curve as the actual board game, but it's a very intelligent game as a result which requires good gambling skills.The game's a bit aged now but still great fun to play, especially while waiting for the sequel (!) Blood Bowl II to come out. It's still active online too, at least at the moment of writing, and you want to be playing this game online to really learn it properly.If you're looking for a game that challenges you to think and the idea of online chess where you can kill, foul and injure your opponents sounds interesting to you, give this game a chance. Just note that you need some patience, an average BB game against a human opponent typically lasts at least 1 hour.			"

												Great Game, to play in a league against your friends....Single player is lacking but good place to learn, even on Hard the Computer AI is very poor... I personally don't think it does but if the program does try to compensate with fudging a little on the roll results.. it needs to do it more.. ALOT more.. because once anyone gets the barest understanding of basic strategy, the game becomes almost a walk through in single player... with any team... even Halfling.I've played the Board game and the online Java....and in Multiplayer..for the most part this is much the same..just prettier.The Game is incredibly deep....fairly easy to learn...more difficult to master.... and frustrating for new players, I recommend new players start a single player Campaign as either Humans or Orks...to learn the ropes...1st thing you need to know is blocking and assisting on blocking, once you learn how that works...thoughts of the computer cheating will diminish.Once you discover you are unbeatable vs the Computer , you are ready for the real fun...against a human opponent.When you do go online..remain a purest don't let someone trying to pad their stats coax you into 2min turns (usually fast elf or skaven player)anyone that plays the game knows that shorter clock HEAVILY favours the faster more agile teams.Have fun and enjoy..it's worth learning the game and once you do you will always be looking for an opportunity to play			"

												Auuugghh... I REALLY want to post a positive review of this game. I do. I've been a Blood Bowl fan for years. It's the fantasy-sports-comedy game of your dreams. So what's the problem? Playing with friends online is such an enormous PITA and so unnecessarily complicated that half of my recorded playtime has actually been spent in the menus trying to get the @#$% to work. I also really don't appreciate that once my team gets put in a league, it's basically in a tomb -- you can never again use the team outside that league. League manager lost interest in the game? Can't add a friend to the league due to aforementioned complicated PITA? TDB. Start all over with creating a new team. Once you're actually IN a game and PLAYING, it's a great game -- hilarious and lots of fun. But good luck ever getting there. Really hope this gets fixed for BB2.			"

												Oh yes, I approve of this message!I recommend Blood Bowl Chaos. And there's not much I can add to the others who approve of it as well.I will say that if you like chess; I mean really enjoy the game of chess or other similar turn-based games, there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't be experiencing this. The only ""con"" I see is the way the matches and playoffs are displayed. I want something more graphical then what they decided to go with. That's not really important to you, however; and you may like the layout. The ""pros"" are so much better though. Like the fact that at any time you could lose one of your best players  due to being killed on the pitch (PERMADEATH). The money system , inducments, variety of teams, variety of gameplay and matches, variety of seasonal formats...the list goes on. Plus, you can enjoy the game on or offline.I hate the Wood Elves but I sure as hell enjoy playing against them. :) "

												I can safely say I'm addicted to this game. Don't get me wrong, this game takes a LOT of getting used to. I thought I'd be able to jump into it, and then play, and win. Nope. I've lost 30 games in a row, and have only scored 3 Touch Downs. You MUST understand the game, you must understand the rules. I took four hours out of my night to sit down and read the rule book cover to cover, then a book about blocking, then a book about the Human race. And then played a game the next day and won. It takes time to get used to. This IS a tabletop game turned into a PC game btw. So don't assume you'll jump into it and be the best. Most likely, you won't. You'll probably end up rage quitting like I have many times. So you are on the field, they kick off. Your catcher fails to catch the ball. Okay. You go to pick it up, nope. Fails to pick it up. Turnover. They knock down your defensive line. 5 of your guys are now either KO'd, Injured, or Dead. Finally they end their turn and you get the chance to go. Pick up the ball, attempt to knock over their defenses... nope. You rolled 2 red skulls... okay, reroll. One red Skull, and a Knock Defense down. Hell yeah, okay. Next guy. Nope two skulls. Turnover.It goes a little like that. It's a dice game. So if you can't understand the mechanics behind it then please don't play this.There are people still playing this game. Last I checked (last night) there were around 100 people online. And over 300 matches played that day. Also if you go on Reddit you can find people making leagues, tournaments, and championships. So it's pretty awesome.ALSO. BloodBowl 2 is coming out in SEPTEMBER.So if you enjoy this one. Just wait for the updated engine, graphics, everything of 2.			"

												I have played Blood Bowl for a couple of decades both on tabletop and on the free alternative to this game.The gameengine is ok - nice graphics - only thing that is REALLY missing is an 2d option.It has a few bugs but they are smaller and fewer than ever.The main issue has been the weird priorities of the developers. A real time option - why on earth spend time on that - when half the races was missing? The answer is noone would have paid for that as an extra (like they made us pay for basic races).The problem for me is the statistics and the ingame community features are boring and you do not get a feeling of being part of af huge community.(at least the spectate option is there now)There is alot of games where you play someone that obviously has no idea what he/she is doing. It ends up in an extremely onesided match - where more often than not the new player gets either mad and uses profanity or just leaves the game on - for you to wait for the timeout every turn. The other problem is the huge percentage of games where the opponent just quit (without any significant penalty).The game also had an weird priority in which races should be availeble first - but that is history now.I love Blood Bowl in all forms - so I really hope they overhall the commynitypart of the game - and creates something like divisions for coaches. So everybody has to play XXX amout of games in ""the college divisions"" before moving to the ""NFL"".That would give everybody a better experiance - the new coaches would not be preyed upon - and it should result in a higher percentage of close matches.Blood Bowl is one of the best boardgames around - and this is becoming better and better - but there is still someway to go.It is the best around (actually pretty much the only option around now that fumbbl more or less died) - but there are a huge amount of work to do for Cyanide to UP the community.

												7/10Blood Bowl is a fun, if frustrating, PC version of the classic table top game. If you enter it with the expectation that it will be funny and a catastrophy, then you'll probably have a good time. If you think it'll play like an actual ball game, then you'll probably hate it. The Run Down: There are two types of teams: teams that smash and teams that play ball well. My recommendation is to start with a team that smashes well, such as The Undead, Necromantic, or one of the Chaos/Nurgal/Khorne teams. Everything is done by D6 rolls, so you will fail constantly at everything. You'll fail at picking up a ball that your players surround, you'll fail at throwing a ball to a player two inches away, and you'll fail at smashing a player 1/4 your size and strength. Luckily, the other team fails at an equal rate. Even on ""Easy"" this game is challenging. I picked this up in that massive developer pack with Styx, and this is one of the few games in that huge pack that's worth anything at all.Try it out.			"

												If you like, warhammer in general or blood bowl in particular you will like this game.  If you already have a version of the game think long and hard before buying.  There are no earth shattering changes in the game.  It is the saem game as always with a couple of other races.  The AI always seems to make the rolls it needs when it needs them, but overall it is a great game.  If you don't have a version already on your computer, this would be the version I would recommend.			"

The longevity and community around this is great and well worth the buy. I'll be playing this for a long time yet, trying different teams and play styles both against the AI and particularly online.

												Blood Bowl makes American Football look like a pillow fight. The turn based strategy football game features fantasy teams based on the Warhammer franchise. The game will make you happy to see a beloved board game played on your computer against anyone in the world as well as angry as the dice screws you over. I played online with my dwarf team and made an amazing pass rolling a 6 for the launch and a 5 for the catch only to directly after roll a 1 whilst Going for it and then re-roll a 1 making my player fall instead of scoring. The game is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone, especially those who have friends playing it. Making an online league between friends will give you a thrilling experience as you kill your best friends star player and scores the winning touchdown. The game is very good, although it is quite slow paced and can get boring if you're not really psyched to play. It is not a game I recommend for ""I have nothing to do"" gaming since the games are long and can get quite dull. But when you are in the mood for som Blood Bowl, this game will enlighten your day and waste your hours when you should be working.7/10			"

												This is probably one of the most frustrating games I've played. If you are used to playing Wargame stuff with dice rolls then it will probably be less frustrating for you as you'll probably be used to it. The game is generally very confusing, especially the panel layout and the way the teams function.The campaign wa aweful, I restarted 5 times just to find a team I could understand. Even on easy dificulty, the games randomness makes it difficult. I really need to stop buying turn based Games Workshop games, always dissapointed			"

												I CANNOT PROPERLY REVIEW THIS GAME SINCEI AM JUST TOO BUSY TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY IT...HOWEVER...I found out that you can set both teams to AI, change from turn based to real time and then just watch a Blood-Bowl match in real time. I had a BLAST just watching! Actually pretty entertaining for the $5-6 I paid for it when you think of it that way. Now once or twice a month I kick back with a beer and watch the Orcland Raiders kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the Reikland Reavers. GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES! The commentators do get quite repetitive after a while though and i really wish you could make the matches longer.8/10 I wish I had time to learn this game. Maybe someday :P			"

												Not bad, and I'm glad they fixed the bugs that plagued the console version (including skill dropping from player profiles, which was awful...)Very faithful to the boardgame, and the Blitz game variant is an interesting (if not particularly engaging) variation, which plays more like a popular series of American Football video games.A few things could certainly be improved on, and might affect your enjoyment of this game, so be aware:* Although injuries, including death, are permanent for your team, they mean absolutely nothing to the computer teams, which return to their starting condition after every single match. That gets a little old after a while. There's no sense of permancy other than on your side of the pitch, and it makes it tempting to rely on ""save-scumming"" to get through tricky matches.* I would vastly prefer a way to choose exactly which teams are 'legal' - even if it was just a way to pick which of the expansion teams were included rather than the current all-or-nothing approach. Be prepared for constant, tedious battles with Khemri...* If playing a solo game, the computer continually spams pathetic 'smack talk' style messages at you in chat, which do nothing to aid immersion but reveal rather more about what the developers think of you as a person (or what kind of person they think plays their game).Those annoyances aside, it's really not a bad game at all.

The concept is fun and it is a great adaptation of an excellent board game, but at this point in it's lifespan the multiplayer is hard to get into as well as being rife with bugs and possible exploits that are never going to be fixed.  The single player can be very entertaining, but the AI is inconsistent, to put it mildly.			"

												Dice rolling, face smashing, strategizing MADNESS!So within my first week owning the game.. I've put in 63 hours and counting.I can say without a doubt; if you love board games, sports, fantasy, and/or D&D just stop reading and go buy this game!I did not play the tabletop before this, or knew there was a tabletop (which now I might consider getting) so my first impression was.. WTF I CAN'T DO ANYTHING. The AI seemed hard on easy, there were too many skills to know what was going on, I didn't know how to position players, and I kept getting slaughtered (literally) by teams.Just be patient and learn the game! Once I spent some time with it, I slowly started to figure out WHY things were happening even if I didn't know what skills were doing or what rolls were going on.  The rewarding feeling for scoring, winning, and (of course) injuring other players is so satisfying! And it will keep you coming back for more.One day when I stop flip flopping races and finish a campaign, I will try my hand at online matches and leagues. Hopefully it will remind me some of Madden's Online Franchise, or NCAA Football's Online Dynasty. But we all have our own dreams.

												Blood Blow, what a lovely game :)let's get straight to the meatPros: - replayability. this game has a lot - teams. there's plenty - graphics, they're not great, but good enough to enjoy it and not hw intense - sound, it has the feel of Blood Bowl. commentary is hilarious, music is decent and sound effects    and background noise are well done - it's hard. 3 games on easy to the first TD, another 2 to the first win (it was more luck than anything    else), countless of abilities, modificators, re-rerolls and rules for a player to be challenged and      engaged for dozens of hours at leastCons - commentary does not offer any variety. 2 games in and you will probably have heard it all (except    for some team specific lines) - graphics are not that great :P - prepare to rage at the dice. if you can't take a loss because of bad luck, don't even start this game - it's hard.overall I feel that this game represents Blood Bowl in all the right aspects.it's brutal, fun and endearingly charming. I find myself cheering my team and even getting drunk on victories.I haven't tried the online play, so I have nothing to say on that, but I am eager to try as soon as I mastered more of the game itself.definitely worth the money, that goes twice on a sale. But expect a merciless round based table top that is extremily rewarding			"

It's violent to a degree and adds new meaning to the term 'fantasy football'.  What's more is that you can play leagues online or even campaign in single player format.  Over time your team and individual players will build up skills provided they don't get killed or maimed.  Good times to had.  Don't miss out!  'Ere we go!			"

												Very high learning curve, fairly faithful adaptation of the board game. It is unfortunately not ""Full featured"" as some of the star players are missing and some skills don't work quite right, but it's pretty close, and a good substitute for spending a couple hundred dollars on minatures and spending a weekend with a bunch of sweaty geeks.If you get frustrated easily, this game will not be for you.  The amount of times you seem to fail die rolls while the computer doesn't will aggravate you to no end until you understand all of the rules of the game, at which point the AI will be a pathetic competitor, providing no challenge at all.  Given all that, you can still get many hundreds of hours out of it, fine tuning your strategy in single player, playing many different races in many different manners.The online league interface is unfortunately a little haphazard.  League management controls are somewhat limited and not as fleshed out as I'd like them to be, but it's entirely serviceable.  Random online matchmaking does exist, but you'll notice that the matching system isn't based upon skill as much as it is based upon cheesing the system, by using teams at their specific overpowered points in the rankings.  Really where the game shines is in a league setting with 16 or more like minded individuals in a structured season/playoff format.  I ran an online league for several seasons, and most of the guys would agree it was an incredible amount of fun, even when their team was getting destroyed.It is a pretty niche game, but if you fit that niche, you will enjoy it to no end.  Or complain about the RNG and never play it again.  One or the other.			"

												Blood Bowl is such an excellent, underrated, and underappreciated game. Chaos Edition is probably the best translated value in the entire Steam world, as buying the actual miniatures for every race in the game would cost thousands of dollars/euros.			"

Once you got the mechanics down, and with some luck you can have a pretty OP team and that feels awesome.  Looking forward to the next game coming out soon.			"

												Same game, new races. But thats ok. I always liked steam rolling the opposition with the dwarves. No really they have a spiked steam roller. It's that kind of game. If you don't have Legendary, Chaos Edition might be a better choice for you. Gameplay is about the same. The AI isn't quite any smarter either. That may change with the upcoming Blood Bowl II.Still all in all a fun if sometimes frustrating game.			"

												Now I'm not a huge fan of sports, hence why I spend my days on Steam. But boy did this game score a touchdown in my books! I've got very little hours on it, I know, but from the second I saw that this was Warhammer American Football it got me, this is something that's not been done before and it works oh so well! Sure you have your games like Fifa, NFL, and such but I'm a huge fan of Warhammer.I found it far too satisfying to make a Goblin sized hole in the ground, under the foot of my Kroxigor, break the opposing teams line of defense with a wall of Saurus and slip a nimble Skink, who just pinched the ball from said pool-of-guts-goblin, through the wall and on his fair way to the touchdown line to be, himself, gored on a minotaur horn and kicked the opposite direction. It's a brutal, brutal world filled with anger, both kinds of balls being kicked, blood, rage, and a heck of a lot of fun!			"

												A few hours in, I can say the UI is the most significant obstacle to successfully playing this game.  If you turn away for a moment and look back, you could be expected to make a timed decision, but the game will not tell you what kind of decision you are supposed to be making.  The training system is a complete disaster: First, there is nothing to tell you to click the stop button, second, the UI is employed as a device to keep you from attempting a re-roll without using control-alt-delete.  There are no multiple saves, so if you accidentally click the ""save wtihout quitting"" rather than the ""quit without saving"" button, then your campain is screwed.  No confirmation what-so-ever.  There is no menu command to quit the game without passing through several loading screens first.  These are a few examples, but the UI suffers from other confusing issues as well and is a complete catastrophe.Its unfortunate because the game seems like it would be fun to play otherwise.  After being forced to re-roll my team from scratch 5 times due to UI blunders, I'm disinclined to play and uninterested in purchasing again in the future. "

												Overall rating - 4/5It started off with Brutal Football, a retro Amiga game, when I tried to desperately locate a fantasy setting football game. This one was arcade and I was more into strategy but it didn't matter. Then came Crush! Deluxe. Oh my God, we have a great time on co-op with my little brother and the possibilities were endless. And then came the apex - a board game in a fantasy setting with football as main team. Can it get any better?The game does have its flaws and at some point it gets a bit repetitive but the first touchdown / fatality / 7 tile pass / quadra evade are worth it. If you love tile games, orcs and elves and you're at least a bit into football - be sure to get it.			"

												I've played the game in its table top form since the early 90's. This is an excellent duplication of that game.You can't judge it against modern computer games, because those try to keep everybody happy. Blood Bowl may break up friendships, set brother against brother, sister against sister and generally♥♥♥♥♥♥off everybody at some point in time. Because it honestly does not care about your feelings. And that's why you know it's a true to life replication of the original Blood Bowl experience. If you think the game is cheating to beat you, you haven't paid attention to the odds. The RNG is not broken. I've seen people smash real world dice with a hammer, or melt them into puddles, for rolling triple skulls, TWICE in a row. Do not imagine that it's impossible for the computer to roll the exact same way on that game winning play.A lot of people say that the game is bugged. I've watched a lot of games on YouTube where somebody has blamed a bug for a play not going the way it's supposed to (in their head) or for the ""wrong"" dice being rolled. Haven't seen one yet where that person didn't just miss one of the rules, or spot the goblin marking their treeman, ruining the assist for that ever so crucial extra die on a block.Like the original game, there are problems. Team progression (trying to build them up, whilst minimising damage costs and replacement players) can be very difficult to manage, sometimes not even worth it. But that's not the real fun of the game. The real fun is in taking on your friends in blood-thirsty combat and beating them with a humiliating three point lead. It's in screaming that ""DWARVES IS CHEATING!"" and your opponent smiling and saying, ""yes. Dwarves is,"" and then proceeding to wipe the field with your squishy elf team.It's a game of playing the odds and knowing that even when you DO play the odds, they're only odds, not certainties.And if you ever anger Nuffle, RNGsus help you.

												If you enjoy strategy games and/or Games Workshop you won't regret getting Blood Bowl.It wonderfully combines the complex strategy and ridiculous silliness inherent in many Games Workshop creations. It is easy enough to pick up straight away, but the complexity will have you coming back for more. The sheer blind luck of dice-rolling adds to the fun, brutally adding in the element of chance which can scupper your best-laid plans. All in all, yes. Buy it. It's a laugh.			"

												I think there might be a perfectly good game in here. As a matter of fact, I'm positive that there is. The problem here is that I have no idea how the hell I'm supposed to play properly and the game has no intention of teaching me, either. When a game developer has enough contempt for their audience to use the tutorial for a relatively complex game to teach the bare minimum and tell the player to read the (sizeable) rule book if they want to understand anything beyond this, they're obviously in the wrong business.If you're already a fan of the tabletop Blood Bowl, this game is a faithful recreation (so far as I can tell) and you'll probably love it. For anyone else, unless you're willing to invest several hours into studying how the game works and a lot of trial and error, steer clear.			"

												7/10Blood Bowl is a fun, if frustrating, PC version of the classic table top game. If you enter it with the expectation that it will be funny and a catastrophy, then you'll probably have a good time. If you think it'll play like an actual ball game, then you'll probably hate it. The Run Down: There are two types of teams: teams that smash and teams that play ball well. My recommendation is to start with a team that smashes well, such as The Undead, Necromantic, or one of the Chaos/Nurgal/Khorne teams. Everything is done by D6 rolls, so you will fail constantly at everything. You'll fail at picking up a ball that your players surround, you'll fail at throwing a ball to a player two inches away, and you'll fail at smashing a player 1/4 your size and strength. Luckily, the other team fails at an equal rate. Even on ""Easy"" this game is challenging. I picked this up in that massive developer pack with Styx, and this is one of the few games in that huge pack that's worth anything at all.Try it out.			"

												I've been playing Blood Bowl for decades in all formats.  This is okay if you can't play tabletop games and you don't like the FUMBBL version.  I still play it but mainly against the AI to give me something to do when the missus is watching Grand Designs.  It's no challenge vs the computer at all but it's still kinda fun.  I don't play online anymore as it kept disconnecting on me or my opponents just disconnected if I was winning a matchmaking game.  If you can join a structured league like UKBBL or play against your mates you'll have some good games.If you do buy this, wait until it's on sale for £5 or so.			"

												If you've never played this game and aren't familiar with the universe it takes place in, you may miss a bit of it's fun. Even if you're not a Warhammer geek however, this sports/combat game is well worth a look.Blood Bowl takes many elements from Rugby and American football and combines them with the brutal and violent Warhammer universe. The rules are much simpler than football, but at the end of the day, the goals are essentially the same; getting the ball into the enemy's endzone, and outlasting (quite literally) the opponent. Death and performance impacting injuries can and will happen at any time, and can easily result in a turning of the tides.You can play dirty and rely on injuries and special tactics to win, you can play passing and running games similar to traditional football, if you can consistently withstand the enemy, you can just run the clock out. Creativity is key in a game with so few rules! Not too much of a learning curve, well worth the reward. The few cons are notable. There are definitely balance problems between the races, especially when starting a brand new campaign. It may be difficult to find opponents in multiplayer without joining a league, and you should be ready to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked a lot. Blood Bowl is also notorious for random crashes, and Chaos Edition is no exception. It's worse for some than others, so make sure to save after each game.All in all, if you're looking for a game that blends sports and hand to hand combat together, and can't afford/run Blood Bowl II, look no further. Highly recommended!			"

												Blood Bowl makes American Football look like a pillow fight. The turn based strategy football game features fantasy teams based on the Warhammer franchise. The game will make you happy to see a beloved board game played on your computer against anyone in the world as well as angry as the dice screws you over. I played online with my dwarf team and made an amazing pass rolling a 6 for the launch and a 5 for the catch only to directly after roll a 1 whilst Going for it and then re-roll a 1 making my player fall instead of scoring. The game is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone, especially those who have friends playing it. Making an online league between friends will give you a thrilling experience as you kill your best friends star player and scores the winning touchdown. The game is very good, although it is quite slow paced and can get boring if you're not really psyched to play. It is not a game I recommend for ""I have nothing to do"" gaming since the games are long and can get quite dull. But when you are in the mood for som Blood Bowl, this game will enlighten your day and waste your hours when you should be working.7/10			"

While i cant speak for the multiplayer as i have not done as much of it as i would like, The single player i find is great for testing out teams and learnin how you like to play , Do you wana beat the other team to death then score when they have no more players? or do you want to outrun or pass around the team and keep your guys safe. You can have all kinds of plots and plans each game ends up different because of the dice rolls (though they seem to favor the elves *shake fist*) :P all in all a great fun game ive spent quite a bit of time in compared to some 40 to 60 dollar titles i have definately a great game all around			"

												If you enjoy strategy games and/or Games Workshop you won't regret getting Blood Bowl.It wonderfully combines the complex strategy and ridiculous silliness inherent in many Games Workshop creations. It is easy enough to pick up straight away, but the complexity will have you coming back for more. The sheer blind luck of dice-rolling adds to the fun, brutally adding in the element of chance which can scupper your best-laid plans. All in all, yes. Buy it. It's a laugh.			"

												If you've never played this game and aren't familiar with the universe it takes place in, you may miss a bit of it's fun. Even if you're not a Warhammer geek however, this sports/combat game is well worth a look.Blood Bowl takes many elements from Rugby and American football and combines them with the brutal and violent Warhammer universe. The rules are much simpler than football, but at the end of the day, the goals are essentially the same; getting the ball into the enemy's endzone, and outlasting (quite literally) the opponent. Death and performance impacting injuries can and will happen at any time, and can easily result in a turning of the tides.You can play dirty and rely on injuries and special tactics to win, you can play passing and running games similar to traditional football, if you can consistently withstand the enemy, you can just run the clock out. Creativity is key in a game with so few rules! Not too much of a learning curve, well worth the reward. The few cons are notable. There are definitely balance problems between the races, especially when starting a brand new campaign. It may be difficult to find opponents in multiplayer without joining a league, and you should be ready to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked a lot. Blood Bowl is also notorious for random crashes, and Chaos Edition is no exception. It's worse for some than others, so make sure to save after each game.All in all, if you're looking for a game that blends sports and hand to hand combat together, and can't afford/run Blood Bowl II, look no further. Highly recommended!			"

												As I write this review Blood Bowl II is newly published so in time this review may go out of date...I have to warn you beforehand that this game might not suit a... say TBS lovers since this is not a true turn based ""grand"" strategy, or sports game fans since this is indeed a turn based game... well this also involves a ball, that you have to carry to the touchline to score a touchdown. So this is in essence a turn based football-ish game that includes a hefty chunk of violence, touchdown rushes and razzle dazzle passes, brutal blocks, blitz actions that will injure, gut, break and from time to time kill the opponent... Yes death is a part of this game and death is permanent... well as all deaths are...In the time being I have to recommend this version instead of BB2, altough BB2 offers better visuals, BBCE offers more races to play, altough the visuals are not good, they are not bad either.And one more teeny tiny thing, if you consider yourself an unlucky person, the RNG, or the diceroll of this game may make you go insane and think that the dices are rigged :) believe me I wish they were but they are not :)Another thing to mention is if you are new to Blood Bowl, make sure you watch some of the great tutorial videos on YouTube in order to grasp the basics, I've never tried the tutorial of this game however I've heard that it's not great... Pros:Fun game with a lot of variety and fun, not to mention a pretty much alive Online community as wellCons:Not for everyone, certainly not for casuals, maybe dated graphics (which is not a con for me personally)All in all a great mish mash of violence, blood, ball and goblins :)			"

												First of all! I'm recommending this game, but don't jump into it. The board game it's based on is awesome and real fun, but many things could have been done better in the computer version. If you get it on sale as I did, it can be a great purchase, especially if you want to play against other players, but be warned if you're a fan of the board game, because it may not live to your expectations.Pros+ Almost identical set of rules taken from the board game. Which is an awesome game, really, unless you keep rolling ones and skulls+ Adapts lots of teams from the original game+ Multiplayer gives it some flavour+ Fun game that mixes sports and fantasy strategic roleplay... and it worksCons- You'll want those guys to shut up after a couple of games- Can be frustrating sometimes- Dice are crueler than your average greek god- Single player gets boring after a while- AI is not the smartest tool in the shed, to be honest- Too expensive, considering BB2 is here			"

												I am a long time fan of BB and Games Workshop generally. The concept of BB and its universe is so rich that this should have been an amazing game BUT Cyanide got the licence to develop the game and, unfortunately, they butchered it, initially.  Whilst the initial release of this game was horrible, after several years/patches/upgrades, it is now very enjoyable 7.5/10. The interface and UI are still terrible, but you will get used to it. And the graphics now look pretty dated compared to BB2, but dont let that put you off.  This is an infinitely better game than BB2, which Cyanide is doing its best job to butcher, again.Buy this if you like a bit of a tactical level up grind'fest.Dont buy this if you are a bad loser - the random number generated (RNG) dice rolls do feel somewhat 'rigged' against you sometimes.....

												I think maybe some of you are hesitating about this game, so let me say this: This game is great. I guarantee that you will at the very least feel you have got your money's worth. Me i love this game. It is a turn and probability based football game with fantasy races, how fresh is that? AND, there's like 15 or 20 different races to choose from! And here's the trick, you can move every player you have, on your turn, but as soon as you fail one action, your turn is OVER! The balance of strategy and chance is, in my opinion just right. Just like XCOM. In short, you should get this game and then play with me online.			"

												This game is terrible at explaining mechanics. That point aside, it is fun. It is ""fantasy football"" as it should be. Contrarily to Madden, this game plays out in a turn based fashion. It does have a real-time mode; but it's rubbish and is not the main draw of the game. There's alot of strategy involved in this game; and reminds me of chess in how it's structured in some ways. It's fun, but is pretty niche in terms of who'd enjoy it. Hell, I don't even like actual football, but playing out a match in this game is still fun besides. If there's a demo available for this game I'd try it out first before dropping any cash on Blood Bowl.			"

												Blood Bowl. Oh you. A turn-based RTS game inspired by american football, but with fantasy races and extra violence. Want to see a game of Werewolves vs Orks? How about Elves vs Dwarves? Just another day in Bloodbowl.The game, like its tabletop equivalent, is centered entirely around six-sided die rolls to determine the results of actions. While many different strategies can be applied to win games (ranging from the ""long pass,"" the ""passing train,"" or ""KILL THEM ALL"") and you'll surely find one suited to your style. The factions are diverse and the differences between them are meaningful, leading to a fun experience where you'll want to try out every faction, just to see what it's like!That being said, the game is very unforgiving. On a six-sided die, you will roll a surprising amount of fails. While this is just a part of the game, it's can be quite frustrating to new players, and there is a definite learning curve that one has to get past before you can really appreciate the depth of the game. Another thing that can be quite frustrating is that players from your team (and the enemy team) can get injured, sometimes permanently, which in tournaments can be devastating. Still, it's all part of the game, and you'll surely learn to love it as i did!If you love turn-based RTS games, or have a macabre fantasy of ""what would football be like if it was extra violent?"" then this is definitely a ""must try.""

												Although this is a fun game, it is NOT worth thirty dollars. Wait for a sale, this is a ten dollars game, in my opinion, although companies will always value themselves higher. The product itself is only worth ten dollars though because there is a definite learning curve, if you've never played Blood Bowl (which feels like a chore having to adapt to) and it's just not a game that keeps me coming back like a Crusader Kings 2 or Total War game would. I rarely play this game, although when I do, I usually do have a long session with it. Once you get the hang of this game, there is a strategic experience to it like in Total War where I have to attack enemies from the side or block certain people from advancing so they don't score. It isn't as fun though unless you're playing as a team like the Orcs who can just clothesline an entire team of Elves. I highly recconmend playing as the Orcs if you're a beginner because they're so strong and they're very reliable. They also cause the other team far more injuries or even deaths than you'll sustain so at the very least, if you lose, they'll be in the hospital for the next morning, sipping through a straw because their jaw is broken (another person is holding the cup because their arms are also broken), while attending the funeral of their fallen Elf teammate who tripped and died on his own without being touched by anyone (that actually can happen in this game and it is hilarious). I have a serious problem with the format of the Blood Bowl though. Here's my proposal. Watch the show Battle Bots and that's how the Blood Bowl should go. You should just pick a race and not have to worry about building a solid team because you already start out with the best since they're represting their race and then from there, you play a starting match like a preseason to rank the teams and sort out who's the strongest and then from there, you make a thrity two team braceket that the player can view where the #1 ranked team faces the #32 ranked team and #1-4 are all in different sections of the bracket (look up the Battle Bots bracket) and then from there all the teams play (the player can just watch games if they want) and as soon as the bracket starts, if you lose, you're out, until only two teams stand. This game is the Blood Bowl and it will take place in a huge arena with a huge audience. The winner will then be awarded a blood bowl trophy with a roman numeral on it to symbolize what bowl it is. This would be a way more enjoyable and competitive experience. Lastly, my final criticism is that there are not enough turns in a half. Not even close. At most, with the Orcs, who're a very physcial team, you'll get two points in a game and that's only because you returned a fumble for a touchdown. I've had far too many games end 1-0 because I stopped them from scoring but they couldn't stop me in my half. The small amount of turns really does cripple the experience.			"

												Just a heads up other than teaching you the basic controls of the game the tutorial is pretty much useless.  Check out the community guides to help you fill in the blanks.Ok so I typically hate sport games fantasy football with orcs and dwarves has actually turned out to be really fun. There is a bit of a steep learning curve,  and the dice rolls will sometimes make you pull your hair out, but when the perfect play pans out perfectly and you score that touchdown... victory has never been so sweet.

												I got to this game a little late in it's overall lifecycle.  The concept is fun and it is a great adaptation of an excellent board game, but at this point in it's lifespan the multiplayer is hard to get into as well as being rife with bugs and possible exploits that are never going to be fixed.  The single player can be very entertaining, but the AI is inconsistent, to put it mildly.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough. There are three major events that have scarred me forever that I think sum this game up:1. My max level wood elf with AGI 6 and sure feet killing himself when going for it despite my team reroll.2. Learning that Tackle was a thing when playing as the skaven.3. Playing as Chaos and just trying to table my opponent.This is the best turn-based sports simulator money can buy.			"

												Not bad, and I'm glad they fixed the bugs that plagued the console version (including skill dropping from player profiles, which was awful...)Very faithful to the boardgame, and the Blitz game variant is an interesting (if not particularly engaging) variation, which plays more like a popular series of American Football video games.A few things could certainly be improved on, and might affect your enjoyment of this game, so be aware:* Although injuries, including death, are permanent for your team, they mean absolutely nothing to the computer teams, which return to their starting condition after every single match. That gets a little old after a while. There's no sense of permancy other than on your side of the pitch, and it makes it tempting to rely on ""save-scumming"" to get through tricky matches.* I would vastly prefer a way to choose exactly which teams are 'legal' - even if it was just a way to pick which of the expansion teams were included rather than the current all-or-nothing approach. Be prepared for constant, tedious battles with Khemri...* If playing a solo game, the computer continually spams pathetic 'smack talk' style messages at you in chat, which do nothing to aid immersion but reveal rather more about what the developers think of you as a person (or what kind of person they think plays their game).Those annoyances aside, it's really not a bad game at all.

												A flawed game that could have benifited from more support via patches from the developer. Awful AI, dice rolls that cannot be believed and even the simplest thing (putting petty cash into inducements) does not work although it asks you how much you want to put in. Cyanide couldn't be bothered to fix this (or even simpler remove the feature if you can't get it to work). I play the Tabletop version of this with great regularity and this game is a travesty that would encourage new players to the game to quit in disgust and never consider the tabletop version. If this last sentence describes you I implore you to check out Ausbowl and find your nearest group because this game does not do it justice.			"

												This game taught me how to make friends, and then how to lose them very quickly. Great turn based strategy of a mix between american ""football"" and fantasy warhammer. Bit complicated and frustrating at the start but does get more fun providing you take the game in its stride even if the dice seem against you. Also you might want to turn the commentators off after a while, the amount of times iv heard about the heroes of lorne and big moot sandwhiches is insane. If you can get this on sale its a steal.

												Working again without any action on my part.  GG. 3-30-17Got to play for 22 hours with no problems yet now BB fails to load at all.  Just a generic Windows error message saying the program encountered an error and shuts down.  I've already uninstalled, reinstalled, verified files and gone through countless online help files.  Nothing has changed on my PC so until I can get some explination why BB worked and now doesn't, this gets a thumbs down.  Wanting to play and being unable to is more frustrating than the dice rolls.			"

												Although this is a fun game, it is NOT worth thirty dollars. Wait for a sale, this is a ten dollars game, in my opinion, although companies will always value themselves higher. The product itself is only worth ten dollars though because there is a definite learning curve, if you've never played Blood Bowl (which feels like a chore having to adapt to) and it's just not a game that keeps me coming back like a Crusader Kings 2 or Total War game would. I rarely play this game, although when I do, I usually do have a long session with it. Once you get the hang of this game, there is a strategic experience to it like in Total War where I have to attack enemies from the side or block certain people from advancing so they don't score. It isn't as fun though unless you're playing as a team like the Orcs who can just clothesline an entire team of Elves. I highly recconmend playing as the Orcs if you're a beginner because they're so strong and they're very reliable. They also cause the other team far more injuries or even deaths than you'll sustain so at the very least, if you lose, they'll be in the hospital for the next morning, sipping through a straw because their jaw is broken (another person is holding the cup because their arms are also broken), while attending the funeral of their fallen Elf teammate who tripped and died on his own without being touched by anyone (that actually can happen in this game and it is hilarious). I have a serious problem with the format of the Blood Bowl though. Here's my proposal. Watch the show Battle Bots and that's how the Blood Bowl should go. You should just pick a race and not have to worry about building a solid team because you already start out with the best since they're represting their race and then from there, you play a starting match like a preseason to rank the teams and sort out who's the strongest and then from there, you make a thrity two team braceket that the player can view where the #1 ranked team faces the #32 ranked team and #1-4 are all in different sections of the bracket (look up the Battle Bots bracket) and then from there all the teams play (the player can just watch games if they want) and as soon as the bracket starts, if you lose, you're out, until only two teams stand. This game is the Blood Bowl and it will take place in a huge arena with a huge audience. The winner will then be awarded a blood bowl trophy with a roman numeral on it to symbolize what bowl it is. This would be a way more enjoyable and competitive experience. Lastly, my final criticism is that there are not enough turns in a half. Not even close. At most, with the Orcs, who're a very physcial team, you'll get two points in a game and that's only because you returned a fumble for a touchdown. I've had far too many games end 1-0 because I stopped them from scoring but they couldn't stop me in my half. The small amount of turns really does cripple the experience.			"

												This game should be a great time for both American Football fans and board game fans alike. It's a game that basically marries the two aspects together and cranks up the violence knob to 11. If you do decide to play online with strangers (and you're new to Blood Bowl), be prepared to lose. The game is rather unforgiving and it takes a certain mindset to really understand all the rules that are going on behind the scenes. Once you start to pick it up, though, it's loads of fun.			"
