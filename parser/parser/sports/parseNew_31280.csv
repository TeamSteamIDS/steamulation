												Poker Night at the Inventory is a Poker game made by Telltale Games. It is available for €4 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night at the Inventory allows you to play Texas Hold'em with Max, Strong Bad, Tycho and the Heavy.So what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. A Characters will sometimes use an item to play. If you beat that character, you will get that item in Team Fortress 2! While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!Verdict--------This game offers a lot of fun for just €4. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!This game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want all unlockable items you can be found at the Inventory for 50 hours.Score: 81/100			"

People only play this for TF2 stuff2. Even though multiplayer is out of Telltale's reach, it would have been a fantastic feature3.

												A decent hold'em poker game, where you can win four items of Team Fortress 2 game (which is not of any interest for me) and listen a hilarious in-game chat of 4 fun characters: Max from Sam & Max series, Strong Bad from Homestar runner, Heavy from already named Tea Fortress and Tycho from Penny-Arcade(dotcom). All of them are lovable. It could be very relaxing, dealing cards, and listen idle, yet clever chat of those four. For some time, at least.Game have only one downside: once you heard all the lines characters were going to say... and win all 4 items from them... it is getting bleaker. Losing colours and taste. And if you're an achievement hunter... well, I wish you the best of luck. Achievements in the Poker Night are very logical and good ones, but some of them are connected to winning the hand with certain combination. And yeah, to made complete of this game, you need to get a straight flash.Well, again, good sides:1) Proper, enjoying poker. If you set difficult level at hard, it will be quite challenging. No, you'll not win every hand with all-in tactic, like some other reviews said. You gotta try to be a good player. A cool and smart one.2) Not only you'll be playing poker with worthy opponents, but they'll be entertaining you in the process! And every of them has a different behavior, which you'll need to learn for make sure you're winning.3) From those of us who are playing Team Fortress, the items you'll win should be a good reward to play a night or two in poker.Bad sides:1) No matter how clever and fun are the lines from all four your opponents, they are limited. And after you heard them all, in all combinations... it is not so fun anymore. And even beyond that point, sometimes, there are lines which feels out of order. Like when Heavy guy is folding cards before you, and then starting to banter you with something like ""In Mother Russia you're quit when you're dead"". C'mon, man, you're folded too!2) So the game wears off... but if you want it with complete achievements, you need damned staright flush! And that's a bummer. Chances to get that combination... not high.3) Finally, there are some stabilty issues, especially when you're trying to change skins of background. So after several attempts to change something, I decided to stick to the main theme, the reason of stability.I have two marks: ""Khorosho!"" (8/10) if you are playing for the items and not for long. And 7/10 - if you're collecting achievements and getting bored with all those repeating lines again and again.			"

												+ Visually appealing+ Funny dialogue, but gets repetative after a while+ Unlocks add incentive to play- Predictable AI is too easyEver wanted to listen to some of your favorite video game and internet characters say kinda funny things to each other while you play a basic poker game? Maybe? Well maybe you should give Poker Night at the Inventory a try. Naturally, the addition of character antics slows the game down quite a bit, so if you want to really play poker, this game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Additionally, the character AI is very predictable after you've played for a bit. Tycho is conservative, Heavy is aggressive, Strong Bad likes to bluff, and Max is aggressive to the point of stupidity. Once you learn their tendencies and tells, the game becomes very easy.It's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of it. Good thing they made another one!73/100A great poker game for people who don't really play poker. Worth about 2 bucks at this point.			"

												Too bad tf2 items are the main reason many people are buying this game and, what's worse, most of these people don't even play it, they use cheats to unlock achievements to get their tf2 items.This game is surely entertaining even if you don't play tf2 and if you don't know any of these characters.Their dialogues and voice comments are still pretty funny and poker overall is pretty interesting game, of course if you bother to learn at least the basics of it before you start playing.Even losing in this game feels good, it's just a friendly game with interesting characters where there are fake money at stake.Better use this instead of gambling your real money, you know.And use the saved money to buy more tf2 items.Requested: list of tf2 items you can get from this game.[wiki.teamfortress.com] "

												If you're looking for some long story about how Sam, Tycho, the Heavy and Strong Bad all ended up playing poker ... well, there's not much of one. It's just the four of them hanging out and playing at The Inventory, an underground club that supposedly has its roots in Prohibiton, but offers nothing more than a setting. And that's fine, because really, this game doesn't have a need for a story. Visually, Poker Night's a good looking game. The Heavy, Strong Bad and Max all use models from Valve and Telltale's games, respectively, and their animations are very smooth. Tycho's model, on the other hand, is brand-new, and oddly enough, he's the one who looks a little out of place from time to time. There's also a few graphical glitches if you move the game along too fast: in one instance, I couldn't see my cards for an entire hand because they never actually loaded. I'd folded too quickly and skipped to the end of the hand before the game could make the change, it seems. Another cool little feature is that in the background, the characters will appear as you knock them out of the game. They don't do a whole lot, but it's kind of cool to see Strong Bad playing the arcade machine, or the Heavy at the bar after a bitter defeat at the table.Where Poker Night excels, though, is in the chatter at the table between the Heavy, Tycho, Strong Bad and Max. The scritping and the actual voice acting itself is spot-on, a testament to the abilities of whoever's responsible at Telltale for writing this game's dialogue. Tycho's voice is a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it the more you play, until it seems natural. What's also great is that each character's quirks are also included in their dialogue: for example, there are Heavy's ""funny"" stories about summer camp that are actually quite morbid, and Tycho's obsession/lust over giraffes makes it into the game, the latter of which made me laugh out loud the first time I heard it. In short, they've nailed the spirit of all four characters perfectly. My only complaint is that they engage each other, but never really bring the player into their conversations. You kind of feel more like an invisible observer than a player at the table with these guys for the bulk of the experience. Outside of their clever quips, the actual computer players seem... well, I'm not sure how to describe them. Maybe a bit erratic? At times, they seem to take unnecessarily big risks or make strange plays, like going almost all in and folding. At other times, the AI seems to know exactly what the flop, turn and river cards are going to be ahead of time, and is able to make strong bets based on that knowledge. I know part of poker is that the game can turn on its head with the draw of the right card and make a winning hand a losing one. But in Poker Night, it feels like those sudden moments are, at times, manufactured by the game more than they would occur naturally. Poker Night's gameplay pretty much boils down to good ol' fashioned Texas Hold 'Em, the kind you see on TV. It helps a bit if you know what beats what ahead of playing this game, as it makes it easier to gamble, but you can definitely pick up how to play over time. Navigating the in-game interface to make calls, raises and folds is relatively simple. Plus, in addition to the new items, winning games unlocks new tables and decks to play with, giving you the opportunity to customize the game's look a little bit.On the downside, there's not a whole lot else you can change. The AI has two difficulty options - normal and hard - and you can adjust the level of conversation that goes on as well as if it’s censored or not. But you can’t change anything about how much the buy-in is, presumably to keep people from somehow gaming the system to get the Team Fortress 2 items easily, what blinds start at, etc. Maybe adding in a few other options that unlocked once you had all of the items would have helped keep some replay value. All this boils down to Poker Night's biggest problem: it gets repetitive very quickly. Once you've heard Tycho and Heavy's tenth Class discussion for the twentieth time, it loses a lot of its initial charm. On top of that, with no real options to modify the game's stakes, you're always playing the same $10,000 buy-in game once you have the new Team Fortress 2 items. Thankfully, Telltale's included the option to right click through any conversation as a means of speeding up the game's pace and perhaps saving your sanity. The only bad part, of course, is right-clicking takes a lot of the fun out of the game because you're not getting those interactions anymore. In the end, for 4,99€, you can’t really go wrong, and this game delivers way more than the typical ultra-budget title. On top of all of the TF2 enhancements, you get the added fun of seeing some great characters in a funny setting. It's fun, it's cheap, and it gets you Team Fortress 2 upgrades while letting you play poker against a bunch of fun characters. It's a good game, even if you don't play TF2. The controls arent great and the poker isn't the best, but it's still a blast.			"

												Enjoyable as almost every other poker game, but not only that! With added features, including gameplay based reactions and story based informative conversations between your playmates-characters from other well known games, Poker Night at The Inventory genuily creates a feeling of a poker tournament played with your friend as if you were really there.You will hear a few entertaining and interesting dialogues at The Inventory club, sadly a lot not so interesting or exciting ones. After a while I clicked through the most of them just to let the game continue. Althought there are some precious and fitting ones. My favourite is this one said by Tycho, because I'm Czech and its nice to see we are not totally unknown to the world ""Checking is lame. Unless you are Czech. Which I would find amusing."".5.5 /10 Slightly above average "

												NOTE: TL;DR can be found in the bottom of this review. Whether you're looking for a review made in 1 paragragh or in a multitude of them, I hope you enjoy the review(s).Moving along...I decided to do a small review on Poker Night @ the Inventory. It's a simple concept made for a simple video game based on a (simple on paper) complex card game called Poker which everyone probably knows.If you don't... well... shame on you, because it's really f*ckin' fun! (Avoid real money bets though, there's a high chance you'll lose your car, dog, wife, house or kids with all the betting and stuff...)Anyways, Poker is nicely recreated in this video game format... mostly.You play against popular video game franchise characters, naming Max (from the Sam and Max series), Strong Bad (I have no idea), Heavy Weapons Guy (from TF2) and that's it...The dialogue is well done, it's funny at times and it keeps the mood going without boring you. The fact that the AI is solid for the most part also helps a lot. However, after a couple of hours, the dialogue WILL repeat itself over and over, making you skip it constantly after 3 hours of play, which isn't very good, as you can probably tell.The gameplay is basic poker, you got your flushes, straights (and hom... bad joke, sorry), full houses (which you won't have if you play on casinos, more like ""empty houses"" hahaha, get it?! God, what's wrong with me?), two-pairs, your classic ""poker"" and more...Everything plays as it should... like a poker game...There is one thing lacking though... and that is the possibility to bluff.You can bluff, sure. I mean I did go ""All-In"" when everything I had was a ""pair of twos"" or an ""Ace-High"" and all the AI ended up folding. Bunch of chicken ♥♥♥♥♥...Anyways, it felt like luck more than anything else, bluffing is supposed to make you feel good, you can trick people into thinking you have a full poker of Aces when in fact, you only possess a joker and a Magic: The Gathering card. Where do you think the expression ""Poker Face"" comes from? Exactly...The lack of a bluff system (which no poker video game can ever do, I think... maybe ""Next-Gen"" can fix that, LOL!) takes away a bit of the strategy of the game. However, it's enough to make the game fun enough to play, to listen to the characters talk (Heavy and Max are awesome, Strong Bad came to me as annoying) and to generally, have a good time!And I had indeed, a good time! Even the luck felt PERFECTLY balanced to either f*ck me, or f*ck one (or more) of the opponents, not too unfair or fair for me. I actually remember ending up the very first round of the match going All-In alongside 2 other characters, which was hilarious!********************************TL;DR**************************************I'm dragging a bit here, so, sorry. Anyways, funny dialogue that can get repetitive after a while (but that's expected), nicely balanced luck (in my case), basic poker gameplay, nothing special to talk about the gameplay. And finally, you get TF2 stuff! Only problems I had were related to frustrating luck (some matches in a row just weren't clicking for me) and the lack of bluffing (quite impossible in video game format). OH! AND NO MULTIPLAYER!!!! WTF, TELLTALE?!So overall, I had fun. The game costs (only) 3,99€, on sale, you can get it for 0,99€ or even less! It's a perfect game to spend your time in work breaks (lengthier matches won't last more than ~45 minutes (and even that's pushing it!)).The obligatory gaming industry scoring system for Poker Night @ the Inventory is an arbitrarily pointless 8/10.Small review my♥♥♥♥♥ Ugh!

""I AM SORRY. I DO NOT HAVE THIS MONEY... I DID, BUT SASHA HAS BEEN VERY GOOD LATELY, AND I WANTED TO GET HER GIFTS. THE MONEY IS GONE. I HAVE NO CHOICE...""Telltale Games - these dudes got it in their name. They're able to put some kind of story even into the poker based game. Isn't that awesome? Instead of basic poker game with just table and cards on table, no dialogues, annoying dealer and just that feeling when the only thing you are focusing on are the cards, Poker Night at the Inventory make you feel that you're really part of the game, part of the table and fellas around you are ""real"". Graphics are just awesome, dialogues are very very very-well written, your company is well-choosen. Most probably it'll get repetetive after 100/200 hands but when you play for special items, it really freshen up the gameplay. Dialogues are also very repetetive after while, but they are so great, that possibility it gets annoying for you is very low.After few hours in, when you win all the items, and fully enjoy it and all you want to to before uninstalling the game is 100% achievements, the fact that few of them are luck based really ruin the day for you. Getting Straight Flush or Quads is really rare. Me myself, I got Quads twice and Straight Flush once. It's random algorithm so some of you may get Straight Flush even at the start of your very first hand.This game cost 4,99 dollars, during sale 0,99. If we take into consideration, what kind of stupid and bad games are there available for way more than that, 0,99 is absolutely nothing and don't even think twice about it. Same goes with Poker Night at the Inventory 2.However, Governor of Poker 2 is better game for me, as it was that thing which brought me into real-life and online poker. Hopefully I'll do review for GoP2 soon, and I fully recommend you those three games if you're fan of poker!Bonus Point: Strong BadRating: 7/10 "

												I am recommending this game solely for the humor between the various characters in it - they are, for the most part, witty and original, and their nicknames for eachother are great (Heavy calls Strongbad ""Tiny Heavy"", during some great moments). The only character I was very whatever about was Tycho, he comes off as a pompous annoying know-it-all, but it only gives the others an opportunity to crack wise at his expense. The actual gamepay should be simple enough right? No. The poker mechanics are horrendous. On occassion you will find that a pair of whatevers will beat a flush, or any other weird combination. The actual gameplay has been riddled with bugs like this since release, and that was several years ago. This is the major downside to this game, but the humor completely makes it worth it nonetheless.Another minor downside, if you can even call it that, is that the achievements are moronic. One achievement asks you to get a straight flush, the probability of getting that in Texas Hold 'Em ""is approximately 0.0311% (0.0032% for royal flush and 0.0279% for non-royal straight flush)"". Other such achievements include ""Get a hand with 3 kings"", ""Get 4 of a kind"", and so on. While sure, getting these cards would be quite an achievement, it is still a major nuisance if it is the only achievement you lack from having 100% of the achievements - even for someone (like myself) who does not strive for 100%'ing achievements, lacking that ONE achievement would make anyone want to go for it.Nonetheless, game is recommended still, it is very funny and witty, and makes for a great pastime.

Everything is better with a group of friends!Everyone knows doing pretty much anything feels more fun with a group of frineds, or even just with fun and friendly people. And that's how Poker Night at the Inventory feels like!The players in Poker Night at the Inventory may not be the most friendly ones but they certainly are fun to listen to. You are placed in a poker table with Max from Sam & max, Heavy from Team Fortress 2, Tycho from Penny Arcade and Strong Bads from Homestar Runner. If you are familiar with these names you may notice that they aren't the most friendly faces but that doesn't mean it'd be annoying or unfun to listen to them while they're babbling about random stuff.Aside from the funny dialogue theres not much going on with the game. It's Texas Hold'em with colorful characters and neat graphics. It's basic yet fun. If you are fan of Texas Hold'em and video games you will most likely enjoy this game.One of the main selling points for this game are the rewards your opponents can place as a bet if they don't have enough cash with them. If you win them in a hand and they run out of cash you will get rewarded with their unique item they just bet in. You will be awarded with an Achievement and an in-game item for Team Fortress 2. If you are not a fan of Team Fortress 2 the rewards will be quite useless.Poker Night at the Inventory is a fine game. It may not be the most polished one but it holds up as a Texas Hold'em game very well. It has unique style and fun characters and is a game that feels fun to jump into a match of Hold'em while listening to them talk. If you get annoyed of them or you've heard all of their jokes million times you can always mute them. So if you are looking for a solid Texas Hold'em game with some chracter this is just the right game for you. Although if you are not familiar with video game culture you may not understand any of the jokes since they pretty much revolve around the characters and their universes.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												So, Poker Night At The Inventory, the game where you play Texas Hold'em with a rabbit, 2 out-of-the-ordinary people, and... whatever the hell Strong Bad isSeriously though, this game is amazing, I absolutely love it.I assume the majority of us got this game for the tf2 items. If you are one of those people, or you're a fan of Sam & Max,  Homestar Runner, the Penny Arcade webcomics, or a poker player in general, I'd recommend this game to you in a heartbeat.The story is as simple as who you play as: you are known as ""The Player"", a silent poker player who's arrived at the inventory to play poker with 4 other fellows. The Inventory is a secret poker place hidden from society in case those ""in charge"" decide to essentially ban Poker for a second time.There you have it, that's the story: Nothing more, nothing less is known about you; the rest is playing some number of games of Texas Hold'em with the Heavy (tf2), Sam (Sam & Max), Strong Bad (Homestar Runner), and Tycho (Penny Arcade webcomics) for stakes of $10k.Now onto the aspects of the game:Graphics [9/10] - The graphics are their own personality, likewise the characters' models match their respective traitsAssets [7.8/10] - I run a fairly average computer with a lot of memory left, yet I run at somewhere between 30-40 fps ingameAI [9.8/10] - The ai of the game is, I feel, unbelievably realisticSoundtrack [10/10] - The soundtrack is stupendous, I love it: I listen to this whenever I need think music playingAtmosphere [10/10] - Between the soundtrack, the dialouge from the characters, the game looks and feels amazing and almost believable to be sitting down playing poker with these charactersOverall score [8.7/10] - The big killer for me was the fact that the second game runs much more smoother, despite having more stuff going on: other than that, this game would've gottten a 9.6/10			"

However there are many achievements to unlock, items to collect and even free unlocks for Team Fortress 2.The witty dialogue between your opponants gives you immersion into their world and the background music, which I enjoy immensely, comforts you at the table.I've owned this game for many years and I still pop back for a round of cards with these chumps.

												If you're buying it for the character roster, get it- Listening to conversations about whether or not Max shtupt Mama Boscow or Heavy trying to get Strong Bad to join RED team is really enjoyable.If you're buying it for the TF2 items, get it*- As far as I know the weapons you can get from this game have been patched so that they are untradable. This is the only way to get them (but bare in mind you'll actually have play the game to earn them).* [ Don't take my word for it though. If you're a trader I wouldn't bother.]If you're buying it for the poker, don't bother-As far as I can tell, there are WAY better poker games on steam (quite a few I've seen that are worth less) so if you want to play poker, get one of those instead.That's my view of the game, but you should probably check some other reviews first. My experience of the game is pretty limited, so you might to look at some reviews that are better than mine (which is all of them). There. I've shut up now. Thanks for reading			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun distraction, but I felt the only reason I had any emotional investment in it is that I wanted to win the Team Fortress 2 items which are only available through this game. This made me ask myself ""If I don't buy items in TF2, why did I buy this game to get some TF2 items?"" I suppose the answer is that I get to play a game in the process of obtaining those items, but the AI seems much too random in betting patterns to provide a truly enjoyable poker experience. Which means you are really just working to earn those TF2 items; and on top of that you have to pay money just for the privilege to work for them. I'd say buy this if you want to win the TF2 items, but if it's poker you're after there's surely better games out there. Or better yet just grab a real deck of cards and host your own poker night with your mates. 3 out of 10, would not bet.			"

												It's a freaking poker game. How can it not be more straight forward than that. The side conversations and the unlocks are nice. As it stands however. The game isn't all that great. For three simple reasons1) Facing the same characters over and over again. No multiplayer. And no ""DLC"" or ""extra content"" where you can switch out the other characters for brand new faces. While it is nice to hear the side conversations. It can get pretty old. Pretty fast.2) Luck. Now while this may sound dumb and stupid. There are instances where you might have a lousy hand, but! In some odd concidence you won. Outta nowhere! Where as the other card players could've easily beaten you. Now this might be a game mechanic or just sheer dumb luck. Whatever the case maybe this shouldn't be a thing.3) Weird A.I. Now, if this was against other players then the game might be more fun. But the A.I. in this game is weird, For example, and depending upon how lucky you are when you start a new tournament. The other card players might go all in. Outta nowhere! Which means if you got a great hand than the other opponents. You might actually win the game right away with no real sense of tension OR knock out half of the competition before the game can really progress anywhere.In the end Poker Night is a perfect game for Poker fans and achievement hunters. Yes, this game does have a tutorial and a cheat sheet to understand the 'card hands' and whatnot. But like what I stated; luck really runs the show in the game. If not then the weird A.I. does. If your an achievement hunter and a poker fan. This game might be up your alley. But for anyone else, you might want to pass.			"

This is much less serious, but I find that I actually enjoy it more for a short pickup game here and there.The game isn't exactly overflowing with content, achievements or deep progression but it also does not require an overflowing wallet to pick up.If you sometimes enjoy kicking back for 20-30 minutes and just playing an amusing round of Texas Hold'em then I would definitely consider adding this to your Steam Library!

												everybody loves gambling but no one wants to lose money, oh wait a sec. this game is for people who either know how to gamble and like it or people who want to learn how to gamble. In Poker night at the inventory you play the game texas holdem (gambling isnt poker poker is a seprate game so the name makes no sense) texas holdem is probably the simplest gambling game I know of, each player gets 2 cards and who ever gets the highest card combo wins. the charecters in this game is Strong bad who is by far the most ""up him self"" funny, Max, well I love max, I remember me and my friend playing sam and max save christmas together, it was challenging, hillarious and really run, tycho, I don't really know much about him so I cant quite say much about him, The Heavy, oh my god this beast of a man made it in to a underground cassino (how the hell?) this guy is off tf2, if you don't know what tf2, you are missing a big piece of your life. to conclude this review I would reccomend this game to as I said before: people who want to learn how to gamble and people who like playing gambling games. (a idea for poker night at the inventory pt.3 is please, please put in a multi player function)			"

												This game really shouldn't be listed as Mac-compatible when it doesn't work on any OS X version over 10.8. Basically the MAXIMUM OS you can be on is Lion. It's like saying the game is Windows-compatible, as long as you're on Vista or older.Only wasted a quid, thankfully. But definitely not impressed that I couldn't get past the tutorial cutscene to actually play the game because the devs just can't be bothered to update it.			"

AUDIOHilariousVISUALCobbled TogetherDIFFICULTYAverageVIBERelaxingCRAVINGPokerON SALEFrequentlyPROS: TF2 items seem to be the main reason many even bother with this, but it's a fun game on its own. Lots of deck and table options, some with cool on-screen effects. Bantering between characters is funny, it's interesting to watch this motley crew come together under one roof. CONS: Weirdly laggy during the beginning intro and generally not well optimized. No display for your current hand means a potential win may slip by. There is no way to completely silence the characters, making their more long-winded checks and folds annoying (especially after a long time playing.) Texas Hold 'Em only?? Where's seven-card stud!WORTH: As the best Poker game on steam currently, I believe this game is worth full-price. If you play TF2, you're going to get items for it, to boot!OVERALL: It's a shame people are brute-forcing this game for TF2 items and uninstalling.  You knuckle-draggers might've looked a little more distinguished after a few games of Poker. Like a monkey in a hat. Nevertheless, if you are having trouble getting all the items and achievements for this game, I have a comprehensive guide you can check out!SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Poker Night at the Inventory is a game developed and published by Telltale GamesThe game is visually appealing however there were some frame rate drops here and there sometimes. The game offers some funny dialogue but can get repetative after a while and the unlocks add incentive to continue playing the gameOne major flaw in Poker Night at the Inventory is the very predictable AI which makes the game too easyIt's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of itPoker Night at the Inventory is a great poker game for people who don't really play poker RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Much like my experience with Poker Night 2 I freely admit that I didn't have a lot of familiarity with the characters. I don't read Homestar Runner, Penny Arcade, or Sam & Max, and I don't play Team Fortress 2. Still, I feel like I've gotten to know all of them a little bit better through their table banter.Seems like it's become my pattern to play sequels before playing the first installments of any series. The absence of a dealer character in this game is jarring after coming from GLaDos, plus the purely cosmetic effects of Table and Deck themed skins felt a little light.Fun game but I must once again make a note of my hatred of luck-based Achievements. I need a Four of A Kind and a Straight Flush for my last two Achievements and it really sucks.			"

												It's good I guess. I played Poker Night 2 first and I felt bit spoiled here. You play with half the money then the sequel but you get to play with new characters at the same cost as the sequel. You play with Tyron (whoever the ♥♥♥♥ he is), The Heavy (Or Heavy Weapons Guy), Max and Strong Bad with the owner being the dealer which made me miss Glados as the dealer. I just miss her little insults she would make at you but to make up for it, it has a more friendly astmosphere to it. Instead of having Ash and Claptrap having a passive agressive talk with each other, You got The Heavy having a friendly talk with Max about his childhood which I like because it feels less compative and more a friendly match but with this, you get a lot more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This game is more unfair to you since I somehow got a flush which then gets beat by someone getting a royal flush out of  ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and when you finally got some money, its very little. I mean, I won a match with a royal flush and get $900 from the main pot while THE ♥♥♥♥ING HEAVY GETS $380000 FROM THE ♥♥♥♥ING SIDE POT WITH A PAIR OF 2s. THAT IS JUST SO MUCH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. You can change the difficulty which is a ♥♥♥♥ing lie since you are stuck to normal and you can't change jackshit. You can change the table conversations which yet again does jackshit and you have to turn on the strong langauge which is just so stupid. Hey Telltale, I'm playing Poker by myself in my room. I highly doubt I'm a 8 year old who can buy stuff from steam by myself.There is more to talk about but it's just more whining. I only recommend this if you like Poker Night 2 and want to see the characters and here more lines or want the poker version of Dark Souls.			"

												Here's my review for Poker night at the inventory.Let's begin shall weWell honestly not much to say about a game like this, its just mainly poker as the name suggests but with a few extras here and there.Gameplay wise its very well placed you are first welcomed with a nice introduction. Then the real game begins but its just poker as we know not much to say here but fully perfect at what it does.It is really addicting though now it makes me wanna play poker in real.Graphical options are many. On low still look pretty  considerable.Sound track well luckily its very good and catchy as well, makes poker fun in another way.Characters well some interesting one's here. you have heavy from (teamfortress 2) obviously. Max (the bunny) from sam and max. Strong bad from what i dont even know of actually. Lastly tycho from a comic or something.Now having all those characters really makes it into a interesting game, sometimes heavy tells you a story (though mostly hes sad awww). Max well the most least serious and mindless character here as when any of the other characters lose they always show angry faces while sam hes always cool. Strong bad well this is one angry fcker. And tycho well best way to describe him would be to say he always folds unless he has a very good set thus making it most harder to beat him.Promotional tf2 (teamfortress 2) and Borderlands 2 in-game items. A neat addition.Over all worth it?Surely if you are interested in a poker game at all this is worth a try. Good for tf2 items if you wanna get it alone just for that. A recommend game at only a price of $4.99 dollars fully worth its value.A poker game as the name suggests, well paced, polished,great ost,nice presentation and good graphics for its genre.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator "

												Cons:-Could have done so much more with the game to build off of a great themed poker idea to keep players entertained, unboard and replayability. -Got boring after the 5th tournament.  Same thing over and over and nothing new other than winning 4 in-game items that only TF2 new players would want as they have no items of real value to put into their slots.-Conversation settings need to be turned on High in the Options menu to get the most & best conversations in the game.Pros:-Cards randomization feels fairly accurate to real-life, something that almost all video games & poker sites stuggle with.-Cool poker themed game with a 'Rounder's NYC Feel.-With the conversation settings turned on high, surprisingly there are a lot of conversations where I didn't feel bored or even heard the same conversation twice in a full gaming session, and surprisingly colorful stories that was unexpected.-Has a nice optimization & action mechanics that's welcomed.-I waited a year until it went on a real sale and purchased it for $.80 cents for I & II.  Being 30 years old growing up during the arcade days, we spent like $10-$20 a day where that kind of money actually meant something of value, just on quarters in order to play 1 round on a arcade machine.  So I look at it as fair entertainment value for my money, even if i'll only play it once or twice in my life.  I knew this before purchasing it and decided to purchase it for the experience to see what it was all about and to say to myself I played it.If u get it on an amazing $1 sale then feel free to pick it up for the exp, but you can also pass on this game and not miss out on anything in this current gaming era.★★☆☆☆ Mediocre Game - 2/5 Stars			"

												I don't have much time playing this, but whenever I do boot it up it never ceases to be worth my time. Out of all the games, I guess that Poker Night is what puts me through a rollercoast of emotions the most. I get bummed out, I get super happy, I start getting cocky and then I am reminded of my humbleness by Heavy and his horseapple hand.What I most like about this game is that it has some things that few single-player poker games have: different AIs and bluffs. If you pay enough attention, you can figure out the different playstyles of your opponents, whether the hand is good or not for them and even if they are bluffing.And like every poker game, a lot of weird stuff happens here too. For example, this last tournament I was in: one of the hands consisted in a flush. On the table. Everybody gets a flush. YOU get a flush! And YOU get a flush!But I had the ace so I won the hand. On the same tournament, it was down to me and Max. Max had 500 dollars. I won with an ace high.Insane things like these is what makes Poker Night at the Inventory a remarkable card game, and if you love yourself some poker and you do not have the money to splurge on actual tournaments, I sincerely reccomend this to you. I bought it a couple of summer sales ago along with its sequel and ""Papers, Please"" for the grand total of 20 reais (about 10 dollars). Even if it's not summer sale, I'd say this game is worth its price.Some things that do upset me a little are the little sound bugs here and there, and sometimes it does freeze as if it is thinking. Also the mouse sensibility is stupendously weird and no matter how much I fiddle with the settings I can't get it to work normally. I guess my mouse will be drunk forever whenever I'm playing this game.Also, the subtitles censor the word t w a t. I don't find that upsetting, I just find it unnecessary.			"

												I will be brief. ""Poker Night"" is the kind of game you just wanna enjoy sitting back and playing. Sure it's unpleasant at times if these opponents pull a fast one on you and somehow come out on top with that River card out of nowhere, but other than having variable luck (mainly against your favor), it's a pretty fun game. Besides, there are times where the cards may go in your favor making your all-in bet not such a bad thing after all. There's amazingly cool graphics and wonderful dialogue to help add to the fun atmosphere. And the storyline behind this game is admittedly well-thought out.If you're a card gamer that enjoys some good Texas Hold 'Em, or if you're a guy who just loves to laugh along with some crazy, witty one-liners from pretty well-known gaming/comic/television celebrities, this game may be right up your alley. Or should I say right up your winning hand? :P			"

												Words cannot express how much hype I had when I first saw the trailer for this. All of the characters (except for Tycho, who I was honestly unfamiliar with at the time) together was just something so hard for me to process. I also somehow didn't expect it to actually be a poker game before release, so I had to learn it.Thankfully this game is pretty easy to handle once you get the feel for it. I think most sales honestly came from TF2, where you get some unlocks from this game. But I honestly find myself revisiting this every now and then just to hear all the characters talk to each other. Especially Strong Bad and Heavy, like TF2 and Homestar Runner together was a huge thing for me. Almost disappointing all classes couldn't wear the Dangeresque shades, but I still wore them proudly.Actually diving into it. Of course all the characters are amazing, granted you recognize them all. And it provides for some  amazing talk between them all (and you will eventually hear all the lines if you play it enough). You get rewarded (as said above) not only for TF2, but you can also unlock different tabletops and stuff. Granted you're good enough at poker unlike me. In the end, it's really just that. A well planned out and put together poker game with 4 very memorable characters all from different series.Unfortunately Poker Night 2 was an unfair mess that was truly annoying (at least in my opinion) and had sorta boring unlocks for TF2. Forgetting about that. If you wanna see Homestar Runner, Sam & Max, Penny Arcade, and the TF2 universe combined just to play a simple game of poker, this is definitely worth the $5.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun and surprisingly complex poker simulation. As someone who has pretty much no real experience with poker before playing this game, it's good at explaining the rules and immersing you into the game quickly and simply. There's that addictive quality of ""just one more round"", hoping to increase your balance, or to get the varied achievements or new items, that's a mark of quality in a turn-based game.But of course the real draw of Poker Night at the Inventory is the characters. If you're a fan of Homestar Runner, Team Fortress 2, Penny Arcade, or Sam & Max, or even if you aren't, the characters are going to make you laugh and come back for more. The dialogue is pretty fantastic, with all kinds of fun and dark humor (wait until you hear The Heavy's story about the Engineer). All of the characters fit well into their canon personalities, and even have playing styles that reflect them (e.g. Strong Bad likes to bluff and act all macho with large bets, so he can be vulnerable to called bluffs but is unpredictable about how good his hand really is). This is what really brings the immersion into the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who's interested in poker and/or the IPs involved in the game. It can give you hours of fun, laughs, and a decent challenge for a pretty low price.			"

												Poker Night is a single-player experience in which you compete in knockout style tournaments. Each player starts off with $10,000 as the buy-in, but on occasion they can barter and put an item of value up instead. If you can successfully knock out said player during the current tournament you will win their item.Poker Night earns top marks when it comes to character design and voice acting. The main cast looks like they've been pulled straight out of their game universe and are voiced by their original actors.The game is great for those looking for a laid back Poker experience. It also has achievements and can be found on sale quite often.7/10I nominated this for the custom award in the 2016 Autumn Sale as ""I'll Unlock That Achievement One Day"". I cry everytime.			"

												A reasonable implementation of a single player texas hold em game, with some mildly amusing banter from the eclectic players present to keep you interested for a while, although definitely in the realm of very casual poker players only.The main feature here is going to be the characters brought together in the game rather than the game itself, and it is fun and interesting for a while to see them interact within the confines of a poker game, and they do each represent a fairly distinct style of play (possibly too extreme) to mix things up and add interest to the gameplay, so whether you will like this game is likely to be based on whether you find the four chosen characters/personas interesting or not.One negative is that annoying last achievement to get a straight flush, lets just say unless you are very lucky the banter is going to feel very repetitive by the time you get it.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun little 5-ish hour game. It's funny, it is wickedly entertaining and features an interesting ensemble cast. However, like me, your most likely only buying it for the free TF2 exclusive items you can only get by playing this game.Which I dont condemn at all. By the time you've gotten all 5 you've pretty much seen everything in the game. I only played it for four hours and I have to say I got quite a lot out of my 5$.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun little 5-ish hour game. It's funny, it is wickedly entertaining and features an interesting ensemble cast. However, like me, your most likely only buying it for the free TF2 exclusive items you can only get by playing this game.Which I dont condemn at all. By the time you've gotten all 5 you've pretty much seen everything in the game. I only played it for four hours and I have to say I got quite a lot out of my 5$. But if your expecting something spectacular look elsewhere.			"

												From the creaters of the Sam and Max games, here comes Poker Night at the Inventory. The games setting is in a secret hideout known as The Inventory, where people from various medias hang out and play some poker games. You play Texas Hold Em and compete against Max from Sam and Max, Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner videos, Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Tycho from Penny Arcades and find out who will go big or go home. There's not too much to say about this game, it's just Texas Hold Em. Occasionaly someone will toss in a buy in if they are short on cash, being able to win the buy in will unlock an exclusive item in TF2 like Strong Bad's Dangeresque Too? Glasses and others. The dialouge between the players is always fun to watch after a hand. The conversations with Heavy and Tycho are funny as Heavy thinks Tycho is part of BLU Team as well as the ones with Strong Bad and Heavy and how Heavy finds him to be a smaller version of himself, or Tiny Heavy as he likes to call him. The one thing this game needs is Online play, it would be cool having more players in on the event or have them play as the multi-media characters. So in conclusion, Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun poker game where you don't have to waste realy money in order to play through the game. And since the game usually sells at $5.00 and features exclusive content in TF2, ya can't go wrong there.			"

												@poker recommendationsI would surely recommend this, if you like to play poker. Also this game makes you experience a lot, and it made my hearth beat when i putted al my money on the table. This game is good to play, also i love the story after it. It makes me go trough alot, if  your interested in pokering you should've bought this game. Also if you love to play the game ""Team Fortress 2"" you can buy it to win the items, it can be hard to win them so note that you need to know how pokering works. Or else it would be hard to win the story.			"

												Telltale bringings it trademark humor to the poker tables at an undisclosed location called ""the Inventory"" where renown characters from various franchises gather for a simple, friendly game of poker. For most, I believe, the fun comes from the characters and their dialogue along side the ability to unlock Team Fortress 2 items. However, from continous play the characters can be found repeating the same lines leaving the game to be nothing more than a standard computer-based poker game. But at least you can still play poker.			"

												Let’s face it; most people buy this game purely for the items you can earn for yourself on team fortress 2.If that really is the only reason why you are on the store page, then there are ways of getting those items relatively quickly.It took me around 3 hours to get all 4 of the items, and I personally don’t think that is too shabby, the AI in this game is pretty bad… and easy to manipulate, or at least that is what I thought. All I did was start up a game, if one of them puts their item up, great, carry on, if not… I restarted the game until one of them did. And from there, went all-in every hand in a complete gamble, because sometimes they call and you knock them out and get their item right there. You can do it any way you like, but if you are lazy like me and can’t be bothered, it’s a fairly easy way to “earn” those items. And hey hoe it only left me around $600,000 in debt.On the other hand, if you are looking at this game, not for the items, but for actual gameplay… there isn’t really much you can say, as mentioned before the AI in this game is terrible, it is repetitive and you can start to sus out patterns that the characters have. Their dialog you can tell is trying to be laid back, friendly chum-to-chum talk with one another, and in all fairness some of it is amusing… the first 5 times. The dialog is so frequent and repetitive that after a little while, I really started to get annoyed with what they were saying. I don’t play many poker type games with the gambling and whatnot, but the feel from the game isn’t what I would imagine a real person interested in poker would be looking for. It doesn’t feel like real poker… or a real game… it seems dumbed down.Now that I have gotten all the items, I really don’t think I will ever be playing this game again.  "

The conversations the characters have are hilarious, the game is fun, and the setting is pretty good! It's also helping me play poker. But anyway, I totally reccomend this game! It's just a short and sweet game about poker with some laughs and unlockables. It's enjoyable, so I recomend it. :)			"

												Ok now, you can't hide it and you don't have to, you, like most people out there bought this game for the TF2 items and well.... I did too. So why am i doing this review if the only thing i did was getting those bloody items? Simple, the game dragged me in more than it should've and i say it's pretty impressing for a poker game! The Dialogue is hilarious (and hilariously stupid sometimes) the graphics are....pretty, they're not the best but not the worst at all. And the gameplay it's kind of good for a little poker game (i actually learned quite a few things from this game) and the TF2 items are just the cherry on top of the cake, you should buy it now if you ever wanted to see Strong-Bad, Max, Heavy and Thyco in the same game..well, there ya go! This is the perfect game :3			"

												This game is precisely what it claims to be - poker with interesting characters that have amusing dialogue during play. Probably won't be enjoyable if you have zero interest in poker, but might be enjoyable if you like poker but are not familiar with the characters. It also has a guide to poker, so you don't need to be familiar with it, the game will teach you how to play.A few hours in, while some of the conversations are repeats, there's enough variety that it's still cool to listen to. I especially like the occasions when Strong Bad manages to get on Tycho's nerves. In general, Tycho has great lines, Strong Bad and Heavy are good, and Max... not so much.In terms of atmosphere, the visuals are good and consistent enough between the characters, and there's nice relaxing background music. Some of it sounds like a jazz-lounge version of the Team Fortress 2 music.Overall, I quite enjoy the game.			"

And it taught me how to play a new game of poker with entertaining dialouge from characters from your favorite games. Definitely should buy on sale and I would wholeheartedly reccommend for 4.99. Go play and see how good it is yourself. And thoes sweet demoman shades don't hurt at all. :)			"

												Has a couple of game-breaking bugs that really make this game not worth it. Random progress reset is widely reported, but no fix in sight. Also, the AI has random phrases that they say, and they quickly become very old. Even when selecting the lowest chat setting, they still have 15 second long rambling monologues every second time you fold or call, often twenty or thirty of the same phrases in the same poker game.

												Telltale Games Nice try...Well I love Texas Hold'em Poker and this was a decent try from Telltale Games. It's fun to cure boredom but that is mostly it, The comments from Max (Sam & Max), Strong Bad, Heavy Weapons Guy (TF2) and Tycho are funny as hell, but only for the first  2 tourneys, then you have heard them all about 20 times and you find yourself right clicking constantly to skip the chatter, Even setting the Chat settings lower doesn't seem to help. Also the game mechanics and AI poker skills aren't really steady , One game an AI will play super tight and the next tourney that same AI plays every hand and goes all in with cards like 5,8 Off suite before the flop... What I am getting at is that it's a fun game for when your internet is down and you are bored but don't buy it expecting it to be the WOSP.My Rating - 1/5			"

You will laugh at the pure insanity of Max, the egotistical Strong Bad, the unrealenting asshattery of Tycho, and the killing machince of TF2 that is which known as The Heavy.  There is different settings of which type of table talking banter you want to hear and different settings and skins of the tables and cards to some what switch to your likings.  The game is fun if you want to sit down and chill and just play a few hands of poker or just listen to a bunch of idiots ramble.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is, of course, a poker game. You play poker with some famous characters, two of which are from other Telltale games. I originally played this just to get the Team Fortress 2 items you can get from unlocking achievements in this game, but I enjoyed the dialogue between the characters so much that I continued to play even after I got them all. The dialogue will eventually repeat itself, but luckily if you get sick of it you can control how much the characters talk.

If you enable the swearing filter the comebacks and table chat is quality. You can also practice your poker skills on this game if your wanting to become a better player. If you play tf2 aswell you can get some exclusive items like lugermorph and lisence to maim.

												It's okay.  It doesn't take long for the dialog to get repetitive (though there is quite a lot of it, it doesn't take long to play a lot of hands).  As other reviews have noted, the players have patterns that come clear quickly, and their betting habits are unreasonable... raising triple the minimum bet with very little chance of getting better than a Queen high.  It kind of becomes unfun because some of the patterns seem to be trying to give you wins.As a TF2 player, but not a fan of the other franchises, I would have liked this more if it had been all TF2 characters.  It's interesting to see the Heavy while playing a card game.Honestly, I got it for the TF2 unlocks.  It's a fun game, but none of the AI seems very competitive, and the play becomes a bit dully repetitive about the time the dialog becomes repetitive.It's fun to play for awhile and worth it if you catch it on sale for less than $5.

												Poker Night at the Inventory was gifted to me by a good friend. I was unsure at first but excited when I recieved the gift as I did not know how to play poker but I knew once I learnt I could win prizes for Team Fortress 2! The first tournament I played, had me crowned the victor! Even though I was just guessing the rules and really didn't know what I was doing at all!When I started learning the game, I began to lose my winning streak and haven't actually won a tournament since! The characters at the table are very fun to play against, the Heavy is a favourite of mine as well as Max (Max inspired me to buy the entire 3 seasons of Sam and Max!). Though I did not know who Strong Bad was or Tycho, but it doesn't matter really... The conversations that the players have seem quite real, and I like how when someone is interrupted, they will continue their conversation by saying something like ""anyway"" or ""as I was saying"" which adds to the realisticness. The only real problem with the game so far is when Tycho occasionally has a spasm and moves around in his seat rapidly and sometimes when dialogue is repeated. I also like how when a player is busted out they can be seen in the background doing many different things!Poker Night at the Inventory is a decent casual game and I recommend it for fans of poker, Team Fortress 2, Sam and Max, whatever Strong Bad and Tycho are from and people who want to learn poker!

PresenationPoker Night at the Inventory isn't the most authentic and packed poker experience out there, mostly because it was never meant to be, but it is among the most enjoyable virtual poker experiences while it lasts. You will be simply known as the Player, a newcomer to the secret poker club known as the Inventory, taking part in five players tournaments against four memorable characters from different franchises, not only in the video games industry, but comics and video series as well. You will play against Max from Telltale's own Sam & Max franchise, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Tycho from Penny Arcade, and the Heavy from Team Fortress 2, characters that have absolutely nothing common, yet still manage to lighten up the mood at the poker table. Poker Night's magic comes from the conversation between those characters, which consists mostly of jokes and references, and while some were meant to be little easter eggs for fans of a particular franchise, most jokes appeal to a generic audience, making them hilarious even if you're not that familiar with the characters. A short introduction to each of your adversaries would've been welcome to familiarize the player with their background, but instead the game chooses to introduce them to you as you play via dialogue, which feels authentic to a poker experience, but ultimately falls short on how much information you will actually get. Nonetheless, the jokes are what make Poker Night at the Inventory a fun experience more than anything else, but unfortunately the amount of dialogue doesn't go on forever, and one or two hours in, the game will run out of new dialogue and start repeating itself over and over again.Rating: 6.5GameplayThere's no surprise or twist in here, what you actually play is poker, Texas Hold'em to be more specific, and that is another big reason why this game will become boring within a few hours; Texas Hold'em is the only thing you can play, and while it does work flawlessly and the game nails its table presentation, you will always play the same game, at the same location against the same adversaries, which does become boring quite easily. What will keep you playing, are the special items that each character will bring to the table as buy-in after a few rounds, giving you the opportunity to win them if you eliminate that character from the tournament; each character has one of those, making it four in total and winning those items will unlock them in Team Fortress 2, which is a nice thing if you play Team Fortress 2 as well. Even with that in mind, you can easily win those by playing a few tournaments which shouldn't take more than a few hours, and after that poker is the only thing that can bring you back, but then again, if poker is what you're here for, there are much better poker games out there. There are two difficulty levels, Normal which is the casual way to play Poker Night, allowing even the players who haven't played poker before to stand a chance by following the tutorial, and Hard which is the way to play if you really want an authentic poker experience, as the AI will become more aggressive, start bluffing and generally play smarter. The lack of additional popular poker modes such as Omaha Hold'em or Pineapple is what makes this game become boring so easily, as even with all the work put into making Texas Hold'em feel authentic, it's still the same game over and over again.Rating: 5GraphicsPoker Night at the Inventory isn't a visual masterpiece, but it holds on among other titles of its generation, and what really matters the most, the characters look amazing and authentic to their universe, while still fitting well in the Inventory's background. The animations are okay, but they do become repetitive as well after a while, and the visual effects, while kept to a moderate volume stand out well in the environment.Rating: 6.5AudioThe dialogue is what matters the most in this game, and the best part about it is that all the original voice actors for those characters are here to voice them in Poker Night, with Gary Schwartz voicing the Heavy, Matt Chapman voicing Strong Bad, William Kasten providing the voice for Max and Andrew Chaikin voicing Tycho Brahe. The soundtrack fits the mood of the Inventory perfectly and the sound effects for card flips and chips movements feel authentic, making your poker experience enjoyable, even when the dialogue starts repeating itself.Rating: 7.5ExtrasIt doesn't take more than a few hours to win all four Team Fortress 2 unlockables, which is probably where most players will end their business in Poker Night at the Inventory, but if you do decide to stay for a little longer, there are a few aesthetic unlockables such as new tables or decks, but apart from that, there is nothing else to see or do.Rating: 6VerdictPoker Night at the Inventory is a fun thing to play for a few hours, which is more than enough considering its price; if you're a fan of one or multiple characters featured in this game, you'll have a great time hearing their dialogue, but if you're here for a lasting poker experience, there are probably better options out there.Rating Overall: 6.3Check out the full review and a lot more about Poker Night at the Inventory at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=359 "

												You bought this game solely for the TF2 unlocks. Don't lie, I did too.However, the gameplay is actually pretty solid, and addicting. The character interactions can be golden, especially if you pick up on the minute references in the dialogue.The graphics do have some issues, with chips, cards and other objects failing to track the players' hands (namely the Heavy). There are also occasional issues when a hand ends and the characters' are in a conversation.However, these really are just nitpicks. The game is fun, and that's what matters really. From this game I learned how to play poker, which, while not the most useful skill, still makes you look clever.Was it worth $5? Absolutely. Would I recommend you buy it for the unlocks alone? Sure. However, if you do, be warned; you will fall in love with this game. Just a general heads-up.			"

												Over time the funny dialogue will start to lose its charm as it repeats, but you can limit it or turn it off completely after you've heard all there is to hear over the course of a few hours. It'd be easy to feel disappointed, or cheated by how short a time it takes to hear all the jokes, but the reality is that this is a small, five dollar download. It comes with all the polish I'd expect from Telltale, and while it only features Texas Hold 'em, is a really entertaining way to kill some time, especially if you want those TF2 unlocks. It may not be the best poker game out there, but it is definitely the funniest. And, as most people will tell you, a little humor goes a long way. "

												This is a nice, cheap game that was probably more fun than a lot of other games I've played lately.  There's just something about playing a game of cards that invigorates your brain (there's actually some studies that have been done that shows that just playing Solitaire alone provides a lot of mental stimulation).  The fact that the game provides a bunch of cool characters to play with, rewards for other games that honestly make you feel accomplished and god-like when you acquire them, as well as various unlocks and random banter between characters makes it even more worthwhile.I've got to say, the company that manages to take a kind of niche concept like this, gives it a bit more gametypes (more than just Texas Hold 'Em but other card games as well), multiple characters, and a multiplayer mode will probably make a ton of money.  I've had more fun just dipping my toes into this game than I have attempting the F2P collectible card games currently available on Steam right now.  I will definitely be playing more of this, even long after I get the weapon skins for Team Fortress 2.			"

												The majority of us got Poker Night for the TF2 items. This was to be expected. But if you step back abit and start playing the game more, you'll notice that Telltale Games has put a lot of work into making the game fun to play (and this comes from someome who doesn't play Poker as much).Now, there is a ton of dialogue in this title. It's nice but it can get pretty annoying (there is a setting for this). You may call this game fanservice. It kinda is. But it doesn't bludgen you over your head too much.Even after getting all the items (which you can do in about an hour), you might find yourself playing the game more. PN@TI actually really well done. And for only $5 dollars, it's not a bad deal but you probably won't be playing it very often.In the end, it's cheap, it's funny and it has TF2 items. If you don't want to spend $5 dollars, you won't be missing much.Result: INDECISIVE			"

												Enjoy a quiet game of Texas Hold 'em with four of the funniest characters in the cult genre, Max, Sam's Best friend and teammate in the Freelance Police, Strong Bad, bully to the Homestar Runner, The Heavy, the most famous class in Team Fortress 2 and Tycho Brahe, one of the two stars of the funny Penny-Arcade web comics.Should any of them are unable to buy into a game with money, they will buy in with  exclusive items you can win to use in Team Fortress 2.  Enjoy their funny conversations as they chat, argue and even threaten each other in this interactive comedy!			"

												A few months ago I was introduced to the basics of Poker by a friend in the ""real world"". While I grapsed the basic concepts and hands, there's an awful lot to remember for a first timer. This game proved a humorous and enjoyable way to get to grips with how to play and learn over time the sort of starting cards that may enable you to win big.It's not substitute for seeing the behaviour and tells of real players in meatspace, but it's an enjoyable, fiscally safe primer for the world of poker.But man, ♥♥♥♥ Tycho.

If you enable the swearing filter the comebacks and table chat is quality. You can also practice your poker skills on this game if your wanting to become a better player. If you play tf2 aswell you can get some exclusive items like lugermorph and lisence to maim.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is, of course, a poker game. You play poker with some famous characters, two of which are from other Telltale games. I originally played this just to get the Team Fortress 2 items you can get from unlocking achievements in this game, but I enjoyed the dialogue between the characters so much that I continued to play even after I got them all. The dialogue will eventually repeat itself, but luckily if you get sick of it you can control how much the characters talk. If you like poker and enjoy the characters featured in this game, then give a shot.			"

												Over time the funny dialogue will start to lose its charm as it repeats, but you can limit it or turn it off completely after you've heard all there is to hear over the course of a few hours. It'd be easy to feel disappointed, or cheated by how short a time it takes to hear all the jokes, but the reality is that this is a small, five dollar download. It comes with all the polish I'd expect from Telltale, and while it only features Texas Hold 'em, is a really entertaining way to kill some time, especially if you want those TF2 unlocks. It may not be the best poker game out there, but it is definitely the funniest. And, as most people will tell you, a little humor goes a long way. "

												This series of Poker games,  are truly excellent little poker training gems. Regardless if you buy this one or the sequel, Poker Night 2, they are totally worth it. Often they are on special, so wait for those, but when they are grab them.They serve the purpose of brushing you up on your poker game. No stress, and teaches you a lot if you can control your desire to ""all-in"" all the time :) The added fun is that you play against popular culture icons, who chat away with each other with funny anecdotes, but also have their own personal way of playing poker and poker talk.The only downside is the reptitive looping of the anecdotal conversations. While there is a option to turn down the frequency of the anecdotes or even turn them off, there should rather be a option to turn off ""repetition"", such that once the library of anecdotes have been exhausted they stop telling stories...infact i'd buy DLC packs for more conversational anecdotes if they'd ever think of that.still, a very enyable way to learn poker or simply brush up.

												It's okay.  It doesn't take long for the dialog to get repetitive (though there is quite a lot of it, it doesn't take long to play a lot of hands).  As other reviews have noted, the players have patterns that come clear quickly, and their betting habits are unreasonable... raising triple the minimum bet with very little chance of getting better than a Queen high.  It kind of becomes unfun because some of the patterns seem to be trying to give you wins.As a TF2 player, but not a fan of the other franchises, I would have liked this more if it had been all TF2 characters.  It's interesting to see the Heavy while playing a card game.Honestly, I got it for the TF2 unlocks.  It's a fun game, but none of the AI seems very competitive, and the play becomes a bit dully repetitive about the time the dialog becomes repetitive.It's fun to play for awhile and worth it if you catch it on sale for less than $5.

												The majority of us got Poker Night for the TF2 items. This was to be expected. But if you step back abit and start playing the game more, you'll notice that Telltale Games has put a lot of work into making the game fun to play (and this comes from someome who doesn't play Poker as much).Now, there is a ton of dialogue in this title. It's nice but it can get pretty annoying (there is a setting for this). You may call this game fanservice. It kinda is. But it doesn't bludgen you over your head too much.Even after getting all the items (which you can do in about an hour), you might find yourself playing the game more. PN@TI actually really well done. And for only $5 dollars, it's not a bad deal but you probably won't be playing it very often.In the end, it's cheap, it's funny and it has TF2 items. If you don't want to spend $5 dollars, you won't be missing much.Result: INDECISIVE			"

												Includes 4 familiar characters + 4 unlockable items for TF2. The game is Texas Holdem, there are in-game instructions on how to play it. The lines are pretty funny for the first 2 hours and then the lines eventually repeats - which means the game could of used more lines. Everytime you win in a poker match, you can unlock ingame skins for the poker table and the deck of cards. I would of also liked it if there were more card games to play.Cons: buggy engine, laggy transitions, short on lines, lack of multiplayerFor a game with a very cheap price tag, it's worth getting.

												Its poker, what not to love about ye olden texas hold'em, no hold's bar poker. Seriously, lot a fun, cool charecters with unique personalities, and playstyles, plus stuff for your TF2 charecters. Yes, heavy weapons guy and Riko-Nee approve of this. I highly recommend it to the poker fan.			"

												Warning: if you're here to buy the game just for the TF2 items but you have no idea how to play Texas-Hold-Em, you're not going to have any fun with this. With that aside, PNATI is relatively a fun, (sometimes unfair) take on Texas Hold Em. You play cards against the Heavy from TF2, Tycho from Penny Arcade, Max from the Sam & Max series and Strong Bad from the online series Homestar Runner. The dialogue and conversations that the characters have is quite interesting and funny, and the actual gameplay itself stays true to the original rules of Texas-Hold-Em. The only problem I've seen so far is that the A.I. is a crapshoot and will sometimes unfairly beat you even when you think you have the best hand possible. With that said, with a basic understanding of how the A.I. works and of course, the rules of Texas Hold Em, the game becomes easy, perhaps a little TOO easy. The weapons and items themselves are quite unique-looking, despite only being reskins of the stock items. Overall, I'd say it's alright at the most, but there's not a lot of replay value to be had, and if you're just getting into it, I reccommend you do your research beforehand to see how to play it.

												Like everybody else, I got this game for TF2-related reasons.  Also, I know pretty much nothing about poker.  In fact, I jumped into this game without knowing how to play poker at all.  So yeah, I can't tell you whether or not it's a good poker simulator.  Though I have the feeling that it's not, because I was actually able to win quite a few hands using a really stupid strategy where I just kept going all-in over and over, which scared the AI players and caused them to fold.  You'd think they would catch on that I was bluffing after a few turns, but they don't.I really like the dialogue in this game, they chose good characters to include and it's great to hear them interact.  I only wish there was more dialogue when it's down to two players, because the last remaining AI doesn't really chat with you at all.			"

												*DISCLAMER!*DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO PLAY ON A MAC! It has this bug, where the game crashes whenever you start the game. It sadly just does not work for Mac computers! I repeat DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO PLAY ON A MAC! Anyway, on to the review.As all people, I got pulled into the game because of the items and I'm honestly glad I did because I would of never invested this money into the game. This game is so much fun, and you could literally spend hours just listening to the hilarious dialog between the characters, and is a decent poker simulator. However I am still VERY salty about no mac support for this game, but it really doesn't matter too much unless you have just a mac. If you're on the verge of buying this game my one word of advice is DO IT. I'm no Shia LaBeouf but I'm telling you get this game, trust me it's not going to sit in your library collecting dust(or maybe it is but you get my point), so just get it already. I love this game and I hope this review helped. Also the straight flush achievement is impossible so don't bother.			"

UpsideDownHamburgerHey's PNATI ReviewReasons to buy Poker Night at the Inventory:[u/]It has 5 unlockable TF2 items (which is the main reason that I bought it).Strong Bad is as HILARIOUS as ever, and Tycho is the human embodiment of modern geek culture.Sascha is Heavy's only love!You will learn to play Texas Hold'Em!Max's cards smell like detritus.Things that could be improved in Poker Night at the InventoryMore lines of dialogue!Sam should come in to help Max, as you can see him in the intro smoking his usual cigar.You should be able to win Strong Bad's Nunchuck Gun, and also have Homestar Runner help him.More Unlockables, I.E a card badge, Tycho's Hair (I would love to see how that buy in would end) or even a key for TF2!'All in' all I would give this Compe game a 18 sided dice out of 20 sided dice, as i have encountered a useful cheat and 2 glitches, but would, without a doubt recommend it, as it is full of charm and charmisma.BTW I am getting the sequel so expect a review for that very soon!

The dialogue between the cast is usually at least chuckle worthy, if somewhat repetitive, and as far as playing Texas Hold'em goes, you could certainly do worse. The Team Fortress items aren't bad, either, although most of them are nothing special. Overall, not bad for a fiver, but not exactly a must-buy.			"

												Friend Simulator, err I mean Poker Night at the inventory is a game which offers the unique experience of sitting around a table and enjoying a game of texas hold em. It is relatively straightforward to play and serves as a decent poker simulator. Albeit it is a single player experience you will feel like you have friends in the cast of characters, as they bring their unique personalities to the table through playful dialogue. The dialogue is well done and entertaining to listen to although for individuals who intend to play a couple hours at a time, there is some repetition. Additionally this game offers easy to acquire team fortress 2 item unlocks as an added incentive, not that you should require it. This game gets a full recommendation from me, and is defnitely something worth picking up.			"

Product received for free
 Poker Night at the Inventory  review Overview Poker Night at the Inventory  is more than just a poker game. It is a learning tool for Texas Hold 'Em, a good learning tool in this matter. The first  time playing you will be shown a tutorial explaining what Texas Hold 'Em is about and how to get it going. It's not the clearest tutorial, though, such as it doesn't really tell you what an ""Ace High"" is or even what it beats, it just scratches Texas Hold 'Em and how it differs from other Poker games. Moving from the educational side of things, the actual gameplay. The dialogue is hilarious and very well written and doesn't differ from character lore. If anything it gives to lore.  Such as Max talks about his scandals to get money, or the Heavy talks about his past education.  The characters feel alive and full of actual emotion instead of just being the background due to this, I found myself actually not skipping the dialogue because I was genuinely intrigued about what they had to say. Sometimes they will even mock you for, lets say, going All In, or Folding the round in means of persuasion to change your mind on the topic. General Gameplay Very fun, difficult and very strangely, not that repetitive. You would think that playing the same goal over and over again would get very boring very quickly. But no, surprisingly enough it actually just feels like a different game every time. Every game is fully randomized and the outcome can differ based on only a few choices. You will often find a single bot who dominates the match, who then just gets crushed by a single wrong decision. The same will happen to you. Thinking that your current deck of a 9 and an Ace are unbeatable. But then Max pulls out an Ace High during a showdown. Luckily enough you're not betting real money, otherwise that one loss could make you lose a few thousand dollars. Meanwhile other times you will pull out a Three of a Kind on The Heavy, who has a Double. In that case you will see a very sad character, who just lost his earnings. Progression Poker Night is known for having items that you can achieve through achievements, both Poker Night 1 and 2. There's also in-game Poker tables and some others. These are the main source of progression post-match. But during match the progression is who has the most cash on hand. You will see this fluctuate significantly during the match, such as from the Heavy winning and nearly make everyone drop out of the match, to himself being the first to drop out. In other, more quiet matches, these numbers will only change by a few hundred every turn, this is the more common type of match you will experience.  Pros and Cons Pros:TutorialUnlocksAmazing dialogueGives  more lorePretty cheapWill keep you interestedYou could learn PokerCons:Tutorial isn't the best Finale Poker Night at the Inventory is a pretty good representation of a comedic group of friends playing Poker. I'm giving it a solid 8.8 - the only downsides aren't that large, certainly worth a store page visit if you want to play against in-game characters and challenge them to a Poker match.			"

***1/23.5 out of 5Huh, a poker game this looks nice. 30+ hours later...oh holy hell what have I done!!Poker Night at the Inventory is a poker game experiment from one of my favourite developers Telltale Games. The game relies on luck mostly, but also the charms of its AI characters bantering away and striking gibs at each other.And it's addictive. Holy hell it's addictive, but that's good. For a casual game I was actually surprised at the longtivity of this game. Sure I've exhausted almost everything now, but I find 30+ hours a good deal for its price. In short this is a good game, and for those familar with the characters will benefit greatly. Only negative I can say is well it's a casual game and for that reason isn't a very deep experience.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a pretty good play on Poker. You play Texas Hold ‘Em Poker with some of Telltale’s characters, those being Strong Bad (Home Star Runner), The Heavy (Team Fortress) Max (Sam and Max) and lastly, Tycho from Penny Arcade.  It’s fun to play even if you’re not familiar with the characters.

The game gives a lot to the people who buy it and you can also gain TF2 items for busting out one of the 4 characters that play with you if they buy in with the item instead of money. A great game for a good price and an addicting style of fun when playing those Poker hands.			"

												Internet comedian Doug Walker wryly noted that people eat up crossovers like candy. It's true. Some of my favorite movies are the grand world-building events where companies worked out a way to share profits, resulting in the magic of vastly different characters coming together. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is perhaps the best example of this. More recently, there was Wreck-it Ralph, a charming CG film from Disney that showed us the secret lives of video game heroes and villains and what they do when they're off the clock. It's this simple idea that gave us Poker Night At the Inventory, and the results are pretty hysterical.As a poker game, it's fairly straightforward stuff. Make your bet, call their bluff, walk away with the pot, and so on. The real draw of this title is the banter between your opponents. Telltale Games give us Max of Sam and Max, Strong Bad from homestarrunner.com, Heavy Weapons Guy of Team Fortress 2 fame, and Tycho, the cynical webcomic star from Penny Arcade. There's hours of dialogue crammed into the game, all of it cleverly written to develop natural relationships between these unlikely poker buddies. Most of it is truly hilarious, and you get to hear something new almost every game. As a fan of homestarrunner.com, I've always loved Strong Bad and lamented the site's long-defunct status, so merely hearing new material from the be-gloved email maestro was a real treat. There are multiple unlocks available, notably the Team Fortress 2 items that you receive when you successfully knock out one of the other players. In addition, there are several themed decks and tables that can change the look of the game in minor and major ways. All this coupled with the fairly difficult achievement set (some of them relying on pure card-dropping luck) give Poker Night a lot of replay value.There are some cons of course. The most glaring one is the repetition. After a few hours of play, you'll hear the same conversations over more than a couple times. You can right-click to skip previously heard dialogue, or adjust the gameplay settings to make the characters less chatty. Other reviewers have complained that the mechanics are exceptionally poor for a poker game, but I disagree. However, I suck at playing poker, so my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. Still, I think that the players' styles fit their personalities quite well. Max is clueless, but he's dangerous as a wild card. Strong Bad isn't a good player, but he thinks he is, often bluffing his behind off and trash talking the rest of the table. Heavy is a decent cards man, but his pride can put him at a disadvantage, as he can feel that a big bet or raise is challenging his manhood. And Tycho, as a character who actually plays a lot of games himself, is the keenest of the bunch, rarely going in for high-risk pots. Poker Night features lots of fun cameos from other Telltale and Homestar Runner characters, most of them quickly glimpsed in the opening cinematic. The music completes the setting, with a lot of remixed versions of themes from the games represented, including Sam and Max and Team Fortress 2.Bottom line, Poker Night At the Inventory is a game made by geeks for geeks. You may enjoy it just fine as an oddball card game, but if you're familiar with the various franchises involved and get a kick out of the idea of Strong Bad getting upset over being called a tiny Heavy, then this is well worth the $4.99.

***1/23.5 out of 5Huh, a poker game this looks nice. 30+ hours later...oh holy hell what have I done!!Poker Night at the Inventory is a poker game experiment from one of my favourite developers Telltale Games. The game relies on luck mostly, but also the charms of its AI characters bantering away and striking gibs at each other.And it's addictive. Holy hell it's addictive, but that's good. For a casual game I was actually surprised at the longtivity of this game. Sure I've exhausted almost everything now, but I find 30+ hours a good deal for its price. In short this is a good game, and for those familar with the characters will benefit greatly. Only negative I can say is well it's a casual game and for that reason isn't a very deep experience.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a pretty good play on Poker. You play Texas Hold ‘Em Poker with some of Telltale’s characters, those being Strong Bad (Home Star Runner), The Heavy (Team Fortress) Max (Sam and Max) and lastly, Tycho from Penny Arcade.  It’s fun to play even if you’re not familiar with the characters. You can change the amount of “gabbing” they do and the amount of  swearing as well, which helps if you’re there just to play poker and grab some ‘chievements. The UI is pretty nice, and it’s very clean and easy to adjust to. It’s easy to get into it, and if you spam that right click enough you’ll get the NPCs to shut up. The only downside to this game is that although it is advertised as playable with Mac, it is not. I’ve posted on the forums regarding this issue and no response. It would seem as if the developers have no intention of fixing this bug which is a bummer because this would be fun to play on my Facebook machine as well. There is no multiplayer, so you’ll be playing foreveralone style with some chatty NPCS.

Short version: 81%Poker Night is a decent poker game with mediocre AI and a bunch of memorable characters whose banter will keep you entertained for a few hours. Still, if you can, skip it and play the even better sequel.Long version:What can one say about a poker game? The computer deals you cards, and you try to win against a set of pre-determined AI players, that’s it.As for the skill of the opponents, it’s standard. They don’t cheat, but usually play the check/fold/all in game, making it a bit hard to play against them intelligently; bullying is almost always the best tactic. They aren’t terrible, but you can always tell you are playing against bots.So, why is this game better than any other poker game? Because of the writing: your opponents are characters from video games (and a comic strip that deals with video games), and they constantly interact with each other in well-written, humorous banter. There are hundreds, if not thousands of lines of dialogue, so it’s hard to get bored.Still, there is one reason I wouldn’t wholeheartedly recommend this game, one large disadvantage it cannot overcome: a sequel that is superior in every aspect.

												Pretty fun for a poker game. The strengths are the characters you play against and their dialog, it's funny... until you get tired of the repeating voiceovers... then the strengths of the game become the weakness of the game (mute helps after awhile).			"

												I'm not too big on Poker games (I can play the game they just aren't worth the money) but PNATI is one hell of an interesting card game.Max, Strong Bad, Heavy Weapons Guy, and Tycho from Sam and Max, Homestar Runner, Team Fortress 2, and Penny Arcade are your opponents and the banter they wave is pretty much worth the money itself, but the game is also pretty good. You can get TF2 items from the game, but I actually enjoy the game itself much more than for just the items. You can unlock various card skins, table skins, and the like as well so it's not light on content either.			"

												You play poker in this game with some strange characters from games, webcomics, and other places that I forgot.That's it.Oh, and you get some TF2 items from it. So if you play TF2 and want the items found in this game, then I guess go ahead and pick this up. Otherwise... no, not worth it.

(Don't get me started on Heavy...)No? Well get it anyway cause it's cheap and you get cool TF2 items.#WorthIt...sorta...for the first couple of hours.			"

												To be honest,I've never liked poker and such,but this game really made me to look the other way and enjoy it.Just by the fact that it had TF2/Borderlands item and such.After I've got the items i tought there was nothing else to do so I unistlled the game.Until i foundt myself keen,and after like twenty-eight days later(sorry) i felt bored  and i reinstalled the game.Damn,it might be not much,but two afternoons of fun are pretty ok if you tell me.I mean,i tought this game was only to have the items,but no,it is a fun bag.Pros:*Items: Yeah,i bet most of us bought the game for the items.*The sairical dialogue and such : Actually made me chuckle time to time.*The caracters: I really got attached to Max the cop.Yeah.Fluffy like my dog.Cons:*Not much to do with it if you got bored with it/got all achivements(with it,it comes all the items)I would rate this game a stunning 7/10 "

												I really disliked this game. Being a (former) avid poker fan in real life, I found terrible AI in this game to actually be offensive. It was like playing against a bunch of people who just randomly slap their money into the pot. AI has a 3 and a 10 offsuit? Great, let's throw 3000 into that 200 pot! Even if bluffing, that's ridiculous play. You're not playing poker here... you're rolling the dice to see who wins. There's really no reason to not just sit back, wait for a great hand, and then hope your AI opponents decide to throw all their money at your down aces with their 2-7 offsuit. The game also doesn't seem to fully understand the rules of hold'em and has some incorrect rules when it comes to things like bet size. A very frustrating game if you're playing for the actual poker.But, that's only half the game. The other half is listening to your favorite characters sit around a poker table and chat with each other. It can be mildly amusing at times, but quickly becomes repetitive, and the poor, slow-paced poker gameplay makes getting through those conversations a slog.			"

Half the fun of this game is the idle chit-chat, Like Tycho and the Heavy having a menacing suspision of each other and the Heavy claiming he's an enemy because of his blue sweater. The items you unlock are great too, for example you get one of the only reskins for the invisi-watch, which I might add, looks awesome, and the only reskin for the Heavies minigun. I especially like how you actually have to earn the items to unlock them instead of receiving them on buying the game. All together a fun game that I find myself going back to all the time. 395 bananas out of 420 bottles of freeway cola.			"

You'll have conversation with him till you get to the table to play with 5 characters from each games or comics/cartoons. Max from Sam&Max series, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Tycho Brahe from Penny Arcade. You'll gonna play with them Texas Hold'em and have nice conversation with them while playing and sometimes bad conversations (ex: insults). It feels like you're there with them playing poker, in another words realistic poker, that is. I highly recommend this game, if you wanna have some company playing with you and talk.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is exactly what it says it is in the title.  Poker.  Texas Hold-em Poker specifically and that's the only style.  I'm recommending this game for the fact it's rather cheap when on sale and you get some neat TF2 items for beating certain people.  If you are an achievement completionist, you are going to have some trouble getting a Straight Flush.  The odds of that are 1:64,974.  Also, there's no online mode so you're stuck playing against the characters.  They're fun for a few hours, but after awhile you'll find yourself skipping their dialogue when it becomes repetitive.  If you like poker, check it out.			"

Well, in both cases, this game should be interesting for you. Play or learn poker in a nice place called ""The Inventory"" against Max (from Sam & Max), Strong Bad (from Homestar Runner), Tycho Brahe (from Penny Arcade) and The Heavy (from Team Fortress 2, of course), with in background such nice ole' jazz music. Not interested ? Well, what about special Team Fortress 2 unlocks ? Oh ! And yeah, also ! All of this, for only five bucks.Hours (ohwell minutes) of fun. Deal with it, this game, is a MUST BUY.

Max from Sam&Max series, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Tycho Brahe from Penny Arcade. You'll gonna play with them Texas Hold'em and have nice conversation with them while playing and sometimes bad conversations (ex: insults).

												A fun poker game that's only £5.00. C'mon just buy it. Half the fun of this game is the idle chit-chat, Like Tycho and the Heavy having a menacing suspision of each other and the Heavy claiming he's an enemy because of his blue sweater. The items you unlock are great too, for example you get one of the only reskins for the invisi-watch, which I might add, looks awesome, and the only reskin for the Heavies minigun. I especially like how you actually have to earn the items to unlock them instead of receiving them on buying the game. All together a fun game that I find myself going back to all the time. 395 bananas out of 420 bottles of freeway cola.			"

This Texas Hold 'em single-player game has loveable lines that make you want to stay into the game with amazing AI. You can intimidate the others into folding by bettinga large all-in! (Unless one of them assumes to have better cards.) A small price for much fun! Although, it can get a little repetetive how the AI use already-used chat dialogue.			"

												This game, is an amazing game of Poker (Texas Hold Em' to be exact) and you get to play against Max from Sam and Max, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Heavy from Team Fortress 2, and Tycho from Penny Arcade. This game has you betting and checking 'till you're the last one standing. Also, at random times, one of the characters might not have the money to join the game, so they put items up for grabs, and if you win them, you get them in Team Fortress 2. To win the items, you just have to knock them out. Max is the only one in the game that puts up two items, that are his Lugermorph and his badge (A Licence to Maim in TF2), Strong Bad puts up he pair of shades ('Dangeresque, Too?' in TF2). They Heavy puts up Sasha (Iron Curtain in TF2), and Tycho bets in his watch (Enthusiast's Timepiece in TF2).Once you've got these items, the only other real objective is to get all the achievements, which is easy considering there is only 20 (15 without the item grabs).Overall, this game can be fun when on a plane trip, since it has character personallities, and doesn't have Multiplayer.9/10, amazing game!

												If you are looking at this game, odds are you are looking at the Team Fortress 2 items it unlocks as you progress through the game. And really, that's the main concept behind the game. That doesn't necessarily mean the game is ""bad"", just not worth replaying. Telltale does provide us with some humorous commentary from the franchises involved such as Sam & Max and Team Fortress, this keeps the game from wearing out quicker than it usually does. The poker itself is pretty unremarkable, however, but the dialogue keeps it going. As you beat your opponents and unlock items for TF2, the dialogue does lose its humor and becomes repetitive. And once you do collect the last item, there's really no reason to play again, and it seems that was Telltale was going for in this game. Unless you play TF2 (and care about cosmetic items) or are die-hard fans of the franchises, there's no reason to purchase this game. Despite this, the game is worth the price tag of $5 for the funny commentary and items you receive as you play.			"

												If you love Texas Hold 'em and these classic video game icons, you'll love Poker Night at the Inventory! In this game you get to enjoy the many different funny dialogue from the characters Max, Strong Bad, The Heavy, and Tycho. However, if you enjoy Poker as much as I do you'll find the dialogue will become stale after a while if you play for extended periods of time. Though how frequent the characters chat can be changed in the options. If you get Poker Night solely on the purpose of playing Texas Hold 'em I would advise against it as the difficulty is novice at best. Even the harder difficulty you'll find yourself winning quite easily if you're a somewhat seasoned player of Poker. Ultimately, if you enjoy the humor and personalities of these characters and are a novice to Poker than this game is for you. If you're somebody looking for a Poker game, then I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. 78/100			"

												Seems to be a reasonable laid-back poker game that isn't after money farming, which is relatively hard to find these days in regards to the concept of gambling. Poker Night hunts after the fun factor of card games and laces it in supporting 3D aesthetics.Summary:Pros:- Consumes a great deal of time- Non-competitive- Laid back atmosphereCons:- Singleplayer only- Dialogue is repetitive- Raising difficulty by increasing odds for participants to have a good hand on drawThrough the first hours the comments of the participants are fairly hilarious but soon they get repetitive. The game's basically good to consume time for maybe an hour of play a day but that's all. It isn't really competitive on a multiplayer perspective, because it's purely singleplayer, which yet again backs up the vision that inspired the game.The gameplay is very atmospheric and sets up the sphere of a cynically comical mob saloon as a setting. If you're looking for something non-competitive outside of playing MMOs and the likes and love card games, texas hold 'em to be precise, then this is for you.I don't like how they try to make the game harder when you get further into the game by increasing the odds of your participants having a good hand. At least, that's how it feels. Gambling really isn't a level-based thing and should never be, so it's just stupid. All participants should have equal odds.			"

												Highly recommended as a cheap thrill if you can pick this up during a sale. The characters are a little zany and are enjoyable to listen to if you're familiar with their backgrounds. However, I've also noticed that dialogue does get repetitive, especially in situations where most of the CPU players are busted leaving you alone with one CPU player.The actual poker game itself is mediocre at best; the cards drawn do not seem mathematically random and AI is questionable. On the standard difficulty setting, if all CPU players except for one have busted, I've noticed that the you'll get dealt with pairs, Ace-high, or other favorable cards. Similarly, the last CPU player standing will often make stupid decisions (i.e. they'll go ""All In"" with a crappy hand while also having a lot of money left).To further prove my point, I came all the back from only having $5k to beating Strong Bad when he had $35k. I've also won 3 tournaments in a row and have racked over $100,000 in this game's currency. In real life, I am terrible at Poker and can't win if my life depended on it.			"

												I've never been so concentrated in my life, playing poker with some of the best game characters including Max from Sam&Max and the The Heavy from Team Fortress 2. Along with the characters amazing speech lines and TF2 Achievement Unlockables, this is by far one of my personal favorites.I would just like to add, i feel so sorry for the heavy, having to take his sasha away from him makes me feel guilty ;_;.

												I never played card games before I played this game. Now, I love it. Not only does it teach you how to play Poker in the crash-course-iest way possible, but you can have the wonderful experience of being clueless at the poker table for the first 15 games and nobody will judge you. Of course, you'll still have a negative total earnings amount to make up for if you want that achievement, but most people only get this game for the TF2 items anyways.The characters are really unique and a great selection from both pop culture, and what people loved about Telltale back then. Thank you Telltale for putting an item from my favourite flash cartoon into TF2. The best thing about them is that you can make them never talk again if you just want to play the game normally, without the occasionally repeating lines that the characters say. The atmosphere and sound effects compliment the game nicely, and there's plenty of unlockable decks and tables to encourage you to keep the game installed. It's really not a bad experience besides the TF2 items. Far better than Telltale's earlier attempt at making a poker game.			"

												If there was an ""unsure/maybe"" option for a rating, I would give this game that.Poker Night at the Inventory is unforgiving if you're new to Texas Hold 'Em poker, but can be manipulated if you're patient and lucky enough. A tutorial or guide of sorts in the game itself would help out tremendously, and having a switchable difficulty from the get-go would really help (There's a difficulty setting in the menu technically, but it's set to Normal by default and can't be changed.) Every character has their own play style, and range from daft to impeccible.-Max is fairly reckless with his bets and doesn't seem t have a grasp on when to fold. He's the easiest to eliminate for this reason,-Strong Bad knows a good hand when he has one but is so absorbed in himself that he doesn't take the others' behavior into account.-The Heavy takes into account every action taken by the other players when making his choices. If he goes all-in, you're up♥♥♥♥♥♥creek without a paddle.-Tycho seems to have 2 modes: Fold at the start, or keep raising the stakes throughout.Like I said, Poker Night is unforgiving if you're new to Poker. You may get some good, lucky hands when you first start playing but within an hour or so that luck will be gone, and you start getting crappier hands (or possibly, the opponents get better ones.)There's an exploit to get around this however; If you go All-in at the very beginning of a hand, 9 times out of 10 everyone else will fold and you'll win the pot atuomatically. Do this enough times and with enough luck and you can eliminate everybody without actually playing.The game also seems to have performance issues, as framerates are relatively unstable (though still within 18FPS at the very least and 30 at most) on a moderately fast system with a 1366x768 screen and the graphics set to preset number 4.Overall, Poker Night is a fine game, but if you're new to Hold 'Em then you're in for a hell of a ride.

After purchasing, I had a very difficult time getting the game to start and when I finally did, it kept crashing after the tutorial. Upon further research, I found out that the game only works on older Mac operating systems and this is a known error. TellTale should make this better known on the page. I am sure it is a fun game, but unfortunately I cannot play it and I have requested a refund.			"

												From this game i've learned how to play poker, and i've learned pretty fast. Play poker with some funny characters from other games. Their dialogue is pretty funny, but after some time they're getting annoying, if you ask me, Tycho was annoying in the first game of poker. Also, if you win against those characters, they'll give you some unique items for Team Fortress 2, which i don't think they worth pretty much because that game is kinda dead. But anyway, this game is a good card-game, but you will get bored pretty fast because of those characters.			"

												Really enjoyable light-hearted poker game. You unlock stuff, you laugh at the gags and facepalm at the failed jokes with a smile on your face, you get the achievements, eventually you will get bored and move on. But it is totally worth the time and money spent :DAnd the sequel is a good continuation if you want more of that.			"

												Okay I'm one of those idiots who didn't buy it for the TF2 stuff. And I suppose having played TF2 or Sam and Max or those other ones from which the characters have taken a break to chill out and gamble their undergarments away would have made me interested in the game. I've seen most reviewers haven't spent more than 10 hours on the game so... that says a lot. Simply put, there's about a million better games out there if you just want to play poker. The dialogue is pretty good. Very distracting for the poker which makes you fun. You get roped in by a story by Max and the next thing you know you've called about 7k with a deuce and a seven.There's something quite fun about amusing, disparately rendered characters sit down next to you at the poker table. Each with their unique mannerisms and taunts. Haven't quite paid enough attention or put in enough hours to figure out if they've got their own style of play as well.The gameplay is excrutiatingly slow. Cutscene/animations and I wish there was an option to increase the play speed or keep the animations to a low like you can select for what level of dialogue you want. Mercifully though you can skip the hand if you fold and even the whole game if you're knocked out. Though the game takes quite a while to comply probably it's already mid sequence in character animations.Aside from that there's not much else. No multiplayer, no playing taking your friends money and assets or any of the good stuff. Perhaps a couple of different styles Omaha high-low or 7 card stud would have been good additions as options, without having to do too much work. The game would be worth a bit more then, but then again I brought it to play cards and already committed a capital mistake. Leading me to brand this game Poker Night at the Purgatory.			"

Otherwise, it is a rather simple poker engine and you have to deal with annoying banter with the other characters.  I'm on the fence on this one, but if you get it in a bundle, less than $1, or the otherwise awesome telltale collection, then you should get enough fun out of it.5.01 / 10			"

												I've heard great things about this game. I'm sure it's a great game.I say ""I'm sure"" because I haven't actually played it. The game crashes on startup on my Mac. A quick look in the forums reveals that this isn't just my issue - for whatever reason, this game won't work on the Mac. That's irritating, but the fact that it's listed as a Mac-compatible game on Steam, even though the developers have said they aren't interested in fixing it, is what really steams my cheese.Bottom line - if you want to play this on a Mac, don't bother. It's a waste of five dollars that could go to starving kids in Africa, or a Subway Five-Dollar Footlong, or frankly anything other than a broken game without any promise of viability in the future.

												It's ok as a game to play to just run in the background while doing other things, but it's extremely flawed. As a former professional online poker player, the game just isn't realistic. All of the computer AI players you face are terrible card players, not one is even close to being a challenge, even on hard. Many times they are just calling stations that play any 2 cards and will constantly call bets to the river with nothing. It's so easy to beat this without even trying, so in my eyes, the game isn't worth buying or playing unless you're looking to get the TF2 unlocked items.			"

												Originally when I wanted this was for the TF2 items, but since I got it and played it I didn't really care that all much for them. (Plus this was gifted.) However it was a heck of a challenge to get them! Especially the mini gun... so many chances with it it wasn't funny anymore.It's a good game to cool off though. Stressful day, heated match, full of energy. Play something that is slower pace to calm yourself before going to bed, a meeting, or a meet up.Whether you want it for the items or not, still a good game and a safe way to learn Texas Hold 'Em poker.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												8/10It's a pretty fun(ny) game if you know all the characters and know how to dominate at poker - I mostly know the former part, but I'm kinda new to poker. Either way, you can still learn poker from the game, like I did, and there are some special TF2 unlocks to be found be taking out your opponents when they buy in using a special item. Also, you can customize ""The inventory"", which is where the game takes place, by winning lots of rounds. Despite all this, it has kind of a low replayability value if you aren't crazy about poker, and it isn't something you'll see yourself play beyond 20 hours or even 15 hours unless you're that crazy about poker.

The oldest Mac I have comes with 10.8, and you can't downgrade, so there's almost no chance that you can run this on a Mac.At least the devs finally put ""not compatible with MacOS 10.8 or later"" on it, but given how many reviews reflect that crash, it really seems like it would be polite for them to, you know, *fix* the bug.So... Not recommended for Mac. Might be fun elsewhere, but until they do something about this, I'm inclined to not-recommend.			"

												The game in a nutshell is texas hold 'em poker played against 4 characters from various video games and comics. The game does have some problems though, of which the most noticeable is the low amount of dialogue the characters have. After having played the game for about 40 minutes the same lines will start repeating, which gets a bit annoying but luckily it can be skipped. The dialogue is pretty funny the first time you hear it but not on the second time and the other times after that.I often felt that the game should have progressed faster since you often have to wait for your turn while hearing the same dialogue over and over again. I might just be a bit impatient, but I would have liked the game more if it had a button to skip the AI's turns.The game is quite fun in short bursts but gets quite boring if played for too long. Unless you like poker a lot.			"

												SHORT SUMMARY: It is fun for several hours. For $5 ($2.49 during the Steam Autumn Sale) it is EASILY worth the money.LONG SUMMARY:I found this game to be easily worth the 5$ I spent. Had I waited for the Steam Autumn Sale, I could have had this game for $2.49. Fans of wanting to play fun casual Poker will probably get the most enjoyment as the characters are fun to play against and listen to their playful banter. The interface is very simple and easy to understand.The main criticism which many have pointed out is that after several hours, the dialogue gets old and repeatable. Although it is a valid criticism, I was still able to overlook this factor as I was so focussed on the game that I was able to tune it out. If players find it too difficult to tune out, there are actual audio controls that let you decide how much dialogue you want or players can flat out turned off the dialogue. Although the game could have used more dialogue, Considering that this was TTG's first attempt at a Poker game like this, I can find this shortcoming forgiveable.This is a game where the unlocks are a fun challenge. The Steam achievements are also equally fun to acquire. These both combined is what made the game really fun for me. They are both hard to acquire, but not in a unrealistic or frustrating way. It makes you want to get them all no matter how many games or hands you have to play.    Depending on how good of a Poker player you are, if this game is played on Normal, it should not take too many hours to unlock all the game features which can cut the lifespan of this game. However, I found that if I play this game on Hard difficulty, it really extended the life of this game. On Hard, I felt like I was playing against smart poker players that were able to mathematically make smart decisions while also making bluffs or even calling your bluffs. The Hard setting is the perfect difficulty fun wise.This game lacks on-line multi-player. However, knowing that I only paid $5 for this game, I definitely was not expecting that feature. To be honest, I was quite fine with this exclusion as I found this game to be more fun that way. Since this game does not use real money, human players can often not take the game serious and make ridiculous decisions.Beyond the unlocks and achievements, this game has a longer life span than people think. No 2 games are ever the same (aside from the dialogue). Overall for 5$, I got more than my money worth from this game and enjoyed playing with characters from various media genres. There is no question Tell Tale will only improve on this fun unique Poker concept.			"

Now, if the devs had been a bit more adventurous they woulda taken the concept a little further.. like maybe to Vegas.I'm talking real grown up casino gamblingI can even picture this old poker face glaring at the video screen, down to my last 5 bucks, but going for it and seeing Strong Bad on his inside straight bluff to take the $5,000 jackpot (and perhaps even the Heavy) home with me.Wow! What a night. But, I guess it's ok this way too... if you get it on sale.			"

												Didn't get Poker before this game, now I do, well one type of poker anyway, but it's a start.I enjoyed the humour in this game, although it can get repetitive, but since this is a Poker game that's secondary and can be toned down or turned off which is an excellent option to have as somtimes it can get distracting, which isn't great when you are trying to learn a game.I found it to be a fun game.

												So, do you want to have some rare things  for you games? Poker night will help you!But the main goal - it's not the achievments, of course. You have a choice to know some game's character better(especially Heavy, if you play TF2), and learn a sarcasm and black humor of Tycho. Another characters don't take so much attention, but fans of StrongHead or Max the Rabbit will aprecciate this.But this poker game is not serious. Smetimes I had feel that it's just like cartoon for adults(not about you thought). For somebody it's a bad side, for some - good, but Ifelt indifferent.So, at least this game is 7/10			"

												 Being the most HILARIOUS and most INTERESTING card game simulator I've ever played in my life, ""Poker Night at the Invetory"" is SO WORTH $4.99, and is definitely a good one, just to learn how to play ""Texas Hold-Em""; a famous, traditional Poker game. It has 4 NPCs; Strong Bad from ""Homestar Runner"", (my favorite character of them, who originally came from a kid's book) Max from ""Sam & Max"", (The insane partner, among two freelance cops, who happens to be an homage to ""The Killer Rabbit"", from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") the Heavy Weapons Guy from ""Team Fortress 2"", (who happens to be a russian commando, who wields a big minigun, who he named ""Sasha"") and Tycho, from ""Penny Arcade. (A geek-based comic, which often has STRONG LANGUAGE involved, but Tycho is the one who pretty much swears in this game, anyway. Though some of the things he says are definitely NOTHING beyond PG-13; as long as you keep the strong language censored!) If you don't like strong language, you have the option to block it out; after all, you'll hear bleeps, and notice that the swear is COMPLETELY CENSORED! And that's why I like this game; it's funny, it has the option of leaving strong language censored, and it's got GREAT graphics! (Any swears said by Strong Bad are strictly be censored, however, because they don't want to make him look offensive.) I give this game 8/10, saying that this is probably one of the BEST and FUNNIEST simulators in history...and the gambling obviously isn't real; it's a poker simulator.			"

												Why you should buy it : 1. You get 3 limited sweet weapons and some swaggy glasses ;2. It's poker , with free money, no more details needed ;3. The dialog is hilarious, really freaking hilarious ;4. It really shows how the real card game is by introduceing swearing (don't worry, can be censured)And at last, it's just a fine game and for how cool it is, pretty cheap.			"

												Prepare for a different kind of poker night in a very different kind of club. In Poker Night at the Inventory, you'll deal with notable characters such as Penny Arcade's clever, cunning Tycho, Team Fortress 2's hulking Heavy, Homestar Runner's self-proclaimed ""awesome icon"" Strong Bad and the hyperkinetic ""rabbity-thing"" from Sam & Max. These characters come together in ways some never thought possible, in a setting few would have predicted. You'll experience a new style of poker, particularly when hands don't go the way of the other fiery competitors at the table ... because these players have left a trail of victims in their wake a mile long -- with heavy weapons, biting sarcasm and irony -- and when they sit down at the table for Poker Night at The Inventory, they're ready to go all in!Poker Night at The Inventory features fully voiced characters utilizing Telltale’s dynamic dialog system. All the characters will talk trash, give unique tells, and react to the game dynamically as it is being played, providing a unique experience with each round played.			"

												Love the game as a poker game, taught me how to play poker.I jumped into this game not knowing how to play a slither of poker, I just sat down, and played and played for a couple hours, got the TF2 items, and had fun. I would play again. The characters are funny, there are unlockable decks, the whole game comes together really well, and for you who buy it for the items, heres a quick step by step wayEasy Way To Get Poker ItemsStep 1: Start Game.Step 2: If there's no special item in the ante, hit ESC then hit the right arrow twice and select a new game.Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until an item is ante'd.Step 4: On the first hand, go all in no matter what hand you have.Step 5: If the person who's item is up for grabs didn't go in with your all in, keep doing all in's until you get him to play your matching hand.Step 6: If you lose at anytime during step 5, repeat up to step 5 again.Step 7: If the person with the ante'd up item plays against your all in bet in the first hand and loses, you automatically get the item without having to go 30 hands into the game only for Strongbad to pull pocket Aces out of nowhere and put on his cool face.This in no way means don't enjoy Poker Night the way you want to, this is just the fastest way to get the unlocks for those who don't want to sit through hours of poker.

												If you are a mac user (like me) it will never load the game. Every time I go in and restart it, it always crashes. I don't understand why it does but the developers a too lazy to fix it. I really don't want to be too mean about this but atleast give me the game when I pay for it. It's like buying a really good game that cost $2.00 (and thats a really good deal if you ask me) but when you play it you are so happy then it crashes, you restart it, nope. You re-download it, Nope. Then you try to get a refund, Nope. But I just really wanted the items for tf2 and I also wanted to play this game. All I'm asking for is an update so it can be for all versions of mac.

												 Being the most HILARIOUS and most INTERESTING card game simulator I've ever played in my life, ""Poker Night at the Invetory"" is SO WORTH $4.99, and is definitely a good one, just to learn how to play ""Texas Hold-Em""; a famous, traditional Poker game. It has 4 NPCs; Strong Bad from ""Homestar Runner"", (my favorite character of them, who originally came from a kid's book) Max from ""Sam & Max"", (The insane partner, among two freelance cops, who happens to be an homage to ""The Killer Rabbit"", from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") the Heavy Weapons Guy from ""Team Fortress 2"", (who happens to be a russian commando, who wields a big minigun, who he named ""Sasha"") and Tycho, from ""Penny Arcade. (A geek-based comic, which often has STRONG LANGUAGE involved, but Tycho is the one who pretty much swears in this game, anyway. Though some of the things he says are definitely NOTHING beyond PG-13; as long as you keep the strong language censored!) If you don't like strong language, you have the option to block it out; after all, you'll hear bleeps, and notice that the swear is COMPLETELY CENSORED! And that's why I like this game; it's funny, it has the option of leaving strong language censored, and it's got GREAT graphics! (Any swears said by Strong Bad are strictly be censored, however, because they don't want to make him look offensive.) I give this game 8/10, saying that this is probably one of the BEST and FUNNIEST simulators in history...and the gambling obviously isn't real; it's a poker simulator.			"

Hilarious Poker SimulatorThis game is, without contest, one of the best poker games out there. I mean, come on, it's got Max! And the Heavy! Those two are bosses! Who wouldn't wanna play poker with a rabbit and a fat man?I bought this game, mainly from a friends influence, but I did like the look of it anyway. When I first played, because I had no poker experience, I was so bad at it and Max or the Heavy would keep knocking me out. I started to go on better, but then I ****ed up a game because Strong Bad knocked out Tycho, Heavy and Max so we were in a duel. I had $7,000 and he had everyone else's money plus his own. Who did you think won? He did. Finally I got good. Tycho is a very tactical player, but he folds too much. Strong Bad wins way too much money. Heavy always bets high and Max, he is my favourite in the game, always goes out really early which disappoints me. There should be more game modes of poker to play because Texas Hold'em is great and all, but people will get bored of it. The only other recommendation is to add a tutorial, because it is confusing for a new player. In case you are worried, this game does not make a real life gambling problem for you like it does to you in this game.8/10 "

												It's...well... it's a poker game. It has plenty of bells and whistles thanks to the idea of featuring popular game and webcomic characters as your opponents to add plenty of flavour and chitchat to the game, but at the heart of it, it's just another poker game.Not even that, it only plays one type of poker (Texas Hold 'em) with next to no variety. The computer players do put up quite a challenge and the game is fun for a while, but in the end it's just another poker game. Which has some stability issues. It doesn't work on modern Macs and it seems to crash a lot on Windows. Plus Strongbad is really, *really* annoying. I wish you could pick and choose how many opponents and who you play against so I didn't have to listen to his voice grate in my ears.HOWEVER, I did stick with it long enough to learn how to play Texas Hold'em Poker so the game can't be that bad. Plus it's cheap. Get it if you like poker games and are intrigued by the novelty of playing against Tycho and Max.			"

												I have to recommend Poker Night. You'll come for poker and TF2 items, but you'll stay for the character interactions and the music. The game has a certain charm to it, and I find myself still booting it up every so often to spend some time playing. Great replay value, great characters, great game. My only hang-up is that it doesn't run well on my ASUS K-72 laptop, but the game looks great on low settings. It's $5.00 USD. If you've got a few spare bucks, there is no reason not to buy this game.			"

There are plenty of other cheap DLC games out there worth the money, though.  tl;dr this♥♥♥♥♥♥sucks don't buy it			"

												Going to be totally honest, I just wanted a poker game to play. And this was a very nice surprise. Its not the deepest poker experience, more like playing a leisurely game with friends, and there's nothing wrong with that, in fact its very nice. This game isn't really about playing poker, its about the characters you play with. Funny, strange, and very entertain, their small talk will have your attention. But of course the table talk can't go on for ever and it eventually does end. For the price I would say you should pick this up, it's a good time.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a well-implemented poker game, where you play no limit Texas Hold 'em.Your opponents are Tycho (Penny Arcade), The Heavy (Team Fortress 2), Strong Bad (Homestar Runner) and Max (Sam and Max).Poker Night's main part are the dialogues between the characters. However, you must be familiar with the characters in order to understand many of the jokes.After a while the funny dialogue will start to lose its charm as it repeats, but you can limit it or turn it off completely after you have heard all there is to hear.You can unlock new tables and poker decks for use and also you can unlock four aesthetic items for various TF2 classes.The biggest issue with the game is that there is no multiplayer option. You always play with the same opponents and everyone always starts out with $10,000.Well it is a simple game with four well known video game superstars and gives you the chance to earn TF2 items while you are playing. For that low price you can not make a mistake with a purchase.Sound 7/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I honestly can't recommend this game.  It's not that it's a bad game, but the poker AI is just atrocious.  Here's a typical scenario:  I have pocket jacks pre-flop and I'm on the button.  First to act raises.  I re-raise.  Small blind goes all in.  Big blind goes all in.  First to raise goes all in.  I fold because in a real poker game, I'm guaranteed to be beat at this point.  They all turn over their cards: 10 4 off suit, 2 3 suited, and 8 5 off suit.  What the hell?!  This is not a realistic poker situation, even for beginners.  You would think playing people who are this reckless would be easy, but oh no!  Pretty much anytime I have a legit hand that I'm confident in, every single player will call my bets/ raises.  Consequently, the power of numbers works against me and the majority of the time the AI sucks out with a terrible hand.  And if you play tight, all that happens is that the other four players play reckless and they end up giving all of their chips to a single player who will now have a 4:1 stack lead over you.  That's pretty hard to overcome.  On the plus side, the animations are great and the conversation by the players is truly entertaining (minus Tycho, who comes across as extremely annoying).  If you're a fan of any of the characters/ franchises included in this game, I would recommend picking this up as that part is rather entertaining.  If you're looking for a good solid poker game however, I would avoid this as the AI is simply terrible and you will spend most of your time frustrated by it.  I would give this a 5.5/10.			"

												If you are buying this game with the intent of playing poker, don't bother. The AI is laughable, and not challenging in the slightest once you've learned how the bots think. The voice acting is decent, although the continuous dialog gets obnoxious quickly. On the bright side, the achievements are all relatively easy to unlock, with the exception of straight flush and four of a kind.. which are just luck based. If you're interested in this game soley for the tf2 items, it may still be worth the purchase. Just view it as paying a dollar an item or so, and if that's still worth it to you, then have at it. I'd say it's best viewed as buying an items dlc for team fotress two, rather than a game purchase - you'll be less likely to end up disappointed in that case.			"

												First I'll ask a question: Who the hell still plays this game?The hype from TF2 unlockable items has ended, and therefore nobody plays Poker Night anymore. Poker Night at the Inventory is a largely failed attempt at having a game surviving soley on writing and humor. Failed because of their choice of crossover NPC's to play against, be it either Strongbad's narcissistic napolean complex or Tycho's sarcastic condescending passive-aggressive attitude. Nothing good can be said about gameplay, because it's nothing but Texas Hold-em, which you can play in real life for free. But if you REALLY want to get TF2 items from cards, then get friends together and play online or real-life poker where each of you wagers one of your hats, that would make for a more enjoyable time than listening to four wise♥♥♥♥♥NPC's talk smack about you.

												I would avoid this game.It's not bad, necessarily, but it's not very good either.  Alright, so it's poker and that's fine.  The enemy AI does not play very well at all  and it's usually very easy to dupe them into losing either by bluffing hard or slowly raising.  It's predictable AI, and as far as I could tell, every character uses the same or similar AI, so don't expect to have a great time if you're a poker fan.The idea is to knock out characters by taking all of their money so that you're the last man standing.  At the time this game was partially about some of the TF2 items you could acquire, but that's not why I picked it up.I picked it up because Penny Arcade's Tycho voice Tycho for it, and he had been saying it was a lot of fun to record.  It also starred Strongbad and Heavy (Tf2) so I figured, what the hell.  Five bucks.  I easily got five dollars of entertainment out of Night at the Inventory, but that's not exactly saying much: maybe 3-5 hours of playing?  The dialogue is humorous once, maybe twice, but there isn't so much of it, so the characters repeat themselves frequently and surprisingly early in the gameplay.  While you can limit how often the characters speak, you can't eliminate it.  By default the game interrupts and slows down gameplay in favor of the dialogue, which sort of makes sense as the characters were such a huge (the only?) selling point.Of special note are the achievements, most of which are luck based (win with a certain type of hand).  For a little while I had been trying to 100% it but I just gave up after getting bored.  Trying to land specific hands in an AI poker game just isn't fun.So, if you're looking for maybe an hour of amusement, yeah, get it.  The dialogue is great once or twice, like I said, and I did very much enjoy the characters.  There just isn't enough dialogue to go much longer than that, and the gameplay just can't hold this one up so everything just falls flat.  Maybe if you're interested in the characters and it's up someday for 99 cents go for it, otherwise give it a pass.			"

												Poker Night is one of the best poker games out there ( as many as there are ). So the basics are youre at the inventory and you have a friendly match of poker with the familiar faces like the Heavy from team fortress 2, Tycho from Penny arcade, Strong bad and Max . There only one mode Texas hold em and its still okay. With the really nice looking style and the awesome poker mechanics and the items for TF2 hounds its a match made in heaven if you have the spare money this is well worth the buy I give it a 7/10			"

Not really a good idea to buy this game if you don't want items in TF2, then it would be boring as hell, I'm serious right now, duh.			"

""Max"" doesn't even know how poker works! They don't even stick around to watch the game after being eliminated, they're such salty sore losers.

												You may be saying to yourself, ""WELL GEE KILLZ OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE RECOMMENDING THIS FOR THE TF2 ITEMS,"" put your rant on hold. Yes the final straw for this game was the TF2 items because I didn't know the rules of poker and how to play. I myself personally love both the Heavy and Max (the bunny from Sam & Max) so I had this game on thought for a while. I honestly can say that even after getting the TF2 unlocks, I can't stop playing this game. The dialogue is not only pure gold, but the music of the Inventory is outstanding and really sets the atmosphere for this game. Telltale didn't just mess around by putting 4 characters together you can play poker with, they actually put strong and believable dialogue that actually makes you feel like you are playing poker with this strange set of people instead of just characters in a video game. It's clever, it's hysterical, and it's $5. Texas Hold 'Em is really easy to learn and you'll have a great time learning the game.			"

												This game? Don't buy it. Telltale Games, the company behind this FYI scammed us. They say this is Mac friendly but not for Mac OS 1.08 and above.This game is probably great, but do not download this if you are a Mac user as I don't want you to see this crash every time you start the game. Good luck.RATING:1/5REASON:I can't tell anyone, anything due to the devs, Telltale Games screwing us Mac users			"

												- 7 / 10 -Nice single player poker game. Witty dialogue with various game related innuendo, chilled-out ambient tunes, good looking graphics that nicely blends together the four different characters original graphic style. AI engine seems incapable of bluffing & can sometimes just be out bet, other times they seem to play with a silly hand - yet still kinda feels like NL Texas hold 'em. Good fun!			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is one of those games you just don't know what to expect. My first time playing this, I had no clue what I was doing, but has I went on, things started to seem more clear, and it being an exciting adventure, where everyone can win or lose, depending on your cards and your skills as a bluffer. The characters are great and bring added flavour to the game's uniqueness. A really good poker experience.7.7/10			"

												If you fall under any of the following conditions:1) You like Texas Hold 'Em2) You know any of the characters3) Like a sort of random, screwball humorGet this game!I've found my next favorite ""mini-game"" with this one. I've had several laughs, actually been absorbed into it, and willing to play more even if I'm the first to lose (the more you win, the more you unlock, such as TF2 items, decks, and the poker table itself). For a little 5 dollar game, it's a great past-time. I recommend this!			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun and simple Texas Hold'em simulator featuring familiar faces from various games offered on Steam.  If you like playing computer opponents in poker, this is fun and humorous.  There is no multiplayer function.  The game loses it's humor fast, and there isn't any DLC, so replay value is pretty low.  Unlike the sequel to this game, there are no DLC to win by playing this game.  Overall, it is just alright, but not spectacular.			"

												Just be honest, you only got this game for the TF2 weapons. A fun game, maybe. You only play it for TF2 weapons, and you leave right after. This game is lacking in variety, but if you play TF2 I recommend it (so you can get the TF2 weapons).			"

You are in for a no hold chips, pun intended, fun. The game can be tough to win all the prizes, but you'll just feel that much more awesome and be able to show your superiority when you walk around the Tf2 world with your swag.			"

												First off: Why are you wanting this game? Either one: You want to play poker with some video game characters (Really?) or two: you want promo items in Team Fortress 2.I got this crap for #2.Cons -The game seems.... VERY unrealistic at times, as in, 6 Aces played in a single game kind of unrealistic (This has happened).Boring. After about 30 minutes, you understand what to do. Either play like these are REAL people and bet like a real person, or you trick the bots into 'thinking' you got good cards (There ARE guides out there to 'farm' the items off the characters: go all in EVERY TIME).Poker Night is painful. The bots know exactly what your cards are, but they just play along. Their cards sometimes (4/5) have most of your cards. $5 - $10 for petty gameplay and items.The some of the items are not very good either, For instance, the Liscence to Maim looks like an upgraded Merc. Badge.Pros +TF2 Items.Fun dialogue. The characters DO have some fun chit-chat with each other. "

												This game has slowly spread throughout my body with it's cancerous nature. With a starting hand of a pair of Aces, Max will somehow come through with a flush. Not only will this happen but when Heavy puts Sasha up and you win the main pot, with Max winning the side pot (which no one knows how he even got that with the worst hand at the table) Max will be given the minigun so you have to wait another 10 games before even being able to have the opportunity to receive such a gift. If you want to get cancer and ultimately end up punching your monitor to bits, this is the game for you. Volvo, please make a better game.			"

												This poker game has no playback value, yet is good for a couple of hours whilst you listen to the character's chat. During this game, the characters may pull out an item which, if you knock them out of the game, can be used in Team Fortress 2. However, the items recieved in Team Fortress 2 are simply skins, and the items do not have any bonus stats.			"

												So this is possibly the most disappointing game I've ever played.  Not the worst game by any means, but very disappointing.The poker itself is slow as molasses.  After you've seen all the animations and dialogue 20 times, you really want to be able to skip through and play poker.  I mean, yanno, it's a poker game - ostensibly.Two hours and the game, which should be infinitely replayable, is boring and stale.  Terrible abuse of the IPs in this game.  Absolutely a shame.  I'm confused how this got a sequel.			"

												Crappy AI.  Poker.  Bad optimization.  Completely impossible to play on Mac.  Did I mention poker?The only way you would ever want this is for the TF2 items.  Do you know how you get them?  You have to actually not only come across the chance of GETTING THEM TO EVEN OFFER IT, then actually BEAT them before someone else does, which is practically impossible.Don't bother.  The Iron Curtain's just a reskin anyway.EDIT: It turns out, most people can't even play this game still, and Telltale has done nothing about it.  It probably won't even work on your PC, thanks to its terrible structure.			"

												This is a great implentation of the popular Texas Hold 'em style of Poker. It's simpler then dealing with a whole hand on your own, and a good introduction to Poker rules and gameplay. That aside, what makes this a fun game is the implementation of several famous and well-known characters, namely Max from the Sam and Max series, The Heavy from Team fortress Two, Tycho from the Penny Arcade Comic (Yes we find out what his voice is like!), and Strongbad from Homestar Runner. What makes this game particularly fun is the banter and conversation that occurs about the poker table during play and while you consider your cards. Each character's personality shines through boldly and mixes with the others in unique, interesting, and unpredictable ways that makes it all the more exciting. Sometimes I forget I'm playing poker as I listen to the banter, comments, and hijinks that go on. If you like any of the characters that will be at the table, or want some cool swag to wear in TF2, buy it!			"

												So, you’re telling me I get to play poker with some of my favorite pop-culture icons? Sure, why not…It’s just standard poker with passable AI. The real draw is the char interactions. The conversations are interesting at least for the first time, but they do repeat during certain sequences. It’s entertaining for a solid couple hours, or when you have a half hour to kill3/5 "

But on the slight off-chance you haven't purchased it, here's the deal. This game is fantastic for those who enjoy Texas Hold 'Em, and want to be entertained while playing. The dialog is obciously what makes the game, but I have to say. the poker AI is not too shabby either.It's the perfect game when you just want to relax and play some cards with some of the best animated characters you'll ever have the pleasure meeting.

Only worth getting for the dialogue, which admittedly gets pretty old pretty quickly.They're all terrible poker players, so once you get the hang of things you'll beat the pants off them pretty quickly and the game stops being a challenge. Having not played poker much at all before this, I found that I burned through the (unfortunately limited) dialogue before I reached that point, so it got to be a bit of a slog.Recommended if you're a Homestar, TF2 or Sam & Max fan.

												The games biggest card is the interaction between characters and you (a little bit).  It's fun watching them talk about random stuff when you play some texas hold'em.You can always just youtube most of the action that goes on but if you know the characters and have a sence of humor, this game is worth $5.  If you interested in unlocks for tf2 then added bonus too.			"

												the game is great, very good concept where you could win items in game and use those items as equipments to TF2,a must have to poker game fanatics and to those whowould like to learn and practice the card game,but what the game lacks is it needs more dialoguesa lot of the conversations in the game gets very repeatative,and maybe a cool feature in the future is a multiplayer optionwhere you could buy in using your inventory in game itemsother than that i would recommend buying this game andits sequel			"

It's a bonus if you, like me, also happen to own Team Fortress 2 on Mac or PC, as some of Poker Night's unlockables are useable in that game. I played for two hours yesterday and already feel like I got my $5 worth of gaming. Compare this to Portal 2 (which I also recommend) at $50 for around 15 hours of gameplay.			"

												It's poker, plain and simple. The trick here is with the characters, an amusing round of funny and not-so-funny lines. The characters themselves are alright, as is the dialogue. Unfortunately just not enough to hold my interest for long, especially with the second game out. There were some great moments, but they were kind of few and far between. Still, a good poker game and decent variety and options. 6/10			"

												An overall decent Texas Hold'em simulator, but the real stars here are your opponents, seeming almost randomly selected based on their backgrounds: Max from the Sam & Max franchise, Strongbad of Homestar Runner, The Heavy from Team Fortress 2, and Tycho of Penny Arcade. Telltale Games has outdone themselves creating an immersive experience with these third party characters, matching their personality to a T when it comes to dialogue and interactions: Max tells stories about fighting crime with Sam, Strongbad rants and raves just like with his email videos, Heavy thinks of the chips as his 'team' and blames the Spy whenever he gets a bad hand, and Tycho makes various different tabletop, card, and video game references. They play the game exactly like you would expect them to, which is a great feat in itself considering the licensing TTG must have had to go through. Even though Poker Night 2 is on the horizon and to be released this month, the original should not be overlooked. There are still special crossover TF2 items to be unlocked, and you won't be seeing any of the original cast (aside from cameos by Max) in the sequel. Definitely worth the buy.			"

												This game is a pleasent little time waster. Something to occupy an uneventful evening where you don't want to play anything strenuous but don't want to feel numb in what you do play. Its relaxing but still can be a mental challenge, with a bit of witty humour thrown in for good measure.Now I only wish this wasn't the last hooraw for Strong Bad and most importantly Homestarrunner.com. With the exception of a Christmas special in '10 this was the last I seen or heard from the Brothers Chaps. Its truely a shame, I thought that if anything their cartoons and humour were getting BETTER!! I felt Homestar was finally starting to crawl out of Strong Bad's shadow and become something more than a dimless retard, but an excitable spaz that isn't entirely aware of where he is or what he says but still a very plucky gogetter......*SIGH*Go play this game			"

The personalities in 2 are a little annoying, and the gameplay isn't balanced among the players (Ash won the first 8 pots I played, usually bluffing, but he had the nuts every time he was called down).  It's a fun game for a pretty cheap price, and all of the characters have their quirks that are a lot of fun.  There is one pretty huge bug: you can't seem to min-raise pre-flop.  If everyone calls a 600 big blind and it comes to you, your min-raise button says ""$1,200 total"", but using it raises $1,200 to $1,800 total.  I'm not sure if this happens 100% of the time or just in certain conditions, but it was certainly repeatable for me.			"

A great place to start, to learn the ropes and most importantly have fun!Only negative is the limit of avaliable items, hoping more will come with time but I guess we'll have to wait and see.5/10			"

												The voice acting is acceptable. The gameplay is obviously repetative as it is with any card game. The interface could use some improvements though, and there's no steam cloud support ; thus you'll lose the items you won if you play on another system. However. Those things aren't important. It's a poker game. Nothing more. And for being that, it's good.			"

												Oh the countless times I've played this, the dialogue is witty the first few times you hear it (Except for Tycho's animal problems) but then it gets old quick. You get to play with a group of 3 online gaming celebrities and 1 gamer that owns a comic with his friend whose original character design you play against in No holds barred Texas Holdem. The only real purposes this game has is to get you exclusive reskins of items for Team Fortress 2 or to hone your poker skills and do whatever the hell you feel like. The story (why does there need to be one) is that you are a back alley poker player who finds a neat little underground hang-out called The Inventory, a man you can recognize as Mr.Winslow from Tales of Monkey Island guides you to your table and referees the game. Along the way in the opening cutscene you may recognize some characters from Strongbad and Max's games. Unfortunately no appearances from the Red Team have been noted (not counting the cards of TF2). 6/10 at best.			"

												Texas Hold 'Em. I don't know how to play it, and I still don't after playing this game. But I had a great time playing it, and I didn't lose any money. Maybe that's one of the greatest advantages to this version of the game- there's no real money involved. In fact, the hilarity of playing poker with the colourful cast is probably the greatest advantage- you just don't get that type of fun from any other version. I highly recommend this game and hope you make it part of your Steam Library soon.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a comedic poker game that you enjoy together with some famous video game and comic book characters. Among them is Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Max from Sam & Max. The game is somewhat what you would expect - A poker game. You compete in tournaments were you get the chance to win Team Fortress 2 unlockables, achievements and more. However, personally I think it lacks some depth. Sure there are funny conversations going on but they soon get repetitive and dull. Also the lack of multiplayer or even global leaderboards kind of depletes the purpose of gambling.I recommend the game because of the low price. Go get it if you enjoy poker!			"
