												So originally I wrote a typical joke review like all the others here but I deleted it.Honestly this game is really bad. If it was a free flash game no one would play it.The police chases last 5 seconds and then they stop chasing you, the physics are terrible, graphics are terrible. The game is basically a cheap joke but still feels like it isn't good enough even for that. I do not recommend at all. How does this get on Steam? Put effort into your games people!! Even if it is a joke game!!			"

												Russian Car Driver is a shovelware game that's not even a GOOD shovelware game. Taking heavily after ""skill-based"" driving games such as Driver and Gran Turismo, the game puts you in control of a boxy Russian sedan I call the Vladmobile.The Vladmobile is not governed by any of the laws of physics or common sense, something you'll figure out in the game's required first mode: Parking. Parking mode consists of navigating the Vladmobile through a path made out of traffic cones and stopping it in a glowing ""park zone"" within a time limit. What you'll soon figure out are two things:First, parking mode is really glitchy and a lot of the time it's easy to slip out of bounds between the cones (touching a cone automatically fails you) and slip back in at the park zone.Second, the Vladmobile does not accelerate or brake in a consistent manner. I spent probably ten minutes of the hour I played this game before refunding it figuring out exactly how the physics work. The answer is that they don't. The Vladmobile will not stop simply because you stopped pressing the accelerator or the reverse - you have to figure out that spacebar is the ""handbrake"" button, which causes the car to come to an absolute dead stop the second you use it. While the handbrake does make parking mode a lot easier, it's not something that comes naturally or is easy to figure out, especially if you're used to driving in games like Grand Theft Auto V that use realistic driving physics.Once you get past parking mode, you get to the game's second unlockable mode: drifting. Drifting mode is actually impossible with the default settings - you can't drift properly with the ""Anti-Lock Brakes"" and ""ESP Brakes"" settings on. With them off, the car goes from controlling like a 18th-century pirate ship to controlling like a stick of butter covered in bacon grease. Drifting mode is extremely easy to clear, since it uses the same course layout for all of the ""trials"" and the only differences are the time limit and the score you're expected to get. With all of the brake settings off, I was able to do this pretty much effortlessly by building up speed and then hitting left and right alternating until the game broke and gave me thousands of points.Oh, one thing I should mention about drifting mode: by default, the Vladmobile will not go over 60 miles per hour. To get it to go faster, you have to change the game to manual transmission - which uses controls not listed anywhere in the game itself (A upshifts gears by default, Z downshifts). However, manual transmission is a nightmare because being in the wrong gear for any period of time will cause your engine to explode, automatically failing whatever challenge you're on. Assuming you figure out parking and drifting mode, you then get to move on to the game's final mode, Drag Racing. Unlike Parking or Drifting, Drag Racing forces you to use manual transmission without any warning whatsoever, so if you have no experience with it you'll be wondering why your engine keeps exploding the second you touch the accelerator. I was completely and utterly unable to finish even the first stage of Drag Racing mode, mostly because of the terrible handling on the Vladmobile and the constant siege of oncoming traffic. The game is not good for speedrunning, it's not good for streaming, and it's certainly not fun. Don't think that because it cost you $0.69 that it's worth it - even paying that little promotes shovelware on Steam.			"

												The idea of this game is not necessarily like the title. Yes, the VAZ 2108 'Vladmobile' is Russian, but that's the only car included. It means what it says ""Russain Car Driver"", that's it - you drive A Russian car. The game howerver, is centered around the 2108. There are little icons placed all around with some short facts or history about it and an accompanying picture. I think the free roam mode was my favorite if I had to have one. The translations could use some work in the story mode, so could the auto transmission in general. For some odd reason, it shifts into neural every time it tries to upshift. It even has this problem in manual mode, which is really weird considering the in-game trans relies on user input. I can only assume that it's because of the clutch. The cars don't deform much graphically, but it is funny to drive around with the front wheels literally in the front. I like that some objects around the world are movable, and there's a way from one map to another. The textures aren't the greatest, but what can you expect from a .99 game? They remind me of gmod in a way, so it doesn't bother me that much. I enjoy the radio, I don't usually listen to Russian rap/hip-hop. It really improves the Russianness of this game. I have yet to unlock the custom paints, but it's nice to be able to change the default collor of the car. As Timrod put it, Originally posted by Timrod: Drifting mode is actually impossible with the default settings - you can't drift properly with the ""Anti-Lock Brakes"" and ""ESP Brakes"" settings on. With them off, the car goes from controlling like a 18th-century pirate ship to controlling like a stick of butter covered in bacon grease.  I recommend you turn all the car's aids off, and use man mode for ultimate usability. Try to shift around 2-3 on the revs, anything over will stop it. As others have noted, the police will not chase you for more than a few seconds. I'm really disappointed by this, another broken mechanic. It might be fixable through the game's files, but I don't care enough to look into it. As far as I'm concerned, I paid for the music I guess, and bits of history I could have found with Google if I was really that adamant to learn about it. This game still needs work, but it could turn into something interesting. Include more VAZ cars, their history, fix the transmission, and police chases. Then this would be acceptable to release.			"

												Why did I even play this game for so long?  I don't know.  Russian Car Driver is... well tries to be a Rally driver racing game.  I say tries to be, In reality it's a steaming pile of..... The grpahics are straight from a 2010 mobile game. And as you can see from the screenshots, this game is a port from a mobile game.  But not just that, That game is even a port from a free to play online browser game (Just google ""Russian car driver HD"").  And it's also available for free on Mobile Android devices.  The gameplay is atrocious. Holding the gas pedan doesn't work half the time. Your car slips all over the place in unrealistic fashion. And the speedometer is clearly broken, saying I'm going 40kmph. While I still need 2 seconds to go past a concrete barrier about as long as my car.  It doesn't even feel like 20 kmph.  But mainly like I said this game is a Scam.  You pay money for something you could play right now for free in your browser, Or on your mobile phones.  Avoid it like the plague.			"

												A review in English, in case you somehow got to this page.Watch the trailer. If the fact that they didn't even record it from the PC version of the game doesn't put you off, read on.It's pretty much a mobile game. There is (some) story, but don't expect much depth. Visually, this looks horrible. Car physics are close to non-existant. The radio is ok, if you are a fan of d'n'b and similar highly-artistic music.Spare change, money from steam cards? Go ahead, buy it, but you'll get a refund anyway (after enjoying some great music, obviously).BPAN			"

												First and foremost - this game can be found for free online and played in your browser.  Russian Car Driver is a very clunky game that's hard to recommend.  If you're looking for something to roam the Russian countryside in and run over bears or deer then it might be up your alley.  But if you're looking for any sort of legitimate, fun racing experience then this isn't the game for you.  Your car controls more akin to a tank than a car.  The graphics are more reminiscent of the early 2000's/late 90's.  If you play in English then expect a lot of broken English that makes some wording a bit weird.  The game does have some okay music, though.  And I guess you learn a fair amount about the history of the Russian automobile industry.  This game could be worse - but it can also be a lot, lot better.  Even with some polishing it could potentially turn out at least okay - there are definitely some features in there that could work.  But right now I can't recommend people dropping their money on it.  If you're interested in seeing how it actually plays (with some horrible commentary):

												Note - Steam needs a ""Meh"" option for reviews. I don't recommend it but I don't despise it either.For some weird reason, I actually kind of like this game. It's dirt cheap and does not belong on steam by any strech of the imagination. However, I find myself drawn to it in a peculiar way.Saying that this game is ""A little wonky"" is an understatement. The handling is a bit crap and the physics would make Newton turn in his grave. When you hit an object you just stop abruptly and the police chases last for about two seconds before the Police give up and go back to watching the same 4 GopnikMobiles and a bus drive round. The game also features the Google Translate Seal of Quality as the english translation is in the same league as Big Rigs. This would normally qualify the game for the thumbs down but it does have some redeeming qualites.The car is reasonably well modeled given the price and there is some basic deformation. Mud and such can get stuck on your car dynamically and the environments do look like Russia. Although, there are some tell tale signs that pre-made assets have been used. Some of the bulidings look like they were ripped straight from ARMA II and the cows are straight-up default Unity3D cows. However, these assets (If the dev is asset flipping) are cohesively used so I don't really have a problem with them.The music is quite clearly some Royalty-Free stuff but it's not (Too) terrible. It does the job it's supposed to do.It's quite clear that Falcoware has put the most effort into this game and for a free android game, it's alright.However, this is steam and by steams standards, this game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Overall verdict - Middle of the road, it's not good and not bad, 7/10			"

												For the price of only 0,99 you get to experience driving the VAZ 2108 in the times of the USSR. Win races or play the story mode, which takes you all over the land to: Pick up your friend's girlfriend or let a man scream while he is bound on the front of your car!While some may say this game is not worth the small amount of money because of low graphics, physics or the short police chases, this game is still really fun to play!I give this VAZ 2108 simulator: 2 bottles of Vodka, 3 Ushankas and the Mannly seal of approval.

												Do you mind bad grammar in dialogs? ..or plain fonts in menus? Maybe you are nostalgic for the graphics of DirectX3 era? ..or funny drunken AI that cheats during acceleration but goes slower on the 4th gear.. uses dirty tricks, but loses the track occasionately? Want a different routes racing on the same old map of village outskirts with the widest roadsides you can cut throgh? Always dreamt of 3 similar car races where the winner is still defined by the timer (finish second, be the winner anyways - came first, it took too long, still loser)? Maybe you are so fond of extremely slow to accelerate 1,4L engines? You sure..?No doubt it's a trash game, pure russian-themed kitsch with over-the-top humour many foreigners just won't fully get, hommage to provincial youngsters lifestyle of the 90s, when those domestic 3-door cars ('zubila' or model 8 of the Togliatti car factory, not produced anymore) were the top of boys' dreams & the rude boys preferred to wear Adidas sportswear as a uniform. Still it's ok, at least it gave me some smiles & laughter, surely could use more work to polish, but I guess it was meant to be like that as a part of junky style.			"

												Just played hours of this game but it felt like minutes, time flies past as the game draws you in so much. The graphics are next generation. Very similar game to Grand Theft Auto 5 but much higher quality and deeper and detailed story mode. Would recommend to experienced gamers as some parts of the game are very challenging.Everything from the graphics to the audio in this has unbelievable realism to it, easily overtakes minecraft as my favourite video game of all time.Only con would be that the graphics are so intense that you may need a powerful PC to run the game on high graphics.11/10			"

												Didn't seem like it when i paid 69 cents for it but it's actually a decently fun game to kill some time. no i'm not being sarcastic. The only downside to this game is there's no horn to honk in your car. if you could honk a horn it would be like 36,529,832,563 (thirtysix billion, five hundred and twentynine million, eighthundred and thirtytwo thousand, and fivehundred and sixtythree) times more amazing. you could honk at cops, other drivers, deer, cows, bears, trees, and jerks who drive around with their brights on.

												You could say Russian Car Driver is a great game because of the amazing sounds and textures that definitely aren't take from Half Life 2, or the riveting story, or maybe even because of the spot on car physics. I'd like to propose that this game is truly great because of the important questions it raises.. it really tests your mind and your capacity to ponder complex concepts: ""How am I still driving if my front wheels are clipping into my car's bonnet?"", ""Why did that fence I just drove into send me 100ft into the air?"", ""I wonder how fast I can go if every time I level up I upgrade max speed and engine power?"".These are just a few examples of some of the ways this game will test you, not your driving skills, but your mind...

												Fun fact: My first car ever was a Lada SamaraThat means I'm an expert on the subject. What amazes me the most with this game is how the developers managed to recreate the realistic handling of Lada Samara - you turn left, and, with a bit of luck, the car turns left. Most of the time. Also, I spent countless hours fixing the darn thing on the roadside. From time to time, this game gives you a feeling that's just about to happen. The car in the game feels like it will die any second.Bad side of the game is that it was (probably) developed for a tablet or some other inferior gaming device.Anyhow - I strongly recomend it. Every man needs a Lada Samara in his life. You're not a good driver until you can handle this Russian tank.			"

												Playing this game was one of the most amazing experiences in my life! Within the first 10 minutes, I ran over a defenseless bear, flew over a hill and landed on my objective, and got more text messages than I normally recieve in two weeks! I was a little disappointed to see there wasn't much squatting, Putin, hardbass, or kvass/vodka power ups, but the game by itself made up for it. Overall, I will probably play this game until I max out the hours played. 10/10!			"

As I arise from my dacha warm bed, i reach over bedside table to grab my glass. having touched glass, I touch glasses to eye. This allow me to see, see the dark inside of room. its very cold outside, snow raging like putin's anger towards west crashes against my cracked window. Peering through my empty glasses previously filled with drink. vodka sting my eyes, I look and carefully step over siberian tiger rug as i make my way toward kitchen. here in homeland, food is scarce but luckily i was able to sell sister for more coin to buy drink and milk. sadly, unlike drink, milk is over. i sigh as i slip into my adidas trackpants (which dont help in cold weather) and i fervantly rub my hand together to get warm. hopefully, fuel line will not be frozen like it was yesterday and i will able to trade for milk at store. in russia is very cold, need alcohol and milk to keep babuschka happy. babuschka love me, she love me very much and make me lot of moosies. with visions of happy food in head i begin my journey to ward store. as i walk out front door, i see neighbor pass out in front of house, bottle of lighter fluid in hand. at first you would think to help but no, tanya requires milk, and milk make igor (that i ) a happy, loving ukrainian man. i stroll through dacha yard, make way over to old Pavlov (that a car, vaz 2108 after many people make!) and i begin. passing neighbour again i see he has bite marks on legs. dog maybe? perhaps scavenger from the zone, it matter not. milk is need.after turn engine many time finally it begin and i begin to drive. the road to dacha is not road, it mud and very sticky. ground layered with snow and mud, rusty building and mechanical sign lay aorund me. it normal sight here in russia, and it make the drive to store pleasant to see. babuschka (tanya) talk to me and she say not allowed to smoke but all russians like me smoke, i smoke lot and when i drink i smoke more so naturally i smoke in car. as i turn right past two bears mauling a homeless man i see flashing light in windscreen mirror. normally i say nothing, dashcam can not lie and i have too to make sure noo fraud commited. polise man overtake me but he slip and fal into stream, narrowly missing runaway cow. relaxing, i return to speed and as old pavlov continue to clunk and chunk as make gear change, i arrive at store. the store is fil with many man like me, out to get milk and babuschka product such as pad and clogger. i grab finest milk of yak, fresh as new fallen snow, and purchase. i do not have coin so i have to use plastic. to this day i still dont know how it works but i am assure that it allow me to not cary money, as the coin is vast back at father home. or, it was. with milk in hand, i also pruchase mroe cigarete because every gopnik require cigarette. i light 2 at once and begin my drive back home. the snow has picked up as the sun has risen and slowyl the dark sky lit up with many sun light shine rays. the snow turn into icickle snow and cold cut my face as pavlov start his old motor once again. i look at fancy tech box as gift from tanya, a nokea, or something. it is finish and it is bad, not russian made. no no. anyway, it say in weird acryllic alphanbet to come over for good time, she has found new game for me to play with her (she play game on computer, make mony on website cal twich, not sure how she make money but money make me hapy and her too)i driv to her place and begin to walk in door, she invite me in and we sit at computer. blothcy monitor make screen look poor but game is simple. the game, she says, is called ""russian car driver"" and is about driving car in russia. she spent many rubles to make me feel happy about this game. she messaged by other friend Vladimir asking her about video game called DOTA but nobody play DOTa, too ocld and notl good. (terible european player). as we wait for game to load she say to me, this game is you, igor. this is always u, every day. u drive u car all the time and enjoy life. i want u to play.and so we play for many hours, cold ruins my day as my babuschka wonder where i ran away to. i call her on nokea, dial number and tel her i be home soon. little did she know gopnik game is gopnik crack for gopnik man like me. game is very good and full of power, like glorious VAZ 210810/10  "

												I like this game so far. I don't usually go for driving games but for .69 cents this is more than a bargain. It has different game modes you can participate in. The story mode is charming in a Russian kind of way. There's incentives, things to find, and farm animals for which you can run over. I suggest that when cars run over animals that there is more blood. ;)I felt like I was really in a car and going up a hill, or in the water, or driving in mud when I was doing it. The drag is just like I feel when I'm trying to do that in real life. Don't know what that says about my driving. lol The starter car drives like a tank and is sluggish at first. But as you progress you can increase your car's skills. I plan to play this more in the coming days. Soon I will upload a video of how bad I am at this game.			"

												To start, the graphics is WONKY - controls are WONKY - everything is just, I'll say it again, WONKY.It looks like something that could be played on a phone and I actually think it was at first, however as a ""gag"" game for 0.69 cents you can't complain. If I paid anything more then I would expect some better gameplay. The game is fun however because of the different options, drifting / racing etc. The main game is boring as heck though because you literally go in circles with nothing to do and no crash features, if I crash into another car I just flip away. Like I said....this is a GAG game if you want to say ""HAHA WTF RUSSIANS ARE CRAZY"" the entire time.RIP.

This is a browser game made with Unity (first results in google gives you it), so selling this on Steam gives mixed feelings. At least they've not put high price on it.But anyways, compared to the quality and content of other recently published games with price tag under dollar, this one has even something fun to play, not just plain dull game consisting only achievements. I don't think I have to name any example titles in here.A game with multiple radio stations, multiple game modes, pretty detailed map with no annoying visible glitches in it and variety of color customizations unlocked while playing those missions off. You may choose driving assists (ABS, TCS & ESP and cpu-assisted steering) or play as it's meant to be. Pretty pleasant game so far for it's price, probably few hours to spend on this one.			"

												Okay, first up the things this game taught me in 45 minutes:- Russians do not english- Every tourist in Russia gets a free car from his friend- Bears and Deers are so stronk they can shove cars around- a VAZ 2108 gets faster and more powerful the longer you drive it- Russian women do not know the difference between a car breaking down and a crash- The police don´t give a damn about what you do, but you shall not break the speed limit.   Seriously, I had a mission where a dude was bound to the front of my car and the police did not care.- Russia has only one road and one city.Okay, now the actual review.I would like to write in broken russian english, but I forgot it already.So, in this game you take the role of a random dude who just came to Russia for whatever reason and got a free car, a VAZ 2108 aka. Lada Samara. From then on you can either continue with the somewhat existent story, go racing, drifting, rallying or just cruise around.How does it drive?Usual Unity handling from any other Unity mobile Racing Game. Still drives better than NFS 2015, if I´m honest.Any other car?Nope. Only your Samara. You can tune it however. Well, ""tune"". You can repaint your car, the cars rims, put advertisement on the back window and a few different liveries you can unlock through races, aaaaand that´s it. You can also improve the cars performance by just driving around. After some time cruising you can choose what to improve: Acceleration, Top Speed, Brakes or Handling.Sounds pretty basic if you ask me.Well, it is, really. But for 69 (hehe) cents, it´s quite a lot of fun. Don´t expect too much though. It´s just a mobile game port ffs. "

In my opinion, there is some Bleifuss/Screamer vibe going on (this unfortunately includes the graphics), there's a story mode ( even with some roleplaying elements) and the rally mode feels like a simplified version of Spintires.

												I bought, like many other people, this game because of Memes.Surprisingly, the Game is much better than i thought it was.I had a lot of fun driving the VAZ 2108, and i most definitly will play this game again.But, is this the finished Product? Not Early access? Because....This Game needs alot to fix before calling it finished, here a little list what needs to be Updated/better:Police Cars/Chases:Even though i am driving 120 KM/H right next to a police car, sometimes it does not pick up the Chase, and if it does the Chase is a bit boring and get's annoying quick.The Police Car Concept is cool and all but the AI isn't good.Random Driving vehicles:Make them a bit more realistic, we are in Russia...Maybe some Random crashes?When you drive into them, they just act like a damn Bulldozer, you will just be completly unable to do anything for a little time (the Vehicles are too Solid/Hard).Animals:Reindeer's are a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, aren't they? I mean they Non-stop Jump everywhere... Make them chill a bit.Bear's also, if you run them Over (pls don't sue me PETA) it's like Air, but they Die. Make them Harder.Cow's are just like a House. Drive into them is like driving into a house.. Less Harder?Graphics:I am a graphic-♥♥♥♥♥, straigt up.The Game has a bit realistic things like Visual Dent's on you'r car, car's get dirty and clean after a while.This Game could be much better With some Updated Graphics, like Update the the Design/visual of the Interior of you'r Car.Translation:I am absoloutly♥♥♥♥♥♥at english and i shouldn't even complain about Russian Car Driver's Translation, still, it needs to get better.I understand this Game may be translated from Russian straight to English with some kind of Website, get a professional Translater..Features That would make the Game cooler for me:1):Phone-while-driving means: Search around the Web or play some little games with your Phone while driving the Car, i know this sounds ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but there are alot of people that do that, so why not?2):DashCam:While driving you can later on look at your Dashcam Footage and maybe even add a editor so you can edit the Footage.The Footage can be found in you'r House, Basement or Phone.3):Basement/House Owning:I didn't play too much on the Story, but i really hope there is a way to Buy a House, build a House, rent a house and Customize it.Maybe you can add a extra Garage on you'r own House, buy some stuff for you'r Rooms and stuff like that.4):Car's:I know this Game is focused on one car: The VAZ 2108.But there should be a way to Change you'r car atleast temporarly.All this can be fixed and added, but till now i really enjoy this Game and i would recommend it.Allround Rating:7/10.Is definitly worth the 1$ (i paid 0.70$).     Just because of Memes,  пи зда бл ядь, Су кин сы н.  ♥♥♥♥♥te censor shet)   "

Russian Car Driver Review Russian Car Driver is one of the best driving games to be released this year. The graphics and mechanics of the game far surpass the new Forza, The Crew, Burnout and Need for Speed. The game has an emphasis on challege and will really test you to ensure you are playing to your full potential. There are several game modes to Russian Car Driver each of which have three difficulty being beginner, middle and professional. There seems to be tweleve levels in each difficulty and each level has a ranking system of either ""1 place, 2 place, or 3 place"" with 1 place being the best. These are awared either on time or points and failing to meet the conditions causes you to fail the mission.Freeride Mode Freeride mode is the where you can follow along with the games story, contacting NPC's with your phone and performing missions for them. The missions you do in Freeride Mode are the same as the missions on the main menu but come about at random times when the NPC's contact you through your phone. There are two story areas for Freeride Mode, Countryside and Offroad and as well as selecting the area, you can select the weather or if you just want to drive without the story.Missions There are various types of missions in Russian Car Driver, these missions being Drag Racing, Drifting, Parking, Rally and Racing. Each mission playing as expected, you drift for points in the drifting mission, you perform a series of parking challenges in Parking, etc. Drifting has a Free Driftmode where you can practive drifting if needed.Car CustomisationWhile the customisation is limited, it is still a lovely feature for the game, allowing the players to choose various colours for their car body and rims to personalise their experience. There are also Exclusive Styles which are acquired by completing the various challenges in the game.OptionsThere is a plethora of graphical options for this game, and it even comes with its own graphical filters to make the game look even better, but at a cost of framerate, meaning if you want to run this game at the highest setting you may need to splash out on a decent graphics card.The audio options are however lacking, as I can only tune the Master, Radio and Engine volume. The game would benefit from adding volumes sliders for other options, such as cows, birdsong and flowing rivers. It would also benefit from adding various sounds such as city chatter and maybe wolves howling.Like the audio options, the controls are lacking seeing as you can not rebind the keys at all. The cameral controls for the game are difficult as there is no way to use the y-axis in the game to look up and down, only left and right. This can cause some confusion as there is no way of knowing what is infront of you. They have added a bonnet and interior camera to help with this, but I would prefer if they had 360 degrees camera control.Pros and ConsHere I will list a few Pros and Cons of Russian Car Driver:ProsNice music I guessThere are animalsConsThe car controls like a hot wheels car three loose wheels and one missing wheelThe car likes to randomly stall for no reasonThe car speeds up and slows down randomlyThe car's 0-60mph takes about an hourThe mud in the rally race (which you have to go through) does not slow down the car, it stalls itThe car likes to stall when changing gearSome of the car skins don't even have texturesDrifting just means driving round in a circle to gain points, the checkpoints are pointlessOverallOverall I would highly recommend Russian Car Driver for its new and inovative gameplay and at the current price it would be stupid not to pick it up.

												I really enjoyed it! This is a pretty nice game for its price! It's VERY cheap and deffinetly worth for that low price! The stroy isn't the best and the graphics are not that good but it's good for it's price, and also it's an indie game so it's good for (almost) any ages!  I recomend it and hope this comment will help you decide to buy this game!			"

												For a random 99-cent low budget game, it's great compared to other games of that nature! You won't be playing it for hours on end but it's still fun. My favorite thing to do in this game is to find animals and try to run them over. I know, I am a horrible person.			"

												Russian Car Driver is a fun car driving game.For what it is, a cheap game being sold for 99 cents on Steam, it's great (although, I must admit, I bought it on sale for 69c).If you want to buy a game as good as Grand Theft Auto, then you've come to the wrong place - this is just a cheap game that provides some light entertainment.Don't take this game too seriously, just have some fun with it.I read a few of the reviews about the game before I bought it; and, although some people hated it, others gave it a thumbs up.So I thought that there must be some good in it - why not give it a go?The graphics are 1990's style, so there is nothing special there.And the car mechanics are just ok.However, nonetheless, I actually really enjoyed playing Russian Car Driver.I had fun driving around the Russian countryside in my indestructible little car.The occasional bear on the road adds to the Russian ambience of the game.I've smashed through piles of logs, gone flying through the air (due to deliberately bad driving), and have done lots of cross-country travelling.Great stuff!Some reviewers mentioned that the steering wasn't too responsive, so the first thing I did before playing was to maximise the steering ability in the options - so that might have helped give me a positive experience with the game.You can bash into anything with your car, and it just keeps on going.After I went through a massive mud puddle, I thought I would try driving into into a river to wash the mud off - but, doh, it turns out that doing so was a bridge too far, and the car had to be rescued (whilst you can't drive for too long in water, I have managed to quickly drive across a river and survive).Naturally, if you bash into solid objects (such as trees or houses) you will come to a complete stop (but your car can just drive off again).If you are going fast enough, you can pretty much smash through anything else (e.g. fences, piles of logs, animals).If you speed past a cop car, they will give chase; but you can pretty much always get away from them really easily (I got caught only once, when I made a mistake and crashed directly into a police vehicle).You can speed across country. I haven't noticed any difference in the speed you can attain on the roads or in the fields - which, obviously, is unrealistic, but it all adds to the fun of the game.I've even driven up to the top of the hills/mountains which are the barriers for the edge of the map, just for a bit of amusement.However, be careful of the big slabs of rock which appear in fields, as I got myself stuck on rock formations twice in the game, so I am assuming it can happen to other players too.There are missions to be done.When you complete a mission, you can upgrade aspects of your car, such as speed and steering.There is also a radio that you can play whilst driving around, although the music is a bit blah - but it does have half a dozen radio stations to choose from.You need to turn down the other in-game sounds to be able to hear the radio better.It would be great if you could import your own music into the radio (although you could just play your own music on another programme whilst the game is running, I suppose).The radio list includes a Russian station, so there's another addition to the Russian ambience.I had a lot of fun with this - loved it!There is definitely more than 99 cents worth of fun in this game.Russian Car Driver is not meant to be on par with the top-grade racing or car driving games on the market, so just enjoy it for what it is - a good bit of fun.

												Beats most of new racing games, You learn how Slavic men drive their VAZ 2108 around eastern europe wildernes, you can play through a interesting questline, do street racing, drifting, my personall favourite Rallye, Parking, and more ! ... unlock new paintjobs for your LADA, escape from police, kill animals, .... but not bears ... dont kill bears. for the amazing price 0,99€ its a number one pick, if youre looking for a racing game. 9/10			"

												OK... kind of hilarious translations and wording... but checked out parking, then rally, then started teh ""story mode"" and drove around a little. I only paid .49 cents and will get 3 cards by playing.  They aren't even selling for enough to cover the purchase, but something to help if you really just can't stand this game.  I""m going to check back with it in teh future but other reviews are accurate with controls and possibly physics issues, yet I really didn't notice any in my short trial. The going into neutral seemingly random, I believe is a speed control function that is enabled when there is a speed limit on a road you are using, but initially I couldn't get the car to go as fast as I'd like... just hit the grass and hills! :)   I found it 80s, track suit, vodak wonderful for some reason.
