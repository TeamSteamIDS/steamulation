												I wish there were a ""depends"" recommendation option for this.For people familiar with the Amiga classic, yes I reccomend this - for nostalgia if little else. It's billed as a HD version of the original. It's not. It's a copy of the original, but not a totally faithful copy. The feel is fairly different, including but not limited to:In the original you were limited to 8 directions for throwing the ball. Speedball 2 HD has some kind of auto-aiming which I think is worse because it is requires less skill.Substitutes never seem to run out (you had 2 in the original and after that you had less players)The AI is worse - it practically ignores the scoring multiplier and the stars (AI is a lost art form in modern gaming)There are other things that can be annoying. Player auto selection can be infuriating and unpredictable. It is also buggy - sometimes the highlighted player isn't the one that moves - and not as responsive as the original. Then there's the bugs with achievements and cups (hint: never exit the game immediately after winning the league or champion's league) and the fact this game feels more like a grind to get the best players than the original where I felt a bit of skill could work against far superior teams.It's OK. It's not a classic like the original. Despite being a very similar game with HD graphics, it seems to be missing the soul of the original game and they've made changes based on making the game easier when easier isn't always better. If there were a bugfix release with a few improvements, I'd change the recommendation to a Yes. It's just too flawed for the moment.			"

												If you love the original Speedball 2 then don't get this. It will ruin your memories.This is a terrible ""HD"" remake of the game. It is actually lacking in some features the original had, like the manager mode. What it also is lacking is any difficulty at all, you will easily steamroll every team in the first two seasons, except when you suddenly play a team that is completely maxed out when you still have very low stats.What this game also lacks is any decent graphics. Sure, they are ""HD"", even though you only get to choose from 4 basic resolutions. Sorry laptop users. But they look terrible. Bitmap Brothers games were known for their slick, stylish graphics and this game almost seems to make a mockery out of that. To add insult to injury the game is locked at 29 FPS, making it difficult for me to play for any length of time due to eye-strain (as if the graphics weren't insulting my eyes enough already).Then finally you would probably expect an HD remake to have online multiplayer. Nope... Sorry guys. All this remake offers over the original is the higher resolution/horrible design graphics. That's it. No Manager mode, no online multiplayer, no challenge, no point in buying this. Oh did I mention the game crashing, save file corruption, playing teams with identical outfits to yours making it impossible to tell them apart (and then crashing after the match), terrible intro ""video"", lack of the awesome original soundtrack...I could go on but this should really be enough for you to make your mind up. Avoid like the plague.			"

This is not forgiveable in 2014.It's too easyThe ball velocity has been slowed downClumsy animationSo why am I still playing it? Because my Amiga is long dead and as bad a version as this is, it's still as close to the original as I'm going to get.Marginal thumbs up 5/10			"

												I must have spent thousands of hours as a kid playing this game. Never getting tired of the bone crunching tackles or the ""Ice cream"" yells. Always coming so close to winning the league and then getting stomped on by that one team. After a few failed comebacks it's nice to see someone sticking to the orginal formula but giving it a bit of polish. The addition of a 10 year career mode is a welcome addition. The new teams are brutal at first but they are beatable. It's also nice to be able to play in new arenas but somehow I can't help but be drawn back to those original steel coloured floors.They left out some stuff from the first one if memory serves, like you could bribe a match offical to give you more time on the pitch. I'm kind of sad they replaced some of the artwork too. Sadly the people who made this game are no longer around. To the Bitmap Brothers. For missing and forgotten homework, not enough sleep and most of all, Brutal Deluxe.			"

												Preamble - I was an avid Amiga owner and at the time a fan of pretty much anything involving Renegade or Bitmap Brothers.This? This is a missed opportunity.It's the laziest port I could possibly imagine. The original parts of the port - the new character models and the stadium graphics are the kind of quality you would expect to see from work experience placements, not a decent studio. There has been no attempt whatsoever to update the game with modern effects, playstyles or really much of anything over the original game save a couple of powerups.So it's not a new or expanded game; it's a faithful conversion of the original, right?Well, no. It's not a very faithful or interesting remake either. The parts retained from the old amiga game appear to be a few faces and still shots (like the winning/losing graphics and the team portraits) which have either been resized and given the blur treatment, or traced very horribly. Worse, these scaled up and blurred originals contrast garishly with the new player graphics and other elements, making the whole thing seem like a poorly stitched-together hack job.The gameplay is at least loosely faithful to the original, meaning that the players are feel hard to control at first (a fair complaint to level at the original and one that sadly hasn't been improved), but they've actually managed to make the original - which gets better with practice - worse, in that it feels very floaty and unpredictable off of the ball, and simple things like catches that would at least act consistently in the 'miggy version are almost impossible to pull off as the timing on performing a catch and/or a slide seems way off.I would've hoped - since they were departing from a flat conversion by so much - they would've taken the extra mile and applied more interesting effects on the player field, and actually made a smoother analog-friendly movement and control scheme (GASP! Seperate out catch, throw and tackle buttons! Put aftertouch on the triggers or bumpers! ZOUNDS!) to actually play to the strengths of this PC platform rather than bringing all the problems of having to cater to a userbase mostly having one button joysticks.Eh, too much work it seems.So... Graphics? Miss. Gameplay? Miss. Sounds? Well, they nicked a bunch of the original ones but chucked some other stock effects in there so I'm going with miss. The gym interface is slightly better I guess. Hard to screw that up with a mouse you would think.Don't bother. Play the original on an emulator instead. You'll get a more consistent and coherent experience, and if you take a moment to scale the emulator surface at least everything will look equally stretched and blurred.			"

												This is an awful remake of a great classic game, I recommend playing the dos verison of Speedball 2 in DOSbox over this.The controls in this game are just awful, press down and your player may go down or just some other random direction. When the computer is control of the ball, press the action key and your player may slide tackle towards the computer player or away from him. I question whether anyone bothered to test this game before releasing it.Save your money and buy something else			"

												Got this as part of a Humble Bundle, and it was the sole reason I bought it.Well, needless to say it's a complete mess. After playing through the tutorial (which is hidden in the options menu, by the way), I got the jist of the scoring system. While constantly trying to put my newfound training to use, I quickly realized that running diagonaly makes the player or AI carrying the ball virtually invincible to most tackles. The AI on the player side seems to know nothing about offense or defense and bumbleclucks its way around the arena while the AI throws the ball at bumpers, stars, and somehow teleports the ball around the arena at unpredictable intervals. (And at one time, right into my goal. Hooray for cheating!)The power-ups system is nice, except for the part where it's practically useless. I can run faster... Until I get sacked 2 seconds later by a tackle spanning about 10 feet. There also seems to be a complete lack explanation as to what in the apple sauce they do. A purple negative sign? Armor on the ground? A can of... Something with an S on it?This game had a lot of promise - and I'm sure 23 or so years ago the original was fantastic - but this one isn't.			"

												I'm not quite sure how it's possible to take a game that's almost 15 years old and make it look worse but Vivid Games do. It's higher resolution, sure, but all nuance of the original is lost, sprites look comical, pitches ugly and it's even hard to tell where the goalmouth starts and ends. Instead of starting with a team that looks like a bunch of nerds your starting team are now randomly cybernetically enhanced. All 'New Art' motivation for purchasing star players is lost. All players are now a mish-mash of badly redrawn features from original characters. If you enjoy looking at clunky photo-fit faces with glued-on moustaches and noses that line up with mouths perhaps one in ten times (once you see this you can't unsee it), you're in for a real treat.Graphics aside, the game is still fairly solid. The on-pitch gameplay is basically just a port of the original with no attempts made to revamp. Game mode differs in a few respects, some good, some bad, but nothing is going to make up for the god awful look of the thing.If there was an option to use original graphics I'd probably be able to recommend this. As-is it's really just a curio for fervent fans of the original. Something to pass the time, to agonise over how what could have been and to highlight just how incredible the original really was.

The matches are pretty quick, so you can fire up the game and play a match if you have 10 mins to kill.EDITSo i just won my first cup and started a new season.

												Speedball 2 HD...Hmm, where to start? Lets go back to yonder days when I was much much younger than I am now, the mid 90s (Speedball came out in 1988 and 1990 (2) but was re-released for 95/98 in a multipack) and I remember spending many an hour running around with my cyberpunk steroidal war bears beating up the enemy for ball possession and winning the majority of my games purely by knocking out enemy team members (which gives you as many points as scoring a goal might I add) and screaming at my goal keeper to stop being a poof. Ahhh, good times.Fast forward to today and Speedball 2 HD is a re-release of the 1988 cult classic set in the future of a bloodbowl sport which is a combination of lacrosse, american football and cage fighting. It's exactly like the original (as far as I can remember) and I have already spent a few hours knocking out the enemy and scoring obscene goals. It's such a good remake it has all of it's warts and boils with the buggy player swapping whenever the ball is perfectly between three of your players causing it to bounce all over the place. But all that is forgotten when you get your players hip dancing and kneesliding from scoring or knocking out the enemy players.Brutality aside, this is classic game that is challenging, requires a little thought on how you move around and a lot of keyboards from smashing the spacebar. The challenging enemy players can range from ""screwdrivers in their heads"" stupid to ""holy hell I haven't even touched the ball and it's already half time"". Great to pick up for a quick laugh then put back down. I can imagine friendships being broken when this game is played on the LAN!			"

												Surprisingly, not bad. Plays smoothly and has all the charm of the original. The additional leagues and seasons add a nice touch and the management aspect of the game is still quite enjoyable without being over complicated.My major complaint would be too much importance placed on the injuring of opposition to score. It always fristrated me when I lost one of my best players in the original and on top of that the opposition gets their goal score from it. Always seemed too major a penalty and this version has taken it up another notch. Disappointing but I'm finding I'm injuring my opposition much more than they're injuring me anyway.The inclusion of online multiplayer would have made me a very happy fan but can't have everything I guess. Bitmap Brothers please take note though, based on the reviews and the feedback people obviously want it. Please deliver!			"

Actually, it's so buggy that during the tournament matches I faced my very own team. How is that even possible? So, I was playing my team against my team played by the CPU. Obvisouly at the end, my team won and at the same time my team lost. And the game crashed because this situation didn't make any sense.I would have prefered the original game rather than this so called broken remake.Don't let the nostalgia trick you to this trap.			"

												I really tried to like this game.  I'll admit it was fun, and even, almost, satisfying at times.  But the poor controls and finicky gameplay mechanics made it really hard to play.  It just felt like bs everytime the ball wasn't thrown in the right direction or even not at all.  If you can get past that, there is some fun to be had as the season structure is addicting to play, albeit short.  But it wasn't enough to keep me from giving up on the game.			"

												When the AI decides that your 2-star team has to face a fully trained 5-star team, you know there is something wrong. The progression is absurd, and the same goes for the gym system. Even if you dump thousands in your players, the overall performance is still pathetic. You're basically facing an arms race, losing dozens of games by a 200-point difference just to get a few dollars and buy players that can actually handle a tackle or two. I have not enjoyed this.

												Some people say that video games cause violent behaviour. Well Speedball 2 did with me as I wanted to punch my monitor right in its flat wide-screen face as it trampled over my memories of a great game.All the fun of the original seems to have been lost and replaced with a ton of frustration. The controls and ball physics are terrible and the one thing they could have updated from the original: online play, they haven't.If you remember the original, avoid it. If you don't, avoid it.			"

Ai is okay, there aren't any issues aside from the randomness of the game, one strategy i use consistently fails and then i try something by accident and i score.  IMO its a fun game but i feel like theres not a lotta skill in it and it seems to be random.  I'll update when i get more hours into it tho			"

												Disappointed,  if you like the original then go play that version.  This version has lots of bugs, controls don't respond until you realise that your controlling a different non-highlighted player.  Throwing the ball is hit or miss (usually miss) and doesn't seem to do what you want.  User interface for player management is 'Fancy' but lacks depth and ease of use of the original.  Overall not worth the £1 I paid for it.  Shame on the Bitmap Brothers for letting this be released.			"

												Ehhh, I just don't know about this game, it's frustrating to play.The tutorial system wasn't as extensive or as explanatory as it should have been, pretty much just hit the basics like movement and passing and such. I jumped into Career mode first and didn't really have any idea what I was doing. The ball and the players were flying all over the place.What really broke this game for me in the first 10 minutes was the way your players were switched. It's disorienting when you have no idea which player you're controlling on the team and where he is when you switch. In theory, the game switches to the player who is closest to the ball when you don't have it. Problem is, it does it so suddenly that it gets confusing. A lot of the times it threw me on the goalie when I thought I was on defense and all of a sudden my goal was unattended. The game can be a real pain in the butt to play when you don't have control over the proper things. I just can't play it.			"

Speedball 2 HD is a sports game with simple controls, and yet enough complexity of gameplay that it could be decent.  Maybe the original actually was a decent game; I wouldn't know since I've never played it.  This one, though, has issues.  For one thing, each Speedball player has several stats that can be raised to improve their performance, but only two of them are actually explained in the tutorial, and the in-game info sheets shed no further light.  Some stats seem self-explanatory, but others are decidedly not, making this an annoying oversight.  More problematic is the fact that you directly control one of the Speedball players on your team, but the game automatically determines which player you control, and switches you around so frequently that it can seem impossible to keep track of what's happening and where you are, and react quickly enough (sometimes control even switches to a player who's off-screen).  That single gameplay flaw is enough to make this game too frustrating to be worth playing.			"

												Hell no!First of all it's a very cheap game (down to -90% on sales). Second of all, it looks very nice and is overall polished, stable and well presented. It's kinda nice and might even hold you for a while with it's action, fast loading times and menus and some wit and humour here and there, but rest assured that whatever this game does halfway well, Mutant League Football did miles better back in the old console days.Why so bad? Because you control your team in a way where you move one player and the AI ""controls"" the others before changing the player under your control and moving the player you used to control somewhere less usefull. The AI for the opponent's team does a decent job, much much better than yours so i really don't understand why my defenders are sulking in the corners, midfielders trying to tell their♥♥♥♥♥from their elbow from lying face down while the attackers are usually urinating in the opposition's corners of the field. Occasionally one of them is thrown under my command but given their position and relative uselessnes in pretty much any situation, i think it would be better if i stopped playing and gave full control to the AI.The three attacking players can sorta tackle/pass the ball while rushing forward after the initial face off, but after a few seconds  good luck telling what's going on. It doesn't even matter if you're winning by a 100 spread or losing, your control over your team is equally puzzleing.AI teams are coompetent enough, they try to tackle, score goals or hit bouncers or whatever else to score points. They look coordinated. You can beat weaker opponents by tackling the crap out of their players and occasionally outsmarting the goalie in the rare cases you go 1-1 on him, but if you ever score off a passing play it will be a fluke. Most matches are a cluster♥♥♥♥ of mashing the single control button (yes, one button passes, shoots, tackles) and having no idea if your attacker will pass or try to strike the ball into the goal.Sometimes the ball teleports randomly to a player on the opposing team if you or the opponent fumble the ball and it rolls to a lonely stop all alone and unloved and unkicked for too long. Your idiots will NEVER be in a position to take advantage while the opponent AI will usually score a goal within seconds.And why the hell do i have to control the goalie?! If i'm trying to chase down a runaway opponent the last thing i want is for the control to be switched to the goalie! Because i'm human and it takes me a moment to realise that control has changed and during that time i'll end up telling the wrong player to move. For example the goalie will dive left and leave the goal unprotected when what i wanted was for a defending player to dive left and tackle!Why are you even reading a review for this game? Why does it even exist?? The 90s ""classic"" was better than this, yes it actually was better despite the bar being much much lower back then and expectations and standards being lower as well. Speedball 2 HD couldn't even beat an average game from the 90s, that's how uninspired, uninteresting and completely♥♥♥♥♥♥it is.Play Mutant League Football, or one of the Sensible Soccer series or Kickoff. All those games only let you control one player on the team with AI controlling the rest and switching occuring at sometimes awkward times. But they were fun and controls worked perfectly (they haven't aged well though). Beat your head into goo with an Atari ST 520 or a frozen cheeze, just don't go near Speedball 2 HD.Developers didn't care enough to keep Manager mode where you at least don't have to play, and they couldn't be bothered to code online multiplayer where two friends could at least laugh and cry together as they fail to control their teams.There is nothing to redeem this game. If you were to throw your own poo at the devs windows, it would be a waste of poo.			"

												I was a huge fan of the classic Amiga original, so when i first heard about this i was immediately enthralled. A couple of days later a friend of mine had bought it and told me that it had some niggles that meant it wasn't as good as the Amiga version, but still a good game. Since it's only £5.50 (i'd payed £25 for the Amiga original in 1991!) i figured what the hell, i'll give it a go.I have to say he was right, it does have some niggles that mean it's not as good as the original Amiga version, but it is still a good game and very enjoyable. Fans of the original will be pleased to hear it plays near identically, with the transfer market, gym and the all important match play itself all faithfully reproduced. Graphically i don't think it compares to the Amiga version though and while many of the sounds have been ported over from the original, some additional sound in the form of in-game music feels out of place. Thankfully said music can be turned off.In the match play, the ball feels rather heavy and slow, so doesn't travel very far when thrown. But where the match play compares particularly unfavourably to the Amiga original is with injuries. In the original these were somewhat rare, as even the weakest players were still somewhat strong, but here you will find injuries to opposing players are rather easy to dish out and you'll average at least 3 per game. If you get more, they can't bring on a substitute and so with one or more players short they become a bit too easy to beat. That's not to say the computer teams are a walkover, they certainly aren't, and once they have a sniff of a goal they've as good as scored. So the computer is at least competative, which is a good thing since multiplayer consists of LAN play only, there is no online multiplayer at all. Hopefully this will be addressed in the future as this game is just crying out for that feature.My final niggle is the resolution, with 1920x1200 being the maximum supported, so if you playing at a resolution higher than that (as i am) you'll have to make do. With 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 now being pretty much mainstream resolutions for gamers, this game really should support at least up to 2560x1600.However, those are the only issues i've encountered with this game. Everything else is very good and make the game extremely enjoyable, particularly for those of us who played and loved the classic Amiga game. Highly recommended.			"

												I recommend this game with mixed feelings. If you have never played the Sega Genesis version, then you will love this game, but for those that loved the genesis version, you will most likely not care for this game.Overall, Speedball 2 HD is fun. It's a mix between rugby and handball, with a science fiction futuristic twist. There are powerups, warp tunnels, and action items, along with hard hitting, good passing, and goal scoring. The objective of this game is to outscore you opponent. You can score by knocking out a player, hitting stars on the sideboard, hitting 1 of 2 circle orbs in the center of the arena, or get it in the opponent's goal. Each scoring method has its own point value, and the strategy is to score points as quickly and often as possible. The game is action packed, and very fun.My main gripe is the differences between the classic Sega version, and this one. While the Steam version has better graphics, more features, better stats, and achievements, the Sega version just dominated it in gameplay. Sega's version was really fast (most likely due to Sega's blast processing ability lol)! The camera view was more zoomed in, so it appeared to move quickly. Throws were longer, there was less hitting and more agility needed, players didn't always fall down in one hit, and there were more stressful and exciting situations that made you grab your controller tightly. Most games were usually close, with scores only 10-20 points different from each other. In the Steam version, I can easily beat the computer by over 100 points in a game. I usually score 40-70 points in 45 seconds, and once that happens, I know they aren't going to come back.Personally, I feel that the original price is much too high for this game, but if you can grab it on sale, it's fun for anyone, Speedball fan or not.

												You see all those negative reviews? Those are from people who grew up with Speedball 2 and hate this HD remake. I never played the original. So you could say I'm not bias and I'm not looking at this HD with rose tinted nostalgia glasses.This game is good. It's fun once you get the hang of it. The sprites look kinda bad but it doesn't take away from the game in any way. If you used to play this game as a kid than maybe it will, but if you haven't than it doesn't change anything. I haven't noticed any frame rate issues or weird resolution issues either. The game runs fine. Again if you've never played the original don't be afraid of this HD remake, it's perfectly fine it's just people complaining due to nostalgia...			"

But, thankfully, it still plays like Speedball 2, and you'll see why this is still such a classic game. I enjoyed the new ability to change up offensive/defensive formations on the fly (but I'm not sure about some of the new power-ups). Ice cream! Ice cream!			"

												never play the original games, so i cant compare them, and i got this game for free tho.first time i open the game, i was surprised there is no turtorial or training section, this is not an ordinary sports like soccer or football that anyone knows the basic.so i select the quick match and decide to see how it plays.the controls are simple, you only need one button and 4 direction button when playing a match.press action button for short pass and hold action button for lob pass, anyway the shoot button and pass button are same, so its pretty hard to score at the first time, but then you will realize that you can kick the goalkeeper♥♥♥♥♥ so you can score easily. and the pass are pretty hard when you first time playing it.the ai are too easy, you can score easily.there are some way to make some score. first, shoot the ball to the goal, just like soccer. second, bounce the ball to the ""pinball like"" thing and stars. the last one, you just need to knockout your enemy, it gives you plenty of score.the graphic are okay, but the animation is funny (in a bad way)the music and sound are good, nothing bad in here. oh and that ""ice cream"" sound is funny (in a good way, of course)the major problem in this game are there is no online multiplayer, i think online multiplayer would be great in this game.afterall, this game is great, its worth to playbut it is worth $9.99? nope, if they add some online multiplayer mode, buy it at a full price, if they dont, just grab some free copy like me or wait for discount(sorry for my bad english)			"

												What the heck is Speedball? No, it’s not a special drug that the kids are doing but it probably has the same effect on your adrenal system. Speedball is a sport designed for cyborgs, played in a not so distant future. Combine football, rugby, and MMA and you have a pretty decent idea of what this brutal sport entails. Matches are quick, taking only a couple minutes, so it isn’t just a clever name. Destroying the other team’s players is just as important as scoring goals and as barbaric as it sounds, Speedball is a surprisingly deep game.I have always been a sucker for ‘alternative’ sports. Give me Mutant League Hockey over NHL,  Frozen Endzone instead of Madden, and Base Wars before MLB. If I’m going to play a vanilla sport I’m going to do it in real life, reserving futuristic robot sports for the video game medium. Speedball 2 HD is a remake of the Bitmap Brothers’ most successful game, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe. It’s been over 20 years since the last decent Speedball game and this is the most accurate representation of the sport/game you are going to find. Vivid Games has done the series justice and thank god Mastertronic had the balls to publish the damn thing.   Speedball is astonishingly simple thanks to a refined control scheme, and two basic rules: The first is to put the biscuit in the basket and the second is to devastate the other team with sick tackles. This is all made very easy by having only one button for all actions, and I highly suggest you have a controller while playing as this will make things much easier. When you have ball possession, pressing the action button will throw the ball in that direction and holding the action button will lob the ball in the air. Pressing the action button without the ball initiates a tackle and your player will slide in the direction he is facing, mauling any opposing player in the way. I’m going to level with you, this ain’t no graceful ballet and Speedball games can quickly devolve into all out brawls since points are rewarded for injuring players on the other team. Once a player is injured by having all their health depleted, they are carted off by medical bots and replaced by a substitute. It’s not my favorite tactic, but beating the other team down so you have a player advantage is acceptable in Speedball, and a great way to win games. Aside from mashing up the other team and scoring goals, there are a number of variables on the field that can change the game. The permanent structures such as bumpers will not only change the course of the ball, but will award bonus points if a team manages to score after the bumper is hit. Bumpers can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes, conjuring up some interesting plays. If you thought it was fun dunking in NBA Street after launching the ball off the backboard...Speedball 2 HD makes that look like child’s play. Ramps on the sides of the field will accelerate the ball and give a 50 percent bonus to points scored on that run, however this is cancelled when the opponent puts it through the ramp. This makes controlling the sidelines paramount to success as it can effectively half the amount of points you need to score during a game. This is especially important when you’re up against a stronger, faster, better team and you don’t have Michael Jordan or Bill Murray on your roster. Other structures on the field include stars on the side that can be used for extra points, as well as portals that will teleport the ball to the other side of the field. Take note playmaking wizards. Finally, random powerups will be littered across the throughout the game that can temporarily boost a player, or harm the opposing team. There are several modes in Speedball 2 HD including quick play, tournament, and a career mode. Career mode puts you in the role of a GM of a team, which you can name and choose a logo, but that is about it when it comes to customization. As you win games, you get cash that can be used to train your players and increase their stats. I found after a couple seasons my winnings had allowed my team to surpass everyone in the galaxy stat-wise so games became terribly easy and I was blowing out teams by 100 points every game. That being said, the AI isn’t great and Speedball 2 HD is best played on a couch with a friend. Multiplayer is unfortunately limited to local only so you are going to have to convince people to come to your house.    Speedball 2 HD is a great remake, and as I mentioned previously the best version of the game you are going to find. It’s not bustling with features but it has some depth to it. The career mode will keep you busy enough to get your money’s worth and a decent sense of progression across multiple seasons. No online multiplayer is a shame, but if you can manage to get a group of friends over for a small tournament it will be a great game to have. It’s fast, and easy to learn and a hard hitting little gem that satiate your need for a Murderball game.			"

												I never even played the original game, yet still get a huge wave of nostalgia when playing this - I think since the sounds and gameplay remind me of Ice Hockey on the NES - but on steroids. So fun and addicting for me...the second I opened it up I couldn't exit until I beat the first cup or whatever its called...heh. However, I got this through Humble Bundle - don't think I would pay 10 bucks for it, but honestly haven't explored the rest of the game options beyond Career mode so far. If 10 bucks isn't much to you, then I recomend picking it up if you're in to these type of games :D  If 10 is pushing it for you, I'd wait for it to go on sale (or grab it from Humble Bundle now!)Enjoy!

												This game has no way to assign specific controllers to players.  No matter how I try to use my Xbox 360 controllers for the game, it stupidly thinks my Logitech G13's tiny little joystick is the controller even if it is unplugged.This game is meant to be played with a gaming controller, not keyboard and mouse.  It gets a NO vote from me until the devs fix this.			"

												An old faithful Amiga player returning to look at Speedball 2. It's the same game, and at the same time it really isn't the same game!For any Amiga purists out there, you'll notice that causing injuries to other players is a lot easier on this ""HD"" version, and the ball isn't quite as quick or fluid in the way that it moves around the screen. To me at least it feels like passing became slow and easy - and the ball certainly doesn't travel as far. Gone are the days where you charged the opposing CF and threw it to your winger with plenty of style and grace.The faces of old memorable characters are still there, but a real shame they haven't kept their old names - greats such as the old Jams, Norman, Montez, Cooper... all present, but with stupid names. I'd love to have seen them keep those, or at least make player names editable.If you can overlook what some would say are trivial aesthetics, the game is enjoyable, with added features such as scouting your opponents stats  before playing them and suchlike.At the Steam sale price of under £2 its an excellent bargain.Now, if only I can find Bloodwych, Supercars 2 and Sensible Soccer on here... ;)			"

												good:no stupid experiments on the simplicity of the game. you feel directly at home. it is fun to playthey even did not do anything to improve the sometimes weird pass/shot systemnot so good:the system of passing is (still) annoying after all these years. players prefer to pass rather than go long or shoot. it is sometimes rather impossible to get this hot potato out of your end zone. sometimes just passing among your players will have the ball end up right in front of your goal. sometimes it is almost like certain regions of the field (multipliers, stars) are ""out of bounds"", players will just not pass or shoot there. annoying!they forgot to port some of the great sounds - like that ""SLAM"" when you hit a goal after knocking down that goalie. Or that bone-break sound right before the KO. and the great music of course.are there ever any COINS popping up? I get the new system of intergalactic cup and so forth, but do you really have to artificially prolong the leveling of players and the evolvement of the team by not giving out any financial funds what so ever? really really annoying.no network (internet) duelling - enough said.Overall: I enjoyed it, could have been a lot worse but for old times sake give us some sounds back and more money			"

												Speedball 2 HD, is a modern retelling of the Amiga classic. All the original Amiga coding has been sliced, gutted, reworked and repackaged with a new graphics system, which does add some shinier visuals while keeping the 2d view element.Unlike some other so-called HD remakes. The gameplay systems and features offered has seen a big improvement.Namely, Strategic play modes, changable on the fly: Attack, Defence, balanced.League/cup mode.  What is essentially a career mode, allowing you to make transfers, upgrade skills and compete for league and cup supremacy.6 brand new speedball arenas. And more.Trophies and Achievements to collect, as well as trading cardsThe game supports the use of joypads and controllers, although there's no real issue with standard keyboard input controls in terms of playing. Some people have said that due to the stoic 8 way control system of the original the updated version can seem like it assists throwing/scoring/passing functions. However i think this is still well balanced and doesn't have a noticable affect on the gameplay as a whole.All the rough, violent, fast paced fun is there with extra features to keep you interested.While the game does feature a multiplayer mode, this is local multiplayer only. Which is the games one major downfall. It'd have been nice to be able to matchmake, take your team online and generally play with the world.Overall, highly recommended game :) Well worth the price.

												I didn't play any of the other version of Speedball 2 since the old Amiga version. I was really disapointed to see that there is no ability to play as the manager and initially gave this a big thumbs down. The manager mode may be missing but there is at least some more content regards leagues/cups for when you play single player mode. I think the difficulty could do with tweaking though as it's insanely easy in the leagues and insanely difficult in the cups until later on (even though I get that this is kind of on purpose, it needs a tweak to keep things interesting). That said, I got this one sale and although there are a tone of things that could be done to this game to improve it, I've had some fun with it. Since I paid I think 1-2 Euro for it, for that money I'll give it a thumbs up. Expect to find things you don't like about this game but it can be a bit of fun if you are ok with playing solo as there is no online multiplayer functionality.  "

												At long, long last..Speedball 2 (Brutal Deluxe) for the PC the way it was meant to be. If you're a fan of this game originally released in 1988! then get Speedball 2 HD. It's a good recreation of the original with a nice updated HD graphics. If you felt somewhat dissapointed by the 2004 remake Speedball 2 Evolution because it was nothing like the original, then fear not this is the real deal, except maybe the omission of the manager screen which is a BIG negative.If you are not familiar with Speedball 2 at all then think Burt Reynolds, Rollerball and it's pretty much the game of the film. What? You're not that old I hear you cry?I'm so glad that this classic old favourite has been reborn, it's simple, addictive and brutal and rght now only £1.74 from Humble Bundle.			"

												Lots of years ago this was one of my favourite Amiga games. The graphical update is ok. I'm also glad that (at least I think it's true) they haven't touched the gameplay. The controls could be better, but they probably weren't all that good in the original either. Anyway, I felt right at home after just a couple of minutes. I really recommended it if you want to feed your nostalgia nerve.			"

												At long, long last..Speedball 2 (Brutal Deluxe) for the PC the way it was meant to be. If you're a fan of this game originally released in 1988! then get Speedball 2 HD. It's a good recreation of the original with a nice updated HD graphics. If you felt somewhat dissapointed by the 2004 remake Speedball 2 Evolution because it was nothing like the original, then fear not this is the real deal, except maybe the omission of the manager screen which is a BIG negative.If you are not familiar with Speedball 2 at all then think Burt Reynolds, Rollerball and it's pretty much the game of the film. What? You're not that old I hear you cry?I'm so glad that this classic old favourite has been reborn, it's simple, addictive and brutal and rght now only £1.74 from Humble Bundle.			"

												do you remember the Amega version of this game, if so and you liked it then you should buy this. the graphics are improved  and the game play is  just as fast paced and frantic as ever as you battle to be Speedball champion. and there is lots more game options is this version too.still love to see the robots carry an apponent of the field after you have knocked him out cold.

												A great game which plays EXACTLY like the original, except in HD. My only criticism is the menu interface. Baffling is the word that springs to mind.

												good:no stupid experiments on the simplicity of the game. you feel directly at home. it is fun to playthey even did not do anything to improve the sometimes weird pass/shot systemnot so good:the system of passing is (still) annoying after all these years. players prefer to pass rather than go long or shoot. it is sometimes rather impossible to get this hot potato out of your end zone. sometimes just passing among your players will have the ball end up right in front of your goal. sometimes it is almost like certain regions of the field (multipliers, stars) are ""out of bounds"", players will just not pass or shoot there. annoying!they forgot to port some of the great sounds - like that ""SLAM"" when you hit a goal after knocking down that goalie. Or that bone-break sound right before the KO. and the great music of course.are there ever any COINS popping up? I get the new system of intergalactic cup and so forth, but do you really have to artificially prolong the leveling of players and the evolvement of the team by not giving out any financial funds what so ever? really really annoying.no network (internet) duelling - enough said.Overall: I enjoyed it, could have been a lot worse but for old times sake give us some sounds back and more money			"

												Astounding, 20 years ago I would have recommended this game on the Mega Drive; I still have my Mega Drive & the game.  There is a manager option on the Mega Drive game, so this manages to have less functionality than it did 20 years ago.  I also don't seem to be able to find the saved game file to do things like  change names of my players; which I'd expect to be able to do with notepad or a hex editor when playing with a game this old. Apparently Steam don't like you editing games or so I've been told. Who the hell are Steam to tell me what I can or can't do with my game?  Disappointed as I increasingly am by games on Steam. It seems you lose something in functionality, lose something from old games, and in return, get nothing from Steam.  When will they realise that mistreating their customers will eventually lead to them losing customers?  Only when we stop buying from them I suppose. I'd rather go Good Old Games.			"

												Not as bad as they say.OK it's certainly not as good as it could have been, but it's not dreadful either. The controls are reasonable. I've been using the Xbox controller and I've been able to string some passes together, go on some dribbling runs, and the after touch is fairly easy to apply. One irritancy is the over dependence on slide tackling when you don't have the ball.The graphics are adequate, sound ok, although it's a shame the original awesome music is missing. A nice touch is the sound effect of the old Amiga disk drive during some of the loading screens.They have overkilled the ""Ice cream!"" as well. I remember hearing it once in a while during replays back in the Amiga Speedball days. You will hear it a few times every match in this remake.""HD"" is stretching it but I picked it up in a sale and have definitely had some fun with it.			"

I personally like top down sports games, but there was no tutorial, I only learnt from seeing what the bots did. There's some weird circle in the middle you can get 2 points from hitting, and you can get a ton of points from scorring a regular goal. There's some sort ofpower up that the bot used, it knocked out all my players.... my players can't seem to pass a certain part of the feild... Anyways the bot got 5 goals and then I raged on out.

												I'll start this off by saying I'm a big fan of the original Speedball 2, I played it across Amiga, Megadrive and the Master System and was glad to hear there was an HD remake coming to PC too. I may be one of the few old fans that are actually happy with this release and am still having a lot of fun with it. This release is not without it's bugs though and there are a few features missing that would have really made this game a big hit with the old fans and the new blood alike. Positives. The old core game is still there, the fast paced violence, the chaos, the crunching of bone and shoulderpad...just wonderful! The graphics, despite what a lot of detractors say, are quite nice (funtional at worst) and I like a lot of the new team skins and different stadiums. Sometimes the original could get a bit confusing and I think this is a far easier entry point for new players. The game also replicates the Amiga 500's floppy disc drive while loading up matches, I almost spat out my beer when I heard it and I am so glad they put it in.  Negatives. There is no Manager Mode and there is no online Multiplayer. Online play i can forgive to an extent, i would prefer to play in the same room as the guy i am absolutely destyroying but that just isn't possible today. None of my friends can be bothered to play it so online play would have been a bloody godsend. I'm not sure if it was too much hassle, if there were time constraints or if it was a dev/publisher decision, but the community has been fairly vocal about it and i don't think anymore needs to be said. Manager Mode on the other hand, sometimes I just wanna chill and manage my players and watch two teams kick the crap out of each other as I roar at them, drinking a beer and shouting obscenities. Sadly it's not here and I don't know why.  Other than the odd glitch here and there, that's really all there is to say. There has been a lot of hate thrown at it,  45% of it is people viewing the game with rose tinted glasses to the point where they think the original was perfect in every way and had absolutely no flaws. The other 45% is people crying like babies about no online play and just throwing hate like children, simple as that. Only a few people have actually given proper criticism and helped report any flaws the game has, so take a lot of the negativity with a pinch of salt!Totally worth the asking price, and if you don't think so then wait for a deal i guess...i know i've had my monies worth, I'd just like to see the title be the brilliant game it could be.

												This is one of the best and most fun sports games in my opinion.  It's fast, it's tough, and it's exciting.  What else could you ask for?  This is certainly an improvement over the last speedball game released (I believe it was called Speedball 2 Tournament or something of that nature).  If you are a fan of the Speedball series, you HAVE to get this.  If you don't know what speedball is, think of football and hockey combined.  That's about the best I can explain it because it's unlike anything else.  And that's a good thing!  If you're unsure on whether to buy it or not, just buy it already!  You won't regret it.			"

Unfortunately this one just misses on the team management content and the money rewards are very pathetic.  Especially when you are entered into the Intergallactic Cup where the teams are maxed out and impossible to beat.  Player trade is there, but again very exepensive.In game controls work ok most of the time, with the occassional WTF!, why did you go that way.Fingers crossed an update comes to fix some of the minor problems.If you liked the original, this game is a good addition.

												edit: Valve has now added an ""Online Multiplayer"" tag to the tag pool, which they should have always had since the beginning. As such, since they likely abandoned this game the moment it was published on Steam, we'll never have to worry about the publisher ever adding the wrong tag again, ad the old ""wrong tag"" is now the right one.Old:Publisher lies about this game having online multiplayer by using the ""Multiplayer"" store tag, when it is Local (Co-Op, the Valve designated tag for this).

Control are half broken, cant navigate the menu, when you type the name of the team, its work half the time, you enter a letter its go back in the menu.The Graphics are cartoon instead of being cool like the classic ones.The gameplay is fine but only if you use the keyboard. In the menu its all broken, cant navigate, completly buggy!			"

												Championships achievements don't works + various minor bugs, yet no support from devs since 4 months.Botched up port of the 1990 classic. The gameplay is exactly the same as 25 year ago, with jerky 30 fps anims. poor active character selection, and abyssimal AI. What was acceptable in 1990 feels below average today.True to the name the game is in HD and you won't see any pixelated gfx, however the original game used a 32 colours palette with subtle shade and nuance to great effects, this release make a very poor use of the extended palette available and the new gfx have lost the famous Bitmap Brothers ""metalic look"".During the match the game works correctly, and you can have some fun for a while, but there are small bugs here or there.  For example you can win all your league matchs by a comfortable margin but from time to time your league ranking is n't properly updated to reflect your performances. This is a serious issue in carrer mode, as there is a good chance that over the 10 seasons career one of your season will be bugged.A few modes have been added but overal there is a lack of attention to details. The gameplay is very unbalanced as most game are either too hard (sometimes) or too easy (often).There is controller support for Player 1 but not for player 2 :((, moreover there is only local multiplayer.There are 20 peoples listed in the credits including 5 programmers and 5 for QA, but the result is very disapointing, and the lack of infos and support is a shame.Certainly not worth the full price, some single player value may make it worth it on sale.

												I never played the original... I've heard it's some kind of classic. Nevertheless, Speedball 2 HD is not. Very simplistic future-sport simulator. Simplistic in manner of controls, game rules can be a little unclear at first. Punch everyone, toss the ball into goal, into holes in the walls, bounce it from obstacles.... it's all worth points! Confusing.The concept is fun. For a 15 minutes.. then it starts to get boring. Gameplay is very fast, most of the time it's hard to see whats happening. Then starts the button mashing. One button mashing. Theres only one button you can press (excluding direction keys). So... you can kick someone in the face (no possesion) or pass/shoot the ball (possesion). No other tactical options. Very quickly you will come to a conclusion that you could be playing something a lot better than Speedball 2 HD. Then, you'll switch it off and never come back. Sorry Speedball, i gave you a chance.			"

												They have taken Speedball 2, butchered it, r*ped the remains, and then butchered it some more.If you don't know the original Speedball 2, do yourself a favour and stay away from this dreck.If you know and love the original Speedball 2, here's an incomprehensive list of what's terrible about this remake:The graphics are in HD, yes, and there is a resemblance to the original. But: The colours are terrible and create a way too fabulous look and feel. At the same time, animations are as bumpy as back in the day, but without any of the original charme.The controls are sucky. Just plain bad.That not only goes for matches, but also for menus. Try doing anything in this game with a gamepad and you'll end up doing a lot of things you didn't mean to do.It seems as though they have changed the gameplay for the worse. It's way too easy to win, which is partly thanks to a horrible AI. Also, I had the feeling that my players who should have been knocked out just kept going regardless.The user interface is a mess. The gym functions are particularly annoying. Selected players' faces will be highlighted, but very subtly so, so you need to be extra careful not to overtrain. I didn't see any skill values in numbers, as well.The music doesn't cut it, neither do the sound effects. But then again it would be hard to live up to the original.All in all, a waste of time for anyone involved. Speedball 2 is definitely a game that would deserve a proper remake, and probably without ""HD"". But this one is not it.			"

												I remember this game so fondly back in the early 1990's on my Amiga 500. It is a true cult classic!I must have racked up 1000 hours playing this when i younger was so much fun. sure its dated by todays standards.This re-release still has the same gameplay, with more expanded features on the original game, there are more players to buy, and more customisation in the gym. Also you have the option to lay out tactics i.e. make your team more offensive, regular or defensive, the original game never had this. There are more cups to play, and 3 leagues the original only had 2 leagues, and boy the prem league teams are tough, but it offers a challenge at least!, also get some achievments to earn aswelll.Would recommend this for some harmless fun and quick gameplay you shouldn't take it too serious just enjoy it!They still even got the guy saying ""Icecream"" like in the original when you just KO'ed the whole team! lol......

Its is just as adictive, just as frustrating and just as anoying as the original, and when you get it right and score that last second goal from the half way line to clinch the Speedball cup the cheer will be even louder than it was 20 years ago.

												The game is pretty much same as it was when the original Speedball 2 was released.Only graphics has been updated (kind of) and some minor changes were anounced.Basicly you can control which direction your player might go and when he does some kind of action. (Keys are directions + action button). The player that you control switches always to player who is closest to the ball. This might cause some odd situations + keeper gets most of time lost when you suddenly has to control him.All in all. There is no real upgrades in game play. Which could and maybe even should have been made. If you are looking for Speedball 2 copy/port to modern platform this is game for you.If you are excepting some kind of upgrades for original, you won't get any.I like it. If you can get it cheap enought (like from some bundle) then do. Otherwise wait for sales.			"

												A Blast from the past, definitely worth purchasing, especially if you like retro style gaming, for me  Speedball 2 was one of my favourite games on the Sega Genisis (Mega drive) and if like me you loved the original you will no doubt love this game too, as  it is an excellent remake of the original , not an exact copy, but most of the features of the original game are present in SB2HD. (Music is a bit different but suits the atmosphere of the game perfectly)For anyone new to the game I would advise you to manage your team @ the gym spend your cash wisely and keep your team upgrades balanced (including your subs) and don't let the initial speed of the game fool you, once you progress to the latter stages of the game you will find out why it's called speedball :D Get Ready !

												As a grumpy old swine this game took me back to inserting a 3.5"" disk into my Commodore Amiga and reliving some of the joy it bought me back then. It's a proper remastered HD game too not some blocky textured mess designed to con people like me into a nostalgia trip. It's fast, simple and still fun and a very good take on the original (go download a Genesis/Megadrive emulator and get that too) the AI of the higher rated teams can be a bit brutal but after a bit of perseverance and swearing profusely at it you shouldn't have many problems.
