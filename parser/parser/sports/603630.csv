								The kiddos and I really enjoy the puzzles, and the enjoyment we get from trying to figure them out. Simple and fun THANKS for a great free game!			"

								Pretty straight forward game.  If you like making trick shots with rubber balls, you'll like this.			"

								Pretty great, I would like an easy reset function to get the best possible spawn score, but I really enjoyed it.			"

								A ""make the trick shot"" game. Nice minimal visual style. A great free game. Give it a shot!			"

								Give this game a shot, but don't expect much from it in its current state. The poly count is super low, the graphics need a lot of polish, the controls need tweaking, and a lot more minor annoyances that rapidly add up to a negative review.I'll be happy to revisit this later once it's out of alpha and looking and feeling a lot more like a real game. For now, save your hard drive space.			"

								I hate to downvote a free game, but it's honestly not worth your time. The puzzles aren't particularly compelling, and finishing them seems less about thinking or skill, and more about getting that one lucky shot.			"
