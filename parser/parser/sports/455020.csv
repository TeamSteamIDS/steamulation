												Seems OK, not sure it's better than playing with the PokerStars app......it's all a bit too blingy for me.			"

												I tried this game, I had high hopes because I like a good poker game... :(It very quickly became apparent that this is a 0 to low effort mobile port. The entire interface of the game is designed for use with a touchscreen and not a keyboard / mouse. You basically use your mouse cursor in place of a finger and do all the swiping and mobile types of motions.Music vanished once in the actual game, very unappealing.The worst part of this? This version sucks compared to the actual PokerStars client which is far superior and actually funtions like it was meant for PC. Both are free to play... there is absolutely NO reason to play this version at all though. It's actually irrelevant.This same game would actually be alright on tablet or mobile but the way it was ported to PC with no care whatsoever is disgusting. The menus make me want to puke, there is stuff everywhere! The entire screen is covered in garbage - It was meant for a smaller touch screen and not a computer monitor.Nice graphics and colorful art style First Impressions Video, gameplay and thoughts

			This is that free to play poker game by poker stars. It's on steam.. I tried it. I think it must be better on tablet or mobile. I gave it a good try but it just doesn't feel right.		

Don't even bother with this piece of garbage, instead download the actual Pokerstars client from their website if you want to play Poker on PC. Same company but a far superior product.P.S. After you close / exit the game you also need to open up task manager and end process because it seems to run in the background endlessly for no reason after closing.			"

												Jackpot Poker is a pretty simple and decent way to play a variety of casino games. I don't really know how it stacks up to other poker games on Steam as im not a huge fan, but Pokerstars Jackpot Poker seemed alright by itself.			"

												My positive reccomendation somes with the caveat that it only applies if you already want to play poker on PC. I'll put this right up there with Prominence Poker as far as fun. But, where Prominence Poker goes for more slow detail into avatar interactions and such, giving it the feel of actually being at a table with people, PokerStars is basically Zynga Hold'Em++. Which is good - don't fix what isn't broken. The wey cards and cbhips are habndled are must more enjoyable A number of Zynga clone features have been improved - smoother betting, easier to read cards, fast and clear UI. Supposedly you can optionally play on premium currency games to get prizes? So if you're looking for a poker game, this one is one of the best, perhaps next to Prominence Poker.Good:- Excellent art direction- Very good game feel- Fast, fun modesBad:- Crashes when changing to windowed mode- No in-steam friend management- Almost no avatar customization options- No polish outside of playing hands- Coordinating a game with IRL friends seems to be difficult or impossible.

												The only thing I wish this game had was an option to turn just the music off. The music in the menu is far to loud.			"

												The mobile version of Jackpot Poker is really good. Games are fast paced and fun (as you'd expect from a mobile game).This Steam port is total garbage (that's all it is, a bad port of a good mobile game).PROS:- None.CONS:- Crashes more than DC-10s.- Can't type in game. You can only click on preset phrases like ""nice hand"" or ""LOL"".Seriously, even the mobile version gave you the option to type a message (and it was VERY poorly implimented, but at least it was there, this version is actually MISSING features). - You can't choose your own username or use your Steam name. Instead you're automatically GIVEN a stupid randomly generated username that sounds like spam jibberish.-  If you want to change the stupid random name they assign to you,  you have to log in to and connect your Facebook account (I guess your steam account or google play just don't give them the as much free exposure as facebook).- Textures are terrible. With the exception of font; the textures look like jagged overstretched JPEGs. Whichs exactly what they are because they didn't even bother to re-make or even properly upscale anything fom the mobile game.- Private session with friends? Forget about it.So basically comrade, you sit and look at streched out textures and play whichever opponents they decide to give you, using whichever username they decide you get, and say only what they decide you can say,and hope your game doesn't bug out and crash during a match and makes you lose your entire buy-in.Good game for your phone. Complete garbage as a PC game.			"

												(1st Day Review expect alot to change)Not going to do a pro's/ con's just mention things and where they could possibly improve- The controls are pretty well done, i like how you throw the cards to fold etc. though it would be nice if there was an option to turn off click to Raise/Lower, Kept raising the stakes by accident- Looks great in game though main menu feels a little cramped (playing on 32 inch TV at 1080p)-  Please impliment a  Friends list on the main menu that tells me if my friends are in a tourniment or casual table with ability to join/invite (It says you can play with friends but i cant figure out how for the life of me)Overall this is a pretty great poker game, needs a few improvements but perfect isnt to be expected on day 1			"

												YOU CANT CHOOSE YOUR BUYIN!!! HAHAHAHAH! AUTO BUYS IN AT MAX! HAHAHAHA Garbage, This thing immediately throws you in a game without even letting you adjust the settings to how you want them. maybe i dont want to be in full screen! After you are finally able to adjust said full screen setting you cant choose the window size and its super small. So I either have to choose full screen or super small, how freaking stupid is that? Additionally it feels like a tablet port. Obviously designed for mobile devices. Would not recommend. waste of time trying to cash grab from micro transactions. Cant even chat with people in the game, have to use preset responses and there are plenty of other games out there that allow you to chat with people. This game is nothing but flashy lights and microtransactions. OH AND YOU CANT TURN OFF THE BLASTED CRAP MUSIC!!!			"

												P2W ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t. Don't waste your time on this crap. Game is intentionally rigged to make you lose 98% of  your hands so you can just buy chips to stay in the game. Avoid like the plague.			"

Jackpot Poker by PokerStars is way worse than Governor of Poker 3. I waited months for this to be released. But it's terrible. Looks terrible, can't do social stuff, very few modes. Dislike it, play Governor of Poker 3, it's way better.			"

												I try not to give negative reviews, but this is kinda sad.  They get you going with a lot of easy wins.  AA KK are like every 3rd hand.  Then, after a while, it turns into outdraw after outdraw.  The music is kinda obnoxious, I did turn it off.  The poker quiz is not bad to help you get easy chips.  There's nothing at the end of the rainbow except more ""ALL IN""			"

												I dont understand these poker games. Do they honestly expect people to pay them money when I go completly out of chips on the first day?Why wouldn't I just uninstall the game and go play some other poker game? There are like a million of them.So perhaps gives us a damn free play mode so we can try and get to like your game before trying to get our cash			"

												If you're going to port an app from mobile, at least try to differentiate it.No chat, no friending, Not clear you swipe right and left to select different cash levels of tournament.Crashes when mousewheel scrolling the native leaderboards.The poker plays well but come on, I can't forgive this level of laziness.
