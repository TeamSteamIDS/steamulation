												I really enjoyed BasketBelle. One word I would use to describe it is charming. It's a short game, roughly 1 hour, give or take if you try for the final achievement, but it's very well made. This review is a short overview - there's not too much to cover given the game's length, but the execution and charm more than make up for it. Definitely worth playing if you already own it, or if you get on sale - the full price would be fine for people that don't mind game length so much.The story follows a young lad trying to find/ rescue his sister after she is kidnapped. The story has lots of warm moments, and I was pleasantly surprised how in such a short span of time, such vivid feelings were conveyed. You'll see what happens when you play the game, there's not much to elaborate without giving away everything, but the story was sweet and warm.The gameplay uses several mechanics of basketball, and the controls are fairly simple - run right and left, slide, and jump-shot. The simple controls are the basis of some puzzles in the game, and overall I found that it made sense that there weren't complicated controls. The levels all have some different settings and layout, and you'll get the general feeling once you play. Again I was impressed with how the devs progressed the levels and story, and they fit together nicely, in such a short span of time.Overall, I really recommend this game - it's short but the story is charming, the gameplay engaging. This is an example of an indie game made with love and care, and it conveys the feeling to the player well.~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~			"

BasketBelle is a game unlike any other. Creativity and concept is using it's maximum potential. Story gives something different than just empty words, instead promise something new and simple. Every chapter changes gameplay completely, but the main goal still remain the same - slam (jam) dunk. It's hard to classify what is going on in here, but smooth plot and sound make everything fits in. Ending give that feeling of insufficiency and after finishing BasketBelle little whisper inside me was awaken - MOAR!

												What is BasketBelle?Well, BasketBelle is a simple piece of art where you control your main character with the four arrows and X to use the mechanics of basketball in an easy 2D platform adventure game.There is not much to say about this game, it is very short but each chapter feels unique. It takes about an hour to play through the game for the first time, and then much less since you know how to do everything. You have to replay the two final chapters at least two times to get all achievements, which is a bit annoying but not too bad if you know what to do. All in all, it takes around 90-120 minutes to get all achievements.Would I recommend BasketBelle? As a game, no. The gameplay is nice and a bit varied, but it is too short, Once you went through the game, you saw it all, there is no replay value.As a piece of art, yes. Definitely play through it once, enjoy the (crazy but not too good) story, the art style and how the unusual visuals, the gameplay and the music fit together!Recommended: Play through it if you have it. If you don't have it, wait for a good sale or skip this title entirely.(I wished there was a neutral option on Steam, but so I vote yes!)			"

												Okay, I personally cannot say anything new that hasn't been already said on other reviews.So I'll keep it simple:For the 5€ (or less due possible discounts and such), you'll get ""complete""-version of ""BasketBelle"". This includes the Original-Soundtrack (or ""Extended Plays"", to be precise) alongside digital-version of the sketchbook (or art-book, according to some).And since the developer has allowed the following link to shared freely, here is the ""behind-the-scenes""-video:http://basketbelle.net/makingof/This is a neat little experience-game which is quite easy to get into and especially play-through due the amount of fairness, a thing quite uncommon nowadays.((Granted, this is review of mine isn't all that helpful necessarily, so I do again recommend reading through others' reviews for more details and such.))

												I've never been a big fan of sports. Despite being extremely competitive and athletic there's just something about traditional sports that bores me to tears. That said, there's always been something almost ethereal to me about shooting hoops with a basketball, transcending my typical dislike of sports into something simply delightful. BasketBelle sort of taps into that sort of feeling, beginning as a basic basketball game but quickly veering into strange and imaginative directions with only an ever bouncing sphere to keep us grounded.There's a very heartfelt elegance to BasketBelle, as if the adventure we're going on is as unknown and limitless to the developer as it is to us. Though it takes but thirty minutes to play through, every moment of the experience is so creative and sweetly framed that it conveys a far more meaningful and touching narrative than its brief length would have you expect. The relationship between the nameless protagonist and his little sister, Belle, is beautiful in its playful innocence, not needing to be complex or troubled to turn these faceless purple people into characters I could relate to and which made me smile.Sure, BasketBelle's gameplay is fairly limited, its controls anything but smooth, and its length incredibly brief, but none of that really mattered to me. The imagination and love flowing through the constantly evolving journey was all I needed to allow me to sink into its gorgeous backgrounds as I dribbled with alien monsters, learned to fly, and bonded with my sister all in time for bed. I would have gladly spent much longer in such a delightful world, but what's here is an almost perfect expression of a developer's odd idea that turned into something rather lovely. Good show, Bean!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												If you’ve ever found yourself playing a sports game and thought it might be improved by a touching story and surreal puzzles, I’ve got great news! BasketBelle is a charming, unique, and interesting game that does just that. Essentially a story of a young, dunk-obsessed boy searching for his sister, this short but sweet game offers gameplay that’s entirely its own. With a paper-cutout Paris as its backdrop and a collection of strange, surreal monsters and puzzles, this curious and charming game is truly original and deeply intriguing.BasketBelle opens with a short narrative bit showing our hero learning the basics of basketball from his father. After a new member of the family, Belle, is introduced, we see our young protagonist practicing his skills with her as she grows. A bizarre happening one day when their beloved orange ball rolls away from the family hoop leads to a mind-bending adventure against tentacle-like monsters, leading our champion on a quest to reunite with his lost sister, overcoming puzzles with his court-earned abilities and attempting to rescue her from the twisting grasp of these unearthly beasts.BasketBelle, while short, is broken into several chapters, each of which featuring a unique set of rules and challenges to overcome. The first chapter sets up learning how to play and getting the hang of the controls with straightforward basketball action. Later chapters feature everything from block-pushing puzzles to sky-soaring chases, each making use of these same skills and abilities. You’ll run, jump, slide, and shoot your way to the end of each chapter, getting ever closer to finding your lost sister, armed only with her cute yellow backpack and your father’s treasured basketball.What makes BasketBelle unique is, frankly, nearly everything. With a great, if simple, art style, curious mechanics, and soothing downtempo soundtrack, there’s nothing in the game that seems like anything else I’ve played. While the rules and play within each chapter are consistent, the constant shift from one chapter to the next keeps the play engaging and fresh as you progress. Throwing in a heartfelt story of family and love, this title brings a whole court of imaginative features that stand out as a truly special experience.With its one-of-a-kind art and play, BasketBelle creates a fantastical, strange, and touching story. While it’s short, the 4,99€ price includes the game, soundtrack, digital sketchbook, and a making-of featurette by developer Bean. You’re not likely to get a ton of play, but by keeping the price low and tossing in these extras, you’re certainly not throwing away your money by picking this one up. A definite recommendation for those with an appreciation of games as art, my only disappointment here is that there’s not more of it to explore.			"

												BasketBelle is a brief, endearing adventure with heart and style. Despite the name, BasketBelle is not filled with basketball in the typical sense. Small parts of the game have you playing some one on one, but mostly this a whimsical bit of puzzle platforming. In this linear experience, some reflex is involved in order to traverse the various platforms and pathways. Shooting the ball takes a bit more effort and aim, but feels satisfying. The few matches of basketball present in the game are fair and not too challenging. Players will find themselves dribbling, hopping on platforms, and making shots in mostly surreal environments with many hues of purple. The controls can feel wonky at times, but this isn’t meant to a demanding experience like Super Meat Boy, so it never really felt like a major issue. Instead, this is one of those games that’s more for the experience than to challenge the player. The experience is definitely enjoyable, but on the shorter side of just around an hour or two.The pacing of the game suits the length well, so there is very little downtime between levels and cuts of narrative. The game feels like it’s constantly in motion, save for the few more puzzle oriented levels, but even at its most difficult it can still probably be enjoyed by wide range of skill levels and age groups. The story follows a young boy trying to save his sister as she is kidnapped by a purple blob. Despite the rather simple and lighthearted presentation, BasketBelle manages to pinch at emotions carefully and confidently. At its heart the familial narrative is touching and pleasant. There is no fiery grandeur in the prose or obscurity in the delivery, but it is refreshing and sincere.BasketBelle is a short and simple treat. The novel art style does an excellent job carrying the game’s experience and the music accompanies well. The length is not enough to cavil about, but the controls might be enough to put off those not charmed by BasketBelle’s winsome visuals and character. BasketBelle is concise and splendid.			"

												Yeah I am on the fence about this one. You can certainly do better for five bucks, which is my main gripe. My second gripe is the controls. This game certainly has some quirky indie storytelling love that I have to give it credit for. It tells a fairly uplifting story about a family.Pros:+Great music and ambience+Great story that is very positive and uplifting+Its short, which I like for indie titles - leave me slightly wanting more instead of wearing out the welcomeCons:-Controls are awful - I want to use AWSD instead of arrow keys, and also - jump is the same button as shoot which is screwy, although that is part of the puzzle I guess-No full screen mode full screen mode is hard to find but you just push 'f' apparently, and the window is not resizable which means I am only using literally 1/4 my screen-$5 is a bit overpriced considering what other games you can get for thisGreat excercise in indie game storytelling, but the awful controls with the puzzle component drove me to not recommend it.

""Dunk for your life and get your daughter back""Pretty cool basketball platformer in the city of Paris.A dad is teaching his son for basketball and prepare his daughter Belle for school with a backpack as present. In a sudden moment alien blobs kidnap his daughter. So he must fight in several basketball matches the alien blobs to get her back. The fantasy of this game is brilliant. Like being inside a stomach of an alien blob, fighting against cheating tentacles, flying above the clouds during a storm or climb up the golden Eiffel tower.Very cool are the dribbling beats that fit perfectly to the soundtrack. And I also liked the dunk mode and the challenging puzzles. The game has 3 different endings. Depends on how many rings you catch at the end scene during a collapsing Eiffel tower.

												Fun little game and really unique.  It seems like a strange combination to combine platforming, basketball, and a story that focuses on family ,but I enjoyed it.  Some of the basketball dynamics were a lot of fun.  I think the art style worked in giving the whole thing an otherworldly feel. There is a good amount of variety in the level design so, for me, it didn't get repetitive.  It's a short game, but there are three different endings depending on your score on level 7.  This means that you don't have to play through the entire game to see the different endings - once you beat it the first time, you can just restart on level 7 and try for the different scores that show the different endings.

Aside from the great art and cute plot, you will experience a brilliant 'platformer' game in a mission to save little sister Belle.This game will appeal to fans of: art, platformers, and basketballThe only significant downfall of this game is the length of it, as it is very possible to complete the game in a 30 minute sitting.It's a great game for those looking for a fun, quick, and beautiful experience!

												BasketBelle is a short ""art game"" based on basketball with approximately 30 minutes worth of playtime. While the exact game genre varies depending on your current objective, it usually varies between a puzzle game with mild platforming elements and an action game in which you have to dodge obstacles.Generally I'm not the biggest fan of art games, but the scenes of the main character with his family were well-done and clicked with me, and the plot steadily getting more and more over-the-top was pretty great, too. The music is also amazingly synchronized to the gameplay action, as apparently the game design started out as an experiment in, well, synchronizing music with gameplay action.I wholeheartedly recommend BasketBelle if you're in the mood for a short and well-crafted interactive experience - the only real downside is that it doesn't have all that much replay value and is only about 30 minutes long, but on the other hand, that's exactly how long it should be.

												The simple blurb on the games on store page says it all.  Each level is completely unique in the platforming or other mechanics required to figure out the level and progress in the story.  Not overly hard but that fits the games gentle and cute charm.  The music plays in harmory with the game and its level mechanics also superbly.  LOVE the art style and overall feel of the game.  Indie games often either get the unique art style OR some unique and clever mechanics down.  This does both.  Sure its short but I have no problem with under 2 hour games as long as they are under $5.  This game=well worth it even for someone who far prefers the belles to the baskets.			"

Short version: 72%Mid-90s basketball craze meets a short platformer. The early levels start out quite bad, but the latter half of the game is a fun little side-scroller to pass the time with.Long version:BasketBelle is an experimental game by one-man indie studio Bean! As the name suggests, this one is all about basketball, which is reflected in everything in the game.The creator managed to capture the essence of the mid-90s– often referred to as the golden age of basketball– without somehow invoking all the bad of that era. The art style is hip, but not obtrusive. The music is upbeat, but not ciphering. The dialogues are laid-back, but just in the right way.One of the biggest complaints I have about BasketBelle is that it starts horribly as a game: the tutorial sets the right mood, but the next stage is just a boring and tedious puzzle platformer. This is why most people never experience the later exciting high-speed chases and streetball puzzles. They should though, as they are rather fun!			"

BasketBelle has an interesting concept. It's a platformer with a great and touching story. I really like the artistic elements of the game. The visuals are superb, as I said, the story is touching and the audio is pretty neat as well. The only real downside is the gameplay itself. Apart from the, more or less, innovative basketball elements, it's a poorly made puzzle platformer. Terrible optimization and the control is even worse.			"

												If you are looking for a basketball game, this is not what you are looking for.BasketBelle is... a strange hybrid of two completely different kinds of games, one is basically a NBA Jam clone, and the other is a puzzle solver, that's interesting, right?The problem is, it fails at both.Basketbelle tries to be different by switching these game modes over levels to make the gameplay look like it's nothing we've never seen before,  this wouldn't be bad, if it was displayed properly, but the issue here is that the way the game is built makes this extremely confusing.When you start the game, you first think you'll be playing basketball with different kinds of oponents, to later switch to become a puzzle solver, in an honest opinion, the basketball sections are far more fun than the puzzles, as these last ones came as annoying, too simple, and I'll go as far as to consider them unnecesary. This game also has no replay value, by the end of the game you'll be so frustrated with it you won't want to touch it again, as the final segment of it isn't really fun, it's just trial and error that will keep you frustrated for at least 15 minutes, and the rest of the game doesn't help to want you to try it again either.Sound department has some issues, certain SFX made my ears hurt because they were too loud and they played too often, other than that, I have to admit the idea of mixing the ball's hits with the music is clever, and adds emotion into it, another positive is the art department as it makes everything look like a drawn dream. Basketbelle, you tried, but this feels more like a flash game experience more than it feels like a game.4/10 "

												Basketbelle is a great non-traditional platformer.  It has a beautiful art-style, a touching and engaging narrative and a wonderful soundtrack.  The basketball themed platforming gameplay is enjoyable, but I also don't think that the gameplay is what really drives this game, rather the narrative and ambience.  The game itself is around 30 minutes long, and I easily got all the achievement in the game within an hour.I can't recommend this game to everyone, as I know not everyone shares my values when it comes to games.  While the game has 3 endings, after seeing all of them, I don't think there is much replay value.  And while the game is very inexpensive (and in my opinion, well worth full price), others may not find the amount of gameplay justifiable for the price.  In my opinion, though, there are a few games (like Gone Home and Thomas was Alone) that allow you to look back and value the experience as a whole long after you have completed the game, and Basketbelle is another addition to that list.  So, if you are the type of person that resented Gone Home for the game-time/money ratio, than you may not be that into this game (although 5 bucks is hard to beat).My other (somewhat) warning is that I think reading the genre as platformer may be somewhat misleading to peoples' expectations.  This game is definitely unique, and plays differently than any other platformer.  It is not a difficult game by any stretch of the imagination, and I think that with many games (like Super Meat Boy) the gameplay comes first, where as with Basketbelle, the gameplay is very much secondary, and is a vehicle for the experience.  The gameplay is good, but definitely secondary.Anyways, that is enough trying to appeal to people that are unlike me in a review, if you are at all an 'indie game nerd', this game is a no-brainer.  I loved the concept, the aesthetic, the story, and how all of these were carried out.  I also think that the price is worth it for the EP alone, this game has a great soundtrack.  There were also some neat little touches, like, when your character idled, the sound of him dribbling the ball formed a clave against the soundtrack.  I decided to play this game after really enjoying Soundodger+ (also by Studio Bean) and its sound track, and was not disappointed at all.  If you want to try something new and fresh, this is definitely a game to check out.			"

												Being a basketball fan going in I wasn't quite sure how a basketball platform game would work. The controls are fairly simple, mainly alot of sliding, jumping, and taking jump shots or dunking the ball. The story is kind of crazy but fun, albeit a little short... You may be able to beat this in under 30 minutes. But somehow this odd mesh of sports and platforming puzzler game made it a fairly enjoyable play through. All in all for a quick casual game this was decent enough for me to play through after getting it at a good price in a bundle.			"

BasketBelle can be completed in under and hour, though for those that enjoy story driven games this is one worth playing. It's the perfect length without it starting to feel repetitive. Once you grasp the concept of one mechanic the game immediately introduces a new mechanic which each level serving the story. The game seamlessly blends gameplay with story  to give you a unique gaming experience. An excellent example of how powerful gaming can be in telling a story. Highly Recommended, and must buy on special.			"

												It's stylish and have a solid theme going, and the basketball play is almost owherwhelmingly cool as you first dive in. But then the platforming begins. It's awkward and sluggish. Hitboxes and controls are inexact to the point where it's painful. And the puzzles doesn't help at all.From a feeling of ""wow, game of the year"" to literally ♥♥♥ in less then a minute. Nice try though. It does have potential.			"

												It's an alright game, gorgeous artstyle, cute little story, pretty short, controls feel kinda sloppy for a platforming game. If you're into artsy games I recommend it. Would have liked more basketball-elements in the game somehow, but that would have been difficult, since it's a 2D-game.			"

												Very beautiful platformer!  None of the mechanics overstay their welcome, so it is quite short (~45 minutes for me).There's really not much to criticise, except that it took me quite a while to adjust myself to the zoom (I like my platforming to be more ""zoomed out"", with more view of the level), the gratuitious film grain,and the damsel-in-distress narrative (from the title, I had hoped for a basketball-playing girl instead of a boy as the protagonist).It may not be worth full price to you since it is so short, but if you chance to pick it up (I got it on a current indiegala bundle), be sure to play!

												This game is poetry in motion.  I remember begging all of my friends to vote for this game on greenlight.  I had never played it before on Desura or otherwise until it came out on Steam.  I was hoping for an extremely unique experience and i was not disappointed.Basketbelle is a game of its own.  If it were to be categorized it would be....well it would be it's own genre.  One could say ""music based"", or ""platformer"", ""puzzle"",  or even ""sports"".   It has the basics of all of those, but in reality it is none of those in a complete sense.  Music plays throughout the game, and to the beat of your dribbles, but the game is not totally dependent on that.  There are platforming elements in the game, but those become more based on solving puzzles than the platforming itself. You shoot baskets to complete levels and beat enemies, but those baskets are just as much about the puzzles and platforming as they are about the shots themselves.   The music also plays its role in how you play.The graphics in this game are what you may call ""minimalistic"" but in the many many years ive been gaming i've never seen an art style/graphics quite like this.  The look it has is truly unique.The game itself is a complete circle of multiple elements from multiple genres put together to create a totally unique game.  It is very short (I beat it in less than an hour) but if you like fresh, well made games this is well worth the price of admission for 5 bucks.Please upvote this if you agree with my review and/or like this game!  I'd really love as many people as possible to give this game a try so show them your love!!!  :)			"

												BasketBelle is really more of an experiment than a game. You take on the role of a young, purple b-baller roaming the streets of Paris in search of his lost sister. Each of the game's scenes requires you to run, jump, slide, and dunk to beat your opponents, usually amorphous purple blobs standing in your way. The mechanics are simple but are tested in many different ways, sometimes in battles on the court, sometimes in platforming puzzles, and sometimes in high-speed flight sequences.To describe the game any further would be to spoil the themes or the story. And that would be quite the disservice, considering the game is only about thirty minutes long. Most of the gameplay is very straightforward, and I only found myself briefly stuck on one particular puzzle. The art style is excellent and the sound design supports it well. Obviously BasketBelle isn't going to keep you busy for long or become your new favorite game, but if you get the chance to play it, it's well worth the time for the surreal journey and adorable story.

												Basketbelle is a unique game all around, but it is really short, and while we shouldn't compare the length of a game to it's price, being able to complete a game that costs 5€ in 30 minutes isn't very good.Pros. :+ this game mixes basket and puzzle, and while yes, the puzzles are easy, they're here and they're what make this game unique.+ the artstyle is fantastic, that is all.Cons. :- 5€ for 30 minutes of gameplay, I don't like comparing the price of a game to it's length, but this is perhaps a bit too bighonestly, I don't have much else to add to this, there's not a lot to talk about, the best thing you can do is to try it for yourself, really.Final Rating: 8/10			"

												I recommend this game only if you're curious about 2d platformers with new ideas. The new idea here is pleasant, and the mechanic generally works ok. It could have been pushed a lot further, but it suffices. It also has a really nice music-basketball sound interaction. However, I'm not broadly recommending it. It has some really confusing spots, a less than ideal camera angle, and the basketball mechanic isn't introduced very clearly (even in the end I don't know how to win vs the ""mirror"" me - what blocks and what doesn't). It's also painfully short, only realy 5-6 puzzles and you're done, and a more than healthy dose of repetition in some of the most boring bits.In summary, for 2d platformer fans this is an interesting curio, for everyone else, there are many better 2d platformers.

												I highly recommend BasketBelle.Just finished playing it and have a deep respect for the storytelling and game design.  The Indigestion chapter was one of the most clever puzzle platformer sequences I've seen in a while.  The flight chapters were thrilling and clever in execution.The basketball mechanics throughout whether minimal or front-and-center in the level were intuitive and fluid.  Even the tutorial and source of title was melded into the narrative.Which comes to the point that the story indeed steals the show.  The flashes of the boy remembering his sister, the loving father, the banter of siblings.  Even the enemies have a background that makes sense.Be prepared to feel for these characters.  Not what you might expect from a platformer that can take less than an hour to complete.Studio Bean made a sports game relevant in a platformer space with a touching story to boot.  Kudos.NOTE - For those who care about bang for the buck, this week there's even less excuse with IndieGala's Monday bundle that I bought for around $2. ;)			"

												BasketBelle is an experimental Basketball-platformer-puzzle arcade game.While the game itself is very simple each section offers it's own unique challenge and mechanics, wither it's playing in a one-on-one basketball game with a person or monster, using your basketball to solve platforming puzzles or flying through the sky avoiding obstacles. Each section is short and sweet and could have been developed into their own much larger/longer games but here they last just long enough to give you a taste before the next course of this delightful meze.Visually the game looks amazing like a pastel drawing full of blues purples and yellows. The sound design also deserves a mention with an excellent soundtrack that just matches the games mood and feel. The game also has a interesting narrative, while simply told through cut-scenes and gameplay it culminates in a beautiful and charming little story.  On the downside the controls feel a little loose and floaty, which isn't a massive problem as it doesn't require a great deal of accuracy and precision, but can be a little frustrating in certain areas. The game is also rather short being able to be finished in under an hour. Three of the four achievements are unlocked while playing through the story, the fourth involves replaying the last segment a couple of times to get the slight ending variations. There are no hidden secrets or items, no extra levels to unlock just the main experience.Thankfully that main experience is very enjoyable for the time that it lasts. At time of writing the game sells for about £4 (£3.99GBP) and is certainly worth the asking price, not too much for such a short game with relatively little replay value other than the fact you could quickly share the game with friends. If this doesn't sound like something you'd like I'd still recommend checking it out when it's on sale. Quick Summary+ Varied Gameplay+ Lovely Visuals and Soundtrack + Simple but enjoyable gameplay- Short- Floaty controls- No replayability			"

												It felt like a lot of work went into making this game feel the way it does. The sound design is spot on with the visuals, so every action the player takes feels incredibly responsive, you could almost play this game with your eyes closed thanks to how distinct the audio cues are.I greatly appreciate the length of it as well, each level plays with a core mechanic a bit, you learn how to do something and then you move on. There's nothing repetitive about it and that's how I like my games. Doing things over and over becomes a chore and this neatly avoids that.			"

												The best aspect of this game is its presentation: the cardboard visuals is very striking and the music is great as well (I especially loved the track for Chapter 4). The mix of ambient sound and hip-hop beats really sets the tone for the game. However, the gameplay falls apart because of the unresponsive, clunky controls. I felt extremely frustrated playing Chapters 3, 5, 6, and 7 and beating those chapters was based more on luck than skill. The gameplay concept in Chapter 2, combining puzzle-platforming with shooting a basketball, is interesting, but the rest of the chapters were unoriginal (one chapter is basically Flappy Bird). As for the story, it was.. fine? Scrolling through the other reviews I'm clearly in the minority but I didn't find the story particularly memorable, charming, or interesting. To sum up my opinion, great visuals and music but the gameplay really ruined my experience.			"
