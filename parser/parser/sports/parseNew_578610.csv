												great game that gives lots of fun! nice neon looks and tron-like feeling. you don't need a very large room as the ball always keeps coming back towards the player. it's a steal for not even 5.- bucks.			"

												This simpleness of this game is what really makes it attractive.  Think racketball mixed with nitro.  The music is top notch and the sounds are very retro-chique.  Everything in the game seems to just flow really nicely and nothing seems out of place at all.  It's the perfect combo of a retro bartop arcade game, and a fast action VR game.  Basic controls and mechanics makes this really easy to pickup for 10-15 mins here or there and sweat it out a bit.  It really is a lot more work than it looks!

												Fun game, it’s pretty much Super Glove Ball taken to the next level.  Love this game, wish there were more levels :P			"

												Very basic but very fun game. This is exactly what we need more of in VR - simple but fun and replayable games, especially those which are based off well established game mechanics (we know they work!). I do wish there were more features, but for the price I can't really complain. Features I would add: a way to check the leaderboard (scroll through/etc.), graphics options (it drops FPS frequently for me), and multiplayer (pvp and/or coop) would be insane. Overall great game!

Super Pixel Smash is balls deep in retro awesomeness.I'm a fan of the concept: pong-like, breakout-like 3D game set in a void filled with neon-lit squares.  It's a simple concept, sure, but it's hardly ever done well, and the genre's still kind of new for roomscale mechanics.  Oh, boy, is it perfect for roomscale.  The only caveat is the cable management, of course.  That said, this game still suffers from some design flaws.The music and general sound design are awesome.  The gameplay is kind of dull from a front-facing perspective, but moving around the room to hit the ball in a variety of ways feels awesome.  I especially like hitting the ball upward to make it hit the floor and ceiling several times before I hit it toward the wall I'm supposed to be aiming at.  The one problem I have with the gameplay is it's too easy to get the ball to move quickly.  That should require more force, more effort.  I did, however, find the hit detection a little glitchy and not as friendly toward quick movements of the controller.  It works fine to just hover the controller where the ball will hit, but that's like playing a game of pong: boring!  Anyway, it's a good game design, but it could use some tweaking.  One suggestion I have is to add game modes so we can play different stages with additional difficulties and obstacles.Oh, and yeah, big fan of Accel World.  ;)			"
