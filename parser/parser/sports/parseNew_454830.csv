								Okay, believe it or not this game is weirdly fun.Yes I know it looks dumb. I expected to play it for about 30 seconds and shut it off.But the interactions with the beach balls are tactile and satisfying, and I enjoyed spawning dozens of them & smashing them with my wooden arms. There's also a simple minigame where you can bounce them through targets for points. Like I said, weirdly fun.HOWEVER, in its current state I can't recommend it, not even as an EA title. I ran out of things to do in about 10 minutes.I've played a lot of VR tech demos and this one actually feels ripe for all kinds of little activities. A touch of relaxing music, 2-3 juicier envrionments (a beach would be a nice start) and some more ways to interact with the bouncy balls and you could have a wonderfully theraptic game that would easily be worth $2.99 (or more).If you want to help the devs come up with ideas to expand on this then it might be worth it, because I do think there's something worth exploring here. Otherwise hang on to your $2.99 for now.(I'll be keeping an eye on this one & will update my review as it develops)			"

								Beach balls that look and feel really good and if you're going to whack them then why not with a pizza peel paddle? It's possible to knock balls for huge distances, bounce and add spin. I enjoyed this a lot more than i expected to and i think it's because beach balls don't have the mass and resistance you expect with tennis or basketballs so they feel right in VR .    There could be a really satisfying and  different Selfie Tennis type game or some sort of weird relaxation activity here as the physics are great. I'm intrigued to see where this goes but it needs more of a purpose than the game currently delivers.			"

								This is the perfect game to play when you're chilling out between a hard game of Space Pirate Trainer or Audioshield. It's relaxing, fun, and there's a bunch of great stuff coming in future releases. I love beach balls!			"

								100% worth the 3â‚¬ :) Really calming, and surprisingly fun. The dev/devs really nailed the physics, so it's really satisfying to whack beach balls around.			"

								Bought the game because I stumbled on one of the dev's videos on youtube and he seems like a cool guy.  The game is good to introduce non gamers to VR and motion controllers.			"

								The game takes place in a vast epic world where you are standing on the wall of a castle...You stand in this relaxing environment where you swat beach balls in a realistic manner that are being ejected from the castle tower.The game is very bright and colorful and and over nice soothing environment to be in.  Hitting beach balls is oddly satisfying and feels almost real.Not much of a game here, but worth checking out as a tech demo.			"

								Plenty fun to be had.  Early days for this game, but it could grow in to quite a nice experience. There's something timeless about trying to get a ball through a hoop... launching the beachballs down the hillside was a nice surprise. Controls need a bit more explanation and clarity, and a TP feature and Dart Blower would be great to take out some of the beachballs. But a fun wee distraction which I'll give to some people to play around with during my demos of the Vive :). Thanks for creating and thanks for sharing.			"
