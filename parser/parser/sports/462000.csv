												Since HoloBall just came out a few days before Cyberpong, I think many people will be wondering what the differences are and if it's worth owning both.In single player, Cyberpong VR is best described as VR Breakout with a dash of Tetris.  Blocks spawn at the back of the arena and slowly move towards you.  You destroy them with bouncing balls and powerups until a block makes it to your side.  Then the game is over.  There's strategy in how you save and use the powerups, and skill in juggling and aiming the many balls.The suprise for me was PvP multiplayer, where it plays like VR Pong.  There are no powerups or blocks, just returning the ball back and forth as it becomes faster and faster.  It sounds simple, and it is, but being face to face in VR with your opponent brings so much to the game.  It's an absolute blast.  Shoutout to Shaquille who beat me easily 5 games straight.Cyberpong will have you moving all around the required play area, but it doesn't push you to swing with the same vigor that HoloBall does.  I've had to take a break for a few days from HoloBall for my arm to recover.  Cyberpong brings my pulse up, but doesn't wear me out.TL;DR: While Cyberpong VR and HoloBall look similar, they play very differently, and both are great fun.  The online multiplayer in Cyberpong VR is an absolute must try.			"

												I never thought I'd break a sweat while playing Pong. That is, until I played Cyberpong VR.Cyberpong VR's gameplay is exciting and makes for great competition. Its single-player is fun and easy to dive into and play, albeit short-lived due to a lack of progression or Story Mode. Where the game truly shines is in multiplayer where you face off with an opponent in a Pong style duel. There aren't many muliplayer VR games currently available, and this one was executed in a great manner. Seeing the body language of your opponent will make you excited for what's to come in the future of VR.Additionally, unlike many virtual reality titles currently available, Cyberpong VR is priced affordably. It's a great pick-up for a new HTC Vive owner.You can read my full review here:http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/cyberpong-vr "

												This is the game I put the most hours in in VR, my go to workout program. I am currently #3 in Global Ranking in single player, right at 17 minutes. The game might seem simplistic and too easy at first, not giving penalties for losing your ball like most brick breakers do. But after playing a few hours did I realize that the real goal in single player is to stay in the game as long as possible. The difficult exponentially scales, and it becomes intense and chaotic to stay in the game. Kudos to the devs for making one of the more polished games for VR early on, although there are a few serious bugs to be fixed.Get this game, and look at it as a workout program, I think you'll end up loving it as I do.

												I'm guessing a lot of people are considering whether to buy this or Holoball.  Well, here're my thoughts as someone who owns both:**NOTE: The following paragraph no longer applies; the Cyberpong team quickly changed the mechanics of the game to allow for smashing and controling the ball to a much, much greater extent.  You don't have to, but you can speed up the pace of the game quite significantly if you do.Holoball responds to how you hit the ball more than Cyberpong.  Holoball really is more like raquetball, and if you're looking for that smash-hit feeling, then Holoball is what you want.  For me, smashing it ends up straining my elbow after a short play-time, and I start feeling it there before actually working up a sweat.Cyberpong is more polished, period.  The powerups, the tetris-meets-breakout singleplayer mode, the various characters that have different paddles (although, let's be real here - the default paddle is the best paddle), all of that just makes for a more fleshed-out game.  I played through Holoball and was done with it after about an hour.  I'm still playing single player Cyberpong trying to best my highest time.And finally, multiplayer.  I'm reserving my judgement until I see what the Holoball team does, but suffice it to say that this is the main selling point for Cyberpong right now.  It lags a bit, but only the interactions between the ball and the other player.  You never have a problem making contact with the ball (i.e. the ball never lags through your hand or anything).  It's incredibly simple - just barebones pong against another person - but that's all it needs to be.  Facing off against another human being who can wave to you, taunt a bit, sympathize when something crazy happens.  You feel the company, and it's fantastic.All in all, I'd recommend this over Holoball as of right now.			"

												I heard good things about this game so I picked it up; it was worth every penny! Single player is a Breakout-style game with powerups, and multiplayer is a traditional game of Pong except in VR. I love how you can see your opponent's movements in multiplayer, as it makes it feel like you're actually playing a virtual game of Pong with someone else.This game is very easy to pick up and play, and I can't wait to play more later on! They recently added a level editor so I plan on checking that out and seeing what I can make.			"

												Cyber Pong VR is a retro styled modern pong game for the HTC Vive. The two Vive controllers are transformed into two paddles which you use to hit the ball. It is your task to use the ball to destroy the blocks before they get to close to the grid. If things get to hard, you can transform you peddles into special weapons like a gun, grabber or a bigger peddle.All blocks have their own special abilities. The purple ones throw an orbs towards you, green blocks give an extra ball and the red blocks will explode. You can give the ball direction by curving your paddles. The harder you hit the ball the faster it will go.The gameplay feels very natural and the visualization in the game is very clear and stylish. There isn´t a big learning curve, although I recommend playing the tutorial first. In the tutorial you´ll learn about the colored blocks and how you can use the special weapons. You´ll have to move yourIn the single player mode, you can drill your skills. If you hold on long enough you will earn a place at the online and local leaderboard. The longer you can keep the blocks away, the higher you’ll rank.The best thing about Cyber Pong VR is the multiplayer option, although finding an online competitor in these early days of VR can be quite difficult. The developers have well-conceived, since there is a small mini game available while you’re waiting. There is also a LAN option available for those who like to compete in the same room.The game offers a really small learning curve and after playing for about five minutes I was fully immerged into the virtual environment. After ten minutes I started to get the hang of it and that motived to move quicker, dive for the ball, run around and really put some effort into getting a good high score.Cyber Pong VR is a game that can be played endlessly and stays entertaining every time you start playing it. You can compare it a bit like the original Pong, Breakout and Tetris from the 70s, 80s and 90s, these games are still fun to play as well. Big difference with this one is that I´m exhausted after playing for longer than an hour. Great fun and exercise at the same time! Now I only need to get myself a waterproof VR Cover.

												One of the best games that I’ve played on VRCyberpong provides a lot of fun and competitive challenges even though it’s easy to learn for both adults and kidsI checked out some reviews about this game, but had no problem with lags or chaperone bounds. Pros: + Solid game play and polished environment + No motion sickness + Easy to pick up, but challenging + Great workout with room scale movement + Multi-player mode Cons: - Need more competitive game content like weekly leaderboard I can’t help, but wait for future updatesIf you have Vive, this is the game you must try out			"

												Like A-10 VR, I think this game suffers from its name.  This is not a pong game -- it's not even close to what Holoball is trying to do (other than the fact that the game happens to involve a ball).  If this game were named Cyberarkanoid VR, or Cyberbreakout VR, or anything other than containing the word 'pong,' I feel like there would be less unfortunate comparison with something it's not.In any case, this game is super fun, and a compelling little arcade blockbreaker.  The force feedback of the paddles is well-implemented, and the later stages of the game get good and frantic.  I find myself wishing for more single-player modes, but the one mode it has is really good.  I've demoed it to a couple folks as a room-scale experience and everybody has liked it a lot.			"

												My main problem with this game, and it's a huge problem I think, is that it maps the playable area to your chaperone bounds exactly.Couple that with the tiny size of the paddles, and this means you'll be swinging your Vive controllers - at high speeds - right at the bounds of your chaperone, which is usually where you have walls and floors and furniture and what not. I can't tell you how many times I've hit my controllers against stuff, and how many balls I've missed because I'm too afraid to swing at my chaperone bounds.I can't believe the developers haven't thought about this. Look at Holoball, which does it right: in Settings, you can set a padding area from your chaperone that basically narrows down your playing field so you're not swinging at the edges. And the paddles are larger in Holoball.In Cyberpong, the default paddles don't even extrude past the controller. No, for that you have to use an ""ability"" or select another character with long but extra narrow paddles. Utterly ridiculous.Beyond that, it's... eh. It's way too claustrophobic. And the balls are slow, and the shape and position of the paddle makes swings awkward.			"

												This is an awesome game.  In fact, this is my favorite Vive game.  I keep coming back to play this.  It is very different than Holoball.   I also get a very good workout especially when multiball is active.  I read the negative comment about slowing down when many balls are released.  I did not find that's the case at all.  I can hardly keep it up when that happens.  This game is quite polished compared to Holoball.    I was a little skeptical before buying this.  It may not be as a good deal as Holoball pricewise, but I found myself more addicted to this game. I have not yet tried multiplayer though.  Everyone's taste is different.  But I highly recommend this game. "

												This is a really fun one for the Vive, and I think is sneakily exercise- you can get a little sweaty!Multiplayer is my favorite- it's not easy to find a partner randomly, you may have to coordinate, but when you do it is a lot of fun. Being able to see a real person in the game with you makes all the difference. Social virtual reality is an exciting frontier and this is a step towards it- even if it is just a head and hands for now!The breakout (single player) endless mode is also fun. The powerups add a twist, and you definitely feel that pressure to last a little longer than you did last time. It gets intense!It's a simple concept but clearly a lot of effort was put into the details, the art style is really cool and the multiplayer really makes it stand out. Recommend! "

												Most used game on my Vive and a great one to use to show friends - it's simple to understand and once you get enough balls going it's an insanely good work out.  (If you're tired, you can use the longer paddle size, less energy needed)Two long standing bugs I've noticed that can be worked around:  - Never use any power ups except gun and rocket, the ""big paddle"" one will screw up the positioning offset to your hand.- Never just choose ""Play again"" but quit back to the main menu instead.  If you don't, the block difficulty will sometimes not reset and just continue from where your last game was.GET IT!			"

												I wanted to like this game, and there is nothing as such wrong with the gameplay, but a few things detract from the experience:* The game displays a grid that looks a bit like the chaperone grid. In the heat of things its very easy to mistake the two and try to reach beyond your play space. Lets just say its a good thing the controllers are sturdy.* The physics of the balls and paddle seems a bit off somehow, i cant put my finger on what exactly it is.I am sure this game will become better with a few updates, but right now there are better experiences out there.

												Since apparently I'm just buying anything that comes out for VR now like a lot of other people, I bought this after seeing it pop up in the store. Holoball had released earlier, and I really like that game. HB is closer to actual Pong in VR, while Cyberpong VR is basically a VR breakout.I'll be blunt; I found the game boring after about ten minutes. I jumped right in and had no idea what I was doing; everything was moving really slow and it was actually a bit frustrating. I jumped back out and played through the tutorial and learned about the different weapon types and energy and all that jazz. Basically you can make your paddle bigger and shoot some boxes with different ammunition; nothing revolutionary, just a new take on 3D breakout in VR.The problem with this though, is even when I had 4+ balls in play, the game was just boring. The balls come at you slow, the 'hallway' in where the blocks are is very narrow and limited (I have a large room) which makes the balls bounce odd ways; this makes for awkward hits on the ball in awkward positions that are more frustrating then fun. They also come very slowly; I assume as the game speeds on they get quicker as they did in multiplayer, but I didn't even want to play that long to find out quite honestly.Which brings me to my next point, multiplayer. I played two games against he same opponent, and he was definitely already experienced in the game. That wasn't the problem though; because the space we were in/hallway we were hitting back and forth in was so small, he could reach pretty close to my field by walking ahead. This allowed him to put his hands right in front of the ball spawn and block the ball, hitting it quickly back towards him then towards me not allowing me to get the first swing or be ready for the hit. Not to mention the connection was laggy, so I assume it is client hosted which presented other problems in that my hits did not feel 1:1 with the ball and watching the opponent hit it was slightly off too. Another thing - when you walk outside of the specific area it wants you to stand in, the screen just goes black. That's disorienting and feels very lazy to me.The game looks good graphically, and unfortunately that is all I can see being really positive about it. I guess I was spoiled by Holoball, which is fast paced and uses all of my room and is an actual take on Pong in VR, but Cyberpong VR did not live up to what I thought it might be from the name and multiplayer features that I saw when it first caught me eye.

												I am writing this review in response to my gameplay today. The game needs work on reducing lag in MP games. Hit box adjustments with the rackets and the room-scale space. These types of games should have a rotation option for the room scale space so you can play in your maximum space. That is what all VR games should have and I urge everyone to start asking for this in VR games. We should not have to go to SteamVR and change our room scale from game to game. I am thumbing this game down until these issues are fixed. It simply is not worth the price for the lack of stuff and optimizations. Don't get me wrong single player may be fine for people that don't do MP but the MP is fun to do but is too laggy and lacking play modes. Plus finding people is not easy. I always take a friend with me so we can hook up on a private game.I am not sure if the devs addressed any isues mentioned above but I guess since there is really no other game out like this one it is worth a buy. Overall for the price it is worth it and a good workout. Video of A-10 VR and Cyberpong with my wife after it processes. Enjoy.

												I like this game a lot, both solo and multiplayer. Starts off slow then quickly gets hectic in solo. Some glitches now and then but overall well made and fun. Doesn't require as much running around as HoloBall which is good if you have a smaller playspace or don't feel like getting sweaty in your headset!			"

												I wanted to update my review on this game.  Originally I posted this as a negative review, but have now changed it to a positive review.  I left the original review below for any of you who may be experiencing the same issues I was.Long story short, the issue ended up being a mixture of hardware configuration issues.  The odd thing was that other games I played were fine, but this one seemed to bring those issues to the surface.  Even though the SteamVR Performance Test said that my system was more than ready, UserBenchmark correctly identified the issues that needed to be addressed.  Once I resolved these issues, Cyberpong VR worked flawlessly.This is a great game to have in your library.  It really takes Pong to a much higher level.  I love the neon graphics.  Now I just need to work on my stamina so that I can play for longer than 10 minutes at a time :-)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review:Appears to be filled with bugs!The Good:Great visuals for a Pong game.  This isn't the old Pong game from the 70s.  Between the virtual stage and the variety of in-game play, this one would actually keep me entertained....if I could get it to work properly.The Bad:I have about 20 VR titles, and I haven't had any issues with any of them, except this one.  With this one, the screen keeps flashing from a black screen to the game (every couple of seconds), making the game unplayable.  As for my hardware, I'm a Vive running a Asus STX Strix 1070 08G on a i5-6600 16GB Win10 platform.  You would think this would be more than enough hardware to throw at it, as none of my other apps seem to complain, so there must be an issue with Cyberpong VR.This game has potential to be one of my favorite apps, if I could get it to run as designed, but until those issues are addressed by the developer, it pains me to say that I'm going to have to give this two thumbs down.

												One of my favorite VR titles. I keep coming back to this one every time I fire up the Vive. It's great for 10 minutes of cardio here and there - I have fun and break a sweat playing this game and that's pretty rare for me. The theme is very fitting for VR and the music is pretty catchy too. I love that you dont have to smash the balls back, the physics remind me of arcade pong (not a realistic pingpong game - and thats a good thing). I highly reccomend Cyberpong!			"
