												Tokyo Drift? Initial D? VDrift? If anything of this appeals to you, this might too.In any case, this game's remarkable. It's challenging, exciting and unforgiving. But let me tell you, it's just as satisfying once you get a feel for it.You start out in a minimalistic world, sitting in the infamous Toyota Trueno AE86. Your destiny? Drift. A brief tutorial follows, which will probably result in you crashing into walls a lot, but that's fine, as nothing else really is needed to understand how this game works! The game then releases you into a free-roaming environment with a few missions you have to do to unlock more stages. You can then also select stages, cars and tracks once in Free-roam mode, a bit like in NFS or other racing titles.As you get more familiar with the controls, the stages get more exciting and challenging/longer. They also come in several formats: Lap-based drift-tracks, Driftkhana, which is a highscore time-attack inside an arena, or mountain sprint tracks. The goal is always the same, drift gracefully, score points, interact with objects such as poles to drift past or boxes to shatter, add that up to the final score and remain away from hitting walls or losing your combo. Sounds easier than it is, trust me, the Japanese themed tracks and names will kick into your curb at first.That said, car handling is the key, each car has their own way of handling, so finding what suits you most will be the way to go. Ontop of that, drifting's the deal, so going fast won't always be the key to success either. Manual or automatic shifting? How high should be the turning sensitivity? Well, all these factors will help you optimize your driving style, making it possible to reach up to be the drift king.I personally had, and will have a blast with this title in the future. It's been a while since I found an appealing drifting/racing experience and I can safely say this game has done it right. Now go... Go... and be the next Drift-King.			"

It's spinning drifting time! Pros:+ 6 different cars to drive+ Has achievements and trading cards+ Controller support, with smooth controls+ Fitting soundtracks to add to your ""Leet driving skillz"" + 3 game modes to play for leaderboard lovers with 24+ levels+ Free roam is interesting and fun, featuring themed levels, range of missions and good level designNeutral Points:> No multiplayer, which is a shame because I feel it would be fun> Difficulty, getting used to the drifting is not easy, can be frustrating when trying to get that high scoreCons:- Price tag is too high for what the game offers- Game is short, offering roughly 3 hours of content- No replayability, boring after you've completed it all- Controls are sensitive, spinning out or losing control is commonRandom totally (not) true notes: None of the cars have cup holders, blue shells from mario kart have a slight chance to appear from another dimension and mess you up, and drifting doesn't mean drift to sleep (I learned that the hard way and spilt my coffee)Download Size: 421mbTrading cards: 6 cards in the setAchievement Difficulty: Moderately difficultHours to 100%: 3+Rating: 7.5/10Recommendation: Grab it on a big sale for a couple hours of driving, sliding, crashing and attempted drifting. I'd recommend a controller too. Not worth the full price howeverMy opinion:Interesting and entertaining, it does what it sets out to do well. It is ok for one playthrough but is boring after, plenty to do if you like getting your name on the leaderboards but the drifting takes a good while and some practice to get good with. Difficult without practice but once you got the drifting down getting all the achievements are easy. Levels are nicely designed and the free roam is fun to play, the 3 other modes are somewhat fun but more for the competitive types trying to get the highest scores/times. For the full price tag of £8.99 it's not worth it in my opinion, best get it heavily discounted. I feel it would of been nice to have some multiplayer, maybe then it would be worth the price.			"

 PROS++ Great aesthetic with superb use of minimalistic design and an awesome sound track+ Drifting feels realistic and responsive, helped by the inclusion of both manual and automatic modes+Free Roam and tutorials teach you everything you need to know in order to work towards mastering the game CONS--No ghosts for event mode, something I consider absolutely essential in any game focusing on trials-Will be very difficult for those unfamiliar to the realistic racing genre way of drifting-No multiplayer, nor is there likely to be multiplayerAbsolute drift may not be for everyone, but those looking for a realistic drifting racer experience will enjoy this game immensely. All three modes in the game, Drift, Driftkhana, and Free-Roam teach you the skills required for drifting in addition to providing dozens of hours of replayability for those attempting to get the best scores possible. The game is incredibly challenging, and posting top scores to the leaderboards for the event mode levels will be reserved for only the best of the best as the skill ceiling for the game is incredible high.

												Let me try to describe how I feel about this game. In fact, let me swoon over it, let me drool all over my keyboard. This game feels absolutely perfect. Surely it is not a perfect game as there should/could be still some content added like maybe a simple map designing tool (with workshop support?). This game actually looks very simple, the surface is white and each of your tyres leaves skidmarks to see how smoothly each of your four wheels cleared a corner. Important things are coloured red. I am not cutting to the chase, but the feeling of ""Absolute Drift"" is just great. this game lets you peacefully control a car sliding around a menu-like open map with objectives to do and areas to unlock. There are special tracks for each gamemode which can be entered. The atmosphere is well-rounded with an electronic soundtrack, subtle tyre squealing and rich car sounds.I like to drive the car of my family in real life and I got experience with racing games like ""Live For Speed"", ""SHIFT 2 Unleashed"" or ""BeamNG.drive"". So before I tried this game I already had some drifting experience (using a steering wheel), which most likely helped me get into this game quickly.If you are not sure, whether you like the game mechanics, you can check for a demo on indieDB, though it is by far not as developed as the final game.So should you buy this game and support the developers? Definitely, yes!Well, given that you are into going sideways, but if you are looking at this, you probably are.			"

												Absolute Drift is a *gasp* drifting game. Of course the most important part of a vehicle game of any sort are the controls. I will admit that the controls in Absolute Drift are quite tight while the driving itself does feel a bit too slippery, but as you might guess it’s not a big deal in a game where your only goal is to slide stylishly. Absolute Drift also boasts a unique Japanified minimalist aesthetic, paying homage to one of the origins of the drifting motorsport. It isn’t all roses but let’s not hesitate to pop the hood and see what we got, this is Absolute Drift.Free Roam mode serves as the Story Mode, and will serve to introduce you to the controls as well as different challenges and events. After spinning out a few times and learning the art of counter-steering you will begin to grasp what the game is really all about and because there is very little hand-holding, conquering a world challenge or topping the global highscore for any track feels like a great accomplishment. Absolute Drift has a total of 23 tracks to enjoy; 10 circuit Drift tracks, 9 open-world Driftkhana courses, and 4 one-way Mountain Drift tracks, so you can find the event that suits you best.While the world challenges and events have as much variety as can be expected, I find that it still isn’t quite enough. Drift around this, drift between that, it isn’t until the last stage that things start getting really interesting. All I’m saying is I wanted to jump on a few more roofs. Car customization is limited to 6 body-types, which all have a slightly different feel. You can also pick a color and a decal, but nothing beyond that. I would really like a chance to fine-tune my engine and shocks. Stripped-down customization and lack of real-time damage are gigantic missed opportunities.I enjoyed my time with Absolute Drift, with its low-key dance music soundtrack, inoffensive looks, and high degree of mastery. Lack of customization and content hurts replayability, but the difficulty curve and global scoreboards means it still has quite a bit to offer. The story mode can be completed in around 2 hours, and if that’s all you’re buying this game for then $12 might be a bit overpriced. It is a bit of a one-trick pony, but it does that trick extremely well. If you’re in the mood for a score-attack drifting game, give Absolute Drift a try. Though it might be worth waiting for a sale. Big thanks to Funselektor Labs for the review copy! We at IGB hope to see more quite soon.Gameplay:    Controls- 8/10    Fun Factor- 4/10    Difficulty- 3/10    Replayability- 8/10    Innovation- 7/10Aesthetic:    Graphics- 7/10    Music- 9/10    Sound FX- 6/10    Story/Lore- 1/10    Level Design- 6/10Final Score: 59/100 for replayability, controls, and music.Summary: Minimalist drifting simulator with a large degree of difficulty, and a rocking soundtrack.Verdict: A bit of a one-trick pony, but it does that trick exceedingly well.

So, here it is. My review.At time of posting, I have all the achievements and have 50 hours in the game.First of all, just a general comment: I love this game. It has a great, smooth game engine and the controls are fairly easy to me. It wasn't too hard to pick up, and learning some drifiting from Assetto Corsa and driving my Miata IRL, I can say that the physics are very realistic and it's easy to apply those skills into this game.Here's a list for the TL:DR, and it's at the top (you're welcome):Pros:- Smooth Game Engine- Difficulty Settings are Spot On- Controls on Every Difficultly Setting are Great- Music is Great (Especially C41; sorry Nyte, your music is still great, lol)- Colors are Great- Online Leaderboards- Fairly wide selection of Maps- Driftkhana, Drift Tracks, and Mtn Drift settings are awesome to choose from- Game is Updated at a Good Pace- Game as a Whole was Tailored for a Wide audience- Wide Range of Adjustable Graphics Settings to Fit your Performance Needs- Different cars fit different people, but aren't too unbalanced in terms of full capabilites.- Free-Roam. Yesssssss...- Less than 500 MB (currently)- Very Fair and Rewarding Point system that pushes you to try harderCons:- Non-customizable Controls (Steam Controller's Reprogramming Defeats this Con)- No-multiplayer, yet (for reasons)Otherwise, this game is perfect in my opinion.Okay, now the novel:Personal CommentsI have owned this game since August 2015 and have really been off and on with it. I can tell you that once I got a Steam Controller, everything changed, and I loved how the game played with it. Honestly, I couldn't play it on anything but the highest difficulty. PhysicsThe physics are phenomenal. I don't think I have ever played such an arcad-ey styled game with such realistic physics. It totally replicates real life (or damn near it) and the developer did such a great job with it. From what I have seen, there are no current bugs in the game's physics and I see no reason for the physics to be modified at all.GraphicsThe graphics are great aswell. I think that the color theme is perfect for the (not so much) ""JDM/Dorifto"" and (but more) Japan feel. It is a little brutal on the eyes when you're in a dark room or are very tired, but otherwise, it is very fun and keeps you alert. I really enjoy how the tire marks work. They really help when you are drifitng if you need to see if you're angle is going too far (genenrally more than 90º), and they look cool. The graphics, in general, may seem a little bland at times, but it really keeps you focused on what you're doing. Plus, this game isn't really about looks, it's more about the gameplay.Gameplay/ControlsAny kind of controller (I use a Steam Controller) is nearly a must. Keyboard is simply not enough to fully enjoy and get good at this game, but it is still playable. It really sucks that you can't change the controls in game, but the Steam Remapping or something like motioninjoy could help with that. The actual controlling on all difficulties is great and accurate to their names. The hardest difficulty feels butter smooth and is what I use all the time. If you take your time, you can really learn the game and get good with a car that fits you. I personally work well with ""The Original,"" but who knows what you might be great with. Also, there is always a mixture of challenging yourself, the music, and the map you're on that can give you different moods within the game.This game is also very fun and easy to get back into and keep with. I think that in general, it may get boring after you completely master (rank 1) all of the maps and finish the campaign, but it would take a long time (probably no less than 150 hours) before you get to that point. At least for me, the game pushes me to try harder and be the best at any map I try. I am currently, as of this review, number 4 on Mt. Nikko with about 300,000 points to go to number 1. It's taken me about 15 hours to get to that point and I don't plan on stopping until I am at number 1.Last WordsThis game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I don't even think curse words can explain how awesome this game is. I think that the game has come a very long way in the past 9 months and I think that it has amazing potential. funselektorlabs deserves a lot of credit for the creation of this game. I can't wait to see how this game evolves because it would be a shame if it were to stop where it is. However, it wouldn't be horrible because the game is already amazing as-is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Points SystemThe point system is very fair and I think I have it figured out, in general. Here's my thoughts:- Depending on drifting direction, a sideways-sliding score is given, and it's when the most rear wheel in a drift (if you're going right, it's the rear right) is farther out than the forward wheel (if you're drifting around a right corner, it's your left front, and vice-versa):- This is the general ""drifitng score.""- The wider the angle up to a 90º drift is more points- You get a multiplier based upon how long you have been drifing ""continuously""- If you're going too slow, the points stop adding- If you go over 90º, the points stop adding- If you hit anything, except bonuses, your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier- If you stop drifing for too long (I think about 5 seconds), your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier- Extra points are given when you go around a bonus pole:- The closer you are, the more points you get- The faster you are going, the more points you get- If you're too far away or ""aren't drifitng"" near one, it doesn't count- If you hit one, it doesn't count, but doesn't get rid of your score or multiplier- Extra points are given when you hit a red block:- If you hit it you get points- If you don't hit it, you get no points- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points- Extra points are given when you go around a donut circle (driftkhana only):- If you finish the donut indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points- If you hit it, you get no points- Extra points are given when you spin in a ""spin-zone"" (driftkhana only):- If you finish the spinning indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points- There's really no downside to these...- Points are inceased exponentially (I don't know how much the curve is) if you stack bonuses in one ""continuous"" drift:- If you keep getting bonuses, they'll exponentially increase- If your current score is reset, so does your bonus stack			"

												Absolute Drift is one of the best drifting and car related games ever made. If not THE best.  The game is incredibly simple at face value, which lends to the game being both aesthetically and mechanically perfect. Its top down perspective and simple visuals work fantastic together. You get a broad view of your canvas, allowing you to cut amazing drifts and prepare where to go to create the best line. The cars to choose from (including a BMW, an AE-86, a Supra, all made as generic cars with nods to their real life counterparts) are incredible. Again- all this is due to its simplicity, and the simplicity was very goal driven by design. When you look at your car- it gives the same feelings you had with your Hotwheels as a kid, they all control as people expect them to (The AE-86 is so well balanced it's essentially all I use, just like the the real life Toyota is percieved to be) .... They perform as your tool to navigate the perfect drift, and at the same time they are the tip of your paint brush that is marking the canvas laid out before you- painting the world in black ink as you weave and arc your way around- the sound of your rev pinging and tires squeeling as you yank the E-Brake and swing back the other way is spot on. //Drifting as an art.That's the beauty of this game. It gets Drift culture better than any other video game before it. It doesn't slap you in the face with popular culture, icons, brands... It bleeds the emotion and style of Drifting, and that's it. The only real world reference beyond the cars themselves, are the Torii that dot the landscape, which are the gateways to the next chapter in free-roam... And the japanese chimes that play as you make your way to the next level. (Remember their use in this?

 ...Fantastic)  The Japanese imagery and use of a paint-brush on canvas visual style bleeds Drifting as an art form. A pure form of expression through controlling a car. It's respectful to the art, but mechanically this is incredible as well. //Pitch perfect Drifting mechanicsThe game will start you off and tell you how to drift- it puts you through a simple tutorial before letting you loose on this clean playground- a playground with real world objects... Ferris wheels that make me think of the pier in LA, train yards and other construction type objects that help me to imagine drifting in big open back lots late at night. It's all so clean and perfect that  much like reading a book, it allows you to fill in the blanks with your own perception of the craft. Just the way it should be. But again, the craft itself is just as important- and the tutorial gets you on the path and then drops you in to learn the rest yourself. The other major part of pure drift-culture is failure and success. Learning your car, learning physical limitations, tinkering with your setup (in this case the controls to match your comfort, turn sensitivity and ""difficulty"" which to me is more of a way that the car acts- try medium and hard as well, as you may find the car acts a bit more like it should in your mind) ... Failing and trying again until you learn how to drift and master a course. That's the thing about drifting and people who actually do it. It's a comradery thing- it's something you don't learn over night, it's not all about showing off and looking ""hella dope"" ... It's about mastering something with a deep learning curve and perfecting it. It's about risk and reward. For a top-down arcade style racer, this game allows you to do just that, while still BEING A VIDEO GAME and not a NASA-sponsored sim of the craft itself. I can't say this enough, aesthetically and mechanically this game NAILS the art and culture of drifting better than any game before it, and likely after it too.//Presentation is everythingAnd present it does. It is effortless here. No obnoxious menus to slog through. You can go back to the main menu from a course in free-roam nearly instantly, and the music doesn't change either. That's a BIG thing too. The music is perfect ambient EDM tracks. All majorly chill. They all fit and hit the modern car-culture perfectly and enhance your driving experience while doing it. The first track to start when I loaded up the game the first time was perfect- with an awesomely simple title splash that slides perfectly into the game as you hit Enter... The game feels perfectly put together. Every piece fits seamlessly... And as I swap to a different mode or back out and the music doesn't suddenly cut or change- that helps to make the package feel that much more ""whole"" and perfect.Simplicity here is key. The game doesn't use simplicity to hide faults it possibly could have if they added more- it uses it so that you notice and gravitate to the things you SHOULD while playing it. The mechanics and ink-brush style of your drift. It's zen. Absolute Drift is Zen. Fun to play for a couple minutes while waiting for your friends to get grouped for a dungeon in WoW or Competitive CS GO. Fun to play with your coffee while you wake up. Fun to just play for hours with no interest in doing anything else- just to top the leaderboards or channel your inner DK. Absolute Drift is just that- Absolute Drift.			"

""Buddha & drifts""This game is brillliant. As if micromachines is revived and some devs that have watched too much Fast & Furious 3:Tokyo Drift. The graphics are minimalistic like in Mirror's Edge. White surfaces and only the important objects are marked red. In each of the 5 total levels you have to complete little jobs like drift under tubes or jump on top of houses via ramps. Basic shops are spreaded over the map with paintshop service or car model exchange. I liked most ""the Super"" and ""das Whip"". You can also find all event race tracks during your playthrough. The jungle soundtrack is fast paced drum& bass or jungle music. Lateron I figured out you can even change your car from automatic to manuell gears and deactivate steering suppport. Which can be useful for pro players. What I've seen I can't believe my eyes. They perma-drift through all levels and gain much more than 10 mio points on it. I was lucky with my 2 Mio for the last achievement.			"

												I've had tears of joy playing this game to completion, which is a rarity, I will say.Absolute Drift is a top down, minimalistic stunt driving game. Your goal: become a master drifter, by refining the art of spinning out and smashing into walls controlling oversteer and burning rubber.For the aesthetics: it's low poly, simple graphics, with most buildings and roads left white and untextured. Objects of interest are coloured red, blue or yellow. Your car leaves behind skidmarks wherever it goes, whether you slide or not, which allows for impressive drawings on tarmac, or a nice spiral when you catch some big air.The soundtrack is a relaxing, upbeat electronic and DnB by Nyte and C41 respectively - which fits the near zen-like atmosphere of the game. Cars have simple, but distinct engine noises, with more subtle transmission whine or turbo flutter.The gameplay is the purest I've seen in modern driving games. It's you, your car, your skills and the track. Whether free-roaming, doing driftkhanas or mountain drifts, almost everything revolves around getting your back end slideways and very, very smokey. You have a selection of 6 cars to choose from, each performing differently from one another - some are heavier, some are more stable, some are more tail happy. All can be repainted and given a little livery. You'll spend most of your time smacking against walls drifting in an open-ended hub world, peppered with missions to perform - stuff like ""drift between this and this"" or ""donut around this"". Finishing the campaign takes around 1.5 hours, but you also have specific tracks - the aforementioned driftkhanas, mountain drifts and circuit drifts, containing Steam leaderboards that will push you to improve your scores.Let's not beat around the bush; the game is hard. The handling is intentionally challenging. Unless you're careful, it doesn't matter whether you use the gamepad or the keyboard, you WILL spin out and hit walls, and the game knows it. There are several difficulty settings to pick from, which change how grippy your car is, but above all, mastery of counter-steer, weight transfer, grip limit, torque and gearing is paramount to any decent drifting in this world. This results in one of the most satisfying moments I've ever experienced in videogames: the flow of stringing together perfect drifts through a tight and twisty track, losing as little momentum as possible and rocketing to the top. The execution of the handling is absolutely STELLAR.The game has finally been upgraded to the Zen Edition, bringing forth a new event type - Midnight Drifts, which are really really challenging! In addition, you have Event Challenges to unlock said Midnight Drifts, REPLAYS and GHOSTS on the tracks! This is the kind of free content that will exponentially boost the game's longevity, even if a level editor or proper multiplayer still don't quite exist yet. I'd liken this game as the Portal of driving games: a clean art style, a short campaign that doesn't overstay its welcome, if it's not over too quick, a dash of humour and one of the best (top down, minimalistic, very very slideways) driving experiences I've had in my long years of driving/racing games. I f-ing love it!Get it ASAP if you like/love cars, but even if you don't it's worth a try for the experience and the challenging but rewarding gameplay.			"

├Professors Review┤Overall Score95/100Game Pros • Clean and simple menu • Nice Drum & Bass and Electronic music by C41 and NYTE • Diversity in tracks (Becomes availble as you play through free roam) • Automatic/Manual transmission • Diversity in cars (Unlockable through free roam) • Challenging (You wont be a pro right from the start, takes time) • Leaderboards (Global/Friends filter) • Full controller support • Ghost cars and replays • 3 Game Modes: Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting with 24+ levelsGame Cons • No multiplayer (Drifting in tandem would be incredible) • The noise you get when you lose your combo is pretty loud compared to game audioRelateable Games  • N/A ConclusionAbsolute Drift is an incredible game. I've spent hours playing a single map trying to get the highest global score (Currently in the top 40 on the Oval track). When I dont feel like playing anything else, or im just in the mood to make some sick skids, this is the game I go to. Don't get discouraged if you crash a lot in the start, follow the tips and youll be a drift god in no time.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

Yeah this is hella fun! Although there is quite a learning curve, in my opinion - which I like. At first everything feels fairly 'icy', but ya just got take it easy with going full throttle and learning to over/under steer.Pros:+Beautiful minimalistic graphics+Easy to learn, hard to master+Cool meta levels, sorta reminds me a bit of Tony Hawk+I like how leaderboards give you statistics about what percentile you rank in compared to the public at large+Music is pretty awesomeCons:-Feels fairly icy, and requires some time to get used to (could be a 'Pro' depending on how you feel)-Some of the 'challenges' on the meta levels are kinda dumb and can be cheesed to achieveTotally worth it, IMO, if you like racing games.

""Absolute Drift"" Review *Disclaimer: This game was purchased for personal use, not provided by a developer. Absolute Drift, herein abbreviated as AD, is essentially a minimalistic casual driving game. You play from a 3D, third person “top-down” perspective, as you traverse 7 worlds completing various drifting tasks. The goal? Become a master drifter, sliding over water and doing donuts around Ferris Wheels. Here are a few things worth noting. Art Style The elegant contrast of white landscapes against bright red obstacles is the key idea behind the art style of AD. The graphics look gorgeous with their minimalistic textures and subtle physics. As you drive through stacks of blocks, you’ll be blown away at how the particles just seem to fall away without hesitation. The soundtrack is perfectly suited for the game, and huge props to the artists for their great work in that department. Difficulty The game seems simple at first – get your car sideways, countersteer, and you’re set. It’s not quite that easy. In free roam you will learn how to stay in drifts and exit the drift whenever you need to. Meanwhile, you can use various events to hone your skills on-track. There’s no difficulty toggle here – in events you are ranked against other players in global and friend-based rankings. Length, Story, Etc. One of the only gripes I had with this game was the length of the free roam world. There are seven “worlds” you go through before having to resort to replaying tracks over and over just to beat your own times. I would love to see a co-op or even online 1-on-1 game mode in this, and it would definitely give it a bit more reason to play beyond free-roam. Performance AD runs phenomenally on my rig, as I expected. However, as with all my reviews, I tested the game on Intel Integrated Graphics to see how well it would do for casual gamers. It ran at a solid 35 or so fps, definitely within a playable range. You could likely push it to 50 by playing 1280x720 windowed.Do I like this game? Absolutely. (Pardon the pun) I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game that they can complete with 100% achievements in less than 5 hours.

												I didn't know anything about Absolute Drift before buying it, but I knew I liked racing, drifting and that this game had a large portion of positive reviews. So I thought, ""why not?"". Here's what I think of this game after a few hours of play:Graphics: I've always been a huge fan of minimalist/subtle designs, and Absolute Drift pretty much nails that. Everything has a low polygon count. The track is white, the important things are red and the death zone (water) is blue. This very small color palette is great because you can very quickly understand any situation you are in, but it also carries a message that, I think, translates the game well: ""No BS, just drifting"".The black skidmarks felt kind of strange at first because they are here even when not drifting, but then I understood they were here to serve as a visualization of your driving, because they contrast the pure white track. By simply looking at the skidmarks, you can judge how well your took that last corner. More simply, it just looks nice.On a more technical aspect, at the time I am writing this, the game is very poor. The graphical options are very limited: no custom resolutions, no V-Sync and the graphical quality is limited to a few presets, which means you can't set the anti-aliasing, texture filtering, etc. on your own. Then again, the game launched very recently, so I have faith the developer will add those options later.Audio: The cars sound good, you can really feel how powerful they are when accelerating and the hissing sound of the tires when drifting is satisfying. The soundtrack blends in very well with the game. It's all electro music (like Drum & Bass), but all of the tracks are very calm. It was a good choice to make the soundtrack relaxing because the player will spend a lot of time failing and retrying, but the tranqulity of those tunes help remain calm.Gameplay: Here comes the most important part, and fortunately, it's the best. The control scheme is pretty much what you'd expect in any driving game: Left-Right-Accelerate-Brake-Handrake-Gear up-Gear down. Learning how the game works takes two minutes at worst, but knowing how to handle the cars themselves is a harder task. You cannot make a normal turn in this game, you will always slide. On top of that, the cars feel very heavy: even when you think you're going pretty slow, drifting will barely make you deccelerate and you will very often end up in a wall because of that at the beginning. When you get the hang of this, however, driving becomes a very smooth experience. You can easily chain multiple drifts and properly gauge acceleration/decceleration.The developper made the very interesting decision of only giving the player an isometric point of view instead of the good old 1st/3rd person cameras you can find in other racing games. It's quite useful because it allows the player to see further ahead than they normally could, and plan their drifts in consequence.Content: The game is split in two modes: Free-roam, where you drive in open spaces completing missions (which usually are ""drift near this"", ""donut around that"", etc.) to open new worlds where you complete more missions, and Events where you can choose to play on either Tracks (with 3 laps), Driftkhanas (small, open spaces where you must score as many points as possible in 2 minutes) and Mountain Drifts (tracks where you drift downhill to the end). There is, at the time of writing, 5 worlds and 24 tracks. The 5 worlds can be completed in about an hour or two and each world also unlocks various Events and one car.Something unfortunate is that all cars are, unless I have not played enough to realize the difference, model+sound swaps. It would have been nice to give all cars a different handling, but perhaps the dev will add this in the future.The good thing about Events is their replayability and the presence of a Leaderboards system. If you want to climb that ladder you will have to master every corner of every track, which is not an issue given how good the cars feel. The large amount of hours sinkable justifies, I believe, the price tag.One thing I would really love to see is the addition of a map maker (perhaps with Workshop integration) in order to enhance the lifespan of this game.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this little gem if you are the kind of person who likes spending a large amount of time on a single game in order to master it.

												I bought this game while it was on sale.  Me and my friend beat the game 100%.  It was mostly my friend though.Its a good game.  The game's sole focus is drifting.  Its not about upgrades and such, its all about drifting.  Theres no enemy AI to race against or anything like that.  Pros:fun gameplaylooks good in its own wayvery satisfying game to be good atyou can drive manualeasy with controller (I didnt play it with mouse and keyboard so I cant say how good it is with that setup)Cons:-Engine sounds could be a little better.  They sound kinda like cartoon versions of real engines and they're always freaking redlining.  It gets old.  -Not a lot of customization available for cars-not a whole lot of cars (like 7)-No NPCs.  (good and bad. nobody to bother you but also nobody to race or drift with)-Challenges can be very difficult.-Automatic transmission is garbage.  Im not saying that because Im a manual douchelord. No, I tried it.  I gave it a chance and theres no way you can drift with it.  You have to play manual.  IF you dont know how to play manual this could be a big negative.Overall, I got my money's worth out of this game.  Even if I would have payed full price I would have been satisfied.  It's worth a buy. "

												A simple concept beautifully exectued. Casual and relaxing but also competetive if you're in that mood. The minimalistic graphics and relaxing music creates a very likeable atmosphere (Mirror's Edge comes to mind). The controls are fluid and the physics surprisingly good, which makes the game challenging but also rewarding when you nail a run. There are some annoying bugs, but nothing major. The sound goes wonky sometimes but a restart of the event fixes it and for some reason the car is in reverse at the start of a race occasionally.""Story mode"" is very brief and contains tutorials for the different race modes and simple missions. Missions are repetitive (spin here, do donuts around that, drift through here) and you'll spend a lot of time driving around trying to find the last ones to unlock the next area. I wouldn't recommend this game for the price if you're just going to play through the free roam mode as the content just isn't there. But if you enjoy perfecting your skills there's a lot of replay value and leaderboards to climb. There are three modes: track, mountain pass and gymkhana and quite a few locations for each.Unfortunatley there seems like some cheating or exploiting exists as some high scores on certain tracks are outright impossible to achieve (I've seen scores ten times higher than second place) but unless you're able to score in the top 3 or so this won't affect you much.Still, overall a very enjoyable and well executed game. I hope to see more from the developer.			"

												Absolute Drift is butter on toast.. Smooth afDriving is similar to the early top down GTA games, in that the camera doesn't sit behind the car so steering becomes inverted at times. The cars themselves, handle as if fine tuned to float like sand bags on an ice rink.It's a little like the 'Skate' games in that you'll be finding areas of the free roam map and then sessioning that area, only instead of a curb or a rail it's a docking crane and a lamp post.The ""5 Worlds"" are pretty big, each with a couple dozen drifting challanges (tricks highlighted in red) that need to be completed for the bridge to the next zone to drop. Once all zones are connected they form a rather epic playground, diverse and beautifuly crafted. There is no loading between zones so free roam is exactly that.The ""Events""  are Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting (foremost being a timed freestyle session, the others being un-timed single/3 lap trials respectively). All masterfully crafted, resonating a 'hitman GO' kind of ambience.There are another two dozen of these, and I found everyone of them enjoyable.The Events, were rather challanging while the free roam challanges known as ""Missions"", were far too forgiving. You could half complete a spin twice and it would register as succesfull, for example.The Soundtrack is exceptional and worth the price of admission alone. I'm not being facetious, growing up in an era where albums sold for £15/$25 I would have happily dropped a tenner on this score. The music is perfect, sliding through a ceramic China town to C41 - On my way, everything just comes together. Worth noting that while the game isn't in a pre release state the devs are still actively pushing out content and patches, the creator has said this game was a labor of love, and it shows.9/10Could use more content and maybe a way to save and share footage. But what is there is a masterpiece in top down drifting and game design.			"

												Inspired by Ken Block’s Gymkhana series the best way to describe the game is the driving view point of micro machines, the score system of the trick sections in Project Gotham racing, the progression system of an N64 era platform game and a fantastic drift system that takes an age to master but always makes you feel it is your fault if you screw up.The game sees you progress through a number of worlds that act as the hub to complete missions. These range from performing stunts around obstacles to performing on tracks to gain points and get a world ranking.There are 3 types of events Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting but all are essentially a playground to gain as many points as possible. Controlled best with a gamepad the game takes about 5 minutes to understand, 10 minutes to become competent and even after several hours of game play I still did not feel I had truly mastered it.Visually the game is minimalistic but lovely to look at and run at a solid 60fps. The music soundtrack is also filled with tranquil base numbers.Now the game is not perfect. Relatively short I finished everything in a few hours and while trying to get higher up the league tables offers the game some replayability I feel that this will not be for everyone. I also felt that a more detailed tutorial to give tips on how to perfect drifting at the start as it took a lot of crashing into walls to really get the difference between how brake and handbrake acts.I enjoyed the game a lot and for the low price of £9.99 of your regional equivalent it is hard to not recommend but this isn’t a game which you will be playing for ages unless you really are a score attack gamer.Check out our video review here http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150731_game-tutor-grades-absolute-drift "

												Simple idea, done well. Pleasing physics and an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay style. Reminds of those old Micro Machines games on PS1.Remember how in GRID if you bump the wall you lost your entire combo? Not here. You just bank what you've accumulated so far but lose your multiplier.Mirror's edge color scheme is always nice, although the music isn't as atmospheric. Car sounds are suprisingly well made, with boost dumps every time you let off the gas, and the satisfying sound of the gears whining.Made it to World 2 in my pink hachi-roku and loving it so far, although £8.99 is quite steep.

												Probably the best drifting game on Steam right now, this little one man made indie will bring back the time where you thought you were good at Race Driver GRiD. Easy to learn, hard to master, a simple but very complete drifting game with a good variety of events (various race tracks, a free roam map, some Gymkhana) that will make you cry when you see the leaderboards after a ""great"" run.The mechanics and physics are very good and, even though I tend not to use them that much, a few cars with subtile control differences are also available with a couple of customisation. Nothing too fancy though, just a color swap and some very basic skins.The music is pretty good too, with interesting and quite fitted electro from artists Nyte and C41.If you like scoring based driving games with well done drifting mechanics, you're here for a treat.Well done Funselektor Labs Inc.

												GOTY 2015, without a doubt in my mind.Absolute Drift is the best driving game on PC, period. If you're like me, poor and without a 180SX of you're own, fire up Absolute Drift and get sideways to an absolutely stellar soundtrack! Absolute has a really simplistic ""indie"" art style with a very Mirrors Edge color scheme, that just works and looks beautiful! For me this game filled a hole for a drifting game after Rockstar ruined GTA5's driving mechanics and didn't allow for drifting of any kind.Pros:- Best soundtrack in an indie game since Minecraft- Best driving mechanics in any PC game EVER- Realistic and awesome vehicle sounds and crash sounds- Beautiful art style and color scheme- Global leaderboards make for endless replayability!- Good variety of vehicles, from a classic 180SX (missile) to the powerful WRX Wagon (hooniwagon)- 5 worlds full of fun ""missions"" as well as a helpful tutorialCons:- Only 5 worlds, even though they are all quite large, I would like to see more added. I would pay $10 for a DLC pack with 5 more worlds.- Scoring mechanics are kinda iffy, often destroying your built-up multiplyer even when you are constantly drifting or just because you barely tap a wall.9.5/10, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! For only CAD$12, how can you go wrong with a game like this?			"

												This is an excellent, laid back game about drifting through life with a chill soundtrack in the background and some really interesting physics-based gameplay in the foreground. Keep in mind that mastering control of your car through a drift is the primary gameplay loop here, so if you simply can't stand ice levels this is probably not the game for you. If you can get past that, though, there's a beautiful open-ish world (segmented off by challenges) with a wealth of things to drift around, through, in and over - as well as special levels that challenge you to drift through a course, or score as high as possible in an arena with a time limit. There's even a lighthouse named Donut!

At this point, the game's even taken its special anti-nausea edibles - so if you were put off by the camera in older Let's Plays (particularly during spins), give it another shot. One thing I would like to see is a bit more interactivity throughout the open world - sure, there's challenges you can accomplish and ramps you can jump off of and stacks of blocks you can knock down, but there's not much you can do to change the layout of the levels; it would be neat if you could (for instance) trigger a crane to raise a wall by doing a donut around a lever, or create a ramp by knocking over some of its supports. That sort of thing would be really cool, but it would just be an enhancement on an already great game.			"

Initially I bought this game to fill short amounts of time in between other games or to take on the go with me, but in the end I find myself playing this game more than any others in my library. PROS -Able to play for short or long amounts of time without feeling repetitive-Steep learning curve, but ridiculously fun once you get a hold of it-Options for manual and automatic transmission -Simplistic, yet beautiful art style-Easy to run on the most potato of computers (I can run it on my 1.7 ghz travel laptop for reference)-Decent soundtrack but amazing to turn off the music and jam to anything you want CONS -Terrible keyboard controls, in my opinion, so I recommend a controller-Needs a little more customization-Pricey at 12$ but if you have money burning a hole in your wallet, just buy it-NO EUROBEAT seriously like wtfIn conclusion, a must have for the Racing (or any other, for that matter) demographic			"

												""Full grown man playing with hotwheels on the kitchen floor: the game""I mean this as an enormous compliment. I'm only a couple hours deep, but this game really wears its heart on its sleeve. If you've ever played any top-down racers or classic grand theft auto, you'll understand the controls immediately, and they feel good.Now, the point of this game is stressed explicitly several times, it's not about speed. It's about control. Your performance is scored by how well you can control your drift down a straight away and through turns. The concepts and controls are very simple, and the early levels are very welcoming to new players. That being said, the skill ceiling is actually quite high. This is definitely a game of skill. If challenge doesn't interest you, or if you've been beating your head againt the wall on a difficult course, there is a free mode that lets you loose in a sandbox with ramps and obstacles to play with. This is the section that I liken to playing with hot wheels on the kitchen floor (it's exactly as fun as it sounds).I would say this game definitely has an appeal to people that enjoy high-skill game play that has a rapid loop of retrying until you get it perfect (ex: Trials, Hotline Miami, OlliOlli, Dark Souls)I just compared playing with Hot Wheels cars on the kitchen floor to Dark Souls.....

												Drift and crash a lot No, not the game, I mean you. Absolute Drift is a game all about Drifting in a minimalist 3D world.If you like your drifting, then this is absolutely for you... (assuming you can get used to the controls first.)If your the racer type and don't really like tight corners... Then stay away from this game, it's probably not what your after then.Zen Edition adds in some additional content such as more challengers and drift stages to conquer! You will have to ofcourse wait until the official release for Zen Edition before you see any of that though... But there is loads of other stuff you can do before that time so get yourself stuck into it and get have fun!Your always stuck in the one birds eye view angle point of view so you will need to get used to that pretty quickly as well. With a little practice, you'll be soon hitting the leader boards in no time. Have fun with this one ;) Now drift your heart out, because your gonna crash, whether you like it or not! XPI would recommend you get this game on a SALE. I got this as a gift from a friend, so it was worth the look at and I enjoyed it for the most part.My score: 8.5/10 "

												Nice game, with good minimalist graphics. Finished in less than 2 hrs, the rest was farming cards (thanks Idle Master!).EDIT (Aug 16th) - After the Zen Edition update, challenges were added to the events which will extend the playtime beyond the initial 2hrs of the Free Roam mode.			"

												Absolute Drift is an interesting top down car game, that focuses much more on drifting and the control of the car, rather than racing. You'll be doing your best to drift around corners, doing donuts, and fish tails in order to score as much points and to accomplish as much tasks as possible.

			Absolute Drift: Impressions (Drift driving adventure game, indie, gameplay, and review) Absolute Drift is an interesting top down driving indie game, that focuses on drifting more than racing.		

Once in the game you'll be thrown into a somewhat open world where you'll be doing various tasks, such as ramp jumping, donuts, fish tails, and other drifting and driving challenges. Once the section of the map's tasks are complete, it'll open up new areas of the game. While exploring this semi-open world, you'll also be given the opportunity to enter one of it's many mini-missions where you'll be aiming for high scores on the leader board. The game also features multiple car models, and colour and pattern customization as well.The biggest hurdle to Absolute Drift is it's learning curve. It's not an easy game to master and make little concession to beginning or even intermediate players. The controls are difficult at first, as the car feel very differnt from other driving games, and the ground feels something like ice. Spinning out and losing control of your car will probably be your first 30 minutes or more of your experiance. This might prove frustrating to players who don't play a lot of driving games (like me) but when you start to get the hang of things, and the small amounts of progress that you make in your driving ability really does feel rewarding. How ever, if you are a fan of driving games, it's focus on high teir play may very well be an attraction to you. The game also looks great, as it's polished and clean look catches the eye, with it's minimalist design, with great music that suit the game's look and feel. Infact, the game's OST was one of the main motavators to push through the initial frustration of the controls. I just wanted to keep playing so I could keep listening to the amazing sound track.Overall, Absolute Drift is an interesting car game that I mostly enjoyed. I loved the presentation, I love the music, I love the concept. The only thing holding me back from enjoying the game to it's full potential is my sucky driving in combination with the game's extremly high learning curve.Pros- Great visuals- Amazing sound track- An interesting concept- High teir driving fans would probably love the challenge levelCons- Extremely high learning curve- Frustrating at times			"

												Before we begin, let me first clarify my play time. At most I could say I got about 15 minutes of amusement before I became dreadfully bored. In the end, I was obsessed with completing a perfect game. Additionally my desire for achievement hunting came only after a 3hr idle for cards.**EDIT**Just happened to notice that I no longer have a perfect game thanks to an update...Luckily enough time has passed that I feel no urge what so ever to return and reclaim my perfect game. Further proof this game as little to offer. And before you post - Yes! I am a little salty because they stole my perfect game >.< **END EDIT**I'll condense the rest of my review to just the cons as you can read positive review for the pros.Problems:Aside from the repetitive ""challenges"" the game has no real focus other than drifting and comparing you score to other players. I guess that wouldn't be such a bad thing, especially if that is all you want, but for me I like interactive game play that goes further than a global score board.Lastly I want to say that I am not a fan of the drift mechanics. Now I am not saying I am any form of an expert on how drifting truly works, but I can state that for some reason I didn't find the drifting in this game fun. They're O.K. - just not for me. It felt like I had to learn a whole new set of drifting rules for a game I am never going to play again.Provisos:I would change my recommendation for the following type of gamer/situation;Perfectionist - Achievements were easy to get. (EDIT: Recent change/update stole my Completion)HUGE fan of any form of drifting - Drifting is in the title after all.Fan of Indie Games - For an indie game, it is not that bad.Massive sale - Anything $3 or under.

												This game is a masterpiece.Takes a bit of getting used to...Try Manual Transmission... First Couple Drift Tracks can be done on 3~4 gear...+Controls are smooth, almost perfect (with controller).        However, from what I hear, there'll be some slight changes soon, nothing too drastic. (Unity 5 PhysX)+Game has you ""preview"" new mechanics you'll have to learn to continue in the game.+Attention to detail        The developer put a ton of effort into pretty much everything and is still tweaking the game.Not the fast-paced or realistic type of racing... It's that Minimal Initial-D/Ridge Racer in-between that you can enjoy.Just try it and don't expect to pull off cool drifts at first...It's an art. You have to perfect your craft first.tl;dr versionYou can't drift like you've been chugging sake yet. Keep it slow and enjoy.			"

												This game features 3 level types: A-to-B mountain tracks, freestyle drift courses, and 3-lap race tracks. The free roam map has additional missions you can perform only once, such as donut around a light pole, drift between buildings, jump over a river, etc.I was pretty terrible with the drift controls for most of the game, but finally seemed to start figuring it out near the end. (The controls work just fine; I am just not very good at drifting.) Despite repeatedly crashing into walls, I really enjoyed playing this game. I enjoyed the game even more once I finally figured out how to drive and drift. I particularly loved driving around the map in free roam and discovering new missions to complete. The minimalistic art style and varied environments provides for a beautiful game that keeps you coming back for more.Pros+ Beautiful minimalistic art style+ Many missions to complete+ Large soundtrack with ability to skip tracks whenever you want+ Ramps! Launch your car into the air and spin out of control+ Customizable car body and paint jobs+ Controller supportCons- Not much replayability once you've completed all free-roam missions- Difficult learning curve for controls- Only three types of levels gives feeling of repeating the same thing over and overThe game trailer video perfectly shows a taste of what you'll experience playing this game. If the video makes you even remotely interested, then buy it!			"

+ A great minimalistic style that looks very pleasing to the eye+ Fantastic soundtrack with the ability to skip tracks whenever you like+ Free-roaming drifting challenges, with a few high flying ramps+ The gameplay is pretty fun especially when you get good enough to make long drifts without spinning out- The controls hold this game back a bit. It's actually deceptively difficult to learn how to make good drifts without spinning out or losing control. I feel like this is mainly because the steering is so limited, yet while drifting it's incredibly easy to spin out. This can be irritating, especially for new players.- All in all, the game feels a bit repetitive as you mainly repeat score attack challenges or do a variety of little challenges like drifting between objects or jumping off a few ramps.- Feels a bit unrewarding as you progress through the game. I mean there's no real goal or sense of victory while doing any of the challenges. The drift tracks are focused on competing on the leaderboards but there's no score goal to advance, so it really doesn't matter how well you do.			"

Absolute DriftAbsolute Drift is one of them 'small' games that you can have some enjoyment with, especially if you love drifting.What Do You Do?Basically, all you do is complete objectives and drive left and right, forward and backwards and so on while drifting This game alone isn't badly priced, nor high demanding for your PC, so that's also a positive note!For a small game with not too bad detail, I'll give it a solid 8.7/10			"

												This is one of the games where you can have fun, just drift around and listen to perfectly fitting soundtracks. If you're going to for challenges and achievements, though, prepare yourself to lots of despair and maybe even anger. Once you find the ""eureka"" moment of how to accelerate and steer without spinning out and/or (mostly and) crashing into walls, you'll find another difficult task how to balance these two into one beautiful long drift you've been waiting for.I was originally playing with keyboard, but when finally arrived my Steam Controller, I switched without any hesitation. I must say, playing with controller is a whole new perception of the game. And this comes from a person who never played with controller before.Game itself is minimalistic, easy to play and hard to master. There's also a set of soundtracks which didn't get repetitive even after nearly 10 hours of gameplay.I got this game on HumbleBundle during some sale, but I wouldn't hesitate and buy it for the full price. If you like this kind of games, you won't be disappointed.9/10 would even slightly touch the wall and lose score multiplier again.			"

In a nutshell - astounding game!

It's about:drifting;meditating.
Why you should play this:brilliant realization of drifting, you really feel for it;precise and responsive controls (on gamepad) - driving literaly on tips of your fingers;excellent soundtrack;two different game modes: Free-Roam, where you mainly unlock tracks for Event mode, and Event mode with challenges, where true fun begins;challenges sometimes difficult, but managable after some training.
Why you may not like it:it's ruthless to your fingers - may feel some pain after few hours session.
Speed, chattering brakes, smoking tyres, rhythmic music, car drifting on the edge... Zen.

												Absolute Drift is by far one of the most enjoyable driving games I have played so far.Difficult yet smooth game mechanics combined with a simple, elegant esthetic have created quiet the addicting combination.  Your in-game score earns you a percentile rank grouping, yet you can't see who's higher or lower than you.  This really helps you to set personal goals without stress, and takes the player back to the roots of ""improving is a reward in of itself.""Although I myself have not drifted a car in real life, I have had several friends tell me this game really represents actual, real life drifting mechanics pretty accurately.  Relaxing, difficult, beautiful, fun - plus, the soundtrack is great.  Good for zen gameplay and hardcore fun at the same time. 10/10P.S. the steam gameplay video actually represents the gameplay, unlike most game video previews.  You don't have to go all the way to youtube for in-game footage!P.P.S. You don't need a controller to play this! Mouse and keyboard works best!			"

Overall I really enjoyed my short stay, but thats the major problem.  The game contains a sweet 3 hour soundtrack, however in my quest to become a drift master and 100% this game, I failed to hear it all.3 hours for 12$ may not be your thing, but if you dont mind the price I'd recommend it.

												The music in the trailer was the tipping point for me buying this game.  The drifting portion of racing games is always my favorite (Grid, Forza, etc.) so this seemed like a good choice... and it was.After about  22.4 minutes of wall smashing, spinning out and generally being terrible... something snapped, i got in ""the zone"" the music was perfect, my drifts were (top 20% as the game put it) and I completed my first lap without crashing, and damn it felt good.Pros: Great minimalist style, Awesome soundtrack, A free-roam mode with quests in case you don't want to JUST browse tracks, challenging but learnable drift physics, getting into the ""zone""Cons: Maybe not tons of content for $12, but in this day age people spend more for less and less for more, so it's subjective.

			My review of ""Absolute Drift: Zen Edition"", an arcade driving game developed and published by Funselektor Labs Inc. Copy supplied by developer.		

Game: Absolute Drift: Zen EditionGenre: Arcade DrivingDeveloper: Funselektor Labs Inc. Publisher: Funselektor Labs Inc. Copy supplied by developerAbsolute Drift: Zen Edition is an arcade driving game developed and published by Funselektor Labs Inc. GRAPHICSThe game uses an isometric camera, giving it an instant old-school feel. The use of white and red in the maps helps you relax, while also highlighting challenges and important items.GAMEPLAYThe game is all about one thing: drifting. After having played some tutorials that help you understand the controls, you can play either Free Roam (where there are challenges to complete and objects to collect) or Events (which are maps where you have to complete certain tasks, like drifting for over 10 seconds or spinning into a circle for 3 seconds).The controls are deceptively easy, but the more you play the more you understand how deep and sensitive they are. Mastering the art of drifting sure ain't easy. So, I think that playing with a controller is mandatory, because when I tried playing with the keyboard it was almost impossible to complete even a single task.CHALLENGEThe Free Roam mode is very fun and relaxing, while the Events are damn hard and challenging (especially if you still can't drift that well), but thankfully only a couple of tracks were really frustrating.SOUNDThe soundtrack by C41 and Nyte is incredibly relaxing, and listening to it while exploring playing Free Roam immerses you into the driving quite a lot. And, for once, the sound effects of the car aren't annoying.REPLAYABILITYEven though the game itself will take you around three hours to complete, you can unlock new cars and paint jobs, and you can try improving your high-scores and completing all the tasks.Overall, if you are a fan of driving games but don't want the pressure of actually taking part in races, definitely play Absolute Drift: Zen Edition: it is relaxing and it has some of the deepest drifting mechanics I have played.Story: n/a

It's about driving a car with like grease on the tires and you have to slide around literally every corner and jump through a bunch of little hoops to try to score points. It's simple, polished and about as pure as a game gets but in spite of the claim in the title that it's a zen game, it is super frustrating.The first hour of this game was just me going ""jesus christ how the hell can anyone be good at this."" then i kind of learned that i had to throw all my natural impulses in racing games out the window, drive a little slower, and then I still ♥♥♥♥ed up about a million times. The first actual track in the game is just a standard oval but it honestly took me nearly 45 minutes to get a relatively reasonable score and complete 4/5 track objectives. And maybe the fact that it requires you to reassess your assumptions about something and respond to it more instinctually means it is a little more zen than a lot of things that claim to be zen.Maybe my biggest beef is the music and some of the sound effects are at least a little obnoxious, but it's a pretty legit good game. I may actually keep it installed and play around with it. Recommend at a discount or in a bundle, but only if you look at the trailers and think it looks fun. Also that ♥♥♥♥ in the trailer? you won't be doing that right away. Kind of makes me think of the earlier iterations of the Trials series in a lot of ways, if that means anything to anybody.			"

												In Absolute Drift you drive a little car trying to get as high as possible score by sliding your car aka drifting and spinning. It is a single player game but you can compete with your friends by a ranking system - after each driven event you see your rank depending on your best score from drifting. You can drive a free roam also. In free roam you are driving on map divided in different but connected worlds with amount of missions. If you complete all missions including drifting, spinning and jumping, following world is unlocked and you may drive in. Or you can just drift freely in the map.You may change color of your car, use keyboard/xbox/ps controllers, choose manual or automatic transmission, steer assist on/off, steering sensitivity and vibration for your controller. Could be nice with wheel support too.The game has nice simple and clean graphic and gameplay is very smooth. It could have profiles for different people playing on a single computer or just playing it again and again, because if you complete a mission in free roam, looks like you cannot reset your game progress to be able to play it again. This is about missions in free roam not about events which you can repeat indefinitely.			"

												 The simplistic art style of this game serves it well. The driving and drifting both feel great. I prefer using a Controller, but the keyboard is still set up nicely.The game has an Isometric view, and personally I believe its unique for a vehicle based game.This Isometric view is well done, and your car always stands out from the objects in the game.The games physics make you really feel like you're drifting.It's has a slight learning curve, but you can really improve quickly.They have tons of levels, training levels, and free roam type mode.There are some moments that feel less real ( arcade like ) , but its all fun.There are a few bugs here and there when it comes to the point system, but overall the game is a blast.If you like vehicle games, drifting games, etc.. This game is definitely for you.Its a damn good indie game.I give Absolute Drift an 8/10 "

												Drifting is the name of the game here and that's precisely what you're gonna get. Drift around that pole! Sweet!Now jump over that lake! Awesome!Get them donuts going on that helipad! Cool!That's basically it. There's a free-roam mode which consists of several zones with mini-objectives as well as separate events scattered around. Get to the zone, complete objectives, unlock the next one - repeat until you're the drift master. Events are instances in which you can rack up your personal score and compete with other players via the leaderboards. You have 3 lap drift courses of varying difficulty, driftkhanas, which essentially are closed off arenas in which you race against time to get the highest score possible and you have drift tracks in which you go from point A to point B and get as many points as you can along the way. The game is short, if you're aiming to 'complete' it. If you're here for the pleasure of drifting though, you can spend hours upon hours perfecting your skills. The presentation is fantastic with very slick, clean and, most importantly, clear visuals. Music is very catchy and complements the picture in the best possible way. All in all - if you like stylish visuals, racing and drifting, treat yourself with this little gem.			"

												This game must be one of the hidden gems around these parts. I loved the Drift ""Races"" in the NFS Underground games, which is why I decided to check this game out and I actually got all the achievements without too much trouble. The physics of drifting are very well executed and the soundtrack gives the game a really nice atmosphere. It doesn't have that much content, but definitely has replay value, if you enjoy the art of drifting.If you want a challenge, you can always try getting 5 million points, which is what the Insane Skills achievement was in the past. Or try getting top 5% on all tracks, it's up to you.			"

												ZEN EDITION UPDATE: I gave another try to Absolute Drift after the Zen Edition update this week. Being able to play it with the controller definitely makes it less bad to play. However, I don't feel the drive model has been changed. It still needs improvements in my opinion to be enjoyable.Using analog controls definitely does the difference. But it's still a real pain to just enjoy the game drifting. I know the game is more focused towards highscorers and achieving perfection through repetition, but my expectations were that I would be able to just drift smoothly easily, even if not in an efficient way. Or at least doing it in the easy mode.After the 2 hours I've spent on the update, it turns out I had a way better time in hard mode than in easy mode. I still had to be fully attentive to not mess up, as hitting a wall always breaks the rythm of the track, as well as ending up in a spin. Recovering from a spin is a hassle, you can't quickly go reverse-turn-forward using the car's inertia (and same for the other way around).Regarding controls, having multiple layout for controllers is better, but still, none of them suited me. I would have prefered to have the option to set the handbrake as LT. I personally can't handle acceleration + handbrake with the same hand. So I ended up only using acceleration and rarely brake/reverse. And you still can't change the settings while racing or free-roaming. And you can't reset the settings either.So eventhough this update has brought improvements to the game, it hasn't done so for it's core gameplay. I've personally enjoyed it a bit more, but I would still not recommend it unless you are a highscrorer, love repeting something unnecessarily hard to master and cramped hands after 1-2h of gameplay.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL VERSION:I started playing that game because I heard some good about it, feeled like my jam and I had it in an humble bundle. Once I started the game and started playing it in free roam, I really wanted to like it. The art style is good, the music is great and I like the concept. But after a few tracks and missions I realized the drive model wasn't up to par with the rest of the game. I played the whole game in easy. I tried different sensitivity settings but not much because it's really a hassle to change it: you have to EXIT TO MENU to go to settings, you can't even change it while playing!! I also had to play with keyboard because of the problem with my Xbox One controller. I went to the forum topic in the community hub and followed the different tips to make it work but none of it did the trick. It's the first time I see a game do that bad with a standard controller.I forced myself to go through the 5 worlds in free roam to try and get better. I did a bit, especially with The Missile and Das Whip, which are way easier to control than the previous cars in my opinion. I also felt quite good playing the mountain drift tracks, which only appear starting with world 4! And after getting to world 3 I stopped doing the driftkhana tracks which were just pointless and not enjoyable at all to me.Wanted to like it, loved the looks, loved the sounds, hated the driving model which is the key part in this game ><. I was so tensed during the game to not mess up my driving that my arm now hurts after only 1.5h of continuous play. So if you like to master broken games, go for it. If you don't, go look for another one.			"

												Absolute Drift is not a standard racing game, it's heavily focused on the handling mechanics of a drift car with a quite steep learning curve. Previous experience with racing titles and real life knowledge of how drifting should work will definitively help to get over the first approach to the controls.Don't even bother using a keyboard, this game is best played with a controller that has analog input for the throttle control, a xbox 360 controller is just fine. In addition, I strongly suggest to try the manual transmission and disabling the assisted steering in order to have more direct control to the car.Thematically the game is full of reference from the iconic ""Initial D"" manga to the Japanese drifting car culture in general. Overall the game aesthetic is minimalistic and beautiful with an awesome soundtrack to complete the well polished package. The only complain I have is the ""white buildings on white roads"" which can cause confusion, but admittedly I'm playing on an awful monitor so your experience may vary. I strongly suggest this title to every car enthusiast. Just the turbo whistle when you lift of is enough to justify the purchase. This game also teaches you how to quickly deliver tofu on top of a mountain. (untrue)			"

												Game itself is refreshing. From the beginning you can find it a bit challenging to control if you are using keyboard but it's still not something that difficult to figure out. Game does not force you into anything so you can go through it by your own pace. TL;DR + mad skids+ soundtrack+ handling+ variety of tracks - circuits / mountain passes / gymkhana styled maps+ Variety of cars and liveries10/10 would make tofu delivery runs with ae86 ^^With addiction of challenges you have more stuff to do.

												Really cool minimalistic drifting game. Has fantastic atmosphere, the enviroments manage to capture japan really well and the music is fantastic. The engine noises are accurate, all the cars (though they are not named as such) are real life cars and have preformance to match. Some of the cars featured include an AE86, Nissan 240sx, and a Supra. You can tell drifters made this for drifters. Keyboard controls are really well tuned work surprisingly well. Very rewarding to master. Good sense of humor to top it off. All its missing is tandeming witch might get patched in.....9/10			"

My first time playing this game (well, maybe my first hour) was me being really frustrated at not being able to drift, not being able to control my car, and generally not being able to make it the way I wanted. I pictured a game that was more about relaxing and leisurely drifting through tracks or endless highways, but was wrong.The thing is, I don't mind being wrong; Absolute Drift has a great mechanics system that rewards you for putting time in and learning how your car works. This is likely as close to it comes to the real world, too, as no one is necessarily a Drift King the first time they try. The more time I spent tweaking the settings (note: you may find Hard controls with 100% steering sensitivity better if you're used to drifting in other Arcade-y racers) the more I felt myself gradually getting better.The cool thing is, every time I boot the game up now I genuinely need to warm up, as my first ten minutes are me reacclimating to how my car controls. This isn't a bad thing at all; again, it rewards patience and persistence, and the first time you actually do pull off something awesome (be it a chain drift, or even a drift that's challenging things a little too far) you feel amazing.Essentially this game rewards mastery of the mechanics and the time it takes to learn them. My main complaints are that I could do without the time limits, objectives and feedback during some event courses: I would love to be able to turn it off and just practice drifting (or just doing it therapeutically) without the game telling me I'm dropping combos or running out of time.I also think this game (especially when it's called a Zen Edition) could use some procedurally-generated endless highway that either has a difficulty you specify or one that changes organically; I LOVE the mountain and midnight courses in this game, but find them woefully too short.Great game, but you need to be patient with it. If you do, you'll find awesome, rewarding moments.			"

												This is one of the best games ever, haven't played something like that for a loooong time. I hate games with top camera, but this is something different, something you need to try. Not the easiest game I must stay, but still a lots of good drifts can be made. Also shame the ""career"" is so short.Anyway, I'd rate this game as high as possible, glad to spent money on it ;)			"

												Really cool minimalistic drifting game. Has fantastic atmosphere, the enviroments manage to capture japan really well and the music is fantastic. The engine noises are accurate, all the cars (though they are not named as such) are real life cars and have preformance to match. Some of the cars featured include an AE86, Nissan 240sx, and a Supra. You can tell drifters made this for drifters. Keyboard controls are really well tuned work surprisingly well. Very rewarding to master. Good sense of humor to top it off. All its missing is tandeming witch might get patched in.....9/10			"

												Despite the nicely done OST, this game run's better when some kind of eurobeat from Initial D is playing, specially when using the AE86 in the tougue delivering tofu at night.Aside from the classic meme, the variety of cars is nicely choosen, from the Corolla AE86 to the BMW M3 E30, passing by the classic 2JZ Supra and the (S13) 240SX, and later on with a Mercedes 300 TD based on the ""Black Smoke Drift Team"" missile.Very enjoyable if you like drifiting and minimalistic indie games, i'll give it a solid 8,5/10.Don't forget to put the eurobeat in the background after enjoying the (amazing) original soundtrack, hehe			"

												A decent casual game that can be played as such or competitively on the leaderboards, after getting within the top 100 on all tracks that aren't midnight tracks I can say that trying to improve your score to get even just one place higher than before is really enjoyable.Trying to get in the Top 8 to get onto the front page of the leaderboards is also fun as even if you do get the highest score somebody will more than likely come along and beat it allowing you to go back and take your title back.10/10 game, paid £3.59 for this game on sale, would have happily paid the £8.99 that it currently is asking for.

												A fun game. A bit too short in my opinion, I completed 100% in just 3 hours, but I enjoyed all the time I spent playing it. And despite having 100% completed, the event score leaderboards can keep you busy for a long time if you want to try and do your best.I like the simplistic looks of it, quite similar to Mirror's Edge. Car behaviour varies per car, and once you get the hand of it it's very satisfying.			"

												Got this game as a gift and it looks awesome and plays awesome... for about 30 seconds... then when i crash and reset the car, or restart the level, the car acts as if the brakes are perminantly on for the keyboard and the car wont even move or rev for my xbox360 controller. The game obviously recognises the imputs as i can navigate the menus just fine. Not sure if it's a bug or my computer or what but it's pretty unplayable right now. I'm sure this is an awesome game but i can't recommend something that I can't play.EDIT: Prematurely posted this review. On one of the discussions reguarding bugs and controllers I found that someone had a similar problem caused by their steering wheel being plugged in while playing the game. Unplugged my wheel and BOOM fixed. Great game and having alot of fun with it so far! Definately recommend now!			"

												As someone who's used to long hours of forza with all assist turned off, manual with clutch, and 1100Hp death rockets i was hoping i'd be able to feather the throttle and go pro mode on this game. alas, it's more of a mash the gas- don't gentle rub the break in an oversteer  or you'll come to a complete stop arcady type of racer. which isn't the worst thing. A) I'm sure they didn't have turn 10 money to call in goodyear and create some nasa grade handling system and B) I'm sure it makes the game more approachable for beginners. I personally found it hard to spin out and lose control cataclysmically like i often do in sim racing games, so it is quite forgiving.The challenges in the game are also quite forgiving. you can basically bash the walls on every object you need to drift under or next to and it gives it to you, which is awesome. it's a zenful game. it's something you play to mellow out and clear your head. and if it forced me to do something perfect before i could move on that would destory the balance, and I would break stuff and never play it again :)TLDR It's a peaceful, fresh, low spec zen game that is neither bad nor life changing. But for $1 on humble bundle, plus trading cards I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm sure the next time i catch a cold and im drowning in a sea of nyquil this will be one of my go to games while i feel like garbage. you can never have enough of those.			"

												Great game! At first it was annoying and hard to maintain the control of the drift, but over time in the actual tracks, if you continue trying over and over again, you will start to nail every turn, and get used to the mechanics of the drift.I started off with ZERO skill, but after playing for an hour on one level (yes it was that addicting, AND The music was GREAT) I managed to get top1% (95th) on one of the first tracks!9.5/10 Amazing game, would recommend.What I didn't like is that in Free Roam, it's still difficult to control the car, especially on a spinout, and hard to see the car itself when you're doing drifts sometimes.

												There's nothing quite like high score sideways action, but I never thought I'd love it from top down iso so much. If you like ""sim"" drifting at all, you'll love this game. The mechanics are top notch, reward skill, punish beginners. There's a slight lack of content, but if you're at all competitive, you'll be spending hours trying to hit high scores. Otherwise, if you get a few hours out of it, it still works out cheaper than a movie. The free roam could potentially provide hours of fun inventing lines and runs, but sadly there's no score system so the competitive side of me runs back to try hit some top 8's.			"

												Fun little game that is surprisingly hard to master.Though 100%'ing the game and achievements can be done in a single sitting, the quick climb to becoming a ""drift master"" is a good challenge. Cars are loose and easy to drift but hard to control. But controllable they are! This results in it feeling quite satisfying when you string together some tricks and turns and get your combo score flying high. But it can be quite frustrating when, more often than not, you don't keep control. The art and music combo is almost hypnotizing as you get mesmerized. But losing control and crashing your vehicle keeps you grounded in reality.It really could have used a bit more depth. Overall suffers from that feeling of input lag just by it's style of driving. But this bogged feeling, whether my imagination or not, extends to the menus as well. Things could've been more crisp in that respect. And it is quite short. 2.3hrs to 100% for me. Not even enough time to ""farm"" all the Steam Cards. I don't feel the need to beat my scores so I don't really see any replayability here. It could've used some sort of racing mode with NPCs or local versus. Would've been a great callback to a MicroMachines or OffRoad feel. Spoiler warning; The ending dialogue hint towards a rally themed sequel gets my nerd senses tingling and I hope to see that realized one day as the base here is exceptional.There's definitely something here. Maybe not a ton, but something. Fun to be had for an afternoon. A perfect bundle game but might have trouble standing up to scrutiny as a lone purchase.			"

												Four hours doesn't seem like a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but Absolute Drift delivers on a challenging yet relaxing drifting experience in that amount of time.It's absurdly minimalistic, but this isn't a sugar coated arcade game. You will need some skill from previous racing games if you expect to play the game without becoming discouraged at constantly crashing. The drum and bass soundtrack coencides and enhances the gameplay, and the lack of any visual clutter in the game makes for a zen like experience once you have the hang of drifting.

After getting the hang of it however, you will find yourself having fun with it, and doing things you thought impossible with ease.I often come back to it and play levels multiple times trying to obtain a better score than my highest, and I find myself getting better at it as I play.

												I got this through the Humble Bundle and have been on the fence about wether I actually enjoyed it.I had alot of difficulty getting the hang of the drifting mechanic, they are very sensitive and turning without spinning out is not common. Despite the driving mechanics I completed the main missions and got all the achievments. By the end I actually was starting to enjoy the game if only slightly. I still couldn't get the hang of drifting though.The visuals are very basic but adds to the theme of what I presume is Chinese Purgatory. I also was pleased to see full controller support.Overall, this game gets 6/10 from me.			"

			Here is my review in a few for Absolute Drift: Zen Edition Buy the game here: store.steampowered.com/app/320140/ My written review can be found on steam here:...		

+Visuals+Soundtrack+Steam Controller+Mad Drifts+Leaderboard asyncronous multiplayer.-No storyAbsolute Drift is a game about a man with a family to save from the Yakuza and the only bid they’ll take on their lives is if you beat their leader in a drift-off, so you play a montage of training until the final battle scene like every kung fu movie.  Wait that’s not right…  So there’s no backstory.  You’re just a car with mad drifts.It’s a very simple concept, drift as much as you can, chain together drifts, and get points.  The more points you get, the higher your score, the farther up the leaderboards you go.  There’s a large open-world area where you can complete challenges like drifting around certain objects, performing jumps, and collecting spinning plus-signs.  It’s sectioned off into areas, and you must complete objectives in each area before advancing to the next one resulting in solid progression as your personal skill improves.There are dedicated tracks with leaderboards (as mentioned earlier) that allow you to compete against others asynchronously, which are placed around the open world map for you to find.  If exploration is less your thing however, you can find the tracks on the main menu as well and jump right in.  These tracks can have one of two types: open areas with trick spots, and race tracks that record both your time and your drifts.The controls are easy to pick up, tough to master -- Or maybe I just suck.  It’s definitely not a game to play keyboard only, as feathering drifts is nigh impossible, so a controller of some form is a must.  It also has some really nice feedback on how good your drift is through rumble, which translates well onto a steam controller.Graphics wise, it’s visually pleasing.  It’s very easy to tell what is where and what’s important, and there is never enough on screen to get busy.  With a pleasantly good looking drift line showing your mad skills, you can watch your past as you tear up the present.Overall it’s an enjoyable game and worth picking up on sale for a few hours of fun.  It’s not going to keep you gripped for a dozen hours, but it’s better than your average movie with a lower admittance fee. "

												The main campaign is pretty short and I'm really bad at this game....so why am I thumbing it up? Well...the main mechanic (drifting a car) has a learning curve that is fun to do. Yes, I slam in every wall I can find and even some more, but Absolute drift doesn't beat me over the head with it. Rather the contrary: the way everything is set up, this is more like a playground than you having to be somewhere. And if the campaign was longer (even twice the size wouldn't be called big), I'm sure I would have gotten better (I mean...I started out as ""absolutely terrible"", so I made progress ;) ).The atmosphere is what you get in the preview: minimalistic (near abstract) visuals and an absolutely awesome soundtrack. I absolutely like it.The thing is that I'm not sure who to really recommend it to. Top down racers were always hard to handle (I mean...I loved super off road on the SNES exactly because inevitably someone of the group would drive COMPLETELY off), and with no other car in sight, this game is like the test drive for these other games.There's certainly mastery in here. I just think I didn't come close to it (I usually ended the races throughout the game in the bottom 10%). For those who find mastery like this engaging, I guess? :-)			"

												Short (less than three hours to 100% achievement) though very enjoyable game with an XBOX360 controller. The ""end game"" is attempting higher scores on specific tracks while the ""main game"" is progress through 6 worlds, with the 6th being no more than a play to wrap the game up and roll credits.Don't buy this game if you're expecting realistic physics or even blow-off valve accuracy - you contantly paint black tyre marks which gives a nice artistic feel to your movements, though I would have much preferred a way to only show tyre marks only when actually skidding. This isn't a drifting simulator. This isn't a racing game. This is a chilled out explorer and you play the role of an AE86.I hope they make Absolute Drift 2 and give more substance. An ability to modify the car that would have an effect on the physics would be cool as well as camera angles. Obviously multiplayer for some door-on-door drifing action would be great and anything to make this a game that you'd want to go back to once you unlocked everything that needed to be unlocked.Is it worth US$11.99? For a three-hour ish game? That's only a maybe. It had been on my wish list for a long time and it blew me away seeing it on HumbleBundle so keep an eye out - this game is definately worth it if you can get it discounted.			"

												Game has a learning curve but it's a lot of fun when you get past the frustration of running into walls. Once you get good at the game you feel like one cool dude. >8-)*EDIT* Beta update has fixed issues such as losing combos from jumps and it's now easier to keep your combo in general. Also its added a clutch and restart button :ok_hand: I finished the game (100% Acheivement) using Automatic and Medium difficulty. However you'll get the most out of this game using Manual gearing and Hard difficulty which allows much more control, though I don't recommend using these settings untill you get the basics down. Some basic understanding about how cars work and also drifting definetely helps but is not essential. There is an excellent guide on the community forums which helped me out going into manual gearing. I went from bad scores to consistantly getting top 1% thanks to the guides and a lot of practice. A lot of the replayability is going for personal bests. Though it is a bit frustrating at times seeing the top 8 scores are usually 2x my best at the least. Also driftkana is a lot of fun but the best scores are just exploiting the best area to do one big continuous donut which isnt the games highpoint (but still heaps of fun :p). Controller is recommended but honestly not needed. There are videos of top scores on youtube from people who are using a keyboard.			"

												This is a really fun game, reminiscent of Drift Legends, a game I used to play on iPhone.It doesn't hold your hand; it gives you a few pointers, and then lets you get into it.For most people who play car games on a regular basis, it's easy to get into, but still hard to master. For those who don't play car games, you're probably not going to enjoy it as much - read most of the negative reviews - they complain about not being able to handle. I say, GET BETTER!Graphically, it's very minimalistic isometric style (even the menu) - much like Kill The Bad Guy - and it works most of the time, except your car can get hidden behind building at times: this is probably the only bit of frustration that could have been avoided had they designed it so buildings get translucent when the car is behind them.Sounds work - again, very minimalistic, but they work - and the engine sounds are unique as well, not all boring same-as.Physics are pretty good, and the cars all handle different - some more different than others - you will want to experiment to find which one fits you best (I really liked the Hoonivan).The only real cons I have are the aforementioned inability to see cars behind buildings, and the listed retail price (I got it for $1, but it's probably worth $5, not the price listed on Steam). I've played about 7hrs, and seen all there is, the only thing to keep me coming back is to increase my scores on levels.Conclusion: great little drift game, definitely worth playing. It's in a bundle right now, so snap it up.EDIT: I thought I'd mention it IS playable with keyboard, but A LOT easier to play with a controller, because you really need throttle control (like most car games).

												This game is actually pretty fun to play, I like it, even knowing I'm pretty bad, even after fixing my problems, still fun.Pros: It's has some nice gameplay and a great soundtrack, really fun to play when bored or when you're in the mood for some fun smashing into things, drifting long distances, or topping those leaderboards.Cons: This might just be for me, but I plug in any controller, and I'm always turning left, so a few control bugs for controllers (I have restarted my computer after I noticed this problem and it was not fixed, I used both a 360 and XBone controller), very little customization, which shouldn't really be a con because it just came out, so I can understand that.Overall, I'd recommend this game to my friends, aside from the problem I had, that can easily be avoided by disconnecting the controller(s).(Review will change as game is updated)			"

You have to do certain challanges to get to new worlds. You also have to do the drifting events in order to unlock other things. This game sadly has no wheel support.( If it does it dosen't work well) This game is also very cheep and affordable. For the money that you pay I find that this game is worth it. But!!! This game does have one draw back. It kinda gets boring after doing it for more than a few hours. Other than that this game  is well worth the money.			"

												I think it is a cool concept. However i feel its a bit repetetive, i have not completed the game but from what i have played so far it was all the same, with different levels. You basically drive around looking for the events and, its the same over and over again, where you have to drift under or around something. If you want a chill game, this is the game for you. If you want something challenging and entertaining go somewhere else.			"

 General Good game to lose a few hours although over priced for the amount of actual game play hours. UI The UI is simple and easy to use. The graphics matches well with the style of the game. Graphics As you can see from the example images the graphics are stylized. It looks great and love the long tire marks showing the smooth drifts that you are creating. Game Play There is not much game play hours in this game and it can be completed very easily and quickly. Getting the hang of holding drifts is a different matter. Using the easy settings is well... easy but using the hard settings can be difficult. Even to turn the car in the correct direction you want to go can be a struggle. After a while you will become used the mechanics and start getting decent runs and scores. However I do feel that the game is too pricey for what you get. I wouldn’t recommend this game  "

												I want to love this game, I really do. The Japanese theme is beautiful, the art style is minamilistic and flawless, but theres one thing that for me lets this game down:The Controls.Now I understand that for some people the controls might be perfect, but for me I found them fidly and hard to work with, whenever I slightly turned I would spin off, hand braking felt tempromental with sometimes it being smooth and perfect but then other times it was too much and I would proceed to spin out over and over trying to get back to a straight path. I'm not the most patient person ever either, so practicing while a valid way to master the controls it just feels teadious when it shouldnt be. Ill be honest the sound effects dont help, any time you break a combo it gives you an irritating sound, the sound of the car is loud and intrusive and just doesn't fit with the art style. Now this is a very long rable, I know, I just felt the need to bring it up.Now I bought this game on The Humble Bundle meaning I paid a pound for this, 1001 Spikes and SnakeBird, so I dont feel like I wasted my money on this, I just need time with it so I can master it. But for now, this gets a down vote, I might change my opinoin if I become better at the game!			"

I can't recommend this game for the following reasons:   - Short gameplay I finished the game and all achievements but 1 within 5 hours, and the last achievement would take 5x the time it took to get the others. So it doesn't have much gameplay at all.  - Gets repetetive Very repetetive, nothing is new introduced the further you progress into the game except for the first few worlds. The last ones are just super boring (which cause you to skip levels = less gameplay) - Skip the game? If you'd like you could skip all levels and just complete some tasks to head straight on to the next world. Did they realize that people would get so bored playing it so they just added a skip?  - Very difficult It's very challenging, which I suppose could be a positive thing, but I've completed the game and I still feel as bad as I did when I started out. I didn't learn much at all and I dont get good scores on any maps, even though that buddha told me that I'm a ""Drifting Master"" at the end of the game.  - Default settings suck The default settings are terrible - atleast they were for me. With ""easy"" mode, drifting assist and 50% turn sensetivity toggled (they are toggled by default) I found it super hard to drift, it felt like I had no control over the car whatsoever. I had to experiment with the settings and ended up putting on ""hard"" mode, no drift assist and 80% turn sensetivity to make it feel natural. I don't know, it was just really time consuming and annoying.  - Repetetive music All the songs sound the same. (People tagged this with great soundtrack, ouch) + Graphics The only positive thing that I can think of are the simple graphics, I really enjoy those. It looks pretty neat.(But it hurts your eyes if you play with a white car, since everything else is white aswell. Lost my car a few times before painting it black) Conclusion I suppose if you really have no other games to play, you like games that you will have to practice for, you got your own music, you like racing games and this game is on 80% sale or in a humble bundle - It's fine to buy it!Otherwise, don't. Sorry for possible grammar mistakes.			"

												This game is awesome. I would have so many more hours logged, but I torrented the game because I didn't feel like paying, but I just bought it today because I felt so bad for the devs. Even though they probably have tons of money from the tons of sales this amazing game should bring in, it is too good of a game to pirate.Absolutely awesome arcade style drifting, I often boot this up and play in windowed mode for a bit while waiting for stuff to download/update/load or really anything.It's an awesome and simple timewaster, comes with some awesome music (that I didn't even realize because I previously only played during school so no audio hahaha), and the driving physics feel great.The new Zen update is awesome with the night mode, but I haven't checked anything else out new,I actually came to complain though, the tink noises are waaay to loud. I wanna blast the great music and hear the cars bangin that redline but I can't turn up my volume because the tink noise when getting score point or (even worse) when losing a multiplyer hurts my ears!Everything else about this game is sooo good and if you want to just drift around for fun I cannot recommend any game more than this.

												“I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I drift.” I played this one back when it was an Alpha probably a year ago. It’s still just as much fun as I remember it being back then. I love the open structure / free roam nature of it. Progressing through it feels like a natural evolution instead of blocked off levels. And that art style... it's just gorgeous. This is definitely one I can see coming back to and replaying even after I beat it. Even after you finish the specific objectives it's a lot of fun to simply drive around the map.Video Review:

												Saw a few videos about this game, and they made it look easy. The controls seem to take a lot of time to master no matter which controller I was using. Was always difficult to get the right balance of throttle/steering/gear to finally get a good drift going, only to then make one wrong move and it all go horribly bad in a hurry. I picked this game up because it looked like good relaxing fun, but the learning curve and handling are just not doing it for me. Trying the tutorials over and over again just leaves me scratching my head and wondering how everyone else is having such and easy go at it. At least I bought it on sale, so I didn't lose out on too much.			"

												If you are a racing game enthusiast then you likely have the skillset and experience required to dive in and enjoy this game but a more casual person like myself it is pretty much unplayable. If you are a patient person looking for a challenge or timewaster you might consider this, even without a racing game resume.- Lack of information in HUD, not even basics like what speed you are going or what gear you are using.- ""Tutorial"" is a challenge room not a tutorial, it's like throwing a baby in a lake and hoping it learns how to swim.- No practice area/training room to compensate for the problems stated above.- As the title suggests drifting is crucial but not taught in the game and this is a technique, not a button you press so combining all the above problems I just can't recommend this game.

My Review For Absolute DriftFirst off Absolute Drift is an amazing indie game. It has solid controls when using controllers (which it is recommended to play with) and also suprisingly solid keyboard controls. For the sake if this review I tried out using a keyboard and even though it doesn't have the same feel to it and is a little harder, it still has that exciting wow factor when you string together drifts. If you to like to play indie games or have an interest in drifting get this game. You can do 3 different event types, Drift course, Driftkhana and Mountain drift with a free-roam mode that I would consider to be like a campaign You do missions to unlock different areas and different events. I think the 92% Positive reviews can vouch for itself seeing as this is a greenlight game.Edit- Oh and the audio is amazing too! Great songs it's edm and the engine sounds are spot on for a drifting game hearing the rpms going ham.			"

												Clean, cheap, fun and addictive. 8/10Simple drift game, easy to pick and strangly addictive, for a game for less then £10 you usually struggle to find anything all that great but this is different. All the fun of drifting and something for a little downtime. For someone into drifting or car games in general this is a fun little break from the lap after lap you find in regular games in a clean enviroment.The only downfall is some of the achievements bug and the music can become annoying if it isn't your thing but could easily be turned off but a way to impliment your own music would be great.Solid purchase if you're looking for something fun and reletively cheap!

												Highly addictive ""multiple try"" perfectionist type of game. Nice clean and minimalistic artstyle. No night/dark mode. Runs perfectly, other than the occasional smoke caused performance drop. Locked at 60fps by default, no option to change it in the settings menu. Sometimes I feel like the point registering system isn't quite accurate, as you can slide at quite an angle without it ever counting as a drift. Same goes for the point system in the end of a combo - when your combo ends, and you hit another drift just after, it can take quite a while for it to start registering it and giving you points. I had the infamous Xbox One controller bug on Windows 10 and trying to fix this issue by the standard troubleshooting guide yielded no results, neither did any of the publicly available beta options help. Got in contact the developer and they were kind enough to give the beta code for the Zen edition. After that, no problems. Props for the quick answer.			"

I am one of those persons who likes to complete their games and probably not play them too much afterwards.However, if you are one of those persons who really gets into a game and likes to aim for top scores, this could also be a game for you. Alot of different tracks to play on, there will always be competition of claiming the No. 1 spot on the leaderboards. The tracks are quite skill-based and keeps you playing them for quite a long time if you're aiming for a higher position on the leaderboards.			"

It takes a little while to get use to and there is some frustrating levels but the satisfaction when you complete them is unbeleiveable.

												I’m usually not much a fan of driving games these days. I used to play them a lot more when I was younger but at some point I just stopped having fun facing the same challenges again and again in every driving game. But I did enjoy drifting mechanics from time to time and since I got this game in a Humble Bundle, I decided to check it out.Unfortunately, I can’t really say I was having a great time with it. The first problem I had with the game were the controls. Giving cars realistic physical properties is difficult and more importantly, difficult for the player to control. Which is why most driving games focus on fun, arcadey feeling driving that doesn’t challenge the player too much with real world physics. Absolute Drift unfortunately goes a completely different route, eschewing physical car mechanics as well as typical tightly controlled driving of other games. Your car is almost always drifting. You can barely drive in a straight line and then enter a curve without the car breaking out at the back. This is also explained by the extremely wide turning radius that you drive while trying your best not to break out.Then again, drifting is the main attraction of this game so it makes somewhat sense for your car to be easily turned sideways. The problem is that the controls feel extremely floaty. Acceleration is slow as if your car weighs twice as much as a real car. And I sort of suspect that may be the case, since the easiest way to get a physics engine to behave this erratic is by increasing the mass of an object and then increasing the torque of the motor providing it with energy. This leads to very hard to learn drifting mechanics that can lead to much frustration. And I know some people will inevitably like it this way, if the scores on the leaderboards are anything to go by. But I just found it annoying. And this leads me to my next complaint: The camera. The game utilizes a bird’s-eye perspective which means when you’re driving towards the camera the controls are reversed and foreshortening makes it difficult to make out where you are in relation to the borders of the tracks. I would’ve much preferred a typical racing game camera hovering behind the car or at least one that follows the rotation of your car.But all of that could be forgiven if the game had actual content. Unfortunately, it doesn’t. There are plenty of levels there. But drifting around them is the only thing you do. There are no challenges beyond comparing your score to the global leaderboards. Coupled with the very minimalist aesthetic, that makes this game look extremely empty. If I didn’t know better, I’d assume it was still in early access. Which it very well might be, since the developers are adding new features with the upcoming Zen edition. And honestly, to me there isn’t much incentive to doing something very limited over and over again.The devs also highlight car customization and free-roaming areas as features and these are just not enough. You get to paint your car in a few different colors and that’s it. Free-roam is just an empty overworld filled with “challenges” which boil down to “drift between these two objects”, “donut around an object”, “collect 5 items in this part of the map” and “jump over an object with a ramp”. And those last two highlight how little there actually is to do in a game that is only about drifting.Honestly, if this weren’t part of a Humble Bundle that contained games I was interested in more, I probably would’ve stayed away from this game. There’s just not much there to enjoy here for me. But I do have to wonder if the price of $12 is justifiable, even though I paid nowhere near as much. Because the aesthetic is – like the developers’ previous game Race The Sun – deliberately minimalist and only features low-poly objects with basically no textures applied to them. And I can’t believe that it took that much effort to create the gameplay, since most engines nowadays feature basic driving mechanics as prefabs. If you’re into games with a very narrow focus and can deal with the repetition or if you’re the type that has to be competitive 100% of the time, you’ll find something to enjoy in Absolute Drift. But I honestly couldn’t recommend it to anybody else, since it’s just too light on content to be anything substantial.			"

The game itself is just brilliant and wonderfully done, looks very neat etc etc, but for being a 12€ game, it's got way too little to offer. I played the game through in ~5 hours. After that, there's just really nothing to do. The Zen update doubled my playtime, yet I'd still like more content to satisfy me for the dollars I paid.			"

												NOT NEGATIVE BUT NOT POSTIVE EITHERGot it with the humble bundle (wanted death trap and hand of fate). I really like the concept, design and the atmosphere. For me personally though it is unplayable with keyboard. Better suited to controller, where you can adjust the sensitivity of your turns. If you have controller and like drift games then ye, when it is on sale or if you want the humble bundle, not a bad little game. If not i wouldn't unless its going cheap.			"

												It's just...  Not fun.Slippery/hard controls.  In that you're ALWAYS drifting.  There's no ""Brake"" button to get you in or out of it, simply turning initiates drift, no matter how slight the turn is.There's no shift techniques, no load techniques.  It's basically trying to drive as a drunk person with a lead brick on the brake.			"

												It's a bit too challenging to get the hang of to me. But I still got through the entire free roam mode and experienced all the different modes in stable build at the time of this review. I have not tried whatever the Zen thing is, as it was not in free roam. Only took 1.5 hours to finish free roam... Even for the dollar that I paid to get it through humble bundle, I don't think I'm coming back to this one that often. my finers actually hurt after this one, which is a rarity for me in racing games. Not sure if it's due to my controller or what, but yeah... I personally would not recommend unless you're ready for a learning curve and a focus on getting better scores. If it was with a speed-based mode, then sure, I'd play more, but since it's strictly about points and it seems the drifting points are inconsistent for if it thinks I'm drifting and if I'm not... No thanks.On the plus side, the artwork and music are good. I just wish the controls weren't so awkward. (Then again I'm used to first person racing games or Mario Kart kind of games. And stuff like Burnout.)			"

												Compared to how a car normally acts when drifting, the fronttires have way to little grip. I know it is part of the game, but it makes it very difficult to get used to. The idea is great. 5 out of 5 for originality and idea and design/graphics. But what really kills it for me the the physics, the cars has sensation of oversteering and understeering at the same time. If you want a drifting experince, this is not the game. But if you want a great laugh this is quite entertaining.			"

												I really liked the look of this game - something I could play when I just wanted to chill for a bit. Nice minimalistic aesthetic, relatively simple idea, good game to play when you just want to relax, I thought.Now, I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong here, but the game never at any point actually teaches you how to drift. I've tried watching a few youtube videos of other people doing it, and it always just seems to work. I guess I'm just not a natural at it. Tha's fine, but I'd like to be taught how to improve.There are these levels labelled as ""tutorials"", but they are anything but. The initial ""drifting tutorial"" puts you on a circular track and says ""drift in a circle"". It doesn't actually tell me *how*. The tutorial for doing  donuts says ""do donuts"". The only actually useful pieces of information regarding how to drift are the quick pieces of text that appear during loading screens. Other than this, the game doesn't actually tell you how you are meant to play it.Like I said I really liked the look of this game, and really want to enjoy it. I don't doubt it's a good game if you are actually able to drift. To give this game a thumbs up rather than a thumbs down I would want to actual guidelines and tutorial within the game, so I can get to a stage where I am actually able to play it.			"

												First review, first time I regret having bought a game on steam. Even while I did so during the steam sales (7€) it feels expensive. The game is shallow : only five ""worlds"" - more like 50mx50m parking lots -, finished with mention ""master drifter"" even though I couldn't do a drift without hitting a wall.

												Minimalistic graphics and soothing soundtrack are nice but I really don't like having absolutely zero camera control. There are some spots where rotating the camera would have been very helpful. By far the biggest letdown is the physics and controller response. The ground feels like it is ice at best, and glass at worst. The game also does not seem to use the analog aspects of the controller. It felt like I was either getting full throttle, or none at all no matter how much I played with it.If you can get it dirt cheap on Humble Bundle like I did then go for it, but at any price higher than $1 it is not worth it.

												The game itself is great. The handling is a nice balance between being realistic enough to be challenging and rewarding but is arcade-like enough to remain fun. Reason for the negative review is the game suffers from FPS issues. Considering how low-detail the graphics are, it is ridiculous how poorly the game plays. The worst part is that earlier versions of the game did not have these issues and played great on my computer.I get persistant FPS drops, enough so that it screws up my drifts and makes the game not fun to play. This is with a computer above the minimum specs and happens no matter how low I turn the graphics settings down. A FPS limiter may stabilize the frame rates, but there is no provided option for that. The dev's only suggestion is to just turn the graphics down, which does not solve my problem.  Until the FPS issues are sorted, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Hard and unrewarding gameplay, have fun trying to not hit walls with a terribly handling car.The open worlds just have objectives that you can complete by just doing terrible drifts and most likely ramming into walls with your cars afterwards.Tracks are just extremely frustrating, hitting walls will or will not stop your combo randomly, sometimes the game will consider your drift was not drifty enough so it will also interrupt the combo, and yet again you just hit walls over and over againMinimalistic look that has nothing special to it, soundtrack that wanted to be ""chill"" but is just bland and repetitive.

												So recently nerdcubed posted a video about this game, and from what he showed it looked amazing.Don't get me wrong I love the music and art style, but the game is very repetitive and the bugs will drive you nuts.*Accelerates* *Car goes backwards*Want to brake? Yeah nah that's not happening.Going down a slope? Let's break that combo for you.Clip a kerb at the wrong angle? TO SPACE WITH YOU!!I feel as though so much more could be done with this game:-powerups---speed boost---slow down---gravity manipulation for longer jumps-racing ---same track with player-player collisions---mirrored tracksBut more importantly the player needs a reason to play. I am a completionist, and that's the only reason I kept playing; there was no story or incentive to continue playing it was just the same stuff over and over again. I go by a £1 an hour (to get 100%) and this game came just shy of that so I think it is well valued. But that time wasn't spent enjoying it, more just persevering through the pain of the bugs. The game has promise but given that it's 'released' I doubt the bugs will be fixed or anything new be added.			"

												I wanted to play this game with my Saitek Cyborg 3D Gold joystick controller. The controlls got all messed up, the game didn't let me quit and there was no way to make the joystick work. Without thinking, every PC game, which is about cars, should support either a joystick or steering wheel input. Sticking to the X Box or Sony PS controllers is a product of a sick mind. This is the PC platform, if I wanted to play with a toy, I would have bought a Nintendo.			"

												It's a strange game... Obviously it is not a simulator because of top down, but the control is very focused on simulation. How does it work out as together? Not very well.The game seems very easy-to-pickup, but it really isn't- you have to focus so much, the difficulty is as bad as simulator that requires actual good controller. Also, I felt that this game is incredibly slow paced. Maybe because of how much the camera zoomed out. So wiggled some setting, I also changed difficuly to easy (shamefully) and I felt no difference from Hard difficulty. Well there are no CPUs in this game, why does this difficulty thing exist for? Scoring??Graphic is sub-par, it is the modern ""low-poly"" style with very minimallistic color with very little environment. I've seen it enough of this, nothing really to praise for.Music selection is great. I liked every bit of it, and it kind of connects as if there is DJ in background.The control is the same as arcade style but asks you to play like simulator.The worst part for me was the price tag. I mean, does it really worth $12? I can find numerous alternatives that may cost bit more but worth lot more than this. I tried to like it, yes, I needed to play for at least a hour to make a fair review but 20 minutes was enough torture for me. It was too challenging and really wasn't that entertaining. Some flash game plays better, and it is free.If you play a lot of racing simulation, you might like this, but why pay for limited simulator when you might already have fully-controllable simulation game? That's the confusing part.In my honesty, I don't feel like picking this up again after this review... sorry.			"

5/10 - Absolute Drift goes round and round and round and round...Drifting has always existed as a sort of accessory sport to traditional racing. Flashy and dangerous, drifting — the act of taking a corner so as to lose control of the back wheels and cause the car to turn sideways — prizes style and precision over speed and vehicular power. Though organized events such as the US’s Formula D series exist they are still searching for a large audience, and outside of Japan drifting remains largely a novelty, something to spice up action movies and arcade racers but rarely thought of as a legitimate sport itself.Absolute Drift (2015) feels in large part an attempt to move away from drifting as spectacle, giving you a car and a road and letting you figure out the rest. The presentation is stripped down to blunt polygonal buildings and red highlights to tell you where to go, with your car itself a nondescript toy-sized vehicle only visible by its bright paint job and lengthy tire tracks.When placed next to the gleeful excess of Need for Speed or the cartoony impossibility of Mario Kart, Absolute Drift singular focus is clean and consolidated. Drifting is the literal name of the game, so drift away to your heart’s content, careening through rectangular roads that only further emphasize the exacting grace of your curve.In a 1995 interview on Jeremy Clarkson’s Motorworld, drifting progenitor and legend Keiichi “Drift King” Tsuchiya says that one of the reasons he began drifting was to entertain the crowd during racing events. It was almost always assured he would win, so drifting became a way to put excitement back into a race where the outcome was no longer the reason to watch. This ideology is a key component to drifting’s popularity in media and as a spectator event. Watching cars go fast is fun, but watching cars go fast and take turns in ways that seem to defy the laws of physics is exhilarating.One of Absolute Drift’s earliest contradictions is in its reliance on traditional events and score attacks as means of creating a sense of progression. Absolute Drift’s prevailing methodology is that drifting is itself reward enough, and that the problem with the way drifting is used in other media is that it has become deluded by the obsessive adoration paid to it by movies like The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). Drifting should be about the screech of your tires and the smoke of your skid marks, Absolute Drift seems to say as it positions drifting in an almost religious context (the game itself opens with a Shinto deity welcoming you into a sort of drift heaven).And yet here the game is asking you to do a donut around this building, or jump your car over this gap. The problem with Absolute Drift’s attempt at drifting solidarity is not that it doesn’t stick to that goal, but that it never could. As Zach Kotzer writes for Kill Screen, “drifting is not an absolute; it is a means to an end.” Absolute Drift needs its leaderboards and its car stunts because drifting in isolation just isn’t that interesting. Just as Tsuchiya incorporated drifting into his racing to spice up his corners, racing games have utilized drifting for the similar purpose of making themselves more interesting to play and watch.When you strip everything but drifting away from these games, sliding through corners begins to dull rather than excite. Absolute Drift may see drifting as an elevated form of racing, but there is a reason the sport has only ever garnered a niche audience. There are only so many ways you can drift the same turn before it starts to feel routine. This is a problem for games with far more robust handling systems than Absolute Drift can manage (your toy car feels like a boat cruising through a bowl of ice cream), which only exacerbates the problem as what is drifting but the precise understanding and control of a car’s grip and power.Absolute Drift’s devotion to a singular idea is compelling in its focus and clean production. Its sparse world is as easy on the eyes as the trance soundtrack is on the ears, and there is some fun to be had navigating these large sandboxes populated with fighter jets and Ferris Wheels. But that fun is akin to setting up a ramp and watching a Hot Wheels car fly down it, popping off the ground and begging you to do it again. Eventually you grow tired of this simple task and long for something more involving. But your toy is still just a Hot Wheels car, and this is still just a drifting game.You can find more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Absolute Drift has that borderline feeling between trying to be arcade and trying to be sim, and doing neither well. The camera angle says arcade, the fine control of steering says sim, the overall physics say they don't know what they are - and I don't know either.With the minimalist single-angle isometric style, they should have gone towards a challenging arcade experience, instead I got a frustrating blend of sim/arcade controls that is derived from what feels like a lightly modified UnityCar 2.0 asset package, which uses Pacejka curves and isn't great for drifting without code voodoo.The game still has potential to be fun, perhaps alternate camera angles providing a better perspective of what is going on would bring out the game's arcade/sim mixture better and make the controls more enjoyable. As it stands, it's a decent DnB playlist with a car game on top.			"

												Feels more like a tech demo than an actual game. No real story. You just drive around these open areas doing little objectives. There's basically only 4 objectives. That is making a jump, drifting between things, and drifting around something till you get 100%, and picking up collectibles. That's basically the whole game. There are tracks you can do, but you're just goign around drifting for points. The drifting is ok, but its very finnicky and oversensitive, leading to tons of spinning out. Having played many racing games requiring drifting, this isn't quit as well tuned. Sometimes you get everything right and it can be fun, but its mostly boring and repetitive. It's not inherently terrible, there's just not much to the game. Theres about 2-3 hours of playtime, which is a ripoff for the price, although I wouldn't want longer because of how you do the same thing from the first 10 min to the 3rd hour. 5.5/10.			"

												Played this for an hour and a half and got bored very quickly.The gameplay is very good don't get me wrong, probably the best top-down game I have ever played. Why i don't recommend;- Too easy to get though worlds- Some things holding a simple drift going is quite hard for simple things like no knowing where your wheels are-Seems very short and lacks content for £9- no multiplayer at all other than a leaderboard (boring)-level design seems poor, colours are very contrasted and hard to see things like containers which are the same colour as the path with very little shadow detailing-Music isn't the best, rather annoying at most-Engine sounds? not very good-there are better things / games to spend £9 on-rev limiter? what rev limiter other than a red number (thanks)Love the refund Scheme! Because now devs can't keep the money they get for a poor game.It's good for those that didn't expect much I expected things to be better.If you're still reading this far down you probably deserve a medal so have a cookie instead.

												Firstly, I love this game because you can drive all over Europe. You have to manage your money, and make sure that, when you get out a loan from the bank, you have enough money to pay it back, or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do 'Quick Jobs', and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.To conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game, I happen to disagree.			"

												As someone who absolutely adores the likes of Drifting royalty (In cars I mean) such as the Nissan skyline R33 & R34, Toyaota supra, Nissan silvia S15 and any of the other RWD monster, I can honestly say that the idea behind this game is quite entertaining...So yeah, I think it's Ok, but it can certainly be improved. I like that there some old school cars (what looks to be a Toyota AE86?). It's quite a steep learning curve, and it does take a little bit to get use to, but after the tutorials and exploring all the worlds, you sorta get a feel for it. I like that you get to control some of the car settings, but in all honestly, they don't really feel as though they make a difference. But that's about as far as I'll go.. I'll get on with the bad points first;BAD POINTS:- It feels like driving on ice. Not particularly Realistic. - There's not enough cars/designs- The music is repetitive, similar (but still nice)- What's with the Minimalist design?- It's too short a game (i.e. unlocking all the worlds)Good Points:- There's quite a few things to do (with the different modes and free roam)- It's simple, yet satisfying- It kinda remids me of ""Kill the bad guy""- What few cars there are, they all feel different to drift - You can select AUTO or Manual if you are a real car nerd!Overall, not a bad game. But I certainly wouldn't pay full price (Yep, I used ♥♥♥, and rightly so). I'd probably just keep your 9 quid and save up for the likes of Dirt Rally if you wanna do epic Skids. But that is just my opinion4/10			"

												Absolute Drift is a pure drifting game with minimalistic graphics.This game is clearly made for a very specific audience, i.e. people who are into drift racing. I don't count myself in this group and as a result didn't find much fun with the game.The game could also use better keyboard controls (I can't stand playing racing games on a gamepad) and the tutorials are downright terrible.If you are a drifting fan go ahead and buy the game. Not really recommended for anyone else.The good:- Nice minimalistic art style- Does one thing (drifting) wellThe bad:- Poor keyboard controls- Annoying soundtrack- Terrible tutorials			"

												The tutorial didn't teach me how to play. It doesn't even guide you on what kind of rhythm/speed is best to make good drifts. The loading screen keeps telling me, ""You're spinning out a lot. It's not about speed."" There isn't even an on-screen indicator of speed, it's a topdown view, and your max speed is already glacial. It's hard to even gauge my speed! Considering this game's so minimal and the developers didn't feel the need to properly teach me the game, I'm not going to play further.This has the least immediately fun driving I've played, and I've played Pac-Man World Rally. It's like driving through syrup. Feels dreadful.I also have an almost ideological opposition to this game. The fun of drifting isn't in being in loose, weightless control... it's about being in loose, weightless control as a means to more quickly make sharp turns and return to top speed ASAP. It's a rhythmic thing.Glad I got this in a Humble Bundle with a game I actually wanted.			"

												Initial impression is that this game is more of an arcade drift style. This is good considering the viewpoint, so handling feels rather good. The two cars that I have played with so far feel quite different, and sound different, which is a nice change compared to most car games these days. Controls: Arcade styling, crisp, and responsive, exactly as a game like this should be, although I haven't found a need to countersteer as much as the game insists you should yet. 9/10Graphics: Top down, flat styling, no fluff on the backgrounds, or track surfaces. This is great because nothing takes away from what you should be paying attention to. I would like to see more customizable options on the cars, maybe allowing custom paint schemes. 8/10Sound: The sound between cars is great, though the blow off valve on the first car can get a little annoying at times. 8/10Conclusion: I definitely recommend this game even in its early stages, the developer is quick to respond, and is very friendly. I see big things happening here, so this will definitely be one of the games to continue to keep an eye on if you are on the fence.  I would like to see multiplayer added, coop at the bare minimum, but a group of 10 cars drifting in tandem would be absolutely amazing.			"

The reason being that I want to warn you that playing with keyboard is very challenging and that I don't recommend playing without a controller. I would if I could but I am a Mac user, and connecting controllers is a task from hell. I hope to see this game come out in the near future on both Playstation and Xbox platforms in the near future, as I don't have money to buy a gaming PC, and it wouldn't be worth it for how little I game on computers.

												This is a really cool game for racing fans, especially those that either, A: feel let down with the lack of drift events in newer games such as GRID Autosport, or B: just like going for high scores on leaderboards. Great presentation and audio mean that it's a pleasure to sit there for an hour or two, plugging away at the High Score on the Driftkhana boards. Take it from me, at the time of the review, I'm ranked anywhere from 2nd to 6th on all of them.The cars handle nicely, and feel like they have a lot of weight to them. The drifting requires you to think ahead about where you want to end up, and requires minute adjustments as you fly around a corner in order to not crash. It requires a little bit of practice, and top down view can occasionally be disorienting, but overall the game controls well and it feels good. It feels good to slide around a corner at high speed, and consistently nail drifts in order to build up a multiplier and score high points. The games core mechanics are incredibly solid.The Mirror's Edge style visuals are also a nice touch, and give a lot of flair and personality to the game. The music makes for good background noise, and there are a couple of pretty good tracks that I actually find myself enjoying a lot.Really, my only complaint is the lack of custom maps. This sort of leaderboard-focused game seems designed to come with a map editor.			"

The driving mechanics are realistic enough that you need to practice to get top scores, it feels awesome to pull off a big combo.  Well worth asking price in my opinion, I have played about two hours, but I will be playing a lot more to get better scores.  A level editor would make this thing amazing!			"

												Absolute Drift is a game about drifting.It emphasizes timing, focus, reflex, and a nuanced comprehension of steering and gearshifting mechanics. However, this game does not have any technical stats or car-classes that allow you to tailor a car or course to your style. One engine and suspension type, cosmetic chassis, locked top-down view. The real nitty-gritty aspects of Drift Racing are left out of this simplified expression of the art.Absolute Drift is a game about Zen. Revelations abound as you learn by tooling about in an openworld-style drifting playground, where you are enticed to push your skills and remove the training wheels in exchange for more precision and direct control. This teaches you patience and encourages clear-minded serenity to tackle multiplier challenges and exceptionally long drifts. Letting go, both of your ego and your break, transforms each turn into a slice of transcendent meditation. But there is more to Absolute Drift than letting go.Absolute Drift is a game about drive. The drive to turn each course into a masterpice, one gear-shift at a time. Rather than listed names and a ladder leaderboard, you are given global player percentages, and where you fall in the over all community based on each course and event you complete. More than that, the urge to paint the tarmac with sublime compass-curves and deft switch-back transitions. It motivates you so effortlessly that time and anxiety fade away in the clouds of rubber smoke trailing behind you.It's a good game.			"

												This has got to be the most artistically beautiful yet physically challenging game I've EVER played. I love every bit of it: the minimalist design, the hard-as-nails gameplay, the sly anime references. Everything about this game oozes with elegance; it's practically a racing game in a ball gown. Definitely check it out!!I've got to add that getting good at this game makes you feel so amazing. When you come really close to a wall in a drift yet manage to pull away from it without ending the drift, you just feel like a drifting master. I've never felt this kind of satisfaction from a game before. Absolutely life changing. Pick it up; it's a must-have! :D			"

												I played the game all the way through but I haven't completed all the objectives. In my opinion, however, I recommend this game because it's ease of jumping straight. It's great for beginners who are figuring out the general basis of drifting, and then control settings can be changed so it feels more like simulation. I also really enjoy the drift/gymkhana aspects of it.			"

I very much enjoyed my few hours playing this game.  To summarize my feelings about it: it was a perfect delivery.  Very simple; very fun.Mood/tone: neat, fascinating, mostly professional.Music: doesn't wear its welcome through the amount of time you need to complete the whole base game, though may become annoying after that or during specific events.Gameplay: flawless; exactly as intended.Sound & Effects: each of the cars sound unique and have fantastic engine noises, and sound effects like crashing or falling into the water make the game seem a little more 'cute,' especially as you are in a relatively small car with a wide and pulled-back viewing angle from the camera.INITIAL PLAY VALUE: 10/10REPLAY VALUE: 9/10TOTAL SCORE: 10/10I highly recommend you play this for yourself if you like a simple edge to racing games.  It is well blanced, fun, and lasts as long as it needs to.  You will not be disappointed, especially if this initaily appeared to be a type of game you would play.			"

												This game is so fun and addicting, and for the price you can't complain. Its got a pretty short story mode, but depending on how fast you complete the missions you could probably finish it within an hour or two. There aren't a ton of tracks but the replayablity off the tracks is really high, it's almost like an arcade game, competing for the high score of the Steam community. There is only a handful of cars, but they all handle a little bit different.  I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy a top down racing game with a lot of competive features, its also really easy to learn how to play.			"

												Really sweet, original, physics based car simulator. The simple artwork is a nice change from more flashy drift-based games, and if you like D&B, this game is probably worth it for the soundtrack alone. Not much new content has been released in the last few months, leading to a bit of stagnation in play time, however, if you get it on sale, you can get at least ~7 hours out of it, and get about a dollar per hour of play time.

												An true gem, and a great example of low-key development in the ever expanding steam library.As a casual racing fan with an enourmous love for drifting, powersliding, getting sideways etc. this title instantly hooked me with it's appeal to minimalism in favour of gameplay and SFX. At first glance it's easy to dismiss as a 'one and done' kind of game from the newgrounds flashMX era, but before the first song has even finished you'll be stoked to try and push that score a little higher, or make that turn a little smoother. From initial launch to the ZEN edition update, the dev has been recieving (and responding to!) feedback about the game, and it's clear that fans' interests/concerns have been addressed at a steady pace. This is very encouraging, and likewise i think the creator/s know how much we love them <3If you're interested in drifting, racing, smooth electronic+techno, or something to put time into on a rainy day - Look no further.

												This game is great. It has a very high skill ceiling and its a pretty tough game to get into, but once you do it feels fantastic. The music is fantastic, and fits the gameplay like a glove. The graphics are beautiful and simple, which is perfect for this sort of thing. The high score system leaves the game with heaps of replayability, banging your head against the wall again and again to get 30000 extra points. And there are plenty of walls to bang your head into, believe me.There is one gripe I do have though, which is that the Hoonivan is just too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly good to excuse using any other car for going for high scores. For example, on Kobe, Das Whip has a cap of like 4 million possible points on a perfect run while the hoonivan with its ridiculous drifting and cornering ability can get up to 6 or 8. It does kind of irk me that there isnt much downside to the hoonivan; many other cars have something that balances out their strengths (also known as a weakness) but the hoonivan is just good in literally every way.

												Strangely relaxing, yet, incredibly frustrating.  I sit down with this game with the intent to play it for just a few minutes and end up sitting for over an hour.  And to make matters worse, the more angry and frustrated you get, the worse you play.  So many times I'll be just of the verge of pure rage and I'll ""woosaw"" and come back and nail what I was working on, which feels and looks awesome.The game itself looks incredibly basic, call it minimalistic, and truthfully, there isn't really a whole lot to it.  Most of the game is played in ""free roam"" mode, where you drive around various parts of a gymkhana like city including docks, parks, city centers, and airports looking for events and challenges to complete to unlock the next section of the city and more cars.  The top down perspective is pretty odd, but if you have a mind for driving RC cars, its not so bad.  The game is inexpensive and a quick download and will certainly occupy hours of your time.			"

												With being #1 on a level and almost top 10 on all the others, this game is highly addicting. --The Good-- Lots of playtimeLow costPlenty of content95% consistant gameplayGreat sound trackRival your friends on leaderboard (ph4ntom)Awesome art styleWell polished--The Bad--First hour will make you rip your hair outCars do not act like a full sim which i believe it should beCant drag the tail of the car on the wall for more points, instead get pentalized.The non races allow you to do the same thing over and over for 2 minutes where it should make you stop getting points when you dont move locations.Frame drops (could possibly be from the tire tracks garbage collection)Over all I would pay $30 for this game and highly recommend it to anyone that likes trials or racing games.

												It's... Decent, but it needs a lot of work. I've smacked into a wall several times without losing a drift combo only to lightly brush it later and have it count that as hitting the wall. And how it determines whether you are ""drifting"" seems totally random. I also find it quite odd that, while most drifts I do are not considered drifts, it does count me spinning out as a drift.Also, the handling feels very realistic. While that would normally be a good thing, combining it with a fixed aerial view and no HUD whatsoever makes controlling the cars very confusing and almost impossible.The free roam mode is really the only thing that's fun, and that only lasts a few hours. Not really worth $15.			"

												A fun little game with a GREAT soundtrack and a cool minimalist style.The free-roam mode (the ""story""-like mode) is about 90 minutes of play depending on how much you suck. Could probably be speedrun much faster. There's a bunch of drift and driftkhana tracks each with their own leaderboards, so the competitive leaderboard types of players will probably get much more than 90 minutes out of this game. The drift mechanics seem mildly accurate, for a really low-grip world.Unfortunately the goal detection is kinda dodgy. Where you have to do donuts around an object, you actually just have to be drifting a certain angle, not even in the correct direction, within some radius of the object. You'll accidentally half-complete some objectives driving past it. Drifts to complete objectives don't have to be successful, you can slide past, tick off an objective, and then slam into the wall (the exception to this is that actually hitting clipping points doesn't give points, and donking donut objects sometimes resets them). The result of all this is that you can basically fumble your way through the whole game (you do gotta git gud for the leaderboard modes though).Also there's a difficulty setting that seems to do nothing. I don't even know.All up - it's a fun little toy, but it's not really a complete product.			"

												First of all: Don't let the simplified graphics fool you. This is actually a pretty hard game. To perfect a drift (not hitting anything along the drift) is quite a challance.

												Soo this game.... were do i start?If you love drifting, turbo whistles and hooing then this is the game for you.Word of caution though here are a few things i need to mention -NO WHEEL SUPPORT (ps4 and xbox controllers only)-Pretty much unplayble on keyboard -really simple graphics-Top down view only-You either will love the music or hate it (its a mics of Dubstep/Trap/EDM)-JDM only cars-The whole 'map"" is divided into different zones that are locked at first and are unlocked through challeges (note that  untli now i have not experienced any loading screens between these zones since you drive to them) -THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING AND NOT SIMPLE AND YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF DRIFITING ABILITY IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST FUN OUT OF IT.Despite this i love this game its just simple unadulterated drifting and hooing in zones full of tracks and challenges to do.  The game has a nice art style were the map and track are white with a few brightly colored buildings to mix things up and your car is the paintbrush. The game is nicely optimized and I can definitly see someone playing this on an unplugged laptop (Provided you have and controller). The game is just soo fun i can't stress this enough. The game is easy too get into but hard to masterand you willl spend hours trying to get to the top of the leaderboard.  The physics of this game are awesome and you cant just go full throttle into a bend and expect not to spin out this isnt need for speed but this just emphasizes the fact the this game needs wheel support i think i would be much nicer if it did. The game also has a sense of humor in the way it presents itself and its tutorials and the names of the cars, and since it doesnt take itself too seriously and you can just fun with it. So if like turbo whistle and slithering around a bend like your in Tokyo drift this is the game for you.  "

												At first I sucked horribly at drifting at this game. I was spinning out and smashing into everything. But after about 2 hours of playing, I'm really enjoying myslelf. I'm flinging around everywhere (on purpose now. lol).There are many different ""races"" that you can spend a lot of time on perfecting. Heck, I went back and played the oval track for 30 minutes trying to improve my score more and more. And that's only one track! There's also freeroam with some large areas to play around in (and do missions) and a more arena like mode.The physics are spot on, the controls are tight (once you get use to ihem), the music is great, and the art is purely amazing.10/10 game.

												This game features 3 level types: A-to-B mountain tracks, freestyle drift courses, and 3-lap race tracks. The free roam map has additional missions you can perform only once, such as donut around a light pole, drift between buildings, jump over a river, etc.I was pretty terrible with the drift controls for most of the game, but finally seemed to start figuring it out near the end. (The controls work just fine; I am just not very good at drifting.) Despite repeatedly crashing into walls, I really enjoyed playing this game. I enjoyed the game even more once I finally figured out how to drive and drift. I particularly loved driving around the map in free roam and discovering new missions to complete. The minimalistic art style and varied environments provides for a beautiful game that keeps you coming back for more.Pros+ Beautiful minimalistic art style+ Many missions to complete+ Large soundtrack with ability to skip tracks whenever you want+ Ramps! Launch your car into the air and spin out of control+ Customizable car body and paint jobs+ Controller supportCons- Not much replayability once you've completed all free-roam missions- Difficult learning curve for controls- Only three types of levels gives feeling of repeating the same thing over and overThe game trailer video perfectly shows a taste of what you'll experience playing this game.

												I genuinely wish I could give a neutral review for this one. The game is not bad. In fact, it is very good at what it does.Absolute Drift is a minimalist drifting game, in which you're a white (can change) car, in a white world, with white objects everywhere. Except for a few things. Orange colored objects are destroyable and/or important. Each ""world"" also seems to have another flavor color splashed in periodically. (i.e. Yellow in world 2, Blue in world 3, etc.) And each ""world"" you unlock by completing various ""missions"" (such as doing donuts, spins, drifting between obstacles, etc.). There are no time limits as far as I can tell, and it's just a very open-world (on a table top), relaxed, easy going drifting game with no rules, no conflict, and no consequences.All of that, it does EXTREMELY well. However, it is not FUN. At least not to me. I'm playing on an XBox controller, and I also tried it out on my keyboard. There's five controls. Gas/Accelerate, Brake/Reverse, Steering, and E-Brake. You can also remove automatic transmission and have another shift up/down pair of buttons available. But I found the shifting on this tedious, and without shifting the game is repetitive. You can learn to do all you can do within the first ten seconds of playing. Spinning only works in reverse as far as I can tell, and ""donuts"" are just, basically, a slow lazy drift. When you are told to donut something, you can get 10%, crash, and get 10% more, crash, and repeat until complete. I've played plenty of other racing games with drifting components, and a few other drifting-centered games. This one, you have significantly less control over your vehicle. And the way the game calculates a ""drift"" you can literally drive straight up to your obstacle and slam on your brakes and succeed in just about any of the ""missions"". There is no incentive I can tell to do well (other than placing higher in the global rankings), and no punishments if you just crash into a wall over and over until you succeed.To feel successful, one must suceed. To succeed, there must be a chance of failure. To avoid failure, one must learn. Learning is caused by either positive or negative reinforcement, or some combination. This game has none. Perhaps I just suck at this game, but I didn't find it fun.TL;DR: If you want a laid-back drifting game with no clear rules, where you can just drive around a pristine environment to your hearts content, this is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.#TOFU #JDM #HOONEDIT: It doesn't seem to be recording my time correctly. Anyone who's played it knows it takes longer than ""0.1 hours"" to get that far.			"

												Learn how to drift cars like a pro... and learn other stuff about going sideways fast. My friends seem to be more into this game than I am... and they think a rotary is a garden tool. Still, the game is fun and addictive, features cool looking car replicas, has some pretty good car customisation options and is really, really popular right now. Pick it up on sale if you can cause if I'm honest, you won't regret buying this game.Honestly, if you like doing skids while banging to some beats, I'd highly recommend listening to the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 2,3 and Outun 10 BGM's while playing this game, nothing beats those songs when you're hitting a perfect run.

												I like the idea of drifting, but its expensive in real life. Also, I don't know enough about it to get value out of a decent computer setup.This game is perfect for me. The top down perspective allows me to see what is really going on.A mix of challenges and smaller tasks to complete keep the game fun but also extremely challenging.The physics work so well for drifting. The cars don't turn well enough to complete the courses comfortably with grip driving. You'll start drifting naturally, though maybe poorly. It's so easy to at least get started. The difficult part is getting the right speed and angles.This game is tough. It isn't perfectionist, but you still need to slave away at it to get better. Each course has different transitions between drifts, tight and loose turns, and ways to score bonus points. You'll ace one track and then have to learn the next one almost from the ground up.The Mirror's Edge aesthetic, smooth movement, music, and simple presentation all make for a beautifully designed game. I highly reccomend this.			"

												This looks like a fun little game! Unfortunately, the controls are not configurable. The pre-defined keys are the arrow keys to control the car. This is very awkward on my laptop keyboard, and causes my fingers to cramp. I much prefer the traditional QAOP layout - but it is not possible to change the mappings. I'll happily come back and give this game a second go if they put in that basic functionality. But until they do, it's unplayable for me.**EDIT** as MOW points out, thi IS available - with a little leg-work! I shall amend the keys and play on.			"

												I absolutely loved this game.It has very basic elemental controls which leads way to unlimited improvement (of self)I understand that the game has very simplified looks, but if we had two functions-Recording drifts (and playback olso)-Some sort of visualization for throttle, rev and brakes for that you could understand who did what kind of tricksThese two can turn this fabolous game into a spectator sport.GG WP guys :)			"

												Absolute Drift is a lot of fun.  Once you get a hang of the controls, you'll be drifting along effortlessly and feel just a little bit like Fujiwara Takumi.The game has 3 modes: Drift Track, Driftkhana, Mountain.  Each presented in a clean, minimal look and feel, which in my mind, enhances your experience since there's no distraction from what this game is about: Drifting.Drift track is simply what is says: a track to drift around.Driftkhana can be said to be a timed playground with boxes to knock over, demarcated areas to spin in, make doughnuts and just in general do as many drift tricks as you can in the set amount of time.Mountain is similar to Drift track, only the ""track"" mimics a mountain downhill where you traverse it from end to finish.The aim in each of the modes: score the as many points as possible.At first this is quite difficult as you get to grips with the car and the handling.  But the controls are forgiving, as are the physics.  Soon you'll learn the limits of the car and the ins and outs of the handling and physics together, throwing the car around like second nature.Furthermore, connecting all of the events, are hub areas (5 in total), each containing between 18 and 25 missions to complete.  Complete all missions in an area to unlock the next.You can also access all of the events from the main menu and jump straight in if you like ( no need to unlock them first ).Absolute drift is great for simply relaxing and pouring out any stress you have into the satisfying act of watching a micro-machine sized car, drift around corners, boxes, containers and trains.Highly recommended.NOTE: Absolute drift is purely a singleplayer experience.  Don't approach if you this is a drift racing game.			"

												absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, hard, and apparently wireless controllers dont work very well, but my wired xbox 360 controller worked flawlessly. its so satisfying when you perfectly drift through a corner, and it is a uncommon occurence on hard. I had difficulty getting into the top 30% on easy in the drifing maps. the controls are flawless, its not supposed to be controllable easily, and you never spin out, its supposed to be a challenge, the price point at 11 dollars i feel might be high, but i got it for approx 33 cents using humble bundle soooooo. its a great pickup if you love a good challange, and are ready for it to be like when in gta your going full speed, and you cant control at all allways. I am a generally good player from practice in lots of games though and this might just anger you from difficulty without a controller, i played with keyboard for a while and didnt really get angry, but i usaully dont at games. TLDRgood buy,fun.hard wired controller reccomendedpossibly too expensive "

												A minimalistic and solidly built driving game with a very zen atmosphere. My only complaint is I wish there was more, and possibly some type of multiplayer racing. Simple but well done and connected feeling driving mechanics, with a range of cars you unlock that are representative of the drifting scene. (240, AE86, Supra, Stagea etc.)I wish controls were more easily customizable within the game (you have to hold shift while starting it to customize and each time you launch to keep them)			"

												Great art direction - minimalistic, soft colors, and sharp edges combine into a pleasing visual experience. Tire tracks show your course and how to replicate it (or not). A calming soundtrack is paired with the screaming of your car's engine, which can get a little annoying, but is also consistent enough to drown out with the music.Gameplay is centered around point-based driving, drifting around corners as close as you can, as fast as you can, and as sideways as you can. The gameplay is enticing and draws in perfectionists; I had a lot of good fun honing my times!I've played this on my friend's account with a Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed it for hours. I got this part of the latest Humble Bundle and tried it out with my Xbox One Elite controller. The support for said controller, as well as the Xbox One controller and the Wireless Dongle, is broken. No matter what I do the controller pulls to the left constantly.The fixes for the XONE controller are hit and miss - works for some, doesn't work for others, but they are just workarounds. A game like this needs inherent support for controllers. My DS4 controller did not work either.I'm hesitant to recommend Absolute Drift. I had a lot of fun before I switched to the current generation of controllers. I would avoid this game if you use the current controllers; if you use a 360 controller or use KB/M (I would recommend not to), then you should be fine.EDIT: The developer supplied a beta version of the newest build of the game and it solved my control issues. Now Absolute Drift, once the beta version is pushed to live, is a game worth recommending.			"

												Fun little game that's captivating for short bursts of time. I would get it on sale as I don't think it's worth it at it's normal price, but if you're really into top down driving games I would go for it. Just a heads up, make sure you change the transmission settings to manual. The game has automatic set to default for some reason and it's almost impossible to control your car around corners or get the neccessary torque to start a drift without using the handbrake with auto.

												This is a racer where times don't matter - sliding cars around corners for points is the core mechanic.If you've ever played a top down or isometric racer before, this one has a great driving model. I've played using a logitech gamepad F510 and the car handles well, giving a sense of balance and yet still requiring care to avoid losing the back end and spinning out. All the cars feel like rear-wheel drive models,  so braking into the corner and burning rubber will float you round the corner. Burn too hard and spin out. Burn not enough and you'll lose your precious multipliers. Finding the balance is key.The roaming mode introduces you to the various driving challenges - loops, point-to-point and gymkhana events (where you drive as many tricks for points in 2 minutes). There is enough variety to keep the interest up - I completed the game in about five hours, so its not huge. However, I still have the urge to improve my scores - there are worldwide leaderboards to compare yourself against. Also the leaderboards show which car was used for the score - its not always the more powerful cars at the top...Recommended if you like driving games.			"

												The game is very neat and cute. There isn't much to do: you drift around a big map in free roam where you have some challenges to win, events / levels to discover (which you can then choose from the main menu). It won't take you a lot of time to do everything in the game once. It is a great small casual game to kill the time with. I found the controls good enough (use a controller for analog input) and the style very nice.I got it in a bundle with 1$ and I guess it is the perfect price. I would never spend 12 euros on this, but that is personal preference.			"

												Soo this game.... were do i start?If you love drifting, turbo whistles and hooing then this is the game for you.Word of caution though here are a few things i need to mention -NO WHEEL SUPPORT (ps4 and xbox controllers only)-Pretty much unplayble on keyboard -really simple graphics-Top down view only-You either will love the music or hate it (its a mics of Dubstep/Trap/EDM)-JDM only cars-The whole 'map"" is divided into different zones that are locked at first and are unlocked through challeges (note that  untli now i have not experienced any loading screens between these zones since you drive to them) -THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING AND NOT SIMPLE AND YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF DRIFITING ABILITY IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST FUN OUT OF IT.Despite this i love this game its just simple unadulterated drifting and hooing in zones full of tracks and challenges to do.  The game has a nice art style were the map and track are white with a few brightly colored buildings to mix things up and your car is the paintbrush. The game is nicely optimized and I can definitly see someone playing this on an unplugged laptop (Provided you have and controller). The game is just soo fun i can't stress this enough. The game is easy too get into but hard to masterand you willl spend hours trying to get to the top of the leaderboard.  The physics of this game are awesome and you cant just go full throttle into a bend and expect not to spin out this isnt need for speed but this just emphasizes the fact the this game needs wheel support i think i would be much nicer if it did. The game also has a sense of humor in the way it presents itself and its tutorials and the names of the cars, and since it doesnt take itself too seriously and you can just fun with it. So if like turbo whistle and slithering around a bend like your in Tokyo drift this is the game for you.  "

												At first I sucked horribly at drifting at this game. I was spinning out and smashing into everything. But after about 2 hours of playing, I'm really enjoying myslelf. I'm flinging around everywhere (on purpose now. lol).There are many different ""races"" that you can spend a lot of time on perfecting. Heck, I went back and played the oval track for 30 minutes trying to improve my score more and more. And that's only one track! There's also freeroam with some large areas to play around in (and do missions) and a more arena like mode.The physics are spot on, the controls are tight (once you get use to ihem), the music is great, and the art is purely amazing.10/10 game.

												It's... Decent, but it needs a lot of work. I've smacked into a wall several times without losing a drift combo only to lightly brush it later and have it count that as hitting the wall. And how it determines whether you are ""drifting"" seems totally random. I also find it quite odd that, while most drifts I do are not considered drifts, it does count me spinning out as a drift.Also, the handling feels very realistic. While that would normally be a good thing, combining it with a fixed aerial view and no HUD whatsoever makes controlling the cars very confusing and almost impossible.The free roam mode is really the only thing that's fun, and that only lasts a few hours. Not really worth $15.			"

												It's a pretty fun game but unfortunatly relient on a controller. Without incrimental steering, the learning curve for getting good shoots through the ceiling. Had to get a refund.*Edit*After repurchasing the game because yes, I missed it's charm. And spending a good few more hours in-game, I've managed to get top 10% on every single track in all three catagories and managed to finish all levels of free roam on keyboard. I revise my review and give it a thumbs up because while the learning curve is still imence and players using a controller do still have an inherent advantage, After many hours of playing (for such a simple game) I have managed to get a feel for it and do reletively well in the rankings. It's a fun game just don't expect a massive amount of playebility as the free roam is reletively short and once you've finished that it's all just getting better scores and rising in the rankings so if that's your kind of thing then go for it but if you're looking for a casual, easy drifting game with lots of potential playtime then look somewhere else because this game is hard and very competitive.

												Fun, very fun in fact. Worth the money fun? Not sure about that one. The free roam mode is quick to finish (I've done it twice) and it requires close to no skill. However on the flip side, the game has a great visual style, good soundtrack (depends on what music you like), a nice feel to the car (rather easy to enter drift and hard to leave) and finally what extends the life of this game which are the events you can enter which are pretty much drift tracks. Unless you have a drive to finish high on the leaderboards or master a track, this mode won't offer much to you.So in all, perhaps the posetives justify the price tag. It's a great but very short game. If you're interested in the positives above then by all means do buy it. However if you value long games then perhaps this isn't for you.			"

												This game is great, it may be frustrating when starting out because you'll find the car hard to control. However, after a while of playing (or if you have existing knowledge and practice with drifting in games) you quickly get the hang of it. The controls are very sensitive in a way that each movement you make affects your car greatly.The color schemes may not be too striking, but it just adds to the simplicity of the game alongside the amazingly calming (in a way)  and simple soundtracks.

												I like this game. It has very basic polygonal graphics, kind of reminding me of many a mobile title, but combined with a full monitor screen and 360 controller, the subtleties in control far outweigh what any mobile title could easily muster.The scoring in a level works as perhaps expected... score increases as you drift, more quickly when  drifting faster, and each decent drift increases your multiplier; skim close to bollards and you gain bonuses. Driftkhana modes offer objects to donut around and boxed areas to spin in - very Dirt 3 - though ultimately the zoomed out view and lack of detail means Dirt 3 remains the much more varied and interesting game.There's a wonderful flow to this game, that combined with the music, can mean spending ages on the simplest of tracks trying to beat your score.

												Amazing game, was looking for a game like this for ages. As a kid i always played a flash game called ""VanTT"" which is really really fun.Absolute Drift is so fun and I'm really addicted, highly reccomended, on top of that, the soundtrack is amazing and time really passes by when playing.The Xbox One Controller issue was a bit annoying and i didnt end up fixing it, but i just used a PS3 controller instead.:)			"

												AD is a wonderful little gem with an incredible and well-defined aesthetic. It also has a great difficulty curve and length - it took me about 3 hours to feel I truly was 'good' at the game and had it under my control, and about 7 to earn every achievement. You'll know this game is for you if you got excited by the screenshots - the physics engine is just as good.			"

												9/10 for a small game!Great soundtrack, nice selection of cars, and decent variance in gameplay.Leaderboards and ghost cars is cool.The tracks are varied and fun to play onFree roam felt a little bit underutilized. A point system would have been fun I think.I would have liked more decals for the cars too.			"

												This game is great. It has a very high skill ceiling and its a pretty tough game to get into, but once you do it feels fantastic. The music is fantastic, and fits the gameplay like a glove. The graphics are beautiful and simple, which is perfect for this sort of thing. The high score system leaves the game with heaps of replayability, banging your head against the wall again and again to get 30000 extra points. And there are plenty of walls to bang your head into, believe me.There is one gripe I do have though, which is that the Hoonivan is just too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly good to excuse using any other car for going for high scores. For example, on Kobe, Das Whip has a cap of like 4 million possible points on a perfect run while the hoonivan with its ridiculous drifting and cornering ability can get up to 6 or 8. It does kind of irk me that there isnt much downside to the hoonivan; many other cars have something that balances out their strengths (also known as a weakness) but the hoonivan is just good in literally every way.

												This game is none like anything else. Have had so much fun since the update and now I've made top 10 in Driftkhana sapporo. Drawbacks:-something needs to be done to smoothen the camera when moving across the screen. -when you hold down the forward key to start driving after you restart an event, sometimes you'll drive backwars instead of forwards.-there needs to be an easier way to access the settings instead of going all the way back to the title screen.-A more personal opion is to constantly update the music playlist. DON'T remove any songs, but it could use a few more especially if you play the game for long periods of time.I think these things could really enhance the overall gameplay and help calm some fustrated people.Keep up the great work and always keep sliding.-Twin Turbo.

												This has got to be the most artistically beautiful yet physically challenging game I've EVER played. I love every bit of it: the minimalist design, the hard-as-nails gameplay, the sly anime references. Everything about this game oozes with elegance; it's practically a racing game in a ball gown. Definitely check it out!!I've got to add that getting good at this game makes you feel so amazing. When you come really close to a wall in a drift yet manage to pull away from it without ending the drift, you just feel like a drifting master. I've never felt this kind of satisfaction from a game before. Absolutely life changing. Pick it up; it's a must-have! :D			"

												Absolute Drift is a game about drifting.It emphasizes timing, focus, reflex, and a nuanced comprehension of steering and gearshifting mechanics. However, this game does not have any technical stats or car-classes that allow you to tailor a car or course to your style. One engine and suspension type, cosmetic chassis, locked top-down view. The real nitty-gritty aspects of Drift Racing are left out of this simplified expression of the art.Absolute Drift is a game about Zen. Revelations abound as you learn by tooling about in an openworld-style drifting playground, where you are enticed to push your skills and remove the training wheels in exchange for more precision and direct control. This teaches you patience and encourages clear-minded serenity to tackle multiplier challenges and exceptionally long drifts. Letting go, both of your ego and your break, transforms each turn into a slice of transcendent meditation. But there is more to Absolute Drift than letting go.Absolute Drift is a game about drive. The drive to turn each course into a masterpice, one gear-shift at a time. Rather than listed names and a ladder leaderboard, you are given global player percentages, and where you fall in the over all community based on each course and event you complete. More than that, the urge to paint the tarmac with sublime compass-curves and deft switch-back transitions. It motivates you so effortlessly that time and anxiety fade away in the clouds of rubber smoke trailing behind you.It's a good game.			"

												A fun little game with a GREAT soundtrack and a cool minimalist style.The free-roam mode (the ""story""-like mode) is about 90 minutes of play depending on how much you suck. Could probably be speedrun much faster. There's a bunch of drift and driftkhana tracks each with their own leaderboards, so the competitive leaderboard types of players will probably get much more than 90 minutes out of this game. The drift mechanics seem mildly accurate, for a really low-grip world.Unfortunately the goal detection is kinda dodgy. Where you have to do donuts around an object, you actually just have to be drifting a certain angle, not even in the correct direction, within some radius of the object. You'll accidentally half-complete some objectives driving past it. Drifts to complete objectives don't have to be successful, you can slide past, tick off an objective, and then slam into the wall (the exception to this is that actually hitting clipping points doesn't give points, and donking donut objects sometimes resets them). The result of all this is that you can basically fumble your way through the whole game (you do gotta git gud for the leaderboard modes though).Also there's a difficulty setting that seems to do nothing. I don't even know.All up - it's a fun little toy, but it's not really a complete product.			"

												I enjoy Absolute Drift. That's really the bottom line of this review. I enjoy it, but I wish it were longer. The game is, at its core, a top-down arcade-style drift game that reminds me of the Gymkhana bits in DIRT 3. Only this time, there's no ""Go share it on YouTube!"" Absolute Drift is a game that leaves you alone with your car, some blank-faced obstacles, some quiet drum and bass tracks, and tire tracks that follow you into the sky.-----Gameplay: It's a small, relaxing game that's more about you enjoying the driving mechanic than completing any objectives. I beat the game in about 2 hours, but beating the game is really just unlocking all areas to drive around aimlessly. With the recent addition of a sort of difficulty switch, you can make your car handle in a way that's either more challenging or forgiving, but either way it's tremendous fun. 9/10Graphics/Visual Experience: This game is relaxing and the visuals are a big part of that. Being a simple top-down drifting game, there's very little pretending that any of the buildings or bridges are important as anything more than obstacles. Buildings and the ground are left the standard off-white color, while little details elsewhere are given a flourish to bring them a little more life (usually a shade of red). You have the option of 5 cars, each with their own ~5 colors and ~5 decals. The skidmarks follow you into the sky, which at first may seem like a silly detail but I felt it really added something to the game. 9/10Sound: Previously, the sound of squealing tires was a tad too loud but it's been cranked down as of late, meaning the relaxing atmosphere the music creates is far more effective. My only complaint with it is one that's my own fault, which is that despite liking drum and bass music, I tire of it very quickly and it all starts sounding the same. I need to try it while playing with my own music, but I haven't tried that yet. 8/10Replayability: It's one of those games that you have to be ""in the mood"" to play. While it's a fun game, the simplicity of the environment would work more as a strength should the world increase in size a little. In its current iteration, the world feels a little bare. However, should you find yourself liking the world, the gameplay will remain the same every time, and as I said before, ""beating the game"" isn't depriving you of any options or elements but merely recognition that you've unlocked all the parts of the open world. 7/10How it Runs: The game is simple and is about as demanding as you would think. There's not much that's going to tax your computer should you decide to purchase this game.			"

												Absolute Drift is a racing game that's secretly a platformer. Once you wrap your head around how to properly plan and manipulate your drifts, the game becomes about squeezing as many style points out of the various tracks on offer without crashing like a moron. You will feel like a moron when it happens, but you'll also feel like a badass for a near miss.Graphics remind me of Mirror's Edge in all the right ways, and the music is 10/10 for the atmosphere alone.If you're the kind of person to bash your head against a wall until one or the other breaks, you will enjoy this game.

												A nice looking modern take on slicks'n'slides singleplayer. At first, unlocking all cars through the different worlds, is quite boring, but you will get the hang of how to play. The free-roam mode is quite repetitive and does not give anny real challenge, but the fun starts afterwards. Trying to get a better score on different tracks gets addictive. Its easy enough to do a good drift anywhere on any map, but to get a successfull run through a whole track? Thats a whole different story. It helps that restarting a race takes just seconds so you can perfect that first corner drift many times. Rinse and repeat for the next corners too.			"

												Absolute Drift is a fantastic game, with terrific atmosphere, enjoyable gameplay, and a decent framerate even on lesser computers. The game is simple, you drift around the world completing objectives going from section to section. The artstyle reminds me of Mirror's Edge, with a white world with the important areas marked out in an accent, typically red. The soundtrack is pretty solid for the fact that it's a drifting game, it definitely fits the game well. The game controls very well, any time you hit a wall, spin out, or lose a drift for any reason, it is YOUR fault, not the game's. All and all, it's every enjoyable game with a terrific atmosphere, and if you enjoy driving games or drifting, you should definitely give Absolute Drift a shot.			"

												So, it's a game about drifting. If you know how drifting works, just forget what you know for this game. It has such a huge learning curve. With that being said, I love it. It's so much fun to just go in and drive around. I finally completed it along with all the achievements and it's still fun to play. My only complaint is at times you lose the car behind a building or wall which makes it difficult at times to tell what is going on. Other than that, I would say get it if you are interested. I can only see the game getting better from here on.			"

												This game is not easy, no one ever said it was easy, ever. This game perfectly captures the ""hard to play, Harder to master"" style of play. I found myself coming back to this game, playing a bit, and leaving more skillfull then when i started the game up that day. It is not confusing, yet is challenging. It is hard to play, and harder to master. There is racing games with drifting, then there is this...With absolutly nothing...But drifting...			"

Absolute Drift is the epitome of ""easy to learn, but hard to master"". It's real success is that no matter where you are on the learning curve, it's still fun. There is always something to aim for, whether you are a beginner just trying to stay off the walls, or an expert chasing that elusive perfect run.			"

												Really sweet, original, physics based car simulator. The simple artwork is a nice change from more flashy drift-based games, and if you like D&B, this game is probably worth it for the soundtrack alone. Not much new content has been released in the last few months, leading to a bit of stagnation in play time, however, if you get it on sale, you can get at least ~7 hours out of it, and get about a dollar per hour of play time.

Perfect combinationThe Gameplay is a good mix between having a relaxed drift in the free roam mode and having no easy life to master the challenges on the tracks.You can play it pretty good with a keyboard but i recommend a controllerI can definitely recommend this game.(I bought it during a sale for around 8 €)			"

												With my 2.5 mere hours in this game, one would say that I need to play more to rate this game. Unfortunately, 2.5 hours was enough to give it a negative score. Mainly because there are some things you really need to know about before you buy this game.So, Absolute Drift ""Zen Edition""I love the idea behind the game, you drift over a wide variety of different tracks in order to become a Master of Drifting.Ofcourse, you are still a youngster and you need to train to become better. Except, how? There are some tutorials and the always negative tips in loading screens and that's it.For example: I finish a drift course with no tasks done and I get this: ""You are spinning too much, use less throttle.""So, Little Marcus restarts and uses less throttle. But now drifts can't be executed because i'm driving too slow to do one.The game leaves the rest to you. You must find out how much throttle you must use, when you must use the handbrake, when you start a drift, etc.The progression in this game was so lazily made. See those nice tracks or ""Events"" as Absolute Drift calls them up there in those pictures? You don't actually need to do them to progress to the next world as you think you would. That's right, you don't have to enter a SINGLE event to finish this game. You only have to do a certain amount of missions in a world and that's it.Sorry to say, but I only got a max of 30 minutes of entertainment out of this game. Because there is almost nothing to have you keep playing if there is no challenge.Funselektor Labs Inc. and FlippFly. I'm asking you guys to spent that little more time to make this game so much better than it is now because this game is the same as getting thrown into World War 2 with no military training.			"

												a very fun game indeed.  it displays and captures how difficult drifting can actually be if you don't have the finesse to maintain that perfect angle.   the lapped tracks, the downhill runs, the assortment of cars, everything is great.there's even some references to the anime/manga Initial D, a series that helped popularize drifting.-Your starting car is an AE86 Sprinter Trueno GT-Apex, or ""hachiroku"", complete with the iconic ""panda"" paintwork.-the ae86 says ""#TOFU on the bottom.  the protagonist of Initial D, Takumi Fujiwara, delivers tofu for his father, which has helped him develop his technique.-one of the downhill courses is ""Haruna"", which is the real-life version of ""Mt. Akina"" in the anime and manga.if you want to test your drifting skills, this is the game for you.  throw on some eurobeat, put that cup of water in your cupholder, and make those tires squeal!			"

												An true gem, and a great example of low-key development in the ever expanding steam library.As a casual racing fan with an enourmous love for drifting, powersliding, getting sideways etc. this title instantly hooked me with it's appeal to minimalism in favour of gameplay and SFX. At first glance it's easy to dismiss as a 'one and done' kind of game from the newgrounds flashMX era, but before the first song has even finished you'll be stoked to try and push that score a little higher, or make that turn a little smoother. From initial launch to the ZEN edition update, the dev has been recieving (and responding to!) feedback about the game, and it's clear that fans' interests/concerns have been addressed at a steady pace. This is very encouraging, and likewise i think the creator/s know how much we love them <3If you're interested in drifting, racing, smooth electronic+techno, or something to put time into on a rainy day - Look no further.

												Frustrating at first... and then frustrating some more, but in a good way?  Rather than a case of easy to learn hard to master, this slightly fiddly, really quite accurate, drift simulator is tricky throughout.  As someone who sends a fair bit of time sideways in real life, I'd say these guys have made a really good job of capturing that feeling of desperately trying to maintain angle in order to snap the rear back the other way and transition into another drift.The game relies heavily on the desire to achieve that perfect run of 3 laps of well timed transition and big fast sweeping drifts.  Great until you actually manage said run, and then you're left feeling a bit lost as you're unlikely to ever best it, by much at least.A great toy, but requires something a little more in terms of aims/objectives/direction to make it into a truly great game.  If you like your sideways this is definietly worth a look, as long as you are prepared to persevere long enough to glean some satisfaction from neat drifts!			"

												Lots of fun for not lots of money. Psudeo-isometric drifting game that is accessible to the beginner yet offers something for even the most experienced sim racer. This game forgoes the usual lisenced cars, awful bodykits and whiny community trying to organize endurance races for a more simple, beautific approach. A simple set of enviroments, with just enough car choices to make you feel like you have some options, is peppered with obstacles and objectives for you to slide your way around. The only shame is that there isn't more of everything - the few car choices are varied, the enviroments are different, and the original music is great background. If you grind and try to do everything, the whole ""campaign"" and all the achievements will still only take an experienced player ~5 hours or less. A more casual play gets maybe 10 before finishing the campaign and maybe another 3 for the remaining achievements. Also, there's a reason they recommend a controller - it will make your life better. If you want the challenge or more gametime, you can try the keys, but if I were you I'd grab your handy dandy 360 pad you have sitting around.Pros:-Pick up and play-Nice soundtrack-Pretty to look at -You can drift a van, which is pretty sweetCons:-Easy to learn, hard to master, especially if you don't play a lot of driving games. -Short. Like, sit down and play it straight through by accident short.-Limited replayability.			"

												I enjoy Absolute Drift. That's really the bottom line of this review. I enjoy it, but I wish it were longer. The game is, at its core, a top-down arcade-style drift game that reminds me of the Gymkhana bits in DIRT 3. Only this time, there's no ""Go share it on YouTube!"" Absolute Drift is a game that leaves you alone with your car, some blank-faced obstacles, some quiet drum and bass tracks, and tire tracks that follow you into the sky.-----Gameplay: It's a small, relaxing game that's more about you enjoying the driving mechanic than completing any objectives. I beat the game in about 2 hours, but beating the game is really just unlocking all areas to drive around aimlessly. With the recent addition of a sort of difficulty switch, you can make your car handle in a way that's either more challenging or forgiving, but either way it's tremendous fun. 9/10Graphics/Visual Experience: This game is relaxing and the visuals are a big part of that. Being a simple top-down drifting game, there's very little pretending that any of the buildings or bridges are important as anything more than obstacles. Buildings and the ground are left the standard off-white color, while little details elsewhere are given a flourish to bring them a little more life (usually a shade of red). You have the option of 5 cars, each with their own ~5 colors and ~5 decals. The skidmarks follow you into the sky, which at first may seem like a silly detail but I felt it really added something to the game. 9/10Sound: Previously, the sound of squealing tires was a tad too loud but it's been cranked down as of late, meaning the relaxing atmosphere the music creates is far more effective. My only complaint with it is one that's my own fault, which is that despite liking drum and bass music, I tire of it very quickly and it all starts sounding the same. I need to try it while playing with my own music, but I haven't tried that yet. 8/10Replayability: It's one of those games that you have to be ""in the mood"" to play. While it's a fun game, the simplicity of the environment would work more as a strength should the world increase in size a little. In its current iteration, the world feels a little bare. However, should you find yourself liking the world, the gameplay will remain the same every time, and as I said before, ""beating the game"" isn't depriving you of any options or elements but merely recognition that you've unlocked all the parts of the open world. 7/10How it Runs: The game is simple and is about as demanding as you would think. There's not much that's going to tax your computer should you decide to purchase this game.			"

												Absolute Drift is a lot of fun.  Once you get a hang of the controls, you'll be drifting along effortlessly and feel just a little bit like Fujiwara Takumi.The game has 3 modes: Drift Track, Driftkhana, Mountain.  Each presented in a clean, minimal look and feel, which in my mind, enhances your experience since there's no distraction from what this game is about: Drifting.Drift track is simply what is says: a track to drift around.Driftkhana can be said to be a timed playground with boxes to knock over, demarcated areas to spin in, make doughnuts and just in general do as many drift tricks as you can in the set amount of time.Mountain is similar to Drift track, only the ""track"" mimics a mountain downhill where you traverse it from end to finish.The aim in each of the modes: score the as many points as possible.At first this is quite difficult as you get to grips with the car and the handling.  But the controls are forgiving, as are the physics.  Soon you'll learn the limits of the car and the ins and outs of the handling and physics together, throwing the car around like second nature.Furthermore, connecting all of the events, are hub areas (5 in total), each containing between 18 and 25 missions to complete.  Complete all missions in an area to unlock the next.You can also access all of the events from the main menu and jump straight in if you like ( no need to unlock them first ).Absolute drift is great for simply relaxing and pouring out any stress you have into the satisfying act of watching a micro-machine sized car, drift around corners, boxes, containers and trains.Highly recommended.NOTE: Absolute drift is purely a singleplayer experience.  Don't approach if you this is a drift racing game.			"

												This looks like a fun little game! Unfortunately, the controls are not configurable. The pre-defined keys are the arrow keys to control the car. This is very awkward on my laptop keyboard, and causes my fingers to cramp. I much prefer the traditional QAOP layout - but it is not possible to change the mappings. I'll happily come back and give this game a second go if they put in that basic functionality. But until they do, it's unplayable for me.**EDIT** as MOW points out, thi IS available - with a little leg-work! I shall amend the keys and play on.			"

												Overall awesome short game.Everyone that is into drifting should get this game!The minimalistic looks combined with impulsive soundtrack invite you to drift in the small open world.You unlock the different stages of the game by completing challenges like drifting between certain buildings or doing donuts around trees.I'm having a tremendous amount of fun only by doing that and trying to obtain the perfect flow and seeing the smooth lines the tires leave behind. Topping your Highscore in one of the Driftkhanas resemble those in Dirt 3 and ain't any inferior.Each of the 6 differnt cars distinguishes from the others in terms of maneuverability and torque so you can pick the one that suits your skill best. No matter what car you pick you will still have a hard time knowing the point when you have to countersteer or back down on the throttle.But achieving the perfect combination of drifts will reward you with an emotion, that is just as plain and straightforward as the game itself. . . PURE JOY!The content is slim and you can easily finish the game in under one hour.Mastering the arts of drifting will take you much longer and i can only speak of myself but this game was more fun than almost every racing game i played in the last year.

There isn't much to do: you drift around a big map in free roam where you have some challenges to win, events / levels to discover (which you can then choose from the main menu). It won't take you a lot of time to do everything in the game once. It is a great small casual game to kill the time with.

												Great art direction - minimalistic, soft colors, and sharp edges combine into a pleasing visual experience. Tire tracks show your course and how to replicate it (or not). A calming soundtrack is paired with the screaming of your car's engine, which can get a little annoying, but is also consistent enough to drown out with the music.Gameplay is centered around point-based driving, drifting around corners as close as you can, as fast as you can, and as sideways as you can. The gameplay is enticing and draws in perfectionists; I had a lot of good fun honing my times!I've played this on my friend's account with a Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed it for hours. I got this part of the latest Humble Bundle and tried it out with my Xbox One Elite controller. The support for said controller, as well as the Xbox One controller and the Wireless Dongle, is broken. No matter what I do the controller pulls to the left constantly.The fixes for the XONE controller are hit and miss - works for some, doesn't work for others, but they are just workarounds. A game like this needs inherent support for controllers. My DS4 controller did not work either.I'm hesitant to recommend Absolute Drift. I had a lot of fun before I switched to the current generation of controllers. I would avoid this game if you use the current controllers; if you use a 360 controller or use KB/M (I would recommend not to), then you should be fine.EDIT: The developer supplied a beta version of the newest build of the game and it solved my control issues. Now Absolute Drift, once the beta version is pushed to live, is a game worth recommending.			"

Just a heads up, make sure you change the transmission settings to manual.

												This is a racer where times don't matter - sliding cars around corners for points is the core mechanic.If you've ever played a top down or isometric racer before, this one has a great driving model. I've played using a logitech gamepad F510 and the car handles well, giving a sense of balance and yet still requiring care to avoid losing the back end and spinning out. All the cars feel like rear-wheel drive models,  so braking into the corner and burning rubber will float you round the corner. Burn too hard and spin out. Burn not enough and you'll lose your precious multipliers. Finding the balance is key.The roaming mode introduces you to the various driving challenges - loops, point-to-point and gymkhana events (where you drive as many tricks for points in 2 minutes). There is enough variety to keep the interest up - I completed the game in about five hours, so its not huge. However, I still have the urge to improve my scores - there are worldwide leaderboards to compare yourself against. Also the leaderboards show which car was used for the score - its not always the more powerful cars at the top...Recommended if you like driving games.			"

												Very fun game.  I can spend hours on a single track trying to perfect my run.  It's a lot different than your standard driving game but it's very deep and the proposed (free!) update to Zen Edition for Q3 looks amazing.  This will certainly continue eating hours of my life.			"

												Really nice, takes a while to get used to the physics but after you do it, you can pull off some pretty cool drifts, i wish it had more tracks tho.Worked flawlessly for me.			"

												An amazing techno soundtrack that goes perfectly with the sleek graphics and the excitement of nailing awesome drifts. 10 Initials out of D.			"

												This game features 3 level types: A-to-B mountain tracks, freestyle drift courses, and 3-lap race tracks. The free roam map has additional missions you can perform only once, such as donut around a light pole, drift between buildings, jump over a river, etc.I was pretty terrible with the drift controls for most of the game, but finally seemed to start figuring it out near the end. (The controls work just fine; I am just not very good at drifting.) Despite repeatedly crashing into walls, I really enjoyed playing this game. I enjoyed the game even more once I finally figured out how to drive and drift. I particularly loved driving around the map in free roam and discovering new missions to complete. The minimalistic art style and varied environments provides for a beautiful game that keeps you coming back for more.Pros+ Beautiful minimalistic art style+ Many missions to complete+ Large soundtrack with ability to skip tracks whenever you want+ Ramps! Launch your car into the air and spin out of control+ Customizable car body and paint jobs+ Controller supportCons- Not much replayability once you've completed all free-roam missions- Difficult learning curve for controls- Only three types of levels gives feeling of repeating the same thing over and overThe game trailer video perfectly shows a taste of what you'll experience playing this game. If the video makes you even remotely interested, then buy it! "

												A little on the short side but fun nonetheless. The camera angle is a bit weird as in its top down but doesn't rotate with the car. Suppose that's apart of the challenge though. The drifting itself is actually quite good, nice mixure of realistic enough to be worth the effort yet arcady enough to keep it fun.			"
