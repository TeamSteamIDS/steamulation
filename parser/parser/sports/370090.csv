												I am so happy that we have got not only an american football game on pc but that we have devs that are open to any suggestions you make. The game is fun for what it is and the game will be fully moddable in the future just basic mods available now. For now don't expect a full simualtion football game just expect a fun arcade style game in the vein of Tecmo Bowl with an innovative passing feature that can only get better with time. Support this game and lets see it grow.			"

												Alright so, lets all keep in mind this is not a Madden game.With that out of the way, lets begin on what this game currently offers, plans and needs.Keeping it quick and simple:1. Passing is rough, its much easier to run currently as they can basically pick you off quite easily 1 on 1, as you can on defense.2. Running is very fun, however they need to add some of Maddens ideas such as, Hitstick, Stiffarm, Spin and overall more balance towards all running styles Offensive and Defensive.3. The rubberbanding that currently is in-game will I am sure be fixed sooner later, however it really causes some issues when your playing the game, mostly on offensive side however it makes it rough to make plays on defense aswell.4. The AI on passing is amazing, AI QB's are very accurate and this not only causes issues because they can just bomb it everytime if they wanted, they can hit their screens very quickly on the move with 95% accuracy. This should be looked into as it can unbalance the game in serious need-to-win games.5. Fantasy draft and other goodies that are planned to be added would make this game have so much more to offer, I hope they release a huge content patch in August like they have planned as this game has so much potential being one of the only Football games on PC and new.I recommend this game because I am a diehard football fan, however if you easily are butthurt over AI kicking your teams butt, you may want to avoid this game currently and look it up after a year or so of patching.Might have been a little to early release, but we need to support games that we like, specially rare Football ones. :)			"

												First off I would like to say that I think the passing mechanic is the best innovation to the football genre in over a decade. I just wish that the rest of the game was as well fleshed out. Don't get me wrong, I've had fun with the game, but it feels like it should be in early access or a promotional tool to get a kick-stater going and not something being sold as a finished retail product. Also, it's awesome that this game supports Xbox One controllers.For me it just has too many issues to recommend it at $20, which puts it in the same class of competition as games like Rocket League and SuperMega Baseball. But at a discount it is worth checking out but bear in mind it does have a few glitches and bugs here and there.A few of those that I've encountered are: I've had multiple instances of kickoffs out of bounds resulting in touchdowns being awarded to the AI. I've been rewarded touchdowns on successful two point conversion tries. Dropped lateral passes aren't counted as fumbles. There are some ballance issues with certain teams being pretty OP (you can easily run for 1,000 yds a game with Seattle). The A.I. throws far too many interceptions (I've had as many as 12 in a single game) and takes too many sacks (I've had as many as 39 in a single game) on higher difficulty levels.I hate having to give this a negative review. I think this is a great starting point, the dev has some really good ideas, I'd love to see him get a serious backer because with proper resources and a team he could make an amazing game, but this isn't a $20 product. Again if you can get it at a lower price, you should give it a try, just have level headed expectations. This isn't a Madden-killer yet. Maybe in 2016.Here is my detailed review of v 2.0 featuring video footage of the kickoff touchdown glitch. Most of what I say in it still holds true though a few of the gameplay elements such as defensive line shifts have since been patched into the game)

												I'd say it's less ""simulation"" and more ""Tecmo Bowl""... And that's not a bad thing. This is a budget title, and it shows. The graphics, animations, and audio (namely the commentator) are terrible. There is a serious lack of depth, with each game in the franchise mode feeling like random exhibitions. But Axis Football 2015 shows a lot of potential. I dare say that I actually enjoy the passing system in this game over modern day Madden titles.Overall, the game is pretty fun. If it should go on sale for $4 or less, I'd highly recommend checking it out.			"

												I love football and was excited when I saw there was an American football game on Steam. I stopped playing VERY quickly. The play selection is basic at best, the control is stiff and janky, the menus are glitchy on high resolutions, the visual presentation is on-par with games from 2007, and the sound assets are absolutely horrible. There's no crowd noise, no music and the announcer sounds like a 1940s radio announcer with really bad, cheesy lines. The only redeeming quality I can think of for this title is the aimed passing, which is neat. Don't buy this game just because you're jonesing for football like I was.			"

												*Updated* With more play time I have come to realize this game is great for what it is. Didn't experience some of the bugs others have mentioned. Little hard to pass but I've gotten use to it. I actually like the fact I can throw away the ball since I have control. Overall its playable and works for what it is. Yes this game needs a lot of work but with more support it'll get there. Don't buy this and expect a Madden or 2K experience. If you buy it make sure you read the description and see what the devs are planning. They know its not where we want it to be so no need to tell them. RIght now this game has LOTS of potential but needs the support to help it develop and grow.			"

												I was very excited for this game being the first 3d american football game on steam but i was dissapointed. I bought this game thinking it was a buy once and thats it but after asking the dev he says it will be yearly (like madden) the stroe paged metioned new graphics and a franchise mode (dont be fooled this wont be till the 2016 version another 20$) the season mode is terrible and basic and there is only to modes that and a quick game. the physics are terrible and graphics mediocre .If this game was a buy once game i would recommend it because of all the great ideas they have but if you want the better features you will have to wait till the 2016 version comes out (another 20$) i am very disapointed.

												Axis Football is the only american football game on steam. It is created by a small group of developers, and is not a complete game yet. If you are looking for a madden or 2k experience then you may be disappointed. The great thing about this game is that it was made for the pc with the ability to pass with your mouse. The developer is also taking note from the community suggestions. There are already some roster mods for nfl/ncaa teams and more mod support is underway. I would buy this game to support it and see what it can become. Pros+Only pc game on steam+Easy controls dispite the fact passing will be weird at first+Developer is listening to the community+Mods+Teams with wacky names at the start+Nice little community that is starting to growCons-Not finished yet entirely -Animations are a little weird-Graphics are weird (but who really cares?)-Many features to be added.All and all, I would recommend this game to anyone that hates how EA is screwing with madden nowdays and is willing to support this game.

												Ok I’m fully supporting these devs because this is really the only way that we are likely to get a good football sim on the PC.   EA has exclusive deals with NFL and NCAA and will never port to the PC.   MS is trying to make make exclusive deals with 2K so that they can have sports games exclusive to xb1 and MS10.  In addition It looks like MS is trying to start yet again their own distribution network for the PC that will only run on xb1 and MS10.I don’t like this environment where you are being forced to buy a console or upgrade an OS just so you can play games.  If you are like me and don’t like the way this is going then you need to support indie developers like this who are really trying to make a difference.With that said I have played this version and it is rough when compared to titles created by EA and 2K.   Lets face it those guys have massive resources and they get massive support from the console makers as well.   This developer is small with very little recourses and no support from valve which is a shame.   If valve and steam want to continue to remain dominant on the PC platform then they need to be supporting projects like these as much as they can.And If you want a good football sim on the PC then you need to be supporting these guys as well.  Even with limited resources this dev has done an outstanding job with what he has had to work with.   They will have a 2016 version coming out in July and I have seen the improvements they have made.   They are still not where they need or want to be but they are making great progress. If they continue to make the same progress over the next year that they made this past year then they are well on their way to making a really good football sim.I understand that everyone wants it to have NFL and NCAA teams represented in the game.  Well they have that covered in the upcoming version.  The devs have opened this game up to Mod support and modders have already added uniforms, graphics, logos and rosters to match both NFL and NCAA teams.  So day one you will be able to download that content and play with you favorite team.Bottom line I am not affiliated with these devs in any way.  I did not help with the mods and I did not receive any free software nor would I ask or except any free copies.  I simply want everyone that enjoys playing those other games on the consoles to support these guys.   I understand that it may take a few years with the current size of their budget and the size of their dev team.   They need our support if they are going to make this game better please consider buying this version and the 2016 version when it’s released.   You can go to youtube and see the progress they are making.   2 thumbs up to Axis football keep up the good work guys.			"

												Like many reviewers said, this is NOT MADDEN.  It's a solid Indie effort which currently highlights a great aimed passing feature.  Pros:- All 'official' pro cities represented but for obvious copyright reasons, I thought the dev was very clever with each team name.  You will have no trouble identifying each game team's counterpart in the big leagues.- As mentioned before, the aimed passing feature- on easy, the AI is too easy but seemed to get challenging on the harder levelsCons:- On all levels AI needs a little more beefing up.  Have AI adjust to player's preferential play style during the game which would force the player to quit using plays that 'always work'*Rather than list the below items as 'Cons', I understand the game is still being developed so...Needing:- At 1920 x 1080, I feel the status bar gets 'in the way' of the view during the receiving portion of a kickoff or punt return.  A way to alleviate this would be to get dev to move the bar down a little bit.  Have not tried lower resolutions- Color blind features needed - namely for the ground 'target' circles. Being partially color blind myself, I have gotten used to noticing the circle during passing plays but still have a hard time seeing the target circle when about to recv. from a kickoff or punt.- REAL time 4 qtrs of play.  Maybe have a mode where one could do a quick game (the way it's set now) then have a more official mode using the official clock times- Some of the Madden features for being able to throw off blockers - hitstick, etc  Maybe a quick view change once a pass or kick is caught or after a ball is handed off where one could look from the player's POV while running the play after the catch or hand. *OR*- Keep the same view since I get that you want 2 players to be able to share the same screen (friend at a friend's house sort of thing) then maybe slow the game down a little bit.  I think all the AI players noticeably all run around the same speed >> FAST.  Greater variability on each individual AI and player controllered players so that some run faster, some slower.  Some defenders block and pass rush better, some don't.  etc..  By slowing the game down some, a player can read the defense a little more, maybe find the holes to run through.Otherwise it's a FOOTBALL GAME FOR THE PC!  I think it's worth it.  If you're tight with the money, maybe hold out to see what the new 2016 version will be about.  I bought in now because the dev needs to earn a living too, and so I gladly supported his efforts for this 2015 edition and will most likely shell out some more moola for the 2016 version.  I'll become a 'lifer' supporter if I see great improvements in the 2016 version because that's usually a good sign that the dev is in it to win it! "

												Look around do you see any other Football games on Steam? Nope...That's enough to show support and see if this Dev can create a great football game franchise for PC.. The game does need work but the passing is fun. I recommend it for any NFL fan.. It is sort of like an arcade football game right now so just don't expect Madden. This is the very start of an original franchise lower the expectations a little and hope Axis can deliver on their promised features.			"

												Its great to see a football game on PC!!! that being said.. this game has a lot of issues the dev always says will be fixed for their ""2016 version"" instead of updates that need to happen for his current verison.  Things like a kicker easily hitting a 65 yard FG every time for AI or not having 4 quarters for a football game... I love seeing a football game on steam but ""wait til 2016 version"" Is not acceptable from the dev for things that should be included now it has me giving a thumbs down.I would say to not give into their kickstarter for their 2016 edition until they fix the issues plaguing this version.  I will be happy to turn this review into a positive when these core issues are fixed by the devs.  At such an early stage in a franchise it is definately not a good sign they are going the way of EA/Madden with ""wait til next years version for this basic feature"".

They need a little tweaking but its nice to have challenging aiFast paced gameplayMultiplayerI like the passing system definitely different and fun than other football games.I like the teams names.Thought I saw something about being able to or will eventually be moddable. Definitely want to look more into that.Not really cons more of suggestions towards the devsWhen running with the ball it would be nice to be able juke, spin, dive etc.When recieving the ball I would like to be able to switch viewsGraphics are older and could do with some work, but I dont really mind im here for the gameplay!Overall a good experience			"

												Finally, an American Football game finally made it on steam.At the time of writing this, I have only played some quickplay matches against the AI. The AI is pretty good at playing all around, and doesnt seem to be very repetitive as is usually seen in games. This makes playing against the AI actually a pretty good mode because the games are short and can be done inbetween doing other tasks.After I try out the Season mode and the PvP mode, I will update my review accordingly, but if they are anything like the quickplay, then I have high expectations.Overall, it is a very good football game on PC, and I recommend it to those looking for their football fix before the season starts.

												The method of passing in this game is revolutionary and I would love to see more pc football games. However, the rest of the game is essentially broken, and even at the higher difficulties it is still way too easy to work around the computer and get easy victories. I cannot recommend this game, especially at the $15 dollar price point.			"

												Finally an American football game on Steam! And yet, this review, at best, is a neutral review.Don't get me wrong, it can be entertaining! And I dont regret the purchase. And the dev is great! Very friendly, and seems really dedicated to the game. Its just so....lacking. Literally. I'll list the cons first, then the pros, to end the review on a good note!The season mode feels so basic. There is no stats, schedule, nothing. In fact, it feels more like it just randomly generates a matchup to play after each game played. To show what I mean by generating a matchup after each game, this is an experience I had in my season. I was the New England Volunteers( New England Patriots, fyi) and I had to play the New Orleans Crusaders( New Orleans Saints.) I played them as the road team, on, Week 4. On Week 6, I again played the Crusaders, in the Crusaders stadium. The endzones had the Crusaders name in both games. One was played in clear weather, the next in the rain. Next, the playbooks. Ok I love to strategize about football. One thing I love about Madden video games, is to look at the playbooks to see all the different plays, formations, etc. Axis football, instead has a tiny playbook. I counted the plays. Offensively, there is 45 plays, counting Speacial Teams plays. There are 45 defensive plays, counting the special teams, again. Not much variety. The game is broke down into two(2) 5 minute halves. With limited plays, you'll probably use the same play anywhere between 5-20 times A GAME. For me, most second halves are dull. But, hey, thats just me. Just needed to point it out.The Ai needs a whole new overhaul. Really.There isn't probably, a game that you dont eventually know how to defeat and counter the Ai. But this, this Ai is so simple and easy to beat. Even on the hardest setting, I still won and even earned an achievement from it! In this case, it was for the Comeback Kids achievement. Gotta overcome a 21+ halftime deficit. Even on the hardest possible difficulty, I  had to goof off for the first half, just to ensure the Ai was ahead by 21+ points. I won 36-35, even with the clock bugging out, and not stopping when it should have! On another football game, I would've lost. On Axis Football 2015, I dont think its possible for the Ai to win, unless you play horribly, or your team's ratings are lower than the Ai, but thats still winnable.Next the price. For what they're asking for it, this game lacks in. I bought the game during the promo sale, with 10% off. The game is not worth $20. Given the current state its in, 5-7 bucks is its worth at max. Maybe $10 since its the only one on Steam. Bugs abound, but none seem to be game-breaking, thankfully. How many times has the playbook glitched after an interception, or kickoff, showing offensive plays, when Im on defense? Its super annoying. And, the worst case of it struck AFTER 1.4 came out! Most of the second half for me, I was stuck using my Nickel formation, since every other formation showed my offensive playbook. Still won, and not game breaking, but still.I'll now list the few pros:Creative take on the team names.A step up from Backyard football.Good dev, even if experience is a little lacking.Final thoughts.Not a bad game, not a great game. Way too easy, even with the new passing mechanic. The game also lacks way to much in game modes. Not even a practice mode(greatly needed) kicking game is wild, and even the roster modding seems to have gotten off to a rocky start, according to some comments in the community hub.The store page says this is a great alternative to playing Madden. Playing this, it greatly increases my desire to dig out any of my Madden games and play them. Or any of my other football games, for that matter, though none are on the PC and obviously not on Steam.The dev also says hes in this for the long haul. However, its already been noted that next year, Axis Football 2016 will be available for purchase, so its up to you to decide if the long haul means this game, or if whether in a few years Madden will have a rival football game to compete with. Actually, I believe when I saw game play of this game, it was on Axis Football 2014, so it would seem each year equals a new release, with, presumably, more game modes, etc.The achievements are also easy to achieve. My first game with 100% achievements, and I earned them all in 9.0 hours of gameplay exactly, according to Steam.There are plenty of cons, yes. But, I still recommend to at least try it out. If anything, you can learn about the game of football. Or experience a decent dev. Or relive the early days of football video games.  "

												This may be the only football game on steam to date. Is it the greatest? No. Does it provide the basic elements of football? To an extremely basic extent. Does it have local co-op to justify a purchase? Yes, at a price. Is this a game of football you can enjoy for at least a bit? Yes.Axis Football 2015 could have maybe been quite the miniature football game. Though simplistic in nature, the game does provide for an arcade experience. I absolutely love how they made throws possible (even though it is supposed to be done with a keyboard, a game pad works just as well). Holding down ""throw"" will bring up a circle in the middle of the field just above the touch line. This white circle can be moved towards any player you wish. Alternatively, you can press Y to zoom out and see which player is assigned which button (such as RB, B, A etc...). The players catching ability varies and some players will actually fumble the ball if their not on a proper path to catching it. The game play itself is relatively smooth and decent, but it's the specifics where this game lacks. Take tackling for instance, there is no specific button to tackle. You simply run into another individual to take them down. This bothers me the most as the timing of a tackle and where a player makes contact with another players is extremely important. Furthermore, there is no sprint button. I'd like to assume all players run as fast as they can but having that little feature can get anyone out of a tight spot. Another issue : there isn't anyway to incorporate tricks or moves around opponents. Off a kick-off, your player will receive the ball. A second or two later, you'll notice every moves as if it's Play Action Football for the original GameBoy. Instead of spreading out, everyone forms into a cone, then into a line to make their tackle. Sometimes it'll be easy to bypass the entire team while other times you'll have the ENTIRE team chasing you. On defense, you are able to move some of the defensive lines around. On offense, there are ample amount of plays to choose from which are actually quite decent. There is a seasons mode but it is nothing extremely substantial. Some players may find the halves a bit too long. The visuals are not bad but the crowd is horrible. The sound is at best decent and the announcer is okay. Extremely neutral on this topic as some of the yelling from the players is nice. Although, they just end up standing there like pylons with no attitude after a play. The menu may be a bit difficult to navigate at first as the player may have no idea how to. You really need to pay attention to what the screen is telling you as pressing start simply won't stop the game. Although the game does a good knockoff teams of NFL teams, it just doesn't hit the spot when it comes to a proper game of (American) football. This game, more or less, is for someone who would like a football game on their library list and have a bit of a breakaway from traditional gaming. It has it's moments where it will entrap you. Soon enough, you'll be wanting more and Axis simply cannot deliver it.Definitely not worth $17 but on a sale under $5... probably.RATING : 6.1/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C Visuals / User Interface C- Sounds / Music C- Replay-ability C Overall  CScreenShots : My absolute (and probably) only favorite feature in the game Don't get too crazy with your plays and drive the crowd wild Field goals are at best, OK I always choose any play that has to do with a hail mary in any football game "

												Very fun game, simple yet fluent controls, AI impressed me, I did not think it would be as good as it was for an indie game. Customization is very nice and is only supposed to get better with updates, if I had to make a request for though it would be one to be able to edit specific player's stats like speed, catching, throwing whatever, also you can change names, numbers, and races, but you cannot change gender, that may seem like a weird complaint because obviously in the NFL and CFL there are no female players but I think it would be pretty cool if they could add that. Overall though this game is worth it, they have two modes currently, quick match and season both are very fun. There is supposed to be much much more to come and already this game is a blast so I recommend it strongly to anybody out there that has always wanted a PC football game that is not looking at spreadsheets and watching the CPU simulate it			"

Pointless, they will glitch through your line and sack you- painful commentary- only 2 quarters per game?- AI never misses, even on rookie. - No fumble, stiffarm, spin or touchback mechanics.			"

												This is a fun game and worth getting. If you ever played Backyard Football it's in a way like that in that it's sort of an arcade style, but it also has the NFL style mixed in. Pros:-Conrols on PC and Mouse are nice.. It's easy to control. WASD work as well as the arrow keys, and mouse.-Fun to play with an arcade style-Season mode works well so far. It has 32 teams with 8 teams that make the playoffs all in 1 division which is kind of a nice twist. The teams resemble the NFL in that one of my players for example is #24 which resembles Marshawn and runs like him (Seahawks). I'm sure someone will release a mod with all the rosters soon. It's a 12 game season.-Announcer is both good and bad. The announcer can be turned off. It's sort of like the announcer on Backyard Football, but not as good.Cons:I can't get my Dual Action Logitech to work with this yet so far. I downloaded a 360 emulator, but not sure how to get the game to recognize the gamepad.Summary:Buy if you liked Backyard Football, or Madden. This isn't anything close to Madden, but it's fun to play and on the PC. It's a good price, and definitely worth supporting the developers.			"

												The ""unique aimed passing system"" is part of why the game sucks so bad. I just move my mouse cursor to the receiver and he catches it no matter what. Only partial controller support?? Meh not good for a sports game. It needs to be fixed so that it has full controller support. You just cant have a mouse and keyboard sports game. Some people are for that I guess but it ruins the gameplay detrimentally. It's a very crude version a bit better than tecmo football but not nearly even close to madden 98 lol. They have much work to do on this game. The only reason I am not giving it a negative review is because it is the only football game on steam. I appreciate that someone finally did it. It needs to be fixed and designed for controller gameplay. Nobody want's to play a sports game with the mouse. I hope they fix the passing so your not just moving your cursor across the screen pretty silly. Overall I will follow it and hope they improve it.			"

												I may change this as I play a bit more, its not that it is bad, but can't say its good either based on the price. I know its a small indie team that probably worked very hard, but can't ignore the reality. Maybe if they make some simple improvements I can recommend it, other than when on sale. Unsure if they have the resources to do the following, but a thumbs down for now is more likely to be seen too.+Passing is EXCELLENT.+Field goals/kicking are simple but GOOD!+Quick, good and simple playcalling.-No jumping, spin moves to avoid some tackles or diving to make tackles would be nice.-I was right up on a field goal and could do nothing, when I went through the middle unblocked should have a chance to block. Same with onside kick, had it at the VERY bottom of the meter (which takes luck and skill so should get the onside at least often). -Blocking is fairly simple, freezes them, that I understand would tons lots of AI work to change more.-Its a good start but feels more like a ipad game at this time as it is very basic, but some fun can be had. Its on par with the first couple of maddens on sega imo.			"

												This game is far from being a full release game which unfortunatly at the moment is the case for a lot of even AAA games. This is at best an early access pickup, so if you are looking for a well polished football game this is defenetly not for you. It does have potetial and if the developers offer it the attention it needs and are not in it just to make a quick money they can do something interesting with it.Pros:1) The manual aiming of passes is an interesting idea2) I absolutly have to mention the names of the teams which have nothing to do with the NFL teams like the Indianapolis Broncos, Seattle warhawks, Kensas City Indians and the fact that the teams are from the exact US cities is just clearly a coinsidence :)3) It has gamepad support which works fine with my 360 controllerCons:1) Totaly unpolished:- the tackles and player movements are not even close to real- there are a lot of rules missing (holdings, interference etc) - but at least they make fun of that in the commentary- some of the available plays can't be selected for some reason- the menu ui and interacton while in a game is horible- do not expect any cutscenes for replays, gamestarts, etc- very limited commentary - at most 20 different lines2) Graphics with the settings set to maximum is really bad3) Some plays will never get you yards because the players don't react as they should - my wr was realeasing the corner just as my rb was getting there and I got takled 3 consecutive times in the same way4) The aimed pass with a controller will defenetly be hard to get used to5) No options menu and volume contol. I had to lower the volume from the windows mixer.Summary: Buy this game only to support the devs in the hopes they will continue with it and for some fun from time to time. If you are expecting this to be something to rival the madden games this probably will not be that game			"

Nothing like MaddenAxis Football is a 3D American Football Game. Choose from 32 teams and play in either season mode or quick match against AI or local multiplayer.Unlike the few other football games, Axis Football was specifically designed for play on a computer.Pros: Any non-acient PC can handle the game. If you want to check if you can handle the game, go to ""canyourunit.com"".[www.systemrequirementslab.com] 32 different teams dressed in different uniform together with a different logo for optimal variation. Player models have a good response time. Personally I do not watch or enjoy real-life American Football, but even I did enjoy playing the game. Nice passing system, some consider it even better then the Madden titles. It is a good indie game! One of the few football games on PC. Good passing, kicking and field goals.Cons: Unfortunately, you can notice this game is a litlle low-budget.  Player models have odd movement, they move to the sides a lot. Occasionally the players teleport before the kickoff which is a bug which should be fixed. The control is creaky. Horrible sound which makes it less fun to play, there is no crowd noise, no music. Way overpriced, in think this game as it is is worth 4,99€. This would be a better price considering this game still has a lot of work to do. Not balanced, there are a few teams where you can easily beat the AI with. Terrible graphics and animations. AI's always use the same strategy, the player is not motivated to experiment with other strategies. Glitchy graphics on high resolutions. Blocking is too simple and there is no way to avoid tackles or jump.Overall experience:I would recommend Axis Football 2015 for any American Football lover, it's a great game to practice the American Football game. I am aware of the fact that I stated about twice the amount of cons then the amount of pros but there is a 2016 coming out with bugfixes and better user interface.Considering the price I would recommend not to buy this game, but this can change in the future!Rating: I would rate the game ""Axis Football 2015"" a 6.5/10.Want more recommendations?

												I've had an itch for over 15 years that I cannot scratch. An itch to play a decent football game on the PC. When the original Front Page Sports football faded away many years ago, I thought that some other title would carry on the torch. It just didn't happen.Now we have this entry. We are instructed by other reviewers not to compare this to Madden. Unfortunately however this is exactly what this game tries to be, an ""arcady"" twitch game. Since this game cannot compete on this level with the aforementioned game, one would expect other areas to be better developed, but sadly this is not the case. If this game had tried to be more of a Front Office football with graphics, it would have fared much better.There is simply no simulation value to this game whatsoever. There is a ""coach"" mode, but this is simply the same game only you do not control one of the players. Since this game is all about action, this mode makes no sense. The action itself is not very satisfying. Often, players being blocked will just stand there, not moving. You can find the one or two plays that will always work, regardless of how good or bad the team you are playing is. As an example, after 4 games, my team's rushing defence has given up negative yardage. My opponents simply cannot run the ball against my team. However, once in a while they will get off an 80+ pass play since their receivers can always outrun my defenders (again - regardless of how good or bad the opponent team is). So every team you play feels exactly like the previous team you just played, only with a different coat of paint.There's also alot of missing elements from actual football. There are no leagues or divisions. All teams are thrown into the same standings with the top 12 teams going to some sort of post season play. There are no quarters in games, only 2 five minute halves and there is no changing this. Stat enthusiasts will be very dissapointed as there are no league leader displays. While in a game, you can see the stats of your individual players, but outside of a game, all you can do is view team totals.If you want to support one of the only options in PC football, then by all means do so.  I wished I hadn't however. We do have a very large hole in the PC Football genre, but this offering does nothing to scratch that football itch. If I enter a fruit cake into the county fair, and my entry is the only entry in the fruit cake division, of course I'll win the medal, but that doesn't mean it's a good fruitcake. Same can be said of this title.			"

												This is not a very good game.   My most significant complaint is the very poor player controls.  I played with a controller and it was very difficult to move with any precision.  It was nearly impossible to avoid being blocked on defense.  There is no tutorial.  The interface is basic.  Graphics are acceptable for a low budget game, though the camera zooms in at times during plays, making it difficult to see much of the field.  There are no ""bells and whistles"" and it is not a very ""polished"" game.  There is limited announcer voiceover, which becomes repetitive very quickly.  In summary, I would say only play this game if you are aching to play an American football game and can't get hold of a higher quality game.			"

												Strengths-The Passing System is a very unique feature which makes throwing off a perfect pass a lot more satifying than other games of this genre.-The Playbook (offensive and defensive) are extensive enough for casual game play and simple to understand.-It doesn't take up a lot of disk space.-The controls are mostly straight forward and easy to learn.Inhibitors-The defensive controls feel a bit clunky but that is probably down to me as a player rather than the game itself.-The Commentary is a bit repetative.-The game could do with a couple more features but that shouldn't be a problem as Axis have announced a list of additions they want to add to the game including player and team creation aswell as a coach mode.Rating - 7/10 (As it is at the moment)			"

												Don't buy this game expecting to play a game like Madden on PC. This game isn't nearly as good as Madden was years ago.However, with that being said, this is the best American Football game for PC. Like many others have said, the cons do outway the pros, however the Axis dev team is working harder than probably any dev team that small I have seen. Axis Football 2016 is already out, and based on the screenshots alone you can see a mass improvement in graphics, design, and gameplay. If that wasn't enough, the Axis lead dev already posted the features that will be in Axis Football 2017, and they are the features people have been asking for. Plus, it is fairly easy to get 100% achievements in this game (and it has trading cards as well).As for the price, $15 isn't very expensive for a game these days, but you aren't just paying for the game. You are paying to support a developer who is working as hard as he can to make a game more worth 15-20 dollars each year. Though I can only see myself getting around 10 hours of playtime in this game, if I hadn't gotten it for free I would have been willing to pay for it. As my rating for the 2015 version of the game, I'd rate it a solid 7/10. It is not a conventionally ""good"" game, but it is worth that rating for what it is - the only increasingly good American Football game on PC.			"

												It's not as polished nor does it have as many features as a game like Madden.This said the game is quite fun and surprisingly addicting. The game's throwing system is very enjoyable and uses the mouse well. The game is surprisingly challenging, but not over so by any means. The throwing takes some practice to get down.Overall I think the game is a pretty good arcade style football game. It may scratch your itch for an American Football or sports game in general for the pc, like it has mine.			"

												Fun enough, but I was expecting more customization options and a better reflection of how the NFL works. There is no free agency, no progression of players, no progression of the team, and as far as I've seen, no draft mechanic. Fun game, as the passing mechanic is awesome and is the best thing that isn't Madden. That being said, hopefully this series will actually make changes to the game, unlike Madden. If you need some football gameplay on PC, this is your game, but as far as any sort of in-game team/player development, hoping that's coming in updates!			"

												If it goes on sale for like 10 bucks it's totally worth it. The controls are great and it's overall just a lot of fun. The main problem is poor animations and graphics, but obviously that comes with indie territory. It's pretty arcade-y at the time because there doesn't appear to be any fouls and is pretty focused mainly on gameplay. With some money and time this could become the best football game to ever be released on PC.			"

												I've only played a little bit of this game, and yet I can already feel the level of work that the devs at Axis put into this. That being said, the game needs some slight improvement for me to buy next year's version. For starters, even with moddable everything, I feel like the announcer needs more dynamic lines, and less being monotone. Also, maybe add something like Madden's dive, spin, juke, just to make running/tackling slightly better. Still great game.			"

												Pros: first american football game since Madden 08, amazing staff that is very responsive and seems to actually care about their customers. They seem to have a lot of free up-dates with a lot of new features coming to this game. The price isn't too bad for a new game.Cons: The obvious it isn't Madden: graphics are almost Madden 98, you can't do swim moves, a lot of game modes are missing from Madden, However this isn't EA and that is a good thing.So I have played two games on here so far, but thus far I have only compelted one pass (a screeen) out of around 20. However, I have thrown incterceptions around 90% of the time (in Madden I might throw one, maybe two on a bad day per game). Even if my guy is closer and it is really close the defender flys and catches it. If I am extremely lucky my guy will have no defender, the ball will hit him head on and he will just drop it. Another issue is that the kicking mechanic that will go from left to right is way too fast. I have to YET make an extra point.Overall is they made it so passing was actually an option and kicking extra points was a give-me like in real life, and you had a decent shot at field goals I might actually start to enjoy this title. If they do that and add multiplayer (not local), add the mode where you are one player and progress (like in Madden), and release their new models as they say it might actually be a decent game. I honestly think right now it is just a small developer and this is a diamond in the rough. However there seems to me a Joe Montanna 16 football game which is expected to hit PC.Bottom Line: If you have a major itch for american football, and some extra cash and are willing to gamble it on this title being fun (it could be, I can see it) then go for it and support these very friendly and responsive developers. I ""wasted"" my money on the game, but I am still okay with it because I like them. However, for MOST consumers I would stay away and wait for Joe Montanna 16.			"

												I'm going to go ahead and recommend this game in the uhhh... Ummm, I guess ""spirit"" of having more sports games on PC. But this game is, well, rough. That's about the nicest way I can put it.A quick note; I only played single player, and only played with mouse and keyboard.It took a single game to learn the passing mechanics which is far and away the highlight of this game. Using mouse for passing like it does with something as simple as ""short click lob"" and ""long click bullet"" is brilliant. You can lead your receivers and all that fun stuff. It feels great and intuitive. Once I figured it out though, I won my second game 62-14 and unlocked most of the achievements. By the end of this second game I had also figured out how to return kicks for TDs with relative regularity, thoroughly exploit things on defense, and found a kickoff glitch to almost always recover the ball. And this was on the hardest difficulty.Simply put, if you have put any serious time into football console games in your life you will absolutely murderously dominate the computer in this game within a single game. Two max. I'm years and years removed from owning a console and this was never a challenge. There's games of the 8bit and 16bit eras with much more depth and AI than what you'll get here.But there is still some fun to be had if you don't expect anything. Hunting down the achievements got me to week 3 of the season. The names of the players are phenomenal. You'll spot anything from a LB for New England named T.Castle with #54 (Obviously a Blue Mountain State graduate) to A. Silva and a bunch of other MMA names. Ran into a Falkner and Romanov too. The announcing is bad in a good way but then bad again. I had to mute it after a half. None of these things bring any substance to the shallow gameplay but made the experience worthwhile and made me feel like I like the developer. The game feels like something my buddies and I would end up with if any of us had an ounce of talent or knowledge to make a game. It was fun in that regard. If that makes sense.Like I said, this is just a thumbs up in the ""spirit"" of more sports games on PC. I miiight finish out the season just to get the championship achievement but the game really doesn't offer much past a game or two. I feel like there's something here though. Especially the mouse passing. It has great potential. As far as I can tell poking around the forums, the developer is planning a sequel and while I still wouldn't set my sights high or get hopeful in it taking the leaps and bounds it needs... Who knows! This could evolve. It pretty much only has one direction it can go; up! I got it in a bundle but think its worth supporting.End of the day, I've seen worse. Don't expect much. Happy Superbowl Sunday!			"

												-Most important..: This is *not* a simulation; it is an arcade game, where you control the QB /ball carrier on offense, and a key player on defense; each ""half"" is 5 minutes in (more or less) real time.  Moreover, while you can control a player using the direction keys, there are no special moves (e.g. juke, stiff arm, hard tacklee, etc.) a la Madden.---There are no NFL teams, despite marketing to the contrary....I played the 'Green Bay ""IceMen""---On offense, there is limited play selection; without the ability to design routes, the selection is actually rather limited.   There are an impressive number of defense plays available, based on the number of linemen you put up front.---The clock/clock management is a mess (no hurry up, each play takes only a few seconds off the clock,)---since it is an arcade type game, there are waaaaay too many big plays---it's all sacks, interceptions, bombs and long breakaway runs....in one game, my HB had runs of 88, 49 and 38 yards---IN ONE HALF. ---Penalties...: there are none.---Fumbles...:way too few; Interceptions: way too many---Injuries: none  A few other observations:---The graphics are upgradeable, and on my high-end MacPro at maximum resolution, the animations are pretty good---There is a live announcer, although his calls are limited and quickly become repetitive,---There is a 'Season' mode, including single-game elimination Play-offs, but no career mode.---The AI is too easy to beat. There are four difficulty levels; after two ""practice"" games I started an entire season and went 8-1 before getting bored and giving up.---There is local multiplayer support (good) but no online MP (bad) There are so many absent or missing features I would personally consider this an early beta.  To emphasize,the game is strictly  an arcade-y experience---there is no ""coaching mode"" available---and so perhaps some of the missing features mentioned above are less important---but this is no Madden, and given the availability of other, better American football simulations on other platforms I can not recommend the game in its current state.  Bottom line:  the game costs about a third of what EA chareges for each Madden seasonal title, and has about the commensurate level of quality. BTW, for those people who, like me, love American football and have been yearning for a realistic and fun coaching sim. game, the best football game I have ""ever"" played---going back 40+ years to the board-game days of All-Pro Football, Strategy, Scrimmage; through the days of MircoLeague and Playmaker, to NFL Quarterback Club and Blitz; to the modern era and the yearly incarnations of NCAA and Madden---is ""Pro Strategy Football,"" which is (unfortunately) still only available for the iPhone and iPad...if you have never tried it, you owe it to yourself to play it, then bug its devs. to port it to the PC.

												FINALLY an American football game on Steam!  The gameplay is fun, the game is simple (a good thing in my book), and the games are quick enough that you can pop in and play for 15 minutes at a time.  I enjoy the season mode a lot as it is not too complicated.  I also enjoy seeing your combined margin of victory along with your W/L record.  It's an interesting way to sort out ""bubble"" teams at the end of a season.My biggest dislike is that all the teams are NOT equal.  If you want to play as your favourite NFL team (erm, city?), you're out of luck if you don't like Green Bay, Pittsburgh, or a select few others.  Only about 1/4 of the teams are actually playable - the rest are just too difficult to bother with.  I imagine this can be changed a little by modding the rosters, but it's a little silly to be forced to edit your team just to make it a viable option. Overall it's an enjoyable football game with decent AI and fun gameplay.  Yes it's short on features, but it's priced accordingly.  For an arcade football game, you won't be disappointed!			"

I enjoy the season mode a lot as it is not too complicated.  I also enjoy seeing your combined margin of victory along with your W/L record.  It's an interesting way to sort out ""bubble"" teams at the end of a season.My biggest dislike is that all the teams are NOT equal.  If you want to play as your favourite NFL team (erm, city?), you're out of luck if you don't like Green Bay, Pittsburgh, or a select few others.  Only about 1/4 of the teams are actually playable - the rest are just too difficult to bother with.  I imagine this can be changed a little by modding the rosters, but it's a little silly to be forced to edit your team just to make it a viable option. Overall it's an enjoyable football game with decent AI and fun gameplay.  Yes it's short on features, but it's priced accordingly.  For an arcade football game, you won't be disappointed!			"

												I hate to leave a negative review but this is not a good game.  It could be a decent base game for the ambitious developer to build on, but right now it feels far from a finished product in it's current state.  Passes tend to bounce off receiver's heads.  The running game is all or nothing as it seems impossible to break a tackle, could definitely benefit from a spin or juke button.  Pretty easy to rack up 20 or more sacks in a 10 min game(quarters cannot be changed from two 5 minute halves.)  Player speed seems to be too far apart.  I was literally able to run circles around the other team on kick returns like Bo Jackson in Tecmo.  Keep in mind I was playing on all-star, did not try hall of fame difficulty.Now I know this isn't madden but even with really low expectations I was still disappointed.  There's a reason madden took several million and years to get where it is.  Maybe in a couple years this can become a solid game.  Right now it's about as basic a ""football"" game as can be.   The price has dropped to $15 but imo it's still too high.			"

												Let's get the highlights out of the way: it is awesome to have American football back on the PC. The play-calling is pretty good, there are a ton of formations to choose from on offense and defense, and there is an announcer.Unfortunately everything else is bad. Bad animations Awful blocking AI Passing the ball on offense is essentially just luck Defending the pass is essentially just luck Only 5-minute quarters, with a ""1-minute warning"" at the end of each halfAnd that's not even getting into the truly ridiculous, such as spelling nickel defense wrong (""nickle""?) or allowing the kicking team the option of an onside kick, but not allowing the receiving team the option to defend against an onside kick.Great idea to bring American football back to the PC...but if you're interested in this because you want to play American football and the game is relatively cheap now, don't do it. You'd be better off finding a copy of Madden 08.			"

												Axis Football, I was really hyped when I saw an American Football Game on Steam which was non simulation, so I decided to buy this game. I heard this game was built on a 500 dollar budget, the game was very robotic and seemed like it was simply made. I then launched the game and played, it's what I expected basically, no NFL licensed official teams, unis, stadiums etc. But I was shocked on the lack of modes in this game, yes Seasons and Head to Head is nice, but where is the Online and Roster Editing and a place where you can share your mods (ala 2k share) When I first played I noticed the Controller controls were stiff, and the passing with the controller was hell, it is a great feature but just doesn't go with the controller(hard to get used to) The running was another thing, the players just took off, it didn't even look like the center hiked the ball to the qb to hand off to the rb, it was like that animation was skipped, I always noticed how the players ran moving awkwardly, and again stiff. I always have had problems with defenders teleporting to my QB, and On Kick Return there is another player who stands out of bounds (KR2?) The graphics are like Madden 01. It lacks a soundtrack, and most importantly CREATE A PLAYER MODE. The commentary is not very exciting, with it's repetitive lines, and in fact it's very cheesy, but what do we expect from 1 guy producing all of this game. I believe that this game has potential, but definitely should be treated as a beta, not as a finished product. This game is a flop but definitely has some potential to become a big hit on the pc if it fulfills its flaws and the developer puts in some more money into the game. I cannot recommend this game, but I do recommend you keep an eye out for future games. 30/100 but has potential for upcoming games			"

												They leady you to belive that thsi game will have more done to it but thats pure bullpoopie They are alraedy saying oh we will add this and that to the 2016 which you will also have to buy. Theirs also talk of a kick starter program... i dono if its for the 2016 or 2017 version or what ever but most kickstarters you get the game when you donate so why buy this one now?No Fran mode but we will add it to the 2016 game, no mutiplayer oinline but we may add that to the 2016 mode! All you can do is play some head to head matches against the computer. Super Temo Bowl for the Snes had more options  then this game does.It don't look to great which i would be fine with if their was some other game play modes, put a custon team into a fran mode and i would play it even with the low end look and clunky game play. I guess buy it if you wnat to give them $20 for the chance to buy a better game next year but i doubt you will get more then an hour or two out of the game play.			"

The Pro's: It Plays/Looks, pertty good. Lot of different Teams & Cities to choose from. It has a lot  of Options/Plays, you can do on the Field. You can ""Curse"" @ the other Team, with no Penalty :)D You can play, Quick Match or Season.The Con's: There are NO Cheerleaders!. My ""Gameplay"" caused 12 (Hardcore Football Fans) to have a Stroke! The ""Resolution"" is a little Buggy.^I played in (Window Mode, 1176x664) & the UI was cut off. I ""Had to resize"" the Window, mess around with it before I could see the bottom UI. Seems to lack a proper Tutorial, or @ least General Tip's. The lack of ""Cheerleaders"", cause the Home Team to lose!My Score: (6/10)It's a decent game, but for $14.99 it's way too expensive for an Early Access, Greenlight Title. But if they Polished it a bit more, and added some ""Content"" *Cough* Cheerleaders. It would be totally worth it.			"

It is an arcade style football game and I have gotten hours of fun out of it so far. Most importantly, this game is a PC American football game!!! That is something to be excited about in and of itself. With updates and mod support to come, this game will improve greatly and I cannot wait to see where it goes. Buy this game if you would like to support the development team and if you would like a football game in your steam library!			"

												It is cool to see a decent football game on PC. Although the graphics controls and gameplay feel more like Front Page Sports Football from the early 1990's it is still a very good start. Keep bringing the upgrades to improve this promising game. It makes for a nice addition to my library for PC. Of course I could never compare it to the Madden series on console, but man it is cool to be able to play on PC again.			"

												Promising. Let's be honest, it's a simple game at this point and I'm in it as a supporter of a project that could be ""the one"" to dethrone the monopolistic crapfest one day years from now.  It needs a lot of work, and I won't be playing it often until major updates come along.  I love the idea of passing with the mouse, but also would want to do it the old fashioned way as an option.  I can decide at the last moment my guy isn't open but the guy all the way across the field is.  In that case a simple button press would get it done faster.  And of course the qb's stats then determine more about the throw.  I'm sure in the present control scheme you can still easily implement qb stats as how far they can throw, and how accurate it is to my requested location, so it might be the best in the end. Buy it if you want to see where it can go.  Until then I still play NFL 2k5 as the best available option, despite trying the other guy every year only to find it hasn't gotten better.  We need a competitor, and a particular league license isn't necessary, at least for me.  I would gladly be some imaginary team as long as it plays well.			"

												This is the first action (American) football game on PC since Madden 2008.  It has devs that are continuing to support the product after release.  If you're like me and you've checked every summer/fall for a PC football game, then your wait is fianlly at an end.Pros: - Full season mode - The first time I've seen a sports game that is actually playable on m+kb - Modable rosters - Competitive gameplay against the AI - It's a new football game on PC!Cons: - I can't seem to find any season stats in season mode.  I can only assume that it's also missing career stats as well.  That would really help the feel of continuity and give an incentive to keep playing. - The running game is very strong, although I'm not on the hardest difficulty (yet) - The passing game gets some taking used to.  In the long run it's probably more versatile than the Madden style, but at the start it's difficult and wonky.  You will throw a lot of interceptions and baffling incompletions. - The commentator is a total waste. Funny at first, but annoying and you'll turn it off after one game.Personally I feel like the cons are fairly superficial and fixable.  Right now I wholeheartedly reccomend this game if you're looking for a football game on the PC.  It doesn't have every feature of past Madden games, but if you don't support developers like this it will never reach that level, and I doubt you'll ever see another action football game on the PC.

												I really wanted to like this game because for so long I have wanted to play a football game on my PC, but this game feels like its still in alpha. The animations and movement make you think the players are more box colliders than people, and there are barely any tutorials to tell you what the controls are. I would still like to see this game succeed an become popular so the developers can develop it into a game PC players can love, but until then I wont be playing it.			"

I want to be supportive of small developers, but aside from the awesome passing mechanic, the rest of the game is severely lacking.

												The first great computer football game I played, was a PCjr  catridge game called ""Touchdown Football"" by IMAGIC. It had only 6 men per side, but many formations for offense and defense. You could even call an audible. It had a passing feauture also. This game provides a good simulation of  basic football. Once the controls are understood you can implement some fairly sophisticated plays.  I believe his will be a good game franchise going forward.			"

												Haven't played much of the game yet, but fired it up and started a season with the Steelmen.  Played my first game, using my Xbox 360 controller, and almost immediately fell in love with the passing controls (though my first pass awful as I tried to figure out the mechanics).  Haven't explored difficulties etc, but if they scale like I would expect, the four options should give each user the chance to find a zone they're comfortable with.Visually, the is simple.  The stadium is filled with thousands of gray and black shirts, the pink endzone is a bit of an eyesore, and the players are simplistic.  Not that it really matters.  The playcalling interface is similar to something from Madden, and the displays are pretty straightforward.The audio.  Well, I'll give the audio a B for effort.  The end result is something that sounds like you asked you neighbor to come over and do.  It's okay, but a little distracting at first.  However, it's not like you'd expect Grade A sports announcers on an indie title, so I applaud the effort and imagine that the 2016 version will improve greatly.  I wonder if there's public domain audio that could be used for the game, like vintage stuff.  That could be cool.One other gripe with the audio is that on four successive plays I heard the announcer talking about a facemask on the play.  And it happened way, way more than it would in a regular game, much less one time-condensed.  I don't know if it's a scripting thing or whatever, and ultimately it didn't take away from the game, but it sounds liek something that needs to be worked on for the next version.Haven't used but will the modding of rosters, of course.  This is a small thing that adds a lot to a game like this.  Hopefully the next version will allow users to mod the team names and logos as well.  And basically the more opened up for modding and the Workshop, the better.Overall, this is a very solid effort, and has the potential for some great things.  If you enjoy console football, miss playing football on your PC, or just like playing sports games, you can do a lot worse than Axis Football.  Grab a copy and support the effort for better things to come with PC football.			"

The First NFL Game on PC...But Is It Good?As this is the only NFL game where you actually play, it is reasonably fun. There aren't any official teams however they do allow you to modify the teams as you wish so it is possible to create your favourite teams if you are willing to put in the time. The gameplay itself is fairly basic, as it does not allow you to do any special moves such as juke moves or spin moves. However this means that the game leans more to a strategic style of gameplay where the plays you run matter more than the individual control of the player. The graphics aren't anything to be amazed by but they do the job well. The only downside i would say this game has is that the announcer if very monotone and boring, but other than that this is a fantastic starting entry for NFL games with hopefully more to come!			"

												This is a horrible football game.  It takes the worst parts of Madden and then sprinkles its own special flavor of bad on top of it.  I wish game designers would stop trying to copy other games.  Madden is really a poor game and we're stuck with it.  But instead of trying out new concepts and aiming a little lower (think 2D animation) this game attempts to take on the giant using a small rock.  The rock misses the giant and comically bounces back to harmlessly hit the developers of this game square in the head.  There's no reason for anyone to own this game, it's not going to get better than what it currently is - a poorly designed, poorly thoughtout pile of wasted time (and my money).Advice for the developers.  Go back and really THINK about the kind of football game you want to make.  Is a 3D animation similar to Madden really something that market needs right now?  Nope, and you're never going to comepte with them.  So why not make a game based more on strategy and less on graphics?  Why not make a thinking mans game?  Why not develop something that requires less ""throwing it deep"" and more ""let's free the right defensive tackle and run a trap play up the middle because the guy is unblockable and is in our backfield every play anyway!"".Dear developers at large, THIS is what the football genre is missing.  Not more Madden nonsense.			"

												Disappointing. Not worth $20. But if a few things are FIXED, this game would be pretty good.First, the bugs:1) That little white passing target circle (""aimed pass target""), works about 50% of the time. When it doesn't work, the white circle appears STUCK about 10yds down from where ball was snapped. Moving the mouse does NOT move the aiming circle. That needs to be fixed.2) Kickoff the ball to the sideline; if it goes outta bounds, the opposing team gets a TD. That needs to be fixed.3) In 1 of 6 games I played, had to quit and restart due to a looping animated sequence; after opponent was tackled, the opponent player gets up, then falls, then gets up... repeat. It was in a loop. Had to quit and restart.Now for the disapointments:1) The side view isn't a PLAYABLE view. Only for coach mode. That needs to be fixed. Tecmo is played from a SIDE VIEW. If this game is gonna play like Tecmo, can we at least PLAY it in the Tecmo-like SIDE VIEW? 2) More camera angles would be nice. The up-field Madden camera is fine but can we at least lower, raise or even tilt it? (Same for a playable sideline view).3) No defensive audibles. Wow.4) Some wind effects on kicking would be nice.5) AT LEAST have a button for SPIN (offense) and DIVE (offense and defense). Again, like TECMO, all we can to is change player and guide player. That's it! OK, if this is gonna follow the TECMO model, give us a playable SIDELINE view.6) Cannot exit, save and continue a saved game.7) Cannot change difficulty DURING A SEASON. This is really LAME. It took me nearly 3 hours of playing to discover the only realistic way to play this game is to play on the highest level, using one of the better teams. The other easier modes are just too easy. So why not let us change difficulty BEFORE EACH GAME, DURING A SEASON!?8) NO VIEWABLE schedules. WOW....9) No coin toss to determine who kicks and who receives. No big deal but found it strange I can decide to kick or receive every game. 10). Modding; not interested in obtaining special graphical software just so I can mod this game. I guess I need cross my fingers that other people can post their modded files somewhere, that REDO the logos, making these teams look like NFL teams with correct NAMES and LOGOS.That's it for me. Personally, I enjoyed the experience. I'll probably play 1 season and delete this game. Worth $20? Not really. This game plays like TECMO but sadly it's missing a playable TECMO sideline view. I do like the simplicity but nearly ALL the things I mentioned should be SIMPLE things that should've been included in this $20 game. If they get fixed someday, great. But sound like the developer already has a 2016 version in the works. Hard to beleive.. this game isn't even DONE yet. But maybe the 2016 version will be the COMPLETE version I'm hoping for. "

Custom rosters The Bad:The animations are pretty rough, although I know they are going to improve in a patch.I'm not a fan of the way the playbooks work. I would much rather have some NCAAesque menu where you choose how each team plays and has their own playbooks. Maybe they could integrate different offensive styles into the game. So something like this:Offensive Philosophy:Air Raid Run & ShootPro StyleSpread Option (wouldn't it be fun to control the pitch with the mouse? directed pitches? FlexboneMultipleetc.Defensive Philosophy4334425335etc. Then depending on what philosophy you pick you have various plays in the playbooks they represent. Personally I think it's really bland how every team has the same playbook and same plays. Other ways to improve the replayability and popularity would be to be able to affect the rules of the upcoming Franchise mode. Maybe have a pro mode and the college mode (that can be played separately or together) where the way you aquire players changes. Honestly I wouldn't care if the recruiting was robust or not, maybe there could be some way that the rankings from the previous year affect recruiting classes, etc. I know much of this is just wishes and dreams, and I really don't know how the software works so maybe some of what I'm asking isn't realistic, but I think this game has a ton of potential to be the PC football game everybody talks about. Also, would be nice if the season mode recorded stats all year long. Other than all that, let us add our own logos to teams, customize jerseys, etc.			"

												Unfortunately the game is full of bugs. Every down is first down and the A.I. repeatedly passes backward. Forward passes sometimes hang in the air while the A.I. just runs around it as if it weren't there. The game, sad as it may sound, looks more polished than it really is. I wanted this game to be a hidden gem. Instead, it became my first refund.			"

												This reminds me of the old arcade-style games where I'd probably be spending a lot of time in. The last football game I played was on the PS1, which was NFL Gameday 99 and that was a long time ago. Never played Madden since I pretty much stopped buying consoles/console games after that. The game size does remind of me the early 00's where I used to buy it off from the store as a CD and it was the full version altogether. Anyways, on to the game itself. It has plenty of rough edges that can be fixed, I liked the way the ball can be passed but sometimes it certainly doesn't work really well as expected, so I pretty much rush than pass and it works for me in such an environment. The AI can be really challenging especially in close games since it always forces me to an overtime which really puts the pressure to play even better but sometimes I feel like it's not trying at all when it can't chase any further. The teams do remind me of how it was back then in the arcade, renamed teams that represented a city so that the developers will not have to deal with copyright issues. I did notice the team named Atlanta Hawks, it rings the same bell as the actual NBA team but I guess since it is football we can get away with it somehow. The stats are also interesting especially in Season Mode which I've recently started on, at least it does feel like how I watch it on TV.Granted, I have no first-hand knowledge/experience with football especially in my country where it's not really that well-known but on a personal level this sport is interesting and I've always wanted to play a game like this at least on the PC. I think the announcer is really funny, but perhaps a few more sentences can be added since I've pretty much kind of memorized everything he was saying. The crowd does look a bit dead probably because of how they were rendered and maybe a louder crowd would at least hide that. The announcer was talking about the ref...I don't see the ref, or maybe I'm missing something here.Anyone who wants to at play a football game on PC should get this but the caveat here is don't expect too much. This isn't Madden, it's Axis. Was it worth for me? I can say yes, because since I don't really play on consoles so I pretty much spend it here in Steam and this is pretty much the first football game I played ever since 99. Will it be worth it for someone else? Well, that depends. Try it on your own time.  "

												Honestly this game is going to be either a hit or miss with most people. Its made by a very small team of people trying to make a PC alternative to Madden.Personally, I think its very good for what it is. There are however a lot of things to improve on which I hope they did in AF16.The collision detection is quirky. Passing is OK, and Rushing is either you get 1-2 yards or 40+. Whenever you block someone or just touch someone on defense (or on the line on offense) you just kinda lock arms with the other person. Just like glue, your stuck there for about 2-3 seconds. (From what I have seen).All in all its a nice game you just have to get over the quirks and the flaws. 6/10 - Its fine.(P.S. - Pick a team with good stats, or else you wont really have a good time on All-Star or Hall of Fame)			"

I can say yes, because since I don't really play on consoles so I pretty much spend it here in Steam and this is pretty much the first football game I played ever since 99. Will it be worth it for someone else? Well, that depends. Try it on your own time.  "
