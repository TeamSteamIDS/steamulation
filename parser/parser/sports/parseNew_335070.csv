												VRC Pro is an RC simulation game from developer Virtual Racing Industries that is currently available on Steam as well as on the VRC Pro website. VRC Pro gives you access to the world of modern RC cars and racing and provides a method of training for amateurs and veterans of RC racing alike. While it may be intimidating at first VRC Pro is an excellent way to get in to the world of RC motorsport.A word of warning, don't expect this to be an RC racing game because that's not what it is, this is a simulation game and a realistic one at that. Also I'd just like to say I've never really raced RC cars in real life, I used to own some RC cars which I used to drive around but that's about as far as my experience with RC cars goes.+Great graphics+Realistic physics+All of the included cars (15) and all of the included tracks (22) are real+A good variety of different types of car and different types of track+A huge amount of customization options for the cars included as well as the ability to create your own from scratch+Has gamepad support as well as support for real RC controllers (adapter required)+The controls at first seem complex and difficult to use but once you get the hang of them they're great+Great performance+A fixed camera view as well as an up close 'following camera'+There is a practice mode for races, helps to familiarise you with a track before you take part in the main race+Practice cars (AI) are very good +Several different game modes both offline and online+Good amount of people online and I believe it can be played with people who own the non-Steam version also+Provides a good way to enjoy RC racing without having to spend a lot of money on a real RC car+The developer is active on the Steam forums+/-You pretty much have to play this with a controller, personally I'm fine with that but I know a lot of people get annoyed if they can't play with KB&M-You can't pause the game even when playing offline-Some of the tracks seen on the Steam store page aren't included in the Steam version of the game-Not all of the tracks have the option for you to practice or race against AI, kind of annoying if you're like me and only want to play the game offline-It's not very begginer friendly and it only has a very simple tutorialVerdict:8A great way to learn how to race RC cars with realistic physics, great graphics, a fair few cars to drive and a number of tracks to drive them on. If you have any interest in racing RC cars then this is definitely a game you should pick up.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			"

												Lovin this game, so realistic and 100% spot on to the real thing and one of my best games to date. The problem is i decided to buy this game through Steam only to find that all the extra DLC like cars and tracks etc thats on the official VRC Pro website version is its not availible through Steam and once you have brought it through Steam you can no longer buy the extra DLC from the site as it becomes linked to Steam only. Anyone looking to buy this game at the moment and wanting extra DLC i would suggest buying it directly from the official VRC Pro website as you will be able to buy all the extras and addons. I am hoping that all the DLC is going to be availible via steam, so Steam please hurry it up and get all the DLC added, so until then im just gona have to stick with the limited stuff from this steam version at the moment.

												I contacted the developer as it doesn't work with the steam controller as advertised and it can't be played using the keyboard. In response to my issue I received no apology, no help and nothing of any value. The only responses from the developer were insults and condescension. He took my complaint very personally and refused to acknowledge that I had a right to complain, let alone offer any assistance. At the moment the Steam controller doesn't work with this game running on Windows 10. It doesn't do anything, not a single button, stick or pad does anything at all. All my other games work fine. None of this is my problem as the developer has tried to make me believe, if the game doesn't work with the steam controller don't advertise it as such, if you're rude to your customers what do you expect but a bad review? The developer has become complacent (or always was) and doesn't care about his customers...			"

												I've never really played with RC cars before and just started playing VRC with an Xbox 360 controller. Having a lot of fun and wasn't too hard to get the hang of, got the 85% track record achievement fairly quickly, should be able to pick up a bit more pace with more practice. Was surprised just how much there was to car setups on the RC cars, many similar setup options you would expect to make on a real/full size race car.Ran some practice races with AI and just started playing with Time Trials and Race Events. Haven't even gotten into the multi-player races or custom car builds yet and already worth the money to me.			"

												VRC Pro is absolutely fantastic. You can start off with an XBox controller, however to get the full experience, you really need to get a USB interface and hook up your own radio / receiver. I'm getting 125 fps on the controller and the feeling of driving a real RC car is just fantastic. Not only is it great fun, but also a superb training tool for this newbie who is currently building a TLR 22v2 for 17.5T spec racing.			"

Posted: March 26, 2015
												I am very impressed by a game that had been out/in development for so long and the work put into it shows.Pros:-Very realistic-Real cars and tracks-Online races/esport type matches as well as series (haven't touched these yet as my skills are lacking so far but look fun)-Very in-depth custiomization (body, parts, aerodynamics, ride height, shocks, balance, steering, etc...)-Punishes you for bad habits-Can use a real rc controller (need to buy an adapter sold separately)-Has been out/in development for ~14 years, it showsCons:-Slightly misleading info on steam. The videos/pics show some tracks not yet availible in steam version and felt slightly slighted by the fact I thought I would be getting some of the ones in the videos/pics. After reading their forums and the steam forums it seems they are aware of some of these things and are fixing them. The other tracks from what I gathered will be released as a ""deluxe"" dlc. I am dissapointed that $40 did not get get me the ""whole package"" or what I was expecting. HOWEVER this is a SIM and a polished one at that and I completely agree with their asking price (for now).-Will be fixing steam/non steam compatabilty or previous buyer issues. (more forum info)-Wish more tracks were included-Is an older game, ~14 years, other than graphics it really dosen't show, and the graphics are not bad by any means.Conclusion:-Definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in a sim rc experience or anyone who has had an rc car. -DO YOUR RESEARCH on what you will get with steam version/non steam license. Steam version contains more than enough to really enjoy this game I just personally wish there were more tracks included. Everything seems like it will make it's way over to steam and the playerbase will only grow from that.-Asking price is fair.-Use a gamepad at the very least if not a real rc controller (xbox 360 controller worked fine for me)			"

												Having been on this hobby in real life for more than 15 years I can say that this simulator does a good job on implementing real life physics. All the details from tires/oils/link adjustments are here. It's a good way to test setup sheets before putting them into practice in real life.			"

												This is probably one of the best simulator games out of all the simulators on Steam. When i was little i had my own little Nitro Buggy and I would always race it around our street. And i must say, playing this game using that Nitro Buggy that i built in-game felt almost as real as it did in real life, minus the sound effects wich in my opinion, is the only thing that bothered me about this simulator.If you're into RC cars, then i highly recommend this simulator!

												Do NOT waste your time and money on this crap:1. The multiplayer community for this Steam version is completely DEAD. I tried to find an MP match around 10pm EST, but there were only 4 players online, I'm not kidding. Just 4. And according to Steam Charts, the average number of players since Feb 2016 has been about 7. The MP community is DEAD. 2. There have been some players having launch / technical issues with the game. However, the developer has never answered their questions (you can easily find these threads in the discussion forum). Another irresponsible developer who doesn't care about the Steam community anymore (due to poor sales, obviously). Even the developer regards this crap as ABANDONWARE, why should anyone buy it ffs?3. The game automatically turned OFF my anti-virus software when I was playing. It happened twice already and so I'm sure it's another technical issue related to the game.Stay away from this stinky piece of garbage. The MP is completely dead and the developer doesn't care about the Steam community anymore.			"

												I have played a lot of games since the 70's to be honest.  I got involved with RC cars when the first team associated car gold tub car came out a long time ago.  I now race them, build them, work on them, adjust them, spend way too much money on them to be honest.  There is no better tool to get good at racing than VRC pro.   It is just like the real thing without the cursing tuning the engine all the time.  With an additional usb adapter you can use most actual radio transmitter you use at the track which is really incredible.  You can practice.  You can race.  You can practice some more.  Graphics.  Amazing.  Control is amazing.  It is incredibly fun and entertaining in fact I would even say it comes pretty dang close to replacing the real thing because it can be way less frustrating.  It has increased my abilities ten fold I am now the top racer in my local club because I have way more wheel time thanks to this awesome game.  I could not recommend it more.  Not for the weak or timid you will need a decent machine to run it but it is well worth the price of admission the content is amazing.  I can start up I tunes put on a track and set down some epic lap times and not get any gas on me.			"

												I'm a casual racer, serious basher! I recommend this game for any RC hobbyist. If you really want this games full potiental grab the VRC Pro USB adapter. You'll be able to use your favorite Transmitter with the game. You can pick one up at your local hobbyshop or off numerous online RC stores (i.e. AMain, Tower, PM Hobbycraft etc.).			"

Posted: September 18, 2016
												Well, this game is a lot of fun. I don't necessarily consider it a game, though. I consider it a simulator. Something to improve your actual skill. If you are not into RC cars in real life, then this really isn't for you. It can be fun for people who aren't interested in RC cars, but I think there are better games for pure entertainment value. If you are a very serious RC enthusiast, specifically a 1/8 buggy person, then you have to have this simulator. So, that is the perspective that I am going to abide by, someone who is very much enmeshed into the 1/8 buggy off road racing. There is a lot of on road stuff in this game that is very good, but I have paid it no attention.Firstly, you absolutely HAVE TO purchase the adapter for about $19.99. without that usb adapter there is no one you can take it seriously. Secondly, I recommend using or buying the a spare receiver strictly for this game. It is very wise to use the same transmitter that you race with in real life and then adding another model for the sim. Getting or using a second recover is strictly for convince. If you are dong going to play on a laptop or you know that you are willing to take out your existing receiver every time you want to play, then that is fine.Secondly, I highly recommend that you buy the most expensive versions of the game. The ‘lifetime’ or ‘ultimate’ version. No matter what you do, you have to purchase the basic actual game for around $20. Then, you can buy DLC and expansion packs. I recommend buying the lifetime version, because the dutch guy that owns the company is actually working constantly to update, upgrade, and add content. It is very much worth it, in my opinion. All the tracks and buggy packs, ect will work out to more expensive after a few years. This simulator has been around a very long time and it is constantly getting better. Now, for the actual review. The physics are very good. It is not a very demanding game to run at the same time. The tune-ability is extraordinary. My only criticism for nitro is that they engine sounds become for discriminatory. The engine tuning is actually a factor at the most competitive levels. For electric, I would appreciate more variety of hardware to choose from, but then again the fact that they are all essentially equal is a good thing. Like the chassis, they are essentially all the same at the competitive kit level, which is a good thing. Another criticism would be that on the setup sheet they offer you a more clear visitation of what and where you are chaining things.It comes down to your tune, setup, and above all driving skill. Which is great. The competitive levels available are outstanding and I can honestly say there are some guys in this game that are beyond pro drivers from all over the world. I really appreciate the completion. To summarize, invest some money into this simulator and it will turn your real life investments into another realm. If you are running a buggy that, at one point, was worth around a thousand dollars, then spending the total of a new brushless motor combo or a low level nitro engine is more than worth it. What this game offers has honestly improved my driving significantly that would equal probably dozens and dozens of full days worth of driving. I love this simulator and it is such a great thing to exist for the RC hobby.My final tips: Have a dedicated receiver for the adapter. YOU HAVE TO BUY THE ADAPTER. Download and research other peoples set ups. You can download files and then move them over to a file inside the game through your computers file management, then when you open the game they are there. Add all the ‘groups’ and ‘clubs’ that you can, because they host races. If you just race the official races then there is less content, but the official races are the most competitive.Tremendous resource. 10/10			"

Disclaimer : Base game was provided via a review code by the developer. I've spent some considerable time providing feedback and suggestions to said developer, which has resulted in the implementation of the deluxe packs as seen in the DLC section of the store page, his willingness to adapt and provide new ways for players to get involved and experience this game should be seen as a pure positive, and I purchased the deluxe cars pack as a measure of support. Developers who act inclusively should always be supported in such a manner.This isn't your father's RC game, this isn't Re-Volt either...With that out of the way, let's get some misconceptions out of the way, what VRC-Pro is and is not. First off, it's not a casual racing game. This isn't a knockabout toybox racer like say ""Toybox Turbos"" or ""Blazerush"". Whilst VRC-PRO deals with miniature racing cars, it should be treated with the same respect as say Assetto Corsa or DiRT Rally, you will need to either -have- an interest in the subject matter (namely RC car racing) or be willing to learn and take an interest in the hobby to get the most out of this. This is a ""simulator"" as opposed to a normal racing game, except here we're discussing simulating radio controlled cars, and that's a different mindset. It takes a different approach to get used to, but once you get over the learning curve, it's most definitely an entertaining and satisfying experience.A more considered approach to Radio Control cars...The core package provides you with a good slew of tracks, both indoor and out, time trial and practice modes, as well as practice against the AI to get you used to the core concepts, it also provides you with an arsenal of components ranging from spec grade controllers, batteries and motors, all the way through to a selection of bodies that come with their own decals and colour schemes. Critically, all of these components can be fine tuned in much the same way that one can tune a full size car in AC, except now you're dealing in the fractions of millimeters and fractions of degrees, but the principles are very much the same. You'll be adjusting to balance downforce against top speed, working out the best gearing ratio for a given track to optimise for speed versus acceleration, the user interface provides a solid level of information as to what each change will affect, so you're not left in the dark as to what your adjustments will cause. A useful addition is the marker that shows where the original setting -was- before you started tweaking, so you can assess how big a change you're making before you commit. Pitting in track allows you to make some adjustments, but for the full suite you'll need to go outside of the track and take the car apart, that also allows you to change components, and with the deluxe car pack, there's -tons- of options available.Dinky scale, dinky graphics, dinky sounds...The graphics are solid, the track are well appointed, and the cars are suitably detailed, the game runs at a rock steady 60fps and I doubt it's going to tax anything that's been built in the last five years. The only hiccup is the flat textures that represent the people around the edge of the track, but you won't really be paying attention to them when you're trying to set good times.An important note is that the physics engine most -definitely- feels convincing. These machines may be light, but they have grip and traction once they're up to speed, and using something with an analog control (such as an xbox pad) is deemed *critical* if you want any chance of setting decent times. The game supports the full gamut of controllers, and in a full nod to authenticity, even supports RC radio controllers if you order a USB dongle from the VRC PRO site. This allows people who are testing their RC setups to port their configurations into the game, and then test them from the PC environment using their RC controllers with full and immediate feedback, this is an important plus.Sound? It has some. It won't win awards, but it does the job. The music is .. music. I'll be kind and say you can set it to ""off"" if it doesn't flick your switch. Multiplayer is stable and the netcode is reliable, in the tests I ran it didn't hiccup once, and there's a good and solid community that's been running alongside this game for an extended period of time, which is a nice to have. The skill levels range from hobbyist right the way through to high end (as evidenced by the time trial leaderboards), so there's always likely to be a race that suits your tastes.A strong spine, and a solid foundation, much like Asetto Corsa, there's a future here...The one thing it lacks right now is a true Single Player ""Career"" mode of sorts (a la Project CARS), which means that beyond Time Trials and Practice VS the AI, you're going to be reliant on the community and your own enthusiasm for the world of RC simulation as for how much you get out of it. In that sense it's going to be a lot like Assetto Corsa, if you have a love for the subject matter, this is an easy sell. It's a very niche product, but what it does, it does exceptionally well.Verdict : Highly recommended for serious RC fans, and worth wishlisting even if you're not. This is definitely ""one to watch"" "

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS:I had a few fast Traxxxas remote control cars as a kid and this reminds me of it. It seems to have some elements of Trackmania, but much more difficult and sim emphasis over arcade. My biggest issues so far is that due to lack of players, im often just doing time trails racing myself without competition which can get DULL+BLAND!  MP IS DEAD ***SO DEV ADD AI PLEASE*** or may change my thumbs up to a down!!!!This is a game that will take some time getting use to the controls, perspectives (although F2 can give you the car POV rather than a controller on the sidelines). Lots of customization options, but the menus can be a bit annoying or difficult to maneuver at first and lots of content is off limits or expensive DLC. Its challenging, very fast cars on small windy tracks overall which is cool. The physics are good but the gamepad and controls are limited. I do like using the dpad to steer similiar to real life controls but R1/R2 would be good options with braking too. I noticed some cars dont have reverse though requiring the annoying voice and space bar to reset, with no options on the gamepad to do so! Graphics are decent, although the people are cardboard cut outs holograms literally lol, I don't care though. They have a few glictches but nothing big. Load times can be a bit long even on a good pc and connection. Now all we need is a robot wars game where you craft your own machine, i guess that is twisted metal lol.  With a few fixes (controls and add AI to races) and if DLC is more affordable its a solid niche game for fans of the sim racing genre. I recommend when its on sale for casuals as myself. I got the Offroad Tracks #2 DLC with 5 extra and bigger tracks for 10% off so $9 which suggest checking out. I can tell they put ample effort into ths game.			"

												Picked up the game on steam sale, with the all inclusive pack. All inclusive would be great if they had a selection... But it's very lacking. SC Trucks are very popular now in RC and they have one to chose from... ONE. You get to drive a 4x4 Associated in team or RTR version. Don't like that? Don't run SC then...Picked it up for the sole reason of practicing and having a little fun on the road with the lap top.Graphics. Not bad, at first glance, but they way they line you up against the track is always some odd way, never actually straight up against it, the zoom levels are terrible trying to set up something useable. Either way to close when it comes near the podium so you can't see anything around it or to far so you can't tell propper orientation when on the far end of the track. Follow mode helps for a walk around sort of thing to see what the track actually looks like, but also makes the track seem very ""2D drawing"" looking. You can't change controler settings or camera zoom settings (you can set over all zoom, or one of 3 different cameras) while actually in game so you can see the results. Instead you have to load in and out constantly to try and make these adjustments. Almost all of my game time was spent doing so. Colors to take to wheel color changes, accessories show up then dissapear from the list when trying to out fit your vehicle and the list of them is very short even when they do all show up. Body customization is very very limited, when changing shock positions they list numbers on a sheet.. but if you don't own the truck and know where these holes are then you are shooting blind making changes. Game jumps and glitches about, check my profile for system specs.. No reason a game like this should have a issue running on my set up, Witcher 3 doesn't at 4k  but this one at 1920x1080 has problems... Maybe in the future but not worth it even on sale as it is. My oppinion, maybe not yours. If it ran better, didn't have options that failed to apply, had more realistic visuals for angles (seems like only under truck shadows, no sides) so you could tell better it's angle where it was pointing, had the vehicals I was looking for and equipment I wanted to use then I would be more interested. It does not.All the negative above in consideration... The physics seem pretty good... Might spend another 13 and get the adaptor... Still trying to give this thing a shot so you may see my play time increasing for a bit. Hoping in the future they add some 1:10 buggies, and some 2wd SC trucks.			"

												Pros:Good simulator that works quite well as a game.Cons:It might be nice to see more vehicles, but not at the expense of detail.Comments:This may not be for someone who wants just to add another racing game to their library and lacks understanding of what is what in R/C. If you are willing to learn this is a great game to help do that since there is so much detail.I have a history where I was really into electric R/C racing for a few years (10+ years ago). This is my re-introduction to the sport since I do not have easy access to supplies to get back into the hobby. I think to appreciate this game you need to go into it with the mentality that this is a simulator first and foremost, not a game. Thus, I can imagine that tweaking the many parameters for each unique vehicle and component must be a monumental task. Therefore I take my prior R/C training experience an apply it here: I only used to race stock class for the time I spent in the hobby. Why? Because the general skills that are transferrable from class to class do not depend on having the exact setup that you have. If you have a faster motor to begin with you will just spend all day crashing and not having a good time without understanding why. Stock or Spec classes let you get the feel for how you should be driving while making it more approachable. I am again only tinkering around in spec class until I get really comfortable with the Spec classes using lower power motors since you can learn how to handle the car (or SC truck in my case) for the specific track. Once you can race stock class very confidently then moving up to the hotter motors can make sense. This games makes it so that faster does not equal better. A good driver with a stock setup can do quite well against someone who is not such a good driver using the fastest and best setup. As it stands I am mainly playing in the electric short course 1/10 scale class, so I am not too familiar with nitro or road racing. I have tried nitro, and it is an unfamiliar beast for me. I have tried road and I do not have any interest in the class.Without some sort of controller or game pad the game is not worth getting. I am using an XBox 360 controller which is quite nice, I hope to get the USB adaptor to try using an actual radio transmitter soon. Make sure to calibrate the dead zone since the controls are much less forgiving than in other games.Edit: I now have had the USB adaptor and use it with a Spektrum SR210 reciever. This requires cutting some of the plastic on the USBs plug to get rid of a corner so that it will plug into the SR210. It works great and I highly reccomend this.			"

												Updated Review, Thumbs Up (28 Aug 15):In short, I used to take issue with the long-standing fact that not all content was available to owners of the Steam release of VRC-Pro, and that the various platforms were not at parity with one another.  That issue has now been largely resolved, in the form of an all-inclusive DLC which unlocks everything for the life of the product.  The full package doesn't come cheap, but I feel the asking price isn't unreasonable considering the niche market, licensed content, and comparitive pricing of other simulation dlc (e.g. DCS World, The Pinball Arcade, etc.)  In every other regard, I continue to feel that VRC-Pro achieves its aim of providing a realistic simulation of and training tool for rc motorsports.  So the devs have delivered, and fair is fair - I would now recommend VRC-Pro to all rc enthusiasts, including those who prefer Steam as their gaming platform of choice.Original Review, Thumbs Down (18 June 2015):I would like to rate VRC Pro positively - I really would.  But I can't at this moment in time, and I'll elaborate as to why, with the hope that I can change this rating in the future.  Do you see the 15th of June (2015) update posted here on Steam with a video of offroad track ""Psycho Nitro Blast 6""?  You can't race that track if you own VRC Pro on Steam rather than the Freemium/Subscription version.  Or many, many others.  Also, you can't access a number of performance parts that top race winners are using.  Even if you buy all the Steam DLC, there is a heap of content that is not offered to you.  It's been this way for awhile now.  You can have fun, as well as high-performing RC cars, with what is on offer in Steam VRC version... BUT... there's a glass ceiling built into this version, which means it is just not-at-all on a par with the Freemium version. I find it really grating to be left behind after I've shelled out ~£30 plus the cost of a real RC controller and usb adaptor.  Some users will point out how inexpensive this is compared to a real RC car and track time...surely I should be thankful that I *only* paid £30 for a handful of cars and tracks? By that logic, racing a Ferrari around the Nordschliefe in Assetto Corsa or flying an A-10 Warthog in DCS World should me cost thousands of pounds for the experience!  After all, I *would* probably be a better IRL A-10 pilot if I mastered the DCS version, no? In the virtual, PC software world, however, £30 is the price of a quality full-release title, sim or otherwise, and I'm not pleased that the Steam release of this title is a second-rate citizen.  And yes, I will pay for good DLC - but the developer has to actually offer it up for sale first!How is VRC Pro as a an RC simulator, then?  Well, credit-where-it's-due, it's pretty impressive.  The physics are realistic, as far as I can tell, and it does feel quite a lot like I remember of driving my high-performance nitro RC vehicles some 10+ years ago.  The graphics are good enough to suit the purpose, though the camera can take some fiddling around with to make it feel right.  I play it stretched across 3 monitors, and find that to be a really nice option if you have such a setup.  Overall, I could easily feel more positive about VRC Pro if all existing versions of it were at parity with each other.  If you think you can be happy having a decent collection of cars to bash around a decent collection of tracks, and aren't necessarily wanting to access more than is bundled here, whilst being teased with new-release videos of the sweet new tracks accessible only to the Freemium version players, then, by all means, give this one a go.  Otherwise, perhaps it's just best to skip this version and decide if you'd be better served by just going straight to the Freemium version.			"

												I'm only a few hours in and I am highly impressed. At first it was a bit tricky to pick up but after I played with the control configurations a few times, I found a comfortable way to play it. That being said, it is still a very hard game but that is awesome because you don't need your balls cupped for every game you play.			"

												This game is really cool. I remember, as a kid I would play RC cars with my dad. We had quite a little collection. When I first started this game I was a little skeptical, but once I started racing all the memories flooded back. It really feels exactly like the real thing. It's amazing. And then I did a few rounds with some of the more professional cars that I never got around to racing myself as a kid (although I would look at them for hours). Wow. And so many customization options. Next thing I'm going to do is hook up my old RC controller. Then it'll really be like the real thing. I can't wait for the devs to start releasing the DLC!			"

												This is an awesome game, i have never driven a RC car before in real life. So i didn't really know what to expect, i love car games. And this is so authentic, first race online and i cruised to the checkers! Racing on here feels very realistic, i could feel the pressure from my opponents. As they tried to diminish my 30 second lead, hahah. But as usual i am always insanely quick on racing games. Their are tons of customization options, along with plenty of tourney modes to choose from. Even if your not an RC fan like *myself* it's still worth picking up, because it's heeps of fun!! I can say this is one of the funnest car games to date! A must buy if you love cars! expecially RC cars ""Not like myself though"" Can't say i would ever consider one of these in real life, i think i'll pass on that one lol			"

												This game looks amazing and runs smoothly. Those are the only 2 good things about it though. I race RC in real life, so I have to say I am very dissapointed with the camera settings. The camera doesn't move fast enough and if centered, you lose view of your car on some corners. Adjusting the camera settings to any config doesn't help. Another annoying thing about the camera is it moves/switches POV mid track. The game should be played from the perspective of the Driver, not some floating camera that moves. switches around and hides your car. I am using a Logitech game controller, and have to also say that if it wern't for the camera being so bad, I would love the controls, and hernce, love the game. I do not reccomend this game, it is a waste of money. On top of that they are getting people to subscribe for ""VIP"" access. $$$. What a complete waste of dough. Do yourself a favor, don't get this game, but DO go get a real RC car and race at a real track. This game is horrible because of the camera, what a shame.			"

												If you're not a fan of R/C cars, you probably won't like this title. When I first started on this simulator, I didn't have the adapter to use my transmitter with it, so I was using a gamepad. Although there are some people within the VRC community who use a gamepad (and are pretty good with them...) I found it extremely difficult to control and to me, it just didn't feel right. Everything about the simulation is pretty much spot on with how it is in real life, aside from the occasional glitches that are to be expected with any software, One of the things I like about this title is, when you crash your car (and you will crash...I still crash...a lot), you don't have to worry about breaking anything. That's good because R/C car parts can get expensive.			"

												It's an RC simulator and there aren't really any other games doing what this one tries to do. You get access to various scales of RCs, offroad and onroad, gas and nitro. Hell, you can even build your RC from the ground up and choose all the various parts from licensed manufacturers. I would view it mostly as a training tool / pure simulator. You enter events and are trying to get the best times on the leaderboards and compete against other players' ghosts. You can have collisions on or off but there are no AI bots in this game. It's a great game for what it is as long as you research it a bit and know what it's trying to be.REVIEW:

If you are a newbie like me and you hoped to give the game a go with the XBOX One controller, then you should probably give it a miss. The controls will not bind to an XBOX one controller and the default XBOX one bindings make the game almost unplayable. I asked for a refund. However, I have since been informed that a PlayStation controller can work if you are willing to use Universal Joystick Remapper.

												More of a simulator than a game, the amount of detailed customization options and technical terminoloy being presented to someone who is not familiar with the sport of RC car racing was a little imtimidating. However, it isn't too terribly difficult to get started with it and it really became a lot of fun once I got the hang of it. It does a decent job of explaining what configuration settings do what for the car do. I've found it's been fun and interesting to learn what all there is to the world of RC racing. I think this is a good game / simulator for both newbies like me and of course good for people who actually know what they're doing. I would say it was a bit difficult at first to play, but after enough practice and getting the hang of it, I've gotten a lot better and have been enjoying it a good bit.			"

												If you like RC, you should absolutly try that sim and it's a chance to have the feeling of racing on off road  tracks if you have absolutly no one in your area like me. The physics are incredible. Graphics are also awsome but some assets could be updated like some 2d sprites. I play more of thhat than Pcars.I hate that people are giving bad reviews because they don't know what they are doing or are stupid enough to buy the steam controller which looks like the worst thing ever. It's not because it's a Steam version that it needs to support that controller. Also, the Xbox 360 and xBox one controllers are working fine and you can easily map the axis that you want like the triggers for accel and brake. That game is also intended to be used with a RC controller and a Sim USB adapter. Million time better.			"

												This game is awesome if you are into RC. If you are a gamer who plays keyboard games and have no intention of using a real rc controller to play the game leave this one off your list. It has great physics of real handling of rc cars in a race format. The setup options are great for new and advanced  rc racers because it explains what every adjustment you are making does. I love using this as a great practice tool and all the race events are excellent. Once again this is no ""need for speed"" type game. It is for rc enthusiast or beginning racers. Another great point with this game is you can learn the aspects of racing without the intimidation of being at a track. (most real life tracks are not to intimidating but their are those snobs at some lol). The only drawback I would say is just the lack of 2wd off road cars and trucks.  Now get out their and get racing!			"

I've played with keyboard and gamepad, TLDR: Get a gamepad. I got one for $11 off of amazon and it works beautifully. The price of $45 is a little steep especially since DLC's are $10 a pop and there's about 6 of them. Once this game goes on sale, snap it up as fast as you can.			"

												Very realistic simulator, something I will be using to get back in practice with rc racing, two small issues to note, however, the software seems to crash on me regularly, which makes altering any car/track settings a chore.The next thing to note, is that I STRONGLY recommend using this with a BIG screen, or you won't be able to get the proper feel of the sim or see what you're doing.The cars are VERY sensitive and FAST, just like the real thing, so anyone who uses this sim is in for a realistic challenge, and it is a REAL challenge.

												Awesome simulator, don't expect a normal racing game, this is an RC simulator. Very nice physics, very very nice customization and setup. I also really like the USB transmitter support, looking forward to upgrade from my Xbox 360 controller. Overall: if you're interested in RC at all, get this simulator and start training!			"

												... love it. used to race a .21 buggy. this game has lot of customization.... but one part of making cars in life, is to change out parts like a-arms chassis parts braces wheels rims wings bodies. the do have a few motors and wheels/tires. but  should b able to choose if u want aluminum parts or rpm or stock plastic.  all these things play a huge part in ur real life car so u should b able todo so on the game.... but past that the game is about as close to really driving a rc as iv ever been.  overall great game. dlc a lil expensive.  lots of tracks and different types of cars lots of online events changing all the time.  i would recomend it to anyone who wants to rip[ rc's without paying all the little payments for broken parts and fuel... all i could ask for in this gameis couple things like, crawlers they are fun in real life. more selection of brand name cars.... like traxxas,hpi, team durango, axial, rpm, integy, rc4wd, and the ability to swap parts from a-arms to wing mounts, minimal customization on the cars... but i still say its the best way to race without having to go out and do it in person			"

												Best Rc game out there(hell the only one thats even close to realistic).Great gamebeen playing the f2p version for awhile now bought the steam version so much better then f2pmain thing trucks are actually customizable in this version can change everything from upper arm position,length,how many holes are in the shock piston, spring weight,preload, etc.there is a few people complaining about the lack of interchangable springs, Its called look harder... they are there just have to look. (on the car setup page there is a button that says ""setup sheet"" or something close to that click it..)but all in all the 40$ pack on steam is a good deal, considering it would cost around $20k+ togo to all the tracks and have all the chassis,parts in this game(hell all the cars would cost around $10k or so all brand new in real life) "

												From the first time I saw this game on Steam it was apparent to me that the intention of the developer was to train RC racing pros. The information in this post is news to me, but it's also not a surprise. For anyone who has put their due time into a hobby (like RC racing) you know how expensive it can get.As a casual player who isn't interested in making RC racing my hobby yet I'm still interested in playing around with some of it's allure, I think the price tag is reasonable.

												So with the few hours I got into this game I had my doubts I liked the Serious Revolt I know its not the same company that made the game but however they are pretty similar. Graphics are good online play seems to work and somewhat active people come and go. I only had 1 random crash because I hit my spacebar to hard or something the game crashed but quickly loaded back up. Fun game if you like RC cars and Racing. Has an ingame chat for online play and lets you play single player online ""practice"". ProsFunEnjoyable to play with othersSomewhat realisticGood GraphicsVery few crashesConsEngines on the RC Cars can get rather annoying the high pitch sound they make but they do sound close to that in real life.Not alot of people play online anymore for some reason I have rarely experinced any issue playing onlineGame crashed when hitting the spacebar to flip the car back over but so far only happened once.Well this is what I experinced in the few hours I have logged into the game so far I will continue playing until I get bored lol.  Still a fun game even with the very little ammount of people playing not sure why that is dispute with developers or people just got sick of racing games I dunno.			"

The UI is horrible, the menues are unintuitive, the tutorial doesn't explain anything other than basic driving controls, the game is poorly optimised and takes ages to load. It is nearly unplayable without a controller (the game's description doesn't mention this), and lastly, the part selection for buggies (the thing I was looking most forward to driving) is not very extensive.Luckily, I had only played for 1.5 hours, so I was able to get a refund.

												I would recomend this simulator (WARNING:THIS IS NOT A GAME) if you are at least able to use a game pad with it, preferably with a Dualshock 4 and the Input Mapper driver, so that you can fine tune the properties of the analogue sticks/triggers.  In fact, the game will even let you use your actual RC controller with the aid of a USB adapter (sold seperately).  I used to drive these things when I was a kid, which was a long time ago, so I cant really speak to how acurate of a simulation it is but it definitely feels ""right"" to me from what I can remember.  Most importantly, I am having a lot of fun with it.			"

												the game is really fun. helps with getting to know some vehicles better. but i really wish there could be monster trucks and rock crawlers and other vehicles of the sort. mostly because those are the types of vehicles i have and would like to get better with those types of setups.  especially because the game is called virtual RC PRO, one would expect to see rock crawlers, monster trucks, truggies, 1/5 petrol buggies. more than one version of drift car. or atleast more bodies to choose from. there are tos of options when picking vehicles, but  they are all the same vehicle with differant color schemes. i really am not happy with the options given. not really worth the money for the dlc.  overall i am happy with the game. i do however think i over paid for the game and expansion packs. 60 bucks for everything would have been a better deal instead of the 110 i paid.
