												One thing to note this is my opinion and this is a game from the guys who made ride and in the end that got little to no support, go ahead look it up on steam.Kind of an introduction to bike games for me but as far as i see it, a fitting one. Things to note+Pros>Large selection of bikes >Beautiful courses >Fantastic physics >Great history +Cons>Somewhat choppy(Framerate issue, it might be just me but if not i'm sure this will be fixed soon)>Character models (lacking diversity in clothes,faces and everything in between)And that is it fantastic game for any Ducati and bike racing fan alike, offers extensive history on Ducati and a rich selection to choose from. solid 8.5/10			"

												Polished Ride game. Could have been sold as expanstion or nor, price is very good for the content. (Ïf you don't like Ducatis there is no point, maybe) The historic bikes sound good, look good... and vibrate :-DTracks are also polished a bit. ""Historical"" Milestone ""style"": Interface is basic: you have no time to read text about the bike on loading screen (SSD drive here... not a console :-)All oponents have same number plate and dress the same..Online is same basic amateur interface. Why not use Steam/Halflife interface?But again: it is great fun and instructional once the flag goes down :-)PD: I wonder if ""Wales"" track is somehow realistic. ""Stelvio"" (been there trice) is a pastiche, and it is in ITALIA. A shame! Historical tracks like old Assen, old Le Mans, Monjuich etc would be EPIC! "

												Its a Good Game, Good Content for the Money....As mentioned by others Its RIDE the game tweeked a bit just with Ducati bikes and pretty simple progress system, Enjoyable to play.So if you like this Devs bike games MotoGP and Ride you will enjoy this.My only main gripe is they had no imagination for skins, eg. you start off in early era bikes and when doing a single model race every rider has SAME skin same gear same helmet...this get boring very quickly. ( you cant change gear helmets designs and so on like Ride)Apart from that the title run fine looks good ( MAX SETTINGS) handles fine so same ol from these Developers.Think of it as a stand alone addon for Ride and you set still good value, pick it up on sale as i did			"

												This is basically a improved Ride game using only Ducati bikes, less content but also cheaper, and since milestone is the only developer that make games around bikes with good gameplay and physics for PC, is a must for any bike lovers, the only thing I can really point out is the lack of improvement in the computer AI.They reuse some Ride tracks but still enough content for its price, and the possibility to drive some iconic bikes even just in virtual reality, is just fun and the history and evolution of Ducati is just a bonus.

												Do not recommend, it is lackluster with plenty of camera bugs. Even though it is essentially just a standalone expansion of RIDE, performance is horribly bad and stutters a lot, even on computers that used to play RIDE perfectly well.Audio is dead silent, no soundtracks during races. Bikes not exactly modeled the best.To see more about what the game actually looks like you can refer to my review video here :

												Let's review this work that seems to have all Milestone fans up in arms about Ducati 90th!Let's address some complaints.-I get it, to others it doesn't feel like a full game.-Bikes are lacking.-Tracks are lacking.(I don't understand this one!)These are the main issues I see, so before I start this review I wanna say this, keep an open mind.From what I know, Milestone had a contract with Ducati for this game, and I feel like they did what they needed.Now the review.It's a barebones version of RIDE, but to say it's just RIDE all together, or a RIDE Expansion sold off as an exclusive DLC is just stupid.The game has had several tracks worked on from France, Wales had a fix to make the track feel more immersive in its hills in the game which lead to flat out speed and aggression with full control. Imola was thought out again and doesn't feel as tiny as the Imola in RIDE, it definitely has the length I expect from it now.And if you know the series well enough you can find the other differences for yourself.Bikes, the count came out to about 36.Sure, we can work with this is DLC.Camera bugs have been fixed since the release, and everything seems to be working fine.All together I think the people who want to bully the game really don't have many valid points.The game as of its fix is flowing a lot more smoothly, and if you love RIDE I suggest you grab this when it goes on sale, yes! On SALE.It's a great game, and I can say I enjoy my time on it, I plan on keeping it as a game I go back to for the sake of playing with old classics, & Ducati exclusive bikes. Personally, I feel it was only right to put all the classic bikes together in one game until Milestone can think of something like a RIDE Classic Edition or something else that addresses other bikes from the past.Do I truly think the game is worth it, or am I just trying to sell you to increase sales for Milestone as they're a smaller company?I do! I think this game has its own place in the world of Moto Games. But I see where people get upset at something like this being linked in as its own title, BUT! That price tag says it all.What are the things I actually enjoy and think others would too?The tracks are remastered, surely not replica tracks though, we might not ever see a track that's an exact spitting image of any IRL tracks, that's why it's nice to have devs who think out of the box to bring unique things to tracks.The bikes yet being a small list still give you something to mess around with. And something I didn't touch on much, the slip boxes are bigger in this game, so any newbie can easily find it to be enjoyable.Even though the list is small I can see Milestone tossing in a DLC Pack or two to try and increase the games lack of bikes.All together I love the feel and for anyone who doubts on it, give it a go before you judge it based on others reviews. It isn't the ""Full Package!"", it's simply something to say congrats to Ducati.Leave it at that.You'll enjoy it if you're a true fan of RIDE, and you won't be too let down. But don't expect big things, just enjoy it for what it's worth. A few new tracks, a list of tracks that have been changed a small bit, a nice compact bike list, and a game that'll satisfy you for a small bit of time.			"

												Feels unfinished; the first race in Historic Tour, all the bikes and riders look exactly the same right down to the racing number, suit and helmet. It's a clone race as you can see from some of the trailers and screenshots in the store page. Tutorial also lacking in voice over which is present in previous Milestone racing titles. No wow factor intro video either. All signs of unfinished work or budget or time constraints.

Graphics wise looks good and plays smoothly even though my laptop doesn't meet the minimum spec. Music is as cool as in Ride just different which is good. Ride has better content and its replays are more interesting to watch than clone races.

Only get when discounted 'coz it's non-essential; just a niche collection of bikes for fans, collectors or history buffs. Recommended only for bike fans or those who prefer a mix of street and track races. 6/10Why in the world do we have clone races? If this was real how to determine who is in what bike? GPS and RFID? These sort of clone races are also present in Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends but not all of them are clone races. I suppose it's the same here too. It's just so bland to watch, quite underwhelming actually. The worst aspect of it; all the same numbers. At least make the numbers different. Look at Project CARS Pagani Edition; different models different liveries and it's free!

In DUCATI 90th Anniversary you get mostly quantity over quality. Yep 6/10 only, mediocre effort.Still recommended though 'coz it's the only one with antique models.			"

Desmosedici GP15 Andrea Dovizioso)- 13 tracks (with mostly 2 different layouts) (Ride: 15),  Miami and Saltlake is missing and instead of Milano you get Misano- Historic Career,  you start with the 50`s beginnings and unlock newer bikes with winning medals   thats the interessting part, to ride nice, old bikes too, get infos about their history and progress in the ages,  if you already own Ride its just a big Ducati DLC,  if you doesn`t its a historic, less expensive alternative- Cons:  !!!  weird  laggs !!!  while constant high fps, ruin the whole game  ( if they fix it, i change to  positive)    -all AI riders look the same  edit 28. juli:  not a single update since release			"

												More or less an expansion of the original Ride game, if you enjoyed the first game you'll enjoy this one too. You get 39 bikes, 10 or so of them also appear in the original Ride game, so veterans get around 29 truly new bikes. In terms of DLCs and Expansions for racing games, getting 29 new bikes for €20 is a very good deal.The main reason to get this new game is for all the Ducati bikes, designed in detail and with unique sound and handling. The tracks are taken from the main Ride game, so nothing new on this front. The AI is really good and the game runs well on my PC.They have tweaked the user interface to be more efficient to use than in the orginal Ride game. You have a Career mode that will take you dozens of hours to get through. It is a very challenging game, where you need to learn the tracks and adjust your bike's settings if you race on Medium and above.My only complaint about the game is the same as with the Ride game; I wish the physics was more sim-like, closer to Milestone's MotoGP and SBK games. It would have added another dimension to the game.If you are a fan of Ducati or a true fan of bike games in general, this is a fun game to play.			"

												As the owner of a 2015 Ducati Monster that I ride HARD (10k miles in the last year), this sim was of particular interest to me.  I put it off until it hit -40% on sale though.  Certainly worth it at this price.Track and bike physics seem to be very good with lots of options.  Coming off Grand Theft Auto 5 where the bikes have fantastic (if unrealistic) handling, I was a bit surprised when a bike would actually slide out from under me when taking a corner too fast (as it should!).It's a real treat to race these historic bikes from the 50's on up to modern times.  The bikes seem to be modeled very accurately too.  Nice how they each get their own history synopsis.I love how the old bikes handle as you would expect.  Not being able to take a corner like a newer bike does is frustrating but very real.  I'm very excited to work my way through all these great bikes and finally take the one I own out on those tracks.One gripe is that the bikes do not feel very 'planted' on the track - visually.  They almost seem to float an inch above the ground.  Partially because the bikes do not seem to pivot side-to-side on the bottom radius of the tires (as you lean), but look to pivot at about a distance half way up to the axle - giving it a kind of pendulum swing as you lean the bike.  A bit distracting when in third person.  I chalk it up to the age and limitation of the engine.The other gripe is that all the bikes in a race look exactly like the one you're on.  All the riders look exactly like you look.  Would it have been too much trouble to mix up the colors and outfits a bit?Most of the review complaints here are based on this being more of a DLC to Ride than a stand-alone game.  A legitimate issue, but you don't have to buy it, so don't down vote the game because you think you should have gotten this as a free DLC.Wrap-up: You're never going to get a realistic feeling from a racing sim on a console or PC as compared to the bike I hop on every day, but for the money, I have no real complaints here and it's a thrill to ride all the historic Ducatis.  If you like to race or ride hard and love Ducatis, definitely grab this (especially when on sale).			"
