												I enjoy playing golf. I enjoy various golf variants, from ""Calvin ball golf"" to ""Improvised course golf"" to simple and pitching around the yard. I enjoy computer golf, dating back to old Dos games with polygons so sharp you could cut yourself on them all the way up to various iterations of PGA games and even an old NES Mario golf game that I had back in the day.I also enjoy management games, because I'm boring like that. I've played various manager games from stock market sims to football, hand egg, and baseball managers.I do not enjoy this game, however. It's clunky, local coop is even clunkier, there's no feedback on what impact the items/employees/housing/car/training/what-have-you actually makes on your character and their play style (I'd like to pretend they matter, but after 2 hours I'm still not seeing any consistent changes anywhere), and the golf ""minigame"", such as it is, is a joke without a punchline.The minigame first off suffers from the fact that it's so forgettable that you can actually skip over it without realizing it. Just click the 'sim the day' button one too many times and you've skipped right over it. Next up, local multiplayer is a pain in the tuckus. The game makes no effort to help you find your characters, so you'll be sifting through a million names to find the ones that you actually made. Once you're actually into the game it becomes a bit of a buggy and poorly made affair. The game seems to pick your default club based on random chance rather than what would actually be useful for an approach, if you don't designate where the ball is supposed to go then it's pot luck whether you even shoot it in the right direction (regardless of your stats(!) and even with the wind turned off), and the 'triclick' function (the bit where you could have any real skill involved) is completely unusable on my computer. It zips along at a million miles per hour, and there's no way to click it accurately because of that. I think this game was made for much older computers than my fairly dated and lack luster gaming rig.The game suffers from a few other bugs as well, most notably in having some items incorrectly priced. Save your game before you go shopping, because there's no undo button and it will happily let you go tens of thousands of dollars into debt.In summary, if this were a $2 game or even a $5 game I'd recommend it only for management fans. At $20, I recommend not buying it unless it's in a bundle. Even then, there's better games that work better, look better, and are infinitely more enjoyable. If the minigame looks fun then I'd recommend looking for some freeware golf games, as there's several out there that look the same and play better.			"

												I'm glad I got this in a cheap bundle, about as much fun as watching paint dry..nope, paint is far more interesting they drying time varies and there are many colours..maybe thats a good topic for the dev's next attempt.			"

												It certainly doesn't have fancy graphics, nor very complex gameplay, but it's a simple game to play if you have the time and a passing interest.			"

												Pile of crap. Game plays in Windowed mode only, must have DPI set to 100% or else formatting makes the game unplayable. So, I had to log out of Windows to change that setting just to play this crap. Gameplay is just as awful. Start a new game in challenge mode and you get ""potential"" points to assing to all of your stats to see how good your golfer could get over time, guess what, you get to set every single stat to 100 potential. Current points do force you to start as a semi-pro, but the sky is the limit. Beginner money lets you buy the best clubs and balls making the numerous other options look silly. Want to watch your golfer play a round using the stats you've built up? Too bad, you have to control your golfer so some of your stats and your caddy's stats aren't that important unless you sim it without watching. Just found out the game's website has a free demo, try that first. You'll get a similar result, uninstalling this game, but with a much lower level of regret.			"

												Not the casual golf game you're looking for. Most of the game is just managing details like the diet of the golfer and other mostly useless stuff. I actually thought that aspect would be interesting but everything falls apart when you actually hit the golf course. Driving is predictable and somewhat boring, and the short game... the short game is where you realize the game sucks. Prepare for 4-5 shots per hole to get used to the clunky putting interface, where every shot will stop one inch from the hole (every time). You'd think that was easily fixable right? not really. There is no grade, roll, slope, or any other features to any green. They are just flat spheres. This game just glosses over the most interesting parts of actual golf. There was more to not like about this game but.. I've put it out of my mind. I recommend you put this game out of your mind, too. Thankfully it was a few cents in a bundle but my time wasted playing it, hoping finally for a good casual golf game on steam was a disappointment. The community manager is a dbag and they pretend to 'pass concerns along to the devs' but it's clear they don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this project any more. Do not buy.			"

												This is a simulation of an actual golf career. You can either choose to simulate everything or play the tournaments yourself.When just simulating the career it feels a bit to passive. All you really do then is assuring you get a good balance between practice, tournament and resting and once in a while check if better caddies and coaches are available. That's about it really.If you do decide to play, be aware that you just watch the holes from above without even the possibility to zoom in in any useable fashion. You can choose to either use a traditional 3-click swing or you can choose not to hit and let it be hit by the computer for you (so called 1-click). If you choose to 3-click it was very easy to win the tournaments by a dozen or more shots. But for some reason there seem to be a bug in the gauge speed so if you log in another time to play the gauge speed might be 5 times faster than before making it impossible to play with 3-click. That is obviously annoying. Another annoying aspect is the putting. As mentioned you can only view the game from above and the slopes on the greens are only indicated by some vague arrows (that doesn't really seem to be accurate) or by listening to the caddy advice (which usually doesn't say anything useful). Chip shots around the green sometime hit at 45 degree angle from where you where actually aiming without the game telling you why it did it.The putting is so flawed and uncontrollable it almost alone ruin the entire game. It is one thing to have putting being hard (most golf sims suffer from putting being to easy), I in fact like when putting is hard. But in this game it's hard for the wrong reason. It's hard simply because you have no clue how the green actually look like. They should probably had been better off to make the putting 100% automated as the interface doesn't allow for any useable way of assasing a putt.Another annoying aspect is that you cannot cancel your shot selection or for that matter change club or aim (when you press either normal swing, over swing or soft swing). That makes no sense at all as you haven't even started the actual swing when doing that.The 1-click format is probably the most natural solution for this game as the game simply doesn't have the mechanics or interface to make 3-click logical. 1-click can be very interesting in theory as it makes the game all about course management and reading the holes. But when you are not really well introduced to what can go wrong, when it can go wrong and why it can go wrong, it sort of feels like you are not in control anyway and it often seems like you miss fairways more when hitting with a Hybrid or iron then when hitting a driver, which makes the risk/reward aspect skewed.This again makes you want to simply simulate the rounds, but that as earlier mentioned makes the game to simple and passive...It's OK to not be in total control of every outcome if you are being told why, but this game doesn't do that. In fact most golf games suffer from the problem of making the game to predictable and to dependant on simply good timing the swing making them more of a ""timing skill based"" game which is an insult to the game of golf. But this game had the potential to change that , but I cannot recommend anyone spending money on this game at the moment, even if you are a vivid golf fan that likes the course managemant (like I do).

												Not great. I suppose if you put the time in you might get something out of it, but this game feels more 1994 than 2014EDIT - As an avid Football Manager, the features and interactivity of the sim seem limited. The interface is unintuitive, and not pretty to look at. I put a bit more time into it (still less than an hour) but it just seems to make life difficult for itself.I love the idea but the execution doesnt do anything for me, and the price seems far to high for the limited interface. Maybe worth £5, but not £15 IMHO			"

												I really love the idea and concept of the game.  It is very in depth and just my type of stat/spreadsheet game.  After playing it for 2 rounds I was having a good time but was trying to put my finger on just why I wasnt having a great time.  I hope the devs read this because I think it would be an easy but game changing fix.  It comes down to the shot meter.  I feel disconected from the result of my 3 clicks.  If i could have more control over it I would be in love with this game.What does that mean exactly?  I'll try to explain:1.  When using the 3 click method If I want more power Id like to just let the meter go into a ""max"" area on the bar instead of having to click overpower.  2. If i want a safe shot I want to just click the meter earlier instead of clicking safe.3.  This goes for putting as well.  I dont feel like I have a connection with the result.  Add some sort of target on the putting meter that can at least increase my make % or make me feel I had somethign to do with making or missing after 3 clicks.4.  After clicking in the power area be it a safer shot or a more powerful shot, if the last click target got bigger or smaller depending on how much power I gave the shot; that would really feel rewarding if I nailed a perfect shot or just played it safe and had  a big area to click in.Hope that makes sense, it does in my head but short of drawing a picture thats what I got.  If the shot meter got reworked I would no doubt fall in love with this game.Dev's great job on 95% of this game, but that last little touch with the meter left me wanting more...Please fix as I would love to love this game.
