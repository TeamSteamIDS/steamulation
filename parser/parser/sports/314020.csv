												The gameplay isn't terribly memorable. It's basically a hidden object game with some light puzzle solving elements. Ah, but the art and the atmosphere! The vibrant, lush artwork is worth the price of admission on its own. This must be what the jungle looks like after a cup of Ayahuasca.			"

												I played through the whole game, but I can't really recommend it. It was maybe 2 hours or so long, but I spent most of that time feeling frustrated and unrewarded. It is a very simple point-and-click game, only they somehow made the controls of a point-and-click game frustrating - you have to hold down your click to move, and the bug would frequently start spinning around when they'd reach a certain point along the path, and you have to figure out where you can click to get him moving again.The hidden object part of the game is incredibly simple, and also somewhat frustrating - I know you're going to make me collect the floating orange balls, but I can't do so until I slowly move across several screens to find the thing that is going to need them. Lots of backtracking for no reason. No real rhyme or reason as to why doing a given gathering task ended with the results it did. I also wasn't really sure the game ended, until I saw that I had all of the achievements. The music is excellent, the art is nice, but in the end - I got the game on a huge sale, and only spent 2 hours playing it, and I wish I hadn't done so. Credit to the creators for trying something different, but it didn't work for me.			"

												Morphopolis is a game about bugs, some of the smallest creatures in the world and they are rather fascinating and very important to our environment aswell. This game is a point and click game with puzzles to solve and hidden objects to discover and find, this will help the small bug on its journey of life. This is a very pretty and colourful game, and not very difficult to play.Also you must complete each chapter, if you decide to stop halfway through you will have to start from the beginning of that chapter, as there is no exit feature while in a level so I just completed them and exited the game afterwards.Morphopolis is a very short game and the achievements are easy to earn. I found the last puzzle rather challenging, but I managed to solve it and get 100% achievements :)I have enjoyed my time playing with the bugs and admiring the lovely art and colours, thankyou for this lovely gift. ;D			"

												MORPHOPOLIS is a gorgeous-looking, casual slow-burn puzzler fueled by hidden object elements; one that I recommend with the caveat that it will certainly not be for everyone.  While not brutally difficult, it is a sometimes frustrating experience that it is well-suited for the casual puzzle and artistic game fan.   There is little direction; and the lack of the ability to save while in the middle of one of MORPHOPOLIS' five beautiful segments is rough, as the inherent beauty of this game is it's calm, wickedly slow movement and it's mesmerizing artwork.  So failing to finish a segment during a sitting results in the dreaded do-over, with your ever-morphing insect ponderously revisiting the beautiful yet limited screens.  That said, the episodes are fairly short, and the game can be finished in a short span (as short as 90 minutes), with all achievements.  But there is the rub; this is not a game you speed through; it is one you savor.  And for someone like myself who's immersion is often limited to nights and weekends by work exhaustion or time constraints, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the various trials of our weary bug, as a calming cool down for the brain if you will... Though the puzzles vary from fairly difficult to rather simple, puzzle veterans may have a leg up on recognizing what it is you are supposed to actually do.  There is zero direction... but hit the discussion board for the concept, and off you go.  Only other minor fret was that in some cases, the hidden object items you are required to collect are quite difficult to discern and at times don't really resemble what you need to find; and I am not hot on clicking randomly as a strategy.  Still, for what it is, MORPHOPOLIS succeeds in being an engrossing, beautiful, casual, albeit short experience that is worth a go if you want to step away from the bullet hell for a moment.  If you enjoy it for what it is, you are bound to be rewarded with a fun little puzzler that is certainly like no other... "

												I bought this game because it was on sale (95% off) and has cards and achievements.  Never really expecting anything else from it.  But when I played the game, I knew I found a hidden gem.Morphopolis is a point & click, hidden object, and puzzle game set in a colorful insect world.   I love the atmosphere!  The art is gorgeous and the music helps to bring out more of the supposedly ""nature"" setting.   The game is divided into five short segments.  You can finish the whole game in 2 to 4 hours.  Basically, you need to guide the insect to find the objects and solve the puzzles needed to get through to the next metamorphic phase.  The hidden objects are fairly easy to find.  There are some that blend well with the background (but there'a a hint button anyway if you're feeling lazy to really search for them).  The puzzles are moderately challenging  (I find the last puzzle a bit more challenging than the rest.).  In some puzzles (like the glow worm, perhaps), I think you'll spend more time figuring out what to do than solving them. :DIf you are a card collector and an achievement hunter, this one's for you.  Only five cards to collect and you can unlock every achievement as you finish the game.The only cons I found are:(1) the lack of direction / instruction.  When I began the game, I only saw a ""hand"" symbol that tells me to move my insect to that direction.  And that's it.  But you can easily figure out the game mechanics as you progress.(2) you cannot save / quit in the middle of the segments.You can force quit the game but your progress won't be saved.  You have to redo everything in that particular level.Do I recommend this game? YES!  For me, I find the good points of this game outweigh these cons.			"

												Nice as an art gallery, but awful as a game.The bugs move reeeeaally slowly. I know how fast bugs move in real life. I have seen them. Why do they move so slowly here? There's no reason other than to draw out the gameplay way longer than it needs to be.The game isn't very good at letting you know what you can and can't do. The only way to move is to hold your mouse down in the direction you want to go, but you can only go along preset paths, and some of the screens are in places that don't even look like paths and feel like you'd only ever find them on accident.It's basically a glorified hidden object game, except everything is so vibrant that the stuff you have to pick out doesn't tend to stand out enough. There were a few instances where I wasn't even sure what exactly I was looking for. The minigames are generally alright, though there's two that are abnormally challenging compared to the rest of the game. The flower bud puzzle especially, which is painful both because of the puzzle itself and the fiddly controls.It's very short. 5 small ""levels"". No real connecting story except that you play as the creature you helped in the previous level, and at the end you open a door and then the screen just fades out. Abrupt.The game looks very pretty and sounds pretty nice too, I'll give it that, but it's slow and frustrating for what should be a relaxing experience, and not worth the money for what little gameplay is given to the player.

												Verdict: Take a peek at the posted screenshots to enjoy the hand drawn art if that is what drew you to this, no need to buy and play the game for that. The 'game', as implemented, is an exercise in frustration.Positive:- Cute hand drawn graphics.- It's different, stands out in used art and 'delivery' of the puzzles.- At 95% off, really cheap.Negative:- Total lack of graphics/sound/control settings (why do people keep doing this for PC games?)- Zero instructions, tutorial or guidance, so just click around and watch what happens and see if you can figure out what the devs were thinking at the time.- 5 levels total, with 1-4 hidden object puzzles each, some of which have additional puzzles after. Again, zero instructions so just click stuff and maybe you'll see something happen that will give you a clue about what's expected of you.- Level puzzles are spread out over several screens, so you have to make your bug crawl around, with regular backtracking required. Excruciatingly slow method of scrolling between level screens, and no way to speed it up.- There is not even a hint at what paths your bug can even take. No arrows, no clearly different coloured or constructed pathways, nothing. Just click the screen edges at different spots and wait to see how far the bug will crawl and maybe by the time it gets there it'll scroll the screen and hey, now you know. Or click a different spot and wait some more.- No save/load options. It will remember a level as fully finished, but leaving a level unfinished forces you to restart all the puzzles you already solved on that level.- Even with all that, it's an extremely short game. I fully finished it in under 3 hours, of which almost half was spent just clicking randomly and most of the other half waiting for the bugs to crawl to scroll the screen, and only a fraction actually doing any puzzle solving.I can understand trying to do things different from all the others. I can understand trying to be artsy. I can understand trying to minimize user interface and controls.But for the love of all that is good and right in PC gaming, please never let any of that prevent you from implementing the required basics:- PC's are not a standard environment, and PC users are used to having pretty detailed control. A settings dialog allowing to change graphics/sound/controls is a must on the PC platform.- Some basic instructions about controls, method and goal of the game. Random clicking to see what happens is not 'learning to play', it's just plain annoying.- Save/load/checkpoint mechanics, especially in a game that makes one waste a lot of time just getting around on a level.Sorry, but even at pennies, I can't recommend this as a game. Cute art style though, so check out the screenshots.			"

												Morphopolis may be one of the most beautiful games I've played this year, but its remarkable looks aren’t always backed up by strong puzzle design. Taking on the role of a caterpillar as it undergoes five metamorphoses into ever larger insects, you’ll find hidden objects and solve puzzling minigames across more than a dozen scenes — each as lusciously detailed as the last — all backed by a stellar soundtrack amidst a bare-bones interface.Feeling somewhat like Machinarium meets The Tiny Bang Story, Morphopolis has you walking your insect between scenes. Each location holds one or more obstacles that can only be overcome after you collect all the objects it’s missing. Sometimes that leads to the obstacle simply moving out of the way; other times, you must complete a minigame or puzzle. Most of these are fairly straightforward, though trial and error is necessary as there’s no guidance, and a few prove confounding, especially given the limited feedback on offer. Astounding presentation and imaginative world designs are what set Morphopolis apart. Each scene is akin to a painting come to life, hand-illustrated in gorgeous watercolor hues and pencil-sketch precision, and the world seems to grow and alter in perspective as your parasitic critter inhabits larger hosts. All the while, multi-layered and earthy ambient music sets a laid-back tone that perfectly suits the dawdling pace and relaxing mechanics of the adventure.The problem is that it’s set back by puzzles that alternate between overly simplistic and too opaque, encouraging experimentation without providing enough feedback with which to gauge how your interactions affect the system. Morphopolis ultimately relies too strongly on its looks to get by with a relatively weak design.The astonishing illustrations, excellent soundtrack, and delightful world of Morphopolis may be worth the price of admission alone in what is an otherwise middling hidden-object game.

Basic InformationTitle:  MorphopolisDeveloper:  Dan Walters and Ceri WilliamsPublisher:  Dan WaltersGenre:  Puzzle point ‘n clickGeneral ImpressionMorphopolis surprised me with its elegant simplicity. It’s obviously, an indie game but one which really stands out with its almost psychedelic visual style and color palette. The game feels different with, metamorphosis being the focal point of a storyline filled with puzzles and hidden objects that await discovery. It is sadly far too short and relatively easy to complete. The lack of any replay value is offset however, by the more than decent price tag and the inclusion of both Achivements and Trading Cards.Strong Points+ Superb hand-drawn artworks.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Short and too easy.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Morphopolis is a gorgeous P&C game bringing you through the life of a bug that morphs into other forms as it completes its journey. Where that journey goes exactly, is not really known, but you will point and click your way through several beautifully designed levels, finding hidden objects to unlock puzzles and continue onto the next stage.The music is rather relaxing and don't get old too quickly but after a long while, you may just want to mute it and play your own music instead. The puzzles aren't too hard but will require a bit of your brain to solve.My biggest gripe is control. As you are controlling your little critter around, sometimes it gets confused or locks up and goes back and forth back and forth cause it doesn't really know what you want. Instead of pointing and clicking and your creature going there, you have to hold it, and not al paths are self-evident. The game moves at a very slow pace, so if you're not in a realxed mood, don't bother to play it or you might get frustrated with the slow speed. Personally I think the game has no replay value, but for such a cheap game, did you really expect any?Overall 6/10 - Get it on sale for an interesting mix of art, music and puzzles.			"

												The game shines in the art department but it's dull everywhere else.It's a mobile port in nearly all the bad aspects of it, no options of any kind, mobile looking icons, hand instead of a mouse cursor.Even though it is a short game (about 1 hour and 20 minutes) it ended with a mix of ""thank god it's over!"" with a ""that's it?"". The pace is bad, the ending was pretty much ""hey, you finished the last puzzle, now the screen will just slowly fade out, you'll get an achievement and be sent back to the main menu"".I can't really recomend this, even at a discount there are better games in the point and click department on Kongregate that don't cost a penny and are paced just right.

 About MorphopolisMorphopolis, a simple yet intriguing game. A pathway made to learn the morphology of the small creatures living in unseen ground. Playing a tiny creature gathering and evolving to the next stage. It is an abstract except realistic concept of evolution.You are first invited by the artistic style of visual artwork as you soon immerse into the world of insects. The visual layout is painted into 2-Dimensional layers which creates the 3-Dimensional atmosphere and depth. The colours are all earthy and saturated which emphasises the textural tone of the visual design. The creator really has brought out the artistic feel and paintings to life. Controls and GameplayThe controls are fairly simply and all movement is controlled by a simple mouse clicks. The character moves by holding down the mouse as the character moves towards it. This development of movement is a really nice touch towards the essence of the lower level world. However I do have to complain that there is no quicker movement. Travelling back screens if you missed pieces is very tedious as you are trapped in the sluggish movement of your creature, but at least it does give some reason on how these bugs move. That they travel at their own pace and shouldn’t be rushed. Controlling movement around objects and towards areas can be fiddly as the direction is not always accurate when you want to turn above and right except it just goes straight up. At least it has a unique style of movement and is a patient game as you find the items.All in All Morphopolis is a really nice Puzzle Game!9/10 From Me Sweep 	 "

												I've played for two hours and that was actually enough to complete the game. I thought the premise of embarking on a 'parasitic crusade' was amusing, that is actually kind of what you do in this. I really liked it.- Yes, it's quite short and a mobile port which might put some people off- But it has a variety of puzzles which I found unique, interesting and challenging

The first level is quite simple you just have to find objects such as leaves and little yellow balls, complete a puzzle and use the stuff you find to complete the stage. Each level is basically like this but they gradually become larger and more complex.-----Each stage you take a new form. Each level ends with you resurrecting and taking taking control of a new and larger insect i.e. you burrow your little aphid grub into the head of a grasshopper then in the next stage you are in the form of that grasshopper, then a bee and so on.-----Yeah finding a certain amount of specific objects scattered and hidden randomly throughout each stage sounds kind of mundane. But I enjoyed that kind of activity, it's kind of like Where's Wally. It was sometimes challenging to track the last few objects.-----Interspersed throughout that were the puzzles. I was never able to figure them out straight away. There are no instructions. Sometimes I had to fiddle around to determine what you are meant to do in them, before I could even puzzle my way through them. But once I'd done that and completed each one, I found most them quite satisfying. One of them ended a bit too quickly before it became challenging. That one involved repeating a sequence demonstrated by the illuminating tails of insects, which became increasingly more complex. I think that one should have gone on for longer to really challenge you. That would have been cool because you actually create a kind of melody. Another puzzle was actually a jigsaw puzzle made up of differently shaped moth and butterflies. It was a simple idea, but I really liked that one.I liked the artwork quite a bit. It made me think of illustrated children's books that I've seen before. The music is really nice and soothing. Your insects dawdle along, you cannot rush around. So it's a slow paced and relaxing game.-----One thing of note is that this game basically has no options menu. This is probably a lot to do with the fact that it is a mobile port. I used windows volume control to turn sound down, Alt-enter didn't work for toggle fullscreen. So had to maximise the window and use a third party program to force into into a borderless window.I thought the game was short and sweet. Personally I'm not too worried about paying $8.50 for a two hour game. But obviously that may be considered a good price by everyone in this case. The game didn't really have much of an ending. You are just taken back to the main menu without even being taken shown the credits. Not that I really cared too much. However I think it would pretty cool if the developers add more stages, but I think they'd run out of bigger insect eventually lolClick here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

												could've been a lot more... as it is, it is little more than a glorified interactive art gallery. don't get me wrong, the art is pretty darn awesome (except that last bug in chapter 5 looks really bad for some reason). the landscape makes me wonder if insects see the world in such a vivid way with their different eyes and biology... unfortunately, there's really little else other than the art and immersive ambient music.the controls are annoying. the bugs move terribly slow. the hidden objects are fairly easy to find, but making the bug move to and fro to access different screens... ugh. the puzzles are interesting, but without ANY bit of instruction, they are basically mocking your ability to guess what exactly you're supposed to solve until you ""get"" it. the ""flower draughts"" especially... how are you supposed to guess that you have to move those flowers in that particular way? frustrating and needlessly so. puzzles should at least have a hint on your first move, so it's subtle but not completely dense.my final comment is on the ""plot"". the insect you control ""morphs"" as you progress through the 5 stages; however, your bug actually only metamorphoses once (from 1 to 2). for the other progressions your bug actually changes SPECIES, which not only does not make sense, it also feels awkward. while you are picking up pieces of a fallen bug, you may be thinking: i'm helping this fallen bug in some way. but it turns out... nope. you end up burrowing into its carcass and somehow magically end up ""driving"" the bug you were fixing. what kind of weird is that? it could've been a charming little ""bug helps bug"" story, or an informative ""bug eats bug"" science lesson; instead it is neither... and it doesn't make sense as a sci-fi or fantasy either -- why morph into another bug?the ending doesn't feel satisfying either. i was fully expecting a good cutscene to explain what my bug was trying to do... but nope. nothing. just back to title screen. i felt really cheated at the lack of any resolution... which is why the whole ""game"" really came across as little more than an animated gallery.get it when it's on sale just to see the fantastic hand-drawn art style with the mostly-spot on miniature life animation. otherwise, you can get much more satisfying puzzle games on steam for less.

												Even though the art is undeniably beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely pitiful. It really does look like the developers put all of their effort into the game looks, and didn't really spare a thought for the gameplay. The puzzles don't show any indication of what you're actually supposed to do, it's up to you to either click around until something happens and figure it out from there, or get so annoyed that you just look it up. The levels are just a mess, nothing indicates what you're meant to be doing, other than collecting objects for a bug you randomly clicked on, and would have had no idea that you were supposed to do so on purpose. I feel like they attemped to insert some kind of storyline, but all I can seem to gather is that for some reason or another if you put dead bugs back together and throw yellowy balls of gloop at them, you can crawl inside them and take control. That isn't even MENTIONING the game mechanics themselves. Often your character will continue walking in the same direction without you clicking anything, and you will just have to wait for it to stop. Sometimes, for some reason clicking on your character will cause things to happen. There was never any prior indication of this. There is also no indication of where you can and can't walk, it all looks the same. Fortunately this game isn't very expensive at all, otherwise I would have been very annoyed that I had spent my money on this. Some of the things in the screenshots aren't even IN the game. If you're looking for a game that looks good, go for it. If you're actually interested in gameplay? Wouldn't reccomend it, even for this price.			"

												This point-and-click advanture game is fun to play, very imaginative and creative. I adore the background music and the graphics although bugs normally would creep me out. The puzzles were fun to solve though because there was no instructions what so ever, it took me a while to figure what I was trying to achieve. Right now, the game only lasts around 1 hour or so, which seemed a bit too short for me (especially for a price of around $10). But would definetly recommend this game if there was more levels to it to add a bit more content.			"

												Morphopolis looks like a weird game. And an unique one. I can definitely tell you that it’s weird, especially in its art design and storytelling (if you can even call it that), but it’s not as unique as you would think. The game will feel very familiar to those who’ve played hidden object games before and have taken on a couple of simple puzzles in the past. And once you start playing it’s really not even that weird. You’ll see.But Morphopolis isn’t for just anyone in my opinion. It’s short with only 5 levels, but it’s also very slow. The creature you control moves at the slowest pace possible and you unfortunately need him to navigate through the levels. Not much is explained when you start; a simple gesture to move your mouse from one point to the other is pretty much all it will tell you to do. The rest is up to you. I like the fact that it doesn’t hold your hand all the way through, but some of the level designs aren’t easily navigated and that results in your character getting stuck in parts of the environment or your character not knowing which way to go when you’re clearly moving your mouse to the right direction.If we ignore these flaws the gameplay basically comes down to you clicking anywhere on the screen, hoping to unlock new objectives. New objectives can usually be found by clicking on other creatures and it then comes down to finding the requested items. Some of these items are expertly hidden and some of them are way too obvious. If you really can’t find a certain item you can always ask for a hint; a meter in the upper right corner will refill after you click on it once. After that you can request another hint if you wish. Anyway, it also requires a fair amount of backtracking, but the slow pace keeps it from being (and becoming) any fun.Sometimes a better, deeper puzzle unlocks after finishing a certain objective. These range from a solitaire-like puzzle to solving a jigsaw puzzle. Around level 4 the difficulty picks up and I must admit I had a hard time solving the puzzles found in level 4 and 5.A story can be interpreted but isn’t necessarily there I would say. It’s about your character growing up I think but please keep in mind that that’s my very basic interpretation of it all. The game doesn’t end with credits rolling; it just brings you back to the ‘level select’ menu. So I’m not sure if it’s even trying to tell a story.The art direction is phenomenal. I don’t know what I would call it exactly, but it’s colorful and full of detail. It’s definitely worth a look. Sounds are pretty much non-existent and the music on the other hand is pretty good. The game runs in a window that can be resized as you see fit but I’m not sure if I would recommend it as I had issues solving the music/memory puzzle because of it (or else it’s just a bug). In any case, the graphics remain sharp, even when the window is maxed out.Morphopolis is certainly a pretty game. But it’s not a really fun game. Even though the game isn’t terribly long I wish it ended sooner. It might be because of the (semi-)casual gameplay, it might be because of the slow pacing, I’m not really sure. One thing I am sure of however is that I would suggest people to wait for a price drop. The current price is just a tad too high for now.[Rating: 65/100]			"

												Why do bad things happen to good people? Or why does good art happen to bad games, for that matter? After playing this, I'm even more confused about it than ever.Morphopolis feels like a blend of a small scale, 2D, point and click adventure, mixed with the weaker elements of an offbeat hidden object game. You'll control an insect as it gathers objects for an array of bugs or plants and occasionally assemble the body parts of other, larger dead bugs so you can occupy its carcass to progress to the next stage. No, really. I didn't make that last part up. I never knew that's how evolution worked, I'm learning things already from this game, which is an unusual exception, given how unwilling it is to teach you anything else at any point.Aside from a not very helpful cursor appearing at the start to prompt you how to move, there's no other attempt to guide the player in any way. I don't expect a game to hold my hand the whole way through, but surely page one of chapter one of the game design manual should tell you the first thing you do is teach a player the mechanics of your game and how to navigate and interact with it. When you struggle to move from your starting position in a game then you know you're in trouble. And that's a problem that persists the whole way through.To move you have to point to your desired destination then hold down the left mouse button. The first problem here is understanding where you can even go at any point. You can click on your insect to momentarily summon a trail of green dust around your immediate area and show potential paths, but even this felt surprisingly unhelpful. But even when you do understand where to go, getting there is a task in itself. Movement seems temperamental at best and my bug would frequently appear to get stuck, waggling back and forth while rooted to the spot, or else fail to move at all, requiring repeated attempts before it would eventually go where I wanted it to... slowly. Very, very, slowly. Because, y'know... insects are notorious for being some of the most slow-moving and cumbersome creatures in the animal kingdom. Really, something so fundamental as basic movement and navigation should not be an infuriating obstacle the player should have to constantly wrestle with as part of the game's challenge.There are a small handful of puzzles added to the mix, but these aren't especially satisfying to complete, and like the rest of the game, no attempt is made to explain them to the player in any way. At one point you control a bee with the ability to hop. It doesn't seem like something important when you discover it, more like a cute little idiosyncrasy, but later in the stage it proves vital for completing a section. I found this purely by accident rather than having it hinted at in any way, and were it not for being in the right place at the right time, I likely would have needed to resort to a guide to complete the game. That kind of methodology to progression just stinks of bad design to me.It's not a game entirely without its charms, as the sound, look and short play time are its greatest virtues, but when a game's world is more fun to look at and listen to than to actually interact with or inhabit, then you have to ask yourself ""what's the point?"". I'd sooner recommend looking up images or videos of the game and experiencing its finer points that way. Otherwise, I'd strongly advice passing over on playing this one yourself.			"

""Creepy crawlers in a mini HoG / puzzle game""This amazing and unique HD graphics adventure plays mostly like a classic HoG. You have to find hidden pieces of insects before you can proceed in the story. If you find them a little nice puzzle awaits you. Insects and their metamorphosis is the main subject of this game. There's a hint system. But actually there exist no menus and pathway hints on the maps. So you are lost in the jungle of microcosmos. And sometimes the mouse controls are really horrible. Nevertheless the game makes fun and at least it's an enjoyable lightweight of puzzleing.			"

												Among all the games in the recent Indie Royale Soapsuds bundle, this game is the cream of the crop. Morphopolis is a nature and ambient (casual) puzzle game. It features vibrant art and combined with some cool puzzles. The game has you search for items hidden all over the screen in order to progress further. Some of the items are actually hidden quite well. After obtaining the items, you are then subjected to a few unique puzzles in each area (a total of 5 areas). The puzzles were well-made and felt just about right. They were neither too easy nor too hard. Overall the game took me about 2 hours but that was definitely 2 hours well spent.4/5			"

												Well, this one is done and dusted. It took me a little less than 2 hours to finish. This was a very beautiful point and click adventure where you follow the metamorphosis of a caterpillar to a full blown cricket. Such lush colors abound within this game. The puzzles werent too challenging overall, but were appropriate to the game in every instance. There isnt really any sort of tutorial. You are just dropped in to figure it out on your own, and this shouldnt be a big deal at all for anybody. The only real knock on the game IMO was the music. The music was actually very pleasant and soothing, but man was it repetitious. I wish there had been full tracks rather than the same loop over and over. All that said, I very much enjoyed the game. I give it 7.5 caterpillars changing into a form of higher consciousness out of 10.			"

												This game is about the life stages of a bug. The art and music in this game are very relaxing. There are also puzzles on each level you must solve and figure out. Some people have issues with these puzzles, but just go watch some youtube videos if you get stuck as this is how i figured out last hardest puzzle in the game. I recommend this game for Artistic styles and music in it. The storyline is non-existent, but i feel this game does not need a storyline. It just involves a bug evolving into different forms.Also, for those who are card hunters, this game has card drops, but be aware, you may have ti ""wait"" awhile for them to drop..The achievments are pretty good for getting pretty simple, except the puzzle ones. If you do not like puzzles, it may be hard to get them.Recommended game!			"

Morphopolis - a 'maybe' game?This is where I wish Steam's review system offered more than a recommended yes/no option, because saying that this game is recommended implies that the game is more than it is and ignores a couple of frustrations, but saying the game is not recommended does the game an undeserved disservice.  So bear in mind this recommendation is actually a MAYBE, and read on to know whether this is the game for you...What is it?Morphopolis is a casual and short puzzle/hidden-object game crafted over 5 beautiful levels.  You start life as a small insect and, using point-and-click, must find your way through each level where you will metamorphose into a bigger insect.  If you've played the excellent Machinarium, the gameplay style is very similar (point and click, and find hidden objects) but there is where the similarity ends.  Morphopolis is nowhere near as long as Machinarium, the puzzles are not as challenging nor as varied, and overall the game is very simple to complete, with only the final puzzle offering any greater degree of difficulty.What's to like?The unique artwork and ambient music are a joy to experience (the visuals are gorgeous), and the lack of hand-holding will be a blessing for gamers who like to work out what they must do.  Every insect and every flower might offer some interaction (or might not) and it's left to you to discover.  Once you uncover an insect or flower that you can interact with, it will have some basic needs to be fulfilled (ie hidden objects - like finding 10 pollen seeds and feeding them to the flower) before it will enable a new pathway for your insect to use (either by unfolding a new branch to climb or unblocking the way to a new area).  Each level will have a final puzzle to solve, which are mostly of average difficulty and very enjoyable (if brief).The not-so-goodThe lack of hand-holding would be most welcome if only elements that were meant to be interacted with would be a little more responsive.  As it stands, many interactive things need several experimental clicks before they yield (or not), and because there is no clue offered by the interface as to whether an element is interactive or not, you'll be clicking a lot of things to progress.  Navigation was a particular issue, with the player's insect dawdling at an annoyingly slow pace and frequently becoming stuck in areas that weren't actually blocked - especially frustrating given there was a fair bit of back-tracking to do.  There was a lack of variety in solving each stage (outside of the end puzzles) and it became too easy to solve as a result.  Finally, the last level had a disappointing ending: given that my insect successfully metamorphosed through each of the previous 4 stages, I truly expected to metamorphose into some big and beautiful butterfly at the end of the game.  Instead, the game simply faded to black, leaving me wondering whether the game had ended or not.  Because of the game's simplicity, there is no real replay value.ConclusionMorphopolis is a pleasant diversion from bigger and more challenging games, and it's a piece of art in many ways.  However, it's somewhat let down by its short length without any real ending, frustrating interface and the lack of variety needed to complete each stage and reach the end-of-level puzzle.  I would recommend it in a heartbeat at a sale price, and would also recommend it at its full £3.99 price if you are looking for something pretty and lightweight to play for a short while (especially if you do enjoy games like Machinarium).  Otherwise, there are longer and more challenging games with a little less frustration that might be more worthwhile for you.			"

												This was a fun little hidden object game with a fresh new style in terms of the genre. I love the HOG genre of games and anyone else that does has bound to have noticed by now that most of them are pretty standard in terms of story and style. Whether it be an Indiana Jones style treasure hunter, an antiques trader, a supernatural entity or just the classic crime detective, Morphopolis puts an interesting new twist on HOGs. “Lose yourself in the mesmerizing, fantastical world of Morphopolis, a game about transformation and discovery.”It reminds me a little bit like The Tiny Bang Story, which was another small but unique HOG, in the way the HOG elements are laid out. It’s more interactive and visual then your standard HOG game. Instead of just being given a list to things to find, you play as a bug, traversing its way across a lucid insect world. You click and drag your mouse to move and although the direction isn’t entirely clear I think it’s easy enough to explore and figure things out. You can interact with things around you and figure out what you need to be finding from that. The gameplay for me was fine. I read a few reviews before I bought the game that suggested the controls and direction of the game was annoying to some seeing as it may have been a port over from touch screen devices. In all honesty, I found it completely fine to control and didn’t feel that directions were ever necessary. Although on gameplay alone I would say that if you took away the stunning visuals, there wouldn’t be much too it.The art in this game is beautiful, especially on a bigger screen. The many different colours and details will keep you interested in what’s going on. Which is great given the games quite laid back pacing. The visuals in the game definitely make up for the lack of actual gameplay as mentioned above. With that said, every now and then you get puzzles of which I thought were pretty good. There were a few that I did have to actually think about to solve. The last one especially being the hardest to do. Overall the game took me just under 2 hours to complete. It’s a fairly short game but I felt that it was neither too short nor too long, which is always good. It’s a nice little game to kill a few hours with and also get another 100%ed game. As far as I am aware, the achievements are purely for completely the game’s milestones and its puzzles without using hints. So it’s an easy one to do. All in all I really liked this game, it was short but sweet and generally a nice little indie game. TL:DR : An interesting HOG game with a unique new style for the genre. Basic gameplay but beautiful art, which more than makes up for it. Good puzzles, short and easy to 100%. Definitely give it a try.			"

												Very pretty, good music, but very short.  It took me about 75 minutes to go through the whole thing and most of that time was spent backtracking because your bug moves friggin slow and every time you solve one minipuzzle you have to revisit all the scenes for the next mini. (the rest of my hours is idling for card drops)I was also expecting to learn something about insects along the way.  However, the presentation is fanciful rather than realistic and there was nothing substantive to take away.The game itself is mostly hidden objects and, mercifully, there's a rechargable hint pointer because some of the objects are very hidden, although that doesn't work in the half dozen instances where you have to guess that clicking your insect in the right spot does something special.  The hidden objects unlock several longer-form puzzles which are a mix of logic and visual matching, all rather easy, some downright trivial, with a couple that will take a few minutes to figure out.  ***Absolutely not solvable if you're color blind as some of them require very subtle color matching.***5/10.  If you get it on a good sale or in a bundle, it's definitely worth a little dabble for the visuals. Otherwise, it's too short and light to recommend.			"

												This game is gorgeous. The art style is unique and that is reason enough in my mind to get it, especially if its on sale. The soundtrack is very calming and helps you not get frustrated with the puzzles. The game is meant to be enjoyed slowly, taking in this interesting world. While I love the look and sounds of the game, I have a couple of nitpicks. With each level, I feel you have to click everything to find the next objective. There is sometimes some confusion about where your little insect is allowed to explore. There is a hint system that keeps the player from frustration. The puzzles are everywhere from easy to frustrating. Whether they are easy will simply depend on the player. With each puzzle you are left to figure it out, without any help or explanation. Also, once you begin a puzzle, there is no way to leave it. If you want to quit, you will have to crash the game. There is no save option, so once you begin the level, be prepared to finish it, or have the game run in the background. I had to walk away from certain puzzles sometimes, but the soundtrack is so calming, I didn't mind hearing it. Despite the nitpicks, this is a wonderful little puzzle game with great visuals.			"

												Morphopolis is a hidden-object/mini-puzzle game. What makes it special is its insect theme: you guide this bug throughout various stages of its life-cycle transformations!The game has beautiful hand drawn graphics, fluent animation and relaxing/atmospheric/ambient musical overlay. It is pretty simple (mouse only, no settings), with no text at all (button for visual hints only) and a reasonable amount of content and difficulty: I completed its 5 levels in 2 hours, using external help only once. Some of the mini-puzzles (there's 1-2 per level) I did find a bit hard. What mostly frustrated me is that often you don't know what you're supposed to do in the mini-puzzles, or that there's more screens accessible during the hidden objects ""quests"". The Hint button does not help there...In overall, I recommend Morphopolis, much more so for its ultra competitive price: 0.99€ (I got it on discount, for 0.24€!).			"

Puzzzzling puzzzzle with bugzzzzRating : OkGuide your morphed insect in this puzzler game where you have to manipulate and collect stuff to continue to the next screen. Kinda refreshing if you take the art style, scenes and backdrop. No mysteries to solve, horrors to overcome or keys to find. But as with all it gets a bit frustrating when you hit that one screen where you really don't know what to do. And that's the bit weak side of this game: you are literally thrown into the scenes without the slightest idea what to do. Some screens have hint options, other are deprived of that so you really don't know what to do and how to continue. A bit of experimentation and try-out is then the only thing you can do.What also bothers me is that the game doesn't have any options other than quit and 'go to main menu'. No settings to alter the music or sounds, no resolution options or even a full screen option. Other than that I can recommend the game if you like point-and-click discovery games in a slightly different setting than usually. But to call it great great a bit too far.			"

												Short hidden insect game.Well, technically it's a hidden object game, but in many respects it is different from your typical HOG: here we have hand-drawn art instead of your 3D hodgepodge of object; biological processes instead of a plot with a woman seeking some daughter (not necessarily hers); multi-screen scenes; and collection quests that originate from within the scene.It feels very relaxing (some might call it slow), leaving you to ponder and puzzle out what you're supposed to be doing. I spent a very pleasant 2 hours doing just that. Some of the puzzles are logical, others are actual puzzles: the most ingenious is the one where you put objects back into the scene (putting parts of a plant back in place), and I wish there more of those.It's casual, short, very different, looks beautiful, and plays well.

												Published by: Dan WaltersDeveloped by: Dan Walters, Ceri WilliamsGenre: Hidden Object, Point & Click, PuzzleRelease Date: August 14, 2014Time to complete: 90 minutesIntroductionFind hidden objects in this beautiful bug-inspired artistic puzzle game.GameplayMorphopolis is a really cute bug-themed point and click puzzle game with a relaxing and atmospheric soundtrack. You play as various bugs as you solve puzzles and find hidden objects to progress to the next chapter. The game is very slow-moving, which was frustrating at times as you have to do a lot of back and forth movement between the different sections to find all the objects. The game doesn’t give any instructions, so you have to work it out for yourself. That’s not really an issue as the game is very straightforward, however there were some points where I wasn’t entirely sure how to proceed and thus spent a lot of time slowly moving from place to place, trying to work out where to go.There is no save function, so if you don’t complete a chapter (there are 5), you have to start it over. This wouldn’t be an issue for me if the movement wasn’t so incredibly slow. The chapters aren’t particularly long though, so it’s not so bad (though, a save feature would be a nice addition).Difficulty & ChallengeThe hidden object component isn’t particularly difficult, but the few puzzles scattered throughout the game do increase in difficulty as the game goes on, the last puzzle being quite a brain teaser. It took me roughly 90 minutes to complete the whole game, but your play time will likely be significantly less than mine if you’re good at puzzles (evidently, I’m pretty average at them!). Only a mouse is needed to play Morphopolis, so the controls add to the simplicity of the game.Graphics & ArtIt’s no secret I’m drawn in by ’pretty’ games, and that was a major component in my decision to purchase Morphopolis. All of the art and animation within the game is completely hand-drawn with beautiful, vibrant colours, and is very pleasant to look at (unless of course you’re not a fan of creepy crawlies).SoundtrackSimple, serene and effective; the soundtrack is largely what makes this game so relaxing, with simple instrumentals coupled with sounds from nature.Replay ValueBecause it’s a puzzler, once you’ve worked the puzzles out the first time, there’s probably no real point playing it again.AchievementsAll the achievements in Morphopolis can be obtained simply by playing through the game. An easy 100%!Overall VerdictBecause of the enjoyable few hours of gameplay Morphopolis gave me, I would definitely recommend it (especially on sale, I picked this one up for only 50 cents and it seems to go on sale frequently). It provides just enough challenge to keep it interesting, and the simplicity makes it a great choice for all age groups.Overall Score: 6/10 "

												'Morphopolis' is a casual 'hidden object game'. As is common in these games, there are some puzzles to be solved, too. The game consists of 5 levels which will take you 25 minutes each on average, mostly depending on how fast you solve the puzzles. The insect you control moves slowly, so this game is not for the impatient.GameplayGameplay consists of you clicking on large objects (large insects or plants) to see if they need completion (e.g. missing legs or petals). If they do, you'll see an icon of what type of item you need to collect and how many of those you need to collect. Next, you'll be looking for these items and when you have them, click on the large insect or plant again to complete it and advance through the game. Also, when you click on the insect you control, it'll er... do something that can open 'containers' like berries or closed flowers. None of this is explained in the game. There is some sort of a tutorial but it just points you at the object you need to click on next, without explaining what's happening. Especially the last part I mentioned about clicking on your avatar was something they should have explained. It took me a while to figure it out, I was about to forfait when I accidentally clicked on my avatar near a berry.Graphics and soundThe graphics are nice enough but not breathtaking as some people would have you believe. Maybe I expected more simply because a lot of people talk about how stunning the graphics are, could be. Also, during the first level I saw green flashes across half the screen from time to time. I run Windows 7. When looking for a solution for this, I stumbled upon a lot of complaints that the game is suffering from extreme screen flickering when running it in Windows 10, rendering the game unplayable for them. Luckily, the flashing stopped for me after the first level. So there are some technical issues with the game for some people. The background music is very nice and relaxing. It fits the game's atmosphere completely.There are no options whatsoever, not for graphics or sound or anything.A word about the Steam extras'Morphopolis' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are most basic and 100% unmissable. I know it's not easy to come up with original achievements for a hidden object game but it can be done. One quick example would be a well-hidden object in each level that you need to find for an optional achievement. The puzzles are certainly a missed opportunity for some optional achievements. One example could be to finish one or more of the puzzles in less than a specified number of moves. VerdictIf you like hidden object games that include some puzzling, you'll love this game, although you may find it way too short. If you like puzzle games and/or point & click adventure games but aren't crazy about hidden object games, like I am, give Morphopolis a try anyway. It's short enough, the objects you need to find aren't that well hidden (it's not a pixel hunt at all!) and you really can't go wrong at this price, can you?			"

												This game has potential, but I think that need some improvements in gameplay, like a menu with tutorial or key bindings. When I paused the game I don't understood nothing, I leave the game 3 times because I don't knew what the icons means, I think that had other box saying, ""Are you sure you want to leave?"", or something like this, would improve. The gameplay is very slow, because the animations, I don't want to wait the animations, I want to play. If had a option in menu for the animations would improve too. The art is very good, I liked so much, if this game  would have a update with this improvements, certainly that I'll play this game more.			"

												I was drawn to Morphopolis for the wonderfully unique art-style and the promise of relaxing music and gameplay. Morphopolis delivers on style and audio, but the gameplay swings between calm, maybe even boring, and on the other end of the scale it can be infuriating. If you like hidden object games I'd definitely recommend this, but to most people I would say give it a miss. I'm personally not keen on hidden object games, but I thought I'd give this one a go anyway for a change of pace. Some some of the puzzles in Morphopolis left me without any clue how to interact with them, and I had to resort to Googling to know how to even grasp some basic controls. The most important thing I could have known going into the game is that clicking/tapping on your own bug is something you can (and should) do, which simply didn't occur to me until I read an introduction on how to play the game after becoming stuck, which kind of seems like the sort of thing the game should be guiding you into doing. The most positive thing about this game was that I was able to draw my wife into playing it with me. It works great on a touch screen so we were both able to tap away at the screen together working on puzzles and looking for hidden bugs and junk. It's not a long game, but at the end of it we were glad it was over.4 out of 10, would not dig around for bugs again. Purdy though.			"

												While the puzzles were challenging enough, and therefore entertaining (heck, trying to figure out how to play the game was a challenge in itself), the amount of time spent walking slowly from frame to frame of the maps was ridiculous. This is a short game, let it be short. Don't artificially inflate the play time by adding the tedium of lumbering all over the map for every round of hidden items. And I kind of get the whole minimalist thing, but I expect labels on menu buttons. I got to the end of the second level and didn't realize I had to go into the green glowy spot to finish the level so I clicked on the menu-shaped button only to see the same button and a forward arrow. Having no idea what to do I clicked the menu button not realizing it would take me back to the main menu. Well, turns out that erases all of your progress leaving you to start from the beginning. It wasn't a huge loss of time, but it was a stupid loss of time when all they had to do was put a few words on the screen.I was likewise unimpressed by the art and atmosphere of the game, but you can chalk that up to personal preference. This wouldn't really have been an issue if those aspects hadn't been hyped, but the music was dull and the art just meh. Still, the game is only two bucks so it's not that long of a limb to step out onto.			"

												I enjoyed Morphopolis. It's a casual game, where you solve puzzles and find hidden items within the vibrant magnified insect world. The music is very good - soothing. I enjoyed the artwork also - visually the game is pleasing to look at. It's not a particularly hard game - maybe 1 or 2 puzzles that might cause you to think a bit, but overall it's more of an engaging but pleasant and relaxing experience. The controls caused me to get stuck once or twice (there's a puzzle on level 4 where alot of players, like myself, seem to get to and think the game isn't responding.Overall, the game is engaging and doesn't overstay it's welcome. I enjoyed it!			"

												Simple gameplay yet a little challenging in some areas. The soundtrack and flowing nature of the animation made it easy to take my time solving some of the more complex puzzles and tasks and was enjoyable in a relaxing sort of way. I like the nature-based artwork with an abstract touch and reminded me of old botany lithographs you might see in some old herbalist or gardening journals. As others have commented, it is short and possibly overpriced for the length, but still enjoyable and I would like to see more like it with more sections perhaps and more options for adjusting sound and a fullscreen setting which, sadly, were missing from the game. Since it played windowed, I WAS able to just maximize the window for a windowed fullscreen so it wasn't too bad. All in all very lovely and interesting concept for a game. I would recommend it for something mellow to play.			"

It will take you back to your picture book days.The gameplay is pretty straight forward with varying degrees of difficulty.

												Hooray! Finally done.What's Morphopolis?Morphopolis is a puzzle game. This game educates us about transformation of the insect (metamorphosis) . Although this game reminded me about Biology when I was studying at senior high school, I don't know what kind of insect appears in this game. At least I just remembered one thing, what Lepidoptera[en.wikipedia.org]is.The gameplay?In game, you not only see the beauty scenery of nature but also the relaxing music. There are five chapters. Each chapter presents the stage of metamorphosis. You have to solve the riddles (finding the things and solving the puzzle) in order going to next stage. You can play this game for short time actually, but it depends how fast you can solve the riddles.Should I recommend Morphopolis?Yes, I should. I recommend this game for puzzle and Indie game lovers.If you are not one of them, will you give a chance for Morphopolis?Grab this game guys! It's cheap.P.S.I would like to say thanks to my friend, Haru Yoshida. You're awesome.			"

												Originally released for the smart phone and tablet market, Morphopolis is one of the few games deemed worthy of its transition to the PC platform. While essentially a hidden objects title, the atmosphere was greatly enhanced by the unique art style and ambient sounds, there were also enough variety in the puzzles to give players a run for their money.That said, the game did have its moments of frustration, the severe lack of instructions for instance caused a few hair pulling moments when played without a guide. The controls can at times be unresponsive and jerky as well, since it was made for a touch screen in mind.The last puzzle was especially evil and uncalled for, not to mention the game immediately ends after that without any form of closure, the biggest blunder in an otherwise enjoyable experience.Buy it if you have nothing else to play, or get it during a discount.

												I dont know why I even have this but okMorphopolis feels like a school project. A good school project! But a school project nonetheless.I wouldn't say it was a bad experience, and at the price and lenght it's at, I can hardly bring myself to dislike it. I can also appreciate the art, despite the fact that I personally dislike this kind of style.I decided to not recommend this game because...

												An atmospheric 'bugs-in-nature' game without (functionality) bugs ;)It comes with easy point-and-click environements and a couple of puzzles. Only a few were challenging and I was stuck at one puzzle, probably because I didn't know 'that' board game...Furthermore it's slow-paced, not annoying, but you have to backtrack and go along the same paths a lot; that's a bit annoying. The 'bug control/steering' is okay, but it requires accuracy and isn't always optimal.Verdict: 7.5/10 I recommend it, but only for max. €3,- because the game is short.			"

												When I first entered Morphopolis, I found myself inside a painting. Gentle background music embraced me, and I felt safe. This game is a soothing emotional experience. It's about forgetting all your troubles and let yourself immerse in the colors, in the heart-warming atmosphere.More on a technical side, Morphopolis is a 'hidden object' game, where you need to look around to find all the items from a list... and resolve puzzles.It's one of those sweet, slow-paced relaxing games to play before bed, sipping a cup of tea.Oh and it's only 0.99 Euro.

Short version: 82%Morphopolis is an incredibly short hidden object puzzle game and art showcase, where you control a bug in a series of astonishing, hand-drawn scenes.Long version:Morphopolis is a simple hidden object game, where the goal is to gather a series of similar items. These items unlock a minigame, another item, or a new screen you can explore.There is no real story: you control a bug which ends up in a larger body in each chapter, and that’s about it.Therefore, the game sells itself with a unique (slightly Moebius-like) art style. This somewhat alien landscape is a marvel to look at, but doesn’t overstay its welcome: most chapters are barely ten minute long– even though your movement is incredibly slow. Naturally this means the whole game lasts barely an hour, but if you like this distinct visual style, Morphopolis is an excellent pick.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale for 24 cents. And for 24 cents I obviously have no regrets. The only negative things I have to say about this game is that its a bit slow paced with the insects you play. I found myself getting a little impatient where I needed to go, but nothing that makes this game bad.One thing I really loved about the game is the soundtrack, which I found very relaxing. The art in the game is colorful and well done. And the game itself is like a clicker mixed with a hidden puzzle game, which is really fun. Some of mini games can be a bit confusing if you aren't sure what you are suppose to do. The game itself is about 3 hours long, and the achievements are really easy to get.			"

												This is the most beautifully illustrated game I have ever seen. It is a very unique point-and-click game. The concept of being an insect and going on a journey of metomorphosis is quite original. The hidden objects and puzzles were not too difficult, but they weren't too easy, either.The point-and-click mechanics could use some work. It pretty much required clicking very carefully directly in front of the bug in the direction you want it to go. It could not find its own path when there were multiple ways to go. It would also turn around and go to a previous screen if the clicking was not precise enough.There is one thing that takes a lot of fun out of this game: the final beetle slider puzzle. It's so difficult that there's a long discussion thread about it. Slider puzzles are games unto themselves. To put one into such a pleasant, casual game is just infuriating. Luckily, someone made a solver to end the insanity.Still, it's a pleasant game to experience and admire.


This is a gorgeous game, but that beetle swap puzzle needs to go! It's pretty bad when everyone is complaining about it.

												First of all, I bought this game for the cards, not gonna lie. Upon running the game, I was just planning on leaving it on until I get all the card drops while I play either another game or the Monster Summer Game 2015 like I've been doing the past few days. But the first scene I saw (after the loading screen) made me go, ""Woah."" The art is beautiful, unlike what I generally expect from games that go as low as this. I'm a bit of a puzzle and hidden object man myself so I decided to give this a try. I spent my first minute [after clicking on the first chapter] thinking about what the hell do I do because there's nothing that tells you how things work at all off the bat, not even any in-game settings. The hint button helped out a lot though, until I've gotten the hang of it. The whole thing is pretty short, even for its full price, but my overall experience was great. The only negative thing that I could say about this game is that with respect to the kind of bug you're controlling, you [the bug] just move too slowly. I didn't mind the progress in the chapter not being saved when you exit as I was able to finish it in one sitting (with a lot of alt-tabbing) anyways.Full to heavily discounted price, you get what you paid for, and then some.9/10			"

												Morphopolis is one of those little gems you only find every once and a while.The quaint, relaxing and rather beautiful soundtrack does wonders to match with the utterly gorgeous visuals. The game is a gorgeous conglomeration of different puzzles, stitched together to make a wonderful seamless whole. Sometimes the way to progress is not immediately obvious and that is what adds to the level of difficulty, and maybe once or twice a patch of annoying.Beginning your journey as an aphid grub, you find the puzzles that need solving and then find the parts within the environment around you to help you progress. Whether it would be a disguise to scare a beetle off, legs or antennae to fix the next bug body in which you will inhabit to the next level.With the game only having 5 fairly short chapters to it, it does make for a rather short play, without much replay value. Be that as it may, it still gives you a solid 2 to 3 hours at the minimum of play.I never once found myself wanting to put this down as the combo of the amazing soundtrack, visuals and just the layout of each level made me want to progress and become the bug God(ess). That also being said, the ending was quite brief, aside from the 'Bug God' achievement popping up and the screen slowly fading to black, I wouldn't have really expected it to stop there, in fact I was waiting for the level section to return for me to select the next level, but such didn't happen.None the less, if you're in the mood for a slow paced, chill, relaxing and utterly gorgeous game with some decently difficult puzzles, this is for you.Enjoyed every second of this little number.

												In a stayle akin to Machinarium, Morphopolis immediately draws the player in with its beautiful illustrations. The background music is relaxing, and the play style is unhurried. I particularly enjoyed the immersion aspect, and wished the game was longer. Perhaps new chapters will be released as upgrades (hint hint). The puzzles, are simplistic compared to the gold standard of the Myst/Riven series, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Initially, I ran into a bug at Level 4, but the devs were lightening quick to respond and equally as quick to fix it. Impressive. They were also very helpful in tactfully pointing out a user error -- mine.  The colors are beautiful, the illustrations transport one into an interesting and inviting world, the music is lovely, the puzzles fun and challenging enough to keep it interesting but not so much so that you need a notebook and a 'bang head here' sign next to your monitor. Great game to enjoy alone, or together with your kiddos who are of an age to enjoy hidden object activities. Looking forward to more!!			"

												Morphopolis sets you in an arty world, above and underground, where you'll take control of different kinds of insects over the course of five stages. Essentially, this is an object finder and puzzles game. During the course of the game you'll come across particular creatures and plants populating the beautifully stylized art work and consistent backdrops. You lead your character, or bug that is, through a terrain of sticks, leaves and otherwise organic world to find hidden objects and to solve puzzles. This in turn enables you to progress to the succeeding stages. The surreal and picturesque environments are well complimented by a soothing soundtrack and the game itself is just very immersive and enjoyable.While the puzzles are not frustratingly difficult to solve and the hidden objects not obscenely obscured, it is a casual puzzle game for fans of the artistic type.

												TL;DR: A casual and pretty short but nice hidden object adventure with a bug theme.The first thing you notice with Morphopolis is that it is extremely colourful. The screen is full of mesmerizing plants, leaves, branches and bugs. A relaxing string-music is playing on the background. Because of all the colours it is initially difficult to focus: what am I looking at exactly?It turns out you are a caterpillar. Crawling around (using mouse) feels slow and wonky, but you'll get used to it. A cursor appears and instructs you to crawl and click on objects. Surprise, it's a hidden object game, the casual version of adventure genre! Every one of the five levels has several different things to find, some of which only trigger if you go near them and use your bug magic (by clicking the bug).Some stuff is difficult to make out of the background while others are very easy to spot. Finding stuff gives you power to influence other bugs or plants. This way you'll open paths to other areas. Your ultimate purpose is to morph into a greater being bug.Occasionally, once a level or so, a puzzle is triggered. Simple puzzles require arranging seeds in the right order, deducing perfect shapes or rebuilding scenes. Most of them are relaxing and simple enough though a couple of them were even pretty challenging.Finding stuff can be a pain because of the bright-coloured scenery. Never fear, as mercifully there's an in-game hint system that shows you where the elusive stuff is hiding. True to the casual theme, there's no punishment whatsoever for using it - you just have to wait a bit for it to cool-down to use it again.Two and half hours later I had completed the game. It was perhaps a little short and scarce on content for the price. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience and also a relaxing write, idling in-game waiting for the last couple of card drops and listening to the music. Get Morphopolis if you don't shy away from puzzles but also wish to relax for a single evening.			"

												Morphopolis sets you in an arty world, above and underground, where you'll take control of different kinds of insects over the course of five stages. Essentially, this is an object finder and puzzles game. During the course of the game you'll come across particular creatures and plants populating the beautifully stylized art work and consistent backdrops. You lead your character, or bug that is, through a terrain of sticks, leaves and otherwise organic world to find hidden objects and to solve puzzles. This in turn enables you to progress to the succeeding stages. The surreal and picturesque environments are well complimented by a soothing soundtrack and the game itself is just very immersive and enjoyable.While the puzzles are not frustratingly difficult to solve and the hidden objects not obscenely obscured, it is a casual puzzle game for fans of the artistic type.

												Marvelous game and holy crap how could you not spend $0.25 on this gem. Its true the mouse controls can be a bit slow to respond and annoying at times but the the music, art and puzzles are what make this well worth the 1 or 2 of your time it takes to finish based on your puzzle prowness.  One I think must have solved due soley based on Murphy's Law.  Anyhow the music is stellar with its insect like stacatto beats and windchimey quality dancing off the crazy flora.  Not much story other than being a metaphormasizing insect peramedic.  Some of the puzzles are gruelly hard why other are just so beautiful and clever they will make you smile.  Dr. Seuss would definately approve this game.			"

												If you're into cerebral point-and-clickers in a vibrant atmosphere, look no further! Morphopolis delivers just that. You're taken into a short-lived adventure of 5 different insects trying to find shelter while scavenging through foliage for items and other insects while solving puzzles. Truly a unique gaming experience; however, I felt the game to be rather slow-paced and frustrating at times (e.g. the game's lack of surrounding area guidance and awkward controlling). That said, it was definitely worth the price of 2 quarters.Additionally, it might be worth taking a break once in a while since the color pallete of the background could prove overwhelming for one sitting. I got a mild headache after 45 minutes.Score:(4/5) for an Indie Game(5/5) for Achievement Hunters(1/5) for Replay ValueBonus:(5/5) for the Price			"

												Wonderful beautiful game. The music and art style are fantastic. It's fairly short - I beat it in less than two hours. But the achievements are impossible to miss, so it's an easy 100% completion on one playthrough. Some of the puzzles were challenging, and it took me a few minutes to get an idea for the play style (point and click adventure/puzzles). But I had never played anything like it before. 10/10 would recommend for a bug filled fun world.			"

												A 'hidden object' game blended with minor lateral thinking puzzles, Morphopolis is best summarised as a scavenger hunt within a living painting of the micro-scale insect world.  The interface is minimalistic--there is no options menu of which to speak and only a couple of pointing fingers at the very beginning will provide hints to start you on your way.  Perhaps in an effort to compel the player to savour the environment and explore it, objectives are kept vague and unintuitive, often discovered simply by frantically clicking all over the place until some unremarkable object triggers another collection quest.  It is not a failure--this hands-off approach of function and clear paths of progression does accomplish the task of encouraging exploration, but the developer was a little too loose with it.Despite these minor flaws, the music and art style are soothing and most of the puzzles, once discovered are simple enough to lend to that same tranquil atmosphere, and each challenge is varied enough to be equally as challenging as rewarding to complete.If you enjoy hidden object games, you may enjoy Morphopolis as a quick snack, but you'll quickly complete it and find yourself searching for more filling meals afterward.  Morphopolis is right for the price, given that it provides two or three hours of gameplay, and may be plucked for less than a dollar during most Steam sales, so I do recommend it if environmental and casual puzzles or scavenger hunts interest you.

												The game is beautiful and unique, I must admit. The artwork is curious and otherwordly, much like Jean Giraud's comics.It's pretty, VERY pretty, but not very enjoyable. It's basically a very slow paced hidden objects game that takes an hour or so to complete, if you can deal with the sluggish controls. I managed to complete the game because I was drunk and pretended I was a sportscaster in some sort of death match tournament that had only one confused insect participant.			"

												Very similar to The Tiny Bang Story, and I don't say refer to this as a negative aspect due to the fact that I really enjoyed TTBS. Basically you are an insect and each game's level represents a metamorphosis stage in the bug's life. The art style is amazing in Morphopolis and I really enjoyed it's concept. The gameplay is pretty similar to TTBS where you have to pick up certain items to have the chance to solve a certain puzzle. The hint system is well setup in a way that it cannot be overused and only utilized in a emergency situation. The game itself has 5 stages, and it's about two hours long. The soundtrack is very relaxing. I feel like I should have payed the full price, in order to motivate the developers to make more of this type of games, but instead I purchased Morphopolis for a ridiculous amount of 24 cents... Anyways, I naturally recommend Morphopolis for the point&click gamer.PS: It's one of those games you get all the achievements simply by beating the game.

The game is certainly cheap however it never justifies the time you spend with itThe game can be simulated by throwing a bucket of lego on the floor then trying to find all of a certain type of block while occasional someone stops you and 'Rewards' you with puzzles that wouldn't be out of place on one of those childs placemats you see in family restaurants.The game actively goes out of its way to make things last longer. Rather than clicking between screens you move an insect around preset paths in the artwork at a frustratingly slow pace. These paths are incredibly difficult to pick out so you just end up pushing your avatar in a direction to see if he can go that way or not. When the game inevitably asks you to back track you end up waiting a painful amount of time for what is little more than a screen change. In a baffling choice of design there is even a delay on the ""collection"" of items as they slowly move across the screen to your 'counter' before they are registered and allow progression.I know an awful lot of fuss has been made over the artwork of the game but I think it fails. When still every screen is a painting and certainly striking. However as an interactive medium there are hardly any subtle pointers of where you can go. Why can you climb here and not there? Because the game says so and thats it. Being able to find out where you are allowed to go let alone where you should go is simply a case of trial and error for the most part.			"

												This would be a very pleasant game, I love the artwork and the music. However, the awful gameplay ruins all the fun. First of all, one cannot save the game mid-level - if I cannot complete the level for whatever reason, my whole progress on it is gone, I have to start the level all over. Secondly, controls are very corny and counter-intuitive. Finally, the mini-games are not only hard (which is fair enough, obviously I have only my own mind to blame for that), but sometimes it's nearly impossible to figure out their objective in the first place. Do yourself a favour and buy a game by Amanita instead (Samorost series, Botanicula, Machinarium) - equally intricate art-wise and much better in gameplay department.			"

												I absolutely love this game. It's a must if you like puzzles. I played it through in one sitting.Gameplay: The game is a bit slow to start with, but after clicking around a bit, it's pretty easy to figure out the overall goals. You move through one insect body to the next (in each stage), clicking flowers and other insects along the way. You'll need to retrive things for them. Bringing items to the insects (usually) makes them move out of your way, while bringing items to the flowers (usually) results in puzzles with a much needed item granted after. The items are listed on the left of the screen after clicking on a bug/flower and a question mark in the top left gives hints; it will just make a noise if there's nothing you need to do on the current screen. The puzzles require a bit of fiddling with, but once you figure out what to do they're straightforward with just enough challenge.Controls: Just point and click/drag. Sometimes your bug will have a tiny bit of trouble figuring out if you want it to turn around or go up/down, but it's nothing major and adjusts quickly. Doesn't really affect gameplay.Achievements: If you play the game through, you'll get them all. They're awarded for milestones rather than special circumstances or secrets.Graphics: The graphics are gorgeous. Colorful and 2D, layered for depth. It makes it difficult to find what you're looking for sometimes, but in a good way. And not too difficult, unless you're colorblind; this seemed to give some of my friends trouble when they saw the game; they couldn't play it and didn't see most of the things I was trying to find. I'm rather in love with the art. It makes me glad there's an art appreciation pack available for purchase.Music: Simple, ambient instrumental melodies. I wish there was a soundtrack for the game.Replay: I think if enough time passed, I would be able to play it again. But with 5 stages and knowing all the puzzles/where to go, there's not much to be said for playing it over and over, unless you want to show off to your friends.Overall 10/10. Definitely worth $1.99!			"

The music and trippy artwork mixed with the fact that you're playing as a bug does something nice for a tired overworked brain.This is a mild puzzle game with no real instructions, but don't let that drive you off. It's actually really fun and the music is superb.You have to find your ""quests"" by clicking on the more interesting pieces of the scenery then once you've found all the required items (it counts down) you click on the completed item bubble and it'll show you ""who"" to turn it in to.This aspect of the game is very much like Where's Waldo. You have to look in the background to find your ""quest"" objects. Some will be easy and some will be tucked away. When your ""hero"" bug glows green you have to find what else is glowing green and try to sit on it.It's very short (if you're good at the puzzles about 2 hrs),  but worth it if you like Where's Waldo and medium difficulty puzzles.

												At the time of this review, the game is on sale for $0.19. Quick verdict: get it!Morphopolis is a hidden object game where you progress by collecting certain quantities of a specific object to fulfill an objective and proceed further in the level. The objects are hidden in the colorful backgrounds and you collect them by clicking on them. There are 5 levels, and aside from item collection, each level has a bug-themed puzzle to solve. Most are bland and predictable, but a couple stood out as creative.It doesn't do anything out of the ordinary, and is quite short (<2hrs), but on a sale it is a quite enjoyable way to unwind. Tip: Finding your path can unintiutive. Clicking on your bug sends out green balls towards all possible paths in your proximity.			"

												Very beautiful game with very detailed backgrounds. Although it's just a point-and-click game sometimes I would click somewhere and the character would just get stuck moving back and forth. The puzzles were the best part of the game since the rest of it was just collecting stuff. It'll entertain you for an hour or two, worth it for such a low price. If you can do that final puzzle without searching it up, I applaud you.			"

												Picked this game up for £0.15 and it's given me a nice 2 hours of gameplay.Gorgeous graphics and I enjoyed the point and click puzzle elements.The only frustrating bit is that the puzzles have no instructions and the hint button doesn't work when you are completing one so the first bit of many of the puzzles is clicking around the screen to try and get something to work. Also if you quit halfway through a level it doesn't save it for you.It's a nice game whilst it's on sale but I don't think I would have purchased it full price.			"

												Visually, this game is nice. Control and documentation/instructions, this game is not so good.I picked this up on sale for $0.19 USD during Steam Summer Sale 2015. The value of the entertainment provided is at least worth a dollar, so this was in my opinion a good value.This is basically a hidden object/click and find game with a few puzzles thrown in. There are 5 levels. A short game, but fun enough. The puzzles are a nice easy casual level. The hidden object portion is clunky. You usually have at least two different screens to look for your objects. Your insect starts in one corner of a screen, you click and hold to tell it where to go. You have a hint box in the upper right corner. You can use it if you get a bit lost. It takes time to replenish. The insect moves slow and the paths are not always clear/easy to navigate. You spend a lot of time going back and forth.Some of the puzzles are not so evident as far as what you're supposed to do. For example, there is a puzzle that is basically a peg game. You have a grid of objects with the center unoccupied. You need to jump one object over another to remove it from the grid. Repeat until you only have one object remaining. Pretty simple. The problem was that there were no instructions telling you how to do this. You need to click and hold then drag. Artifact of being a mobile app/game for a touch screen?The background music, is just that, background music. It's not an epic fighting game, it's a puzzle game, so the music is repetitive new age sounding instrumentals. Easy to ignore, but really, nothing bad.Overall, get it on sale and it's worth a few minutes of distraction.			"

												Take a break from those daunting, 100 hour RPG games for a quick, fairly enjoyable, somewhat atmospheric and artistically stimulating game about insects and nature. It's a hidden object game, essentially, with some progressively more difficult puzzle solving elements. The game itself will likely take a maximum of 2 hours to complete but is enjoyable for its low pricing. Not going to be a deep, thought provoking narrative, per se, but the raw feel of the minimal hand holding and discovery is enjoyable. The art style works well with the game's simplicity, and the idea of continuously going through a sort of metamorphosis through levels makes the game more interesting.My one qualm with the game is that as it seems to be designed for touch devices, clicking the direction to move is the only option rather than key input (which would seem somewhat more natural for this game).

												This game is going to bring you about 1-2 hours of enjoyment and some struggle for the brain. It dosen't tell you anything with text which makes the struggle harder than it could be, and all in all that works out for the better. It's not one of those games I feel like I'll ever get back to run again. But it has a lot going for it both in the musicscore and visually. It kindof feels like looking at and analysing a painting and suddenly the painting comes to life, take that and add on some puzzles that are tricky, but simple enough for anyone to figure them out. For the price I'd say it's really worth picking up, if not then look at a let's play of it so you can enjoy it that way.			"

												If you really had a hard day and do not want to play any dynamic stuff, this is just the game. A bit monotonous, with a soundtrack that gets stuck in your ear after a while, maybe a little tiring/boring, sometimes even a bit sinister. Slow movements, lots of insects. The visual style is rather interesting, through. Some puzzles may get you stuck, I struggled at least twice and had to consult a guide.Takes a couple of hours to finish all five levels. A game to walk through and put away forever. Not bad, not at all, but I wouldn't call it a gem.Just finished it and don't even know what else to say. Seems like I'm turning into an insect, too.

												Fun, casual puzzle game. The core gameplay can be described as a ""find the object"" or ""I, Spy"" game. You look for a number of items hidden in the 60's psychedelic album cover-esque background.                                   Mixed into that are various puzzles ranging from simple to difficult. So while the game is mostly laid back and casual there are some puzzles that will really test your abilities and may even require a guide.Some control/interface issues exist that sully the game a bit but ultimately I'd reccomend it, particurlary as part of the Art Aprecciation bundle.

												Morphopolis is a point-and-click adventure game that is both beautiful and unique; However its gameplay is slow,boring, and repetative while being relaxing at the same time. After thirty minutes of gameplay I wanted to stop, I was constantly wondering around playing I-Spy with the game. I would say that around 80% of this game is I-Spy with insanely slow movement. The other 20% is spent doing puzzles which were mostly unique and condusing. Overall I would say to only get this game while it's on sale just to see wheter you like it or not. If at full-price, then there is definitely something better to spend your money on.~Pros~+Beautiful Artwork+Unique Artwork+Unique Game Concept+Unique Puzzles+Casual Players Welcome+All Achievements Unlocked in only one Playthrough~Cons~-No Options  -No Controls  -No Audio  -No Video Options-Repetative Gameplay-Repetative Soundtrack-Two Hours of Gameplay -Extremely Slow Gameplay-Buggy Movement-Zero Turtorial or Instruction  -Confusing Gameplay-Only Auto-Saves after each chapter  -If you leave during a 45 minute chapter, you must restart-Can not quit during puzzles  -During puzzles you must manually make the game crash if you want to leave the game; However doing this will make you have to restart the entire chapter, including the puzzle~Verdict~  ~Only buy it if on sale for under a US Dollar  ~I would not recommend buying Morphopolis at the full price of Five US Dollars~That is all~  ~Indie Reviewer Soggy Banana~			"

												A nice short (depends on how fast you solve the puzzles) game with relaxing music and wonderfully drawn scenes. I would say it is a relaxing game, but the insects you play walk are very slow paced. This can be really annoying (and thus no longer relaxing) as you will often know where certain objects are hidden but cannot collect them yet because you have to wait for your insect to catch up with your desperate mouse-clicking.Aside from the last puzzle the puzzles are not easy, but do-able if you think about them for a bit. The last puzzle is quite hard and to be honest I don't think I'd like to try my hand at it again. It was quite frustrating.All in all a really nice game which I can only recommend if you're looking for something casual.			"

												This game is beautiful. The art is beautiful, the sound is beautiful. It's a beautiful game. It was clearly made by artists, and talented ones at that.Sadly, aritsts do not always make the best game designers. The controls are awkward and confusing, movement is painfully slow and difficult to control, and there are times when a little guidance would be helpful - but none is offered. I'm thinking in particular of one puzzle where the pieces can only be moved as they are in those peg solitaire games - but there is absolutely no indication given of this. There's a whole forum thread full of people wondering why they can't do anything in this puzzle, assuming it's a bug. Difficulty is good, but obtuseness is... less good. Given how many ""alpha testers"" they list on their credits, I'd have expected them to realize and repair some of these large flawsStill, it's quite short, and as I said, it's very beautiful. At the extremely steep discount it regularly goes for on Steam, I'd say it's worth one play through. If nothing else, it's got trading cards. So I'm recommending it - at a discounted price. I'd like to see more from this developer, but I'd like to see these brilliant artists team up with someone who knows how to design a game.			"

												Visually fascinating, with some brilliant sound design, this is an immersive lush world to get lost into for an hour or two, surreal and unsettling yet soothing at the same time. It's a game allright, but it's really not about the gameplay, that's just a superficial excuse to spend some time in this eery atmosphere.Stripped of its artstyle this would be a mediocre HOG, with some of the most unimaginative puzzles ever. Worse even, the controls are really bad - though it gets less noticeable after the first level (stick it out). Basically, translating the (clearly originally for touchscreens) tap / drag into click / click&drag means the game can't really tell what your input is half the time, which will be quite frustrating for some people.Personally, I wanted to be annoyed by another half baked mobile port and couldn't, and I don't even like insects and flowers that much. It looks stunning on a big screen, the images here hardly do it justice. The music and sound design have the same eerie, mildly unsettling quality as the visuals. The loving attention to detail in both the art and the sound design is really impressive, as is the way they blend and flow together, completely overshadowing everything the gameplay is lacking. I also found the slow pace and even the length (it's short) fitting and appropriate. I enjoyed my time with it, and for anyone after the experience rather than the game, it's definitely worth checking out.			"

												Interesting concept of the game. Hidden object is the most accurate description, but it certainly isn't a standard game from that genre. There is no story and still you can follow the 'plot' pretty easily.The presentation is unique and the music fits the atmosphere nicely. The animations aren't perfect, but again fit the style of the game very well. The controls aren't that great and guessing where to go and/or how to get there can be a bit frustrating. The controls just work well enough to finish the game, but you will run into some problems with them.Another small issue is that you have to move between screens and it is awfully slow. It's a design decision to include this 'mechanic' into the game, but I don't think that it works particularly well. Still it only slows the rather short game down, so it's really not much of an issue.Is the game worth to play? Yes. Is it worth 5$? Well, no. It is quite short and offers no replay value, so get it in a sale or from a bundle. That being said try to get in the next proper sale, as it is a worthwhile experience :)			"

												I received this game as a gift from a good friend.At its heart, Morphopolis plays like a hidden object game with several simple, yet fun puzzles thrown in.The artwork is quite charming, bright and colorful. It would be at home in classic illustrated children's book.If I had one gripe about gameplay is that there is a point and click element to the movement (or more correctly, hold a direction and click) which is quite slow and sometimes it's not obvious what areas of the screen transition to a new area. That said you can at least click on your little bug several times to send out little 'feeler' particles that branch off in the different directions you can move to, although you may have to be much closer than you'd think for this to show you a path you've been missing.It has a simple hint system, clicking the ? in the upper right hand corner will have the game point out an object you can interact with at the time. It has a cool down timer after use, so it's not really abusable. If you've found all there is to do in an area it will simply beep instead of pointing out something, however it still wont tell you where you should go, which again can be a little annoying if you've missed an area transition.The game is short and can be beaten in under two hours, I played it in several short bursts over a couple of days. It may take you longer if you're farming trading cards.Over all, Morphopolis feels like it was aimed at a younger audience. I'd highly recommend it to anyone with child or young adult interested in entomology (the study of insects.) Those who have a marked phobia of insects however, might find the game a little creepy (and crawly).			"

												It is very short, simple and cute hidden objects game.Main characters there are insects. From level to level you just should find some stuff for pave the way further or help your folks. Also you will find there different kinds of puzzles, which can solve even kids.Music and locations in this game are wonderful and plunge you in atmosphere of world of insects.If you like what you saw and heard in trailer - you definitely must buy this game, because there is nothing, except this brilliant graphic, music and simple puzzles, which dont take a lot of time. Enjoy it!			"

Feeling too squeezed to write some nice review so I'll just say it's a very strange game but you'll love it's awesome visuals. And hate that last puzzle lol.			"

 Short review: Morphopolis is beautiful, but it is lacking. I'm glad it's short because otherwise it would be repetitive. The puzzles are as beautiful as the game, but as repetitive as the same could become - for anyone who is into puzzles will have seen those same puzzles before.I recommend this game to be bought on sale. Casual gamers, puzzlers, art enthusiasts and patient people should be fond of this gem.The music is relaxing and beautiful, so headphones are surely recommended.			"

												This is a uniquely beautiful, wordless, hidden object game that focuses on insects.  You guide a variety of insects through five scenarios, collecting body parts and seeds and interacting with other bugs and plants. The movement speed is really slow, but that's the only knock I have. The puzzles are creative and challenging without being overly difficult, and the music, although limited, is very enjoyable.  But the big thing is the graphics - they are very unique in their coloration and style and that makes all the impact.  The game takes a little over an hour for the five scenarios, so it's short but sweet.  Definitely in the category of games as art, with interaction taking a back seat to aesthetics, but still worth the experience.			"

												Morphopolis is a really pretty game, but unfortunately it is barely playable.For a click-and-find type of adventure -- pretty mindless, for the most part -- it is pretty interesting. I bought it (on sale) due to my interest in the graphics, and I wasn't disappointed by them. However, I was disappointed by the gameplay itself. The click-and-drag meant I was constantly putting pressure on my mouse and it got uncomfortable -- it could be made better by utilizing a ""tap-to-move"" function. Further, it was very slow-moving and the insect seemed to get ""confused"", direction-wise, making it even more of a hassle to move around. The only part of this game that I did really enjoy was the puzzle parts. They were clever, it was fun having no instructions so you just kind of had to figure them out, and they were a welcome break from the otherwise monotonous game.Unfortunately, the puzzles themselves are not enough for me to recommend this game. If you're looking to buy a pretty game that's also pretty dysfunctional, then look no further; however, if you want a game that you can actually play for fun more than once, I'd definitely look elsewhere.

												When I first entered Morphopolis, I found myself inside a painting. Gentle background music embraced me, and I felt safe. This game is a soothing emotional experience. It's about forgetting all your troubles and let yourself immerse in the colors, in the heart-warming atmosphere.More on a technical side, Morphopolis is a 'hidden object' game, where you need to look around to find all the items from a list... and resolve puzzles.It's one of those sweet, slow-paced relaxing games to play before bed, sipping a cup of tea.Oh and it's only 0.99 Euro.

												(Review writed with 2 hours gaming and all achievements unlocked - Dec 26th, 2015).Morphopolis let you control of various insects over the course of five stages solving puzzles so that you may progress. You lead your bug down the paths, clicking on the eggs, flowers, and disembodied grasshopper legs hidden in the busy, detailed environments until you collect the prescribed number. Pros:- Looks great;Cons:	- Strange/Slow gameplay;- Few levels;- Very easy to solve the puzzles;- Boring challenges.5,0/10.			"

												I was originally drawn in by Morphopolis's vibrant, hand-drawn art. It's color palettes are rich, the environments are complex, and its cast of flora is so lush it almost borders on surreal. It is, without a doubt, one of the most visually stunning hidden object games that I've played  to date.Unfortunately, those stunning visuals make for unclear level layouts and hidden objects that are almost indecipherable from the scenery. The game's graphic elements encourage rampant clicking and inspire frustration in the player when they suddenly discover there's a whole new area they would have known they could explore if they had just climbed up one particular branch (that is, of course, identical to all the other branches that you can't climb). Many of the levels were aesthetically pleasing, but irritatingly busy.The biggest flaw in Morphopolis, however, is the movement speed of your character. Your bug crawls at an agonizingly slow pace and is often confused by the clicks of your mouse, causing them to ""dance"" back and forth wildly. On top of that, despite being able to spot many hidden objects as you advance through the screens of the level, you can't collect them until you've received a task from another bug. The game forces you to walk back and forth several more times than necessary to collect items you already knew were there.If you can get it for cheap and are a fan of hidden object games I would pick it up just for the art, but otherwise there are more polished hidden object games to spend your time and money on in the Steam store that are guaranteed to give you more fun than the slow, trudging pace of Morphopolis.

												This is a welcoming, Eye-Spy kind of game, set in a colouful and beautiful reimagining of the insect world. It is very attractive, fun, but it has a few annoying aspects.It has a very attractive art style, which appears to be hand-drawn, and is very colourful. This art style is very calming, and is accompanied by nice, atmosphereic music. The colour palette used is very outlandish and unique, which gives the feeling of an almost alien world, this lines up well with the oddities of the insect world.Morphopolis is not only very beautiful, but it is quite enjoyable. The gameplay is that of the Eye-Spy concept, of needing to find objects, on a list, that appear to blend in with the environment or that are crowded by a whole lot of other objects. This is a very calming gameplay mechanic, which is well used in the game, especially because the objects you need to find blend in well with the evironment, making it a slight challenge to find, but not too hard, just enough to be relaxing. This game mechanic not only helps the game to be relaxing, but it also compliments the colourful art in the game, as it makes you observe and appreciate the background art more. The gameplay is not just Eye-Spy, but is also various puzzles, these puzzles range in difficulty, they are all possible though, and if confusion sets in, it only takes a few minutes to figure out what exactly you need to do, and if you can not work it out, it's easy enough to just click spam everything until it is solved.There are a few annoying things about this game, that are deal-breakers for some. The insects in your control move slowly, mainly because they are insects, and the game requires you to move to different screens back and forth, which can be tedious, but if you were an optimist, you could say it helps you to relax and appreciate the art more? The game has some very vague insturctions, which can ake progressing hard. The game does have a hint system, but the hint system can't help with everything. It is suggested that you have a walkthrough handy, just in case you are unsure what to do next, as it might happen.Morphopolis is very worth buying. It is quite short, but it is an experience that is worthwhile. Worthwhile for it's art style, for it's gameplay, and for its achievements.			"

												Nice short game if you're into hidden objects in a beautiful environment (check if you like it with screenshots, I really enjoyed it) and puzzles (although there aren't that many). Music and art are nice, and objects are never hidden to the point where it becomes unpleasant, the only con I found is that one puzzle wasn't reactive enough for me to get its rules intuitivly, which is a little bit frustrating, but it happened only once and because I wasn't used to that puzzle. Puzzles aren't that original or difficult, though they are nice and not without any challenge (you won't either spend hours on any). I think it should take between 1 or 2 hours to finish without pause, so it's just a short nice experience.			"

												This game is a hidden-object game. I have to say, I love how it looks. The sceneries are amazing and look so idyllic. The music fits perfectly to the graphics and creates an incredible atmosphere. The puzzles are not too difficult, sometimes it's just difficult to find all the objects, as everything is so colourful, but with the quotationmark button in the right top corner, everything is much easier when you are stuck.I would have loved to get some instructions in the beginning of the game, because I felt quite helpless and clueless because you get not tutorial or some hints on how what works.But after one or two puzzles it's not that bad anylonger. All in all I would give 4 out of 5 stars. Not full, because of the missing tutorial which i really would have liked to have (as the game is so short it takes away a lot of play time, just to find out how you do stuff).			"

So it might take a while for you to understand what you have to do when you open one of the puzzles. Trust me, it will put your mind to the test. You'll soon realize that each stage somewhat tells a story if you look deep into it. And it all sums up to a quite open ending which i'm a little dissatisfied at. Please make a sequel!

												Beautiful game, with very clever hidden objects and puzzles.   Very minimal interface, both in terms of dashboard and control (everything is a mouse-click), which made one of the puzzles a little impenetrable and, occasionally, navigation a little quirky.The game is quite short, but definitely worth a go at such a low price (I bought it in the Christmas sale).

												This game should bring back nostalgic memories for everyone who grew up with educational cd-rom games in the 90s. This is basically one of those - with juvenile puzzles, pastel colors, and a theme teaching children about death and nihilism. The hidden objects parts are as boring as they were when Carmen disappeared and incredibly enough the puzzles are about as evolved, consisting of a matching game, a pattern game, and so on. But still, it’s clearly designed either by or for kids and it’s about a bug’s pointless struggle for metamorphosis, only to finally be allowed to die. Fantastic. Nature wins again.			"

												Wow, what an amazing game! I just bought Morphopolis today, it was very cheap on sale and the game was an amazing experience. You play as an insect and you have to salvage other insects that are dead or almost dead, not quite sure about that. To do so you have to solve puzzles. Most of them are easy except the very last one. Beautiful graphics, nice music and the fact that the game does not guide you is a plus in this case. This games makes it fun to find out what you have to do. But you need a little patience. Morphopolis is not for restless players. And it's short, you can finish the game in about 2.5 hours.			"

												Well, I've never had so much fun playing with bugs!!  I really enjoyed and only needed youtube once and that was only because although I was moving in the right direction, my bug was not!  Anyway, for most puzzelers I would say it is a slight distraction.  For me it took a little bit longer.  Yeah, I liked it a lot since it's the first time I have ever actually ever finished a game on Steam :P			"

												Beautiful hand-drawn art, combined with melancholic music and atmosphere, and a mix of HOPA and point & click gameplay with a little bit of puzzle games, creates one great game.Sure, there are some minor flaws (like clumsy movements, slow moving from one scene to another and lack of save game during levels), but they still can't ruin this little gem.

												A simple point and click adventure where your goal is to infest a deceased organism larger than yourself. Once you infest the creature you're able to control it and the cycle begins again... as the cycles continue you become the russian nesting doll of parasites... continually collecting resources and infesting more powerful creatures. For what purpose, we may never know, for we are only given a small glimpse into this creature's existence.I give it two thumbs up with high praise of this game's warning to humanity of the evil to come.It's adaptable. It can solve complex puzzles. It bends other creatures to it's will. We're the only ones that know it's coming. We must stop it.			"

												I wish there was a meh button. Although this game is short its normal price is 1.99, I bought it during a steam sale at a much reduced price, and since I paid less than a quarter I think it lived up to how much I paid. This games doesn't do much hand holding, and its a sort of point and click (more like slide and fumble). Simple story with pretty decent music (which does get to be repetitive after a while) and coloring book style . I would almost recommend it for kids except controling the insect can be frustrating when you can't see the paths availble holding down the mouse right button will show you possible paths and the right button uses your ability. After you know where the things you need and how to solve the puzzels there is little reason to replay this game. Becuase of its price I would recommend this game for people who like simple stories and point and clicks (together)			"

												Stunning Graphic/Artworks , and the BGM is marvellous .Definitely worth every penny , plus I bought it on Summer Sale (96% yo) ...definetely makes my day :DMorphopolis is a game about bugs, some of the smallest creatures in the world and they are rather fascinating and very important to our environment aswell. This game is a point and click game with puzzles to solve and hidden objects to discover and find, this will help the small bug on its journey of life. This is a very pretty and colourful game, and not very difficult to play.Also you must complete each chapter, if you decide to stop halfway through you will have to start from the beginning of that chapter, as there is no exit feature while in a level so I just completed them and exited the game afterwards.Morphopolis is a very short game and the achievements are easy to earn. I found the last puzzle rather challenging, but I won't doubt that anyone can't managed to solve it and get 100% of theachievements :)			"

												This game is beautiful!  The artwork is amazing and vibrant!  The insect movement is smooth and the music is really soothing.  The puzzles are pretty easy up until the very last one.  It took me about 30 minutes to finish... I knew what needed to be done, but I couldnt make my brain see it.  In the end it was a matter of luck.  I dont count that against the game at all... it really made me feel like I had accomplished something.  I recommend this game if you like soothing hidden object games with a bit of puzzle element thrown in.			"

												Morphopolis is a sadistic puzzle game, in which you control the movements of a specimen from the next level of insect evolution. This insect tracks down notably larger dying insects, then patches them up and feeds them, pretends to be their friend. But as soon as the larger insect is healed and ready to move again, the one you control penetrates it's head, burrows it's way inside the poor insects' brain cavity and takes control over their body. Afterwards, you begin to track down the next pray whom to repeat the process on.The game ends in you going inside a tunnel. It is understandable that the developers cut out the following part in which you take over a human, go lay your eggs in the newborn wing of a hospital and watch your children taking control of the newborn humans, and eventually, your race turning every other specie on the planet to mindless controllable puppets.Not recommended for underage audiences.

												One of the most visually stimulating puzzle games I've ever played. The puzzles vary in difficulty, most can be completed quickly but a few of the more challenging ones can take a while. For me the illustration style of this game combined with the music earns a 10/10 rating. Short but quite satisfying. For 19 cents during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale, I consider it a steal, not sure if I'd pay $4.99 for it though.			"

												Morphopolis is a non-traditional hidden object adventure that is more about mood, balance, and aesthetics than your more garden variety story and character driven gaming experience.  Artwork and innovation are its strong points from the beautifully hand drawn look to the unusual tasks you go about setting nature right.  Although slightly frustrating controls and sorely lacking tutorials make the game a little confusing at points, it is still a development achievement in its own right.  I recommend Morphopolist for it for someone who wants to try something unusual and those who are diehard adventure completionists, while those who are easily frustrated or confused should stay clear.

												Morphopolis Review - Raymond KTOne of the most relaxing, short but cheap indie games I have ever played. It has a beautiful art design and the music is exactly what you need for this type of game. It's not a particularly hard game, maybe you get stuck once or twice but overall it's a relaxing and fun experience. I enjoyed Morphopolis. It's a casual game, where you solve puzzles and find hidden items within the vibrant magnified insect world (kindof like ""A Bug's Life"") . The music is very good - soothing. (My wife wanted the sountrack - so we looked up the composer online). I enjoyed the artwork also - visually the game is pleasing to look at. It's not a particularly hard game - maybe 1 or 2 puzzles that might cause you to think a bit, but overall it's more of an engaging but pleasant and relaxing experience. The controls caused me to get stuck once or twice (there's a puzzle on level 4 where alot of players, like myself, seem to get to and think the game isn't responding because feedback is lacking - but it's a jumping game like checkers). Overall, the game is engaging and doesn't overstay it's welcome. I enjoyed it!			"

												Beautiful and charming small puzzle game. I've really enjoyed the calming trip through five maps, full of very detailed, wonderful handdrawn art and hypnotic music, In terms of gameplay this is mostly a hidden object game, with some classic sliding puzzles here and there, varying from easy to tricky. The sometimes troublesome controls, double walking pathes and the lack of real originality in puzzles could weaken my overall very positive impression, but somehow they don't do and I'm sure I will replay this at some point!7/10			"

												Morphopolis is a stunningly beautiful point and click/hidden object game. Now I usually have some dislike towards hidden object games, but the style presented within Morphopolis makes up for that.There really is no story in Morphopolis. You are an insect who goes through several metamorphic changes. However Morphopolis should not be played for the story. It should be played for the atmosphere. Adding to the very colourful and fantastical world is the soundtrack. Now even though the soundtrack is not quite remarkable or rememberable, it does add to the atmosphere.As with many puzzle games, the learning curve is important. The puzzles within Morphopolis are common throughout the genre. Thus, being common, they are fairly easy, with the last one being the most difficult. That is great for the learning curve, however Morphopolis does not have any creative or new puzzles, which are always welcome in a point and click game. Another flaw is that you move incredibly slowly throughout the level, and if you miss something and have to back track it becomes tedious.With all that being said, Morphopolis is a colourful world on a bare bones hidden object/point and click game. If you want a casual and bright experience, I would pick up Morphopolis on sale as part of the Art Appreciation Pack. "

												If you are wondering what this game is, it's a ""Find the object"" and Puzzle game mostly. The graphics are this nice hand drawn kinda look, the music is a good soothing asian sounding track, and the sound effects are horrid when you have to hear them. The controlles are pretty akward moving your ""Player"" by dragging the mouse but you get used to it. The ""Find the object"" part of the game is drop dead simple and the puzzles are sometimes easy and sometimes pretty hard but the WORST part about them is they will time-out after a certain amount of time and just say you did it and give you the achievement -_-  The worst part about the game is its lack of any instuctions at all, some of the puzzles they put in your face with no explanation of what the goal is at all and it's not always obvious. I also wonder about when you repeatedly chick on your character, it makes noise and little balls go everywhere which seemingly does nothing and dropped my FPS from 60 to 22 if you can click fast enough to produce many little balls (With two 7870s, yeah seriously). 100% completion time was 1.5hours. I am only recommending this game because I got it on sale for $0.19 TOTAL and got 3 card drops from it, 1 being a HALO worth $0.19, haha... I wouldn't spend more than $1 or $2 on this game if your looking to buy it.			"

												Morphopolis is a game of transforming into a higher being. An art game at its core Morphopolis tells the tale of a caterpillar who transforms into the insect god. Since this is an art game the meaning of it can differ from person to person. I interpreted it as the rags to riches tale of a business, as you go further up the food chain the puzzles get longer and larger which can relate to financial problems from being a start up to being a corporation. As you ascend the food chain you are greeted by a very smooth and calming song which complements the artistic coloring of the scenery. While the animations and controls were a bit funky at times I found them to be only slightly detracting from the overall experience. With the colorful scenery and the swell music playing I found it hard to figure out what I was doing and why I was doing it. All I knew was that there were puzzles to be solved and levels to progress. Thankfully while searching for everything I needed to get to the next step, whenever I would not know what to do, the help button saved me from going into a frustration based rage. Like many puzzle games before it, the Help button only shows one thing hidden in the scene or one thing you have to click on to get the mission from. Unlike many other games you cannot abuse the help button. If you need help the game will show you one thing in the scene that is needed to continue and then it goes on cooldown for the next 30 seconds.While the help button is present while on the scavenger hunt portion of the game, the puzzle part does not include a help button. For two of the puzzles I had to read the walkthrough to simply understand what I needed to do. Once I figured out what to do the puzzles still possessed a challenge. Though some puzzles are drop dead easy and others are fairly hard, I got through each of them in under five minutes. Overall, enjoyed playing through Morphopolis and I recommend it to any gamer who likes to play puzzle games, scavenger hunt games, and art games. While I know this game isn't for everybody I recommend giving it a try for the overall gametime is only about an hour.My price tag for this game is a solid $7.00, the music and the scenery were enough to carry the game through the occasional slow part and it was not very difficult overall making this game a pleasurable game to play when you have an hour to kill. While this game does not possess a lot of replay value, it is worth it for the single play through.Score: 68/100			"

												There is one very frustrating thing about this game: each level consists of multiple screens, and to move to another screen you have to tell an insect to walk there. However he walks very slowly and always goes the wrong way if you don't click/drag exactly right, so you have to wait 10 seconds for the game to scroll to the next screen before you gain control and tell him to go back again. Very frustrating.Otherwise, it's a good but pretty short hidden object game with puzzles. The puzzles are not that difficult but it is not immediately clear what you have to do in each one. The last puzzle was relatively hard.			"

												Morphopolis is a puzzle game mixed with a point and click hidden object genre. It's casual and slow paced, yet redeems itself with the artistic choices and atmosphere it has. The scenery on every screen is packed with details and every environment is unique, same goes for the puzzles - every puzzle is based on it's own theme, and plays completely different from each other.The only dealbreaking issue is how the game controls and how cheaply it's ported to the PC. First of all, there are no settings for the game whatsoever - no resolution or windowed mode, sound, or control adjustments. Second of all, since the game is intended to run on a tablet, everything is done through on-screen UI, the keyboard is completely useless and the controls are limited to mouse movement and left click, even the pause menu isn't mapped to the ESC key as a common courtesy.  As a result, character movement is nearly broken, the puzzle controls are heavy and deliberate, as one would use the tablet.Additionally the game does deal with a lot of death, including, but not limited, to collecting, reanimating and essentially playing a puzzle game with a multitude of corpses. Collecting dismembered or torn limbs from fallen insects is also a reoccuring theme, which isn't necessarily an issue, but can be seen as more brutal than expected.The game lasted me only 3 hours, but it's worth for the experience.

												Morphopolis is a stunningly beautiful point and click/hidden object game. Now I usually have some dislike towards hidden object games, but the style presented within Morphopolis makes up for that.There really is no story in Morphopolis. You are an insect who goes through several metamorphic changes. However Morphopolis should not be played for the story. It should be played for the atmosphere. Adding to the very colourful and fantastical world is the soundtrack. Now even though the soundtrack is not quite remarkable or rememberable, it does add to the atmosphere.As with many puzzle games, the learning curve is important. The puzzles within Morphopolis are common throughout the genre. Thus, being common, they are fairly easy, with the last one being the most difficult. That is great for the learning curve, however Morphopolis does not have any creative or new puzzles, which are always welcome in a point and click game. Another flaw is that you move incredibly slowly throughout the level, and if you miss something and have to back track it becomes tedious.With all that being said, Morphopolis is a colourful world on a bare bones hidden object/point and click game. If you want a casual and bright experience, I would pick up Morphopolis on sale as part of the Art Appreciation Pack. "

												Your bug moves so very slowly across the screenn and you have to keep the left mouse button held down the entire time.  Besides that, most of the game is just finding hidden objects.  There is only one puzzle that requires any thought at all and it is the very last puzzle of the game.  The good parts are the hand drawn backgrounds and that one puzzle at the end, and I don't think they outweigh the annoyance of the controls.			"

												Morphopolis is an ""art game"" if ever there was one.  I say that because I believe for this particular game the art is the priority.  That's not to say there isn't interaction but its gameplay is quite simple.  I'd go as far to say that the gameplay is designed to make sure you focus on and absorb the art.  The eye candy is nice but it takes more then that to design a good game.In Morphopolis you play as different bugs who are kind enough to help out there neighbors with different chores.   Then at the end of each stage it appears you transfer yourself into a larger bug whom you'll play as in the following stage.  There isn't any written story instead the game leaves it up to you to interrupt the meaning behind you're actions.  Even beyond story-telling there isn't even guides to tell you where to go or what to do.  Restricted movement and actions is enough to let you figure out for yourself what you need to accomplish.This game is super stylized.  The consistency of the art work between each stage is spot on.  The stages split across multiple screens which connect seamlessly.  The art is this Morphopolis is stunning.  The paintings are incredible and make you really focus when trying to find the objects you need.  You'll be looking at every little detail as your eyes slowly inspect the image.Essentially, this is a find the objects game.  As you play you'll come across particular plants and bugs that stick out from the backgrounds.  Each of them will ask you to find a set amount of particular items for them.  You'll need to carefully scan the backgrounds and gather up all the items.  Then proceed to deliver them in order to clear a path or initiate a special mini-game puzzle.  All the puzzles are very different and I believe this is were Morphopolis loses it consistency.  Until this point the game is fairly easy and relaxing but a couple of the puzzles are incredibly challenging.  This very bizarre difficulty curve takes you out of what is otherwise an immersive and enjoyable game.Very stylized and original, the only thing holding this game back from is it's struggle balancing.  If you think this might be a game you'll enjoy don't let that hold you back.  That being said I'm sure some people will really enjoy that added challenge.  Those who are worried about getting frustrated can always minimize the game a bring up walk-through for the really tough puzzles.  As I said before art is at the core of this game.  This is an array of visual stimulation that will let you relax and lose yourself in the world.  Look else where for a more interactive and more traditional ""game like"" experience.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Point and click hidden object game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThe game has no options.You can't change the resolution size.About the game.You have to find the hidden objects and click them. Sometimes you have to solve puzzles too.There is not much things about to be said, it's just a basic point and click game. Graphics are alright and well drawn. Music is calm but could be a bit repetitive. You don't get any help during puzzles and there is no tutorial. The game is not that extremely long aswell. it has like 5 levels or so. You have to use the backgrounds sometimes to move to a different area. Which could be overlooked. I think the game is nice, idea is nice - it's a bit short. There is no tutorial.There is a help system.Music is calming but loud?Graphics are nicely drawn.Other things.You could be like ""ok, wtf do i have to do now?""-------------------I Give this game a 7/10 "

												A gorgeous little time-waster of a game. Art is lush and vibrant; excellent hand-drawn work. The music is soothing and very ""zen"". Gameplay progresses slowly in that you need to move your insect to and fro different screens and the movement process does get a little clunky, yet the slow and relaxing pace of the game compounds with the superb art and music to create a game that all in all is an excellent choice for unwinding and resting to. Very rejuvenating.Puzzles scattered throughout the game's five stages ensure that you need to at least think and brainstorm a bit to progress. While the lack of instructions can be confusing, once figured out the puzzles are novel and well-designed adaptations of widely-known brain teasers a la beautiful artwork.In summary a fine point-and-click game for relaxing to, yet puzzles make sure that you at least work your brain a little. Recommended for anyone in need of a time killer; if not convinced due to the price just know that you are paying for some of the most beautiful art you will ever see in a game. :)			"

												Pretty, bordering on the surreal. Enchanting music. No tutorial, you just need to figure out things for yourself.The game is a cross between an art project, a point and click adventure, and a hidden object game, as you take your insect on a journey through 5 levels of undergrowth. The puzzles fit the theme, and while some are easy, others are trickier due to no instructions. The final puzzle made me rip my hair out before I finally managed it.The game is short, at just around 2 hours, but the price is unbeatable. At full price, it's worth it, but you can usually pick it up for just a few cents. At the time of writing, it's only 24 cents! It makes it worth buying just to try it, even if you don't think you'll like it.Recommended!			"

This short game (~2hrs) has 5 levels with puzzles and brainteasers, but what stands out is the beautiful art, a nice soundtrack and its minimalistic style in general. No instructions or texts are given at all, you have to figure out everything by yourself exploring the world with your bug. Very reccomended at this price.			"

												I had bought this game on sale for like 15 cents. I beat it, and got all achievements, and all cards. I sold those cards for like 20 cents in total. This game pays for itself.But I really enjoyed the relaxing music and easy game play. Some of the puzzles were a little hard, but were possible to beat. I beat it in under an hour, but liked it so much that I played it multiple times. If you ever wanted to see the life cycle of a bug, this is your chance.

												While the game is very pretty, it's also rather frustrating. The controls are wonky and I only knew what I was doing about 20% of the time. Direction is pretty lacking, the hint button is useless, and I had to google how to interact with the puzzles multiple times. Player speed made the game drag on and on.

												Game is intesresting and can be fun, but a few major problems made it tedious. Movement is WAAAAY too slow. Puzzles don't have any directions as to what they are oor how they work, so it becomes an exercise in clicking around the screen until something happens. I got this for 19 cents and can only recommend this game if you get it at the same price. Otherwise, not worth it.			"

And then it ends with what's basically a rubix cube that quits after a while when you don't solve it, and a glitch that doesn't let you end the game, until it fades to black for no f**king reason and then it's over.

												Morphopolis is a refreshing and relaxing experience, and truly a STUNNING visual masterpiece.Not really difficult, the game can be completed in less than two hours. Short, for sure, however still a good experience, and worth its price especially since it doesn't costs much.There are two types of gameplay in Morphopolis. The first is a point-n'click, where you explore the wonderful backgrounds looking for whatever can be useful. You'll soon have a to-gather list of differents items to use on a particular thing (a bigger bug than yours, a flower...) which will either open you a new path or open a puzzle minigame.These puzzles are the second part of Morphopolis and are as various as a visual memory game, an audio memory game, a ""classic"" puzzle, a mix-n'-match logical puzzle, and so on.There are two puzzles per level, and five levels in total.The moving system could have been more intuitive and will make you grunt sometimes (by example when you want to go somewhere and end on another panel), but is finally no big deal.The only really annoying thing is that the game doesn't allows you to save your progression while you're in a level, forcing you to restart from scratch the next time.Not the game of the year, but a nicely breath of fresh air.Just avoid it if even 2D bugs make you feel uneasy.

												Lukewarm recommendation, at the price I got it for (25 cents), and even then I'm not sure it's worth the time. At full price it's a waste of money, but at least it has cards and achievements.It's mostly a simple hidden object game and fetch quest, with a few low-rent common puzzles (pipe, jigsaw, slider, etc) that have been seen a million times to draw out the game time. For the most part, the hidden objects are blatant, but I had trouble with some green ones given that there's just so much green everywhere. I didn't see anything original anywhere.It's somewhat pretty, in a 1998 Newgrounds original sort of way, but it certainly isn't awe-inspiring art. Its Flash roots are very obvious. The music is good, in an unmemorable way. The controls are abominably bad, though, requiring you to hold down the mouse button to keep moving and regularly move your mouse around because the pathing is so bad and your bug gets confused. You move at a snail's pace, too. Too bad you don't get to play as one....A much better game in the same vein is Violett. Do yourself a favor and play that instead.			"

												7.2/10 - Beautifully Artful; Short and StellarThis game is usually really cheap so I recommend it. The art style is one of a kind. You are tasked with finding items and making things happen. Most things believe it or not have to do with metamorphism; collect pollen... watch flower grow... collect the end product. There are also puzzles thrown in make you think, but are in no way too difficult to enjoy. Only 5-6 stages on this game so it's pretty short. I'd grab this on sale or in a bundle if possible.Worth $3ish Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

Pros:Beautiful artAnimation really improves this game - you aren't just staring at a static imageQuite a relaxing gameCards/badgeMusicHint feature that is charged by movementHigh quality multi-stage levels (new areas unlocked within the level as you progress through it)Cons:Price quite high for a short game with little replay value (imo), however I bought it in the sales when it was without doubt amazing value for the 2 hours gameplay I got out of it.Ran out of gameplay before I got all the card drops (got 2 hours gameplay and 1 card drop), so having to leave it open to get the remaining 2 dropsDoesn't save progress within levels - if you leave the level before finishing it you lose all progress in that level, levels aren't too long so this isn't gamebreaking, but it can be a painSometimes it's hard to tell where you can go/what to do, but there is a hint feature that is charged by moving, which negates thisCharacter movement is quite slow (although this is thematic) and can be a bit odd - hard to tell where you can go/direct your movementOnly 5 levelsOverall I would strongly recommend this game, however personally I would only buy it when it is on sale or if more content was introduced. (I bought it for £0.20 which was incredibly value.) "

'Morphopolis' is a calm symphonic, seeming surrealistic, game about the (micro/macro) world of insects with puzzle elements.Desc:You start as a caterpillar and you're developing at the end of each level (5 at total) to the next higher stage. Within each level you have to solve several puzzles like sorting colored seed from a flower at the right position. First of all you have to click the objects which have your point of interest and then the game will show you what kind of objects you have to collect. Collect the hidden objects and click the (POI) object again to solve the gathering. You control your figure only with your mouse by pressing the left mouse button to the position where you want to go. Be aware: At some routes are crossroads you may not see at the first time.Pros:+ awesome looking graphics+ great atmosphere+ good calm soundtrack+ slow game experience+ puzzle elements are overwhelmingly brisk (which not seem to be false)+ figure has at each stage of development one ability (suck water drops, wing beat to open seeds, ..)Cons:- non-intuitive controlling (IMHO)- short game duration (could have much more levels)- no other game modes or chapters (where you would for instance develop to other insects like a butterfly instead of a bee)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because it's a very interesting and brisk game, where you will not find one genre that fits 100% to. The world needs more fresh game concepts like this!7/10 "

												This game only took two hours for me to complete, which made me pay roughly €0.09 per hour, which I got back by gaining three cards which can be sold for roughly €0.2~, buit I would have spent €5 for this game, and here’s why.First off, there’s no real option menu, which annoyed me at first since there’s no way to change the volume nor a real interface. Clearly this is more suited for an iPad where you can sit and relax with just your index finger but I’m so happy that I played it on 1920x1080p since the graphics are amazing. The artstyle is colorful and it helps when it comes to how the puzzles are built, forcing you to admire the artstyle while playing. This game is slowing down the pace, forcing you to actually study the environment in search for clues or hidden key all while listening to a wonderful soundtrack that’s soothing and mysterious at the same time.There’s a downside though, the controls can be clunky and the insect you’re playing is moving so slow which makes it mildly infuriating when it comes to running back and forward when it comes to solving puzzles. Yet, this was an amazing gaming experience, and this is coming from someone who usually ignores the puzzles and ragequit while pretending to be intellectually superior since I haven’t let the game prove me wrong.HIGHLY recommend.

In ceartain areas however, the insect had gotten stuck or got confused on where to go, but it was always something fixable. The game is point and click all the way through and there is a lot of walking the insect through the same areas over and over again. Even so, every time I walked through the space again I would always notice something that I hadn't seen before. Furthermore, allow me to again express how beautifull this game is. It has very original graphics as well as a 3D aspect in some levels. There is also a wide variety of different creatures and plants to look at and interact with. In addition there is different music for each level and each puzzle, and I enjoyed every track. The levels usually took 10-30  minutes to complete but I never got bored of the soundtrack.  I would recommend this game to people who like puzzle games and would like to enjoy a couple of hours of relaxing entertainment.			"

												Sometimes frustrating, even with the hint system, but a beautiful and interesting experience nonetheless. Worth picking up for anyone who would enjoy slow crawls through lush illustrations of nature, especially at the current sale price of 24 cents.

												I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of playing Morphopolis. The concept was pretty straight-forward and the puzzles were stimulating enough without being too over-demanding. I actually found it easy to unwind whilst playing this - the colours and sounds created a soothing effect.Morphopolis was compared somewhere to The Room (another game I loved immensely). My experience of the two games differed in that I completed Morphopolis in one sitting, whilst with The Room I reached several points where I became stuck and had to take a break before resuming.When I played Morphopolis there were  five levels and they didn't take too long to get through. It would be nice if more levels were added or a follow-up released. This is a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone.			"

'Morphopolis' is a calm symphonic, seeming surrealistic, game about the (micro/macro) world of insects with puzzle elements.Desc:You start as a caterpillar and you're developing at the end of each level (5 at total) to the next higher stage. Within each level you have to solve several puzzles like sorting colored seed from a flower at the right position. First of all you have to click the objects which have your point of interest and then the game will show you what kind of objects you have to collect. Collect the hidden objects and click the (POI) object again to solve the gathering. You control your figure only with your mouse by pressing the left mouse button to the position where you want to go. Be aware: At some routes are crossroads you may not see at the first time.Pros:+ awesome looking graphics+ great atmosphere+ good calm soundtrack+ slow game experience+ puzzle elements are overwhelmingly brisk (which not seem to be false)+ figure has at each stage of development one ability (suck water drops, wing beat to open seeds, ..)Cons:- non-intuitive controlling (IMHO)- short game duration (could have much more levels)- no other game modes or chapters (where you would for instance develop to other insects like a butterfly instead of a bee)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because it's a very interesting and brisk game, where you will not find one genre that fits 100% to. The world needs more fresh game concepts like this!7/10 "

												Let me start by saying that this is definitely the prettiest Hidden Object game that I have ever played. The graphics are just beautiful to look at and the music is very pleasant. However, I must point out that the interface can be very clunky at times. There are no directions in the game, and no text at all. This can lead to frustration when you don't realize that you could have been double clicking on your character to interact with something, or when you are staring at a puzzle with little or no idea of what you are meant to do... so I don't really recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have the patience to experiment and figure things out on their own. For what I paid, I really did get my money's worth and more.			"

												This game is weird. It's lovely and great fun, but the bug culture being represented is just really weird. You play a bug in each level who gathers parts to rebuild a dead or dying bug and make it your new body (?). I'm not sure if that's what it's about, but that's what I'm going to believe it's about. This game is certainly fun. I don't like the lack of direction in the puzzle mini-games.			"

												It's just a simple point and click come hidden object game and can be completed within a few hours. There really isn't much here past a pretty aesthetic.The visuals to this reminded me of a well made Flash game and mid 2000s Adobe videos like Of Montreal's ""Gronlandic Edit"". Not really worth trying, the only thing that sets it apart is the well done visuals and that's mostly because they're sort of weirdly nostalgic.			"

He showed every one......I did not know what else to do, I felt alone......defeted.....all my emotions got to me......The only thing I thought to do was..............To take more pics.....but better, this time in 1080P and after I took them I sent them and he got jelly, so he sent me some pics, I said ""hal naw bra, that dope af pics"", I lied to him.......I told him they were good.......but in my heart I knew they were bad. every one at school made fun of him and I got his back, he started hangout with the bad kids, at school. they started selling drugs and stealing, I knew it was all my fault. I called the po-po and they caught them selling dope, He went to jail. 20 years later I saw him on facebook, he said we were all good. and he wanted to hang, we meet at a bar and he told me he had steam.....so did I, so I sent him a freind request and we started playing csgo, I bought a csgo key and I got some kind of factory new knife, I always grew up thinking that kinfes were danger! so I was going to sell it, but he told me that they were only worth 3 cents.....and I have ODC and I can only sell stuff for even numbers so I got upset and I took a knife and.......and.....I could not control my self........I just could not.....and got arrest......I got arrested for going into a mattres store, and i asked the store onwer where is the best one, he took me to it, I went to sit in it and it felt rock hard.....and was angry at him, I pulled out my knife and I pulled off the sheets and (You know that lable on the mattres that says ""DO NOT REMOVE) well I removed that. and the mave called 911 and I got sent to downtown. I was in there for about 72 days, worst 71 days of my life, (the first day was the best becuase some cool guy put his hand in my pocket.....but I stared to get odd so I punched him and everyone in jail say I was worthless and stared calling me names. after my jail time was done, I came back online to play csgo and I told him what had happend, he said ""lol loser I scammed you that knife you had was worth $50.00, an even number"" I went to the commuity market and I saw it was worth $53.87 the price had changed since my jail time....then he said, that he had a trading card that was worth $2.00 and the card was NEVER going to change price, so I traded then the card went to $1.69 and i got so mad and said trade back, he said ""Naw bra, a trades a trade and a baby is a baby"" (it was a really good quote not going to lie) then I got so angry and reported him then steam called and they said what did he do, I told them and then they were craking up and called me a loser! so Thats the story about how He scammed me.

												It's got very good artwork, however, that doesn't excuse it for having poor gameplay. A point and click game needs to have responsive clicks. There were many times that I had to click multiple times to get the game to register them. Moving your character around was a pain, occasionally he would start dancing back and forth instead of heading in the direction you had your mouse in. The characters movement speed was painfully slow, which made the levels annoying when they started requiring you to go back and forth between screens collecting things. Finally, it's extremely short, less than 2 hours of content, most of that is waiting for your character to make it to the next screen. If you want to appreciate the artwork, just find some screenshots. There's so few levels that it would only take you a minute to see the whole game.			"

Beautiful hidden-object game with limited gameplay4/10 ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆GameplayMorphopolis needs some decent mechanics despretly. What's there instead of it at the moment is not only basic, but contrasts with stunning aesthetics painfully. Gameplay is constrained to basic movement along fixed routes, clicking here and there, and a few simple puzzles. It is not enough, even for a game not aiming at providing challange, but relax.PresentationThe game is bueatiful. Backgrounds are detailed, full of vivid colors, well-drawn. It is a feast to the eyes; a feast, which cries: I'm ready to please gamers - when the gameplay is about to arrive?Audio is matching and competent, but a mere backgroud for the graphics.Summing upEmpty shell - great graphics with extremely limited gameplay.positive beatutiful relaxingnegative extremely limited gameplay repetitivness short zero replayabilityAesthetic experience - not a game.

There are no checkpoints.The game is simple to play, relatively straightforward (some instructions are missing which slowed down gameplay even further) and has 8 puzzles of different skill levels (4 easy / 1 normal / 3 hard)It has a decent help system with a button you can press for the next objectives location that recharges over time. Sometimes instructions are no clear and will leave you guessing and clicking everything on screen to get to the next location. The game can feel like it takes forever due to the slow game progression and the constant walking between zones. Negative or positive I leave that up to you.Puzzles are not explained very well, so some of them can be hard or difficult not because of the puzzle itself but the lack of information going into the task.Its a nice relaxing, colourful artsy puzzle game for the child at heart. It's only 1$ and has about 2 hours of gameplay.Personal Rating: 3/5 "

												I didn't like this game at all. I am a puzzle loving gamer, but that did not make any sense at all. The puzzles were too hard and you couldn't get hints. Also, it seems that if you try for a long period of time to solve something, at some point the game will let you go through as if you solved the puzzle. It is bad because the developers are admitting that the puzzles are too hard and badly designed, and good because finally I could finish this game. Other than that, I did not like the fact that I had to press all the time on a spot for the character to move to it. The path you should take is not clear, which is fine, but it is not supported by the game. In case you have a place you shouldn't go, your carecter will go that way and get ""stuck"" going back and forth ""polinating"" the area. The ""action"" option is redundant in some stages, so shouldn't appear at all in them, there is simply no point. The character moves too slow and it's annoying when your area of exploration is so limited and frustrating like I mentioned.I did like the art and the music was good. Sounds were nice, but that's about it. There is much, so much more that could have been done in this game to improve it. Too bad it didn't happen.			"

												I recommend this game only for people looking to get an easy 100% achievement game and some trading cards.  I got it for $0.24, and at that price it was worth it to me for the achievements and the cards.This is a fairly easy puzzle game.  There was only one puzzle (the last one) that I considered difficult.  I found the controls for moving my insect (point and click with mouse) to be annoying.  Most of the time you are looking for hidden objects on the screen.  After finding the required objects on each level, there is then a puzzle or two to move on.  There are five levels.  It's very casual, there are no real risks or ways to mess anything up.  You just keep trying until you find the objects or solve the puzzle.  Maybe about 2 hours of total gameplay for 100% achievements, possibly longer if you get stuck on some of the puzzles.			"

Puzzles are kinda good.It does not have good music. It is not unique. You expect something to change gameplay-wise, but it won't.It's short and when I played i through i was relieved that it was over. The game didn't evoke feelings that were positive or melancholic, which I think it tries to do.I'm giving this one a strong MEH.			"

												Got this on sale for 50 cents.I think 50 cents or so would of been a fair price for what I got, but I still can't reccomend it based on the price tag and content alone.If you're really bad at puzzles, the game might take you an hour at most.It took me about 20-30 minutes to beat this game however.Achievements didn't work right away though so I had to beat it 2 more times.The only really hard puzzle for those who have never done them before is the beatle puzzle.It's not as hard as it looks however as you're really just swapping out things in order till it's in the order you need it in.Bottom line is though.1. Not enough content for what it is.2. Puzzles are too easy.3. Music cannot be muted4. 2 dollars for 20 minutes of content with 0 replayability.If you snag a discount card and can snag it for under a dollar, and you like puzzle games with some atmosphere, then I would get it.It's got steam cards as well too so there is that.But even then you'll play it once and never looks back.

												Атмосферная и очень красивая игра, которую можно пройти менее чем за час, но этому препятствует ряд недоработок. В целом игра стоит потраченного времени.Главная её проблема это откровенно слабый геймдизайн - многие вещи слабо очевидны в плане механики, что вынуждает производить слишком много ""научного тыка"". Складывается впечатление, что игру кроме самого разработчка и его кошки никто не тестировал. Второй проблемой является непосредственное управление персонажем. Тут сказывается ""привет"" от мобильных платформ: залипания, вяленькая отзывчивость, недостаточная очевидность доступного маршрута. Третьей проблемой является критическая ошибка r6010 при старте игры (на момент 14.04.2015). РЕШЕНИЕ: ЗАПУСКАЙТЕ project.exe В РЕЖИМЕ СОВМЕСТИМОСТИ Win98/ME. "

No text = no tutorials or instructions, but the puzzles are straightforward enough that figuring out what you're supposed to do feels like part of the gameplay rather than a roadblock.Gorgeous art and music make me forgive Morphopolis's faults -- primarily lack of a save function and poor movement controls.

												Morphopolis is beautiful, occasionally frustrating, and short.What I liked:Gorgeous artworkMore gorgeous artwork (it deserves to be mentioned twice)Fairly original conceptEnjoyable mini puzzlesWhat distracted from my enjoyment:Bug movement issues: I would occasionally get my bug stuck on something and be unable to move it.  Alternatively, sometimes it would interpret an attempt to click on anything, anywhere on the screen as a command to move to the screen above if I were near the top edge.  Also by the end of the game, I found I was impatient with the speed my bug moved.  Apparently it had crossbred with a snail somewhere in there.At least one minipuzzle needs to be a little more dynamic so players can figure out how it works faster.  It took me about ten minutes to figure out that I was supposed to click and drag pebbles, partially because when I tried clicking and dragging there was no feedback or indication that it was working.  (10 minutes to figure out to click and drag.  Maybe 2 minutes to solve.  Meh.)It's short.  Really short.  Five chapters short.  I'm a very slow, stare-at-and-enjoy-the-scenery kind of gamer and I finished it in 3.5 hours.  (Confession time: the final puzzle took me 1.5 hours.  I'm terrible at those.)  There's also very little replay value except to look at the art.Recommended?On sale? Yes. Definitely.Regularly priced?  This depends on how highly you value creativity, puzzles, art, replay value, etc.  Personally, the art helps, but I need a longer game to justify full price.			"

												Well, that game was strange.Graphics: Probably the best thing about this game. It's very pretty to look at, the colors are quite vibrant and interesting. The problem is that everything is so colorful that it's hard to tell what's part of the background and what you can walk/click on, which unfortunately is the main game mechanic.Story: Uhh...basically you're a bug trying to bring all the other bugs back to life or save their buddies. Yeah it's a little weird.Gameplay: REALLY BORING AND SLOW...I guess you could use this game to relax before you go to sleep? It certainly made me tired. You play as a bug that moves ridiculously slowly across branches that are terribly hard to distinguish from the rest of the background. This is basically a point and click game in which you click on various objects that you see labeled on the left side of your screen until you've gotten all of them. Each level has one or two puzzles that are usually knockoffs of pretty popular puzzles (matching games, checkers, and finally a rubix cube type puzzle which I couldn't complete in 30 minutes so I gave up). That final puzzle is absolutely ridiculous, so unfortunately I couldn't beat the game because I got sick of pressing buttons to no avail.Other than that, the music is kinda nice. It's very ambient, and gets annoying after you've heard it for a while, which is usually what happens given how slow the bug moves. I got this game for 20 cents and I'd say it's worth about that. I could see this being a free online flash game. There are only 5 levels, I (almost) beat it in a little over an hour. Get it if you like lots of bugs and looking at pretty pictures and moving really slowly. 3/10			"

												Morphopolis is a visually beautiful game that puts you in the simple life of an insect. You complete puzzles, collect seeds, and perform ""quests"" for other bugs to advance through levels. The colors in this game are great and it you can get a very rewardng feeling from completing some of the challenges. While this game is fun it does have some flaws. The title/level select screen is really simple and really could be better. Also, this game is not something you can play for very long since there really are not many levels and many of them are a cake walk. I personally picked this game up while it was on sale for 24 cents and have no regrets (who would?). I reccomend this game to anyone who would like a break from the shooters for a little bit, anyone who enjoys taking control of insects, or anyone who is in to drugs.			"

However I found this game to be overwhelmingly charming with both its beautiful presentation and simple yet relaxing game play. The art work for the game is beautiful as well as all the ambient sounds and background music. Despite all its beauty and creativity, the game is very short and can be completed in only a couple of hours. This being said it is very much a worthwhile game to play! It gave me a nice break from the chaos of my normal library of games, providing me with a peaceful and enchanting experience. If it's on sale I'd completely recommend checking Morphopolis out. "

												Would I recommend this game? Whenever the price drops for a while again, then yes, especially if you feel charmed by the look of the game. However everything above 2 Euro would seem too much pricy n my opinion... Here's why: Pro: * the artful drawings and likable meditation-inducing piano-sound give off a very nice and enjoyable atmosphere* this game is in reality a Hidden Object Game - search for half-hidden stuff in 2D-sceneries filled to the rim with details and in between play a number of different minigames. Which is great in my opinion because I love HOGs. Well, if you don't, that might not be a Plus for you then...* if you have ever played a bunch of HOGs, you will immediately recognize the minigames and will know what you have to do, as they are all very typical and not too hard to solve* Morphopolis also has elements of an adventure as you have to ""control"" an insect and make it crawl around a bit plus you'll have to click on some cratures or plants to ""hand in"" stuff you've found/collected. But this is very little adventure-like gameplay all in all, much less than most modern HOGs feature actually. Not even as much ""adventure"" as in Botanicula or Samorost, although Morphopolis might make you think of games like that instinctivelyContra:* the game is extremely short. E.x.t.r.e.m.e.l.y. I finished it within 2 hours, which included a coffee-break. To be more precisely: Morphopolis only has 5 ""chapters"", consisting of 17 screens/scenes and 7 minigames in total (if I did not miscalculate). I really wonder why it has to be so short? It couldn't have been so hard to add many more sceneries, more stuff to collect, and perhaps also more of the re-usable types of minigames - especially the beautiful butterfly jigsaw or the ""plant repair""-game. Did the developers just lose interest all of a sudden whilst making the game, or did they have a fight and decided to stop working together instantly?* if Morphopolis was just a point-and-click-game I would have finished it within 1 hour. But the developers had this ""brilliant"" *coughs* idea to make the game ""last longer"" by letting your insectoid avatar crawl only very, very slowly. Painfully slowly :( * the controls add to your discomfort - the way how to move and where to move your insect are horribly rigid. It does not help much that by clicking and holding your left mouse button on the insect it will emit dark greenish ... uh... I really think it looks like dung ... to give a hint about possible paths it can take next within a close radius* it takes a lot of patience to make your insect go where you want it to, but then you make one wrong click and your insect will quickly switch to the next/former screen even if you didn't want that -_-* in chapter two your insect has to eat/suck three egglike things, which you can only find out by sheer luck like by clicking around wildly and hitting one of the eggs per chance. And there's this one minigame in chapter 5 where you have to ""swipe"" with the cursor to let a small heap of seeds ""jump"" over others. It took me quite a while and luck to find out how to move these piles of seed :( No explanations for the controls to be found for minigames anywhere. Is this supposed to be ""part of the fun""? Well, not for me, sorry.* you also cannot skip any minigames, which can be really frustrating for some people. Well, but if you could, then the game would be over in the blink of an eye; so I guess that's why you can't... Pity.* for an Hidden Object Game the stuff you have to find is not ""hidden"" well nor cleverly. Sometimes it is nearly invisible, which will make you click wildly all over your screen after a while - that will do the trick, but will leave you unsatisfied. With this kind of interesting, detailled and colorful background, blending stuff in could have been done 100 times better* the ""story"" about transformation lacks a bit too in my opinion, as in three levels the ""goal"" of your insect is to meet with a much larger insect and seemingly to dig into it's head, which does not make much sense... Conclusion: there are many beautiful hand-drawn artistic games with relaxing music and interesting ideas out there. Morphopolis definitely has the potential to be a real gem of this genre. But it turned out to be a mere sherd. Makes me want to replay Botanicula and sing along with the frogs ;)			"

There also some puzzles on every chapter to obtain some items needed.

												A brief puzzle game for the patient.If you've played and enjoyed Tiny Bang Story, you will most likely enjoy Morphopolis. While controlling an insect, you retrieve a certain number of certain objects for certain taskgivers whether they be other insects or plants. The game in all takes maybe around 30-40 minutes. This 30-40 minutes can easily be filled with relaxation for this breed of game has its calming effects with its soothing music and simple find-the-things gameplay. However, if you are not the most patient person, you may not enjoy this game due to the slow movement speed of the insect that you control to move through different parts of a level. When you know what you are to do, you complete the task in a matter of seconds. It takes just as long, if not longer, to move between the different sections to progress.Overall, if you are patient and want a low-stress game to occupy yourself for under an hour, I would reccomend Tiny Bang Story, but this would come soon after.

												Ummm.  I guess I'll start with the positives for ""Morphopolis.""  It's graphically well done and pretty.  It's short (2.3 hours).  I bought it dirt cheap ($0.19 instead of its list price of $4.99).  And, that's about it.Now for the negative.  For the most part, while playing it, you usually have no idea what you're supposed to be doing or how to do it.  It's one of those artsy-craftsy games that's exploring the boundaries of gaming.  Hand-in-hand with that, there is no win state.  You get to the end and say:  ""Is that it?"" (I actually had to check that I'd got 100% Achievements to figure out that it was over).  And, it's SLOW.  You move an insect from screen to screen, and the game cleverly animates that movement.  At a crawl.  It's and exercise in frustration because you have to crawl from screen to screen over and over again looking for little sprites buried in the scenery.  And, along with all of that, during the game, you don't even know if you can quit and save your state.  After an hour of this frustration, I really wanted to put it aside and recover.  But, I was afraid to quit because I was worried I'd have to repeat everything up to that point again.So, if you want an ""interesting"" game with ""interesting"" art and ""interesting"" mechanics and can find this at practically nothing, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, just pass on by.			"

												In Morphopolis, you play a sort of microscopic parisitic intelligence that seeks progressively larger corpses to inhabit and animate, which is a very cool concept.  You accomplish this by painstakingly crawling your zombie bug of the moment around a few few screens of a fantastical insect realm, all drawn in a psychedelic art style, clicking on a lot of not-particularly-hidden objects and playing a couple of minigames.You may at first find that the game is very, horribly slow, but understand that this is your fault, gamer.  Just because Morphopolis was described as a ""game,"" you thought that it would be something you could ""play,"" while having ""fun"" and worst of all, maybe even ""win"" it.  Those are your preconceptions and they are wrong, wrong, wrong!  Morphopolis is not a game to play, it is a game to experience!  See the fantastical setting?  You didn't see it enough!  An artist went to a lot of work to draw those environments, and you will look at them properly!  Your avatar will keep crossing back into previous screens, where you didn't intend to go, just to ensure that you have properly appreciated the art!  The object-collecting quests will send you creeping back and forth again and again, so you will spend sufficient time staring at the art to demonstrate proper respect.Hear the beautiful, trippy soundtrack?  No!  You weren't paying sufficient attention, what with your gameplayer attitude of rushing through looking for enemies to kill and goals to accomplish!  The developers will helpfully correct you by slowing everything down to the pace of a slug crawling through wet cement, to ensure that you have the time to correctly appreciate the music!There are also no instructions, other than some pictograms, which sometimes makes the nature of the game a bit unclear -- that was to make the experience more immersive, and not in any way a cheap trick for saving money on localization.So don't play Morphopolis, experience it.  It has beautiful art and sound.  If you were expecting to have fun, well, that's your selfish attitude.  Shame on you.			"

												Other reviews of this game have stated that Morphopolis is better as a work of art than a game, but I have to disagree because having bought primarily for the aesthetic of it I found out very quickly that this fails as both a game and as an art project.First, throughout the game there are huge lags in frame rate, which I initially thought was just part of the trippy look of the whole thing, then I thought it was a problem with my computer. But nope, I can run Skyrim with no drop in frame rate on my laptop but this simplistic thing jarrs just by having your insect change direction or if there are too much stuff going on in a particular level.The art work that made me buy the game in the first place quickly became irritating the more I played, the style is not well integrated into the gameplay at all, the title screen made the animation look fluid but when playing the game you often just have your legs animated while they drag your whole immovable body through the levels, the same type of animation cheats they use on most of the non-playable insects and environments, making the whole experience look clumpy and ugly.The controls are equally awkward, you don't use wasd keys because I guess that would not be “arty” enough for the developers, you have to hold the left mouse button in the direction you want to go and there's a 50% chance you might actually get there if you don't have to find something to click on to solve a tiresome puzzle. Most of my playthrough was spent just trying to get my bug in the right direction so that I could crawl on a narrow route through invisible walls just to collect foliage to open the next level. Only to find I had to backtrack to collect a different set of items to actually move on, if they had individual puzzles open every time I had to do this that might have been barely tolerable, many times it's just busy work to pad the game.I spent on average more than 20 minutes doing this alone nearly every level, this is already a short game and most of playing it is navigating nonsensical pre-determined pathways that made me want to kick my laptop into the ocean, if it wasn't through my stubbornness and the promise of achievements and trading cards I would have given up much earlier. The hidden object portion of Morphopolis is really difficult, and not in a challenging or clever way, just in a frustrating eye-squinting way. This is where the art work really works against game, the objects you need often blend too well into the background or are so small you really have to get close to the screen to truly see them, or you have to access them by clicking the bug you control at a specific time, I only found this out through randomly clicking everything in sight and looking at let's plays, the game does not give you any of this information. Most of the levels are a homogeneous mass of art, which would be fine if it was just a very detailed background for a different kind of game, as something you have to slog through in order to complete the game it's a sickening and confusing mess that I tired of very quickly.Which brings me to the puzzles, you don't get much help in this game, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is if finding the hidden objects you need often comes down to clicking everywhere and hoping you get what you need, looking through a walkthrough (where many of the let's players seemed just as lost as I was), or hitting the hint button which straight up tells you where objects are but only when it's charged up and when you're in the right area. Can't find how to access the area you need to be in through the invisible walls? Hint button not fully charged until the next minute? Well tough, you have to wait for the hint button to charge and if no hints are available just wonder about hoping that you can reach where you need to be by clicking on anything, maybe the game will help you find how to complete the level, maybe it won't, maybe you'll figure it out through trial and error, you probably won't, there is no merciful god here.And while we're on the subject, “immersion” does not mean slow and ponderous, being “arty” doesn't mean just plodding through weird surroundings with a weird non-story, you can't layer your game with arty visuals and call it immersive without any further effort on story, character or playability. While I'm sure many defenders of this game found it beautiful and meaningful, I and many others were praying for a skip button or any kind of save feature where we didn't have to go at a snails pace through the same level over and over again because we had the audacity to want to do stuff we enjoyed or look up a guide. Even an option to get out of some of puzzle modes so you can come back to it later or save so you don't have to repeat everything up until that point would have been a logical thing for this game to have, but I guess functionality doesn't win you illustrator awards so that isn't a feature. If the game wasn't so short it would be completely unplayable because of this, as it is it just makes the game annoying.This game even fails to do a jigsaw puzzle properly, the art style while pretty (depending on taste) made what should have been a straightforward jigsaw puzzle into a frustrating rage game. Some of the pieces simply did not look like they were supposed to fit, lumps and bumps that were on pieces slotted perfectly into smoother areas, if it wasn't through a process of elimination I doubt I could have solved the puzzle. If this was unintentional then the developers cannot even develop the simplest puzzle with their art style properly, if it was intentional all it did was baffle me and frustrate me further, either way it made what should have been a beautiful game into an ugly experience. This isn't “challenging”, some of the puzzles fundamentally don't follow reasonable rules, there is no skill involved in these, only guesswork and irritation.I simply did not care what was going on by level 4, there was no incentive to fully complete level 5 for me, Morphopolis gave me no investment in the gameplay, the story (what little it has) and what few characters we see (if you can call them that since we know nothing about these insects and we can't know anything about them because “art”). I wasn't relaxed or charmed, I was bored and angry, even if the game's conclusion was so mind-blowing that it completely made all the flaws I found in it meaningful I simply cannot muster any energy to give a damn about it at this point. As a further insult, the achievements feel hollow because they are awarded for just the level and puzzle completions, no easter eggs or prizes for additional effort seem to be on offer, and the trading card drops for me were only available towards the end of the game and are worth squat on the market.This isn't what a puzzle game should be, this isn't what a hidden object game should be, and it is not what an art game should be. It failed to be good at any of these things, and even though I spent less than 50p on it at the time I still feel ripped off, the developers should feel incredibly lucky to have gotten a positive rating for this.

												My time is a bit inflated because I left the game running when I had to leave the computer, but you get a good hour to an hour and a half of gameplay, depending on how much you use hints and how readily you solve the puzzles. Most of the puzzles are simple, as is the hidden object main part of the game, but the art direction is quite nice. If you can get it when it's on sale for less than a quarter, as I did, it's certainly worth it. I would never recommend paying five bucks for it, though.			"

												Morphopolis is a visually beautiful game that puts you in the simple life of an insect. You complete puzzles, collect seeds, and perform ""quests"" for other bugs to advance through levels. The colors in this game are great and it you can get a very rewardng feeling from completing some of the challenges. While this game is fun it does have some flaws. The title/level select screen is really simple and really could be better. Also, this game is not something you can play for very long since there really are not many levels and many of them are a cake walk. I personally picked this game up while it was on sale for 24 cents and have no regrets (who would?). I reccomend this game to anyone who would like a break from the shooters for a little bit, anyone who enjoys taking control of insects, or anyone who is in to drugs.			"

												Would I recommend this game? Whenever the price drops for a while again, then yes, especially if you feel charmed by the look of the game. However everything above 2 Euro would seem too much pricy n my opinion... Here's why: Pro: * the artful drawings and likable meditation-inducing piano-sound give off a very nice and enjoyable atmosphere* this game is in reality a Hidden Object Game - search for half-hidden stuff in 2D-sceneries filled to the rim with details and in between play a number of different minigames. Which is great in my opinion because I love HOGs. Well, if you don't, that might not be a Plus for you then...* if you have ever played a bunch of HOGs, you will immediately recognize the minigames and will know what you have to do, as they are all very typical and not too hard to solve* Morphopolis also has elements of an adventure as you have to ""control"" an insect and make it crawl around a bit plus you'll have to click on some cratures or plants to ""hand in"" stuff you've found/collected. But this is very little adventure-like gameplay all in all, much less than most modern HOGs feature actually. Not even as much ""adventure"" as in Botanicula or Samorost, although Morphopolis might make you think of games like that instinctivelyContra:* the game is extremely short. E.x.t.r.e.m.e.l.y. I finished it within 2 hours, which included a coffee-break. To be more precisely: Morphopolis only has 5 ""chapters"", consisting of 17 screens/scenes and 7 minigames in total (if I did not miscalculate). I really wonder why it has to be so short? It couldn't have been so hard to add many more sceneries, more stuff to collect, and perhaps also more of the re-usable types of minigames - especially the beautiful butterfly jigsaw or the ""plant repair""-game. Did the developers just lose interest all of a sudden whilst making the game, or did they have a fight and decided to stop working together instantly?* if Morphopolis was just a point-and-click-game I would have finished it within 1 hour. But the developers had this ""brilliant"" *coughs* idea to make the game ""last longer"" by letting your insectoid avatar crawl only very, very slowly. Painfully slowly :( * the controls add to your discomfort - the way how to move and where to move your insect are horribly rigid. It does not help much that by clicking and holding your left mouse button on the insect it will emit dark greenish ... uh... I really think it looks like dung ... to give a hint about possible paths it can take next within a close radius* it takes a lot of patience to make your insect go where you want it to, but then you make one wrong click and your insect will quickly switch to the next/former screen even if you didn't want that -_-* in chapter two your insect has to eat/suck three egglike things, which you can only find out by sheer luck like by clicking around wildly and hitting one of the eggs per chance. And there's this one minigame in chapter 5 where you have to ""swipe"" with the cursor to let a small heap of seeds ""jump"" over others. It took me quite a while and luck to find out how to move these piles of seed :( No explanations for the controls to be found for minigames anywhere. Is this supposed to be ""part of the fun""? Well, not for me, sorry.* you also cannot skip any minigames, which can be really frustrating for some people. Well, but if you could, then the game would be over in the blink of an eye; so I guess that's why you can't... Pity.* for an Hidden Object Game the stuff you have to find is not ""hidden"" well nor cleverly. Sometimes it is nearly invisible, which will make you click wildly all over your screen after a while - that will do the trick, but will leave you unsatisfied. With this kind of interesting, detailled and colorful background, blending stuff in could have been done 100 times better* the ""story"" about transformation lacks a bit too in my opinion, as in three levels the ""goal"" of your insect is to meet with a much larger insect and seemingly to dig into it's head, which does not make much sense... Conclusion: there are many beautiful hand-drawn artistic games with relaxing music and interesting ideas out there. Morphopolis definitely has the potential to be a real gem of this genre. But it turned out to be a mere sherd. Makes me want to replay Botanicula and sing along with the frogs ;)			"

												A brief puzzle game for the patient.If you've played and enjoyed Tiny Bang Story, you will most likely enjoy Morphopolis. While controlling an insect, you retrieve a certain number of certain objects for certain taskgivers whether they be other insects or plants. The game in all takes maybe around 30-40 minutes. This 30-40 minutes can easily be filled with relaxation for this breed of game has its calming effects with its soothing music and simple find-the-things gameplay. However, if you are not the most patient person, you may not enjoy this game due to the slow movement speed of the insect that you control to move through different parts of a level. When you know what you are to do, you complete the task in a matter of seconds. It takes just as long, if not longer, to move between the different sections to progress.Overall, if you are patient and want a low-stress game to occupy yourself for under an hour, I would reccomend Tiny Bang Story, but this would come soon after.

The mechanics are a little whacko at times, which kinda makes maneuvering a little clunky. Overall good game though. I would've paid more for it. Maybe as much as half price and it wouldn't have been a waste. Only took a couple hours to finish it. (I have 6.2 hours on record but I left it running during a long nap once. The piano music was soothing.) Not much replayability in this game, be aware.			"

												This game is amazing.It's not the kind you usually see on Steam. It's usually either hat simulators or rock simulators, so seeing something so artistic was new. The art in this game is beautiful, and so is the music. I would honestly pay for an OST also. The game has a cute, melancholy feel to it, and the art and music are very fitting with each other. It's essentially a hidden object game, but there's also some puzzles and point and click. The gameplay is hard enough to keep it a challenge, but easy enough to make it casual and fun.The one downfall this game has is the shortness of it. I've beaten the game in my playtime, which is 2.5 hours. (Well, almost. I kind of ragequit on that last puzzle, but I'll beat it later lol.) I'm not sure if the price is worth it. The art, music, and gameplay is tremendous, but the shortness is kind of upsetting. Hopefully there's a sequel or update in the future.So overall, yes. I do recommend this game, even for the original price. But, if it is on sale, buy it, because it's a steal. (I got it for 24 cents.) "

												2/10Sorry I know a LOT of work I could never do went into this game, but I just wouldn't recommend it.Things I Liked- The soothing music.- The art.- A couple of the puzzles were a challenge.- The Idea of the next stage being controlling the insect that ate the previous bug you played as.Things I Didn't Like- The controls. I was sat slumped in my chair holding the mouse button watching my bug crawl agonisingly slowly across the screen. - The gamplay. Aside form the puzzles, most of the gameplay is based around looking at the screen to spot things to collect in order to progress.- The hint question mark in the top corner really stood out as looking unfinished against the lovely vibrant level design.- After stage 2 (of 5) I was hoping for a new element to come and wake me up, but it never did.

												Pro's: Art and MusicCons: Everything else- The game is super short.- The gameplay is bad, it's the definition of a bad mobile port.- Your movement is irritatibly slow.- There are no instructions where to go, which is a problem 'cause you have no idea what is path and what is background. So you basically click aimlessly until you figure out what happens next.- Lots of pointless backtracking.- Puzzles start out simple but without any instructions on what to ""solve"" they become painfully annoying. By the end they change for the worst in an absolutely horrible pointless clickfest sliderpuzzle.- No ending, finished the last puzzle, fade to black, main screen.Got it for €0,66. The art is most definitely worth that, the game around it is not.			"

												The gameplay is based solely on puzzle solving and collecting hidden objects. Some of the puzzles are not as obvious and many of the objects are not as noticeable as a player might think. What I liked the most is the mood of the game (thanks to the soundtrack, animation and art). And I'm fond of insects as well.If you like insects, like I do, and want to experience a memorable adventure in the world of insects, buy it and enjoy.The only drawback is that the game is too short.

												This games looks really beautiful.   After playing it for a little bit, I did get bored, the game does not give you really any direction on what you are doing or how to interact with the puzzles.  I would say google is going to be your best friend in this game.  To me this is a bad concept, I don't want me hand holding, but googling to figure how to play a game is silly.  The music is very soothing but turn it down for best results, graphics are very beautiful, and the puzzles well, hit and miss.  I may not have played the game very long, but this is going on the do not play list in my library for sure. I would give this game a do not recommend because of the vague nature of how to play and puzzle mechanics are just straight up unexplainable.  Only buy this when Steam has it on sale for less than .50 cents its not worth the full price.			"

												?/? - morphine comes to mindThe late film critic Roger Ebert once refused to rate ""The Human Centipede"". He kind of felt that as a movie it was unbearable but that maybe the author/director was only using the medium film to make a statement, that maybe it was art  - and art is nothing that a film critic could judge.I am kind of in the same place now. As a game it is a complete fail in my opinion - but maybe it's some weird kind of art, or a Zen statement, or maybe it's meant as an animated music video, or maybe it's the ""Lucy in the Sky"" for PC games - honestly I have no clue.All I know, is that I would NOT recommend it to the 'regular' gamer that makes up 99% of the Steam user base.

												Bought the game for the art style, and on that it delivers. In all other aspects though, it really doesn't.You control a bug that goes from larvae to some form of avian insect reminiscent of a bumblebee. To do this you crawl (very slowly) from screen to screen through out five short chapters, collecting objects to manipulate the world in different ways. This part is pretty much a hidden objects-game. Sometimes when you have collected all the parts for one of the objectives you are rewarded with a small puzzle. These puzzles aren't anything special. The difficulty of the puzzles are for the most part trivial, but I got stuck twice because of a couple of very misleading or unintuitive elements. And that is all there is to it.I paid 0,19€ for it, and for that price I think it's worth a play through just for the art. For the regular asking price though, I would not recommend it, for that price I'd expect more game for my money.			"

												Very nice artwork, neat sense of depth.  Music is fitting and sets the mood.  It's half hidden object half puzzle game with puzzles that are not very fun or unique.  I did enjoy the last puzzle and would of liked more of that.  About an hour and a half of playtime.  Artwork doesn't make a game even though it is really nice, I even liked just looking at the menu screen.  Neat to look at; not very fun.			"

												A very simple & short puzzle/hide & seek game.Took a little over 2hours to complete start to finish. Would be much quicker if I wasn't colourblind so the last level was a hit & miss for me. However, for the sale price of 15p and easy to obtain 100% achievements it's fun while it last's.Nice vibrant colours & has a beautiful soundtrack to it to make it an even more relaxing game. ^^			"

												I am utterly shocked that this game has received such high reviews.   This is a point and click with a different sort of artsy backdrop of bugs and plants.  The artistry is nice, but it really stops there.  I really tried to like this game and even completed it, hoping for some redeeming value.  getting the bug to move from screen to screen was tedious, having to go back to old screens to collect items you weren't allowed to collect originally (even knowing it would be necessary later), and having to figure out what you were to do on each screen became monotonous. And the bug was SLOW.  getting the puzzles to start was also slow (the lightening bugs, for example).  There was a good 15 second delay.  Does not seem like much in the scheme of things, but just sit there waiting to understand what the game is doing, and it seems like an eternity.By the end of the game, when I wasn't sure what was next, my thought was, ""it had better not make me go through all of the screens on this level to collect the water drops.  If it does, its over!""  It did not, thankfully, but that did not make the game any more fun.  There is no guide, except a little question mark in the upper right corner to ""help"" you when you are stuck.  But, it does not always help you.  It ONLY helps when looking for a collectable item and it is on the page you are on, otherwise it gongs.  If there is another step (a branch, for instance) it does not help you find it.  Time was wasted on trying to figure out what the many puzzles wanted.  Once I understood them, it was fine, but it was not intuitive.My final though was, ""did I really spend money on this game?""  I bought it on sale, but, that does not make me any happier.  I buy most of my games based on the very positive ratings they receive.  I would not pay money for this game unless I were a point and click collector.  There are plenty of other point and clicks (even free) that are much more enjoyable.  The two hours I lost on the game were not enjoyable ones.			"

												I should have known a game that looks like an ugly handbag couldn't play well. The controlls are awful, with your insect turning around and going back if you overshoot slightly, or, as it was for me, every single time I tried to move somewhere, at least twice. It's very hard to know where you can go, what to do next, what you're supposed to be hunting, if the irational rage you suddenly feel towards women and insects says more about the game or you... It's a lot of uncertainty to handle, too much for the hints system to address. I got stuck in the second level when the full gamut of places I knew how to access contained no hints, and had to rage-quit. the absence of mid-level saves has a silver lining, in at least excusing my refusal to return to the game.Basically it was awful and I'm proud of myself to managing to review it without swearing. I did get it for 19p in the sale, so you would think I would be able to contain my anger.			"

												Morphopolis combines classic puzzles with searching for hidden object, I'm not the massive fan of the latter but I haven't played any in a while so I enjoyed it. Visuals were really nice, totally the game's best point. Controlling the bug is a bit flawed and sometimes it wasn't clear how to interact with objects and I have to admit it could get annoying but still my overall impression is good. It doesn't take much time to crack the game but considering the price it was more than enough.			"

												It's going to make you want to re-play Botanicula. It's artstyle is definitly it's strongest point, It's got sort of a yellow submarine vibe. Soundtrack fits and that's pretty much it. It's your standard point and click kleptomaniac adventure, you play as an insect who's trying to do an impression of russian nesting dolls by routinely taking over the brains of vegative insects and piloting them into larger insects. There are a couple of clever minigames inbetween the cleptomainiac collecting but there just aren't enough. Sort of my problem with the whole game really, it feels way too short and yet still feels incredibly  padded in every area.Point and click adventure games are one of the oldest forms of game, yet developers still manage to ♥♥♥♥ them up. The walk speed is horrible and the puzzles are never based off logic, although I do like how the game just tells you what objects you need to progress, (rather than doing the normal adventure game rigamarole of throwing every item at a door in the hope it somehow creates progress) it does get pretty boring.It's a shame really, I like the concept, and the art style and music are good and it's got a lot of heart in it; it just stumbles, tripps and ♥♥♥♥'s itself in the gameplay and story division.

												In Morphopolis, you never really know what exactly you're looking for or where to find it. But it's a pretty (and short) little puzzle game that will make you look around and explore the jungly bug-land that it's set in. You should be armed with patience, a clever mind, a pair of glasses and a younger sibling/kid to help you out, just in case. (If you have none of those, a cat, an owl or a toad would work, too, I guess.)I'd say it's worth the 99 cents you'd pay for it (or definitely worth the 33 cents, if you got it on sale). But that's just my opinion.			"

												Overall, do I recommend this game? Yes, I would just say wait till its on special though. I did enjoy my time with it. It was fairly easy, a god little time killer without being too full on. Just click and point to make your bug move, and collect the objects. Every now and then you'll have to do a puzzel (jump the seeds, make a puzzle, etc)The graphics are cute and the music is nice. However, the music gets really reptitive fast. I also did not finish - I gave up on level 5 with the bug body spinning thing. But, the controls were ""buggy"" (lol) and my little bug often got stuck (worst bits were level 4 with the branch in front of the bug guarding the hole, and level 5 going either up the wall or down into the cave).

												A collection game. Reminds me of what I used to play as a kid in the 90s where you just get given things to look for and they are hidden in places, sometimes in plain sight, and sometimes there is a puzzle you have to figure out to get one of the items. Enjoyable, though absolutely no replay value and not very challenging; you'll find yourself alt-tabbing and leaving it alone just to rack up enough play time to get the cards after you've completed it.At £3.99 it's a rip off and the creators should be ashamed of themselves, but for something picked up on the summer sales for 10p it is good.

If you play around, you'll likely figure out what's going on a fter a couple minutes.  Or, ya know, GTS.It will probably give most people around 2 hours of gameplay.All in all a relaxing little fun game, with wonderfully done art.			"

												The game looks beautiful and gameplay simple but very relaxing.But two things grind my gears: 1. CONTROL IS AWFUL. It's worst control scheme on desktop game ever. It expect touch screen input, but I use mouse. It very slow movement and a lot of wrong input.2. Last puzzle. Whole game was pretty easy and slow-paced. But not last puzzle. No-no. My brain melted trying to solve it. There a lot guides for this puzzle, but poor visual design make it worse - there is a lot of colors that man can recognize, but game develop choose 5 color, two pairs of which are Green and Light Green, and Yellow and Greenish Yellow. No black, no white, no whatsovere.I liked this game, but in same time it burn a lot of my nerves.			"

												I can't complain since I bought this for 19 cents.  That's basically me selling two steam trading cards.The feeling the game gives off... I don't how many of you remember ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar,"" but it invokes that same kind of nostalgic blast of color, something that mesmerizes you.  It is more than ten times as bright and vivid as that book, but as adults that's what it takes to overload your senses.  At the same time there is an ever-present sensation of faded-ness.  Like the bright colors are constantly waning and all your efforts is only leading you to the end of both the game and your buggy life.The game play is nothing special.  It is just a point and click with a few puzzles.Note:  Screw the beetle lock!  That took me half an hour.  That's 25% of the time spent on this game wasted on a bland rock with five bugs on it!			"

It's a beautiful piece of art, there are some things to consider before buying it for the full price:Pros:* Absolutely beautiful to see* Some nice and not too hard find-the-objects action* Original and clever little puzzlesCons:* Didn't have any sound for me, for some reason* Some puzzles are way too hard, I found myself clicking randomly in two of them* It can ve reaaaaally slow to go from A to B* Even with all the puzzles and walking around it is very short, took me 1.6 hours to complete (Please don't refund it, guys)* Achievements are meaningless, you get them just by progressing and there's 100% possibility in having all of them just by finishing the game* No replay valueAll in all, I liked it.

												Morphopolis is a very short game, but I really enjoyed it. For the first few moments, I was frustrated, but then you have that ""aha"" satisfaction for figuring out the mechanisms without being told. Yes, there is a lot of moving back and forth. But the soundtrack is lovely, the visuals are delightful, and it was a very relaxing experience. I do wish there were more levels, though. I finished the game too quickly to even get one card drop (which isn't a big deal for me but gives a sense of how short it is). Definitely consider it if you like puzzle games and it's on sale.			"

												I felt compelled to check out this game when it was on sale for $.19, because how could such a beautiful looking puzzler be only $.19? I'm so glad I did. This is a very small, quirky game, but it's a beautiful little gem well worth your time.The music and hand-drawn insect and nature art create a very peaceful, otherworldly atmosphere to explore. There are no words or text instructions, but the game has a hint button which will highlight your next step if you can't figure out what to do next. Gameplay is basically hidden item-gathering exploration, interspersed with a puzzle in each chapter. The game progresses in a way that feels natural to understand. The puzzles can be tricky, but not impossible, and everything about the game is satisfying when you figure things out on your own. That said, if you get totally stuck on a puzzle and need a nudge in the right direction, check out the excellent Steam guides people have written.Some caveats: There are five chapters, and if you close the game in the middle of a chapter, you'll have to start from the beginning of that chapter again. I can't find this as a flaw since the chapters take so little time to complete (you can finish the game with all achievements in 2-3 hours), but it's something to know before you play.You also can't close the game during a puzzle, but again, most of them don't take very long to solve. One reviewer complained that puzzles have no reset button if you mess them up, but none of them can be messed up except the chapter 4 puzzle, which does have a reset button (the yellow spot on the right of the puzzle).This is a very small, lovely little world to spend a couple of hours in, and I recommend it.

												Beautiful graphics.  Takes about 3 hours to guide your 'insect' through 5 stages.  You have to collect things blended into the background and solve several puzzles.  The game saves after each stage but there is no manual save.  In most cases I dislike that but in this case it would have been excessive.  You just have to relax and imagine you're exploring a new world and take it as it comes.  If you're completely stuck, there is help to find the hidden items but the puzzles just have to be solved.

												For £0.15 this game was worth it, but by god the last puzzle with the bugs you have to slide around made me want to stick pins in my own eyes. Whether it sounds salty or not - it ruined the game for me.You have this beautiful landscape to look at, and sure, the bug moves along at the slowest pace imaginable - I can deal with that, I just look at the pretties and whatever, but the last puzzle? Good god, seriously, if you removed the last puzzle or changed it or something, I'd pay more, I really would.The other puzzles throughout the game are great, they get a bit difficult at times and I know from the game forums that people who are colour blind struggle with some parts, so to have such a road block right at the end of an otherwise peaceful, chilled game just ♥♥♥♥ all over it for me personally.The music is lovely, the game looks wonderful. Your little bug dude moves at a snail's pace and while the game has hidden object elements it's relatively straightforward. Get ready to back track quite a lot however as these objects are strewn across several screens. I personally wouldn't have minded less game time in return for less back tracking, it feels like you're being forced to just play for longer sometimes and that's never enjoyable in a game that is already pretty short. I would say the achievements are easy to get but I still just can't get past the last puzzle so I can't 100% :(Also, the game doesn't feature a proper save system, so if you get mid way through a scene, DON'T quit, because you'll be forced to start the entire level again from the beginning (again, wouldn't be as much of a ball ache if the bug didn't move so slow). At present I can't bring myself to stare at that last puzzle for the 15 minutes I've already sank into the activity, but I recommend the game based on its otherwise pleasant presentation.(....but really I want to be a petty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and click 'no' purely because of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bug puzzle...can you taste the salt?)

The story is not in the least inspiring and the movement speed of your character pisses me off.no-What puzzle?-This game has no challenge-It takes 3 hours to finish because the character really moves that slow!yes-IT HAS CARDS!-The ahivments are to compleate the game(3 hours) and theres another perfect game for your profile.

												Short and sweet hidden object game where you get to be a set of cool insects. Art style is fantastic, and some of the puzzles are very nicely done, although there was one where it took me forever to figure out how to interact with it! Well worth the price IMO			"

												Thought it was gonna be a cute hidden object/ive game, was plesantly surprised by the bizzare aspects of it. The objectives and puzzles are pretty straight forward, only two parts weren't as clear as they should be instruction-wise. and by that I mean the pollen exchange nodes (there aren't any cues to jump over and that you can jump around the edges too) and the stick bug bridge (his cammoflage was too good lol).Would definitely play a longer version :DAlso, amazing soundtrack!!

												Although some may commend it for its beautiful art style; the gameplay is infuriating, unrewarding, and far too slow for me to really appreciate all Morphopolis has to offer. There also isn't a menu where I can tinker with the sounds, which means I have to listen to that annoying bug chirp in the background for the entirety of the game.The controls are maddening. You click and drag your cursor in the direction that you want the bug to move, but unfortunately the controls don't always work. You'll find yourself dragging, only to watch your bug go back and forth. In certain points, you'll have to wait for an animation to finish until you can move your bug again - which can be upsetting if the controls are screwing up constantly. There is also tons of backtracking, which makes every level feel tedious. Since every level that you play seems to end with you collecting a serious of orange balls, I know that I am going to have to do that at the end, but I can't collect them all before I receive the quest. Subsequently, I'm forced to backtrack through every single level to collect all of the orange balls in order to go to the next level that will ask me to do the same thing.Backtracking wouldn't be that much of an issue if your character didn't trek along at the speed of molasses. The two hours that you'll spend completing this game could be cut down to about an hour and half if the bug would move just a tad bit quicker. Unfortunately, that never happens and you're forced to watch your bug move uncomfortably slow through every area - which can be upsetting if you're someone that enjoys gameplay that actually moves at an appropriate pace.Also, the last puzzle is a treat. By that, I mean, you'll be shouting at your computer screen and wondering why the hell anyone would develop a puzzle as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the one you're playing. In the end, Morphopolis is slow, boring, and unrewarding - the gameplay is too little movement, too much grinding and that's just no fun. I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Art is gorgeous and the concept is great. Though it is kind of disturbing that your insect burrows into another dead/almost dead insect and starts controlling them. Made me think of some Las Plagas shiz.The puzzles can be a bit frustrating and the insect you control moves really really slowly, but I'd still recommend it for the beautiful music + art. Buy it when it's on sale tho.			"

												So Morphopolis is like if Myst were a hidden object game about bugs. Also, short. While it's refreshing being able to discover the puzzles vs. having them explained to death before even getting to them, I do find the controls a bit strange, as though this was designed for mobile (maybe it is, I didn't check); after the second stage, everything starts to look like fetch quest items (they are); and I found the ""repair the plant"" puzzle slightly annoying because it's unclear how to solve even when you know what to do... plus, it emphasizes the weirdness of your quest to basically resurrect dead things.Still, it's very pretty (if you like bugs), and if you got it super cheap like I did, it's worth a playthrough.

												An interesting Hidden Object style game, though not one that's easy to recommend.The longer you play for, the more the small things irritate you. Like having to wait while your bug crawls ever-so-slowly across the screen to move to a new area, it's a dreadful new way of padding-out a game's length. If moving between screens was simply a matter of clicking arrows (like in most other HOG's) then you'd finish it 66% faster than it actually takes. If you're short of patience i imagine it will drive you up the wall. Also there is a lack of explanation for some of the puzzles leaving you clicking randomly all over the place until something changes and you can see what you're supposed to be doing.  It's not worth full-price but if you're a die-hard Hidden Object fan then pick it up in a sale.   "

												Spent a couple months sitting in my library before I got around to playing it, so I had to go back and look up how much I spent on it.  I reckon it was worth the 19 cents I paid for it on sale, but I was a bit concerned I had paid more for it considering how short it turned out to be.  90 minutes of playtime.  Some problems with the controls; feels like a bad port from touch screen.  However, all in all enjoyable for the aforementioned price.

												I have very mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, it's very pretty, and the puzzles and scavenger hunts are mostly fun and clever, which is usually all I ask for in a game like this. The setting is gorgeously done and sucks you in right away. When I first started playing, I was thrilled with this game; my only complaint for the first three levels would have been that the puzzles were too easy, and that's highly forgivable in a game meant to attract players of all ranges in age and skill. On the other, the inability to either back out of a puzzle once it was initiated (short of forcing the game to minimize/quit) or save midlevel meant every new puzzle involved a level of commitment and occasional stress I really wasn't looking for in a casual point-and-click. Since the only two puzzles I had real trouble with were at the end of their levels, I had to redo those entire levels just to get at the puzzles again, which was kind of aggravating since this is the kind of game that's only fun when you don't already know the answers.Despite the extreme minimalism in terms of storytelling, I was also intrigued by the narrative, and disappointed when there was no real closure to the story. The last level ended about like any other. Did my weird glowy bug spirit make it to where they were going? What was the ultimate point of this strange and arduous journey? I'm not saying I want concrete answers, but some kind of closure would have been nice. It's similar to the problem I had with Lilly Looking Through, which played like the demo to a game I'd love to play in full.I wish Steam reviews didn't require you to say whether you recommend or don't recommend a game, because there's enough good in here that I'd like to recommend it but enough bad that I'd have heavy caveats. I picked Morphopolis up for ten cents during a Steam sale. For ten cents, if you like puzzles and scavenger hunts, it's pretty good. For the current price, I'm going to not recommend it. Maybe keep an eye on the folks who made Morphopolis to see what they do next, instead of getting too excited about Morphopolis itself.			"

												I want to like this game but I cant get past the incredible annoyance the point/click (hold left mouse button forever) mechanic caused me. Competly took me out of what would've been an extremely plesent experience. Not to mention that this annoyance is blown out of proportion by the makers not providing any sort of instruction any puzzle save the first inital scene. What was wonder and happiness turned to bitter yelling due to the same mouse button being used to move as to click on mission items causing you to move everytime you went to click on anything, its hard to explain with words, but once you get to the second level, you will understand. The speed at which the characters walk it is absurdly slow at points, adds to the rage of accidently exiting to a different screen.Decent in-game ambient music, a bit too serene for my liking, but it has its charm, quite possibly worth the purchase for the music and art itself. Entertaining game just stressful for people who like to the point games (myself included). NOT INTEDED FOR PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND QUICK TEMPERS, YOU COULD POSSIBLY DIE!!!!

												Pros:Just from the screenshots it is obvious the game is stunning. It has an art style that sucks you in. The game mixes point and click, hidden object, and easy puzzle solving. There are 5 levels that you progress through and in each one you expereince the world as a different bug. It is a really orginal and fun idea. Cons:The controls take a little getting used to. I was so frustrated in level one that I almost quit. That was the only level I had issues moving the bug. It gets easier. The price. I am not sure that I would have loved the game so much if I had payed full price. I got the game during the Summer Sale and paid less than a dollar for it. Totally worth it.It is short. The puzzles are not that difficult and I finised the entire game in an hour and half.Overall, if you can get the game while it is on sale, go for it! It is not long but it is fun and beautiful to look at. I will probably play this game again when I just need a stress reliever.			"

												I adore this game. It's so pretty! Just a very simple point and click, find the hidden objects type game. Click around the environment to be given objects to find, then once you've found the objects return them and be given a puzzle. If you're stuck, spam the hint button.I will say that your avatar moves kind of slowly which can get annoying, and that the ending is a bit anticlimatic. I don't care though because it is so beautiful. The objects and the puzzles are really just an excuse to enjoy the scenery. It's kind of psychedelic, kind of surreal...just really gorgeous.

It was fairly easy, a god little time killer without being too full on. Just click and point to make your bug move, and collect the objects. Every now and then you'll have to do a puzzel (jump the seeds, make a puzzle, etc)The graphics are cute and the music is nice. However, the music gets really reptitive fast. I also did not finish - I gave up on level 5 with the bug body spinning thing.

												This is a cute game where you control various bugs which go around solving puzzles and collecting hidden objects. It looks vaguely like one of those adult colouring in books and has a calming (if somewhat repetitive) Zen-ish soundtrack to go along with it.The main problem is that the puzzles vary wildly in their difficulty. Some are really easy, like the Memory puzzle with beetles with different numbers of spots on their back or the glowworm pattern repeating puzzle. Others are harder and really difficult to do without a walkthrough, like the petal Draughts and the last Beetle Lock (never doing that again). There are also a few weird bugs (!!) here and there, like when my aphid (part 3 I think?) refused to dissolve the little red balls surrounding the squiggles I had to collect (I prefer to call them squiggles to imagining they're gross maggots or whatever). Like, he would spray his green goop and make his little sucking motion, but he just wouldn't suck up the red balls. Resetting the game entirely and redoing everything he did it fine, but that was really weird and I suspect would have put off someone who does not like wasting their time as much as I do.It would also be really nice to include colourblind options in this game. A lot of the puzzles really need it (like the beetle lock puzzle) and, besides, it's the year of our luigi 2015 - you should be including colourblind options just by default.I would tentatively recommend this game, because it's cheap and very pretty. I wouldn't recommend paying more than a dollar or two for it, though.			"

												Decent game. A pretty and relaxing object finder and puzzle game. The bug moves slow, but that fits the tone of the game. Most of the game is pretty intuitive, which is good ‘cuz there’s no instructions. Kinda short, only takes about 1-2 hours to complete. Also little replay value, but you can get it pretty cheap, so not too unreasonable. Pretty sure you get all the achievements just by playing though the game once, so a good game for people who care about that sort of thing. Only real problem I had is once you open one of the puzzles afaik you have to either solve it or ctrl-alt-delete out of the game. Seems like poor game design. Spoilers! One content warning: The bug you are / are guiding eats its way into a few dead bugs. It’s not graphic in any way, and it is perfectly natural for a bug, but it might disturb someone who is very easily grossed out, or someone who really doesn’t like bugs.			"

Summary Pretty nice hidden object game with a lovely aesthetic and some decent mini-game puzzles, but with janky controls and a nonexistent story. Worth it at a low price for fans of the genre. Long story  Morphopolis is a pretty hidden object game. If you do not like hidden object games, do not buy. You play as various iterations of insects that are moving through the world at a very slow pace for… some reason. As far as I can tell there is no story to the game, just a series of hidden object games and mini-puzzles set in a relatively pretty world. For me that was fine.My biggest problem with the game was the awful movement controls. You hold down the mouse courser to move instead of just clicking; this results in some awkward dancing and can lead you to incorrectly assume that you cannot move further along a path. The movement is also way too slow and there is no option to double click to change scenes quickly, which artificially prolongs the game by forcing you to crawl back and forth between scenes. The game also does a relatively poor job of explaining the mini-game puzzle rules as well as some important mechanics which can lead to some frustration. For example you can click on your own character which will is essential to reveal items in some chapters, but as far as I know that is never mentioned in the tutorial. Still, if you can get it cheap (I got it as part of the art appreciation pack for 0.44 Euro) and you like hidden object games, why not? It’s not a great game, but it was worth the two hours I spent on it.			"

												Stylized, nature-based visuals are accompanied by soothing music. This another indy puzzle game, this time involving point and click discovery that results in short collection missions. The collection of certain items triggers mini games which are visual, memory and manipulation puzzles with insect- and plant-based themes. Mini games are varied and some are MUCH harder than others. There's a lot of matching and picture manipulation. Even though I am recommending this game - the art style is interesting, the music is pleasant, and the minimal story line is noce - there are a few drawbacks.1) Because this is a wordless game, sometimes your objectives are really hard to figure out. The help recharges after a certain amount of time to give you hints, but if you're not currently in the part of the map where the help hint will show, it just gives you an ""error"" sound.2) Because the art is so stylized and items in the enviroment can look different from different angles, sometimes it's unclear whether an item is one of the kind you should be collecting. Insect parts, in particular are very hard to distinguish from the background foliage. This could very well be intentional, but at times I found it very frustrating, and I'm a fan of jigsaw puzzles and ""what's different about these two pictures"" type puzzles.3) The ending is extremely abrupt and I found this kind of disappointing. You following along with the adventures of this little creature through 5 levels and then BAM. It's just done.Having said that, it's a good way to poke at puzzles for several hours and was challenging enough to keep my interest for a one-sitting game. Little in the way of replay, but I got it on sale, so I feel I got my money's worth.			"

BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GAMEIn this game you play an insect on the way through it's stages of metamorphosis. You start small and your task is to find and collect things in a colourful level (sounds more easier than it is!) to get access to other parts of the level.There are some puzzles after all things are collected and that's the highlight of the game, because the puzzles are fun.I played it for 100 minutes and completed 100%.

												Lacks a mid-level save feature, and some levels are very lengthy. Easy to accidentally 'quit' through the use of non-sense arbitrary menu icons instead of text. Does not warn you that you will lose what may amount to 45-60 minutes of gameplay. Controls are god-awful, your insect moves painfully slowly, and will often refuse to follow the commnds of yoour cursor, decided just to whichever way it wants. The game has you crawling (craaaawling) around collecting hidden objects, only to find out you then, after 'beating' the boss, must go back to collect all these amber blobs around the map. Since it takes forever to navigate through the levels of a screen it's a horrible experience. Walking slowly, truging up and down the plants. Most of this game feels like filler. One of the puzzles is literally impossible to accomplish without a video (Reconstruct a Plant in Level 4). Some of the puzzles are interesting well designed, others feel like unguided nonsense. Overall this is a miss.Great visual design, bad game design.			"

												This game is actually really interesting. It’s a beautiful piece of art with high details and bright colors. No, I am not talking about a painting; I’m talking about the game although the game is like a painting in a way. It has a very calming feel that helps you relax as you try to work out the puzzles and find the items in which you’re looking for. It’s a very short game, only about an hour or two depending on how good you are at puzzles and hidden object games. Behind the puzzles and artwork, we have an interesting sort of story that is abstract enough for you to take what you want from it. It is one of those games that might have a deeper meaning if you really want to look for it.They don’t really explain a story line for the game much, you are thrust straight into the game as a little larva or caterpillar wiggling around. It keeps you in that insect world as you go from a small larva to a grasshopper to a bee and so on. There aren’t any times that you actually fly or jump which is kind of strange but you walk around gathering items and the end of the stage is crawling into what looks like a carcass of the bug you will be next. I know the game is called morphopolis and is supposed to be about metamorphosis but this feels more like you taking over the dead bug instead. The game play is… at times its pretty good when you get into the puzzles but the movement of the character walking around is a little hard to deal with. Times when I am clicking to find the objects, the little character that I was playing would move and go into a different scene when I am not ready for it. That’s the problem with clicking the screen being both for finding items and moving your character. There are times when my character also had trouble finding the pathways I wanted him to go on.  I think it would have been a bit easier if they had the arrow keys to move the character as I could hit the down button or up to go on those paths. The character moves very slowly which can make that part of the game boring when you have to go back and forward to collect items. There is a lot of back tracking in this and it would have been nice to be able to have the character speed up. There is one other problem that I do have with the puzzles. The puzzles don’t tell you how to do them, you sort of just have to try different things to figure it out. There was one puzzle I got stuck on because nothing I did was actually working that I had to look up what the puzzle was supposed to be so I could play it.The artwork is so amazing. It’s very high detail and is almost like a surreal painting with how playful the colors and designs are. The problem with this though is that there are times you can’t find the path you need to go on most of the time. The paths just blend in with the background or are really hard to figure out. They luckily have it so that when you click your character, a couple green sparkles will resonate from him and travel a little way along the path though sometimes its hard to see depending on how high detailed the area is around them. On the other hand, the high detail does make finding the objects your looking for all the more rewarding as it is hard to see them. The music is so calming and a little mysterious. There is one track through the whole thing and yet I never got bored of it. It’s a piano solo that almost put me to sleep a couple of times during the long walk parts. That is all I can really say on it as its just calming.Overall, it was a nice little game to play. Is it worth the money that it is on steam right now? Maybe not. I got the game on a steam sale and It was worth the amount I paid for but I’m not sure if it’s the full $4.99 worth. My recommendation is to get it on sale because it is a good game, and it is beautiful. If you get it for the normal price, then you’re mostly paying for the artwork.			"

												Morphopolis is a beautiful, but ultimately unpolished little gem of a game. I got it on sale for about $1. For that price, it is definitely worth it. For anything more, I might not have considered it had I known what I know about it now.First impressions were good; the hand-drawn art is gorgeous and scrolls seamlessly, and the music is okay enough, albeit a little repetitive.My frustration began in the tutorial chapter. Morphopolis, true to its nature as a game about insects, has no written language components anywhere. Everything is indicated through a series of visual pop-ups and hand icons, which unfortunately extends to the interface of the game. Just trying to move my insect at the beginning devolved into the hand icon relentlessly mocking me as I tried various clicking, dragging, and clicking-and-dragging motions until I randomly stumbled upon something that worked. It turns out that in order to move the insect, you have to click and hold down on the spot where you want it to move, making the tutorial's hand motion completely misleading.Despite this, once I got used to the demands of having to figure out not only the solution to each puzzle, but what I was trying to accomplish in the first place, I started to get into the rhythm of clicking on bugs, gathering objects, and opening up new pathways to other bugs so I could backtrack and get more objects. The hint feature was helpful; however, one thing that was not helpful was having no hint feature nor exit button on the mini-puzzle segments. The languid pace of the game encouraged me to take my time, however on more than one occasion I had to tab out of the game to look up a guide because literally none of the mouse movements I tried were showing any sign of progress.Each level ends with having to collect the body parts and eggs of a giant insect, after which the grub burrows into its flesh(?), metamorphoses, and gains a new appearance and powers (which are activated by clicking the left mouse button once -- another thing I had to figure out through laborious trial and error). Once I figured out that mechanic, it was fun to use environmental cues to determine what the likely outcomes of using the bug's power would be. The bug got stuck on the environment sometimes, including on the exit of the final level, though the jerky flipping motion at least indicated to me that something unintended was going on.For all the frustration the game gave me, I did finish it, in under two hours. Overall I give it a 6/10, which is a recommendation, but just barely. I enjoyed the core gameplay and setting, immersing myself in the world and the journey of the aphid, but there are way too many omissions of features that would have reduced the amount of times I was simply jarred out of the game by frustration at its minimal interface and sometimes buggy mechanics.

												So, I bought this game on sale for it's visual presentation, and in that area I was not dissapointed; the game is beautiful and does a fantastic job of making you feel like you are in the pages of a storybook. The game itself has some hiccups to work through, though.First of all, the game was designed for a touch screen, and it shows. The all mouse interface is functional, but not ideal. While finding things through the world is fine, the use of the mouse for movement is clunky and can definitely start to grate after a while, especially as you slowly move up and down and back and forth across the levels. Some of the puzzles likewise feel a bit clunky which can push a challenging puzzle over the brink into frustrating. The puzzles themselves are fine, nothing too wild and probably variations of things you've seen before. That's not bad, just know that it's nothing groundbreaking.The game itself is made up of I spy hunts for various items, puzzles, and the occasional interaction with the environment. Again, nothing earth shattering, but functional enough to keep things interesting. Most of the gameplay is made up of hunting for the items on the screen with puzzles being the reward for finding them. Again, these aren't bad things, but don't expect an insect version of Broken Sword. The game is definitely worth playing if you find the art style intriguing. That's what drew me in, and it definitely delivered on that count. The gameplay is nothing to write home about, but with the art and presentation draped over it, it works. "

												Yes, I'd recommend it. But with a big but. I'd recommend buying it only on a sale (as I did); The game is extremely short and 1.6 hours Steam registred I played to beat 5 chapters should be about it (at least if I haven't screw something fircely and didn't see another whole act of the game, but I doubt it (...checked with howlongtobeat and yeah, there's nothing else after five chapters). Yes, the art is extraordinary, the gentle music and subtle animations make for a very pleasant zen experience, but I'd like a bit more to it. Nevertheless, apart from very slow walking animation (if it were as it should be for an insect crawling speed, the game would be at least some 10 min shorter...) those were 1.6 hours I enjoyed. At the time of writing, it's on -96% off and I don't see a reason not to. For a full price? Should be a bit longer..			"

I got it on sale for 21 cents from the steam sales, and originally thought it would just be an alt-tab out game and just farm the trading cards, but it turned into an actually decent and fun game. Pros: -The game was cheap-Gameplay was pretty fun-Puzzles that made you think hardCons: -Fairly short game-There could have been more explaining done for tasks.Overall is was a solid 8/10 game in my books, and should be in your steam library!

												Don't get this game just for the art! Game control is lousy and you can complete the game in 20min or less - once you figure out what you are doing. With no information or basic game play blurbs you'll be clicking randomly in hopes of finding the answer until you give up and go to Youtube to find basic mini-game controls and directive.			"

												3/5A Visual and Relaxing hour.Morphoplis is a point and click hidden object/puzzle game.  VERY EASY.  Don't expect much of a challange.  The game is more about experiencing the artwork and ralaxing story line.  There are no time limits and no lives. Just play and explore the art. You only need a mouse to play, and  it should take about an hour to get through all 5 levels. No story really, just play along.I wouldn't pay more than 50 cents on the game; but for that, it's worth it.			"

												I dont wanna give spoliers, but its a little creepy at the endings of all but hte last level if you think about it. Makes my bug phobia a hell of a lot worse, and it really doesnt need that. Other then that, its a simple game, not really boring, or anything, and the puzzels can take a little bit of time. its nice.Worth it if you like hide n seek type games. but its also only 5 levels long			"

												If you are like me, impatient, you really REALLY won´t like this game.+It´s graphics are pretty good, some puzzles are very challenging, game would be nice for kids I guess, and the concept of the game is good.-Your character (a bug) is pretty slow, sometimes you keep switching between screens because of the controls. The reason I do not recommend this game is because of that 1.9hrs on record, 0.70 hrs are all of moving my character.			"

												This game can seem quite complex due to the lack of a tutorial (all you get is a few hand indications at the beginning and then are expected to know what to do from there). Also, just a heads up, there is no explanation on how to solve the puzzles but if you tinker around you tend to figure them out for yourself. There are 5 levels that generally stay the same difficulty but only grow with more ""tasks"" (i.e. collect petals, etc). You're bug form changes with each level and does get some ""special abilities"" with the different morphs  (i.e. buzzing your wings to blow away petals so you can recover seeds, that sort of thing)  Overall, I would say its a 7.5/10Pros:-Beautiful scenery-Nice music-Decent conceptCons:-No explanations on how to solve puzzles (but if you play a lot of Artifex Mundi games you probably stand a better chance)-Extremely short (i got a perfect game in under an hour......)Ehs:-Movement is weird-You are incredibly slow which is probably to make the game last longer -What exactly are we doing to the giant bugs at the end of the levels?

												Very pretty but it doesn't work right. I think they should check to see if the game is going to work on a desktop with Vista before they put a game up for sale. Designers might also consider putting in an auto solve button where a player can just watch the computer put the petals of the flower in place. As it is I tried the first flower puzzle and wasn't sure the game was working right. Moving the caterpillar along the branch didn't work right. I couldn't get the petals to go where I needed them so I assume there's something wrong with the flower puzzle. I have a bunch of other games with horrible, awkward controls so why would a designer think I wanted to spend a lot of time fiddling and researching how to do the simplest thing with a 25 cent game? Just put in an auto solve button and let me use that. If I want to do it myself I promise I won't use the auto solve. Either that or make sure your game works right and has some adequate text to explain how to get things done.			"

												Morphopolis in a nutshell: an aggregation of  item search, puzzle,  and  interactive graphic novel . There is actually no story to speak of, by the time you play the first chapter, it may seem  vague  what the objectives are, and it will certainly be the case  the entire game . A little warning though, this game is not for everyone (especially if you aren't a fan of  patient, slow paced  games. But I'm sure some will be proselyted by the game's visual and auditory appeal.  8/10  "

												This game is a wonderful blend of gorgeous art/music and excellent puzzle gameplay. It's challenging in a good way. The levels get a bit repetative, but I still found it fun. The only annoying part is that the bug character you play as moves really slowly. If it could speed up a bit then this game would be perfect. I also wish there were more levels to play, as this ends rather quickly. -if you like point & click then you will like this game-if you don't like point & click then you will still like this game because it employs the style in a way that still is fun and challenging.

EditSeems like the price of the game has changed, and now it actually has a price that seems to fit better the duration of the game, so I decided to change the review to a positive vote instead.Original ReviewI really didn't know if give a thumbs up or thumbs down to this game.The graphics are awesome, the puzzles are entertaining and the music is very relaxing, it's an awesome game to spend around 2 hours (I finished it in 90 minutes) of relaxing puzzles and really nice looking draws.However, the game is really expensive considering the small amount of playtime it gives you, either they need to add more levels or you should get it when it's on sale, otherwise stay away from it since it will be money wasted.The game is awesome, but it's not worth the full price.

												I absolutely love this game.  It's simple, it's short, and it's very relaxing to play.  I finished the whole thing in one sitting and was left wanting so much more.  While I'm not typically a fan of the find-the-thing game category, this one was beautiful.  It's exotic, innocent, the art is great and the music matches it exquisitely.  I feel like I ripped them off for paying so little.  It's only good for maybe an hour or two of actual play time but good god it's fun while it lasts.  The only downside, and I say this with no disparagement, is that some of the puzzles are not self-evident.  This isn't usually too much of a condemnation except that the game provides virtually no instructions at any point.  Of course, there's Google.  If you're at an absolute loss, do that.  There's a brief how to move sequence at the very beginning and the rest is up for you to figure out.  That being said, just get it.  It's so cheap.  There's really no way to go wrong with this one.  Even if it was just an art and music pack without a game at all it'd still be worthwhile.  If I can pay a dollar for over an hour of childlike wonder then I just won and that's exactly what Morphopolis brings to the table in the most beautiful, multicoloured and delightful way possible.  It's such a beautifully and richly put together game that I can't recommend it enough.			"

												The game has very nice, psychedelic-esque graphics and the puzzles are of mildly difficultly. But on the down side the game-play is a bit boring - the insect (your character) moves really, really slow. So, to enjoy the game to it's fullest, I'd recommend getting high. ^^			"

												I bought this in a two pack with The Howler for like 89 cents and while the game is very short it has an awesome concept.  I kinda hate that the bugs move so slowly though and that there is no real tutorial.  There should be like a 2X speed button or something.  Nice puzzles, awesome artwork, and highly entertaining.  I have been playing for like 30 minutes and  am almost done.   Anyway - 3.5/5 - definitely worth the buy for 89 cents especially since i bought it for the trading cards.EDIT - 100 minutes from start to finish.   If you want to get the trading cards you have to play for more than 2 hours.  After the 2 hour period, you get one of the three possible drops every 30-60 minutes  =past the 2 hours (it means replaying the game.)			"

												Positives:-The music is very relaxing.-The art is pretty.-Some of the puzzles are pretty fun, and you feel pretty smart for having solved them.-Nice if you like ""find the hidden object""-type games.Negatives:-The controls for moving are crap.  Half the time you won't even realize you can go somewhere until you accidentally hold the mouse in the wrong area.  Other times, your bug keeps moving back and forth in the same spot as you try to find the place that'll make it go not just right, but right and downwards.  Sometimes you'll try clicking an object and end up moving your bug back over to the other screen for no apparent reason, even though you weren't clicking in that direction.-On a similar note, you are SLOW.  Slow, slow, slow, slow, SLOW.  Which wouldn't be SO bad, but since you're constantly moving back and forth between screens (using the same crummy controls) to find stuff you missed, it's just unbearable.  I feel like the game would have been at least a half an hour shorter if I could change screens faster.-So much random clicking to figure out what's important.  See, you don't actually find out what you need to collect until you click on something, like another bug, or a plant.  Sorta like they're giving you a quest.  Usually it's easy enough to figure out what needs clicking, but other times, you have no freaking idea how you're supposed to progress without taking a hint.-By level three, you'll start to recognize that the weird orange orbs are gonna need collecting before you can burrow into your next target's brain.  But no, you can't grab anything you know you're gonna need until after the 'quest' is given to you, forcing you to slowly, SLOWLY backtrack through all of the screens to grab them.  I don't mean to sound impatient, but God.  Crawl across the screen a little faster, bug.  Come on!  Hustle, hustle!-No idea where the ""pathways"" to the next screen are.  Have fun crawling (SLOWLY) across the screen, only to realize it's a dead end.  Then crawl (SLOWLY) back, not sure whether there's another screen, or if you're just bad at finding items.-Did I mention that you're slow?  Because you're slow.  SO FREAKING SLOW.-A couple puzzles are really annoying for the wrong reasons.  For example, the flower puzzle gives you no indication of the controls.  I spent ages clicking around and hoping something would happen, but nope!  It's actually a Chinese Checkers-style puzzle where you have to try and get all but one of the seed thingies to disappear, but without a walkthrough, I never would have figured out the rules and controls.  Figuring out what the freaking puzzle is isn't a puzzle.-No mid-level saves.  Levels aren't usually that long, but if you get stuck on something and call it quits for the night, have fun slowly, slowly, SLOWLY crawling across the screen several more times to complete the initial collection quests again.  SLOWLY.-I don't know if I just accidentally skipped it, or what (in which case it shouldn't be so easy to accidentally skip, because I'm not gonna freaking replay that last puzzle just to see it) but I went into the place I was supposed to go, and... That was it.  The game just ended.  I got an achievement, and then I was back at the menu.  Ghosts 'n' Goblins had a better ending than that!Summary:If you can get it on sale and really, REALLY like hidden object games, it might be worth it, but there are plenty of free games on the internet that aren't so, well, SLOW.  Seriously, I'm not kidding, it's really gonna get on your nerves.  Don't even think about paying the full five dollars for this.  I mean, I appreciate the effort the developers put into it, and everything, but this isn't worth two dollars and fifty cents per hour.			"

												Really interesting, the gameplay is so different. The overall feel from the game is kind of like Machinarium or Botanicula, very similiar. Playing Morphopolis just feels really wierd, yet calm and relaxing. Puzzles are simple, but stil difficult. Even tho It's relaxing, you still need to use your brain. The whole game is illustrated so beautifully, there is no free space on your screen, every single pixel on your screen has piece of art on it. I found Morphopolis, Gravilion and The Howler in ""Art Appreciation Pack"", that cost me just around 0.30€. If you want cheap, relaxing and really beautifull game, I would 10/10 reccomend you buying Morphopolis.			"

												Interesting game. Would recommend for people who like point and click puzzle games.Art was pleasant, yet weird to look at, not used to bright colors like these in games. Music was atmospheric and calming.100% in 1.3hrs on steam. Could probably get it under an hour with a decent walkthrough.Bought on -96% sale.9/10Won't give it 10/10 because it lacks some sort of reset button on some puzzles. Some have it, some don't.It's really confusing when you first start it but I'm guessing this is intended to make the player explore.Story/Spoiler (Something along those lines)You start with no information, you just click around and try to figure out what to do.Once you figure out what to click on you gain some sort of ""quest"" where you're supposed to pick up X of Y and when you got everything you progress in the level.The 5 levels are quite short but enjoyable.

												This game is very beautiful and has relaxing music but those are the main positives for a HOG. The hidden objects are not very intuitive in finding them, which isn’t a big deal if you don’t mind a challenge. The part I have an issue with, however, is the fact you can not save the game mid chapter. I spent quite a bit of time working on a chapter, then exited figuring it would save my progress just as any other HOG does, and when I came back I was back to the beginning of the chapter. Very frustrating. So, for a pretty HOG it’s good but for a game which is supposed to be relaxing, it is more irritating than anything.			"

												Seriously, if you want a nice and soothing experience, go watch a documentary on bugs. This, as a game, is seriously boring. Movements are slow as hell. Completing objectives is about clicking things around the stage and puzzles are basic. I take it you wanted to make a cool game to relax on while playing it, but god it is way too slow paced ! However I thought the music was doing its work, and I like the colors. But I didn't like the drawing - but that's ok, just not the style I like. Awful as a videogame though. Can't recommend this, even for free : too slow, too boring - I'd rather watch some documentary on ants or flies.			"

												As much as I enjoyed this game, it feels more like a demo than a full game. The atmosphere is right and some hint of a story is there but gameplay is a little uncomfortable (example: having to hold the mouse button to move the insect) and the ending is anticlimatic. Worth at least one playthrough though, and if this game were to have a sequel that were fleshed out and changed the controls a little, I'd certainly be interested.			"

												Another great value game that gives more time that the cost would indicate.  It is visually very nice and the soundtrack is really soothing.  Yes it is very simple, well, mostly; however, it is pitched at just the right level that it can keep you entertained.  The puzzles as well as the hidden object element are a nice touch.  My only gripe is that the movement can be somewhat annoying at times and there is no direction, so you really do have to feel your way around.  The value it offers more than compensates and is worthy of recommending.			"

												I would recommend considering the low cost, considering how beautiful this game is. The artwork is amazing, and the soundtrack's really good, and it's a nice concept. However, the bugs move super slowly, and sometimes it can be difficult to get them to go where you want, and some of the puzzles are a bit counterintuitive. So while the gameplay can be a bit frustrating, 10/10 for pretty.			"

EditSeems like the price of the game has changed, and now it actually has a price that seems to fit better the duration of the game, so I decided to change the review to a positive vote instead.Original ReviewI really didn't know if give a thumbs up or thumbs down to this game.The graphics are awesome, the puzzles are entertaining and the music is very relaxing, it's an awesome game to spend around 2 hours (I finished it in 90 minutes) of relaxing puzzles and really nice looking draws.However, the game is really expensive considering the small amount of playtime it gives you, either they need to add more levels or you should get it when it's on sale, otherwise stay away from it since it will be money wasted.The game is awesome, but it's not worth the full price.

												At $1 you can't go wrong (though I got this for like 30 cents during a weekly sale). It's a short hidden object game, only 5 levels, and quite relaxing...up until the final puzzle. I see others have made mention of the final puzzle as well. All the other puzzles are a breeze and shouldn't take much to get through, but the last one is a b****. It has 13 achievements and they are all easy to get, so if you are someone who likes 100% completing games, this one will make you happy.3/5 stars from me.			"

												TLDR: The art alone is worth the price of this game (especially on sale), but don't expect to be blown away by the gameplay.----------------------Long review:First off let me say that I love puzzle games, and I'm always a sucker for an artistic or atmospheric game, even if the gameplay is trivial. I was ready to love this game. Unfortunately it has some serious shortcomings that prohibit me from loving it.The art is amazing, we all agree on that. The artists spent a lot of time on it, and it's obvious that the whole team had a great idea for a game. The bad part is the controls. They are so bad. Like why, WHY can't I just use WASD to control the bug? Click and hold is terrible. Even if it's designed for touch screen, that is still a terrible way to move around. Frequently (the whole time) I would be clicking for an item, and accidentally move to the adjacent frame. Which you can't cancel, you have to wait for the animation, then go back to where you were. Super annoying. Also getting around the environment is not very intuitive, and it's not always clear that there are pathways to other areas. This could be considered a pro if you're into exploration, but the controls are so slow and annoying that it isn't fun at all to explore. Then many of the puzzles suffer from ♥♥♥♥ controls as well. The last puzzle was infuriating, and would have been pretty easy with proper controls.Which leads into another downfall... poor puzzle design. Some were good. The moth mosaic was very satisfying, and I would absolutely play a game consisting solely of that puzzle. Others were just straight up annoying or felt like busy work.In any case, this game is cheap, and it was worth it to me to support the devs with less money than I would give to a homeless person, even if it was for the art alone. I had some fun in the short amount of time it took me to beat it. I look forward to what they come up with in the future, and I hope that they manage the gameplay a little better for future projects.			"

												Not exactly sure what just happened but it wasn’t bad.Story:You’re a bug that needs to give eggs to a different bug and then in the next level you play it? I’m not sure if I understood that correctly but overall, no story.Gameplay:It’s a point and click where the objective is to collect things. You get quests by clicking on insects which tell you to collect things which open paths (sometimes) to other insects and collectibles. It’s a simple process really. The fetch quests aren’t too bad as the entire game is about exploration. At the end, you just move on to a different level. Each level has about 4 rooms and you backtrack a lot which isn’t too much of a problem as they are small but your speed is low. Controlling the movement of the bug seems really not that accurate but you usually just use it to move to a different screen. Sometimes there are mini puzzles that show up like connecting ropes, matching colors, or a literal puzzle. They aren’t too annoying but just seem like time lengthens (except the last one can go ♥♥♥♥ itself).Overall, the gameplay is simple and not that bad. Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game looks fantastic and maintains a solid 60. Everything seems handdrawn and the sheer detail is just amazing. However, there are black bars around the top and bottom which are annoying. There isn’t a setting menu for resolution, controls (although a mouse is all you need), or music which is annoying. The music itself is really nice and nature-y (?) while having a sense of foreboding. Final Thoughts:I liked it. It was different and interesting. Overall, worth a look although wait for a sale.			"

												I purchased Morphopolis while on sale for 25c. A really beautiful game, with a relaxing soundtrack. I didn't expect for it to pose much of a challenge, but I was WRONG!The gameplay combines finding hidden objects and puzzles, which ramp up in difficulty. The puzzles aren't terribly original, but enjoyable nonetheless. I would be more than happy to pay full price as it really is gorgeous. Definitely something enjoyable to take your time with.The only negative would be at some points what you actually have to do is unclear, there are no instructions, but there is a help button which recharges over time if you get stuck in the finding objects parts.

												I really wasn't expecting this game to be very good when I picked it up dirt-cheap on sale. The art style looked weird (in a good way) and the idea of playing as a bug (who crawls so bloody sloooow I might add) seemed a bit strange too. However, I'd just joined Steam properly (I made my account 6 years ago and never used it) and needed a few games to get me started. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It wasn't long at all. Five chapters/levels in total, each lasting around 15-30 minutes each, depending on your puzzle skills.   The game plays like a triple-mix of platformer/hidden-object/puzzle game, with the end-goal in each chapter being to evolve your bug to the next stage in it's life.  The puzzles are fairly simple, but some can become a bit tricky as there is no guide or text to tell you what you should be doing to solve each one. I would recommend this game to others,  as I had fun while it lasted, and the level design is very nice on the eye. Great work.			"

												Morphopolis is a failry fun little puzzle + hidden object game that has very nice artwork backed by decent sound effects. Unfortunately, some design issues make progression very tedious, making this a weak recommendation at best:1. There is no save, so if you just want to quit and continue at another time, prepare to start the chapter again.2. Your character moves far too slowly, and you're often forced to backtrack multitimes to pick up the 'hidden objects' so you can progress to the next puzzle or stage. The lack of savepoints just amplifies this tedium.			"

												Although some may commend it for its beautiful art style; the gameplay is infuriating, unrewarding, and far too slow for me to really appreciate all Morphopolis has to offer. There also isn't a menu where I can tinker with the sounds, which means I have to listen to that annoying bug chirp in the background for the entirety of the game.The controls are maddening. You click and drag your cursor in the direction that you want the bug to move, but unfortunately the controls don't always work. You'll find yourself dragging, only to watch your bug go back and forth. In certain points, you'll have to wait for an animation to finish until you can move your bug again - which can be upsetting if the controls are screwing up constantly. There is also tons of backtracking, which makes every level feel tedious. Since every level that you play seems to end with you collecting a serious of orange balls, I know that I am going to have to do that at the end, but I can't collect them all before I receive the quest. Subsequently, I'm forced to backtrack through every single level to collect all of the orange balls in order to go to the next level that will ask me to do the same thing.Backtracking wouldn't be that much of an issue if your character didn't trek along at the speed of molasses. The two hours that you'll spend completing this game could be cut down to about an hour and half if the bug would move just a tad bit quicker. Unfortunately, that never happens and you're forced to watch your bug move uncomfortably slow through every area - which can be upsetting if you're someone that enjoys gameplay that actually moves at an appropriate pace.Also, the last puzzle is a treat. By that, I mean, you'll be shouting at your computer screen and wondering why the hell anyone would develop a puzzle as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the one you're playing. In the end, Morphopolis is slow, boring, and unrewarding - the gameplay is too little movement, too much grinding and that's just no fun. I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Are you an entomologist or botanist who believes in reincarnation and enjoys hallucinogens? Have I got a game for you!Morphopolis is a hidden object type game with some puzzles thrown in intermittently. The puzzles are fairly typical, and not that difficult. I beat the 5 levels in about an hour.While a little psychedelic, the artwork is beautful. The music is also very nice.There are no words in the game, so I'm not exactly clear on the ""plot,"" but it seems to be about a bug that brings larger, dead bugs back to life and inhabits them somehow, which is curious and slightly disturbing, but just try not to focus on that part.All in all, I'd give it a 6 out of 10. Pretty, but otherwise pretty uninteresting. Get it on sale.			"

												full disclosure - i don't play hidden object games, and didn't realise this was one when i decided to play it next. i thought it was a puzzle game. i was wrong.i won't criticise it for it's hidden object content (though i do not understand the appeal at all) as it's unfair to mark down a game for being the genre it is. however, the other aspects are incredibly frustrating. the character model moves so slowly, which feels like unnecessary padding. pathing is terrible. there's no indication of where you can and can't go, so you have to wait an eternity for the character model to walk to a point only to find you can't go that way. the game doesn't explain any of the mechanics or puzzles - not an issue for the most part, but in 2 instances i had no idea what i had to do to move the game along and had to look at a guide to simply progress the game (oh, that mechanic that i discovered by accident that did nothing now does something in select spots on one single level? ugh). that's not clever game design.the puzzles were fairly bland - nothing that hasn't been done a million times before. but i have to mention the last one in the game...if you're colour blind, like i am - GOOD BLOODY LUCK. it was nearly impossible for me to distinguish some of the colours. terrible puzzle design.the music is nice enough, but loops too soon.visually - A+. absolutely beautiful to look at. just wish the graphics were married to a better game.

												PROS: - I bought it on sale for $0.13CONS: Where do I start?- took me just over an hour to complete the game (i had left it running while i went sammich hunting)- the art it werid and looks like some one on lsd made it- its not even hard!- people are comparing it to "" The Tiny Bang Story"" but honestly that game was way better, it was a lot harder and it at least took me a coupe of days to complete it.- the actual movement of your bug thingy is stupid and tidious. it takes forever for them to move anywhere and you actually have to raise your cursor up and down to go over a rock. its highly annoying.- and the storyline. WHAT IS IT!? i dont even know. all i know is to move onto the next level you have to find the missing pieces of the bug and then let your current bug be absorbed (for a lack of a better word) by the new bug. :/dont buy this game. soo many things that are just wrong with this. :/			"

												I'd have to describe this as ""a pretty poor game"". That is to say, ""it's pretty"", and ""it's a poor game"". I picked it up dirt cheap because my never-plays-computer-games girlfriend (and I) enjoyed Machinariam and The Tiny Bang Story, the advertised equivalents, but aside from the nice art style there was no comparison. She lost interest in under ten minutes, and I only persevered because I didn't want to waste my 20 cents...It's nice-looking, searching out the grubs and beetles to collect is about as entertaining as finding the goals in any other such game, and the occasional puzzles you unlock are adequate (though few), but the pointless requirement to click-and-hold on invisible paths to compel the insect to transition between screens was surely intended to draw out a game that could otherwise be finished in half the time. Naturally, you have to page back-and-forth to trigger new requests to satisfy, but making me wait doing nothing with the mouse button pressed was an annoyance. It didn't help that on my ageing PC the game often ran like a three-legged dog with terminal asthma; I finished it in 2 hours, but it could have been 30 minutes. This is five levels of hide-and-seek that offers no reward for the ultimate completion: beat the last puzzle, it just goes back to the level-selection screen and that's it. Literally no indicator that you've finished the game, other than the absence of a Number 6 to click on. Not even a pretty picture, and given that the art is this thing's only selling point that just seems lazy. It feels like something that was made by a team who watched games being played without ever playing one themselves. Nice art is not enough, not nearly.			"

												I'm going to give Morphopolis a lukewarm recommendation, because the artwork is gorgeous, and I'm a sucker for both point-and-click adventures and games with a unique visual style.  If those things sound up your alley, then definitely give Morphopolis a try.  I do have reservations though, as the game can become very tedious, as it basically consists of navigating very slow-moving insects between various screens as you look for hidden objects, and solving small puzzles.  The controls are also frustrating at times.  There are five segments to play through, but there is no real ending once you've completed the final puzzle.  Speaking of the final puzzle, it almost caused the game to lose my recommendation, as it is basically an annoying slider puzzle, and I really can't stand when these show up in games.  All of that being said, however, Morphopolis remains a beautiful, relaxing experience, and it's likely worth your time.			"

												So Morphopolis is like if Myst were a hidden object game about bugs. Also, short. While it's refreshing being able to discover the puzzles vs. having them explained to death before even getting to them, I do find the controls a bit strange, as though this was designed for mobile (maybe it is, I didn't check); after the second stage, everything starts to look like fetch quest items (they are); and I found the ""repair the plant"" puzzle slightly annoying because it's unclear how to solve even when you know what to do... plus, it emphasizes the weirdness of your quest to basically resurrect dead things.Still, it's very pretty (if you like bugs), and if you got it super cheap like I did, it's worth a playthrough.

												Really interesting, the gameplay is so different. The overall feel from the game is kind of like Machinarium or Botanicula, very similiar. Playing Morphopolis just feels really wierd, yet calm and relaxing. Puzzles are simple, but stil difficult. Even tho It's relaxing, you still need to use your brain. The whole game is illustrated so beautifully, there is no free space on your screen, every single pixel on your screen has piece of art on it. I found Morphopolis, Gravilion and The Howler in ""Art Appreciation Pack"", that cost me just around 0.30€. If you want cheap, relaxing and really beautifull game, I would 10/10 reccomend you buying Morphopolis.			"

												This is a really neat game. Quite short unfortunately, but if you see it on a sale for approx $.20, it's definetly worth it.I really enjoyed the graphics. They are well done and create a complete aesthetic feel.Controls are a bit glitchy, but after a while you are able to overcome any imperfections.My 6 y.o. daughter is able to play this after we did one playthrough together. She has hard time with one or two puzzles, but the rest is just right.			"

												I adore this game. It's so pretty! Just a very simple point and click, find the hidden objects type game. Click around the environment to be given objects to find, then once you've found the objects return them and be given a puzzle. If you're stuck, spam the hint button.I will say that your avatar moves kind of slowly which can get annoying, and that the ending is a bit anticlimatic. I don't care though because it is so beautiful. The objects and the puzzles are really just an excuse to enjoy the scenery. It's kind of psychedelic, kind of surreal...just really gorgeous. A game for those who love their visuals.			"

												I wanted to like this game and it has some beautiful aspects to it. The music is very well done and there is a lot of attention to detail. Unfortunately, I found it was very let down by the gameplay as movement is far too slow. The puzzles are not hard, but is is often not clear what is expected and ultimately, to me, they were rather dull. The colours are garish, and some of the confirmation noises are irritating. Worth picking up if in sale, leave it if not!			"

												The game has very nice, psychedelic-esque graphics and the puzzles are of mildly difficultly. But on the down side the game-play is a bit boring - the insect (your character) moves really, really slow. So, to enjoy the game to it's fullest, I'd recommend getting high. ^^			"

												Morphopolis, a beautiful hidden object game. ProsThe artwork is stunning, as an art piece, this game achieves everything I would want. The hidden objects are for the most part, fairly easy to indentify. allowing you to take in the artworkThe music slides into the background easily. ConsThe controls are rough. They work perfectly fine, but many times I found them rather counter-intuitive. You move painfully slow, and for many of the levels, you need to do a bit of backtracking to find objects previously obscured. Combined, this leads to a very relaxed, and on occasion too relaxed travel time. Overall, I loved it. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you enjoy the hidden object genre. However, if this is going to be your first forey into this style of game, put it on your wishlist, play some of the many more polished, and/or free games that are around. And come back to this one later.			"

												I absolutely love this game.  It's simple, it's short, and it's very relaxing to play.  I finished the whole thing in one sitting and was left wanting so much more.  While I'm not typically a fan of the find-the-thing game category, this one was beautiful.  It's exotic, innocent, the art is great and the music matches it exquisitely.  I feel like I ripped them off for paying so little.  It's only good for maybe an hour or two of actual play time but good god it's fun while it lasts.  The only downside, and I say this with no disparagement, is that some of the puzzles are not self-evident.  This isn't usually too much of a condemnation except that the game provides virtually no instructions at any point.  Of course, there's Google.  If you're at an absolute loss, do that.  There's a brief how to move sequence at the very beginning and the rest is up for you to figure out.  That being said, just get it.  It's so cheap.  There's really no way to go wrong with this one.  Even if it was just an art and music pack without a game at all it'd still be worthwhile.  If I can pay a dollar for over an hour of childlike wonder then I just won and that's exactly what Morphopolis brings to the table in the most beautiful, multicoloured and delightful way possible.  It's such a beautifully and richly put together game that I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Overall, do I recommend this game? Yes, I would just say wait till its on special though. I did enjoy my time with it. It was fairly easy, a god little time killer without being too full on. Just click and point to make your bug move, and collect the objects. Every now and then you'll have to do a puzzel (jump the seeds, make a puzzle, etc)The graphics are cute and the music is nice. However, the music gets really reptitive fast. I also did not finish - I gave up on level 5 with the bug body spinning thing. But, the controls were ""buggy"" (lol) and my little bug often got stuck (worst bits were level 4 with the branch in front of the bug guarding the hole, and level 5 going either up the wall or down into the cave).

												A maddening ""game"".  They most feedbackyou get is a grating and irritating ""dong"" when you try to do the wrong the thing. But there is no guide as to what you are supposed to do. Your avatar moves to slowly that you will have to fight the urge to fling your monitor across the room. Additionally, it will often decide to move entirely of it's own--you'll click on the image at the bottom of the screen and the game interprets this to mean that you wanted to move your bug to the top--and then locks all control while it sloooooooooooowly transitions to the screen above before you can click (IN THE SAME SPOT!!!) and then wait for it to sloooooooooooowly transition back down again.When I reached a point that nothing I clicked on worked, and the in-game hint button also ""dong""-ed at me, I decided I had enough. Save your money.			"

												I really wasn't expecting this game to be very good when I picked it up dirt-cheap on sale. The art style looked weird (in a good way) and the idea of playing as a bug (who crawls so bloody sloooow I might add) seemed a bit strange too. However, I'd just joined Steam properly (I made my account 6 years ago and never used it) and needed a few games to get me started. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It wasn't long at all. Five chapters/levels in total, each lasting around 15-30 minutes each, depending on your puzzle skills.   The game plays like a triple-mix of platformer/hidden-object/puzzle game, with the end-goal in each chapter being to evolve your bug to the next stage in it's life.  The puzzles are fairly simple, but some can become a bit tricky as there is no guide or text to tell you what you should be doing to solve each one. I would recommend this game to others,  as I had fun while it lasted, and the level design is very nice on the eye. Great work.			"

												Morphopolis is a failry fun little puzzle + hidden object game that has very nice artwork backed by decent sound effects. Unfortunately, some design issues make progression very tedious, making this a weak recommendation at best:1. There is no save, so if you just want to quit and continue at another time, prepare to start the chapter again.2. Your character moves far too slowly, and you're often forced to backtrack multitimes to pick up the 'hidden objects' so you can progress to the next puzzle or stage. The lack of savepoints just amplifies this tedium.			"

												Although a short game (I finished it in under two hours) it is definitely a fun game for those of you into point and click puzzle games. If not, maybe a nice introduction to the genre? The puzzles themselves are challenging without needing a guide to walk you through if you take the time to figure them out. More hidden objects are unlocked by finding other sets first. Visually appealing and a beautiful soundtrack, definitely worth picking up on sale if you want an easy 100% completion on achievements and some trading cards.			"
