												This is a fun game that's easy to get started with, but is challenging enough to keep you entertained (especially if you repeat levels to beat your own score). An interesting feature is that it supports local profiles, which combined with the very short levels (each one lasts 1 to 5 minutes) makes it a great party game.The graphics aren't triple-A level, but the overall it's fun, immersive and has good replay value.Disclaimer: I was given a free copy for this review			"
