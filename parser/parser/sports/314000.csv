Early Access Review
								Pool Nation FX is a Pool Simulation game that can be seen as an improvement to the original Pool Nation. I have a few things to say as to whether or not I would recommend the game or not.Positives:  It looks great. However, having spent so much time in the original game, at this stage in time...1.6 hours... I prefer the look of the original game compared to Pool Nation FX. But perhaps the new look will grow on me over time.  More content. Pool Nation FX features an all-new career mode which is a big improvement from the original Pool Nation. It boasts many new locations and the 'play with skill to win' approach makes single-player pool a joy to play. Snooker is a great feature in Pool Nation. Me and a friend had an enjoyable time and like the other modes, are great.Negatives: I think the speed of the cloth could be adjusted. Perhaps there could be a slider added to the game, or a 'slow' or 'fast' speed option could be implemented. My friend and I were almost always complaining how the speed of the cloth could be better. It is fair, yes, but variety will always be appreciated.  Setting up a game with my friend had been slightly difficult as my friend had a microphone switched on in the lobby but I could not find a way to mute him so I had ended up turning the whole game down in the mixer.  Compared to Pool Nation, aiming and potting has become a lot harder, with or without aim assistance. I wish as I was taking my shot that I could look down the table even further. I have been using the middle mouse button to aim the cue more vertically to line up the cue ball better... however, it is still difficult.I have been looking forward to Pool Nation FX for so long now that I cannot help but want any improvement the game can get. However, the game is great and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Also, thank you so much for the loyalty discount!Thank you, Cherry Pop Games!			"

Dont bother with free, buy the gameSo, first off I am using the free version of the game. I plan to buy it but I wanted to see the game from a free to play perspective first. When I first downloaded it, it was great and yes a lot of things were locked but a few games later I had some cash and was able to unlock some neat stuff.I don’t mind the free model where you unlock things by playing the game, it makes sense that those who play a lot have access to more content.The problem I have is the recent update: After the update a lot of good changes were made but also a VERY bad change was made. They changed the amount of money it costs to unlock many things. I’m not talking a small increase of 1k-2k here I’m talking a pool stick that was 5k is now 40k and the pool room I wanted to unlock for 4k (which I was only 300 away from before bed last night) is now 15k.This change has made it nearly impossible for any free user to make any progress unlocking the games features in any reasonable amount of time. Spending 4 days of grinding to unlock a single pool stick? I’ll pass on that.So, with that aside I would still suggest the game because it is damn fun and just like loading up in a real pool hall you never know who your opponent may be and it’s the challenge to outwit them. Good luck and have fun.-=-UPDATE-=-So, its been a while and i checke dback into the game. Online mode is seriously dead. Only one match up and the match i created saw no action for 20 min.			"

												Pros:- Sequel of Pool Nation, the best pool game in the planet, with more game modes.- Unreal Engine 4- Developers support and give attention to everyone in Steam forums- Unlimited FPSCons:- Campaign is very repetitive. The bonus matches are always the same, regardless the stage or game mode- AI sometimes is insane and impossible to win. This should be fixed.			"

												Pros:The game is very pretty.The balls behave well and there seems to be a lot going on in the physics part.Trick shots!No need to Chalk up.Can unlock vanity items using ingame currency instead of cash.Cons:Lite version of the game is basically nothing.Full version of the game is carved into Offline and Online, requiring two purchases. Why?Lite version of the game is practice 9-Ball...By yourself.If I wanted to play with a stick by myself I would probably visit a different website altogether. :P

												As a ""pool simulator"" it fails pretty horrendously, as a pool game its fairly decent, as an expierienced pool player I can tell you that the physics are fairly inaccurate, missing shots i can easily make in real life and it just does not feel very good, the power bar in my opinion is also not the best representation of how hard you will actually hit the ball and how far it will roll, and as far as the line guide, if you are a decent pool player in real life turn that off immidiately because it does not help at all, it is the worst line guide I have ever seen in a pool game by far, as far as just a pool game it is okay though I do not recommend paying anything for this, it is just not that fun missing shot's easily made on a real pool table, if you like pool games give it a try see if you like it, its always at least worth a try, but as for me I did not have any fun at all, mostly just frustration missing shots I know I can hit easily.

												This game is really a worthy succesor to Pool Nation. The controls are intuitive, the visuals are very impressive, and the new modes are very welcome. Only two real problems with this game, you have to tinker a bit with the graphics to get it to run smoothly, and two which is sorta minor is that they don't list the challenges for each particular match in the pause menu like they did in the original. This is really annoying when you forget them, but it's minor. I think the worst thing the developers could have done to this game is make it free-to-play. This invites the stereotypical freeloading gamers who think they're always entitled a completely free game and review the game negatively.  This is not how commerce works, so get over it! It's a great game for what it is, and ignore the majority of the negative reviews because they don't even bother to review the game itself.			"

												I don't really understand the bad reviews. I played it for several hours and it was great, lot of fun. The interaction with the other players is really easy and I made a new friend in the first few hours. They need to polish the aiming a bit, the camera angle for jump shot could be a lot better, but there is no ""game breaking"" glitch or bug. I suspect most of the ""pro pool players of the internet"" are those bullies super annoying in every pool hall, I wouldn't pay too much attention to their review. There is no ""pay wall"",  I played for 10+ hours without spending a dollar, the new maps and cues you get are really optional. I played the Yahoo pool games for several years and I can tell you this game is a great contender to become the next big thing in the pool scene.Let me break down the pros and cons;Pros: -Insane graphics, could be the best out there for a pool game-Great physic, it's not perfect, but then again, it could be the best physic out there for a pool game!-All the menus/UIs are super intuitive and user friendly-It's easy and quick to find a game, you can really start you game and play a pool game in a few minutes then do something else!-VOIP, it's well made, intuitiveCons: (I will really break down those so the developers know what I'm talking about, and other player will understand I'm not trying to ""demonize"" the game by no mean)-Lobby sucks, no really they do, they offer great amount of information and it's super user friendly, but they are missing lots of options. To my understanding you need the full version of the game to change some of the settings, but they don't tell you ""you can change this one, but you need  X dlc to change that other one"" they expect you to spam your mouse click and find out what's working. I don't like it, the lobby system need a revamp, structure wise no so much, but definitely function wise and we need more information.-The ""open microphone"" is terribly annoying, there is pros and cons to this function, but so far, after tabula rasa, all point bulletin then APB:Reloaded, after rainbow six : siege beta, comon if you build game you must be a gamer, if you are a gamer you already know other companies tried the open mic thing and it's not working, this is not real life and people do things they would not do in public while they are in front of their computers. I don't want to hear a guy beating his wife or farting or sniffing a line of coke while the match is loading because of the open mic.-9 times out of 10 the camera angle is great.  However, when it's wrong, it's hella wrong man... The jump shot and most of the trick shot are super sketchy to do, not because of the difficulty, but mostly because of the added difficulty thanks to the camera angle. In a video game, where you can't move your head around and inspect evereything, I expect they woud put some kind of arrow in the air to help you see where the ball will land after a jump shot. Keep in mind you can press ""O"" in the game to activate the ""overhead view"" which is great and fixing a lot of problem you could have with the game camera.			"

Early Access Review
								I have Pool Nation and spent many hours playing it and I did highly enjoy it. I never got round to writing a review for it because it wasn't a GOTY or a flop. It was a niche game with quite a nice gameplay.Pool Nation FX takes Pool Nation and adds several bits to it which Pool Nation didn't have but could have done well with.Straight off the bat, a new game has been added: Snooker. The other game modes from Pool Nation are still in FX but so far I can't find 8 Ball UK (which is red and yellow and a 2 shots rule), but 8 Ball is merely cosmetic seeing as rules are now customisable.Menus are suspiciously like Codemaster's DiRT Rally but are more clear to navigate than Pool Nation's.FX is currenty in Early Access which may be a concerning factor, however this does mean that they can do some things which are a bit off. The contols aren't as smooth and nice to handle in Pool Nation (I'm surprised why they didn't copy and paste the controls). Vibration of controllers doesn't actually work. All the icons are for the Xbox One controller (even though both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers are XInput as far as PC is concerned) meaning that users of the ""old"" Xbox 360 controllers might be confused.If you liked the first Pool Nation, FX is for you. If you thought the first Pool Nation was a little lacking, FX fills in the spaces. If you didn't play the first Pool Nation, take a look at FX if you're into Pool/Snooker.			"

												Lazy Dev, Broken Game, Broken PromisesDon't bother with leagues. You get 1 loss recorded for every game you enter and 3 losses per loss. It's completely unplayable. The dev doesn't care and won't admit anything.Don't bother with snooker. The physics are broken, and the shot guide doesn't work. Again, the dev doesn't care.Don't bother reading the forums. Every bug somebody posts is taken down and replaced with praise from brand new accounts.Don't bother playing the ""for cash"" games. The game takes your currency, then doesn't pay out when you win. The dev won't admit this issue, even though it's all over the forums.Don't bother changing your settings. The game doesn't remember half of them. The dev won't admit there is a basic issue and won't fix it.Don't even bother playing on practise mode by yourself. WHen you rerack 9/10 times the game crashes.Don't think about multiplayer, either. Half the time people crash out, and the rest of the time in the middle of a shot the game starts forcing you to move in one direction, making play impossible. Oh yes, and don't think the game you think you are joining is displayed correctly, or think that the money the game is worth is correctt. I joined a 100 bet game and lost 2000 after I won it.Performance is shocking, a light years behind the last game whilst looking worse.The menus stutter and lag, with HEAVY mouse accelleration that can't be turned off.Don't bother playing. Cherry Pop, I used to love your games. You should be completely ashamed. You've become the kind of developer that shouldn't be allowed to exist.Update: In March the developer came on and PROMISED IN WRITING to ""personally address every single one of my issues."" It is now mid June, nothing was ever done and the developer has given up on the game and moved onto a spin off snooker game on early access (and we all know what that means)			"

								Pool Nation is back and better than everPool Nation FX quite simply Improves on its predecessor in every way possible. Returning with a deeper career mode youll find yourself traveling around the entire globe competing in various competitions and nationals along the way. The Unreal engine brings the photo realistic locations and tables to life and the physics engine is tweaked and polished to perfection.Snooker makes a much needed appearence and even includes a career mode for when you need a change. Theres virtually every game mode tweak and rule set you could wish for, Online play is flawless and provides a wealth of options to match you skill set. Even the soundtrack is improved.In short Pool Nation FX improves the original in every way and is a game i highly recomend. Buy this game and show the developers your support. An amazing game by an amazing team.			"

												Without paying for DLC you are forced to play online and win games to earn cash or grind 3 years (literally) of daily challenges to open meaningful content.There are not many people making lobbies, and when you open one there is no telling how long will you wait for an opponent. It might be seconds but it might be ten or more minutes.Camera control is not so good, when you wanna check your aim from different angles you will consume a lot of time. For snooker this gets triple longer (about 90 sec for every difficult shot) cos you need to refine your aim very well. This can make your opponents frustrated. And it will make you wait if they are really trying to aim...While this game looks great, plays well, and looks like a very solid development effort, instead of paying for convinience, lot of the game is locked behind paywall in reality.Don't expect free game, expect a demo for free, and if you like it, than pay to unlock it. It might be worth it. But the grind in free version is impossible.			"

												Pretty fun game. I play Pool alot on a miniclip app on my mobile. And this is kind of the same except a PC version meaning better graphics. There is the downside of the 'Free to play' part though. It's free to play pretty much nothing. You can play the game without spending a penny. But you'll be stuck in practice mode playing against yourself. Because as far as i could work out you can't play against AI. Meaning to play with friends you'll need to buy the Access all area online addon. Which is £2.69. Nothing really. But i'd rather they just put the game up for £5 and give me access to everything. It does have Snooker though, which is a bonus for me. As me and my friend play it alot now. Although simply for the fact this isn't Free to play i'm going to have to not recommend this. Just expect to end up paying money if you do download it.			"

Early Access Review
								I think the most important answer hidden in reviews of Early Access games is the answer to the question: ""Is this game worth of buying at this stage of development?"" In my Early Access review of Pool Nation FX I'll try to convince you that in this case the choice is easier like never before in the whole Early Access games history.LOVE POOL...The pool love story all begun in the biblical Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve were happily potting under a cherry tree very first balls. Yes, it was all about cherries from the beginning. And then God said: ""You can pot every ball except the apple-red one and you'll be enjoying the game of pool for the whole eternity."". But as soon as God left, Eve lost by her own desires potted the THAT ball, just because it matched her lips (she was eating strawberries for a moment before). Since then we have to pay membership's fees in our pool clubs while we light-heartedly could play whenever we wish to under every cherry tree in the world...LOVE POOL NATION...Released in 2013 first instalment of Pool Nation was true revelation. After years of waiting since I guess late '90 or even more ancient times of Age of Amiga we finally got a true, uncompromising pool simulator, Pool Nation. It was honest attempt build on real code-craftsmanship without any help of big brands or names. Just a group of brave enthusiasts realising their bright vision. They managed to achieve the impossible - combining the perfect gameplay experience with stunning graphic. Since then Pool Nation maybe isn't only pool game on Steam any more but still is leaving any competition far behind and now we even got the sequel, Pool Nation FX.One could wonder whether creating a sequel has any sense or that the developers can make it significantly different to give Steamers owning Pool Nation reason to buy Pool Nation FX. We all know how it ends in other sport games franchises, year after year only few cosmetic changes, small updates here and there and here you go ""dear"" gamer, a receipt for a ""new"" game. I must admit, I was really afraid. I'm with this franchise since the beginning and had a lot long hours of fun through last two years but it also created even more expectation towards Pool Nation FX. What made the matter worse for me, it was Early Access. I simply don't buy ANY games released in this way. But I've already seen what Cherry Pop team is capable of and had that strange feeling of the need to believe in them. The fact that Pool Nation FX needs Early Access mostly for developing/adding even more features that it already has became the decisive break I needed to buy it.When I first time launched it I experienced something truly wonderful. That evening I intended only to check it out, adjust some settings... but it was impossible. For almost four hours I was fighting with this game, it hugged me so strong and didn't want to let me go:D. It was like a Christmas, those very first ones you remember from your childhood. Every piece of main menu was like yet another present box you were opening with blushes on your face and there was so many of them!:).They really did it! Our beloved developers from Manchester made Pool Nation FX much, much more better simulator than ever has been seen and since it's Early Access it represents Cherry Pop's teaminvitation for full of attractions journey through Poolchester in luxurious VIP compartment. You might ask what they could possibly do more? What could be done more in game of balls and cues? The answer is: a lot. Of course I'll try not to rob you now from the chance to experience as much as possible of it for yourself - the precious thing about new game.The Pool Nation FX's biggest asset is naturally brand new game engine. Unreal Engine 4 makes all the difference for game's mechanic and looks. It was brilliant move, perhaps even Top 10 of the best decisions of Cherry Pop studio's history, one not far away from founding the company itself. Building such specialistic game type like simulator requires solid grounds and Unreal Engine 4 provides them with no doubt. Picking new engine allowed not only fulfil all the current ideas and gave balls more freedom but also it left a window of opportunities opened for future development.When it comes to games with brilliant gameplay, especially the simulators, visuals really don't matter. But... how possibly one could skip it in caseof Pool Nation FX? You remember like I was writing that Cherry Pop achieved something impossible (ok, at least almost impossible;)? Normally it ends in making a harm to gameplay or visuals, very rarely those two ""elements"" are mixed in even proportions. The certainly impossible part is that Pool Nation FX is made in a way of classic, perfectionist, oldschool times. Pool Nation FX simply looks so lovely! Realistic balls, magnificent cloth (ah those charming zooms)... Just look at the screens or clips... You just have to see it in action. Such fantastic masterpiece painted with high quality textures bewitches with its very classy kind of beauty. It's hard to believe that all data files of this game weights less than a half of the weight of files from the first Pool Nation (SDD enthusiasts standing ovation for Cherry Pop please;), multi-TB HDDs owners please stop boo-ing;)) and we're getting a game so many times better than its predecessor, yay!:) And with all those crazy high resolutions and no FPS lock there's so much place for even more visual magic. There's quite a lot options too (in still increasing number), not only graphic ones but also those such as FOV, Cue Distance, 2 camera types (manual and TV) etc.. Of course Pool Nation FX isn't bug free, but hey it's barley a week in Early Access and honestly there truly isn't nothing worth of mentioning. All modes listed above on Steam Store page are working fine and eventually encountered bugs are just details and definitely not disturbing ones. Plus Cherry Pop team is extremely devoted in making this simulator better with every day.BE PART OF POOL NATION...I simply can't find a single reason to not to enjoy this title from the beginning of its existence. Early Access games always are a certain risk, but you, dear fellow Steamer have to look at Pool Nation FX differently. By owning it now you not only will be able to enjoy highest class addiction but you'll also become a part in history of this one and only, the best pool simulator on this planet. There's other thing too. Pool Nation FX needs you, yes you!:), me and many others to become the ultimate solution for all our pool needs. Your input dear fellow Steamer is so important because will help to make this simulator our game. Everyone can leave in this piece of code ones mark. Participation in Early Access doesn't reduce itself to reporting bugs. You're becoming a tool (in a positive way;) ) which helps to sculpts the future of digital pool.Gemma, Brad, Matthew, Mike are people on a quest. They aren't typical developers team. They are fantastic group of ultra nice people. Just read some of theirs posts, announcements or even try to contact with them directly!:). You'll find out soon enough that they are very open to community, willing to listen everyone's suggestions and all kind community's support is more than welcome in Cherry Pop studio. They working hard on fulfilling their ambition of creating a pool game which is undoubtedly perfect, which has it all, everything that we're hopping to find in one. I'm sure as true pool fanatics they'll never forfeit the fight, but they need us, they need our support, our faith. I deeply believe in them and you?LOVE POOL...LOVE POOL NATION...

												Better than pool nation; most of the negative reviews here are because people are playing the lite version and not buying the full version...  from my perspective this is still meant to be a buy to play game (similar to guild wars 2 going free to play, but still needing to buy for full experience) so I see nothing wrong with the ""pay wall"" and bought the game immediately before playing... It's a great pool game, best on steam... doesn't deserve all the negative reviews for the previously mentioned reason.			"

												I'm so glad this 'Lite' version existed - with only 10 minutes on record, I think you can guess why.I have the original Pool Nation, which doesn't have the best UI in the world (almost every menu has a 'select' button, which can mean anything - eg after every match, pressing select means 'go back a menu')The UI for Pool Nation FX is a like a cross between a pub restaurant menu and a jigsaw - it's all over the place. Terrible.There's no 'launcher' this time too, to select your system settings before loading the game, instead it just fires up UE4 and auto sets everything to 'Epic' - good luck getting anywhere near 60fps with that!Admittedly I didn't spend long with the controls, but compared to the original, they felt cumbersome and heavy.Finally there's the addition of all sorts of bloated gameplay elements like in game currency etc.Even though the original Pool Nation has been pretty much abandoned, it's still a way better experience - it just needs loads of people to play online! (add me if you ever fancy a game)			"

												Great pool with lots of game modes and many people playing online. Beatiful graphics. (If you can run Witcher 3 on medium, you will be able to see all the beauties of Pool Nation FX. People complaining about performance should go and update their PCs at last). But do not treat Pool Nation FX as a free-to-play game. Think of it as of $8 game and do not judge it without buying two «Access All Areas» DLCs. Without them Pool Nation is just a poor demo to check graphics and controls. The controls, by the way, is OK most of the times. Camera is sometimes ”clumsy‘, but the overview view (“O” key) allows to aim more precisely.In general, this is the most beatiful pool simulator in Steam and there are always people to play online. So, if you are looking for a game to play for a few minutes just to relax between more serious game sessions (or don not have time for serious stuff), Pool Nation FX is your choise.			"

												The graphics are fine, the general performance is fine, the interface and playability is crap!It has one of the most confusing menu systems I've ever seen on a game. Trying to just play a game with someone seems to take forever to try and organise.The control is what finally kills it for me.  You aim, and then switch to top view and then to ball view, and then try and set you spin etc and all this requires 3 to 4 different views.  It takes seemingly forever to set up any real shot, and even then the actual control is still very poor.The crunch is this game is a low end game design to suck thos micro and not so micro transactions out of you to enable you to actually play it.Give this game a miss!

								Pool Nation, the best top notch pool game, finally has a successor and i'm not surprised it's Pool Nation FX. Unreal Engine 4 looks just great and fits to the game very well. There are some minor bugs, but it's still on early acess, and bugs are kinda ""soft"", nothing gamebreakable :)I loved Pool Nation gameplay and controls, physics and possibility to perform awesome tricks. Pool Nation FX improves every aspect of it's older brother and it' pretty addictive. I just hope for more players, online mod is not much crowded at this moment.Verdict: well crafted pool game for a very good price, recommended to anyone who like pool games :)			"

												I looked at the recent reviews of this game and kinda perplexed why people downvoted the game for seemingly random reasons. So eh, I said  to myself why didn't I try to play by myself and review this thing?A bit background info, I have never had any real Pool (IRL) experience except some fun games with friends, so I can't say from professional's point of view about how the physic or ball movement or rules work.For this price point (approx 8-9 USD in my region), you get a pretty pool game graphic-wise, both offline and online experience, daily quest and the standard controller support, Steam Cloud + Achievements + Cards. Pretty much fair considering you can choose so many modes in addition like: - You can play campaign/career mode against AI, - Endurance mode where you try to slot in the balls faster than the game puts in your table, - Free practice mode (9 balls, 8 balls etc) - recommended if you want to get a feel of the ball or shooting practice, - Versus mode (hotseat) to play against your friend next to each others, - Online modeThe control is nice and easy even for pure amateur like me. There's a tutorial to help you understand the game and AI is adjustable so you don't get smashed and fall into despair pit when you play the game for the first few hours. Performance wise, I slide up everything to max and I still get silky smooth experience on my toaster-like laptop (5200u + 840m). There's an annoyingly long loading times every time you enter new match or load up the game but I'm sure it's fixable by adding up SSD for the game files (I'm using the good old SATA). The game doesn't give good impression when you alt+tab to do something else though, as it actively consumes your CPU's power. Not sure if this is Unity behavior or just the game being poorly optimized  in this regard, as another Unity game like Teslagrad sleeps just fine in background mode.For the sound aspects, frankly my personal preference is to play this game without sound except the balls bouncing against each others, but the default in-game sound roster is not bad. Not memorable, but not bad. For this type of game it's the gameplay that matters most, but maybe it's just my personal taste.Developers seem to take a good care of this game and put an effort into fixing things. I personally had crashes that I reported to them when playing but it looks like it got patched and my issue is now non existent. At least unlike many developers who abandon their game, this one doesn't look like one.All in all, the game is ok - fun to play even for pool noob like me. I can't say this is the best pool game ever, as I haven't even played THAT many pool games, but yeah, it's a nice game to play.			"

 This is a hard one to review as there are so many variables involved...  TLDR - Graphics: 10/10 | Controls: 9/10 | Audio: 4/10 | Gameplay: 9/10 | Developer Commitment: 10/10 | X-Factor: 2/10  This review is based on buying Full game with all DLC during Holiday Sale for ZAR100 / USD9  Graphics: The visuals are awesome... definately can't fault anything here. (on 980GTX / 660GTX and 540M (Mobile) Controls: Controls are great. Reason for giving this a 9/10 is due to the 'console' generation of controls and GUI which could have been a lot easier to navigate through. Would still love to know how to access my 2 shot replays (lightening bolts) otherwise the rest of the controls are well documented. Audio: The audio quality is perfect but the reason for this being 4/10 is the limited midi instrumental soundtrack which gets a bit monotonous after a while and for me, personally, there is a female laugh which cycles every 10 seconds or so which also gets a bit grinding after while. These individual volumes are all adjustable and you can always run mediaplayer with your own beats. Gameplay: There is only so much the game of pool can really offer yet the developers have created heaps of different content from trickshots, multiplayer live matches to career mode. Personally, I will still play ocassionally with mates but doubt I would ever hit the 50 hour mark. Developer Commitment: To be honest, I have never seen a developer more involved in the 'Negative Review' community than Cherry Pop.This however can also be their biggest problem. X-Factor: Where to start...An over committed dev ('we listen to the community' style) has both positive and negative attributes.Making this a F2P game was a mistake. It just doesn't fit the model of a successful F2P game.Obviously this was adopted to increase the database of online players to counter-act complaints of 'servers are dead' by game purchasers. We all know that the development of a game costs ... yet for some reason its always the F2P that write all the negative reviews ... These should be labelled 'Demos'. Would I purchase at this very moment 13/01/2016?  No probably not. If you take the dev/community out of the equation, I would definately buy this game again without hesitation.As of right now it seems the F2P version would be the better choice if you enjoy a casual game of pool.Seems like the developers are pretty much unlocking everything besides online play in F2P version.A positive is the fact that a F2P can access all the content when playing with a game purchaser.I'm interested to see what transpires here wrt dev vs community interaction.

												Played this for only about 30 minutes before I decided that it wasn't for me.Controls are clunky with my mouse, often takes too long to aim the stick properly; the 'tutorial' are just messages that pop up whilst you're in the 'first' game/practice, it's finicky at best (a shot at 25% power suddenly sends my ball soaring across the table like I hit it full-force) and I couldn't play with my friend in online mode because you can't play with your friends unless you buy the online access pack!

Early Access Review
								Is this game worth buying ? There's a short answer to that question: absolutely (with a few annotations regarding improvements). First of all, the game is not hard to play if anyone is worried about that, as the controls are quite simple, yet sufficient for cueing with more precision. Truly anyone can learn to play pool with this game. Secondly, the graphics are beautiful (if your pc can handle the game at the maximum settings of course, although the system requirements aren't really demanding). The locations in which you're able to play are stunning and decorated in great detail to fully immerse you into the setting. There are numerous cues, ball sets and even decals to choose from (if unlocked through playing the game), wich give you the ability to personalise your game. Great lighting effects and realistic sounds add even more to this emuneration.I need to mention, however, that there's still room for improvement. When the ball(s) have been cued the edges of the ball(s) seem to deform slightly when looked at from a (greater) distance. It may be due to anti-aliasing, I'm not sure about that. Besides, it would be great to have a few more camera angles to play with aside from the two that are currently available. The physics could be better as well, as it nearly seems as if the balls roll across a grass surface rather than a table. The balls seem to come to a halt too soon, but I might be wrong about that.My overall opinion about this game is very positive, especially when you take the fact into consideration that the game is still in the alpha stage. Keep up the good work and try to fix the bugs and alterations I mentioned before, please :)			"

												Pretty nice game. Really! But....The lack of sense in the way the developers decided to make some of the features playable is totally destroying this game. Let's take the season mode for the beginning. If you start with the Season 10 mode, you probably will play against some person, that is way over your own level. That wouldn't be a problem, if you had fair chances (like aiming help off), but there is stuff forced in the settings, that is kinda stupid (Extended Aiming Help). The community is telling the devs, that this is not a good choice and they even listen to that. But after a couple of months there wasn't one change to that. There was other stuff, that annoyed me, too. But pointing that out is not really necessary. I can't recommend this game, until the devs have changed the damn Season modes and included a Level Cap setting, where you exclude people, that are too many levels above you, so you have at least a little chance to win. To-Do:- Level Requirements Settings (from-to)- No Aiming Help in Season Mode- Change of the Season Mode itself (make it more realistic)- Tournaments (Seasonal with great prices)- Noob area- Pro area- Master areaUntil that stuff is changed, I won't come back to this game.

												I bought full version of this game (while on sale) because ""Lite"" mode is nothing but a crappy demo. What you get is an online billiards game with nice graphics and gameplay simliar to any other billiards computer game. Its very basic with the exception of the wonky shot modifications. They have some sort of cash system that looks like it was thrown together overnight and can only buy things that were already included in my copy of the game. There is some single player mode which is very boring. Occasional crashes and an odd bug here or there but this is a mostly functional game.Overall if you arent looking for anything more than a basic online pool game this might satisfy you. For me it just feels... unfinished.Note: Finally sank an 8-Ball on the break. 8-Ball gets reset like nothing happened. Woohoo!			"

												Decent Snooker and Pool Sim.Is it different enough from Pool Nation to justify a rebuy? probably not, the gameplay is virtually identical to the earlier title, so I'd think twice if you already own that, unless you have friends who play this one.  There are some differences, you can customise the rules for pool, so me and my friends play the ruleset we are used to use in real life at the pub, (down table on free ball, behind the line, two shot carries etc)The new venues are nice, and there are people around so it appears less barren in the venues even if it is generic cookie cutter character models with canned animation and stock ""chatter"" on a loop.

												Verry verry poor UI but great graphics. Can only adjust inversion settings for Y-Axis but not X-axis. Once in the pause menu  actions you make with your mouse e.g pointing or clicking and dragging affects gameplay behind the menu. So in effect when you access the menu UI you are still controlling the gameplay at the pool table with your mouse actions. I was searching everywhere for where it said ""Resume game"" of something of the sort from the menu UI but nope, it doesnt not exist. I also tried pressing every key on the keyboard to see if it one would exit the menu UI but again no success. I had to quit the game twice becuse I couldnt figure out how to exit the menu and get pack to playing in practice mode.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm hooked. I really enjoyed the original Pool Nation. Some people wondered why the devs seemed to go silent, but its because they were too busy bringing their awesome game to Unreal Engine 4. The graphics are better, the physics are better, more game modes, including Snooker (Which I have no idea how to play but everyone has been asking for it).Being in early access, you can expect a few problems. I had a crash trying to play the daily challenge (and couldn't play again without using up prize money), and my time records in Endurance aren't being recorded. Also, Borderless Window doesn't center the game window on the screen, causing a bit of the game window to be cut off. But other than that, things are pretty smooth already.  It may be in early access but it is totally worth its price tag, especially if you own the original. Many of these issues have since been addressed, and so I highly reccomend it. There aren't many people playing online right now, but I find that really puzzling, because it's such a rock solid pool sim. It's the perfect game to pop on when you want to relax, and it's even a good pick if you don't have a lot of time, because most pool games don't take very long.P.S. Devs, please add an American English option. Some of the terminology in the text is a bit awkward to me			"

								Highly recommended. If you liked Pool Nation, this is that, with a new engine, better graphics, new music, additional snooker mode *that I know we wanted in the original*. Some complain about day 1 DLC, usually I would agree, but this is pure cosmetic, and can be unlocked for IN GAME money. So if you really do not want to buy the DLC don't, I did and do not regret it, but as I said, it is unlockable. Some gripe that some features were promised in the original, I am not recalling that exact promise, but I know it was something to look for *in the future*, and here it is.  I think a updated release is well justified here, and I am quick to burn Devs for re-releasing without real progress, but I think this is real progress. I *dispise* early access, and buy very few games that are early access. This game is a fully working game, with in progress development, and THAT is the right way to do early access, so Cherry Pop gets my money and approval. On top of all this, both Pool Nation and Pool Nation FX are quality products with value pricetags. Nobody should be complaning on that level. Please keep up the good work Cherry Pop, and gloss over the sour notes of some, but do listen to valid concerns and suggestions.			"

												I play ~25 Years Pool Fun Games / Pool Simulations and i will try to write a honest Review.First of all in my opinion there is a wrong game description in the shop: ""Pool Simulation with an incredible physics engine"". Sorry but i think this is wrong. PNFX is not an Simulation - it is a funny Sports Arcadish Game with poor physics but awesome good graphics, shiny balls and good looking locations. The good graphics is ok when you like it, but in reallife you will never see this kind of effects.Since the change of the pricing model you can play for free with the lite version, this is a good decision by the dev's.To unlock all areas of the game you can purchase some bundles or purchase the full version.When you will play a funny sports arcadish game with bad physics but good graphics then purchase this game.When you are a huge fan of Pool/Snooker and you LOVE simulate a real pool/snooker table on a PC then spend no Money for this game. You can check out a REAL Pool/Snooker Simulation here on Steam. Good luck for further development.			"

												Picked the game up during the winter sale after some friends recommended it, and I'm glad I did. It obviously has some bugs that need to be worked out, but don't be too quick to judge it. It play it casually with my friends, I don't take it too seriously, and I have fun every time. I'm only writing this review because honestly, it needs some more positive ones. I was shocked when I looked into the negative reviews to find someone complaining that the game is ""pay to win"". That statement couldn't be farther from the truth in my opinion. The only thing you pay for in the game is customization (which there is a fantastic amount of), and it's all payed with using in game currency. Just off the top of my head, there's probably  6 or 7 different game modes which are all fun in their own way, with the classics like snooker, 8 ball, and 9 ball being my favourite. Having just partook in my first tournament after reaching 24 hours in game, and playing against certain friends, I can also say that there's a fantastic amount of variety in player skill that you can come across playing the game. Lastly, only being an occasional pool player IRL, I can't vouch for the physics, and I can't knit pick them and tell you how bad they are, because I honestly whouldn't know. (Oh, and the upcoming patches sound like they're going to improve the game even further, and make it even more enjoyable).So, if you're looking for a solid, rather customizable pool experience to casually play with some friends, and have a good time doing so, for a relatively fair price, pick the game up and give it a shot.

												So buggy and badly optimised it's barely playable.Developed by established liars, who skip from one abandoned title to the next, recycling content as they go.The supposed free version is nothing more than a single player demo. But, as proven so often in the past, Cherry Plop lack any degree of dignity or class.Quote: ""A visually stunning pool simulation with the critically acclaimed POOL NATION physics engine.""  *Which translates as* ""We just released what should have been an update for the original Pool Nation as a paid title to steal money from you, and now we're going to chop out the only new feature we added and rerelease THAT as an ADDITIONAL full paid snooker title.""F*** Y** Cherry Po0p.

												First off I don't play pool and I hate golf.  Why would I say that? Well I have several golf games that I just like to play. They are excellent and make me wish I enjoyed the real game more.  I don't play pool, no one ever taught me the game and I never had access to a real pool table.  This game though, makes me wish I did.  Wow it is truly just a fun game.  Even in this game I am not that good but really enjoy it.  Is it worth a try?  Yes, but don't just judge the free version if you like it you will love the full version. Is it worth two Grande Lattes at $3.65 each?  (cost during winter sale) Yes it is, you will have more fun playing this than looking cool at the coffee shop.  Is it worth 3 Grande Lattes?  Absolutely, you can buy the game, play it at the coffee shop and look cool.  Now that is a bargain and more fun than pretentiously pretending to write your magnum opus of a screen play with your computer that has an apple on it with a chunk bit out.So stop writing your crappy screen play which will just end up going straight to DVD any way, buy this game and have some real fun with your Hipster friends at the coffee shop.

												A lot of the negative reviews here are due to Early Access buyers being confused (and admittedly poor messaging at the beginning from the devs) on release, regarding F2P and the purchase of Offline or Online only packs. This is a fantastic Pool game (and Snooker too!) from what i've played so far, with a good number of players online (there was a region issue on release, not anymore). Please don't let the impatient raging masses put you off. Being able to buy the game for cheap if you only want to play online is a great option i'd like to see more of. The F2P element involves letting you play online, as much as you want, but only in 8-ball pool. You then pay to play all the game modes, and it's cheap, so I don't see what the issue is. Anyway, if you like pool games, this is the best i've played.			"

												this is the best pool game i have ever played and ive played almost every pool game there is. i like that its free to play online and most of the basic features are available for free. you can play online for ""in game"" money and not loose any money at the same time. ( default online games are $0 to enter and $25 if you win ) and you can place bets for more money if you want, the graphics are beautiful. there are losts of different cue's and balls and tables to unlock and they are very nice. some are free already and then you use your money to buy stuff. you can practice to your hearts content and the physics and shot lines are very good. very fun game to play. i plan on buying stuff with real money because i want to support these people, excellent game!! and you can use a controller if you want+++. P.S. my only complaint is that when playing online there is a shot time period that doesnt give much time to figure out, and do what you want to do. maybe its different in some different game modes like league and torniment i dont know at this point, but just basic play online there is a ""shot time"". i assume they do this so people dont sit there forever doing whatever. but if they would just employ a system that allows you to "" contest "" a shot that is taking forever, meaning if the other person for whatever reason doesnt do anything for a time, then you can "" contest "" it and if the other person doesnt respond in a short period of time then you automatically win the game.

												This is essentially the updated version to one of my favourite games: Pool Nation - but with a useful online lobby and more game types. If you loved Pool Nation you will love this. The handling is essentially the same. I was able to jump right into online mode without problems. Best pool sim I've ever played. So far no technical problems. I have no idea why this is not rated better. Keep up the good work and to many more great updates. Congrats to Cherry Pop Games.The only thing I am missing is the cool music of its predecessor. Would it be possible to integrate some of its predecessor's fantastic music, Cherry Pop Games ? (... and maybe for the cam to stay in overhead mode when it's the opponent's turn)			"

I´m sure the game is just as fun on PC BUT it takes a pretty decent computer to run it in an acceptable fashion.Don´t get me wrong, the description tells you up front that you need a good computer, just wished i read that before my purchase.I usually play World of tanks and other games on my laptop on low but acceptable settings so i just figured a pool game wouldn´t be an issue. I was wrong.Look at recomended speccs before you purchase. The game looks horrible on low settings and is everything but smooth running on any setting on my laptop.GFX with 4GB of ram for a pool game?My thumbs down should be considered in the context of not beeing able to play the game in any enjoyable way on my computer.

												Note: Playing Lite versionFree to play online pool game with voice chat. Play to earn extra modes.The wall is a little steep for earning - you get $25 for each win, you start with 2000.Lowest unlock is 5000. So you're going to have to be prepared to grind. I don't mind this but it may turn some people away.I came into the game expecting some online pool and got it. As a bonus I'll be able to earn extra modes, it's not my daily goal so I'm not bothered by the amount you win. You DO unlock extra betting tiers by leveling (or so the game says, lvl 5 and you can bet 100 dollars to win 200)I got exactly what I paid for and look forward to the eventual bonuses. People looking for a full free game might not enjoy the limits. The lite version is a DEMO that allows you to unlock the rest of the game.Multiplayer online demo mind you. I reccomend this for anyone looking for a very casual free online pool game.EDIT: There are also daily / 24 hour cooldown bonus challenges to give you a boost in earning. These can be done with aim assist.			"

												If you like Pool, you'll love this game.  The controls are excellent.  They're responsive and intuitive, yet they still require some precision to pull off the perfect shot.  Let me put it to you this way, I haven't yet been able to blame the controls for missing a ball.  The graphics on the table are great.  I do raytracing as a hobby, and I still think the balls look raytraced.The menus navigation is a little unorthodox, but once you figure it out, it's quite easy.  The music is a little generic, but even if this were a paid game (practice mode, at least, is free), I can't say I'm disappointed one bit.			"

												This game so far has been enjoyable. Would be worth getting the full version if I keep on playing. The Unreal Engine certainly makes this game seem pretty hyperrealistic. And that's a major plus in my book. The gravity physics for the ball movement is pretty spot on so it really adds to the realism. Really competitive for your friends to play against you. So I give this game a thumbs up!My only suggestion would be is if you guys could add real-time games going on around the player's current game. I know that's what spectate is for but it would just be something cool to see and make the environment feel more lively and realistic. Its more so wishful thinking than a suggestion but who knows. Anyways, great game!			"

												This isn't about the game in total, it's more so about the lack of communication regarding how the devs promise constant feedback but all we get is excusesI haven't played the previous incarnation of the game so am fresh to this game without biasWell unfortunately it does not look good for devs who really don't care that much for their user baseI have gotten my money from the game, so that's not an issue, it's more so that devs really just do not careEarly Access is a joke, excuses never ending regarding communicationNot a problem, let use judge you on this, like others did on your previous effortsI was warned about the previous game, but since I had never played it nor encountered any other threads, I based my findings on recent activityStarted off great, then went all down hill Live and learn I guess...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now I have changed my review to refelct my previous thoughtsSince they Devs have actually been listening to teh community, I can only praise and change my previous review whcih was deleted and re-written14 patches in 6 months is pretty good imo, so I can only praise this game and now recomend itThis just shows that the devs are actually doing what they can to make sure this game is 100% playable, thx:D			"

												I originally tried playing prior to the patch which allowed friends to be invited didn't quite enjoy not playing with my friends, thankfully I gave it another shot. Whilst this game has a way to go to be great it's not bad for some nice casual fun. The fact remains it is still very much a console port and it does show but maybe with time it'll shine. Cons:- In my opinion there are too little options in remapping for changing keys and other ue4 tweaks would be nice (I manually added an fps limit to prevent crashes).Trying to gain money in the free mode is a grind I could do without especially as the mode without the aim assist costs so much.I firmly believe that the aim modes should either not be so pricey or to be free entirely to open the game up to the people who like a challenge. (though paying for dlc unlocks these)I felt bad for a guy in a green top on one of the scenes as he clearly had no friends and was talking to an empty chair (please get him a friend)Pros:-The gameplay itself is pretty damn solid It very accurately portrays how I can try to be clever and it goes horribly wrong with the cue ball ending up on another table,The scenes are also a nice addition I often get distracted by the tvs like at a real pool hall (maybe the woman laughs a bit too much though)A nice variety of game modes and a trickshot mode (although gated behind dlc, If you wish to expand your experience probably worth investing) "

												This is basically just Pool Nation with better graphics and little more content. The ""free"" version has nothing to it though as you need to earn cash to do pretty much anything. Being someone who loved the first Pool Nation, this is a great game, but if you're looking to ACTUALLY have this game, you should buy it. The ""free"" part of it is as if you were given a game's case for free, but you had to pay to get the actual disc. All in all, this is a great game, IF you really like pool games enough. If you're not crazy intp pool and you want the same experience for cheaper, get the first Pool Nation.			"

												Free to Download, Pay to Play. Access All Areas Online + Offline Paywalls = $11.99.This is Steam not the iPhone App Store... You should've just made the game $11.99 and the Lite version. The Demo. Besides that I did play this game first on Xbox One but the hardware limitations of a console. Made it a bit clunky. This PC version fixes that. It's very polished and smooth gameplay. They added people in the background Too. Which makes me realize. That I'm a life less pool stick... So that got me thinking. It would be cool if you could walk around these areas with players. while others play pool. Also make bets. So yes this is a good game and I think you should try out the demo. There's Daily Bonus Match, Daily Trickshot Challenge and a 8 Ball Pool practice mode. That you can play online with your friends! Such a nifty demo!			"

												Pool Nation FX is a game I first played on Xbox One. I Played it quite a bit there. Having just discovered Pool Nation FX is here on Steam,  I have to say I was surprised.  After trying the Steam version for a little while I can say that overall the games are pretty identical. there are a few changes here and there but nothing that really jumped out at me. The game itself is one of the only free pool games I have had fun with in recent memory. Visually the game looks really nice, and gameplay wise it is easy to learn. The only thing I can complain about at all really is that I feel the billiard ball physics are a little janky sometimes. your shots can often go in strange directions or more commonly just be way more powerful or weaker than intended. I feel like the game does a poor job at that. Still, I would recommend Pool Nation FX to anyone looking for a free pool game to try.			"

												So the graphics are absolutely GORGEOUS. The physics are good but not perfect. Seems like it could be a solid game, but it's 'free to play', which means you have to pay money if you want to unlock or do anything besides training mode. I haven't even looked into how much because I'm against 'free to play' games. If I want to buy a game, I want to buy the entire game in one go.Also, I can't figure out how to turn off the 'guide' that shows you exactly what angle the ball will go when you hit it. I don't want to play with a guide line, I want to play it like real pool.			"

												It's a decent game, the grinding for points is balanced i think. It takes time to open things up, but not a long ♥♥♥ time. However i can't recommend it, as i have come accross too many hackers. I guess the anti cheat system is non existant. I have ShadowPlay running and often record people cheating. It's pathetic but such is life. It's simply IMPOSSIBLE to aim a jump shot in under 2 seconds with perfect percision, make it, and then move onto another jump shot like nothing happened. At least if you are going to cheat, don't make it so damn obvious.			"

												Sometime i just need something relaxing to play and this is a nice game for it, if you like pool XD At first i was just getting my ... kick but after learning a little how to play i really enjoy it !With the free version you can:• Join or set up a 8 Balls table with default settings• Unlock DLC with the ingame credits you get (can take long time)• Your friends who have unlocked content can invite you to play with them• Play the Daily Bonus* for a limited time free players can join any game modeI suggest you to not get distracted by the bad reviews. Most of them come from free to play players who are frustrated to see the game is not completely free.What i don't like:• There is NO on table Tutorial like in the previous version.Skill center is nice to ""remind"" things but it's not really a ""how to play"". You can't even try anything in this mode. Practice Center is fun to try stuff and play in solo but you will learn so much more if just play the tutorial from the previous one. I do not recommend you to buy the OLD version unless on sale because it's hard to find anyone playing it "

												Sometime i just need something relaxing to play and this is a nice game for it, if you like pool XD At first i was just getting my ... kick but after learning a little how to play i really enjoy it !With the free version you can:• Join or set up a 8 Balls table with default settings• Unlock DLC with the ingame credits you get (can take long time)• Your friends who have unlocked content can invite you to play with them• Play the Daily Bonus* for a limited time free players can join any game modeI suggest you to not get distracted by the bad reviews. Most of them come from free to play players who are frustrated to see the game is not completely free.What i don't like:• There is NO on table Tutorial like in the previous version.Skill center is nice to ""remind"" things but it's not really a ""how to play"". You can't even try anything in this mode. Practice Center is fun to try stuff and play in solo but you will learn so much more if just play the tutorial from the previous one. I do not recommend you to buy the OLD version unless on sale because it's hard to find anyone playing it "

Early Access Review
								Uses the same game engine as pool nation. So the play is fluid , Once you get used to the speed. The draw strength seems very low, and needs boosting a bit to make it to feel better.This may be because of the leveling system with in the game. I have not played enough to use the higher cues. So maybe with experience points you get better realism. If this turns out to be the case, then this is a bit sad. In real life better cues do not hit harder, or change the way the balls hit each other. More expensive cues have better tips for more control. This should be what you get when you purchase a better cue in game.Lack of keybindings is a huge miss. I cannot adjust the butt angle because of my mouse driver not being recognised as middle mouse button. Yes I can change the mouse binding, but tbh, I will wait for a fix and play something else for now. Having played pool nation extensively, I know what to expect enough to not have to put the effort into it.Biggest negative I can see though is the view distance. Or rather big lack of it. The view distance needs to be increased massively. Having to use overhead view on distance shots just kills the realism in the game. Ideally set up a point of view key so you can offset what you are looking at, Just like you do in real life.Graphics support could use some tweaking. I was unable to set my native resolution 2560 X 1600. I ended up having to play in full screen, non windowed mode with 4k resolution. Which is not bad since pool games are not gpu intensive. I would rather play in my native resolution in windowed mode so I can view my second screen inbetween shots.Overall for an early access game,  a good experience. The fixes are minor programming wise, with the exception of a better viewing angle. The only real bugs I saw was the graphics detail set up.Looking foward to the full game in a more refined form.

												I feel like the game currently catching some flak in reviews is warranted, but it is better than a lot of ""mixed"" or worse games I have played- it just takes a while to see that and get invested into the game (the F2P seems more restrictive at first glance than it is, for example). I'm re-writing this review to accurately represent the latest changes.To head this off with the negatives, the console-y menu means that despite being a UE4 title, you have fairly little control over settings without heading to .ini files, the game crashes my video-drivers (crimson) a whole bunch at random intervals, and I had to use my driver software to limit FPS since there is no option for it in-game beyond V-Sync (and I'm on 120Hz). I wasn't a fan of the controls, they're a bit glitchy sometimes and took me a lot of getting used to, but they're definitely functional. The power of the overhead cam is not to be underestimated.The different stages are gorgeous and, for a feature I somewhat dismissed before playing, quite refreshing. Lobbies work  very well and I have not experienced any networking related issues at all, no lag or anything. The content you receive access to as a free player has been increased twice based on user-feedback in the two days since launch, if the devs continue to be this devoted to improving the game, this game will be back at ""very positive"" in no time, I'm sure. It feels like it was released from EA too soon, but I for one am positive about the future development.The core-gameplay had me raging and laughing with a friend for way more hours than 10€ normally buy me, so I'm pretty happy with my purchase!

												I wanted to play some good pool but this is not the case.This game has absolutely no physics implemented. If people think this is physics they have no idea how real pool / snooker reacts in ball collision. Positioning cue on cue ball for back / forward spin makes really strange trajectory for cue ball after collision. I play snooker in real life and NEVER seen anything like this. People who know real pool will really stay away from this game.Only good Pool / Snooker was Carom 3D in the past.CONS- Camera ""Free move"" should mean FREE move.- No chance to switch to OVERVIEW in opponent turn - no cue ball following in opponent turnand many more I could name.PROS Happy you made FREE to Play version to check and not to pay full price.

												Well, Pool Nation FX has really good physics and looks quite pretty, but that's all. Menu looks like made for Xbox or PlayStation, sounds too. Only a few (3 or 4) soundtracks. It's hard to find an opponent. Steering is really hard. Continuous opponent's voice transmission. And if you don't buy DLC for more game modes (9-ball or snooker, no cue lines), you should win 4 games. After that, you will uninstall that game and write a review like that.In the future, the game might be one of the best free-to-play pool games, but now it's just another game you play one or two times before uninstalling.

I mean, updates are frequent, and that means someone takes care about this product. In the end, once in a while, you will be playing against higher ranked player, and then to defeat him - is a nice reward.Girls and ladies, gents and gentsinhos :), the game is free. So why are you still reading this review?

												Is it Virtual Pool 4? Not quite. But I don't think it's trying to be. Pool Nation FX finds a happy medium between simulator and casual game. Graphics-wise, it's wonderful. Physics-wise, well, I haven't encountered  any weird behavoir. Someone mentioned it in an early access review, but the table speed seems a little off. I think it needs to be a touch faster. Shooting takes a while to get used to. I use no aim aids. I am not casual when it comes to digital pool. But I have been able to run racks against the AI with relative ease. English is about right, but, once again, it's not VP4. Bottom line, the cue ball, for the most part, does what I want and predict it to do.What I don't like is the generous pocket width...but that's personal preference I suppose. I grant this game a tentative thumbs up for those who like a casual to moderate pool simulation. For those who don't mind sacrificing great graphics for more accurate table models and physics, (and don't mind shelling out 30 dollars), then VP4 still reigns supreme. Pool Nation FX is a great effort by Cherry Pop. When compared to the abysmal Pure Pool, it's a no-brainer.			"

												I like how shiny the balls and cue are. Next gen pool gaming is here.F2P ReviewThe F2P version has an online mode, a daily challenge, and a daily trick shot challenge. The career mode and a couple other game modes are left out in the free version. Essentially what you are getting in the f2p mode is online play. When you win a match you get money. With the money you can buy cosemtic items like new balls, pool cues, etc. The game itself is pretty well made. The physics work the way you expect it to and there's a ton of advanced techniques you can do. The visuals of the game are amazing outside of the human models that look very plain. As for the funess. This game is only fun if you enjoy pool. There's just nothing in the game that makes it appeal to people outside of the target audience. So if you like pool this is a great game for you. If you don't like pool check it out if you want, but it's exactly what you'd expect it to be.			"

								Having played the first Pool Nation for many hours on both Steam and the Playstation 3, I was really excited to see Pool Nation FX was coming out.  Now that I have it, and have played it for a few hours, I highly recommend this game.  It's a beautiful game (no surprise there).  I love that they added people in the background milling around the venue while you play.  I had to chuckle that there is a TV going on in the background and they are showing Pool Nation on it.  The control scheme is smooth.  I also love the new tournament aspect.  In the original game, you had a string of players that you played through to make the title match of a tourney.  In FX, it's done in the fashion of a tournament tree, so you can see how the other players made it to that point.  I like that feel.  There isn't much else to say, really.  It's a pool game.  If you like pool games, then Pool Nation is one of the best that I have played.  They do it better than about anyone.  FX doesn't disappoint.  The price point is very reasonable, too.  I can see that I'm going to sink a lot of my future free time into this one.			"

It does need work...Pros- has uk 8 ball- has rules you can adjust to match what your used to- physics are good (however for some reason there's often a ball against the top cush near the top right pocket)- good customisation on line hintsCons / Needs attention / To fix / To add- mouse goes from slugish to super sonic, feels slugish and then into a huge acceleration curve which needs to be toned down- camera view after every shot is poor, switches to a bad angle of table instead of panning from where you took your shot to a good over view of the table to see the layout (should be option to go indy car racing cam or not)- music I keep getting notifications that the track changed to xxxx track name even though it's off- custom music playback folder selection needs to be implemented as the music that comes with the game is about as good as the best of elevator porn- background talking sound - the loop is very small and very annoying after a while, luckily you can turn this off (listen for the woman laugh and the bloke saying ""go on there"" over and over and over. At one point I think I could make out a swear word? For the love of god get some samples with variance- very very annoying computer slow take shots with what appears to be a 2 programmed routine set, 1st will be move to position and take shot (which is ok) but then the next one it's guaranteed to move 3 times till it starts to move que to put spin on etc and take shot (put some random numbers in the blue print! and remove that 3 step thing)- when adjusting cue tilt you can quite easily end up with the camrea view in a very bad position to see what your doing- needs speed options in menu to allow you to set how fast the computer takes their shot (thank god for right click to skip computer wasting your time)- needs additional right click skip watching computer shot to be 2 step, 1st click skip watching the computer setting up the shot straight to taking the shot, 2nd click will skip to next shot- pressing o for overview of table while computer is playing only serves to raise the camera temporarily- menu needs size reduction- ui needs work would be good to have smaller permanent ui for what pops up from time to time- settings menu was hard to find, logical structure is good on the menus for the most part but not all- pool location where screen has fire in it and behind a wall? if you have used one of the unreal engine 4's fire partical effects from the free demos. Heat visual distortion effect comes out of the projection screen / tv / through the wall (needs removing). Also sometimes bugs and fire can be seen outside the confines of the screen/tv/wall sometimes			"

Early Access Review
								If you love pool or have played Pool Nation or any other pool, then this is the game to get. Get it now and see what virtual pool should be like. The graphics and gameplay are beautiful and second to none. The control is great and smooth. Get it now while it's cheaper, before the release, which should be soon. This is a must have if you like to play pool!!			"

												Sorry for my late review,I bough the offline DLC but tbh not realy interested to play AI offline anymore although you can win more cash.1.Pros: -Super Realistic Looking Games        -Alot of Table Wallpaper,Balls color etc.        -Variety Of Pool 9ball,8ball,Sooker & Manymore2.Cons: -In Random Situation AI seems like more Skillful than you,They can be crazy to follow your steps for              foul lol.        -Stroking ball is hard to control,you need hold mouse 1 button and drag it back to lock the soft and                                                               hard shot meter                         -sometimes in multiplay you always forgot to lock the meter,i hate it when you always not enough          power to pot the nominated balls into pocket.

												If you love pool which i do, this game is for you. The graphics are amazing, it almost appears real life. There is a lot of unique controls for spinning the ball and making the ball jump. For me going in and playing it, i thought it would have been just a simple 2d, aim and hit pool game. For me all the controls were to much and i didn't expect it. Im sure over time the controls would seem fine, you would definetly get used to them. I might play it again, but at the moment busy playing other games, don't have enough time or effort to really delve in and master all the controls.			"

Rating: 7.9/10Paid: NZ$0.00 (Free-To-Play)Review:Pool Nation FX is a pool/snooker game where you play pool/snooker. With graphics and sounds effects that make you feel like you're in the room playing it. There's even a sound for when you hit the ball off the table.My favourite thing about this game is the atmosphere, the rooms are decorated amazingly, and I've never said this before, but I'm very surprised this was free. You can see the snooker table from the pool table, and the pool table from the snooker table.Did you know you could play with friends too? Yeah, if you're getting bored playing by yourself, invite a friend to play! Your friend doesn't even have to be on Steam, because you can play split screen as well.This game also rewards achievements, trading cards and has full controller support.The only thing that annoys me is that it takes a while to load and refuses to let me record with FRAPS. (Yes, I still use FRAPS stop judging me).Apart from the long-ish loading screen and the inability to record, I think when I retire work, I'm going to play this all day.			"

												[update] I should amend my review in light of the recent update, as my main complaint has been resolved. A large portion of the background animations have been removed, which has greatly improved the game. The balls now move with great fluidity, without the need of reducing the quality of graphics to the point the balls started to look square. This has had a consequential effect on the AI, which no longer performs a rather obscure lining up ritual: aiming for the ball to be hit, veering wildly in another direction, wait for about 60-90 seconds, whereupon it would then realign with the original ball.I am disappointed though that all the cues, ball sets and decals have been unlocked, as it was fun trying to win the money to unlock them. Now there seems little point in winning money; unless there is some gambling possibility in multiplayer; I don't know because previously the game lagged so badly, I feared my latency would get my @ss kicked from Hawaii to Japan because of the embarrassing length of time it would take to make my shot.Thank you Cherry Pop 8)If the devs would only optimise this game so it didn't run like a sloth on mogadon, then it might be okay, but as it is, the completely pointless animations and graphics going on behind the table really slow the game down on higher settings; and even on lower settings there's no real fluidity to the ball physics.I really don't know why they put all that rubbish in. Pool Nation ran like a sloth on PCP, and was a dream to play. But this, as it stand, is really a poor successor.			"

								A console port through and through. This is still in early access so I'd wait until the full release if I were you, but if you're hurting for a pool game then get the original ""pool nation"" instead. Much more bearable and graphically sharper than compared to the blurred edges of pool nation FX of which you can't seem to turn off no matter what setting you change.			"

After setting 15 minutes I could not make the first blow, but in real life I am a professional player in the pool, I took 1st place prize in the large world championship in Butovo. This game is realy, realy bad. Cant recommend it to anybody. Also u have the cut version if u dont wanna pay, and i cant understand, what can move me to pay. Good bye/			"

No, its a nightmare, since winning is the only objective, 80% of the people I've played refuse to shoot a clean break and to me this makes the game nearly unplayable and worthless.

								This is by far the best pool/snooker game I have played. The physics appear to be correct and the computer AI is also pretty good. The realism of the table is remarkable, it looks like you could reach out and touch the cloth. There are 9 game types in total including snooker which is a real challenge; it's a full size snooker table with tight pockets! The game is as you probabaly know is work in progress, however I only had one crash in many hours of playing. The price is also very cheap for a game nowadays so it's not a big risk to buy if you decide you don't like it.			"

I like that its a journey you have to follow, but  think i'll grab the online pack in sale! I do def recommend this game, if you like casual online fun, smash a few balls around.			"

												I installed this game wanting to play 1v1 vs a friend... yeah that's not going to happen. The free version is VERY limited. It's basically just a demo where you can't do much but sample what the full game would be like. Theres a curency system in the game that lets you make a little money (around $2000 per day?) but honestly I'm not going to play for 5 days to unlock something when my initial experience is what it was.As for the game itself, if you like playing pool video games this one looks really great. It shows where the path of the ball as well as the path of the ball that you hit... but this feature also some limitations:1) It doesn't show the distance of the two very well.2) If you bank the ball off the rail, it doesn't show the path for the ball you hit.3) If the ball you hit hits another ball, that path isnt shown (so a break shot, which should have tons of paths, doesn't show much)4) Making the ball move the way that you plan is nearly impossible since you have to hit it very precisely. Adding spin (side to side) and english (forward and backwords) is almost useless. If you know how it works you don't need it and if you don't you wont be able to pull it off every time.Overall, the auto-aiming-path-thing tells you what you should already know and it doesn't help you learn how to do trickier shots. I've played it for about an hour and I'm probably going to uninstall it.			"

												I've had a lot of fun with this game and have tried and also enjoyed Virtual Pool 4 Despite VP4 offering more game modes and an extremely helpful video & tutorial sectionFX wins out on top because of gamepad support, free multiplayer, table and ball decals and price point.If you're searching for a pool game your best options are FX or VP4: I would wait for VP4 to go on massive saleor release it's petty online subscription fees.As for FX you only need the $15 DLC; the other DLC just unlocks all of the game's decals early which spoils the game IMO.Both DLCs cost me only $2 during a BundleStars sale but after putting a lot of time into this game I would've paid $20 for just the necessary one.

												I think its a great game, but as many says, the controls are pretty stupid, it should get fixed. And what makes it more stupid, you have to buy DLCs to play a bit more than online game, its stupid and the DLC hugely overpriced in my opinion. Sell the game as a whole pack and lower the prices or as it now and lower the prices, this and the  patch to fix the stupid way it controls, then more would play it, and why shouldent they, in all if you look at possitive and let the negatives stay behind you, its a super game, and feel a bit like real billard.

								Pool Nation FX is a very polished and enjoyable game.  Hyper-realistic scenes and tables bring it to life utilizing the Unreal Engine 4.  There are many stages, times (day, mid, nite) cues, tables, and balls to choose. Playing in overhead mode brings back memories of playing old shockwave/flash based games.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good game of pool. There is also a sandbox mode where you can mess around with ramps, loops, fire rings, etc.  The only problem I have with this game is the absence of button mapping.  I would like to allow key assignment to my mouse and other macro buttons.			"

								It has been years I've been looking for a pool game that incorporates snooker that looks good with controls that feel natural.It has the bonus of having a career mode too.  Plus 8-ball and 9-ball, etc.  The graphics in the game is really impressive as well.I haven't played much yet, but certainly will.9.5/10 imoEDIT - I've played around 5 hours now, and I'm still really impressed.  I have been practicing on novice for now, but getting ready to play without the guides (I prefer to have no aid whatsoever... I just need the practice, lol).  Online is still a problem, as it can't find other people to play, but soon they're adding the Pool Hall, which will make it loads easier.  I only post reviews for games that I truely like, or impress me.  This is definately one of them.  But again, the fact that it has 8, 9 and especially snooker was such a big push for me to buy it, and I don't regret it one bit.			"

								Started up the game for the first time and I had happened to leave my Rift turned on instantly popping up the stereoscopic view on my monitor. I always turned the aiming aid off in the original Pool Nation and Native Rift Support is so huge to be able to look closer to the table and see depth in your shots. I had some graphical issues with it, but I haven't done much for configuration yet and my current graphics cards aren't the greatest plus I'm sure it will get better. The only thing that could make this better is motion controller support (something like glove controllers like ControlVR probably closer to ideal, though not out yet but two Hydra controllers can do). Loved the original and with the Rift this can be 100x better. Also the extra amount of customization offered in this game is certainly a plus, though the ability to call every shot (balls, pockets, combos, and rails) in 8 ball or other games would be great. If it is too hard to implement like that, a manual honor system with end turn and foul (scratch) buttons could allow anyone to call their shots and play their own rules. This game was already good and is getting even more realistic (even people sitting at a table and chatting in the background) which has even helped a little on a real table. Great job, keep it up!!

Early Access Review
								A major step up from its predecessor, even in Early Access form.  Pool Nation FX introduces a more robust and challenging set of aiming mechanics, vastly improved graphics, and online competition.  It also features the triumphant return of Snooker, my personal favourite way to play pool.  Snooker has largely been ignored since the glory days of Virtual Snooker on Windows 95, and I'm glad Cherry Pop decided to feature it in this next installment.  I'm also glad to see some NPCs hanging around the venues to make things feel more realistic, instead of feeling like I'm stuck in someone's incomplete virtual reality program.  Still, they should be interacting more with the player.  I wouldn't mind some tournament backdrops with an audience.  Pool Nation FX sticks to the down and dirty basics of pool, but it needs some dynamic atmosphere to really make it come alive.  The music is better than the original, though nothing spectacular.  Who else wants a custom soundtrack option to be able to play pool with their own playlist?  Are you listening, Cherry Pop?  In Early Access form, I feel that some things could be refined, most notably the mouse aiming.  It can feel a little sluggish when lining up a shot, and I wouldn't mind being able to scroll back a bit more for a better view.  Does it kill the gameplay for me?  Absolutely not.  But I think the original control scheme was far more swift.  There are a lot of modes to play, tournaments to enter, and online bouts to keep you entered for hours.  Pool Nation was a step in the right direction towards becoming the world's foremost billiards simulator.  I want to see Cherry Pop perfect the FX version even more than they have.  No resting on laurels!  This is too good a foundation to pass up.			"

Early Access Review
								Pool Nation FX fixes the gameplay issues I had with Pool Nations, and adds tons of content and customization. This is currently the most beautiful billards game ever, runs smooth and uses the Unreal Engine 4. I will definitely be playing this locally with my family and friends. If you enjoyed Pool Nation, but wanted more options and content, then FX is a no brainer to pickup.			"

												The game is fun enough but I am having a lot of trouble finding anyone online to play with. I never see ANYONE in the lobbies so it seems the purchase was for nothing.Disclaimer: I may be doing something wrong becuase steam stats shows ~288 people playing. Maybe all in single player? If the dev has any tips and tricks to fix it I'd happily change the review!Cant recommend due to no online players to play with :(EDIT: Issue is resolved! Able to play online now. Great response by the dev to fix the issue. Great to see. I have update my review. I'd say that if you enjoy pool this game is well worth the sale price. It is definitely a beautiful game and the physics/different difficulty levels should accomidate any level of player.			"

												Pool Nation FX Lite is pool table simulator game that is free to play.  You can use mouse/keyboard or controller.  Looks like you could learn to play real pool by playing this game.  Has various aiming modes.  It worked, looked good, played ok, sounds ok.  You have to play to level up. Cons: The tutorial screen pages are hard to understand. Has problems with losing players ragequiting multiplayer matches without punishment.Try it, maybe you would like it.For more info:

												Pc controls are ♥♥♥♥, forces to you to play with a controller basically. Feels like an Xbox One Port. The graphics are nice but if you're someone who doesn't want to use a Xbox controller or doesn't even own one for a matter of fact, this game really isn't for you. I can't tell you how many times I miss my shots because of the crappy mouse controls of pull back, lock in, push forward, causing the aim to turn a little. You're suppose to hold left click and push forward, but even that's busted.I own Pool nation, the original and loved it. PC controls were spot on, didn't make it feel like a console port. This game came off as a cash grab. Cash in on people who want a free pool game and who might stay, spending a few bucks here and there. The game is decent, but you have to pay for the good stuff.With the PC controls being lackluster and most of the good games behind a paywall. I have to vote no on the game. But if you use a controller and don't mind paywalls, check the game out. Or just buy the Original Pool Nation. Many people still play it online and it has a way better control scheme, or at least more responsive.			"

								Definitely an improvement over the previous one with Snooker actually getting a proper table and AI playstyle, experienced a few mid-game crashes however and atmosphere / career depth and consequences still need fleshing / filling out.Overall aside from the crashes its fully functional and featured like the previous but hollow in depth and gameplay carrots (pull) which well hopefully change as its updated in its early access status.

												The game has had an update and I can now see games with the DLC.  That being said, the game pulls off a pool simulation pretty well. I've read the negative reviews and most people have a problem with the controls. I do not have these problems very often. Once you learn how the keys are mapped, it becomes pretty easy to control ball movement across the table. As with any other game, proficiency comes with time played. Once you get used to how much power you need to pocket balls, the game actually becomes fun. Try it for yourself.			"

								After I saw the engine of PoolNation, I had high hopes for a good billard simulation.There was Snooker announced and loads of changes have been promised.Finally they added some trickshot obstacles and closed the chapter.With FX I gave them a new chance and got disappointed again.Well.... Snooker is added, but the cue handling for a shot is still console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Time to prepare a shot (for example jumpshot) in an online match is much too short, especially when you're new to the game - no chance.If you want to play a good billard game, get Virtual Pool 4 and forget this console/arcade game.

												The best looking Pool game hands down! The only gripe I have for this game is that there's very few updates, I would love to see more updates coming out for this game to make it even better. The user interface on here is very slick. Only thing that's out of place is the chatbox, which I hope they fix to make it more in line with the rest of the gorgeous UI. Also please add the ability for customizing the HUD. I would love to have a feature where you can completely disable it all together to make the experience a bit more immersive.Would be cool if we can mod this game, such as adding in our own music, new locations and venues, new pool table skins, etc...Please continue to make this the best pool game out there! Amazing graphics!			"

												Edit: ok, so now the Steam page states it clearly that this is ""Lite"" version. Replace the misleading logo on the top right and my first criticism will become obsolete.-----First of all, this game has serious communication issues. It keeps mentionign ""full game"", but what full game? Where is it? Steam page calls this thing ""Pool Nation FX"", but when you run it the screen says in plain English ""Pool Nation FX Lite"". The menus follow suit. Highly unusable and full of questionable decisions.On the second thought, forget it.. All you need to know is that the game offers no way to turn off the visual line pointing from your ball to the target ball. No way to make this thing disappear! Or I didn't find it (which is basically the same thing in my book). Maybe it's only in the practice mode, but what kind of practice it is then? It so happens, that I played a lot of pool in my life and I don't friggin remember seing floating white lines that help me aim. This reason allone for me nullifies all strong features that this game has or may have.Uninstall and forget it ever existed.			"

								Dont be fooled by the graphics. This game is half-a55 and frustrating. If you have ever played pool in real life just spare yourself the agony and buy a different game. 1) you scratch on break: re-rack and computer breaks. Computer scratches on break: you get ball behind the line (you can still shoot at any ball on the table tho). You scratch at all during the match and CPU gets ball in hand anywhere on the table. CPU scratch you get ball behind the line. 2) bottom english - straight shot; cue follows object ball into pocket (what in the illegitimate fxck?!). No matter what power your shot, if its a straight shot cue ball follows object ball. Its all messy.3) So limited on view options that it hurts. You can be right up on the cue ball or overhead view and everything else is a lie. When you are up on the cueball (view) the camera follows the stick when you change angles. You have an absolute shxt view of the table. 4) CPU takes FOREVER to shoot. It acts confused moving left and right and finally shoots no matter if its a difficult shot or the object ball is sitting right in the fkn pocket. You can skip watching the shot by right clicking but thats equally annoying because there is no indication that you have skipped the shot til suddenly all the shxt on the table is just reconfigured and CPU is taking next shot. You basically end up mashing right click constantly until its your turn. 5) Cant change the difficulty of the CPU in versus mode. Why? WTF Why?6) Good luck playing online. Either nobody is ever on there or its broken (maybe both).7) They call solids 'spots'. Hipsters? 8) On easy have watched the CPU run the table off the break uncountable times. Hard to believe if you ever watch the CPU shoot it seems confused about what its even doing. Put it on medium and the CPU cant make more than 2 shots in a row.9) You can only set it to call the pocket on the 8 ball? Seriously? How bout every shot? CPU will slop shot you and its extremely annoying.10) You will get aids and so will your PC			"

												FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT IS A LIE1> The game needs mouse + keyboard to perform vital functions so pretty much forget playing couch co-op2> I tried with 2 gamepads (Steam Controllers) and while they both worked in a rudimentary sense, they functioned as basically one unified controller.  Meaning that P2 can, at any time, control P1 and vice-versa.How these guys managed to take a great couch co-op game found in the ""original"" Pool Nation and butcher the gameplay experience this badly is shocking to me.---------------Edit 1: For those that have subscribed to this review for follow-up, here it is:  A patch has been released as of Jan 25, 2016 which attempts to fix the mess that is ""full controller support"" and 2-player local co-op.  It fixes neither and seems to introduce as many bugs as it strives to fix.  I still give a strong ""do not recommend"" rating.			"

												I don't get why this game get soo many negatives - It's fun to play, very well made graphics and the DLC's are very cheap. I'd rather choose the content myself then paying 20 USD for a game...Good game, loved playing it with friends - more a trickshot pool then simulator xD			"

												Bug filled game. Surprised? No.The devs suddenly got silent. Surprised? Not at all.They say they listen to our recommendations but they haven't fixed one issue yet after 8 months. The voice chat in-game is broken beyond belief. The game crash more often than not.  The cushions were much better in PN, now they feel like wood. I could name at least 25 other game breaking bugs but my time is more valuable than that. Cherry Pop doesn't care so I might as well stop right here because they don't read about their customers concerns and when they finally respond all they say is that they are hard at work on it but nothing ever get fixed. And that the bugs will get fixed ""SOON"". They must have repeat the word SOON at least 25 times since December 2015 and we are now August 2016 lol.The online mode stinks even more than a pile of zombies like in the movie The Walking Dead. The game was dead on arrival so we can't expect a miracle.Edited 17/11/2015The dev say that they have an ACE up their sleeves for populating the online portion. I wonder what it could be...How is that ACE going to help thousands of people being online? I don't get it...Let's say their ACE is for the people already having the game but who don't play it because it's boring, will that ACE be capable of remotely control their hand and have them click on the Pool FX icon so the game start? What is that ACE made off? Is this Black Magic?And for the people not owning the game, how is that ACE going to work? Will it send a transcendental message through their computer and have them click on the ""BUY"" button?Gemma (a dev) keep repeating the same old song over and over that once they launch the game officially, that the game will be populated with enough people to play online on a regular basis but I can't see how SHE will accomplish that.

The game itself is not that bad...it's the total lack of players online that make this game DEAD. The biggest defender of the game are the ones NOT even playing it on a regular basis and these are the same people who only have 3 to 10 hours played. They defend the game like if it was their own child yet they barely play.Cherry Pop just does not have the resources or talent to promote the game. Avoid this game at all cost.Updated; Seems like they just abandonned the game for their new baby Snooker Nation. Then in 4 months, SN will get the same fate. Abandonneware seem to be what this company delivers. Sure they won't say they are neglecting it but it will come quick enough because that's all they keep doing since 2013 ever since they launch PN.Also the MP lobbies are empty most of the time so their F2P dream hit them back straight in the face. Good for them and I'm just wishing they go out of business. Soon.***Updated August 17 2016***SNC was abandoned 1 months after release. GG Cherry Pop.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is so much fun!  So action pack.  Like 100X better. A must get!  There is no question what pool game is the best because this is it!  Plus Mac, and Linux support.  Would strongly recommend getting this game as an upgrade to Pool Nation, or enjoy pool in dollar general. The Gameplay, The Menu, The Online System, Graphics, The item unlocking system are Just WOW because they are so great!100% approval by me.			"

												Please Note -- This is for the FULL PAID FOR Pre-Release Version.I previously reviewed this game in a positive light. Now I have re-written the review in a negative light. Why? Because ALL the promises of fixing bugs and developing the ""snooker"" aspect of this game have all come to NOTHING.Cherry Pop Games are not honourable, decent people. The ""snooker"" community provided great feedback on how to make this game great and they took this and then released a ""new"" title called ""Snooker Nation Championship"" released as ""Early Access"" and promising to implement all the suggestions to improve the game while all along charging more money for a so-called ""new"" release which is basically a ""copy & paste"" job of the code from the first version.This game, as far as the snooker aspect is concerned, is unfinished and now looks like it will remain so as Cherry Pop Games have abandioned it. Check ouit the other comments on the forums here about ""Snooker Nation Championship"" and see for yourself.Do not give your money to Cherry Pop Games, the do not deserve it.			"

												The game crashes too much, the physics is mostly good, but some of the stuff really needs to be tweaked, like how if your hit the cue ball as hard as you can into a ball not far from it, the cue ball will magically bounce of the table back towards you, and during a jumpshot, which jumpshots in this game are also very tempermental, if the ball goes hit another ball, both balls magically fly off the table. It makes no sense and needs to be changed. Also for some reason, a couple times when playing 8 ball online, I will go through all of my balls and hit the 8 ball in and win, but occasionally it says I lost, when I obviously didn't becuase I didn't scratch and the 8 ball went in, but it left both of us wondering how that happened. It is mostly a good game, but there are little things here and there that make it really annoying to play some times. I would still recommend it, but would greatly appreciate seeing these things fixed.			"

												I love this game i really do, it's great BUT a few years ago (2-3 i dunno) i bought it for 10 euros, now it's free to play... and that's okay, i don't care, no problem.But NOTHING has changed during those years, that's NOT okay.Look at overwatch for example ....or ark, or slime rancher, or something. New maps, new heroes, new dinos, new slimes, and new ♥♥♥♥ in every month. But here i guess the devs had a few arguments or something, and they left this game as it was 2 or 3 years ago.			"

												Edit ReviewI used to recommened this title, but now seeing the devs just did a cash and grab on this title and Snooker nation title I can no longer support this game. Enjoy Pool Or Snooker? Try the Lite version This game has come on along way since its release and is now very enjoyable seems a good number people also playing online in the pool hall.			"

												Super beautiful game, taking me a bit to figure out eveything I need to know about it, but yeah, its a great addition to my Steam collection.  Low end machines will have issues with this title, but play around with the settings for the graphics and you should be good.			"
