												If you like Tennis and/or sports management games I think you will like this. No flashy graphics but the game is good fun, and the dev is very responsive to problems as well which is very nice.			"

												+ The best tennis coaching sim that I know of.+ It is updated once a year with new data.+ The developer is reactive and cares. Support him.~ Been hoping for an online mode for years but it's not planned.6/0 6/0 6/1  It's a work of love and has no worthy opponent			"

												When I first opened Tennis Elbow Manager, I was like, 'What is this stupid mobile game-looking crap?"".But then I played it, and kept playing it, and kept playing it. There is a lot more to this game than first meets the eye. I'm really enjoying it, and getting that, ""I'll play just a little bit longer"" disease that we're all aware of.The game seems to revolve around one character that you create, although you can sign contracts with other players too. You need to really think about how to develop your players properly. It's harder than it seems.The only knocks I have on this game are that it seems really hard to make money (which you need to hire better coaches). Only the major tournaments seem to pay anything. Also for some reason the game ends when your created character retires.I also think 19.99 is too much for this content, even though the game does play well. I'd wait for a sale.This is worth picking up if you like management sims. A great effort with excellent game balance from what appears to be one dev.			"

												Tennis is a sport that receives woefully little attention from game developers, and yet it is a wonderfully gripping sport. Not all of us want to play ridiculously Hollywood-esque ""first person simulations"" where graphics and endorsement by, say, the world's top ten players only are traditionally considered to be essential elements of the game mix. And here is a game that takes a very different view, illustrating brilliantly that there are STACKS of very good players, thousands of tournaments and that to get to the top it is a LONG HARD STRUGGLETo me it doesn't matter that the players did not endorse this, I think all the top 100 and more are based on real players anyway and it can be quite fun to work out who is who (pretty sure I saw Mark Venus in there, so the knowledge of the sport from the developer is top class)What makes this game so much fun is that it is unashamedly full of little details which can become crucial (for example if your player stops practising an element of his/her game he/she will actually get worse at it over time.I would be delighted if enough people invested in this so that one day perhaps there could be a version with the option of viewing matches in a slightly more hi-res format but it doesn't actually matter that much. If the players found out about the game and eventually endorsed it that would be fab too			"

												This is a great game, I've been playing it since 2009, The developer has made updates yearly since then for players, tournaments. I purchased the game again just so i could have it added to my steam library, money well spent for all the time i have played this game.			"

												Excellent game, played it countless hours before it arrived at Steam.Easy to get into it, so hard to master to become #1 in the world! Thanks god there are lots of ways to adapt the difficutly level. Prize is fine, especially now when its on sale. Dev. is perfectly listening to the community in a very appreciated style. If you like any kind of sports management games, you cant miss this one.			"
