Early Access Review
								Bringing you a no nonsense review from the guy Digital Lighting Studios filed a copyright strike on and tried to put out of business on youtube for bringing an ""honest"" review of what could be loosly even be called a demo. Had to call in Jim Sterling to set these guys right. Gameplay video review here:


YouTube™ Video: Soccer Legends-Putting the Early in Early Access 

			Views: 3,083		

			Taking a look at Soccer Legends, out on early access for steam. This is a game that enforces the stigma associated with Early Access. Not even demo worthy.		

Also note that SOEDESCO the publisher recently just popped out of nowhere with three other early access developers all in the same month with likewise only positive reviews and quashing negative stuff on the forums just to be warned. I will admit I am greatly intriqued with the concept and the trailer they show you but even in early access you would actually expect a somewhat working friendly mode. The developers did admit in an email they launched weeks ahead of schedule to cope with the Publishers demands to go live which is more then evil to say the least. The controls they layout for you, the camera angle changes don't even work and playing an actual match is bloody well impossible. You can throw out a zillion ""early access warnings"" but you ARE taking people's money well for something playable. If you'd like to raise money to make a game, well that's why there is kickstarter.I'd have more playtime but honestly you can't really even play this and it hurts the brain.The music is pretty spot on for the game though. In summary great idea for a game, but horrible handled and excuted thus far. Will be keeping an eye on this game and will definitely change the review once/if things get better.Looking forward to that.And remember squash this review and Jim Sterling shows up in your shower.

								Do not, i repeat, DO NOT purchase this game at all. Spend that money somewhere else on a working game even if the other game's graphics sucks bad. Do not get conned by the videos shown on youtube of this game working in perfect condition like how i got conned. Save yourselves from frustrations and time from writing email to steam asking for refunds. The word ALPHA stage used here clearly describes the developer's understanding of the word ALPHA is terrible. Alpha in all upcoming games provides a working gameplay, with lots of bugs for players to find out and report. Alpha in this game (Soccer Legends), doesn't allow their players to control what you are doing. Yes, you can't do anything in this game other than clicking the functions when you are not in a match. One a match begins, its gg for player, win for developers as they actually charge people money for this. And this controlling issue has been ongoing since their ""alpha"" launch in August if I'm not wrong. Its been 2 months now and still controlling issues aren't fixed yet. The devs really has got all their bug fixing priority messed up. There's no point adding extra game modes when players can't even play at all. All in all, everybody who purchased this game can only find the bug of being unable to control anything in game and nothing else.  Take my advice, go to the forums, read the bug reports before you want to take the risk of donating money to the devs. Even if the game goes live, please think twice and read up the forums before rushing in. Rating : 0/10 as I can't even play a proper match to call it an actual gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								NEW AND FAST EDIT: once again devs abandoned the game and stoped replying after having the money. Don't even try to buy since the game is pretty much not playable.I was really hyped but ...OLD EDIT: really good game if you have in mind that it is a alpha. Has a lot of potential and it's different, so i would recommend it.for now it has only the friendly option so PLEASE DEVELOPERS PUT THE CAREER MODE ON FAST, I WANNA PLAY MORE AND MOREEEEE :d +1 from me to this!

								Very early access, but the concept looks solid. Bit like a turn based Inazuma Eleven. If everything gets implemented, then should be marvellous in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								As it stands right now, it's in a really early phase of development and as such, I can only comment on its current version. To be honest, I'm not that much of a fan of soccer, but I definitely like the aspect of adding tactical turn-based RPG to the matter.I believe it's also the first of its kind on Steam to feature a full experience of managing a team, as well as controlling it in the process.  So if you're into soccer, I suggest giving this game a try! And even if you're not that into it, its gameplay might change your mind!			"

Early Access Review
								Here is a different game with a new smell. I am sure I will play this game, which is kinda a  middle path between a classic role gaming per turns and a dynamic football action. No mentioning It has a manager section which looks very good.If you like football and / or role playing games, I think this game could be reaaaally interesting and funny.   ^^ANXIOUS to see new updates  _:D----------------------------He aquí un juego diferente con un aire nuevo. Estoy seguro que jugaré este juego, que es algo como un termino medio entre un juego clasico de rol por turnos y un dinámico juego de acción. Sin mencionar que tiene una sección manager (direccíon de equipo) que pinta muy bien.Si te gustan los juegos de futbol y / o rpg, creo que este juego podría ser muuuuy interesante y divertido.    ^^ANSIOSO de ver nuevas actualizaciones    _:D			"

Early Access Review
								As far as I can tell the gameplay is kinda cool, a little slow at first. There is only the ""friendly"" option at the moment. There is no tutorial either. So it's essentially a figure it out on your own kinda thing. Keep in mind this is exactly what it says, EARLY ACCESS. So i cant give this a bad review, because this isnt even close to the full game.			"
