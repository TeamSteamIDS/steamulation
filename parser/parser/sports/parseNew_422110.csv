												Aesthetically this game is fantastic! It has it's own unique and compelling art style, easy to understand and fun gameplay and of course, a great music to tie it all together while you are swearing at your friend!Each time you complete a level or game with our friend, you gain exp and the ability to unlock characters, levels etc. Which will soon get you hooked!It's a great party game, I played it with only one other friend but I can imagine the chaos of trying to hold my own in a 4 player game (the good kind of chaos, of course!)I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you and your friends enjoy screaming at each other.

			Watch me play Wand Wars, a newly released fast paced arena game with wizards and magic! http://store.steampowered.com/app/422110		

The art style is great, the music is nice and up-beat, combine that with the awesome gameplay of you hitting a magical ball that gets faster and larger as it gets smacked back and forth by you & your enemy, until one of you gets hit and you're out!There's a handful of modes, levels, characters, powerups that you can pick up, and up to 4 players in one match be it bots or with your friends (locally. No online multiplayer sadly).Was keeping an eye on this game for a while but never got that excited for it until I've played it and played a lot of matches. It's really fun and planning to play more of it in short bursts.			"

												Wand Wars has easy to learn but hard to master gameplay, fantastic local multiplayer action, a challenging single player mode, and some of the best game feel I've ever experienced. Every button you press feels impactful and juicy, and timing is everything. Local multiplayer is where this game truly shines, but even if you don't have a group of friends to meet up and play games with, imo it's well worth the price to check out the story mode and play some bot matches. Even when you're playing with the AI things can get pretty intense. I've logged about 4 hours total so far (probably more than half of that in single player) and I feel like I still have a lot of improving to do before I'm good enough to take on the top level bots and the final stages of the story mode - but I get a little better every time I play! Make sure you play with a controller for the best experience, and make sure you play with the volume up, as the music and sound design is also top notch.			"

												Wand Wars is an frantic arena-brawling game for both single and multiplayer, where you have to catch and toss a killer orb at your opponents while trying not to get turned into a chicken.The orb mechanism is easy to grasp and you'll be an expert in no time. Press a button when the orb is close and you capture it for a short time, giving you just enough time to aim and fire it at the nearest opponent. Once fired, the orb just keeps going, bouncing off walls. As the match proceeds, the orb gets larger and faster.It's about timing, basically - hitting the button just before you get smashed in the face, then turning the tables on whoever threw it. With the full 4 players, it's pure twitch gaming.Wand Wars gameplay review video:

			Wand Wars gameplay review of this single & multiplayer arena battle of wizards, catching and tossing a killer orb at opponents!		

On its own, that would be a decent but limited game. But your second ability is to fire black arrows. If you hit an opponent, they briefly turn into a chicken, whose only ability is to run away. The arrow can also be used to neutralise the orb, making it slow and harmless until next caught. Together, these two things add an element of strategy to your attacks, although nothing complex or clever. The only way to really add strategy to the game is to play in teams, 2 vs 2. So perhaps one player would be on chicken duty, the other orb. Or you could pass the orb between you (you can only harm enemies when firing the orb), and only strike when the time is right.Powerups are sometimes added to the arena (and you can optionally start with some in Versus). They're massively powered deadly attacks of different kind, and can turn the game into chaos as everyone tries to fire them off at once. When you fire them, the game pauses for a couple of second for an animation, which can get tiring!The singleplayer Story Mode is split into the stories of six unlockable characters, each consisting of several matches. Each match has something unique about it - number of players, teams, weird levels with moving walls, different game types etc - so it never gets dull. Versus Mode consists of single, customisable 1-4 player matches (including however many bots), with a choice of 5 game types. This includes the basic battle type, a type where your team has to get the orb into the opponent's goal, and more.Pleasingly, Wand Wars works well in singleplayer. The bots are well programmed in the basics (with multiple difficulty levels), so it doesn't feel like you're not really playing the game properly. They're not so clever at guarding the goal in that game type, but that's a team-focused game and should really be saved for humans.Wand Wars feels slick, it's easy to learn and not difficult to master. Pulling off a good move is very satisfying - stuff like turning an opponent into a chicken just as you're about to grab the orb, then bouncing it off the wall into their stupid clucking face. The limited strategic potential means this game will have an exciting but fairly brief life in your library, but if you have a good local multiplayer scene going, it'll fit happily into the rotation. And if you play it singleplayer, the Story Mode keeps changing things up enough for you to want to keep going.* Version reviewed: 13 April 2016 build* More indie gaming videos by Randomise User "

												A charming game with really great local multiplayer!It's a mix between Towerfall and Lethal League, but different enough to be something new.- Simple gameplay, but with a good amount of depth to it- Multiple game modes- Great art and sound- Power-ups and character unlocksI highly recommend this game if you want to play locally with friends. It does have a singleplayer campaign if you want to play alone (haven't played it yet), but I think that the real worth is in bringing some friends over and having a great time. If that's what you wanna do, this game is for you.			"

												This is how I see wand wars. I've played quake for quite a few years now and it's a hard game. Wand wars gives you that same feeling. It can be casual and fun with your friends but, also very intense and skillful. If you love to game vs your buddies face to face and compete or just have a great time. Wand wars is an easy 10/10. I play a handful of games and I think this game rocks.I playQuake Live, Starcraft 2, Reflex, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, and recently Overwatch. Wand Wars is this calibur with quality game play. Plus the soundtrak is awesome. I just crank it on the house stereo haha.			"

												When I was first looking at this game, I thought it was a re-skin of Lethal League. Then I remembered how much I loved Lethal League for the fun, fast paced little gem it was and said ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and bought this game for 12 bucks. Instantly, I fell in love and realized that this game brings more complexity and flair to that Lethal League niche. The game is fast and blood pumping, the controls are responsive to match, the soundtrack slaps, and the character sprites are amazing. Granted, this game ramps up the difficulty pretty high at times, almost to the point where you'll want to put your fist through your computer screen, but its also super rewarding when you reach a personal goal or checkmark in the story. Of course, this game could benefit from online play, but the ""Endless Tirals"" mode gives a LOT of life and replayability to this game. Support the Devs. Pray for online. Give this game a shot. It's probably one of the best ways you can spend 12 doll-hairs on the internet.			"

												Copy provided by developer for promotion consideration at http://isthereanydeal.comI have to say I fell in love with this one pretty fast and the similarity to Lethal League really helped. If you have some local friends go grab Wand Wars right now and have some really good time turning each other to chickens, smashing them with bouncy and speed-and-size-increasing orb of light and using special spells to turn the tables. You can even change some game rules.Though, if you're buying this for the campaign only, it's good, a bit short and it's basically a story-based tutorial introducing you to the game modes and spells and building this ""I can't wait to play this with friends"" feeling insde :)And it's actually pretty challenging on hard mode. Saying that if only intend to play alone I would wait for a sale.I am hoping this game gets the deserved attention and fanbase and some post-release support (some leaderboards, score based modes, etc.). And who knows, maybe we get an online multiplayer down the road?			"

												A game with a concept simple as Ping Pong (as my brother called it when he saw it) with a brilliant and very addictive execution! This game has a colourful world with quirky and fun characters and original artstyle, very competitive AI and a very challenging story mode to keep the lone player busy and satisfied. There are challenging and very fun local multiplayer modes to try and play, magics to dominate and characters to unlock. An Easy to Play but Hard to Master kind of game players will not regret purchasing!The multiplayer aspect of this game is at the time of writing still local-based, the developers (a team of three people with only one being programmer) have stated that they may work online-multiplayer, but it might take a lot of effort to do so. However it has NOT been ruled out.			"

												BUY👏THIS👏GAME👏NOW👏FEMALE DOG👏Ok, but in all seriousness, Wand Wars, despite its corny name, is one of the best games I have ever purchased on Steam. It is the most fast paced, fun, heart racing, colourful, and unique game I have encountered so far. There is no way I'll ever be able to do this game justice with just one simple review, but I'll try anyway! (Warning: I wrote this review in the span of like 10 minutes, so forgive me if this is a little short. Also, English isn't my first language so feel free to point out any mistakes I made!)The Good: The SpritesThe pixel art in this game has to be one of the best I've ever seen, the art style really helps it stand out among other pixel art retro games with their, unfortunately, samey designs. Everything on screen is colourful and clear, it is obvious that a lot of love and attention to detail went into this game. I still find myself ogling at the wonderful art in between matches or games.  The MusicA fast paced game obviously needs some fast paced music, and honestly, the soundtrack, while on the short side, doesn't disappoint. It is extremely catchy, well-made, flows wonderfully, fits the feel of the game, and it is just amazing. I even got the soundtrack, which I never do with any game, and I still frequently listen to it. It is just the thing to make someone really hyped for what's coming. However, some people may not like the rather short soundtrack, but every song is varied enough to not make you feel as if you're listening to the same song over and over again. The GameplayI'll admit, at first glance, I thought this was just an over-glorified Pong game with wizards instead of whatever those white lines were supposed to be in Pong. I could not have been more wrong. While it does share some elements with Pong (and by some I mean just one), it still manages to stand on its own as a game. The power-ups, characters, challenges, game modes, all that good stuff really helps to keep this game fresh and adds a lot of replayability. I honestly see myself years in the future still starting up this game to beat someone's♥♥♥♥♥at Quittich Wand Wars. The game is also very faced paced but balanced. Anyone from the most casual to hard-core gamer can sit down together and have a fair 1v1 match. Or 1v1v1v1, or 3v1, or 2v2, and you get the idea. In short, there is a lot of poopy to do in this game, and I'm enjoying every second of it. No matter how many matches I play, I can never get bored of it. The ControlsWhile this may seem like a silly thing to comment on, you will not believe how many of these fast paced games I've played that have the most horrendous and awkward controls. Thankfully, Wand Wars doesn't fall into this trap. The controls in this game are very smooth, tight and responsive. Your fingers flow naturally over the keys and you're never let wondering what button does what. And it's even better when using a controller! To be honest with you, I would adore  it if I was able to change the controls. But that's more of a nitpick than actual criticism. If the Devs decide to let you tweak your controls, then yay for me! And if they don't, then eh, what can you do? The controls are still tight and responsive nonetheless.  The Local MultiplayerAll I have to say about this is, YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS. FINALLY, A GAME WITH PROPER LOCAL MULTIPLAYER. HAVE I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN? THIS. IS. SO. YES. Just yes, you have no idea how it fun it is to be able to sit on a couch and duke it out with friends. While yah, lobby making is a thing in a lot of games. Lobbies will NEVER match the amount of fun and the intimacy one experiences when you sit down with all your friends together and play rather than playing on separate consoles/PCs.Now, we all know no game is perfect, and Wand Wars has a few problems it does need to sort out. As much as it pains me to be critical about this game, I really want this to be a fair review.The Bad: The Obvious ProblemLet's address the elephant in the room. There is no online play. Yah, that's right, no online matchmaking, no online tournaments, none of that. All local multiplayer. WAIT DON'T LEAVE YET! Trust me, the Devs KNOW that people want online play, and the Devs want to implement it into their game! Trust me, I talked to them. They REALLY would love it if they were able to bring all of y'all online play, but they can't do it right now. For one reason or the other, the Devs currently cannot add that feature into their game, but you and I know, they really want to. And maybe they will! We are just going to have to be patient. And remember, Wand Wars is Moon Radish's first game, and they are an EXTREMELY small team. I would appreciate it if you didn't constantly pester them with questions all the time, feel free to respectable ask about something that concerns you, but remember these are very busy people. They just realised a HUGE update, and they are very hardworking, you will get your online play, don't worry. But just not now. The UnfairnessI get it, these fast paced games have to be difficult and to present a challenge if they don't want to get boring fast. However, at the time that I am typing this out, the game is very unfair. The campaign can get near impossible at times, and it really could use a little tweaking. With enemies that catch the spell almost a 100% of the time, pin-point accurate enemies, hordes of the enemy teams constantly volleying the ball to the point where it's impossible to catch it. The whole game suffers from this, but the newest game mode, The Trails, suffers the most from this huge problem.     Everything and everyone you constantly fight in The Trails are part of the same team, the opposing team constantly volleyed the ball to the point where it goes supernova without you touching it once, the AI is way too smart at countering and killing the enemy (Hell, some can predict where you're going to spawn after dying), the Knights always and only targeting the enemy. The whole thing is a cluster fook and soon it'll be impossible to see your own character as the screen fills up with the red sprites of the enemy team. Don't get me wrong, the game mode is extremely fun and creative, don't let my harsh words stop you from buying this game. I am being very hyperbolic here. But still, the game could use a bit of tweaking and maybe starting with The Trails first would be the best option.     Perhaps make some trails a free-for-all, or always have a very small chance of a friendly wizard spawning to help you, or have the Knights and other random spellcasters (whose names I forgot) pick no teams and go after everybody. When most people can't get past the 7th trail, it's time for some tweaking.A few closing words. if any of you really want to help the Devs to make their first game a success, then I recommend you go out and spread the word about this. DO IT. The Devs had an extremely unfair start, with their game realising at midnight, the ""Add to Cart"" button bugging out, and having their game pushed down the new realises list by 50 open-world, survival, zombie crafting games. The Devs had an extremely rocky start and deserve all the help they can get. Please, do not let this well-crafting game be doomed to be forgotten. The Devs put ALOT of heart, hard work, and effort into this beautifully crafted game. And besides, who wouldn't want to turn their friends into chickens?			"

Absolutley not.I would be happy with the pricetag if there was at *least* online multiplater instead of only local.  When this games gets as low as $4, I'd be happy to pick it up.

												This game is so simple and yet so addicting! The light humour is great, the artwork and animation is beautiful and I really love the soundtrack. The controls are slick and the game allows for some tight and reflex-intensive matches and I love all of it! 5/5!!!			"

												Imagine a fun version of Lethal League. Oh, you already like Lethal League? You'll double-like this. Give it a go, folks.			"

												Very fun take on the Lethal League formula. Spacing the characters out and making it top down makes the game much more friendly for 3/4 players. The pixel art is very pretty and the soundtrack is fantastic. Must have for any 4 player local enthusiasts.			"

												If you don't have 360 controllers the game won't detect anything. You go to the discussions page and you have the developer posting that it supports a bunch of controllers (clearly it doesn't, whatever unity pack they bought isn't doing the trick), and that a future update will add button remapping (never happened)So here i am, with a local multiplayer game that only detects my keyboard. I will update the review if anything changes but i'm not holding my breath. Waste of money and time trying to get it to work.			"

												It's ok it feels like a party game I don't know why but it does probaly because everytime I play a party game I start to punch myself in the face just like I do in this game, a lot. I started making a dent in my wall I think from the back of my skull.			"

												Wand Wars is a blast. It's excellent by every measure. The gameplay is novel and fun, the soundtrack is catchy as hell, and the art is beautiful. I would rank this as one of the top 3 couch co-op games on Steam, along with Duck Game and Overcooked. It evokes the glory days of 16-bit multiplayer party games on SNES and Genesis, but it's much smarter, faster, and more engaging than anything that existed back then.Highlights- Arcane Arena is probably the most intense single-screen deathmatch I've ever played. Unlockable maps and powerups offer plenty of variety and depth.- Merlinball combines quidditch with air hockey and ends up feeling a bit like NBA Jam! Unlike NBA Jam, you can turn your opponents into chickens before you dunk on them. And unlike quidditch, it actually makes some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense.- Endless Trials Co-op offers a high level of challenge and a really interesting take on progression. Great for preserving a friendship after destroying someone at Merlinball.- The AI in this game is surprisingly great, and 10 levels of difficulty means you can fine-tune the bots between matches. As a result, 2v1 is quite viable, because you can choose whether to treat the bot like a handicap.Negatives- No online multiplayer. Maybe next time?I was amazed to find this game hanging around on the dusty backshelves of the Steam store with so little fanfare. It's a hidden gem, and it deserves to be celebrated. You should pick it up if you have even 1 friend to play with locally.			"

												Beautiful and intense, Wand Wars is a joy to play! Booted it up for the first time to play with some friends, and we quickly picked up the general gist of the game. Within moments, we were hurling furious balls of light at each other, or dangerous bolts of chicken-induced magical fever. When my friends headed out, I played some Story mode and found a bite-sized but fun single-player experience that tested my skills.Aesthetically gorgeous! The pixel art is well done, and the music is outstanding -- definitely something I'll be listening to outside the game. The game has a great deal of polish.My only complaint is that the game tends to pick up other controllers that are powered on, and doesn't offer the most intuitive way of ""removing"" them from play. A minor nitpick, but one I felt was worth mentioning!			"
