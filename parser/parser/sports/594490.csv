Early Access Review
								Deadly Hunter VR was a big surprise for me, I admit. I never tested the demo but decided to jump on the full version as I was excited but without any big expectations. But during the first minutes of gameplay, I realised this VR game is something different compared to most VR-archery and defense action games. Hands down, Im impressed - and if you want to know why, please read below or check out my first gameplay video of Deadly Hunter VR in Mixed Reality view:

My thoughts and short review:Deadly Hunter VR was a blast from the start. First thing you see is how beautiful and polished the graphics are. Its crisply sharp, colorful and detailed. While jumping into the first level I was not even aware of what this game actually was about, so I started off and found myself in an intense action battle using a bow and arrows against evil Orcs and creatures. ""Wow, that immersion"" was the first thing that crossed my mind. The environment is really atmospheric, the in-game music and soundtracks adds to the presence and I can admit that it was quite a challenging gameplay from the first beginning. The gameplay:Well, firstly - no this was NOT a wave-based ""standing-still shooter"" that I was expecting it to be judging from the Steam trailer. You can actually freely teleport around in most battle sequences and levels, especially from level 3 where it all starts to get really fun and challenging. You use a bow with arrows (that you later on can upgrade) and the Vive controller mechanics just feels simple but great compared to many other similar games. The bow is easy to handle, aiming is spot on and you master the technique to shoot very fast in no-time.Besides the bow, you progressively get upgraded with different traps to set out. All have their own strengths and weakness. The traps can also be upgraded further on with various combinations. Great idea for a game like this.Main menu:Really good looking and informative main menu-area with a miniature-map of the area and all levels. You can check out all existing opponents, all unlocked skills and traps etc. The main menu also contains descriptions of all features, including books and cool animations, which are just priceless i think - love this in VR!The Graphics:Beautiful, just beautiful! Polished, detailed and various environments really adds a lot to this game, and the VR immersion really is present. Considering this is a Unity engine game, Im truly impressed about how good it looks. No graphical glitches as far as I could find, and the game feels not too demanding on the computer (more on that later).The Sounds/music:Atmospheric music in the backgrounds is very important in my opinion, and Deadly Hunter had just about the right music that adds a lot to the battles and the feeling. Sounds effects are good, well really nothing to complain about.Difficulty:There is no difficulty level adjustment as far as I know, but playing only the first 5 levels I think it was challenging enough. Already on level 3 I died once and it gets much more intense further on. I think this difficulty should fit most VR gamers, but I also hope the devs will add difficulty-option in some update soon. Price/value:Well, considering the price-tag this is a no-brainer! Approx 4 hours of gameplay, in more than 20 levels and loads of challenging and intense gameplay for around 18 Euro (not sure how much it is in USD) is worth it all the way! Finally a game that really gives you long enough gameplay-time for the money - thank you developers, we need more of that! Also, there is a free demo, so of course you can try-before-you-buy.Performance:I had no performance issues or dropped frames playing this on my GTX 1080 Ti - bare in mind I was actually recording 2 instances of OBS software-captures for mixed reality view, VR view and green screen capture at the same time. Doing this is really demanding on your GPU in most VR games, but in Deadly Hunter I had no problems whatsoever. Perfect 90fps all the way!Well, all in all, I really recommend this game to everyone - do doubt. I will probably update this review as soon as I have played more and when new content gets added. Really hope multiplayer will be available soon!Thumbs up!CheersSweViver			"

 Gameplay video Legolas is happy. Lots of traps, some kinds of arrows, escort missions where you can walk through all map, headshots, two types upgrades for each 5 traps. May be tire is too common genre, but this game is well done and worth it's price what cannot be said about most other VR games.			"

								A very cool fun VR game guys. Graphics are Awesome, Gameplay and Control are great. For the Price is a deal, So much content for an EA game. I am still got to do some traps upgrades and play more Levels. Definitly recommended for any VR gamer. Get ready to Kill Monsters and get a good cardio doing so, Lol			"
