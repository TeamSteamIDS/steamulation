												A person here said he have to wait 10 or more minutes before a fish bites, I can think that this person know less of fishing then mewhen i played the game i had a lot of fish, some got away but they were very heavy and my gear wasnt so strong enough yet to bring him in on time, wich is normalu can use different bait and hooks wich improve the catching

												I have recently found a new game 3d Arcade Fishing, so I have decided to give it a spin. The first thing I liked about the game is graphics. It looks really good, with animated water and swimming fish. I also liked the fact that not only I can choose my avatar, but I actually play with the person of my choice. As I didn't like too much menu music I really found the in-game sound soothing and relaxing - just like real fishing would do. There are some minor issues with animated fish underwater but I believe that developer will fix it soon - it is very fresh game after all. The game mechanics are fairy common - you throw, you wait and you pull - everything what is expected from a fishing game. There is a variety of places where you can fish along with a selection of rods and other fishing equipment. All in all I really like the game and wish that this one will improve and get polished in time.			"

												I Love fishing IRL and thought why not, since it's not very pricey, the trailer looked good and screenshots gave me good impressions. After two hours I must say: definitely a sweet purchase and worth the bucks.Very intuitive, easy to manage controls. For example you can catch fish by using one hand on the mouse and the other for chugging beers (just as IRL-fishing). I like that you can set graphics/resolution/window before the full startup, so you can always adjust to your right-now-gaming-needs. Also for this game the graphics DO look good. Of course everything is not as finely tuned as with ""COD:XYZ Generic Zombiewars Part 271"", but it's enough high quality to have fun and enjoy the view.If you love an easy to control fishing game and want to take stress out of your day, do yourself a favor and get it. And now I'll go back to fishing, since I haven't caught them all (yet). *opens beer*			"

												The way the water looks and moves is very relaxing. Even without the fishing part I could just sit and listen to music as I watch the water. As for the fishing, it was stated that this is not meant to be realistic. What they don't mention is how much fun this is. Without a USB force feedback fishing rod/reel combo, no fishing simulator is ""realistic"" so this suits me just fine. So far the pike seem to be the most challenge to bring to the shore. Like real life, You do not always have to cast far to get something big. It is easy to learn and a great way to have some good clean family fun. I recommend this to anyone who wants to go fishing but not bad enough to smell like it. I also recommend this to anyone who has lost a big one or who listened to stories of the big one that got away. Get this game and You can tell your own stories. I caught a pike 2 days ago bigger than my daughter...see...got a story already.			"

												Best fishing game on Steam to play with 1 hand. So if you like to drink a beer while gaming and you love fishing then this is the game for you. The graphics are overall good and it's very satisfying to catch a huge fish. My only downside is once you unlock all locations and fishing spots and get all achievements there's not much left to do. Hopefully there will be DLC sometime down the road.			"

												Found this game by coincidence. As I love to go fishing in real life I just gave it a try! I really enjoyed the game. The mechanic iseems to be simple, but you have to be careful, otherwise the fish will escape in the last second. You can play with different profiles, so theres already a competion who got the biggest fish in my family.Until now I just fished the Ruhr-Lake and got some nice Roaches, but I can't wait to unlock the other areas and go for even bigger fishes.All in all a nice game for everyone who loves fishing!

												So I just tried out a Pre-Release of 3D Arcade Fishing. While it now has been released on Steam, I will give you a Heads Up. The Game is Interesting at Best, can be Rather slow and no real 3D aspect to the game as you stand in one location while fishing. But have a look and try it for yourself if you are into FISHING as you may Enjoy it. As for myself I am kinda tore between liking and hating, playing more may make me change my mind. Enjoy!			"

												I love this fishing game, as I'm really a poor fisherman, don't laugh its true. After the first 10 mins or so you can get to grips with it and have some fun. I wouldn't pay dear for as it's only got 3 locations, I got my when steam had a weekend sale.But it's fun so try it out "

												I was looking forward to a cool fishing game and was extremely dissapointed. but for those interested I broke this game down for you...Pros: - You wait 10+ minutes for something to bite, just like real life! (never actually got anything to bite before uninstalling)-A cheesy stadium announcer voice yells ""THHHRRROOOWWW!!!!!"" every time you cast your line.Cons:- The fishing mechanics are horrible - fishing sfx sound like someone recorded them on their iphone.- animations are garbage (fish swim sideways, lure simply appears where you throw it, etc...)- there are probably 50 different kinds of fish swimming in a 20ft radius (humorous if anything)- music is terrible. (my farts sound better than the soundtrack)REQUESTING REFUND			"

												Ah man, I love fishing irl so I decided to give this a try, it's fun almost half of the time otherwise it gets really boring, it takes less time to catch a fish in real life than this game. It crashed on me multiple times, it's buggy, and the voice acting is terrible, it needs major fixes and graphical patches, till then, I have to give this a negative review, will change it if everything is improved and fixed.
