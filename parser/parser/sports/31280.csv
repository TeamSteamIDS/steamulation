												Poker Night at the Inventory is a Poker game made by Telltale Games. It is available for €4 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night at the Inventory allows you to play Texas Hold'em with Max, Strong Bad, Tycho and the Heavy.So what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. A Characters will sometimes use an item to play. If you beat that character, you will get that item in Team Fortress 2! While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!Verdict--------This game offers a lot of fun for just €4. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!This game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want all unlockable items you can be found at the Inventory for 50 hours.Score: 81/100			"

												A decent hold'em poker game, where you can win four items of Team Fortress 2 game (which is not of any interest for me) and listen a hilarious in-game chat of 4 fun characters: Max from Sam & Max series, Strong Bad from Homestar runner, Heavy from already named Tea Fortress and Tycho from Penny-Arcade(dotcom). All of them are lovable. It could be very relaxing, dealing cards, and listen idle, yet clever chat of those four. For some time, at least.Game have only one downside: once you heard all the lines characters were going to say... and win all 4 items from them... it is getting bleaker. Losing colours and taste. And if you're an achievement hunter... well, I wish you the best of luck. Achievements in the Poker Night are very logical and good ones, but some of them are connected to winning the hand with certain combination. And yeah, to made complete of this game, you need to get a straight flash.Well, again, good sides:1) Proper, enjoying poker. If you set difficult level at hard, it will be quite challenging. No, you'll not win every hand with all-in tactic, like some other reviews said. You gotta try to be a good player. A cool and smart one.2) Not only you'll be playing poker with worthy opponents, but they'll be entertaining you in the process! And every of them has a different behavior, which you'll need to learn for make sure you're winning.3) From those of us who are playing Team Fortress, the items you'll win should be a good reward to play a night or two in poker.Bad sides:1) No matter how clever and fun are the lines from all four your opponents, they are limited. And after you heard them all, in all combinations... it is not so fun anymore. And even beyond that point, sometimes, there are lines which feels out of order. Like when Heavy guy is folding cards before you, and then starting to banter you with something like ""In Mother Russia you're quit when you're dead"". C'mon, man, you're folded too!2) So the game wears off... but if you want it with complete achievements, you need damned staright flush! And that's a bummer. Chances to get that combination... not high.3) Finally, there are some stabilty issues, especially when you're trying to change skins of background. So after several attempts to change something, I decided to stick to the main theme, the reason of stability.I have two marks: ""Khorosho!"" (8/10) if you are playing for the items and not for long. And 7/10 - if you're collecting achievements and getting bored with all those repeating lines again and again.			"

												+ Visually appealing+ Funny dialogue, but gets repetative after a while+ Unlocks add incentive to play- Predictable AI is too easyEver wanted to listen to some of your favorite video game and internet characters say kinda funny things to each other while you play a basic poker game? Maybe? Well maybe you should give Poker Night at the Inventory a try. Naturally, the addition of character antics slows the game down quite a bit, so if you want to really play poker, this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off. Additionally, the character AI is very predictable after you've played for a bit. Tycho is conservative, Heavy is aggressive, Strong Bad likes to bluff, and Max is aggressive to the point of stupidity. Once you learn their tendencies and tells, the game becomes very easy.It's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of it. Good thing they made another one!73/100A great poker game for people who don't really play poker. Worth about 2 bucks at this point.			"

												Too bad tf2 items are the main reason many people are buying this game and, what's worse, most of these people don't even play it, they use cheats to unlock achievements to get their tf2 items.This game is surely entertaining even if you don't play tf2 and if you don't know any of these characters.Their dialogues and voice comments are still pretty funny and poker overall is pretty interesting game, of course if you bother to learn at least the basics of it before you start playing.Even losing in this game feels good, it's just a friendly game with interesting characters where there are fake money at stake.Better use this instead of gambling your real money, you know.And use the saved money to buy more tf2 items.Requested: list of tf2 items you can get from this game.[wiki.teamfortress.com] "

												If you're looking for some long story about how Sam, Tycho, the Heavy and Strong Bad all ended up playing poker ... well, there's not much of one. It's just the four of them hanging out and playing at The Inventory, an underground club that supposedly has its roots in Prohibiton, but offers nothing more than a setting. And that's fine, because really, this game doesn't have a need for a story. Visually, Poker Night's a good looking game. The Heavy, Strong Bad and Max all use models from Valve and Telltale's games, respectively, and their animations are very smooth. Tycho's model, on the other hand, is brand-new, and oddly enough, he's the one who looks a little out of place from time to time. There's also a few graphical glitches if you move the game along too fast: in one instance, I couldn't see my cards for an entire hand because they never actually loaded. I'd folded too quickly and skipped to the end of the hand before the game could make the change, it seems. Another cool little feature is that in the background, the characters will appear as you knock them out of the game. They don't do a whole lot, but it's kind of cool to see Strong Bad playing the arcade machine, or the Heavy at the bar after a bitter defeat at the table.Where Poker Night excels, though, is in the chatter at the table between the Heavy, Tycho, Strong Bad and Max. The scritping and the actual voice acting itself is spot-on, a testament to the abilities of whoever's responsible at Telltale for writing this game's dialogue. Tycho's voice is a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it the more you play, until it seems natural. What's also great is that each character's quirks are also included in their dialogue: for example, there are Heavy's ""funny"" stories about summer camp that are actually quite morbid, and Tycho's obsession/lust over giraffes makes it into the game, the latter of which made me laugh out loud the first time I heard it. In short, they've nailed the spirit of all four characters perfectly. My only complaint is that they engage each other, but never really bring the player into their conversations. You kind of feel more like an invisible observer than a player at the table with these guys for the bulk of the experience. Outside of their clever quips, the actual computer players seem... well, I'm not sure how to describe them. Maybe a bit erratic? At times, they seem to take unnecessarily big risks or make strange plays, like going almost all in and folding. At other times, the AI seems to know exactly what the flop, turn and river cards are going to be ahead of time, and is able to make strong bets based on that knowledge. I know part of poker is that the game can turn on its head with the draw of the right card and make a winning hand a losing one. But in Poker Night, it feels like those sudden moments are, at times, manufactured by the game more than they would occur naturally. Poker Night's gameplay pretty much boils down to good ol' fashioned Texas Hold 'Em, the kind you see on TV. It helps a bit if you know what beats what ahead of playing this game, as it makes it easier to gamble, but you can definitely pick up how to play over time. Navigating the in-game interface to make calls, raises and folds is relatively simple. Plus, in addition to the new items, winning games unlocks new tables and decks to play with, giving you the opportunity to customize the game's look a little bit.On the downside, there's not a whole lot else you can change. The AI has two difficulty options - normal and hard - and you can adjust the level of conversation that goes on as well as if it’s censored or not. But you can’t change anything about how much the buy-in is, presumably to keep people from somehow gaming the system to get the Team Fortress 2 items easily, what blinds start at, etc. Maybe adding in a few other options that unlocked once you had all of the items would have helped keep some replay value. All this boils down to Poker Night's biggest problem: it gets repetitive very quickly. Once you've heard Tycho and Heavy's tenth Class discussion for the twentieth time, it loses a lot of its initial charm. On top of that, with no real options to modify the game's stakes, you're always playing the same $10,000 buy-in game once you have the new Team Fortress 2 items. Thankfully, Telltale's included the option to right click through any conversation as a means of speeding up the game's pace and perhaps saving your sanity. The only bad part, of course, is right-clicking takes a lot of the fun out of the game because you're not getting those interactions anymore. In the end, for 4,99€, you can’t really go wrong, and this game delivers way more than the typical ultra-budget title. On top of all of the TF2 enhancements, you get the added fun of seeing some great characters in a funny setting. It's fun, it's cheap, and it gets you Team Fortress 2 upgrades while letting you play poker against a bunch of fun characters. It's a good game, even if you don't play TF2. The controls arent great and the poker isn't the best, but it's still a blast.			"

With added features, including gameplay based reactions and story based informative conversations between your playmates-characters from other well known games, Poker Night at The Inventory genuily creates a feeling of a poker tournament played with your friend as if you were really there.You will hear a few entertaining and interesting dialogues at The Inventory club, sadly a lot not so interesting or exciting ones. After a while I clicked through the most of them just to let the game continue. Althought there are some precious and fitting ones. My favourite is this one said by Tycho, because I'm Czech and its nice to see we are not totally unknown to the world ""Checking is lame. Unless you are Czech. Which I would find amusing."".5.5 /10 Slightly above average "

												NOTE: TL;DR can be found in the bottom of this review. Whether you're looking for a review made in 1 paragragh or in a multitude of them, I hope you enjoy the review(s).Moving along...I decided to do a small review on Poker Night @ the Inventory. It's a simple concept made for a simple video game based on a (simple on paper) complex card game called Poker which everyone probably knows.If you don't... well... shame on you, because it's really f*ckin' fun! (Avoid real money bets though, there's a high chance you'll lose your car, dog, wife, house or kids with all the betting and stuff...)Anyways, Poker is nicely recreated in this video game format... mostly.You play against popular video game franchise characters, naming Max (from the Sam and Max series), Strong Bad (I have no idea), Heavy Weapons Guy (from TF2) and that's it...The dialogue is well done, it's funny at times and it keeps the mood going without boring you. The fact that the AI is solid for the most part also helps a lot. However, after a couple of hours, the dialogue WILL repeat itself over and over, making you skip it constantly after 3 hours of play, which isn't very good, as you can probably tell.The gameplay is basic poker, you got your flushes, straights (and hom... bad joke, sorry), full houses (which you won't have if you play on casinos, more like ""empty houses"" hahaha, get it?! God, what's wrong with me?), two-pairs, your classic ""poker"" and more...Everything plays as it should... like a poker game...There is one thing lacking though... and that is the possibility to bluff.You can bluff, sure. I mean I did go ""All-In"" when everything I had was a ""pair of twos"" or an ""Ace-High"" and all the AI ended up folding. Bunch of chicken ♥♥♥♥♥...Anyways, it felt like luck more than anything else, bluffing is supposed to make you feel good, you can trick people into thinking you have a full poker of Aces when in fact, you only possess a joker and a Magic: The Gathering card. Where do you think the expression ""Poker Face"" comes from? Exactly...The lack of a bluff system (which no poker video game can ever do, I think... maybe ""Next-Gen"" can fix that, LOL!) takes away a bit of the strategy of the game. However, it's enough to make the game fun enough to play, to listen to the characters talk (Heavy and Max are awesome, Strong Bad came to me as annoying) and to generally, have a good time!And I had indeed, a good time! Even the luck felt PERFECTLY balanced to either f*ck me, or f*ck one (or more) of the opponents, not too unfair or fair for me. I actually remember ending up the very first round of the match going All-In alongside 2 other characters, which was hilarious!********************************TL;DR**************************************I'm dragging a bit here, so, sorry. Anyways, funny dialogue that can get repetitive after a while (but that's expected), nicely balanced luck (in my case), basic poker gameplay, nothing special to talk about the gameplay. And finally, you get TF2 stuff! Only problems I had were related to frustrating luck (some matches in a row just weren't clicking for me) and the lack of bluffing (quite impossible in video game format). OH! AND NO MULTIPLAYER!!!! WTF, TELLTALE?!So overall, I had fun. The game costs (only) 3,99€, on sale, you can get it for 0,99€ or even less! It's a perfect game to spend your time in work breaks (lengthier matches won't last more than ~45 minutes (and even that's pushing it!)).The obligatory gaming industry scoring system for Poker Night @ the Inventory is an arbitrarily pointless 8/10.Small review my ♥♥♥!

""I AM SORRY. I DO NOT HAVE THIS MONEY... I DID, BUT SASHA HAS BEEN VERY GOOD LATELY, AND I WANTED TO GET HER GIFTS. THE MONEY IS GONE. I HAVE NO CHOICE...""Telltale Games - these dudes got it in their name. They're able to put some kind of story even into the poker based game. Isn't that awesome? Instead of basic poker game with just table and cards on table, no dialogues, annoying dealer and just that feeling when the only thing you are focusing on are the cards, Poker Night at the Inventory make you feel that you're really part of the game, part of the table and fellas around you are ""real"". Graphics are just awesome, dialogues are very very very-well written, your company is well-choosen. Most probably it'll get repetetive after 100/200 hands but when you play for special items, it really freshen up the gameplay. Dialogues are also very repetetive after while, but they are so great, that possibility it gets annoying for you is very low.After few hours in, when you win all the items, and fully enjoy it and all you want to to before uninstalling the game is 100% achievements, the fact that few of them are luck based really ruin the day for you. Getting Straight Flush or Quads is really rare. Me myself, I got Quads twice and Straight Flush once. It's random algorithm so some of you may get Straight Flush even at the start of your very first hand.This game cost 4,99 dollars, during sale 0,99. If we take into consideration, what kind of stupid and bad games are there available for way more than that, 0,99 is absolutely nothing and don't even think twice about it. Same goes with Poker Night at the Inventory 2.However, Governor of Poker 2 is better game for me, as it was that thing which brought me into real-life and online poker. Hopefully I'll do review for GoP2 soon, and I fully recommend you those three games if you're fan of poker!Bonus Point: Strong BadRating: 7/10 "

												I am recommending this game solely for the humor between the various characters in it - they are, for the most part, witty and original, and their nicknames for eachother are great (Heavy calls Strongbad ""Tiny Heavy"", during some great moments). The only character I was very whatever about was Tycho, he comes off as a pompous annoying know-it-all, but it only gives the others an opportunity to crack wise at his expense. The actual gamepay should be simple enough right? No. The poker mechanics are horrendous. On occassion you will find that a pair of whatevers will beat a flush, or any other weird combination. The actual gameplay has been riddled with bugs like this since release, and that was several years ago. This is the major downside to this game, but the humor completely makes it worth it nonetheless.Another minor downside, if you can even call it that, is that the achievements are moronic. One achievement asks you to get a straight flush, the probability of getting that in Texas Hold 'Em ""is approximately 0.0311% (0.0032% for royal flush and 0.0279% for non-royal straight flush)"". Other such achievements include ""Get a hand with 3 kings"", ""Get 4 of a kind"", and so on. While sure, getting these cards would be quite an achievement, it is still a major nuisance if it is the only achievement you lack from having 100% of the achievements - even for someone (like myself) who does not strive for 100%'ing achievements, lacking that ONE achievement would make anyone want to go for it.Nonetheless, game is recommended still, it is very funny and witty, and makes for a great pastime.

Everything is better with a group of friends!Everyone knows doing pretty much anything feels more fun with a group of frineds, or even just with fun and friendly people. And that's how Poker Night at the Inventory feels like!The players in Poker Night at the Inventory may not be the most friendly ones but they certainly are fun to listen to. You are placed in a poker table with Max from Sam & max, Heavy from Team Fortress 2, Tycho from Penny Arcade and Strong Bads from Homestar Runner. If you are familiar with these names you may notice that they aren't the most friendly faces but that doesn't mean it'd be annoying or unfun to listen to them while they're babbling about random stuff.Aside from the funny dialogue theres not much going on with the game. It's Texas Hold'em with colorful characters and neat graphics. It's basic yet fun. If you are fan of Texas Hold'em and video games you will most likely enjoy this game.One of the main selling points for this game are the rewards your opponents can place as a bet if they don't have enough cash with them. If you win them in a hand and they run out of cash you will get rewarded with their unique item they just bet in. You will be awarded with an Achievement and an in-game item for Team Fortress 2. If you are not a fan of Team Fortress 2 the rewards will be quite useless.Poker Night at the Inventory is a fine game. It may not be the most polished one but it holds up as a Texas Hold'em game very well. It has unique style and fun characters and is a game that feels fun to jump into a match of Hold'em while listening to them talk. If you get annoyed of them or you've heard all of their jokes million times you can always mute them. So if you are looking for a solid Texas Hold'em game with some chracter this is just the right game for you. Although if you are not familiar with video game culture you may not understand any of the jokes since they pretty much revolve around the characters and their universes.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												So, Poker Night At The Inventory, the game where you play Texas Hold'em with a rabbit, 2 out-of-the-ordinary people, and... whatever the hell Strong Bad isSeriously though, this game is amazing, I absolutely love it.I assume the majority of us got this game for the tf2 items. If you are one of those people, or you're a fan of Sam & Max,  Homestar Runner, the Penny Arcade webcomics, or a poker player in general, I'd recommend this game to you in a heartbeat.The story is as simple as who you play as: you are known as ""The Player"", a silent poker player who's arrived at the inventory to play poker with 4 other fellows. The Inventory is a secret poker place hidden from society in case those ""in charge"" decide to essentially ban Poker for a second time.There you have it, that's the story: Nothing more, nothing less is known about you; the rest is playing some number of games of Texas Hold'em with the Heavy (tf2), Sam (Sam & Max), Strong Bad (Homestar Runner), and Tycho (Penny Arcade webcomics) for stakes of $10k.Now onto the aspects of the game:Graphics [9/10] - The graphics are their own personality, likewise the characters' models match their respective traitsAssets [7.8/10] - I run a fairly average computer with a lot of memory left, yet I run at somewhere between 30-40 fps ingameAI [9.8/10] - The ai of the game is, I feel, unbelievably realisticSoundtrack [10/10] - The soundtrack is stupendous, I love it: I listen to this whenever I need think music playingAtmosphere [10/10] - Between the soundtrack, the dialouge from the characters, the game looks and feels amazing and almost believable to be sitting down playing poker with these charactersOverall score [8.7/10] - The big killer for me was the fact that the second game runs much more smoother, despite having more stuff going on: other than that, this game would've gottten a 9.6/10			"

However there are many achievements to unlock, items to collect and even free unlocks for Team Fortress 2.The witty dialogue between your opponants gives you immersion into their world and the background music, which I enjoy immensely, comforts you at the table.I've owned this game for many years and I still pop back for a round of cards with these chumps.

												If you're buying it for the character roster, get it- Listening to conversations about whether or not Max shtupt Mama Boscow or Heavy trying to get Strong Bad to join RED team is really enjoyable.If you're buying it for the TF2 items, get it*- As far as I know the weapons you can get from this game have been patched so that they are untradable. This is the only way to get them (but bare in mind you'll actually have play the game to earn them).* [ Don't take my word for it though. If you're a trader I wouldn't bother.]If you're buying it for the poker, don't bother-As far as I can tell, there are WAY better poker games on steam (quite a few I've seen that are worth less) so if you want to play poker, get one of those instead.That's my view of the game, but you should probably check some other reviews first. My experience of the game is pretty limited, so you might to look at some reviews that are better than mine (which is all of them). There. I've shut up now. Thanks for reading			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun distraction, but I felt the only reason I had any emotional investment in it is that I wanted to win the Team Fortress 2 items which are only available through this game. This made me ask myself ""If I don't buy items in TF2, why did I buy this game to get some TF2 items?"" I suppose the answer is that I get to play a game in the process of obtaining those items, but the AI seems much too random in betting patterns to provide a truly enjoyable poker experience. Which means you are really just working to earn those TF2 items; and on top of that you have to pay money just for the privilege to work for them. I'd say buy this if you want to win the TF2 items, but if it's poker you're after there's surely better games out there. Or better yet just grab a real deck of cards and host your own poker night with your mates. 3 out of 10, would not bet.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Poker Night at the Inventory is a game developed and published by Telltale GamesThe game is visually appealing however there were some frame rate drops here and there sometimes. The game offers some funny dialogue but can get repetative after a while and the unlocks add incentive to continue playing the gameOne major flaw in Poker Night at the Inventory is the very predictable AI which makes the game too easyIt's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of itPoker Night at the Inventory is a great poker game for people who don't really play poker RECOMMENDED :)  "

												It's a freaking poker game. How can it not be more straight forward than that. The side conversations and the unlocks are nice. As it stands however. The game isn't all that great. For three simple reasons1) Facing the same characters over and over again. No multiplayer. And no ""DLC"" or ""extra content"" where you can switch out the other characters for brand new faces. While it is nice to hear the side conversations. It can get pretty old. Pretty fast.2) Luck. Now while this may sound dumb and stupid. There are instances where you might have a lousy hand, but! In some odd concidence you won. Outta nowhere! Where as the other card players could've easily beaten you. Now this might be a game mechanic or just sheer dumb luck. Whatever the case maybe this shouldn't be a thing.3) Weird A.I. Now, if this was against other players then the game might be more fun. But the A.I. in this game is weird, For example, and depending upon how lucky you are when you start a new tournament. The other card players might go all in. Outta nowhere! Which means if you got a great hand than the other opponents. You might actually win the game right away with no real sense of tension OR knock out half of the competition before the game can really progress anywhere.In the end Poker Night is a perfect game for Poker fans and achievement hunters. Yes, this game does have a tutorial and a cheat sheet to understand the 'card hands' and whatnot. But like what I stated; luck really runs the show in the game. If not then the weird A.I. does. If your an achievement hunter and a poker fan. This game might be up your alley. But for anyone else, you might want to pass.			"

												A grand poker game featuring some great characters and hilarious (though crude) dialogue. As far as card games and gambling games go, I grew up on Hoyle Casino. This is much less serious, but I find that I actually enjoy it more for a short pickup game here and there.The game isn't exactly overflowing with content, achievements or deep progression but it also does not require an overflowing wallet to pick up.If you sometimes enjoy kicking back for 20-30 minutes and just playing an amusing round of Texas Hold'em then I would definitely consider adding this to your Steam Library!

												everybody loves gambling but no one wants to lose money, oh wait a sec. this game is for people who either know how to gamble and like it or people who want to learn how to gamble. In Poker night at the inventory you play the game texas holdem (gambling isnt poker poker is a seprate game so the name makes no sense) texas holdem is probably the simplest gambling game I know of, each player gets 2 cards and who ever gets the highest card combo wins. the charecters in this game is Strong bad who is by far the most ""up him self"" funny, Max, well I love max, I remember me and my friend playing sam and max save christmas together, it was challenging, hillarious and really run, tycho, I don't really know much about him so I cant quite say much about him, The Heavy, oh my god this beast of a man made it in to a underground cassino (how the hell?) this guy is off tf2, if you don't know what tf2, you are missing a big piece of your life. to conclude this review I would reccomend this game to as I said before: people who want to learn how to gamble and people who like playing gambling games.

												This game really shouldn't be listed as Mac-compatible when it doesn't work on any OS X version over 10.8. Basically the MAXIMUM OS you can be on is Lion. It's like saying the game is Windows-compatible, as long as you're on Vista or older.Only wasted a quid, thankfully. But definitely not impressed that I couldn't get past the tutorial cutscene to actually play the game because the devs just can't be bothered to update it.			"

AUDIOHilariousVISUALCobbled TogetherDIFFICULTYAverageVIBERelaxingCRAVINGPokerON SALEFrequentlyPROS: TF2 items seem to be the main reason many even bother with this, but it's a fun game on its own. Lots of deck and table options, some with cool on-screen effects. Bantering between characters is funny, it's interesting to watch this motley crew come together under one roof. CONS: Weirdly laggy during the beginning intro and generally not well optimized. No display for your current hand means a potential win may slip by. There is no way to completely silence the characters, making their more long-winded checks and folds annoying (especially after a long time playing.) Texas Hold 'Em only?? Where's seven-card stud!WORTH: As the best Poker game on steam currently, I believe this game is worth full-price. If you play TF2, you're going to get items for it, to boot!OVERALL: It's a shame people are brute-forcing this game for TF2 items and uninstalling.  You knuckle-draggers might've looked a little more distinguished after a few games of Poker. Like a monkey in a hat. Nevertheless, if you are having trouble getting all the items and achievements for this game, I have a comprehensive guide you can check out!SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

Lost all game progress, unlocks, etcThis game breaking bug has been widely reported since the launch back in 2010. The devs haven't done anything about it. Would be so easy to use steam cloud. I was looking forward to complete the game as I wasn't far from it and now I've just been set back all the way to the very start.

												It's good I guess. I played Poker Night 2 first and I felt bit spoiled here. You play with half the money then the sequel but you get to play with new characters at the same cost as the sequel. You play with Tyron (whoever the ♥♥♥♥ he is), The Heavy (Or Heavy Weapons Guy), Max and Strong Bad with the owner being the dealer which made me miss Glados as the dealer. I just miss her little insults she would make at you but to make up for it, it has a more friendly astmosphere to it. Instead of having Ash and Claptrap having a passive agressive talk with each other, You got The Heavy having a friendly talk with Max about his childhood which I like because it feels less compative and more a friendly match but with this, you get a lot more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This game is more unfair to you since I somehow got a flush which then gets beat by someone getting a royal flush out of  ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and when you finally got some money, its very little. I mean, I won a match with a royal flush and get $900 from the main pot while THE ♥♥♥♥ING HEAVY GETS $380000 FROM THE ♥♥♥♥ING SIDE POT WITH A PAIR OF 2s. THAT IS JUST SO MUCH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. You can change the difficulty which is a ♥♥♥♥ing lie since you are stuck to normal and you can't change jackshit. You can change the table conversations which yet again does jackshit and you have to turn on the strong langauge which is just so stupid. Hey Telltale, I'm playing Poker by myself in my room. I highly doubt I'm a 8 year old who can buy stuff from steam by myself.There is more to talk about but it's just more whining. I only recommend this if you like Poker Night 2 and want to see the characters and here more lines or want the poker version of Dark Souls.			"

												Here's my review for Poker night at the inventory.Let's begin shall weWell honestly not much to say about a game like this, its just mainly poker as the name suggests but with a few extras here and there.Gameplay wise its very well placed you are first welcomed with a nice introduction. Then the real game begins but its just poker as we know not much to say here but fully perfect at what it does.It is really addicting though now it makes me wanna play poker in real.Graphical options are many. On low still look pretty  considerable.Sound track well luckily its very good and catchy as well, makes poker fun in another way.Characters well some interesting one's here. you have heavy from (teamfortress 2) obviously. Max (the bunny) from sam and max. Strong bad from what i dont even know of actually. Lastly tycho from a comic or something.Now having all those characters really makes it into a interesting game, sometimes heavy tells you a story (though mostly hes sad awww). Max well the most least serious and mindless character here as when any of the other characters lose they always show angry faces while sam hes always cool. Strong bad well this is one angry fcker. And tycho well best way to describe him would be to say he always folds unless he has a very good set thus making it most harder to beat him.Promotional tf2 (teamfortress 2) and Borderlands 2 in-game items. A neat addition.Over all worth it?Surely if you are interested in a poker game at all this is worth a try. Good for tf2 items if you wanna get it alone just for that. A recommend game at only a price of $4.99 dollars fully worth its value.A poker game as the name suggests, well paced, polished,great ost,nice presentation and good graphics for its genre.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator "

												Much like my experience with Poker Night 2 I freely admit that I didn't have a lot of familiarity with the characters. I don't read Homestar Runner, Penny Arcade, or Sam & Max, and I don't play Team Fortress 2. Still, I feel like I've gotten to know all of them a little bit better through their table banter.Seems like it's become my pattern to play sequels before playing the first installments of any series. The absence of a dealer character in this game is jarring after coming from GLaDos, plus the purely cosmetic effects of Table and Deck themed skins felt a little light.Fun game but I must once again make a note of my hatred of luck-based Achievements. I need a Four of A Kind and a Straight Flush for my last two Achievements and it really sucks.			"

												Cons:-Could have done so much more with the game to build off of a great themed poker idea to keep players entertained, unboard and replayability. -Got boring after the 5th tournament.  Same thing over and over and nothing new other than winning 4 in-game items that only TF2 new players would want as they have no items of real value to put into their slots.-Conversation settings need to be turned on High in the Options menu to get the most & best conversations in the game.Pros:-Cards randomization feels fairly accurate to real-life, something that almost all video games & poker sites stuggle with.-Cool poker themed game with a 'Rounder's NYC Feel.-With the conversation settings turned on high, surprisingly there are a lot of conversations where I didn't feel bored or even heard the same conversation twice in a full gaming session, and surprisingly colorful stories that was unexpected.-Has a nice optimization & action mechanics that's welcomed.-I waited a year until it went on a real sale and purchased it for $.80 cents for I & II.  Being 30 years old growing up during the arcade days, we spent like $10-$20 a day where that kind of money actually meant something of value, just on quarters in order to play 1 round on a arcade machine.  So I look at it as fair entertainment value for my money, even if i'll only play it once or twice in my life.  I knew this before purchasing it and decided to purchase it for the experience to see what it was all about and to say to myself I played it.If u get it on an amazing $1 sale then feel free to pick it up for the exp, but you can also pass on this game and not miss out on anything in this current gaming era.★★☆☆☆ Mediocre Game - 2/5 Stars			"

												I don't have much time playing this, but whenever I do boot it up it never ceases to be worth my time. Out of all the games, I guess that Poker Night is what puts me through a rollercoast of emotions the most. I get bummed out, I get super happy, I start getting cocky and then I am reminded of my humbleness by Heavy and his horseapple hand.What I most like about this game is that it has some things that few single-player poker games have: different AIs and bluffs. If you pay enough attention, you can figure out the different playstyles of your opponents, whether the hand is good or not for them and even if they are bluffing.And like every poker game, a lot of weird stuff happens here too. For example, this last tournament I was in: one of the hands consisted in a flush. On the table. Everybody gets a flush. YOU get a flush! And YOU get a flush!But I had the ace so I won the hand. On the same tournament, it was down to me and Max. Max had 500 dollars. I won with an ace high.Insane things like these is what makes Poker Night at the Inventory a remarkable card game, and if you love yourself some poker and you do not have the money to splurge on actual tournaments, I sincerely reccomend this to you. I bought it a couple of summer sales ago along with its sequel and ""Papers, Please"" for the grand total of 20 reais (about 10 dollars). Even if it's not summer sale, I'd say this game is worth its price.Some things that do upset me a little are the little sound bugs here and there, and sometimes it does freeze as if it is thinking. Also the mouse sensibility is stupendously weird and no matter how much I fiddle with the settings I can't get it to work normally. I guess my mouse will be drunk forever whenever I'm playing this game.Also, the subtitles censor the word t w a t. I don't find that upsetting, I just find it unnecessary.			"

												I will be brief. ""Poker Night"" is the kind of game you just wanna enjoy sitting back and playing. Sure it's unpleasant at times if these opponents pull a fast one on you and somehow come out on top with that River card out of nowhere, but other than having variable luck (mainly against your favor), it's a pretty fun game. Besides, there are times where the cards may go in your favor making your all-in bet not such a bad thing after all. There's amazingly cool graphics and wonderful dialogue to help add to the fun atmosphere. And the storyline behind this game is admittedly well-thought out.If you're a card gamer that enjoys some good Texas Hold 'Em, or if you're a guy who just loves to laugh along with some crazy, witty one-liners from pretty well-known gaming/comic/television celebrities, this game may be right up your alley. Or should I say right up your winning hand? :P			"

												I must say, I actually only bought this game for the Lugermorph and i thought it would be boring, but its actually a really nice game. The characters have nice catchphrases, the heavy is so funny when he loses and overall, its just a great game!Please dont just buy this game and get the items, take some time and enjoy the game yourself.

												Words cannot express how much hype I had when I first saw the trailer for this. All of the characters (except for Tycho, who I was honestly unfamiliar with at the time) together was just something so hard for me to process. I also somehow didn't expect it to actually be a poker game before release, so I had to learn it.Thankfully this game is pretty easy to handle once you get the feel for it. I think most sales honestly came from TF2, where you get some unlocks from this game. But I honestly find myself revisiting this every now and then just to hear all the characters talk to each other. Especially Strong Bad and Heavy, like TF2 and Homestar Runner together was a huge thing for me. Almost disappointing all classes couldn't wear the Dangeresque shades, but I still wore them proudly.Actually diving into it. Of course all the characters are amazing, granted you recognize them all. And it provides for some  amazing talk between them all (and you will eventually hear all the lines if you play it enough). You get rewarded (as said above) not only for TF2, but you can also unlock different tabletops and stuff. Granted you're good enough at poker unlike me. In the end, it's really just that. A well planned out and put together poker game with 4 very memorable characters all from different series.Unfortunately Poker Night 2 was an unfair mess that was truly annoying (at least in my opinion) and had sorta boring unlocks for TF2. Forgetting about that. If you wanna see Homestar Runner, Sam & Max, Penny Arcade, and the TF2 universe combined just to play a simple game of poker, this is definitely worth the $5.			"

												It's really that type of game. Get the TF2 drops, some of the achievements, and get outta there. This game will keep you occupied for a very small amount of time (as you can probably see by my hours). After that, it's the game you play when you have no internet connection and just want to pass the time. The graphics are a simulation of cancer for your eyes, so if you want better looks, Poker Night 2 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/234710/) redirects here. I was pleasantly surprised at the price of this game, so if you're not too strapped for cash, it might be worth it for you.For its price, a good quality game, I'd rate 7.5/10.EDIT: I'd like to add that the AIs are easily beaten, and again this is improved in Poker Night 2 (link above).

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun and surprisingly complex poker simulation. As someone who has pretty much no real experience with poker before playing this game, it's good at explaining the rules and immersing you into the game quickly and simply. There's that addictive quality of ""just one more round"", hoping to increase your balance, or to get the varied achievements or new items, that's a mark of quality in a turn-based game.But of course the real draw of Poker Night at the Inventory is the characters. If you're a fan of Homestar Runner, Team Fortress 2, Penny Arcade, or Sam & Max, or even if you aren't, the characters are going to make you laugh and come back for more. The dialogue is pretty fantastic, with all kinds of fun and dark humor (wait until you hear The Heavy's story about the Engineer). All of the characters fit well into their canon personalities, and even have playing styles that reflect them (e.g. Strong Bad likes to bluff and act all macho with large bets, so he can be vulnerable to called bluffs but is unpredictable about how good his hand really is). This is what really brings the immersion into the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who's interested in poker and/or the IPs involved in the game. It can give you hours of fun, laughs, and a decent challenge for a pretty low price.			"

I think.As awful as I am at this game, I still come back to it every once in a while whenever I'm really bored or sad. It's a game you can quickly pick up and play, no matter what mood you're in, and have a good, relaxing time. It's fun to hear the wide variety of different dialogue between all 4 characters (even when only knowing 2 of them!) and the music is just so... chillax. The free TF2 items you can earn from the game are the cherry on top to this great little game.Finally, just to reiterate: Heavy and Strong Bad in the same game.

												A reasonable implementation of a single player texas hold em game, with some mildly amusing banter from the eclectic players present to keep you interested for a while, although definitely in the realm of very casual poker players only.The main feature here is going to be the characters brought together in the game rather than the game itself, and it is fun and interesting for a while to see them interact within the confines of a poker game, and they do each represent a fairly distinct style of play (possibly too extreme) to mix things up and add interest to the gameplay, so whether you will like this game is likely to be based on whether you find the four chosen characters/personas interesting or not.One negative is that annoying last achievement to get a straight flush, lets just say unless you are very lucky the banter is going to feel very repetitive by the time you get it.

												From the creaters of the Sam and Max games, here comes Poker Night at the Inventory. The games setting is in a secret hideout known as The Inventory, where people from various medias hang out and play some poker games. You play Texas Hold Em and compete against Max from Sam and Max, Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner videos, Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Tycho from Penny Arcades and find out who will go big or go home. There's not too much to say about this game, it's just Texas Hold Em. Occasionaly someone will toss in a buy in if they are short on cash, being able to win the buy in will unlock an exclusive item in TF2 like Strong Bad's Dangeresque Too? Glasses and others. The dialouge between the players is always fun to watch after a hand. The conversations with Heavy and Tycho are funny as Heavy thinks Tycho is part of BLU Team as well as the ones with Strong Bad and Heavy and how Heavy finds him to be a smaller version of himself, or Tiny Heavy as he likes to call him. The one thing this game needs is Online play, it would be cool having more players in on the event or have them play as the multi-media characters. So in conclusion, Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun poker game where you don't have to waste realy money in order to play through the game. And since the game usually sells at $5.00 and features exclusive content in TF2, ya can't go wrong there.			"

The Dialogue is hilarious (and hilariously stupid sometimes) the graphics are....pretty, they're not the best but not the worst at all. And the gameplay it's kind of good for a little poker game (i actually learned quite a few things from this game) and the TF2 items are just the cherry on top of the cake, you should buy it now if you ever wanted to see Strong-Bad, Max, Heavy and Thyco in the same game..well, there ya go!

It makes me go trough alot, if  your interested in pokering you should've bought this game. Also if you love to play the game ""Team Fortress 2"" you can buy it to win the items, it can be hard to win them so note that you need to know how pokering works.

												Ok now, you can't hide it and you don't have to, you, like most people out there bought this game for the TF2 items and well.... I did too. So why am i doing this review if the only thing i did was getting those bloody items? Simple, the game dragged me in more than it should've and i say it's pretty impressing for a poker game! The Dialogue is hilarious (and hilariously stupid sometimes) the graphics are....pretty, they're not the best but not the worst at all. And the gameplay it's kind of good for a little poker game (i actually learned quite a few things from this game) and the TF2 items are just the cherry on top of the cake, you should buy it now if you ever wanted to see Strong-Bad, Max, Heavy and Thyco in the same game..well, there ya go! This is the perfect game :3			"

												Let’s face it; most people buy this game purely for the items you can earn for yourself on team fortress 2.If that really is the only reason why you are on the store page, then there are ways of getting those items relatively quickly.It took me around 3 hours to get all 4 of the items, and I personally don’t think that is too shabby, the AI in this game is pretty bad… and easy to manipulate, or at least that is what I thought. All I did was start up a game, if one of them puts their item up, great, carry on, if not… I restarted the game until one of them did. And from there, went all-in every hand in a complete gamble, because sometimes they call and you knock them out and get their item right there. You can do it any way you like, but if you are lazy like me and can’t be bothered, it’s a fairly easy way to “earn” those items. And hey hoe it only left me around $600,000 in debt.On the other hand, if you are looking at this game, not for the items, but for actual gameplay… there isn’t really much you can say, as mentioned before the AI in this game is terrible, it is repetitive and you can start to sus out patterns that the characters have. Their dialog you can tell is trying to be laid back, friendly chum-to-chum talk with one another, and in all fairness some of it is amusing… the first 5 times. The dialog is so frequent and repetitive that after a little while, I really started to get annoyed with what they were saying. I don’t play many poker type games with the gambling and whatnot, but the feel from the game isn’t what I would imagine a real person interested in poker would be looking for. It doesn’t feel like real poker… or a real game… it seems dumbed down.Now that I have gotten all the items, I really don’t think I will ever be playing this game again.  "

												Ok, before I start this review, let me just say I DID get this game for the TF2 items. But while doing so I found out this game is really funny and entertaining! The conversations the characters have are hilarious, the game is fun, and the setting is pretty good! It's also helping me play poker. But anyway, I totally reccomend this game! It's just a short and sweet game about poker with some laughs and unlockables. It's enjoyable, so I recomend it. :)			"

												This game is precisely what it claims to be - poker with interesting characters that have amusing dialogue during play. Probably won't be enjoyable if you have zero interest in poker, but might be enjoyable if you like poker but are not familiar with the characters. It also has a guide to poker, so you don't need to be familiar with it, the game will teach you how to play.A few hours in, while some of the conversations are repeats, there's enough variety that it's still cool to listen to. I especially like the occasions when Strong Bad manages to get on Tycho's nerves. In general, Tycho has great lines, Strong Bad and Heavy are good, and Max... not so much.In terms of atmosphere, the visuals are good and consistent enough between the characters, and there's nice relaxing background music. Some of it sounds like a jazz-lounge version of the Team Fortress 2 music.Overall, I quite enjoy the game.			"

												Admit it. You came for TF2 items. So did I. However, when I started to play I realized what a good game for such a cheap price (1.24 USD during the holidays). It is funny. It is fun. And it taught me how to play a new game of poker with entertaining dialouge from characters from your favorite games. Definitely should buy on sale and I would wholeheartedly reccommend for 4.99. Go play and see how good it is yourself. And thoes sweet demoman shades don't hurt at all. :)			"

												Has a couple of game-breaking bugs that really make this game not worth it. Random progress reset is widely reported, but no fix in sight. Also, the AI has random phrases that they say, and they quickly become very old. Even when selecting the lowest chat setting, they still have 15 second long rambling monologues every second time you fold or call, often twenty or thirty of the same phrases in the same poker game.

												Telltale Games Nice try...Well I love Texas Hold'em Poker and this was a decent try from Telltale Games. It's fun to cure boredom but that is mostly it, The comments from Max (Sam & Max), Strong Bad, Heavy Weapons Guy (TF2) and Tycho are funny as hell, but only for the first  2 tourneys, then you have heard them all about 20 times and you find yourself right clicking constantly to skip the chatter, Even setting the Chat settings lower doesn't seem to help. Also the game mechanics and AI poker skills aren't really steady , One game an AI will play super tight and the next tourney that same AI plays every hand and goes all in with cards like 5,8 Off suite before the flop... What I am getting at is that it's a fun game for when your internet is down and you are bored but don't buy it expecting it to be the WOSP.My Rating - 1/5			"

												*DISCLAMER!*DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO PLAY ON A MAC! It has this bug, where the game crashes whenever you start the game. It sadly just does not work for Mac computers! I repeat DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO PLAY ON A MAC! Anyway, on to the review.As all people, I got pulled into the game because of the items and I'm honestly glad I did because I would of never invested this money into the game. This game is so much fun, and you could literally spend hours just listening to the hilarious dialog between the characters, and is a decent poker simulator. However I am still VERY salty about no mac support for this game, but it really doesn't matter too much unless you have just a mac. If you're on the verge of buying this game my one word of advice is DO IT. I'm no Shia LaBeouf but I'm telling you get this game, trust me it's not going to sit in your library collecting dust(or maybe it is but you get my point), so just get it already. I love this game and I hope this review helped. Also the straight flush achievement is impossible so don't bother.			"

												*DISCLAMER!*DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO PLAY ON A MAC! It has this bug, where the game crashes whenever you start the game. It sadly just does not work for Mac computers! I repeat DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO PLAY ON A MAC! Anyway, on to the review.As all people, I got pulled into the game because of the items and I'm honestly glad I did because I would of never invested this money into the game. This game is so much fun, and you could literally spend hours just listening to the hilarious dialog between the characters, and is a decent poker simulator. However I am still VERY salty about no mac support for this game, but it really doesn't matter too much unless you have just a mac. If you're on the verge of buying this game my one word of advice is DO IT. I'm no Shia LaBeouf but I'm telling you get this game, trust me it's not going to sit in your library collecting dust(or maybe it is but you get my point), so just get it already. I love this game and I hope this review helped. Also the straight flush achievement is impossible so don't bother.			"

												Includes 4 familiar characters + 4 unlockable items for TF2. The game is Texas Holdem, there are in-game instructions on how to play it. The lines are pretty funny for the first 2 hours and then the lines eventually repeats - which means the game could of used more lines. Everytime you win in a poker match, you can unlock ingame skins for the poker table and the deck of cards. I would of also liked it if there were more card games to play.Cons: buggy engine, laggy transitions, short on lines, lack of multiplayerFor a game with a very cheap price tag, it's worth getting.

												Nothing like sitting down to a good ol' fashion poker game, except when you sit down with a couple of crazy characters that are both disturbed and flawed on their out looks of life.  You will laugh at the pure insanity of Max, the egotistical Strong Bad, the unrealenting asshattery of Tycho, and the killing machince of TF2 that is which known as The Heavy.  There is different settings of which type of table talking banter you want to hear and different settings and skins of the tables and cards to some what switch to your likings.  The game is fun if you want to sit down and chill and just play a few hands of poker or just listen to a bunch of idiots ramble.			"

												It's okay.  It doesn't take long for the dialog to get repetitive (though there is quite a lot of it, it doesn't take long to play a lot of hands).  As other reviews have noted, the players have patterns that come clear quickly, and their betting habits are unreasonable... raising triple the minimum bet with very little chance of getting better than a Queen high.  It kind of becomes unfun because some of the patterns seem to be trying to give you wins.As a TF2 player, but not a fan of the other franchises, I would have liked this more if it had been all TF2 characters.  It's interesting to see the Heavy while playing a card game.Honestly, I got it for the TF2 unlocks.  It's a fun game, but none of the AI seems very competitive, and the play becomes a bit dully repetitive about the time the dialog becomes repetitive.It's fun to play for awhile and worth it if you catch it on sale for less than $5.

												Like everybody else, I got this game for TF2-related reasons.  Also, I know pretty much nothing about poker.  In fact, I jumped into this game without knowing how to play poker at all.  So yeah, I can't tell you whether or not it's a good poker simulator.  Though I have the feeling that it's not, because I was actually able to win quite a few hands using a really stupid strategy where I just kept going all-in over and over, which scared the AI players and caused them to fold.  You'd think they would catch on that I was bluffing after a few turns, but they don't.I really like the dialogue in this game, they chose good characters to include and it's great to hear them interact.  I only wish there was more dialogue when it's down to two players, because the last remaining AI doesn't really chat with you at all.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory was gifted to me by a good friend. I was unsure at first but excited when I recieved the gift as I did not know how to play poker but I knew once I learnt I could win prizes for Team Fortress 2! The first tournament I played, had me crowned the victor! Even though I was just guessing the rules and really didn't know what I was doing at all!When I started learning the game, I began to lose my winning streak and haven't actually won a tournament since! The characters at the table are very fun to play against, the Heavy is a favourite of mine as well as Max (Max inspired me to buy the entire 3 seasons of Sam and Max!). Though I did not know who Strong Bad was or Tycho, but it doesn't matter really... The conversations that the players have seem quite real, and I like how when someone is interrupted, they will continue their conversation by saying something like ""anyway"" or ""as I was saying"" which adds to the realisticness. The only real problem with the game so far is when Tycho occasionally has a spasm and moves around in his seat rapidly and sometimes when dialogue is repeated. I also like how when a player is busted out they can be seen in the background doing many different things!Poker Night at the Inventory is a decent casual game and I recommend it for fans of poker, Team Fortress 2, Sam and Max, whatever Strong Bad and Tycho are from and people who want to learn poker!

PresenationPoker Night at the Inventory isn't the most authentic and packed poker experience out there, mostly because it was never meant to be, but it is among the most enjoyable virtual poker experiences while it lasts. You will be simply known as the Player, a newcomer to the secret poker club known as the Inventory, taking part in five players tournaments against four memorable characters from different franchises, not only in the video games industry, but comics and video series as well. You will play against Max from Telltale's own Sam & Max franchise, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Tycho from Penny Arcade, and the Heavy from Team Fortress 2, characters that have absolutely nothing common, yet still manage to lighten up the mood at the poker table. Poker Night's magic comes from the conversation between those characters, which consists mostly of jokes and references, and while some were meant to be little easter eggs for fans of a particular franchise, most jokes appeal to a generic audience, making them hilarious even if you're not that familiar with the characters. A short introduction to each of your adversaries would've been welcome to familiarize the player with their background, but instead the game chooses to introduce them to you as you play via dialogue, which feels authentic to a poker experience, but ultimately falls short on how much information you will actually get. Nonetheless, the jokes are what make Poker Night at the Inventory a fun experience more than anything else, but unfortunately the amount of dialogue doesn't go on forever, and one or two hours in, the game will run out of new dialogue and start repeating itself over and over again.Rating: 6.5GameplayThere's no surprise or twist in here, what you actually play is poker, Texas Hold'em to be more specific, and that is another big reason why this game will become boring within a few hours; Texas Hold'em is the only thing you can play, and while it does work flawlessly and the game nails its table presentation, you will always play the same game, at the same location against the same adversaries, which does become boring quite easily. What will keep you playing, are the special items that each character will bring to the table as buy-in after a few rounds, giving you the opportunity to win them if you eliminate that character from the tournament; each character has one of those, making it four in total and winning those items will unlock them in Team Fortress 2, which is a nice thing if you play Team Fortress 2 as well. Even with that in mind, you can easily win those by playing a few tournaments which shouldn't take more than a few hours, and after that poker is the only thing that can bring you back, but then again, if poker is what you're here for, there are much better poker games out there. There are two difficulty levels, Normal which is the casual way to play Poker Night, allowing even the players who haven't played poker before to stand a chance by following the tutorial, and Hard which is the way to play if you really want an authentic poker experience, as the AI will become more aggressive, start bluffing and generally play smarter. The lack of additional popular poker modes such as Omaha Hold'em or Pineapple is what makes this game become boring so easily, as even with all the work put into making Texas Hold'em feel authentic, it's still the same game over and over again.Rating: 5GraphicsPoker Night at the Inventory isn't a visual masterpiece, but it holds on among other titles of its generation, and what really matters the most, the characters look amazing and authentic to their universe, while still fitting well in the Inventory's background. The animations are okay, but they do become repetitive as well after a while, and the visual effects, while kept to a moderate volume stand out well in the environment.Rating: 6.5AudioThe dialogue is what matters the most in this game, and the best part about it is that all the original voice actors for those characters are here to voice them in Poker Night, with Gary Schwartz voicing the Heavy, Matt Chapman voicing Strong Bad, William Kasten providing the voice for Max and Andrew Chaikin voicing Tycho Brahe. The soundtrack fits the mood of the Inventory perfectly and the sound effects for card flips and chips movements feel authentic, making your poker experience enjoyable, even when the dialogue starts repeating itself.Rating: 7.5ExtrasIt doesn't take more than a few hours to win all four Team Fortress 2 unlockables, which is probably where most players will end their business in Poker Night at the Inventory, but if you do decide to stay for a little longer, there are a few aesthetic unlockables such as new tables or decks, but apart from that, there is nothing else to see or do.Rating: 6VerdictPoker Night at the Inventory is a fun thing to play for a few hours, which is more than enough considering its price; if you're a fan of one or multiple characters featured in this game, you'll have a great time hearing their dialogue, but if you're here for a lasting poker experience, there are probably better options out there.Rating Overall: 6.3Check out the full review and a lot more about Poker Night at the Inventory at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=359 "

												Over time the funny dialogue will start to lose its charm as it repeats, but you can limit it or turn it off completely after you've heard all there is to hear over the course of a few hours. It'd be easy to feel disappointed, or cheated by how short a time it takes to hear all the jokes, but the reality is that this is a small, five dollar download. It comes with all the polish I'd expect from Telltale, and while it only features Texas Hold 'em, is a really entertaining way to kill some time, especially if you want those TF2 unlocks. It may not be the best poker game out there, but it is definitely the funniest. And, as most people will tell you, a little humor goes a long way. "

												The game Poker Night 2 is a quirky humor based poker game where you can play texas or omaha hold 'em. The game is simplistic and incredibly fun. The whole thing starts out with a basic intro to poker familiarizing you with all the different hands and basic winning strategies. While most play these games for the acheivement items you'll find yourself so unintentionally sucked in by it's charm that items will come without effort. The game RARELY has issues and the issues I'm talking about are things like an important flop being dealt that will skip some dialougue but the game tries to keep things like that at a minimum. All in all poker night 2 is a hallarious game that is without a doubt worth the 5 bucks it costs. BUY THIS GAME			"

												This series of Poker games,  are truly excellent little poker training gems. Regardless if you buy this one or the sequel, Poker Night 2, they are totally worth it. Often they are on special, so wait for those, but when they are grab them.They serve the purpose of brushing you up on your poker game. No stress, and teaches you a lot if you can control your desire to ""all-in"" all the time :) The added fun is that you play against popular culture icons, who chat away with each other with funny anecdotes, but also have their own personal way of playing poker and poker talk.The only downside is the reptitive looping of the anecdotal conversations. While there is a option to turn down the frequency of the anecdotes or even turn them off, there should rather be a option to turn off ""repetition"", such that once the library of anecdotes have been exhausted they stop telling stories...infact i'd buy DLC packs for more conversational anecdotes if they'd ever think of that.still, a very enyable way to learn poker or simply brush up.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is, of course, a poker game. You play poker with some famous characters, two of which are from other Telltale games. I originally played this just to get the Team Fortress 2 items you can get from unlocking achievements in this game, but I enjoyed the dialogue between the characters so much that I continued to play even after I got them all. The dialogue will eventually repeat itself, but luckily if you get sick of it you can control how much the characters talk. If you like poker and enjoy the characters featured in this game, then give a shot.			"

												It's okay.  It doesn't take long for the dialog to get repetitive (though there is quite a lot of it, it doesn't take long to play a lot of hands).  As other reviews have noted, the players have patterns that come clear quickly, and their betting habits are unreasonable... raising triple the minimum bet with very little chance of getting better than a Queen high.  It kind of becomes unfun because some of the patterns seem to be trying to give you wins.As a TF2 player, but not a fan of the other franchises, I would have liked this more if it had been all TF2 characters.  It's interesting to see the Heavy while playing a card game.Honestly, I got it for the TF2 unlocks.  It's a fun game, but none of the AI seems very competitive, and the play becomes a bit dully repetitive about the time the dialog becomes repetitive.It's fun to play for awhile and worth it if you catch it on sale for less than $5.

												The game Poker Night 2 is a quirky humor based poker game where you can play texas or omaha hold 'em. The game is simplistic and incredibly fun. The whole thing starts out with a basic intro to poker familiarizing you with all the different hands and basic winning strategies. While most play these games for the acheivement items you'll find yourself so unintentionally sucked in by it's charm that items will come without effort. The game RARELY has issues and the issues I'm talking about are things like an important flop being dealt that will skip some dialougue but the game tries to keep things like that at a minimum. All in all poker night 2 is a hallarious game that is without a doubt worth the 5 bucks it costs. BUY THIS GAME			"

The type of poker is Texas Holdemup *sorry if i misspell*. anyways, it includes four unique characters from different games. Heavy Weapons Guy, or Heavy is from the game, Team Fortress 2. Max, is from the game series, Sam and Max. The rest, I don't know. Plus, you get IN GAME ITEMS!. Heavy, gives you the Iron Curtain, a minigun, Sam gives you a pistol for Scout and Engie, and a police badge. Tycho gives you a Spy watch, and Strongbad gives you Demoman glasses. "

												Friend Simulator, err I mean Poker Night at the inventory is a game which offers the unique experience of sitting around a table and enjoying a game of texas hold em. It is relatively straightforward to play and serves as a decent poker simulator. Albeit it is a single player experience you will feel like you have friends in the cast of characters, as they bring their unique personalities to the table through playful dialogue. The dialogue is well done and entertaining to listen to although for individuals who intend to play a couple hours at a time, there is some repetition. Additionally this game offers easy to acquire team fortress 2 item unlocks as an added incentive, not that you should require it. This game gets a full recommendation from me, and is defnitely something worth picking up.			"

												Warning: if you're here to buy the game just for the TF2 items but you have no idea how to play Texas-Hold-Em, you're not going to have any fun with this. With that aside, PNATI is relatively a fun, (sometimes unfair) take on Texas Hold Em. You play cards against the Heavy from TF2, Tycho from Penny Arcade, Max from the Sam & Max series and Strong Bad from the online series Homestar Runner. The dialogue and conversations that the characters have is quite interesting and funny, and the actual gameplay itself stays true to the original rules of Texas-Hold-Em. The only problem I've seen so far is that the A.I. is a crapshoot and will sometimes unfairly beat you even when you think you have the best hand possible. With that said, with a basic understanding of how the A.I. works and of course, the rules of Texas Hold Em, the game becomes easy, perhaps a little TOO easy. The weapons and items themselves are quite unique-looking, despite only being reskins of the stock items. Overall, I'd say it's alright at the most, but there's not a lot of replay value to be had, and if you're just getting into it, I reccommend you do your research beforehand to see how to play it.

												Hey, I learned how to play Texas Hold'em!Nicely presented card game, with added nerd appeal if you recognise the characters.The table banter between the characters is fun, and when it starts to get repetitive, you can switch the banter to three other conversation options!You supposedly get TF2 items by owning and playing this, but I wouldn't know, I haven't played TF2 in years and although I won all the in-game items, nothing new showed up in my inventory.If you are looking a fun time sink, then Poker Night might just be it.

												As a poker game, well... it's a poker game, there isn't much to say about that aspect of it, sometimes, the characters will kinda tell you when they're bluffing or have a great hand and that you should fold but that's about it.However, this is made by Telltale Games so that changes things considerably.It's very interesting to get characters from games that are so different and sit them together to have a conversation.It is both funny and interesting.I don't like poker but this... I am willing to play through it all the time it takes just to hear everything these guys have to say. 8/10			"

												First of All, Great Game. I used to play poker when I was little because I loved playing cards. Im very impressed on the game in general. They had humorous conversations and were quite challenging, although Tycho sometimes creeped me out with his stare. What I really loved, was they had Strong Bad From homestarrunner.com (They are reviving soon). Because Strong Bad had all these crazy things they've done with Homestar and his friends. It brought back memories on the site. Most people played it because of the achievements and items they can get on TF2. But I played it because of more than just that. I love poker, The characters, the conversations, the challenges, and everything else you can think up. Reccomended. I hope you enjoy the game and its features as much as I did.			"

												Internet comedian Doug Walker wryly noted that people eat up crossovers like candy. It's true. Some of my favorite movies are the grand world-building events where companies worked out a way to share profits, resulting in the magic of vastly different characters coming together. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is perhaps the best example of this. More recently, there was Wreck-it Ralph, a charming CG film from Disney that showed us the secret lives of video game heroes and villains and what they do when they're off the clock. It's this simple idea that gave us Poker Night At the Inventory, and the results are pretty hysterical.As a poker game, it's fairly straightforward stuff. Make your bet, call their bluff, walk away with the pot, and so on. The real draw of this title is the banter between your opponents. Telltale Games give us Max of Sam and Max, Strong Bad from homestarrunner.com, Heavy Weapons Guy of Team Fortress 2 fame, and Tycho, the cynical webcomic star from Penny Arcade. There's hours of dialogue crammed into the game, all of it cleverly written to develop natural relationships between these unlikely poker buddies. Most of it is truly hilarious, and you get to hear something new almost every game. As a fan of homestarrunner.com, I've always loved Strong Bad and lamented the site's long-defunct status, so merely hearing new material from the be-gloved email maestro was a real treat. There are multiple unlocks available, notably the Team Fortress 2 items that you receive when you successfully knock out one of the other players. In addition, there are several themed decks and tables that can change the look of the game in minor and major ways. All this coupled with the fairly difficult achievement set (some of them relying on pure card-dropping luck) give Poker Night a lot of replay value.There are some cons of course. The most glaring one is the repetition. After a few hours of play, you'll hear the same conversations over more than a couple times. You can right-click to skip previously heard dialogue, or adjust the gameplay settings to make the characters less chatty. Other reviewers have complained that the mechanics are exceptionally poor for a poker game, but I disagree. However, I suck at playing poker, so my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. Still, I think that the players' styles fit their personalities quite well. Max is clueless, but he's dangerous as a wild card. Strong Bad isn't a good player, but he thinks he is, often bluffing his behind off and trash talking the rest of the table. Heavy is a decent cards man, but his pride can put him at a disadvantage, as he can feel that a big bet or raise is challenging his manhood. And Tycho, as a character who actually plays a lot of games himself, is the keenest of the bunch, rarely going in for high-risk pots. Poker Night features lots of fun cameos from other Telltale and Homestar Runner characters, most of them quickly glimpsed in the opening cinematic. The music completes the setting, with a lot of remixed versions of themes from the games represented, including Sam and Max and Team Fortress 2.Bottom line, Poker Night At the Inventory is a game made by geeks for geeks. You may enjoy it just fine as an oddball card game, but if you're familiar with the various franchises involved and get a kick out of the idea of Strong Bad getting upset over being called a tiny Heavy, then this is well worth the $4.99.

 Poker Night at the Inventory  review Overview Poker Night at the Inventory  is more than just a poker game. It is a learning tool for Texas Hold 'Em, a good learning tool in this matter. The first  time playing you will be shown a tutorial explaining what Texas Hold 'Em is about and how to get it going. It's not the clearest tutorial, though, such as it doesn't really tell you what an ""Ace High"" is or even what it beats, it just scratches Texas Hold 'Em and how it differs from other Poker games. Moving from the educational side of things, the actual gameplay. The dialogue is hilarious and very well written and doesn't differ from character lore. If anything it gives to lore.  Such as Max talks about his scandals to get money, or the Heavy talks about his past education.  The characters feel alive and full of actual emotion instead of just being the background due to this, I found myself actually not skipping the dialogue because I was genuinely intrigued about what they had to say. Sometimes they will even mock you for, lets say, going All In, or Folding the round in means of persuasion to change your mind on the topic. General Gameplay Very fun, difficult and very strangely, not that repetitive. You would think that playing the same goal over and over again would get very boring very quickly. But no, surprisingly enough it actually just feels like a different game every time. Every game is fully randomized and the outcome can differ based on only a few choices. You will often find a single bot who dominates the match, who then just gets crushed by a single wrong decision. The same will happen to you. Thinking that your current deck of a 9 and an Ace are unbeatable. But then Max pulls out an Ace High during a showdown. Luckily enough you're not betting real money, otherwise that one loss could make you lose a few thousand dollars. Meanwhile other times you will pull out a Three of a Kind on The Heavy, who has a Double. In that case you will see a very sad character, who just lost his earnings. Progression Poker Night is known for having items that you can achieve through achievements, both Poker Night 1 and 2. There's also in-game Poker tables and some others. These are the main source of progression post-match. But during match the progression is who has the most cash on hand. You will see this fluctuate significantly during the match, such as from the Heavy winning and nearly make everyone drop out of the match, to himself being the first to drop out. In other, more quiet matches, these numbers will only change by a few hundred every turn, this is the more common type of match you will experience.  Pros and Cons Pros:TutorialUnlocksAmazing dialogueGives  more lorePretty cheapWill keep you interestedYou could learn PokerCons:Tutorial isn't the best Finale Poker Night at the Inventory is a pretty good representation of a comedic group of friends playing Poker. I'm giving it a solid 8.8 - the only downsides aren't that large, certainly worth a store page visit if you want to play against in-game characters and challenge them to a Poker match.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a pretty good play on Poker. You play Texas Hold ‘Em Poker with some of Telltale’s characters, those being Strong Bad (Home Star Runner), The Heavy (Team Fortress) Max (Sam and Max) and lastly, Tycho from Penny Arcade.  It’s fun to play even if you’re not familiar with the characters. You can change the amount of “gabbing” they do and the amount of  swearing as well, which helps if you’re there just to play poker and grab some ‘chievements. The UI is pretty nice, and it’s very clean and easy to adjust to. It’s easy to get into it, and if you spam that right click enough you’ll get the NPCs to shut up. The only downside to this game is that although it is advertised as playable with Mac, it is not. I’ve posted on the forums regarding this issue and no response. It would seem as if the developers have no intention of fixing this bug which is a bummer because this would be fun to play on my Facebook machine as well. There is no multiplayer, so you’ll be playing foreveralone style with some chatty NPCS. Wonderful take on poker, bummer they don’t seem interested in fixing the Mac bug, otherwise, totes worth the 5 bucks. 7/10			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a pretty good play on Poker. You play Texas Hold ‘Em Poker with some of Telltale’s characters, those being Strong Bad (Home Star Runner), The Heavy (Team Fortress) Max (Sam and Max) and lastly, Tycho from Penny Arcade.  It’s fun to play even if you’re not familiar with the characters. You can change the amount of “gabbing” they do and the amount of  swearing as well, which helps if you’re there just to play poker and grab some ‘chievements. The UI is pretty nice, and it’s very clean and easy to adjust to. It’s easy to get into it, and if you spam that right click enough you’ll get the NPCs to shut up. The only downside to this game is that although it is advertised as playable with Mac, it is not. I’ve posted on the forums regarding this issue and no response. It would seem as if the developers have no intention of fixing this bug which is a bummer because this would be fun to play on my Facebook machine as well. There is no multiplayer, so you’ll be playing foreveralone style with some chatty NPCS. Wonderful take on poker, bummer they don’t seem interested in fixing the Mac bug, otherwise, totes worth the 5 bucks. 7/10			"

Short version: 81%Poker Night is a decent poker game with mediocre AI and a bunch of memorable characters whose banter will keep you entertained for a few hours. Still, if you can, skip it and play the even better sequel.Long version:What can one say about a poker game? The computer deals you cards, and you try to win against a set of pre-determined AI players, that’s it.As for the skill of the opponents, it’s standard. They don’t cheat, but usually play the check/fold/all in game, making it a bit hard to play against them intelligently; bullying is almost always the best tactic. They aren’t terrible, but you can always tell you are playing against bots.So, why is this game better than any other poker game? Because of the writing: your opponents are characters from video games (and a comic strip that deals with video games), and they constantly interact with each other in well-written, humorous banter. There are hundreds, if not thousands of lines of dialogue, so it’s hard to get bored.Still, there is one reason I wouldn’t wholeheartedly recommend this game, one large disadvantage it cannot overcome: a sequel that is superior in every aspect.

												I really disliked this game. Being a (former) avid poker fan in real life, I found terrible AI in this game to actually be offensive. It was like playing against a bunch of people who just randomly slap their money into the pot. AI has a 3 and a 10 offsuit? Great, let's throw 3000 into that 200 pot! Even if bluffing, that's ridiculous play. You're not playing poker here... you're rolling the dice to see who wins. There's really no reason to not just sit back, wait for a great hand, and then hope your AI opponents decide to throw all their money at your down aces with their 2-7 offsuit. The game also doesn't seem to fully understand the rules of hold'em and has some incorrect rules when it comes to things like bet size. A very frustrating game if you're playing for the actual poker.But, that's only half the game. The other half is listening to your favorite characters sit around a poker table and chat with each other. It can be mildly amusing at times, but quickly becomes repetitive, and the poor, slow-paced poker gameplay makes getting through those conversations a slog.			"

												I never played card games before I played this game. Now, I love it. Not only does it teach you how to play Poker in the crash-course-iest way possible, but you can have the wonderful experience of being clueless at the poker table for the first 15 games and nobody will judge you. Of course, you'll still have a negative total earnings amount to make up for if you want that achievement, but most people only get this game for the TF2 items anyways.The characters are really unique and a great selection from both pop culture, and what people loved about Telltale back then. Thank you Telltale for putting an item from my favourite flash cartoon into TF2. The best thing about them is that you can make them never talk again if you just want to play the game normally, without the occasionally repeating lines that the characters say. The atmosphere and sound effects compliment the game nicely, and there's plenty of unlockable decks and tables to encourage you to keep the game installed. It's really not a bad experience besides the TF2 items. Far better than Telltale's earlier attempt at making a poker game.			"

												If there was an ""unsure/maybe"" option for a rating, I would give this game that.Poker Night at the Inventory is unforgiving if you're new to Texas Hold 'Em poker, but can be manipulated if you're patient and lucky enough. A tutorial or guide of sorts in the game itself would help out tremendously, and having a switchable difficulty from the get-go would really help (There's a difficulty setting in the menu technically, but it's set to Normal by default and can't be changed.) Every character has their own play style, and range from daft to impeccible.-Max is fairly reckless with his bets and doesn't seem t have a grasp on when to fold. He's the easiest to eliminate for this reason,-Strong Bad knows a good hand when he has one but is so absorbed in himself that he doesn't take the others' behavior into account.-The Heavy takes into account every action taken by the other players when making his choices. If he goes all-in, you're up ♥♥♥♥ creek without a paddle.-Tycho seems to have 2 modes: Fold at the start, or keep raising the stakes throughout.Like I said, Poker Night is unforgiving if you're new to Poker. You may get some good, lucky hands when you first start playing but within an hour or so that luck will be gone, and you start getting crappier hands (or possibly, the opponents get better ones.)There's an exploit to get around this however; If you go All-in at the very beginning of a hand, 9 times out of 10 everyone else will fold and you'll win the pot atuomatically. Do this enough times and with enough luck and you can eliminate everybody without actually playing.The game also seems to have performance issues, as framerates are relatively unstable (though still within 18FPS at the very least and 30 at most) on a moderately fast system with a 1366x768 screen and the graphics set to preset number 4.Overall, Poker Night is a fine game, but if you're new to Hold 'Em then you're in for a hell of a ride.

												I bought this game as it is advertised as compatible with Mac and I loved Poker Night 2. After purchasing, I had a very difficult time getting the game to start and when I finally did, it kept crashing after the tutorial. Upon further research, I found out that the game only works on older Mac operating systems and this is a known error. TellTale should make this better known on the page. I am sure it is a fun game, but unfortunately I cannot play it and I have requested a refund.			"

												I never played card games before I played this game. Now, I love it. Not only does it teach you how to play Poker in the crash-course-iest way possible, but you can have the wonderful experience of being clueless at the poker table for the first 15 games and nobody will judge you. Of course, you'll still have a negative total earnings amount to make up for if you want that achievement, but most people only get this game for the TF2 items anyways.The characters are really unique and a great selection from both pop culture, and what people loved about Telltale back then. Thank you Telltale for putting an item from my favourite flash cartoon into TF2. The best thing about them is that you can make them never talk again if you just want to play the game normally, without the occasionally repeating lines that the characters say. The atmosphere and sound effects compliment the game nicely, and there's plenty of unlockable decks and tables to encourage you to keep the game installed. It's really not a bad experience besides the TF2 items. Far better than Telltale's earlier attempt at making a poker game.			"

												It's Texas hold 'em poker with all that crazy crossover appeal and a bunch of humorous dialogue. It also has unloackable Team Fortress 2 items, which is possibly the only reason some people might play this game. Some extra incentive, but it is a good game in its own right, listening to the funny conversations and honing your poker skills. Beware though: Tycho is kind of a ♥♥♥♥. Multiple difficulty levels is a particularly useful feature for a game like this, since people like me aren't too familiar with poker. There's also 4 different settings for the conversations the NPCs have, in case the voice clips get old. For $5, I found this game very much worth it, especially since my TF2 scout is never not equipped with the Lugermorph. It may function the exact same way as the default pistol, but some novelties are priceless.			"

												A fun poker game that's only £5.00. C'mon just buy it. Half the fun of this game is the idle chit-chat, Like Tycho and the Heavy having a menacing suspision of each other and the Heavy claiming he's an enemy because of his blue sweater. The items you unlock are great too, for example you get one of the only reskins for the invisi-watch, which I might add, looks awesome, and the only reskin for the Heavies minigun. I especially like how you actually have to earn the items to unlock them instead of receiving them on buying the game. All together a fun game that I find myself going back to all the time. 395 bananas out of 420 bottles of freeway cola.			"

												I tend to enjoy a good poker game and that is what I recieved when I bought this. The various banter of max, strongbad and the heavy will keep you entertained as well as their varying play styles. Although I have to admit why is Tycho here? He's the only character I'm not familar with and his comments are rather annoying. An example: ""It's like you were on a pvp server and spoted a lvl 5 from your flying mount until you noticed he was being escorted by level 80 rogues"". I seem to be hearing this one rather often when he actually wins; I will admit some of the conversation he holds with others can be entertaing. However, for the most part; I suggest ignoring him.All in All it's a good casual Texas Hold'em poker game with unlockable tables(like TROGDOR! themed one), decks and TF2 items if you can manage to knock them out when they buy in with it. I just wish Tycho could be muted; I enjoy listening to the rest.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory does a good job of capturing the feeling of a casual night of poker with the guys.+ Fairly authentic-feeling dialogue and interactions.+ Fun characters.~ Decent gameplay implementation of poker. Adding a minor unlock system helps a little and isn't overdone. Overall not great, not bad.- Dialogue banks are limited; you'll unfortunately run into repition fairly quickly.It's the sort of game that you can sink a few hours into and then either never play again or come back to years later to repeat the same thing. Either way, you'll probably be satisfied if ""casual poker with funny dialogue from characters you probably know"" sounds like it'll interest you.			"

												Multiple Stressors Affect Bee HealthScientists and regulatory authorities agree bee health is a complex issue, and researchers are continuing to seek answers to general honey bee colony declines. While the specific cause of these colony losses remains undetermined, several studies have indicated this delicate balance may be affected by a variety of factors, including introduced pests and parasites, microbial diseases, inadequate diet, bee management practices, habitat loss, loss of genetic diversity and improper use of pesticides.Specific factors affecting bee health, include:Parasites (Varroa; tracheal mites) - Most scientists now agree that honeybee colony losses are the result of multiple causes, with no single factor being responsible. This Forbes article explores the myriad of factors contributing to honey bee losses. This Bayer brochure explores the many factors affecting honey bee health, especially the Varroa mite. Also read the Overwintering Fact Sheet.Nutrition deficiencies - Bayer's North American Bee Care Center Manager Dr. David Fischer testified before the Horticulture, Research, Biotechnology and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee to discuss research and management strategies regarding pollinator health in April 2014. Panelists agreed (archived webcast) that the two top factors impacting bee health are parasitic Varroa mites and lack of adequate nutrition and forage.Diseases (Nosema; bacteria; viruses) - Honey bees are impacted by the Nosema ceranae fungus, the American foulbrood disease, and more than 20 viruses. Weather - The weather can exacerbate other problems that honey bees face.Beekeeping practices - Research has provided new management recommendations that beekeepers have begun to adopt.Pesticides (hives; agriculture) - Some critics contend that neonicotinoids may be involved in honeybee losses; however, there has been no demonstrated effect on colony health associated with neonicotinoid-based insecticides when used according to the label. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated in 2012 that it ""is not aware of any data indicating that honey bee declines or the incidence of CCD in the U.S. is correlated with the use of pesticides in general or with the use of neonicotinoids in particular."" This Bayer fact sheet takes a close look at the data behind neonicotinoids and the role of the compound in crop protection.Genetic weakness - One effect varroa mites have in severely attacked colonies, is to cause deformities. Queen issues - This report on the National Stakeholders Conference on Honey Bee Health considers much of the research done on honey bee health and considers the impacts of nutrition and food diversity on the longevity of queens and workers among other issues.

												Multiple Stressors Affect Bee HealthScientists and regulatory authorities agree bee health is a complex issue, and researchers are continuing to seek answers to general honey bee colony declines. While the specific cause of these colony losses remains undetermined, several studies have indicated this delicate balance may be affected by a variety of factors, including introduced pests and parasites, microbial diseases, inadequate diet, bee management practices, habitat loss, loss of genetic diversity and improper use of pesticides.Specific factors affecting bee health, include:Parasites (Varroa; tracheal mites) - Most scientists now agree that honeybee colony losses are the result of multiple causes, with no single factor being responsible. This Forbes article explores the myriad of factors contributing to honey bee losses. This Bayer brochure explores the many factors affecting honey bee health, especially the Varroa mite. Also read the Overwintering Fact Sheet.Nutrition deficiencies - Bayer's North American Bee Care Center Manager Dr. David Fischer testified before the Horticulture, Research, Biotechnology and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee to discuss research and management strategies regarding pollinator health in April 2014. Panelists agreed (archived webcast) that the two top factors impacting bee health are parasitic Varroa mites and lack of adequate nutrition and forage.Diseases (Nosema; bacteria; viruses) - Honey bees are impacted by the Nosema ceranae fungus, the American foulbrood disease, and more than 20 viruses. Weather - The weather can exacerbate other problems that honey bees face.Beekeeping practices - Research has provided new management recommendations that beekeepers have begun to adopt.Pesticides (hives; agriculture) - Some critics contend that neonicotinoids may be involved in honeybee losses; however, there has been no demonstrated effect on colony health associated with neonicotinoid-based insecticides when used according to the label. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated in 2012 that it ""is not aware of any data indicating that honey bee declines or the incidence of CCD in the U.S. is correlated with the use of pesticides in general or with the use of neonicotinoids in particular."" This Bayer fact sheet takes a close look at the data behind neonicotinoids and the role of the compound in crop protection.Genetic weakness - One effect varroa mites have in severely attacked colonies, is to cause deformities. Queen issues - This report on the National Stakeholders Conference on Honey Bee Health considers much of the research done on honey bee health and considers the impacts of nutrition and food diversity on the longevity of queens and workers among other issues.

												Man, I really can't understand people who purchased this game and left a negative review just because they don't like to play poker or aren't able to unlock TF2 items.Yeah, I mainly bought this game just to get the items, but since I played texas hold'em games on iphone too, I like to play poker themed games.And that's how I played it. Forget the guides on the game which tell to the player ""Go all-in each round to confuse the AI until you get the item"" what kind of a way to play is that???The AI won't get confused and often it will call your bluff. Normal gamig difficulty is pretty easy, even if you are a beginner to poker. I just played it as it would mean to be played, a poker game, and I unlocked the items after few hours in two days, and sincerely I hoped it could last longer.If you want to purchase this game for the team fortress items, don't rush to go all-in risking to lose, take it easy and play well as you normally do, you'll get the stuff in few time!

												Poker Night at the Inventory is exactly what it says it is in the title.  Poker.  Texas Hold-em Poker specifically and that's the only style.  I'm recommending this game for the fact it's rather cheap when on sale and you get some neat TF2 items for beating certain people.  If you are an achievement completionist, you are going to have some trouble getting a Straight Flush.  The odds of that are 1:64,974.  Also, there's no online mode so you're stuck playing against the characters.  They're fun for a few hours, but after awhile you'll find yourself skipping their dialogue when it becomes repetitive.  If you like poker, check it out.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a simple game where all you have to do is play Poker (Specifically Texas Hold-'Em) against four other NPC characters from different forms of media, ranging from online comic books, to multiplayer video games. They are Tycho from the online comic-book series ""Penny Arcade"", The Heavy Weapons Guy from the multiplayer FPS ""Team Fortress 2"", Max from the gaming series ""Sam & Max"", and Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner web series: ""Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People"". The object is basically just to win the pot, like in normal Poker. However, sometimes the NPCs can buy in with items that can be used in the game ""Team Fortress 2"", and if you defeat the character who bought in with a weapon (A.K.A. knock them out), you get that item. There are four items, one for each character. They are the Iron Kurtain Mini-Gun, which comes from The Heavy, the Lugermorph Pistol, from Max, the Enthusiast's Time Piece, an invisible watch from Tycho, and The Dangeresque Too? Shades, a cosmetic item for the ""Team Fortress 2"" class Demoman, from Strong Bad. If you don't know how to play poker whatsoever, do not worry! The game very clearly explains in detail how to play Texas Hold-'Em RIGHT before you play.    WARNING!!! Do not attempt to play this game on a Mac of any OS. I am on a Mac Book Pro running OSX version 10.9.3 and every single time I play, I get through the title screen, through the instructions, and right as I'm about to play, it crashes. Every. Single.

Very frustrating and sad. Lost all unlocks, items, stats, progress. Found same complaints all the way back 6 YEARS ago, since the launch. Devs couldn't care less. Basically the moto launch and collect money. Won't continue trying to finish it as this just totally ruins anyone's mood, will ditch it until I forget about likely in a couple years if I have nothing better to do then. This sux ;-;			"

												This game, is an amazing game of Poker (Texas Hold Em' to be exact) and you get to play against Max from Sam and Max, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Heavy from Team Fortress 2, and Tycho from Penny Arcade. This game has you betting and checking 'till you're the last one standing. Also, at random times, one of the characters might not have the money to join the game, so they put items up for grabs, and if you win them, you get them in Team Fortress 2. To win the items, you just have to knock them out. Max is the only one in the game that puts up two items, that are his Lugermorph and his badge (A Licence to Maim in TF2), Strong Bad puts up he pair of shades ('Dangeresque, Too?' in TF2). They Heavy puts up Sasha (Iron Curtain in TF2), and Tycho bets in his watch (Enthusiast's Timepiece in TF2).Once you've got these items, the only other real objective is to get all the achievements, which is easy considering there is only 20 (15 without the item grabs).Overall, this game can be fun when on a plane trip, since it has character personallities, and doesn't have Multiplayer.9/10, amazing game!

												If you are looking at this game, odds are you are looking at the Team Fortress 2 items it unlocks as you progress through the game. And really, that's the main concept behind the game. That doesn't necessarily mean the game is ""bad"", just not worth replaying. Telltale does provide us with some humorous commentary from the franchises involved such as Sam & Max and Team Fortress, this keeps the game from wearing out quicker than it usually does. The poker itself is pretty unremarkable, however, but the dialogue keeps it going. As you beat your opponents and unlock items for TF2, the dialogue does lose its humor and becomes repetitive. And once you do collect the last item, there's really no reason to play again, and it seems that was Telltale was going for in this game. Unless you play TF2 (and care about cosmetic items) or are die-hard fans of the franchises, there's no reason to purchase this game. Despite this, the game is worth the price tag of $5 for the funny commentary and items you receive as you play.			"

												Pretty entertaining for a short while, but not for real poker players. The dialogue is great, but after a few hours when you've heard everything they have to say and it starts to get a bit repetetive, you're just frustrated by how slow the gameplay goes. There's no option to skip dialogue or animations, no shortcut keys for basic fold/call/all in actions, and the ui is generally pretty bad and exhausting for poker. The AI also doesn't appear to use any kind of machine learning. Gets kind of easy to game after a while.			"

												If you love Texas Hold 'em and these classic video game icons, you'll love Poker Night at the Inventory! In this game you get to enjoy the many different funny dialogue from the characters Max, Strong Bad, The Heavy, and Tycho. However, if you enjoy Poker as much as I do you'll find the dialogue will become stale after a while if you play for extended periods of time. Though how frequent the characters chat can be changed in the options. If you get Poker Night solely on the purpose of playing Texas Hold 'em I would advise against it as the difficulty is novice at best. Even the harder difficulty you'll find yourself winning quite easily if you're a somewhat seasoned player of Poker. Ultimately, if you enjoy the humor and personalities of these characters and are a novice to Poker than this game is for you. If you're somebody looking for a Poker game, then I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. 78/100			"

												Seems to be a reasonable laid-back poker game that isn't after money farming, which is relatively hard to find these days in regards to the concept of gambling. Poker Night hunts after the fun factor of card games and laces it in supporting 3D aesthetics.Summary:Pros:- Consumes a great deal of time- Non-competitive- Laid back atmosphereCons:- Singleplayer only- Dialogue is repetitive- Raising difficulty by increasing odds for participants to have a good hand on drawThrough the first hours the comments of the participants are fairly hilarious but soon they get repetitive. The game's basically good to consume time for maybe an hour of play a day but that's all. It isn't really competitive on a multiplayer perspective, because it's purely singleplayer, which yet again backs up the vision that inspired the game.The gameplay is very atmospheric and sets up the sphere of a cynically comical mob saloon as a setting. If you're looking for something non-competitive outside of playing MMOs and the likes and love card games, texas hold 'em to be precise, then this is for you.I don't like how they try to make the game harder when you get further into the game by increasing the odds of your participants having a good hand. At least, that's how it feels. Gambling really isn't a level-based thing and should never be, so it's just stupid. All participants should have equal odds.			"

Sometimes on the internet poker seems to go way too fast and odd enough I like more this slow, cool looking poker game to have some fun.As I said my only complain is the limited dialogue and lack of interacction from the player other than your poker ""choices"", but its a game and is something you should expect, but dont quote me there cause there is quiet a lot of lines and topics for each game and you will have great fun anyway.

												Okay I'm one of those idiots who didn't buy it for the TF2 stuff. And I suppose having played TF2 or Sam and Max or those other ones from which the characters have taken a break to chill out and gamble their undergarments away would have made me interested in the game. I've seen most reviewers haven't spent more than 10 hours on the game so... that says a lot. Simply put, there's about a million better games out there if you just want to play poker. The dialogue is pretty good. Very distracting for the poker which makes you fun. You get roped in by a story by Max and the next thing you know you've called about 7k with a deuce and a seven.There's something quite fun about amusing, disparately rendered characters sit down next to you at the poker table. Each with their unique mannerisms and taunts. Haven't quite paid enough attention or put in enough hours to figure out if they've got their own style of play as well.The gameplay is excrutiatingly slow. Cutscene/animations and I wish there was an option to increase the play speed or keep the animations to a low like you can select for what level of dialogue you want. Mercifully though you can skip the hand if you fold and even the whole game if you're knocked out. Though the game takes quite a while to comply probably it's already mid sequence in character animations.Aside from that there's not much else. No multiplayer, no playing taking your friends money and assets or any of the good stuff. Perhaps a couple of different styles Omaha high-low or 7 card stud would have been good additions as options, without having to do too much work. The game would be worth a bit more then, but then again I brought it to play cards and already committed a capital mistake. Leading me to brand this game Poker Night at the Purgatory.			"

												Kinda fun and of course if you play TF2 you may want to collect the items available playing this.  Otherwise, it is a rather simple poker engine and you have to deal with annoying banter with the other characters.  I'm on the fence on this one, but if you get it in a bundle, less than $1, or the otherwise awesome telltale collection, then you should get enough fun out of it.5.01 / 10			"

												It's ok as a game to play to just run in the background while doing other things, but it's extremely flawed. As a former professional online poker player, the game just isn't realistic. All of the computer AI players you face are terrible card players, not one is even close to being a challenge, even on hard. Many times they are just calling stations that play any 2 cards and will constantly call bets to the river with nothing. It's so easy to beat this without even trying, so in my eyes, the game isn't worth buying or playing unless you're looking to get the TF2 unlocked items.			"

												I've heard great things about this game. I'm sure it's a great game.I say ""I'm sure"" because I haven't actually played it. The game crashes on startup on my Mac. A quick look in the forums reveals that this isn't just my issue - for whatever reason, this game won't work on the Mac. That's irritating, but the fact that it's listed as a Mac-compatible game on Steam, even though the developers have said they aren't interested in fixing it, is what really steams my cheese.Bottom line - if you want to play this on a Mac, don't bother. It's a waste of five dollars that could go to starving kids in Africa, or a Subway Five-Dollar Footlong, or frankly anything other than a broken game without any promise of viability in the future.

												Originally when I wanted this was for the TF2 items, but since I got it and played it I didn't really care that all much for them. (Plus this was gifted.)

												The game in a nutshell is texas hold 'em poker played against 4 characters from various video games and comics. The game does have some problems though, of which the most noticeable is the low amount of dialogue the characters have. After having played the game for about 40 minutes the same lines will start repeating, which gets a bit annoying but luckily it can be skipped. The dialogue is pretty funny the first time you hear it but not on the second time and the other times after that.I often felt that the game should have progressed faster since you often have to wait for your turn while hearing the same dialogue over and over again. I might just be a bit impatient, but I would have liked the game more if it had a button to skip the AI's turns.The game is quite fun in short bursts but gets quite boring if played for too long. Unless you like poker a lot.			"

												SHORT SUMMARY: It is fun for several hours. For $5 ($2.49 during the Steam Autumn Sale) it is EASILY worth the money.LONG SUMMARY:I found this game to be easily worth the 5$ I spent. Had I waited for the Steam Autumn Sale, I could have had this game for $2.49. Fans of wanting to play fun casual Poker will probably get the most enjoyment as the characters are fun to play against and listen to their playful banter. The interface is very simple and easy to understand.The main criticism which many have pointed out is that after several hours, the dialogue gets old and repeatable. Although it is a valid criticism, I was still able to overlook this factor as I was so focussed on the game that I was able to tune it out. If players find it too difficult to tune out, there are actual audio controls that let you decide how much dialogue you want or players can flat out turned off the dialogue. Although the game could have used more dialogue, Considering that this was TTG's first attempt at a Poker game like this, I can find this shortcoming forgiveable.This is a game where the unlocks are a fun challenge. The Steam achievements are also equally fun to acquire. These both combined is what made the game really fun for me. They are both hard to acquire, but not in a unrealistic or frustrating way. It makes you want to get them all no matter how many games or hands you have to play.    Depending on how good of a Poker player you are, if this game is played on Normal, it should not take too many hours to unlock all the game features which can cut the lifespan of this game. However, I found that if I play this game on Hard difficulty, it really extended the life of this game. On Hard, I felt like I was playing against smart poker players that were able to mathematically make smart decisions while also making bluffs or even calling your bluffs. The Hard setting is the perfect difficulty fun wise.This game lacks on-line multi-player. However, knowing that I only paid $5 for this game, I definitely was not expecting that feature. To be honest, I was quite fine with this exclusion as I found this game to be more fun that way. Since this game does not use real money, human players can often not take the game serious and make ridiculous decisions.Beyond the unlocks and achievements, this game has a longer life span than people think. No 2 games are ever the same (aside from the dialogue). Overall for 5$, I got more than my money worth from this game and enjoyed playing with characters from various media genres. There is no question Tell Tale will only improve on this fun unique Poker concept.			"

												Fun little poker game, but it wears out it's welcome quickly.  After a couple games, you will have heard everything that will be said by the computer players.  Then they repeat themselves, game after game and starts to wear on you.  The game is cheap, but I wouldn't really recommend it unless you are really bored, as I was when I bought this game.			"

												I'm not a poker fan, and I never will be. I've played it for a few games now and I still don't exactly know what to do. Must be me. Despite that I still had a good time playing it. The unlockables gave me an incentive to keep playing (even though I haven't played TF2 in a long, long time). If you like poker, you'll love this. And if you don't... well, who knows ?[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory isn't an all encompassing poker game. You can only play no limit Texas Hold 'em, and you always face the same four opponents. But playing poker is only half, hell, maybe less, of Poker Night's appeal. The real reason people should go out right now and pick up developer Telltale's latest effort is for the characters. Poker Night is hilarious, featuring cleverly written banter coming from some of nerd culture's more recognizable faces. Poker Night is a Texas Hold 'em simulation with four choice characters from gaming culture. Players join Tycho of Penny Arcade fame, The Heavy from Team Fortress 2, Homestar Runner's Strong Bad, and Max from Sam and Max at a table in a secret poker club called the Inventory. After a brief introduction to the club the player is at the table with the characters, playing Hold 'em until they either beat everyone or go out. Occasionally the other characters will have no money to put up, and will offer collateral, which can be used for aesthetic reskinning of items for various TF2 classes. Winning enough hands also unlocks new tables and poker decks for use, but doesn't change the type of poker you play. You always play with the same people and everyone always starts out with $10,000. That's it. That's the entirety of what you'll experience as far as gameplay is concerned in Poker Night. If you lose, you just start another game. Over time the funny dialogue will start to lose its charm as it repeats, but you can limit it or turn it off completely after you've heard all there is to hear over the course of a few hours. It'd be easy to feel disappointed, or cheated by how short a time it takes to hear all the jokes, but the reality is that this is a small, five dollar download. It comes with all the polish I'd expect from Telltale, and while it only features Texas Hold 'em, is a really entertaining way to kill some time, especially if you want those TF2 unlocks. It may not be the best poker game out there, but it is definitely the funniest. And, as most people will tell you, a little humor goes a long way.			"

												Prepare for a different kind of poker night in a very different kind of club. In Poker Night at the Inventory, you'll deal with notable characters such as Penny Arcade's clever, cunning Tycho, Team Fortress 2's hulking Heavy, Homestar Runner's self-proclaimed ""awesome icon"" Strong Bad and the hyperkinetic ""rabbity-thing"" from Sam & Max. These characters come together in ways some never thought possible, in a setting few would have predicted. You'll experience a new style of poker, particularly when hands don't go the way of the other fiery competitors at the table ... because these players have left a trail of victims in their wake a mile long -- with heavy weapons, biting sarcasm and irony -- and when they sit down at the table for Poker Night at The Inventory, they're ready to go all in!Poker Night at The Inventory features fully voiced characters utilizing Telltale’s dynamic dialog system. All the characters will talk trash, give unique tells, and react to the game dynamically as it is being played, providing a unique experience with each round played.			"

The characters are funny, there are unlockable decks, the whole game comes together really well, and for you who buy it for the items, heres a quick step by step wayEasy Way To Get Poker ItemsStep 1: Start Game.Step 2: If there's no special item in the ante, hit ESC then hit the right arrow twice and select a new game.Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until an item is ante'd.Step 4: On the first hand, go all in no matter what hand you have.Step 5: If the person who's item is up for grabs didn't go in with your all in, keep doing all in's until you get him to play your matching hand.Step 6: If you lose at anytime during step 5, repeat up to step 5 again.Step 7: If the person with the ante'd up item plays against your all in bet in the first hand and loses, you automatically get the item without having to go 30 hands into the game only for Strongbad to pull pocket Aces out of nowhere and put on his cool face.This in no way means don't enjoy Poker Night the way you want to, this is just the fastest way to get the unlocks for those who don't want to sit through hours of poker.

												Not bad. About 10 hours of playtime, less if you just want the TF2 stuff, more if you want to unlock everything. This of course, depends on your luck, but that's what I ended up with. Dialogue is funny, graphics are okay, just pretty decent in general. With one major problem. For a poker game, they sure forgot how to play poker. Fairly often, I'll see games where there are more than four of a kind. I'll have an ace of spades, max will have an ace of spades as well, causing me to facepalm. When one makes a poker game, people would expect they know how to play poker. I've had times where I've had four of a kind, only to see Tycho has several of the same cards. Despite this major problem, the game is still pretty fun and good for the price. 8/10			"

												If you are a mac user (like me) it will never load the game. Every time I go in and restart it, it always crashes. I don't understand why it does but the developers a too lazy to fix it. I really don't want to be too mean about this but atleast give me the game when I pay for it. It's like buying a really good game that cost $2.00 (and thats a really good deal if you ask me) but when you play it you are so happy then it crashes, you restart it, nope. You re-download it, Nope. Then you try to get a refund, Nope. But I just really wanted the items for tf2 and I also wanted to play this game. All I'm asking for is an update so it can be for all versions of mac.

												Love the game as a poker game, taught me how to play poker.I jumped into this game not knowing how to play a slither of poker, I just sat down, and played and played for a couple hours, got the TF2 items, and had fun. I would play again. The characters are funny, there are unlockable decks, the whole game comes together really well, and for you who buy it for the items, heres a quick step by step wayEasy Way To Get Poker ItemsStep 1: Start Game.Step 2: If there's no special item in the ante, hit ESC then hit the right arrow twice and select a new game.Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until an item is ante'd.Step 4: On the first hand, go all in no matter what hand you have.Step 5: If the person who's item is up for grabs didn't go in with your all in, keep doing all in's until you get him to play your matching hand.Step 6: If you lose at anytime during step 5, repeat up to step 5 again.Step 7: If the person with the ante'd up item plays against your all in bet in the first hand and loses, you automatically get the item without having to go 30 hands into the game only for Strongbad to pull pocket Aces out of nowhere and put on his cool face.This in no way means don't enjoy Poker Night the way you want to, this is just the fastest way to get the unlocks for those who don't want to sit through hours of poker.

												Prepare for a different kind of poker night in a very different kind of club. In Poker Night at the Inventory, you'll deal with notable characters such as Penny Arcade's clever, cunning Tycho, Team Fortress 2's hulking Heavy, Homestar Runner's self-proclaimed ""awesome icon"" Strong Bad and the hyperkinetic ""rabbity-thing"" from Sam & Max. These characters come together in ways some never thought possible, in a setting few would have predicted. You'll experience a new style of poker, particularly when hands don't go the way of the other fiery competitors at the table ... because these players have left a trail of victims in their wake a mile long -- with heavy weapons, biting sarcasm and irony -- and when they sit down at the table for Poker Night at The Inventory, they're ready to go all in!Poker Night at The Inventory features fully voiced characters utilizing Telltale’s dynamic dialog system. All the characters will talk trash, give unique tells, and react to the game dynamically as it is being played, providing a unique experience with each round played.			"

												Have you ever wanted to play poker with a morbidly obese alcoholic, an emotional college drop out, a fu*king bunny and a red midget who brags about all the 'poontang' he gets from chicks?N-no?Well, have you ever wanted to support a developer studio that literally takes game characters and an unoriginal idea like poker, and buy a $5 game that has had literally no effort put into it?No?Well, today's your lucky day. Just like all sh*tty, overhyped games on STEAM, this one will grab your attention with ~UNTRADEABLE~ TF2 ITEMS!I really want my $2.49 back.			"

												It's very simple and fun, especially for fans of all series colliding here. Although I am terrible at poker.There are simple tells and such to the characters.Max: Bluffs and bets, don't encourage him because it's hard to tell if there's a good hand behind the chips.Strong Bad: Huge bully that only bets and raises when there is competency to it, although most likely if he has a bad hand after the flop it's more outrageous.Heavy: Competent player, but has obvious tells and is programmed to start and compete in betting wars. This goes on even if his hand is complete trash.Tycho: Demon from the Nth dimension who sits in the corner until he has a hand capable of destroying the entirety of the universe, in which case he bets more money than Las Vegas can hope to scam people out of. Most likely the second or last guy you'll face and then he'll demolish you by whittling all your cash away and then killing you with a good hand.You know, fun stuff. "

												Going to be totally honest, I just wanted a poker game to play. And this was a very nice surprise. Its not the deepest poker experience, more like playing a leisurely game with friends, and there's nothing wrong with that, in fact its very nice. This game isn't really about playing poker, its about the characters you play with. Funny, strange, and very entertain, their small talk will have your attention. But of course the table talk can't go on for ever and it eventually does end. For the price I would say you should pick this up, it's a good time.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a well-implemented poker game, where you play no limit Texas Hold 'em.Your opponents are Tycho (Penny Arcade), The Heavy (Team Fortress 2), Strong Bad (Homestar Runner) and Max (Sam and Max).Poker Night's main part are the dialogues between the characters. However, you must be familiar with the characters in order to understand many of the jokes.After a while the funny dialogue will start to lose its charm as it repeats, but you can limit it or turn it off completely after you have heard all there is to hear.You can unlock new tables and poker decks for use and also you can unlock four aesthetic items for various TF2 classes.The biggest issue with the game is that there is no multiplayer option. You always play with the same opponents and everyone always starts out with $10,000.Well it is a simple game with four well known video game superstars and gives you the chance to earn TF2 items while you are playing. For that low price you can not make a mistake with a purchase.Sound 7/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I honestly can't recommend this game.  It's not that it's a bad game, but the poker AI is just atrocious.  Here's a typical scenario:  I have pocket jacks pre-flop and I'm on the button.  First to act raises.  I re-raise.  Small blind goes all in.  Big blind goes all in.  First to raise goes all in.  I fold because in a real poker game, I'm guaranteed to be beat at this point.  They all turn over their cards: 10 4 off suit, 2 3 suited, and 8 5 off suit.  What the hell?!  This is not a realistic poker situation, even for beginners.  You would think playing people who are this reckless would be easy, but oh no!  Pretty much anytime I have a legit hand that I'm confident in, every single player will call my bets/ raises.  Consequently, the power of numbers works against me and the majority of the time the AI sucks out with a terrible hand.  And if you play tight, all that happens is that the other four players play reckless and they end up giving all of their chips to a single player who will now have a 4:1 stack lead over you.  That's pretty hard to overcome.  On the plus side, the animations are great and the conversation by the players is truly entertaining (minus Tycho, who comes across as extremely annoying).  If you're a fan of any of the characters/ franchises included in this game, I would recommend picking this up as that part is rather entertaining.  If you're looking for a good solid poker game however, I would avoid this as the AI is simply terrible and you will spend most of your time frustrated by it.  I would give this a 5.5/10.			"

												If you are buying this game with the intent of playing poker, don't bother. The AI is laughable, and not challenging in the slightest once you've learned how the bots think. The voice acting is decent, although the continuous dialog gets obnoxious quickly. On the bright side, the achievements are all relatively easy to unlock, with the exception of straight flush and four of a kind.. which are just luck based. If you're interested in this game soley for the tf2 items, it may still be worth the purchase. Just view it as paying a dollar an item or so, and if that's still worth it to you, then have at it. I'd say it's best viewed as buying an items dlc for team fotress two, rather than a game purchase - you'll be less likely to end up disappointed in that case.			"

												First I'll ask a question: Who the hell still plays this game?The hype from TF2 unlockable items has ended, and therefore nobody plays Poker Night anymore. Poker Night at the Inventory is a largely failed attempt at having a game surviving soley on writing and humor. Failed because of their choice of crossover NPC's to play against, be it either Strongbad's narcissistic napolean complex or Tycho's sarcastic condescending passive-aggressive attitude. Nothing good can be said about gameplay, because it's nothing but Texas Hold-em, which you can play in real life for free. But if you REALLY want to get TF2 items from cards, then get friends together and play online or real-life poker where each of you wagers one of your hats, that would make for a more enjoyable time than listening to four wise-♥♥♥ NPC's talk smack about you.

												Poker Night is one of the best poker games out there ( as many as there are ). So the basics are youre at the inventory and you have a friendly match of poker with the familiar faces like the Heavy from team fortress 2, Tycho from Penny arcade, Strong bad and Max . There only one mode Texas hold em and its still okay. With the really nice looking style and the awesome poker mechanics and the items for TF2 hounds its a match made in heaven if you have the spare money this is well worth the buy I give it a 7/10			"

My first time playing this, I had no clue what I was doing, but has I went on, things started to seem more clear, and it being an exciting adventure, where everyone can win or lose, depending on your cards and your skills as a bluffer. The characters are great and bring added flavour to the game's uniqueness. A really good poker experience.7.7/10			"

I've had several laughs, actually been absorbed into it, and willing to play more even if I'm the first to lose (the more you win, the more you unlock, such as TF2 items, decks, and the poker table itself). For a little 5 dollar game, it's a great past-time. I recommend this!			"

												You may be saying to yourself, ""WELL GEE KILLZ OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE RECOMMENDING THIS FOR THE TF2 ITEMS,"" put your rant on hold. Yes the final straw for this game was the TF2 items because I didn't know the rules of poker and how to play. I myself personally love both the Heavy and Max (the bunny from Sam & Max) so I had this game on thought for a while. I honestly can say that even after getting the TF2 unlocks, I can't stop playing this game. The dialogue is not only pure gold, but the music of the Inventory is outstanding and really sets the atmosphere for this game. Telltale didn't just mess around by putting 4 characters together you can play poker with, they actually put strong and believable dialogue that actually makes you feel like you are playing poker with this strange set of people instead of just characters in a video game. It's clever, it's hysterical, and it's $5. Texas Hold 'Em is really easy to learn and you'll have a great time learning the game.			"

Witty dialogue with various game related innuendo, chilled-out ambient tunes, good looking graphics that nicely blends together the four different characters original graphic style. AI engine seems incapable of bluffing & can sometimes just be out bet, other times they seem to play with a silly hand - yet still kinda feels like NL Texas hold 'em. Good fun!			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun and simple Texas Hold'em simulator featuring familiar faces from various games offered on Steam.  If you like playing computer opponents in poker, this is fun and humorous.  There is no multiplayer function.  The game loses it's humor fast, and there isn't any DLC, so replay value is pretty low.  Unlike the sequel to this game, there are no DLC to win by playing this game.  Overall, it is just alright, but not spectacular.			"

Either one: You want to play poker with some video game characters (Really?) or two: you want promo items in Team Fortress 2.I got this crap for #2.Cons -The game seems.... VERY unrealistic at times, as in, 6 Aces played in a single game kind of unrealistic (This has happened).Boring. After about 30 minutes, you understand what to do. Either play like these are REAL people and bet like a real person, or you trick the bots into 'thinking' you got good cards (There ARE guides out there to 'farm' the items off the characters: go all in EVERY TIME).Poker Night is painful. The bots know exactly what your cards are, but they just play along. Their cards sometimes (4/5) have most of your cards. $5 - $10 for petty gameplay and items.The some of the items are not very good either, For instance, the Liscence to Maim looks like an upgraded Merc. Badge.Pros +TF2 Items.Fun dialogue. The characters DO have some fun chit-chat with each other. "

												Ok so firstly, if you are here for TF2 items then do not buy this game. The money isnt worth the TF2 items and when you buy the game it takes forever to get the items. Secondly, if you are looking for fun, look somewhere else, this game has low graphics and boring characters. Poker can be played on the internet for free.When you are aiming to get TF2 items in this game, you need to play poker for hours and hours and you must win in order to obtain the items. In this game, you must play poker and beat the other 4 players in order to win. There are 5 players in total: Yourself, Max, Strong Bad, The Heavy and Tycho. In order to win items you must keep playing games until you encounter someone coughing up some gear but you need to defeat that player and if anyone else defeats the player you lose the item. The items take forever to encounter and you have a low chance of winning the item. It take several hours or maybe even days to obtain them all. I have encountered items before but never received them.This game is not recommended unless you have fine skills at poker and you are desperate for these items. It is an absolute waste of money if you are trying to get the items. 4/10Chop2014			"

												This game has slowly spread throughout my body with it's cancerous nature. With a starting hand of a pair of Aces, Max will somehow come through with a flush. Not only will this happen but when Heavy puts Sasha up and you win the main pot, with Max winning the side pot (which no one knows how he even got that with the worst hand at the table) Max will be given the minigun so you have to wait another 10 games before even being able to have the opportunity to receive such a gift. If you want to get cancer and ultimately end up punching your monitor to bits, this is the game for you. Volvo, please make a better game.			"

												Definetely fun. I thought it was an online multiplayer game too (human opponents) but it's only single player against the 'bots'. If you know at least two of the game characters, it's definitely worth the money. It's just like watching a comedy, you also really feel at a poker table...the jokes are very funny anyway, but only if you know the characters' backgrounds.			"

												This poker game has no playback value, yet is good for a couple of hours whilst you listen to the character's chat. During this game, the characters may pull out an item which, if you knock them out of the game, can be used in Team Fortress 2. However, the items recieved in Team Fortress 2 are simply skins, and the items do not have any bonus stats.			"

												The game is horrible for mac users, yet Telltale won't fix the issues. The problem is the game crashes when the first game is about to start, because telltale had put the wrong files in the Mac Version, so they are basically tricking people on mac's to buy it, to then screw them and not let them play. if you're on a mac, DON'T PLAY!

												So this is possibly the most disappointing game I've ever played.  Not the worst game by any means, but very disappointing.The poker itself is slow as molasses.  After you've seen all the animations and dialogue 20 times, you really want to be able to skip through and play poker.  I mean, yanno, it's a poker game - ostensibly.Two hours and the game, which should be infinitely replayable, is boring and stale.  Terrible abuse of the IPs in this game.  Absolutely a shame.  I'm confused how this got a sequel.			"

												I finally had the itch to play this after remembering days past and the old Hoyle card games that I'd play as a child. Even with the graphics as low as it can go, this game still causes fans to whirl rather loudly.  It's also slow. I'd like to play a quick game against fun characters, not have to right click almost non-stop to skip the random comments and snips while trying to push things along. I would also agree what they say can get old really quickly.			"

TellTale has basically given the finger to Mac players, and they refuse to update the port to support Macs that are 10.8 or above. THATS ANYTHING THAT COMES AFTER MOUNTAIN LION. If you do want the Poker Night experience on a Mac, play Poker Night 2. It really sucks that we can play this edition, and I wish that they'd fix this broken game.

												Crappy AI.  Poker.  Bad optimization.  Completely impossible to play on Mac.  Did I mention poker?The only way you would ever want this is for the TF2 items.  Do you know how you get them?  You have to actually not only come across the chance of GETTING THEM TO EVEN OFFER IT, then actually BEAT them before someone else does, which is practically impossible.Don't bother.  The Iron Curtain's just a reskin anyway.EDIT: It turns out, most people can't even play this game still, and Telltale has done nothing about it.  It probably won't even work on your PC, thanks to its terrible structure.			"

												Really Cheap and fun. I heavily recomend this game because of all the great and funny stuff the characters say and do and they all interact and are preatty well done. Also you can unlock random items in TF2 with 3 different weapons (They dont have differents stats) and one misc hat. There is also some customisabales so you can get different tables such as the RED or BLU tables from TF2 and the TF2 card packs (Those arent the only ones). Even though Tycoo isnt a character from any were I still think he is really funny just like the other characters. Over all, I recomend this game to play for the laughs and for the fun of it.			"

												Okay so im going to be honest about this here i suck at poker and i dont think this has alot of real poker aspects i may be wrong but anyway i bought the game for the TF2 items mainly just the luger but i hopped into the game and found i actually sortof enjoyed it with the random chats happening between the characters and how they acted and responded to certain things made me laugh a little so it gave me a good time for a little while but then the chats and random things said between the characters got old fast so as soon as i got my items i made like a bannana and split (crappy joke...) because its fun but when things repeat over and over again you become bored fast so if this game comes on sale again for about 3 bucks go ahead and buy it if not and you dont like or arent good at poker stay away from it unless you need the TF2 weapons that bad but remember there just re-skinned defaults			"

												Poker Night isn't really about Poker as much as it is about listening to the characters talking to each other. The writing is amusing, and a real treat to fans of the origins of each hero. Although it's a perfectly acceptable Texas Hold Em game, it's not what I bought it for. If playing poker ever gets in the way of the fun, just let the game sit and the chit chat will pick up the slack!			"

												An overall decent Texas Hold'em simulator, but the real stars here are your opponents, seeming almost randomly selected based on their backgrounds: Max from the Sam & Max franchise, Strongbad of Homestar Runner, The Heavy from Team Fortress 2, and Tycho of Penny Arcade. Telltale Games has outdone themselves creating an immersive experience with these third party characters, matching their personality to a T when it comes to dialogue and interactions: Max tells stories about fighting crime with Sam, Strongbad rants and raves just like with his email videos, Heavy thinks of the chips as his 'team' and blames the Spy whenever he gets a bad hand, and Tycho makes various different tabletop, card, and video game references. They play the game exactly like you would expect them to, which is a great feat in itself considering the licensing TTG must have had to go through. Even though Poker Night 2 is on the horizon and to be released this month, the original should not be overlooked. There are still special crossover TF2 items to be unlocked, and you won't be seeing any of the original cast (aside from cameos by Max) in the sequel. Definitely worth the buy.			"

												This game is a pleasent little time waster. Something to occupy an uneventful evening where you don't want to play anything strenuous but don't want to feel numb in what you do play. Its relaxing but still can be a mental challenge, with a bit of witty humour thrown in for good measure.Now I only wish this wasn't the last hooraw for Strong Bad and most importantly Homestarrunner.com. With the exception of a Christmas special in '10 this was the last I seen or heard from the Brothers Chaps. Its truely a shame, I thought that if anything their cartoons and humour were getting BETTER!! I felt Homestar was finally starting to crawl out of Strong Bad's shadow and become something more than a dimless retard, but an excitable spaz that isn't entirely aware of where he is or what he says but still a very plucky gogetter......*SIGH*Go play this game			"

												PresentationPoker Night reveals 4 gaming characters playing a game of what seems to be Texas Hold em. all you have is 3 buttons. An easy way to play a poker video game. The characters are funny and it doesn't make it your typical boring poker game.GraphicsThe graphics are nothing you should care for this game. But the images are polished and nothing looks bad.GameplayI do not know much about how Poker games work but it seems like this kind of poker  (texas hold em) is more of a dumbed down version. Almost like a version for kids or something. But you only play by clicking 3 buttons, Fold, Call/check, Bet/Raise. And its mostly by luck. However, this makes it the simple of Poker games.Lasting AppealIts a 5 dollar game with some interesting dialogue and easy gameplay.

												Decent free poker game received free for pre-ordering another one (this game's sequel). I'm always on the lookout for poker games not involving real money, where you play A.I, rather than other humans. Other humans in freeroll games bet like idiots, see. This is well worth the price I paid for it and I've had a fun few hours with it already. A.I. is acceptable for the amount of money paid. I don't recognize the characters, though their personalies are mildly amusing.

												I tried Poker Night 1 and 2, and 1 is the more-fun game.  The personalities in 2 are a little annoying, and the gameplay isn't balanced among the players (Ash won the first 8 pots I played, usually bluffing, but he had the nuts every time he was called down).  It's a fun game for a pretty cheap price, and all of the characters have their quirks that are a lot of fun.  There is one pretty huge bug: you can't seem to min-raise pre-flop.  If everyone calls a 600 big blind and it comes to you, your min-raise button says ""$1,200 total"", but using it raises $1,200 to $1,800 total.  I'm not sure if this happens 100% of the time or just in certain conditions, but it was certainly repeatable for me.			"

Coming in at a low price, and with exclusive items for Team Fortress 2, I'd say it is definately worth it. It probably won't be quite as fun after you've gotten all of the items, but it will still be great to play every once and awhile.Overall Rating:12 out of 43, where 8 is the highest and 37 is the lowest.8.5/10			"

It's like a poker night out with your favorite characters. What really makes this game shine is the banter between the characters.

The dialog between the characters is by itself worth the price of admission. And trust me, Texas Hold 'Em poker isn't that hard to get a hang of. I'm normally not into Poker, but playing with these characters makes it fun for me. (And if you own TF2, you can earn several cosmetic items from this game.)			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory:It is a Texas hold 'em single player only game featuring: Strong Bad from Homestar Runner,  The Heavy from Team Fortress 2, Max from Sam & Max, Tycho from Penny Arcade and you.The NPC players play similar to their personalities. The Heavy is very aggressive frequently going all in with poor hands etc. Another interesting aspect the the NPC players are not of all the same skill level with players like The Heavy often being one of the first ones out and Max being one of the last two. At the beginning of a game each there is a chance one of the NPCs will bet a Team Fortress 2 item which is a nice touch and adds an incentive to continue playing the game after the first three or four games.The game attempts to draw the player in by having lots of back and forth talking between the NPC players and it does this quite well with enough dialogue to keep it from getting repetitive too quickly but after several games it will get repetitive as you start to hear the same things for the fourth and fifth times. Games also take a while to play out due to the amount of talking during the games. You can click to skip past the speaking which helps sometimes but also gets old after a while. There are options in the settings menu to prevent them from triggering speech scenes that delay play until they are complete or turn off speech completely but doing so removes the main focus of the game. If you are going for the Team Fortress 2 items it may get frustrating as winning is not enough to get them. You must be the one to knock the NPC betting their item out of the game and often none of the NPCs will bet an item resulting in some reloading if you just are only after them.Overall I found it a fun experience. The dialogue was amusing but does get repetitive. The poker play was solid and the NPCs having different play styles combined with the Team Fortress 2 items add some replayability. As of writing this the list price is $5 and at that price I felt it was worth the cost.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a comedic poker game that you enjoy together with some famous video game and comic book characters. Among them is Heavy from Team Fortress 2 and Max from Sam & Max. The game is somewhat what you would expect - A poker game. You compete in tournaments were you get the chance to win Team Fortress 2 unlockables, achievements and more. However, personally I think it lacks some depth. Sure there are funny conversations going on but they soon get repetitive and dull. Also the lack of multiplayer or even global leaderboards kind of depletes the purpose of gambling.I recommend the game because of the low price. Go get it if you enjoy poker!			"

También podés cambiar las cartas (hay barajas del TF2) y el paño de la mesa a medida que vas ganando.Tengo que resaltar de nuevo los diálogos, la verdad que se pasaron, estuve jugando todo el tiempo con una sonrisa, jaja.

												Just like TellTale's other poker game, ""TellTale Texas Hold em"" released in 2005, ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" is another bland, repitive entry in TellTale's attempt at a Poker game.The changes between ""Poker Night"" and ""TellTale Texas Hold em"" is a more interesting dialouge, table and card skins, and items for Team Fortress 2. The AI is still makes predictable choices and often, games can be won just by going all-in and forcing the AI to fold. Stick with Zynga's Texas Hold em game. At least you'll be playing against real humans, who, although at times mimic the AI in ""Poker Night,"" will still be entertaining as you wipe out their banks.			"

												A fun title I'll play every now and then. The TellTale engine is solid and the witty banter by the game characters is well scripted, but can become reptitive once you've played more than a few hours. The decks and table styles which unlock are a nice touch, which helps replayability, and you can adjust the frequency of the other players' conversation in the options menu. I recommend this for poker fans or those looking for an easy game to just take a break with. The budget price is quite fair.			"

												Honestly I just bought the game because it was on sale once for 0,99€ and I was intrigued by the TF2 items. After playing for a while I realized that the game is more that just a cash-in on in-games items. It actually has a lot of humor and you'll probably get a good laugh from the dialog between the characters, if you know them of course.The TF2 awards are actually really satisfying to win, because it isn't just handed to you for buying the game. No, you have to win it. Thus making this game really enjoyable, it feels like you're actually getting something out of it. It drives you into wanting to win a poker match and dread losing because you have to start over again.Do not worry to much about not knowing poker, I still have no idea what I'm doing. The game actually helps you to understand a thing or two neatly without forcing you trough some dumb tutorial.5€ is still an okay price, you'll probably get a lot of fun out of it even if you're just in it for the TF2 stuff.8/10			"

												Filled with absurb humour and fun poker playing at a reasonable price, Poker Night at The Inventory is a good game for anyone who is a fan of poker, Homestar Runner, Sam 'n Max, Penny Arcade or Team Fortress 2. Perhaps especially so with Team Fortress 2. The game features several interesting (if cosmetic) unlockables at less than Mann Co. Store prices, when taken all together. Combined with the fact that you're getting a free game, it's worth it to any 'hard-core' TF2 fan. Besides, you may find you enjoy the game of Texas Hold'Em on its own merits.As for me, I think the biggest factor going for the game is the humor value. The characters are lovable, the unlocks good for a giggle or two, but overall, the conversations are the most interesting aspect of this game. I sincerely hope there will be a sequel, preferably with a few more characters. (TF2 Unlocks optional, frankly.)While I am blue skying though, I wish people would buy in with collateral after you have already won it.			"

												I thought it was a cool and realistic poker simulation, all I did was go all in, and they always folded and I got a lot of money. So I went to Las Vegas and went to the best casino there, and I did the same thing. This is nothing like poker. This game ruined my life. I am currently writing this in a library on the street. I have barely any clothes, it was a miracle they let me in the library. I have no wife or children, they left me. Every day is a constant battle, where I am fighting suicide. This game is horrible, all I got from this are some virual items to use in an FPS called ""Team Fortress 2"". This game ruined my life forever.10/10Would put a gun to my mouth again.			"

												Not a lot to say here. It's poker with a decent amount of banter between the players. The playstyle of the players mostly fits their character, though I never did figure out Max's playstyle. He was also the most fun of the characters banter-wise; Tycho is just a ♥♥♥♥ and not in any amusing way, and the Heavy and Strong Bad are both really one-note characters. The best moments are them playing off each other, and that's done fairly well, but eventually there's so little new dialogue left to hear that you're mostly stuck hearing the same things over and over.As for the gameplay, it's... poker. The AI is decent. I hardly noticed a difference between normal and hard. The only other gameplay thing I could mention are the achievements, which are... mostly luck-based. I'm not interested in grinding them out, at least, and I'm not really interested in playing this any further, either.For the low price point, I'd say it's worth it for a few hours of fun and banter, and you'd probably get more out of it if you were a poker nut, which I'm definitely not, but... yeah, alright.

												We all know Texas Hold 'em. It's a game we've either seen played or played ourselves. Not that big of a deal, right? Well, toss in Tycho, the Heavy, Strong Bad and Max into the mix and the dialog between them alone is enough to justify your buying this game. Seriously, buy it.			"

												It's Poker. Texas Hold 'Em, I believe. Though really, the main attraction is the characters. If you really like Penny Arcade, or Strong Bad, or Sam and Max, or Team Fortress 2, then it's probably worth a buy.  Especially the last one, since you can score some pretty cool items for it. Unless you like poker, there isn't much replay value once you have the TF2 items and have heard all the conversations the characters have. There's unlockable table and deck skins, but you won't really care about those unless you like poker.			"

												Poker Night pits you against four arguably famous characters in a game of Texas Hold 'Em for virtual cash you don't have to pay for. Essentially, you can waste as much as you wish, as the game is centered around fun and character rather than actual high-stakes Poker.The highlight of this game is the dialogue between characters. Even if you don't know Max, Tycho, Strong Bad or Heavyweapons Guy, you'll quickly learn that each of them are mentally ill in their own fun, quirky little way.Oh, and you learn how to play Texas Hold 'Em. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. The game's really luck-based, so just know what you can do and hope for the best.Poker Night at the Inventory is $4.99 USD. In game prizes can be used in Team Fortress 2 as well. Visit the store page for more details.			"

												Fanservice Poker is a game involving three guys and a furry rabbit all sitting at a table, all from different games or from a webcomic of some sort, although some originally debutting in cartoons. How these people from other worlds collided, I will never know. Doesn't the Heavy belong to the 1950s or something? In Fanservice Poker, you get to listen to conversations by your opponents. Some will get along with eachother, or otherwise, they won't. For example, the Heavy from Hat Simulator 2 is disgusted by Tycho for him wearing blue clothing or something.Winning against some of these guys will earn you more fabulous clothing for Hat Simulator 2, including some shades that will make the Demoman look more like a rapper.Go ahead and try it I guess.

												Have you ever seen a charecter like TF2's Heavy and been like you know I want to play cards with that guy because I hadn't until I saw Poker Night. Poker Night is an enteraining card game with stakes of glory or tf2 items as they're called in the business. The biggest complaint with Poker Night is the repetitiveness of the charecters lines and while I can see that being an issue honestly it was never common enough for be to really notice. I never had the charecters say any of their lines more than once per tournament (round of play) besides check or as tycho say chdsk.			"

												This is game about the Heavy and his friend rabbit and mexican wrestler midget. There is also huge jerk white boy who is convinced he is sexy and cool but he is a real jerk and ruins the experience for everybody. Heavy decide it is good time to play poker with friends and one disliked associate, and they do. Heavy ends up winning most games, and everybody laugh except white boy who doesn't like losing. Heavy is gracious host, however, and give all earnings to charity like money for weak children with bone diseases and neural trauma caused by faulty wiring in subways and also poorly put together McDonalds toys. White boy would use his earnings for selfish stuff like new watch which he lost playing poker and also lifetime subscription to Martha Stewart because he is girly HA HA HA HA HA.It is easy to recommend game because it contains much of stuff people have come to expect from fine people over at bungie and warioware.

Once you figure out the characters and how they play, the game becomes incredibly easy. The dialogue is ammusing the first time you hear it, and then it keeps repearting and repeating. Honestly, not that great, and the sequel isn't that great either. Kind of disappointing when you consider how good a lot of the other games Telltale released are.			"

												It's hard to comment on a game like this.  It's like commenting on the Solitaire game that came with my computer but I'll try.  As far as a poker game goes, it's great.  On poker sites like PokerStars, the tables are rigged so rare hands happen more frequently than they naturally should to keep it exciting but this game as far as I can tell is legitimately random in it's card selection which I like very much.  If you know the characters then the comments during the game will crack you up but they're joy fades quickly as they will be repeating themselves by the second or third game.  If you play TF2 then you definitely will want to win the items that you can use and you'll get even more determined every time one of them slips by you.  This game was actually given to me as a gift (thanks Aserwarth) but I definitely would have spent $5 on it, but probably not much more.  Basically, if you even know Strong Bad, then eat cereal instead of going to McDonalds tonight and buy Poker Night.			"

												If you're just looking for a game that lets you practice playing poker, you could do a lot worse.But this game lets you play with some of your favourite characters from cartoons, games and comics.The game play is pretty straightforward, you choose the type of Poker you want to play, and get down to it.But if you pay attention to the characters and how they act, you can try and work out if they are bluffing, or trying to hide a good hand.Good replay value for the gameplay, but the comments from the other players can get repetitive after a while.Still, it will take a few games before you hear all the dialogue, and much of it gets a smile.

												Don't buy this game. It's called ""Poker Night"", but you don't even play poker. You play some silly card game where you're only dealt two cards. wtf. How am I supposed to get a full house or four of a kind with only two cards? I think that this is some kind of modified version of ""Go Fish"" because there are a bunch of cards laid out in the middle of the table, but they're all laid face up.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a simple concept, executed well. It takes a few well-known characters in the gaming/geek world, puts them together at a poker table, and you get to play poker with them. If you are at all familiar with Texas Hold-em poker, and don't find the game absolutely horrible, there is some fun to be had with this title. The main source of fun comes from the interactions between the different characters. If you know these characters, it makes the banter even better as you will be delighted to see their personalities are kept true to their source material. It's like playing poker with some semi-celebrities: no more, no less.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												If you like playing poker with your friends, you'll love playing poker with Strong Bad, The Heavy, Max, etc. The items for the inventory are a little redundant, but the voice acting, the options to turn on or off foul language from Tycho and adjust how much the characters talk and the poker-style gameplay are well put together by the TellTale and Valve game designers and creative team. Thanks so much to Matt Chapman for voicing Strong Bad especially. I've loved Homestar Runner since 2001. In fact, Strong Bad is the reason I purchased this game.			"

												This game has possibly the funniest writing I've seen in a while. Poker Night at the inventory bring The Heavy, Strongbad, Max, Tycho, and you into a high stakes poker game with massive amounts of witty comments, and a decent amount of unlockables. The unlockable are probably what sold this game to a lot of people, especially since each character has a TF2 usable item, but there are also in game unlocks as well. All in all worth every penny, even without the TF2 items.  I'd like to see a sequel of a different game with the same premise, and different characters. Maybe Parcheesi			"

												What's there to say about Poker Night at the Inventory?It's a fun poker game that you can just jump into whenever you want, to play with the four hilarious characters. It teaches you how to play poker casually very quickly, which is fun, though I think that an online multiplayer where you can just pick one of the four characters and play with three friends would be a very good addition to the game. The only real ""complaint"" I have with this game is that the smalltalk the characters make gets quite repetitive and boring very quickly, but that's about it.Overall, very fun if you want to play something different for once.7,5/10			"

Though i wasnt playing for fun until after i got the items since they can be hard to get if you dont have a good hand.Good:-Funny and entertaining dialogue between the characters-Free items! (that is, unless you bought this game solely for the items)-if you lose a game you can watch the rest of them finish it if you want to,and the best part? you get to see their hands!-You can unlock many tables and decks to customize your game (doesnt affect gameplay of course,but still cool.)-you get a little poker nickname after each win (or loss) depending on how much you have (or owe)Bad:- fresh dialogue seems to run out after about 2 hours and most lines repeat, though some new lines still pop up here and there.Tips:-If you are here for the items but dont want to play normal games, press Escape go to the menu and keep clicking new tournament, keep clicking it until somone doesnt throw money and throws an item in instead-if your playing a normal game try to knockout tycho first because trust me you DO NOT want to be alone at the table with tycho, he will put you through hell.Overall: Just a very fun game, especially for just 5$  "

												Fun game if you like Texas Hold 'Em poker.  You play on a 5 man table with $10,000 stakes.  Aces are high but can be used as the lowest card in a straight.It's single player.  I wish it was playable online though because the full-screen 3D poker is so much cooler than the little web-browser poker variations.If you've got $5 to spend, enjoy gambling/cards and want to unlock some TF2 items, give it a try			"

												I'mma be straight forward here: Only 2 of the main 4 characters you play Texas Hold 'Em Against I actually know of, only because of their popularity of their franchises (Sam and Max, and TF2), the other two aren't as popular or well known, so that's one flaw. Two, the item system is complete random, so it could take at least 10 minutes of you either restarting the match just for one of them to offer an item instead of money in the beginning cutscene, or try and be VERY patient and keep losing/ winning until one of them offers an item. HOWEVER, even if they do offer one, if you lose your entire hand, or they lose theirs to someone ELSE, you won't get the item. Anyways, the main flaws are: Poor random choice in a few characters, overall game mechanics, and the lack of weapons in the game that actually have use, like stat-weapons like the Spy-cicle, and the only cool item you unlock (personally in my opinion) is the Enthusiast's Timepiece. What would have made this much better, is if all characters were always random TF2 characters, with them betting items more often (since the weapons won in the games go into your TF2 file). I wouldn't really recommend it, since the only main reason why I got the game (from a trade) was because I wanted the Timepiece watch because let's be honest here, who wouldn't want a SOLID GOLD invisibility watch, that has a symbol representing video games' most iconic character of all time, PAC-MAN!? Overall, 4/10.			"

												This game in my opinion is half half meaning I would recommend it for certain people but shouldn't be recommended for others. Firstly, this game CAN NOT run on macs. Secondly, if you are not into tf2 or gambling this game is not for you because all it is for is free tf2 items like the lugermorph, iron curtain, Dangeresque, Too?, the Enthusiast's Timepiece, and the License to Maim. The reasons for why I WOULD recommend it are simply if you like playing poker sure buy it. If you enjoy tf2 and you want some ""Free items"" go ahead buy it. If you have a pc then sure go ahead and buy it! :)Forum Page (Not Runnable on Mac): https://steamcommunity.com/app/31280/discussions/0/828934913213021935/ "

												Pokr Night at the Inventory is a game about - Well, poker. You play at a place called the Inventory, Kinda like a bar for video game characters. Probably the main aesthetic to this game is that you play with four players, all from different games. Even if you (Somehow) dont know any of these people its still a great and worthwhile expirience. Fortunatly, unlike most card games out there, its not stale and boring. The characters chat and make references to their own or other peoples games, which I liked ALOT. And with quirky animations, customisation of decks, varing difficulty, trading cards and achievments - all at a low price, you'd be stupid not to pick up this title.You also get free tf2 Stuff.Basically why 90% of people buy it.Not even kidding.

												Never in my life did I see myself playing poker, mother effing poker!Whenever I spot poker, It's either a $#!@ facebook or mobile game that is so plain and mundane I want to vomit.But this game, it's special, the depth and personality of the characters are just so funny and realistic, I won't blame you if you'd ditch your real life friends for these 4 lads, who may come out rude at times, but in the end they just want to have fun (Any your money)! That's not the only pro, there was just a big telltale sale you could get this game for less than a dollar, the unique and indulging gameplay+ the promotional tf2 items. It's true many people only buy it for the unlocks, but I myself still play it even after all the promotional weapons/cosmetics, the game's just that good to leave. Plus, it's a telltale game, you should expect quality and fun for hours if not days.The only con would be the limited playtime, as the game can be a bit short and boring after haring all the dialogue and obtaining all the items. To mostly avoid this for the most part I'd suggest taking moderate breaks and trying to enjoy yourself, and not hunt for the items. Good luck, good day, and have fun!			"

												While the premise of a card game turned computer game might not make everyone jump hight out of their seats and pre-order it, the addition of a great cast, entertaining dialogue, and unlockable prizes (such as different decks and tables) along with achievement items for Team Fortress 2 makes this game worth checking out.You find yourself at a place known as the Inventory, a special speakeasy made during the prohibition for game enthusiasts who only wanted to have a drink, play a few games, and bet ridiculous amounts of money. Nowadays, the place still has it's fair share of strange patrons such as Max, Strong Bad, Heavy, and Tycho.The guest stars aren't just around for show, they keep the games interesting and will sometimes offer to buy in using special items that are handed over to whoever knocks them out of the game. These prizes are:Max: Lugermorph and License to Maim (custom pistol and police badge)Strong Bad: Dangeresque, Too? (moonviewer glasses)Heavy: Iron Curtain (custom minigun)Tycho: Enthusiast's Timepiece (custom invisiwatch)This game, while laughing and carefree in nature, will punish those who get too greedy when one of the coveted items comes into play. It make take a few tries, but the slow and cunning method will always triumph of rushing recklessly (except in Max's case, he doesn't even look at the cards).			"

												I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this game, I'll be honest. I thought that Texas Hold 'Em with Tycho, Strong Bad, Max, and the Heavy would be a little too gimmicky. Still, with the promise of TF2 items and a liking of Poker, it drew me in. Gameplay is... Well, it's Poker. Texas Hold 'Em, to be exact. If you don't know how to play, there's a tutorial available in-game, along with a handy couple of charts explaining betting and card hand heirarchy. The characters chat with each other as you play, (and you can actually determine how much they talk in the game's options menu) and as a fan of Team Fortress 2 and Penny Arcade, some of the conversations were pretty amusing to hear. I have to admit that my interest has been piqued in Sam & Max's Adventures, along with.. Whatever it is Strong Bad is from because of them.All in all, if you can get it cheap, and you like TF2 items or maybe you just like poker, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't at least give it a whirl.

												Fun when your bored, a decent poker simulation with a video game twist, only issue is the game encourages you to buy everyone drinks to get them to show hints about their cards.  While the idea is great, the actual results are not, the players give little to no increase in body language, and the few movements they do make tell litterally nothing.  This makes the game a challenge at times and is largely based on luck.  But besides that I quite enjoyed the game even though the reason I bought it was the tf2 items.  The characters have their respective personalities but as with real humans they can be quite unpredictable.  One minute you might bluff and go all in and everyone folds, then you do it again in an entirely different game and everyone goes all in too and you get completely demolished.  It's one game where the RNG system is actually fun.  7.92/10 -Scale of edgy approval			"

												certainly a straight up hold'em game. each character has a special quirk of their own and their banter is always entertaining.  Downsides are that they repeat their dialogue a lot, responses are not timed very well. and sometimes their taunts are just plain annoying.  I wish the player could embody one character instead of being a faceless player because I don't like not being able to talk back or taunt back for that matter.  I was hoping to be able to explore the Inventory since it is mentioned in the title.  It would be cool to be able to explore the place and interact with the bar, different areas, then be able to come back to play poker.  It gets a little monotonous. "

Secondly, if you are not into tf2 or gambling this game is not for you because all it is for is free tf2 items like the lugermorph, iron curtain, Dangeresque, Too?, the Enthusiast's Timepiece, and the License to Maim. The reasons for why I WOULD recommend it are simply if you like playing poker sure buy it. If you enjoy tf2 and you want some ""Free items"" go ahead buy it.

												Pokr Night at the Inventory is a game about - Well, poker. You play at a place called the Inventory, Kinda like a bar for video game characters. Probably the main aesthetic to this game is that you play with four players, all from different games. Even if you (Somehow) dont know any of these people its still a great and worthwhile expirience. Fortunatly, unlike most card games out there, its not stale and boring. The characters chat and make references to their own or other peoples games, which I liked ALOT. And with quirky animations, customisation of decks, varing difficulty, trading cards and achievments - all at a low price, you'd be stupid not to pick up this title.You also get free tf2 Stuff.Basically why 90% of people buy it.Not even kidding.

As far as texas hold-'em games go, the witty dialogue from the familiar characters makes it far more entertaining than most, and for five dollars, it's hard not to get your money's worth. The TF2 items are all cosmetic, but it doesn't make them any less satisfying to unlock.			"

												The poker is alright, but since it's all funny money, the stakes actually feel pretty low. Almost better off taking a loss on the first hand, while trying to set up for a quicker win in case the all in succeeds. Poker isn't what you're here for though. The game is worth it for the witty and crude banter offered by the different chaps you sit down with. Unfortunately, one of the folks responsible for this game being on Steam decided it would be a great idea to make getting a winning Straight Flush an achievement. Nobody saw fit to mention that it can take several thousand hands to see one flippin Straight Flush. If you're worried about completing the achievements, and the rest are far more reasonable, that one achievement or maybe the Four of a Kind will have you sitting through the dialog til you can't stand to hear the interesting-the-first-time characters one more time. You'll be less sane than the lot of em. Good luck. The poker 3/5, add in the banter 4/5.			"

The table conversations by the 4 characters is memorable and witty, plus learning poker is totally good and fun to teach kids to. (If it ever comes to it.)

												Well, there's not much to say... I mean, where can't you find a poker game available nowadays? This is just another variation, where you can get to play with some characters from different games who're always trying to make jokes about this and that. It's interesting when you play at the first time but then it gets old when they start repeating the same things over and over again. Besides that there're also some goals to achieve and if you do, you can get to unlock items to certain games, such as Team Fortress 2 (it was actually one of the biggest reasons that motivated me to purchase this title). Although there're achievements to get, unfortunately so far there aren't any trading cards available but I sure hope that they can add some in the future. Overall, if you enjoy playing poker, go for it.			"

												Fun when your bored, a decent poker simulation with a video game twist, only issue is the game encourages you to buy everyone drinks to get them to show hints about their cards.  While the idea is great, the actual results are not, the players give little to no increase in body language, and the few movements they do make tell litterally nothing.  This makes the game a challenge at times and is largely based on luck.  But besides that I quite enjoyed the game even though the reason I bought it was the tf2 items.  The characters have their respective personalities but as with real humans they can be quite unpredictable.  One minute you might bluff and go all in and everyone folds, then you do it again in an entirely different game and everyone goes all in too and you get completely demolished.  It's one game where the RNG system is actually fun.  7.92/10 -Scale of edgy approval			"

												I thought it was a cool and realistic poker simulation, all I did was go all in, and they always folded and I got a lot of money. So I went to Las Vegas and went to the best casino there, and I did the same thing. This is nothing like poker. This game ruined my life. I am currently writing this in a library on the street. I have barely any clothes, it was a miracle they let me in the library. I have no wife or children, they left me. Every day is a constant battle, where I am fighting suicide. This game is horrible, all I got from this are some virual items to use in an FPS called ""Team Fortress 2"". This game ruined my life forever.10/10Would put a gun to my mouth again.			"

												I like many others bought this game purely for the purpose of unlocking the tf2 related items that come with it but I can say that as a whole this game is not that enjoyable. The dialog between characters is interesting at first but quickly becomes stale as does the gameplay. It gets repetitive very quickly as there are only so many times the same game of poker can be enjoyable. Overall I would not recommend this game to people unless you have played games with ALL the featured main characters as the dialog is the only thing this game has going for it.			"

												Never in my life did I see myself playing poker, mother effing poker!Whenever I spot poker, It's either a $#!@ facebook or mobile game that is so plain and mundane I want to vomit.But this game, it's special, the depth and personality of the characters are just so funny and realistic, I won't blame you if you'd ditch your real life friends for these 4 lads, who may come out rude at times, but in the end they just want to have fun (Any your money)! That's not the only pro, there was just a big telltale sale you could get this game for less than a dollar, the unique and indulging gameplay+ the promotional tf2 items. It's true many people only buy it for the unlocks, but I myself still play it even after all the promotional weapons/cosmetics, the game's just that good to leave. Plus, it's a telltale game, you should expect quality and fun for hours if not days.The only con would be the limited playtime, as the game can be a bit short and boring after haring all the dialogue and obtaining all the items. To mostly avoid this for the most part I'd suggest taking moderate breaks and trying to enjoy yourself, and not hunt for the items. Good luck, good day, and have fun!			"

This game sometimes has a character spit out a TF2 item that you can get by eliminating them from the tournament. If you don't know how to play poker, look it up, there are plenty of sites for it. The game has Tycho, Heavy, Max, Strongbad, and YOU. They chat with eachother, have pretty good reactions and expresions. Be it facial or vocal. Its a great game if you don't know what to play.			"

												Such a funny game! Takes the seriousness and enjoyment of Poker and removes the stress with fun tables and cards and absolutely HILARIOUS lines. I'd recommend removing the censor, but that's just my preference... Tycho swears a **** ton. It can get a little frustrating after you lose a few games in a row or when you're trying to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ straight flush, but it's enjoyable in other ways. You don't ACTUALLY lose money! You can enjoy poker without stress! The other guys say some really funny lines! And, of course, the reason why 60% of you buy this game - the TF2 items! A police badge, a sweet pistol, some slick shades, ""Sasha"" and a bloody watch. But this game isn't just about the TF2 items. I bought it because I wanted to enjoy it, and took the items as a bonus. It is quite fun to strategise how to win the game and how to target a certain item without ****ing up, and that feeling when you get a flush, a full house or a straight and you destroy everyone else's hands, or when you win with a pair of twos. This game is so much more than $5 of TF2 items! Highly recommend!!			"

												It's a tough call this one. On one hand, it has pretty good writing and voice work that really capitalizes on the absurdity of the players. On the other hand, It's just poker. There's tells and TF2 items to incentivise you to keep going, but it never feels like more than playing poker.I'd say for five bucks, it does enough to warrant a play through. If you don't play TF2 thugh, you might be better off watching Youtube play throughs.			"

												Worked fine in Windows 8.1 with an nVidia card.3/5 stars.It does what it's supposed to, but...it's only Texas Hold'em. Playing that over and over got old real fast. And the AI seems a bit reckless, going all in with wild abandon. I can't really say I enjoyed this.			"

												The game is fun for any Texas hold em fans but also gaming fans. Pnati is a great poker game and along with the same old poker game aspects as any other game you get more like the inclusion of gaming characters such as max, the heavy,Tycho,and strongbad playing a game of poker with you and the chance of you getting a special item from each of them for tf2 but even if you don't play tf2 you can still have fun unlocking the card sets and tables along with the other items. So if you're a tf2 fan get it for the cosmetics and weps, if you're a gaming fan get it for all the characters with their own interesting and original stories they tell, if you're a poker fan get it for the game itself, if you're all of these and !maybe more than get the game!

Then, I actually sat down to play this game. It's maddeningly frustrating, and sometimes I could swear it knows the cards in each player's hand and rigs the hands to keep the items away from me.

												Poker Night was a very enjoyable experience. It is easily the best Texas Hold'em game I've ever played, as it provides a cast of humerous and interesting characters from various other games. Those unfamiliar with the customs and strategies that come with high stakes Poker may find the game difficult at times, but this is a game well worth it's asking price. The absense of any multiplayer was disapointing, and it doesn't make an appearance in it's sequel either.Those hoping to for 100% achievement unlocks in this game will be infuriated by one particular achievement requiring you to win a hand with a Straight Flush, which is a 0.0032% chance of happening with each hand. Completionists beware. :p			"

												So the game is just your basic Texas Hold 'em, but the atmosphere is the selling point. Sitting down with the 4 characters, even if you don't know much about them to begin with, while they make interesting conversation with you and each other in a relaxing locale; that's what it's all about. Nice if you want a little break from all the fast paced do-or-die games you normally play.You can choose how often the characters talk, and if you want to speed up the actual game you can right-click to skip dialogue. You also have two difficulties to choose from, and you can unlock a few table felts and decks to add some more variety.There are some downsides though; you can't change the buy-in amount, how fast the blinds change, or make any tweaks to the actual game at all, so if you're a hard-core Hold 'em player this may turn you off. There's also no option for online play, and while that's mostly to be expected, having room for one friend to join in could have improved the life of the game quite a bit.Still, you can certainly put a number of hours into this one. Myself, I was only familiar with Strong Bad, and had never played Texas Hold 'em (and don't generally like playing cards period), but I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience with it, and it's priced low enough that you don't have much to lose.

												You know a lot of people ask me. ""Chris, How do you win at online poker so you can obtain meaningless virtual items and sell them for ridiculous prices?"" To which I answer ""Go bribe that guy in the back alley to give you them."" Moments later they all had the ban hammer dropped so hard their Steam accounts were warped through several dimensions. So now I tell them to play Poker Night at the Inventory. The game features some of the internets favorite characters and with a truck load of whitty dialouge poker has never seemed so interesting. TAKE THAT LATE NIGHT POKER TOURNIES!!! Plus you get items for TF2 thats a $400,000 profit for just $5.00!			"

												DO NOT PURCHASE. I bought this game only to find that it is not supported on Macs beyond 10.8 (crashes after clicking through or dimissing the poker walkthrough screens). This nugget of information, however is buried on their forums, and only later on their Steam product page (within parentheses). Their customer service asks that you contact Steam for a refund, Steam asks that you contact the developer. Full circle-jerk and I'm left holding the bag. Caveat emptor and all, but Telltale Games has soured this customer on their company, lost any future sales from this customer, and potentially lost future sales from all those I have the opportunity to relate my experience to.

												I give this game a thumbs up with qualifiers. If you:- Are looking for cheap, single-player poker game- Have a quirky sense of humor- Enjoy Max (from the Sam & Max games)- Know who Strong Bad is and think he's a cool guy- Don't mind idle chatter, and in fact enjoy itThen this is for you. If you aren't looking for a single-player poker game, don't care about Max, Strong Bad, or for that matter the Heavy from TF2 or Tycho from Penny Arcade, then maybe give this a pass. There's always Poker Night 2, which features Brock Samson, Claptrap, a weird version of Ash from Army of Darkness, and Sam from Sam & Max. Also GLaDOS as the dealer. Personally I recommend both, but this came first. Your mileage may vary, of course. (My low play time is due to the fact that I initially played it via my wife's library, before getting it myself.)

												Poker Night at the Inventory is an unique game in my point of view. Though, it is a gambling game alright. The characters are also very unique in personality. The game is also funny in humor, jokes, and dialogues. But, what's makes this game lucrative is the earnable items from TF2 if one of the players in the game give their item. Unlockable Items From TF2:1. Dangeresque, Too? from Super Bad2. License to Maim and The Lugermorph from Max3. Iron Curtain from Heavy 4. Enthusiast's Timepiece from Tycho.With these characters in the game, it makes the whole game fun. There are 2 purposes that why people buy this game.1. To obtain the free items from the game.2. To enjoy the gameplay that was made to.I rather not uninstall this game after earning them all. So, take some time to play it regularly and experience the full Poker Night at the Inventory. 4 stars out of 5.			"

												I'll be honest, I bought this game because of the stupid Steam treasure hunt that they were doing. Add in the promise of scoring some easy TF2 items, and you have my interest. Then, I actually sat down to play this game. It's maddeningly frustrating, and sometimes I could swear it knows the cards in each player's hand and rigs the hands to keep the items away from me.

												My brother tried to explain poker to me dozens of times, yet I never was able to understand how the game is played. Nevertheless, I stepped into this game with hopes of a good tutorial. Its tutorial may not be the finest, but I guarantee that you'll learn to play poker in just 20 minutes of playing this game, not to mention how fun to play it is because of all the unlockables (tables, decks, Team Fortress 2 items...) and the character dialogue (there are four ""dialogues"" which dictate what the characters will speak, and you can also uncensor the by-default-censored funny lines).

												I bought this game because I played and loved Poker Night 2, and the thought of that game with Strong Bad in the mix was irresistable. However, this first game in the series is definitely inferior. Whereas the characters in 2 were engaging and fun to listen to, the characters in 1 are insufferable. Considering 1 and 2 are essentially the same game with different characters, I would recommend buying the 2nd one over this one. And if like me you're a big Strong Bad fan, don't be lured in by his appearance in this game like I was. You're better off just rewatching some sbemails.			"

												PresentationPoker Night reveals 4 gaming characters playing a game of what seems to be Texas Hold em. all you have is 3 buttons. An easy way to play a poker video game. The characters are funny and it doesn't make it your typical boring poker game.GraphicsThe graphics are nothing you should care for this game. But the images are polished and nothing looks bad.GameplayI do not know much about how Poker games work but it seems like this kind of poker  (texas hold em) is more of a dumbed down version. Almost like a version for kids or something. But you only play by clicking 3 buttons, Fold, Call/check, Bet/Raise. And its mostly by luck. However, this makes it the simple of Poker games.Lasting AppealIts a 5 dollar game with some interesting dialogue and easy gameplay. I recommand this for Team Fortress 2 players who are in need of new items for their collection whatsoever.  RATING : 8.3			"

												Even you're maybe one of the average gamers playing it for the Team Fortress 2 items and trying to rush as soon as possible. But, I don't find it really necessary to do so, because the carnival ride that this game gives you is very enjoyable through out the time I've played this game even for the items. Still, I download it sometimes just to play the nice joy ride it has to offer. (And the small download size too!)			"

												I would now warn all people buying all Telltale Games. This game was so much fun, and I love poker, so I bought it hoping to have a quick and fun poker game to play casually. I have a Mac, and this worked out wonderfully for a while. Then, Mac 10.8 was released, and the game would now crash right after the tutorial. TTG refuses to patch the game, and urges those seeking refunds to go to Steam to request those refunds, knowing full well that Steam would not honor these refund requests.Instead of taking responsibility, TTG passed on the blame. Before, they did not mark a ""maximum"" system requirement and continued to sell a game that did not work for their customers.Instead of just fixing the game, now the requirements on Steam read ""Not Compatible with Mac OS 10.8.x and above"". I hope you read that, because otherwise you dropped $4.99 down the proverbial toilet.I'm just waiting to see what other flaw or oversight they choose to ignore in the future. I trust them about as far and I can throw them.			"

												Forget the TF2 items for a moment, this one is all about the banter between the characters as you take their money in Texas Hold'em poker. Strong Bad is particularly great, with his stories about Videlectrix and Fists of Knuckles films, while Tycho has a weird fetish for Giraffes and Hedgehogs. Heavy's and SB's nightmares are hilarious and there's lots of fan service for all the characters. Unfortunately no multiplayer or alternative poker types, and the dialogue sometimes repeats too frequently, although there is a lot of it. Lots of card and table skins to unlock too - one turns Max into a skeleton.			"

												An overall decent Texas Hold'em simulator, but the real stars here are your opponents, seeming almost randomly selected based on their backgrounds: Max from the Sam & Max franchise, Strongbad of Homestar Runner, The Heavy from Team Fortress 2, and Tycho of Penny Arcade. Telltale Games has outdone themselves creating an immersive experience with these third party characters, matching their personality to a T when it comes to dialogue and interactions: Max tells stories about fighting crime with Sam, Strongbad rants and raves just like with his email videos, Heavy thinks of the chips as his 'team' and blames the Spy whenever he gets a bad hand, and Tycho makes various different tabletop, card, and video game references. They play the game exactly like you would expect them to, which is a great feat in itself considering the licensing TTG must have had to go through. Even though Poker Night 2 is on the horizon and to be released this month, the original should not be overlooked. There are still special crossover TF2 items to be unlocked, and you won't be seeing any of the original cast (aside from cameos by Max) in the sequel. Definitely worth the buy.			"

With the exception of a Christmas special in '10 this was the last I seen or heard from the Brothers Chaps. Its truely a shame, I thought that if anything their cartoons and humour were getting BETTER!!

												People often say the price of something reflects its quality. I find that for the most part true, I mean Steam has a lot of crappy free to play games (*cough!* Spiral Knights *cough!*) but eventually you find ones worth your time. But if you want a game that will guarantee you a bit more enjoyment, premium games probably is where you will want to go. Poker Night at the Inventory is currently the first of three non-free to play games that I own and will review. So without anything else to say, let’s go!This game has a bland plot, but it’s better than nothing. The Inventory is an illegal gambling lounge founded in 1919 Mr. Kent after a draft of the 18th Amendment. Who or what is he? We’re never told. In the opening sequence we (the guy in the game) go down an elevator into the Inventory and this short dude with an admiral’s cap (Wikipedia says it’s Reginald Van Winslow, former captain of the Screaming Narwhal)comes recognizes us a noob. He leads us downstairs to a poker table. Playing is Heavy Weapons Guy from Team Fortress 2, Tycho from Penny Arcade comics, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner and Max from the Sam & Max games. The four let you into their game of no-limit Texas Hold ‘Em with stakes of $10, 000. Since no one seems to care that they are betting 10 grand, the game starts!Now into the game play. And...Its poker, what more is there to be said? Maybe the fact that during play characters will out of nowhere break into conversations and that are hilarious! The Heavy talking about TF2 game play and Max’s nonstop references to detective games in an innocent way. The more you go into the game, the more stuff you will unlock. There are minor differences like the cards and table icons changing to getting weapons for Team Fortress 2. At the beginning of some rounds, one of the characters will be broke and will put in a weapon to pay their fee. Knock them out and you will get their weapon. The Heavy has the Iron Curtain (minigun), Max has the Crimestopper Combo (Lugermorph – pistol and Licence to Maim - cosmetic), Strong Bad has the Dangeresque, Too? (cosmetic) and Tycho has the Enthusiast’s timepiece. After unlocking them, they will be yours to use in TF2.Aesthetically speaking, this game is not bad in terms of visuals. There are no glaring visual problems, but Steam has a lot prettier games. The music is all right, but not catchy.Poker Night at the Inventory is a good time in action, but is it for everyone? No. This game should be good for fans of Team Fortress 2, since playing will eventually have you starting to unlock new stuff. But for the 100 of you that don’t have Team Fortress 2, This is just another poker simulator. If you don’t care about the fancy stuff and just want to play Texas Hold ‘Em, find a poker game somewhere else because Poker Night at the Inventory simply won’t cater to you.My final verdict is that this game is great for its price, but for people seeking a proper poker simulator, there’s nothing to see here.

												I give this game a thumbs up with qualifiers. If you:- Are looking for cheap, single-player poker game- Have a quirky sense of humor- Enjoy Max (from the Sam & Max games)- Know who Strong Bad is and think he's a cool guy- Don't mind idle chatter, and in fact enjoy itThen this is for you. If you aren't looking for a single-player poker game, don't care about Max, Strong Bad, or for that matter the Heavy from TF2 or Tycho from Penny Arcade, then maybe give this a pass. There's always Poker Night 2, which features Brock Samson, Claptrap, a weird version of Ash from Army of Darkness, and Sam from Sam & Max. Also GLaDOS as the dealer. Personally I recommend both, but this came first. Your mileage may vary, of course. (My low play time is due to the fact that I initially played it via my wife's library, before getting it myself.)

												Such a funny game! Takes the seriousness and enjoyment of Poker and removes the stress with fun tables and cards and absolutely HILARIOUS lines. I'd recommend removing the censor, but that's just my preference... Tycho swears a **** ton. It can get a little frustrating after you lose a few games in a row or when you're trying to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ straight flush, but it's enjoyable in other ways. You don't ACTUALLY lose money! You can enjoy poker without stress! The other guys say some really funny lines! And, of course, the reason why 60% of you buy this game - the TF2 items! A police badge, a sweet pistol, some slick shades, ""Sasha"" and a bloody watch. But this game isn't just about the TF2 items. I bought it because I wanted to enjoy it, and took the items as a bonus. It is quite fun to strategise how to win the game and how to target a certain item without ****ing up, and that feeling when you get a flush, a full house or a straight and you destroy everyone else's hands, or when you win with a pair of twos. This game is so much more than $5 of TF2 items! Highly recommend!!			"

												Very much a game designed with fans of Tell Tale Games, Penny Arcade, and Team Fortress 2 in mind, but don't be discouraged even if your not familiar with this bizarre pick and mix of icons, you'll only miss out on a few odd inside jokes, most of the humor is generated from the interaction between the characters, so it feels rather natural. Perfect for fans of games that boast a lot of charm and personality, however, if you neither care for that, or for Poker, you'll want to give it a miss.			"

												Got to love playing poker with some of the best guys ever. Poker Night at the Inventory is quite the best at leisure Poker playing. Each character has their own playing strategy. Studying your opponent does help a bit, after a flop some reactions are staged but some can be sincere. This game should be recommend for Team Fortress 2 players (due to the unlock benefits the two games share). But you can play at your own pace and go for Steam achievements. Quite an all-round-well-playable-game. You don't know how to play Poker? No worries, you catch on fast as the game goes on. And don't be afriad to (as Tycho puts it so eloquently)  “exercise the the 'No Limit' portion of the game's rule set” by going all-in, and who knows, you may even win!			"

												If you've seen the clips of this game on YouTube, you likely know what you're going to expect.  You're also only getting about half the picture.  Shame on you.Poker Night offers a sincerely enjoyable, calm, mellow poker game that has one of the better AI engines for its genre.  It adapts, bluffs and amiably moves with you to add some genuine sense of risk and excitement, plus the colorful characters and general nostalgic charm give it a leg up over its general competition in the genre -- namely, your faceless 50-in-1 casino sims.  It's perfect for gamers and non-gamers who don't mind non-sequiters cracking their poker faces.  It's a casual game, yeah, but seldom has that ever been a bad thing.  When you're home sick from work, it's raining outside or you just don't feel up to twitch-shooters, this makes a nice companion to a cup of hot coffee and an afghan.  The shawl, not the ... yeah.

												Fanservice Poker is a game involving three guys and a furry rabbit all sitting at a table, all from different games or from a webcomic of some sort, although some originally debutting in cartoons. How these people from other worlds collided, I will never know. Doesn't the Heavy belong to the 1950s or something? In Fanservice Poker, you get to listen to conversations by your opponents. Some will get along with eachother, or otherwise, they won't. For example, the Heavy from Hat Simulator 2 is disgusted by Tycho for him wearing blue clothing or something.Winning against some of these guys will earn you more fabulous clothing for Hat Simulator 2, including some shades that will make the Demoman look more like a rapper.Go ahead and try it I guess.

												""What would Heavy Weapons Guy have to say to Strong Bad in their off-hours?""  Not a lot as it turns out.  Telltale took a chance and made a poker game by licensing characters from other properties, and it works... for a while.  The dialogue is interesting and entertaining for the first couple hours, but loses its lustre as you hear the same things over and over.  Though once in a while, you'll get a new one and the surprise of new dialogue will make it extra funny.  If you're an achievement perfectionist, you'll end up with a lot of time in this one as the odds of some of the hands are 1:64,000.  Part of where this game stumbles is the choice of more obscure characters (Strong Bad, Tycho from Penny Arcade) which not everyone will be familiar with, though that's a minor point (and the characters in Poker Night 2 are more mainstream).Verdict:  Fun for a while, but recommend waiting for a 75% off discount.  After you're tired of the dialogue, play it in a window and watch Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube in another window.  Or pick up Poker Night 2 for the same price and have options for Texas and Omaha Hold 'Em instead of just Texas.			"

The TellTale engine is solid and the witty banter by the game characters is well scripted, but can become reptitive once you've played more than a few hours. The decks and table styles which unlock are a nice touch, which helps replayability, and you can adjust the frequency of the other players' conversation in the options menu. I recommend this for poker fans or those looking for an easy game to just take a break with. The budget price is quite fair.			"

Almost like a version for kids or something. But you only play by clicking 3 buttons, Fold, Call/check, Bet/Raise. And its mostly by luck. However, this makes it the simple of Poker games.Lasting AppealIts a 5 dollar game with some interesting dialogue and easy gameplay. I recommand this for Team Fortress 2 players who are in need of new items for their collection whatsoever.  RATING : 8.3			"

												I sat down at my table,and was dealt a canny hand.Max was acting crazy;Tycho was merely bland.I had a Strong Bad feelingThat a Heavy loss was nigh;The chips were down,The ante was upI thought that I might die. As conversation moved to thingsof which I dare not speak,I kept a stolid poker faceand hoped for a lucky streak. And finally my face went flushed and I had a full house of cards. Buy this game for promos free;...it really isn't hard.  - ZK			"

Being just a card game , its fairly pick up and play and luck based as well, but it is not entirely without its skill from experience. 'Know when to hold em, know when to fold em' as they say.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a fun short game, and will give you plenty of enjoyment along the lines of minesweeper and solitaire. The dialogue is hilarious for the first few rounds, and then they definitely begin to repeat frequently. All the same though, for someone who had never played poker before, it teaches the rules of the game well, helps you to become better, all the while earning you some fun items for TF2! What more can you ask for in a game you can get for $2.50. The answer is nothing. Pick this fun gem up during a steam sale. 8/10			"

												This is an odd one to ""beat,"" but there is a system somewhat a kin to boss battles. Each character will randomly buy in with special items. If you eliminate them from that tournament, you get their item, e.g. Max's badge and gun. So for purposes of cataloging, I'm going to say that getting all of those items is ""beating"" the game. It actually takes a fair amount of time for all of them to buy in with their items. The most disappointing thing about this game is that there is no multiplayer at all, which seems odd for a poker game. It's purely single player Texas Hold'em. There is a fair amount of dialog for each character, but you'll definitely hear it all multiple times prior to unlocking most of the achievements. It was a $5 game at launch though, so maybe it's a classic ""you get what you pay for.""			"

Of course it was expected from the guy that comes from a web comic where text is everything. But is this a game where it simply puts previously thought characters in a simple Texas Hold 'em game? HELL...eh...kinda...but does it matter? HELL NO! You can learn how to actually PLAY poker (I knew nothing about the game and now I win about 80% of the time) AND because of their speaking it never feels boring or too heavy. Of course there's the TF2 items but if promosional items are the only reason you buy games, you can get genuines WAAY cheaper at the market. Buy this game. NOW. IN THIS INSTANT. AND THE SEQUEL TOO!

												This is an interesting one. I like poker, specifically Texas Hold'em, so I was delighted when that is what this is. But when you play it, it is more than just a generic poker game. The characters around the table are bursting with bubbly personalities, and they each interact with each other in a different manner. They even bad mouth you if you start winning heaps of money. The incentive of limited Team Fortress 2 items is a nice draw too, but what it boils down to is the poker. It explains how to play, but even so, you can get lost and confused by the game. Although you may eventually get these items and finish the achievements, it'll be a horrific journey of confusion and near-suicidal rages. Be warned, only for those that can take losing.7/10			"

												While you won't like this game if you don't like poker, its not a bad place to start with the humor of the four other players at the table adding to the experience. Being just a card game , its fairly pick up and play and luck based as well, but it is not entirely without its skill from experience. 'Know when to hold em, know when to fold em' as they say.

												Poker Night pits you against four arguably famous characters in a game of Texas Hold 'Em for virtual cash you don't have to pay for. Essentially, you can waste as much as you wish, as the game is centered around fun and character rather than actual high-stakes Poker.The highlight of this game is the dialogue between characters. Even if you don't know Max, Tycho, Strong Bad or Heavyweapons Guy, you'll quickly learn that each of them are mentally ill in their own fun, quirky little way.Oh, and you learn how to play Texas Hold 'Em. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. The game's really luck-based, so just know what you can do and hope for the best.Poker Night at the Inventory is $4.99 USD. In game prizes can be used in Team Fortress 2 as well. Visit the store page for more details.			"

												As poker games go, this one is frustrating, slow, and the AI seems to lack any particular skill. I bought this because I'm a major Strong Bad fan, and on that front, I wasn't disappointed. Switching the options to make the characters more talkative gives you some interesting conversations to listen in to, and the interactions change depending on which characters have been knocked out of the tournament. There are genuinely funny laugh-out-loud moments, particularly if you've previously been acquainted with Strong Bad and Tycho.The problem is, even the converstation between players is randomly generated - that means that you'll sometimes watch them hold the same dialogue twice in the matter of a couple of minutes. Add to this that the players can't seem to make a single action (be that check, bet or fold) without delievering a Shakespearean-length soliloquy, showing down the play even further, and the voices start to lose their apppeal pretty quickly. Turning down the verbosity options doesn't actually help to speed things up, unfortunately. And the narrator likes to announce the hands and the winner of each pot with remarkable languidness... languiditude... lang..., la... SLOWNESS, and you can't skip him. The entertainment value is okay. But what you've really got here is a webseries with a lot of episodes with pop culture characters interacting in the context of a poker game. If the interactions were released as a series of 2-3 minute YouTube videos, I'd happily watch them all. But the AI is not well enough developed to make the game skillful, and the resulting luck-fest drags incredibly slowly. The computer can't recognise the difference between a minimum raise and a 6x bet, unless you push all-in. The other characters base their bets on the overall strength of their hand, with no concept of comparing their hand to others (that is, they seem to gladly go all-in when playing the board, regardless of their hole cards or possible kickers). I started playing with the difficulty on Hard, and this seems to translate as ""Other players don't fold to your bets, making it a chase to the river, which you'll usually lose"". Perhaps I'm being unfair.If you want a good, thinking man's poker game, look elsewhere. If you want to have a chuckle at Strong Bad being goaded by Heavy Weapons Guy, or Tycho checking with the delcaration ""chkdsk"", it's an entertaining way to spend some time. And I expect I will continue to play it for this reason, despite my frustrations with the play speed.Oh, and I've never played any of the Sam & Max games. But playing poker against Max today, I've realised that he's one annoying bunny, and I never want to see his face again. Jerk.			"

												Ah,Poker Night at the inventory.an very funny game.So let's do an review about it,shall we?The GameYou are playing against Homestar Runners from Superikone Strong Bad,Max from Sam & max,and the Heavy Weapons Guy(or short Heavy(Red)) from tf2(maybe missed 1 there).The game comes with new lines for each character, responses on certain situation. Thats supposed to make them look more alive, which it does,its very funny to see the face of the Heavy getting kicked out from the Table by either you or one of the other 3. But thats not the main part why many people play this Game.For each bounty you can win there,you get items,only optainable by playing that game,for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2Yes,if you didn't knew that already well now you do.you can unlock hats 1 pistole replacemend and 1 spy watch replacemend too if i remember right(atleast for Team Fortress).and for Borderlands 2 some cosmetic for your characters.This game Costs 5€ on Steam,  and its worth it to give it a try.BUTOne big fact,which made it kinda bad,and reduced the play time for maybe the one or another hour,was how you earn these ItemsYou don't earn them by playing the matchs fully,they appear randomly  each time you start the game.Theres an,decent enough,chance of getting to win 1 of the 4 items,when one of them brings one in,you just have to win the match and kick everyone out of the Table.Now,i will NOT explain how that game exactly works,like the gamemodes, since its easy to learn(maybe you will have a bit of struggle in the beginning if you are completly new to it but it will stop after a while) Overall,Its an very funny Game,the downsides are,that you can easily win an game if you don't increase the difficulty,which isn't needed to win these items,and that they appear at pure random,making Winning without one not needed at all.Lukily,it is fixed in the next game,but more to that in the Review for it.I do recommend it, but if you aren't sure about it,wait until an discount is out for it and buy it then,since it might not be worth it for you in the end.But for both,the items you can get and playtime itself,its kinda worth it(if you want to play it just for the items,theres an easier way of getting them listed above,you can do it,but you don't have to) "

												It's hard to comment on a game like this.  It's like commenting on the Solitaire game that came with my computer but I'll try.  As far as a poker game goes, it's great.  On poker sites like PokerStars, the tables are rigged so rare hands happen more frequently than they naturally should to keep it exciting but this game as far as I can tell is legitimately random in it's card selection which I like very much.  If you know the characters then the comments during the game will crack you up but they're joy fades quickly as they will be repeating themselves by the second or third game.  If you play TF2 then you definitely will want to win the items that you can use and you'll get even more determined every time one of them slips by you.  This game was actually given to me as a gift (thanks Aserwarth) but I definitely would have spent $5 on it, but probably not much more.  Basically, if you even know Strong Bad, then eat cereal instead of going to McDonalds tonight and buy Poker Night.			"

												This is game about the Heavy and his friend rabbit and mexican wrestler midget. There is also huge jerk white boy who is convinced he is sexy and cool but he is a real jerk and ruins the experience for everybody. Heavy decide it is good time to play poker with friends and one disliked associate, and they do. Heavy ends up winning most games, and everybody laugh except white boy who doesn't like losing. Heavy is gracious host, however, and give all earnings to charity like money for weak children with bone diseases and neural trauma caused by faulty wiring in subways and also poorly put together McDonalds toys. White boy would use his earnings for selfish stuff like new watch which he lost playing poker and also lifetime subscription to Martha Stewart because he is girly HA HA HA HA HA.It is easy to recommend game because it contains much of stuff people have come to expect from fine people over at bungie and warioware. Much action and drama and adventure and co-starring Sean Connery.			"

												It's a cheap, $5, TF2 promo-riddled bundle that is more.The quartet of well-known internet figures have their moments in terms of dialog, but it is mediocre, yet entertaining.The poker part is well structured, though the lack of being able to use keys is a little off putting.Overall, worth a weekend to get the TF2 items and unlock everything.

												This game has possibly the funniest writing I've seen in a while. Poker Night at the inventory bring The Heavy, Strongbad, Max, Tycho, and you into a high stakes poker game with massive amounts of witty comments, and a decent amount of unlockables. The unlockable are probably what sold this game to a lot of people, especially since each character has a TF2 usable item, but there are also in game unlocks as well. All in all worth every penny, even without the TF2 items.  I'd like to see a sequel of a different game with the same premise, and different characters. Maybe Parcheesi			"

												My brother tried to explain poker to me dozens of times, yet I never was able to understand how the game is played. Nevertheless, I stepped into this game with hopes of a good tutorial. Its tutorial may not be the finest, but I guarantee that you'll learn to play poker in just 20 minutes of playing this game, not to mention how fun to play it is because of all the unlockables (tables, decks, Team Fortress 2 items...) and the character dialogue (there are four ""dialogues"" which dictate what the characters will speak, and you can also uncensor the by-default-censored funny lines).

												Meh. The only real reason to get this is to get the TF2 items, and hear the dialogue I guess. Honestly, it's a pretty mediocre poker game with not much too it. Once you figure out the characters and how they play, the game becomes incredibly easy. The dialogue is ammusing the first time you hear it, and then it keeps repearting and repeating. Honestly, not that great, and the sequel isn't that great either. Kind of disappointing when you consider how good a lot of the other games Telltale released are.			"

												Ah,Poker Night at the inventory.an very funny game.So let's do an review about it,shall we?The GameYou are playing against Homestar Runners from Superikone Strong Bad,Max from Sam & max,and the Heavy Weapons Guy(or short Heavy(Red)) from tf2(maybe missed 1 there).The game comes with new lines for each character, responses on certain situation. Thats supposed to make them look more alive, which it does,its very funny to see the face of the Heavy getting kicked out from the Table by either you or one of the other 3. But thats not the main part why many people play this Game.For each bounty you can win there,you get items,only optainable by playing that game,for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2Yes,if you didn't knew that already well now you do.you can unlock hats 1 pistole replacemend and 1 spy watch replacemend too if i remember right(atleast for Team Fortress).and for Borderlands 2 some cosmetic for your characters.This game Costs 5€ on Steam,  and its worth it to give it a try.BUTOne big fact,which made it kinda bad,and reduced the play time for maybe the one or another hour,was how you earn these ItemsYou don't earn them by playing the matchs fully,they appear randomly  each time you start the game.Theres an,decent enough,chance of getting to win 1 of the 4 items,when one of them brings one in,you just have to win the match and kick everyone out of the Table.Now,i will NOT explain how that game exactly works,like the gamemodes, since its easy to learn(maybe you will have a bit of struggle in the beginning if you are completly new to it but it will stop after a while) Overall,Its an very funny Game,the downsides are,that you can easily win an game if you don't increase the difficulty,which isn't needed to win these items,and that they appear at pure random,making Winning without one not needed at all.Lukily,it is fixed in the next game,but more to that in the Review for it.I do recommend it, but if you aren't sure about it,wait until an discount is out for it and buy it then,since it might not be worth it for you in the end.But for both,the items you can get and playtime itself,its kinda worth it(if you want to play it just for the items,theres an easier way of getting them listed above,you can do it,but you don't have to) "

												The good points of this game might be the low price, the witty dialog and the TF2 items as rewards. Some rare dialog seems to occur in special cases too, such as when the heavy upturned the poker table.However the actual game is lacking, due to the substandard AI players. For instance, the AI tends to 'bluff' far to often, without even a pair after the flop. If you go out first and spectate the rest of the game, you'll see how often this happens. Also the betting amounts seem to be eratic for anyone with some experience in poker. This was on 'hard' difficulty.I'd like to see an update for this game with a better AI, though allowing some sort of multiplayer might make it more interesting too, as after getting the TF2 items the game looses any replayability.

												Highly Recommend. Only 5 bucks, and you get a lot of fun playing No-limit Texas Holdem with some iconic video game/online culture figures, Including The Heavy class from TF2 (Team Fortress 2), Tycho Brahe from Penny Arcade, Strongbad from Homestar Runner, and Max from Sam and Max. As an added perk, if you defeat each player in a poker tournament, with their 'sprcial buy in', which are weapons, you get to use said weapons in TF2.			"

												So the game is just your basic Texas Hold 'em, but the atmosphere is the selling point. Sitting down with the 4 characters, even if you don't know much about them to begin with, while they make interesting conversation with you and each other in a relaxing locale; that's what it's all about. Nice if you want a little break from all the fast paced do-or-die games you normally play.You can choose how often the characters talk, and if you want to speed up the actual game you can right-click to skip dialogue. You also have two difficulties to choose from, and you can unlock a few table felts and decks to add some more variety.There are some downsides though; you can't change the buy-in amount, how fast the blinds change, or make any tweaks to the actual game at all, so if you're a hard-core Hold 'em player this may turn you off. There's also no option for online play, and while that's mostly to be expected, having room for one friend to join in could have improved the life of the game quite a bit.Still, you can certainly put a number of hours into this one. Myself, I was only familiar with Strong Bad, and had never played Texas Hold 'em (and don't generally like playing cards period), but I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience with it, and it's priced low enough that you don't have much to lose.

												Poker Night at The Inventory, a game where you go all out in a battle royale against iconic characters such as The Heavy, Max, Tycho, and that one boxing guy (named Strong Bad) fighting to the death by... cards. The game is pretty nice, has comical dialouge that the characters have with each other such as The Heavy figuring out what class Tycho is, and it also gives you a chance to unlock some weapons/cosmetics you can use in Team Fortress 2, but you have to use skill and knock out the character with said item to unlock it.......or just always go all in, that works too			"

												Not a lot to say here. It's poker with a decent amount of banter between the players. The playstyle of the players mostly fits their character, though I never did figure out Max's playstyle. He was also the most fun of the characters banter-wise; Tycho is just a ♥♥♥♥ and not in any amusing way, and the Heavy and Strong Bad are both really one-note characters. The best moments are them playing off each other, and that's done fairly well, but eventually there's so little new dialogue left to hear that you're mostly stuck hearing the same things over and over.As for the gameplay, it's... poker. The AI is decent. I hardly noticed a difference between normal and hard. The only other gameplay thing I could mention are the achievements, which are... mostly luck-based. I'm not interested in grinding them out, at least, and I'm not really interested in playing this any further, either.For the low price point, I'd say it's worth it for a few hours of fun and banter, and you'd probably get more out of it if you were a poker nut, which I'm definitely not, but... yeah, alright.

												I'm gonna keep this one short;  it's a single player poker game with funny banter that wears out its welcome in 2-3 hours.  Is it worth a purchse for $5?  Short answer, Yes with an if.  Long answer no, with a but.If you are a fan of any of these characters, it's worth the asking price.  If you're not, then it's not.  It doesn't do anything revolutionary.  There is no multiplayer mode, no online, no other modes.  There are a healthy amount of unlocks and great dialogue and interaction, though it cycles through everything in 3-5 hours, depending on table composition.Check it out;  it's something to do while the game is on and worth a chuckle or three.

												Decent free poker game received free for pre-ordering another one (this game's sequel). I'm always on the lookout for poker games not involving real money, where you play A.I, rather than other humans. Other humans in freeroll games bet like idiots, see. This is well worth the price I paid for it and I've had a fun few hours with it already. A.I. is acceptable for the amount of money paid. I don't recognize the characters, though their personalies are mildly amusing. Recommended for poker fans not interested in playing with real money online (as if you do, you might as well just play for real money online than play this…).			"

If you play TF2, Sam & Max, Strong Bad or any of the Penny Arcade games then you'll want to see how well they're portrayed in this game. See a whole new side to the Heavy Weapons Guy. You can even win prizes for TF2 or unlock new content for the game itself. If you're a gambling man, this is the place to lose your chips and ruin your marriage.			"

												Surprisingly fun, even for someone like me who is hardly a poker player. Make sure you turn on the character banter, because they have some hilarious conversations between each other. Going into this game, Max was the only character I didn't recognise, but coming out of it, I went and purchased the Sam & Max game series because I found the character that entertaining.Extra fun to play if you own Team Fortress 2, as you will unlock one special item from each character that can be used in that game.

												Gotta love each of the guys's dialogs. Heavy's love for fighting, Max's histories of his previous adventures, Strong Bad's...err...himself-ish...But my favorite must be Tycho. Of course it was expected from the guy that comes from a web comic where text is everything. But is this a game where it simply puts previously thought characters in a simple Texas Hold 'em game? HELL...eh...kinda...but does it matter? HELL NO! You can learn how to actually PLAY poker (I knew nothing about the game and now I win about 80% of the time) AND because of their speaking it never feels boring or too heavy. Of course there's the TF2 items but if promosional items are the only reason you buy games, you can get genuines WAAY cheaper at the market. Buy this game. NOW. IN THIS INSTANT. AND THE SEQUEL TOO!

												While the game says it's for Mac, I tend to disagree since it seems to crash every single time you boot the thing up and the characters perform their buy-in animation after the tutorial prompt.This problem doesn't seem to occur on Windows based machines, or if it does, it appears uncommon. The situation occurs with Mac OS's above 10.5 however seem to be consistant, but Telltale seems to have absolutly no interest in fixing this glairing issue if the community hub and lack of updates are anything to go by.If you're on a mac, give this a pass and go right to Poker Night 2 or skip the whole series all together so maybe they can get their act together and at least update the specs on the games system requirements section.

												It's enjoyable. It's Texas Hold'em Poker - Nothing special there - and if you like that game, then this is a fine version of it. The opponents are characters of some note and provide humourous commentary, but after enough time playing the game, you'll have heard them all and all you'll want is for them to be silent, but there is sadly no option to silence them altogether so you'll have to settle for slightly less talkative. There are different difficulties, but they seem largely the same and are all fairly challengingThe game's a bit unoptimized and the soundtrack seems to be just that one song that repeats endlessly, but beyond the mind-numbing nature of repeatedly playing poker against the same enemies in the same environment with the same music, at least the varied commentary keeps it from eating away at one's sanity too much.The achievements are painful because they are dependent upon happening upon select poker hands at random and for exceedingly rare ones like four-of-a-kind, straight-flush, three-of-a-kind with Kings, it will likely require a lot of playing.One of the main reasons to get this game is for the Team Fortress 2 unlockable equipment which aren't terribly hard to get. Other unlockables in this game include in-game card-decks and table-tops. I question if this game is not cloud-save-enabled because, after reinstalling, all my progress from the last time it was installed was absent so I had to re-earn all of the unlocks.			"

												Honestly I just bought the game because it was on sale once for 0,99€ and I was intrigued by the TF2 items. After playing for a while I realized that the game is more that just a cash-in on in-games items. It actually has a lot of humor and you'll probably get a good laugh from the dialog between the characters, if you know them of course.The TF2 awards are actually really satisfying to win, because it isn't just handed to you for buying the game. No, you have to win it. Thus making this game really enjoyable, it feels like you're actually getting something out of it. It drives you into wanting to win a poker match and dread losing because you have to start over again.Do not worry to much about not knowing poker, I still have no idea what I'm doing. The game actually helps you to understand a thing or two neatly without forcing you trough some dumb tutorial.5€ is still an okay price, you'll probably get a lot of fun out of it even if you're just in it for the TF2 stuff.8/10			"

												Truthfully I only bought this game for the free tf2 items. It wasnt even that fun when i was playing, but I did enjoy it a little which is why it pains me to not recomend but I truly cant tell you to get this game it just isnt even a good poker game. (not to mention I am preaty sure it is rigged)I have also heard that this game does not work well on mac (this is just what I have seen when I was doing reserch for this before I went talking for I do not have a mac)I give it a 5 out of 5. :(come on Telltale Games ou can do better then this! This isnt even worth doing a video on YouTube for! (you can even go see I didnt do a video on this just look up DragonHeart000 without any spaces)I truly think they could of done better, But i want to end with a positive note which is also a contributing factor to why this game got 5 and not less, the table talk is hilarious!!! I mean i have literaly LOL'ed when playing this so if you want a joke game this game is for you but i know not many people do, I am one of the few which is why i may get poker night 2...			"

												There is a serious issue if you run this game on Mac computers. It will always crashes right before it deals the hand. Waste of my 5$ but the game has humor and really the only reason people play this is to get the TF2 items. Playing Poker with friends is much more enjoyable however playing against Heavy and Max puts a smile on my face everytime they start a conversation. In my opinion, Poker Night 2 is superior because it actually works on both platforms and the humor in that game, which is one of the only two reasons you would play Poker Night, is far superior and a great improvement from the last one. This isn't anything special and if you are just bored and want to have a laugh it's alright but over-all not worth the money.			"

												Anyone who is familiar any of these characters ought to give this a try.  A humorous, well done crossover, where the character interaction is spot on and no one feels out of character.  Oh yeah, poker fans ought to try it as well, even if you don't know these characters.  In addition to the dialogue, the various characters each seem to have unique playstyles to keep you on end.Either way, I hope more crossovers like this happen in the future.			"

Also, getting them took only 2 hours. Really had a lot of fun playing it and hearing everybody just have funny conversations about random things. It was pretty cool. Anyways, if TF2 players want cosmetics play Poker Night 2. But collectors I reccomend this one, its awesome Suggestions if there is a Poker Night 3-Online-More Items-Longer -Make characters alternate games, like have 12 different ones but change every game, leading to more TF2 items.-Design your own character-Make him have a voice so you can talk back to those scumbags who ♥♥♥♥ you over alot (Ash)-Private Matchs (Poker with your friends!)

												As other reviewers have said before me, if you have a Mac (or as I've heard, anything newer then Windows 7) don't buy this game. It still works on older systems, though even then its buggy as heck. As for newer, theres something internally in the game that desperately needs the update Telltale refuses to give. You're best off saving your 5 bucks for something more worthwhile.			"

How am I supposed to get a full house or four of a kind with only two cards?

												Fanservice Poker is a game involving three guys and a furry rabbit all sitting at a table, all from different games or from a webcomic of some sort, although some originally debutting in cartoons. How these people from other worlds collided, I will never know. Doesn't the Heavy belong to the 1950s or something? In Fanservice Poker, you get to listen to conversations by your opponents. Some will get along with eachother, or otherwise, they won't. For example, the Heavy from Hat Simulator 2 is disgusted by Tycho for him wearing blue clothing or something.Winning against some of these guys will earn you more fabulous clothing for Hat Simulator 2, including some shades that will make the Demoman look more like a rapper.Go ahead and try it I guess.

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a simple concept, executed well. It takes a few well-known characters in the gaming/geek world, puts them together at a poker table, and you get to play poker with them. If you are at all familiar with Texas Hold-em poker, and don't find the game absolutely horrible, there is some fun to be had with this title. The main source of fun comes from the interactions between the different characters. If you know these characters, it makes the banter even better as you will be delighted to see their personalities are kept true to their source material. It's like playing poker with some semi-celebrities: no more, no less.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												I downloaded this game originally on the basis I could get items for TF2. But on playing the game I have soon learned that the layout and characterization of the individual players is amazing. The talk and actual game play is engaging and highly addictive. I soon learned that the items you could achieve were nice bonuses but the game could hold itself up without the offer of items. I look forward to getting the second version of this game and completing the first one which I don't think will take me too long to do. I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes Poker or is a fan of the characters in this game.			"

												This game is dirt cheap for a good reason. There's not much to it at all. If you like playing Texas Hold Em you'll probably want to give this a shot. If you're a fan of the characters you play poker with in this game, then more power to you. The only characters i'm really familiar in this are The Heavy and Strongbad (meh). These aren't the most exciting video game characters to play poker with. Their conversations can sometimes be sorta funny if you're familiar with the games they're from because they pretty much just reference ♥♥♥♥ from those. They also tend to get a little annoying (Strongbad + Max) That cartoon bunny rabbit is one step away from becoming Jar Jar Binks.If you're thinking about buying this game don't purchase it for more than $2.

												There is a serious issue if you run this game on Mac computers. It will always crashes right before it deals the hand. Waste of my 5$ but the game has humor and really the only reason people play this is to get the TF2 items. Playing Poker with friends is much more enjoyable however playing against Heavy and Max puts a smile on my face everytime they start a conversation. In my opinion, Poker Night 2 is superior because it actually works on both platforms and the humor in that game, which is one of the only two reasons you would play Poker Night, is far superior and a great improvement from the last one. This isn't anything special and if you are just bored and want to have a laugh it's alright but over-all not worth the money.			"

												Definitely one of Telltale Games must haves. The game itself runs well and the mechanics are the same as with any other Texas Hold 'Em Poker game you would run in to, but what makes this game worthwhile is the characters you play against. Max, The Heavy, Strong Bad & Tycho share hilarious, well-written banter between each other and the player, making it fun to stick around and play just to see what they will start babbling about next. Obviously a fair amount of banter is humour and in-jokes from their respective games/web-series, but is done in a way so it is still amusing to those who are not familiar with their respective Franchises. Another nice touch is the range of reactions the characters have to actions the player has. For example going All-In, depending on the situation, can cause the whole table to turn and look at you with suprise and shout. Alternitively the characters will also act smug if they have the upper hand, or get angry or frustrated if you are winning that hand. All in all, this is one of the most funny and interesting Poker Sims to play, and worth having for the occasional hand of Poker, with a table of characters who are very much, insane.			"

												Poker with a few witty comments from the characters you play with.I don't suggest it to achievement completionists. Since it's an RNG thing, it's insanely frustrating to get a royal flush, I still haven't even gotten 4 of a kind.If you want casual poker to play and relax to, this just might be for you. But at times the comments can get a bit boring and even annoying. Don't suggest it at full price tho. It ain't that good.			"

												This game in my opinion is half half meaning I would recommend it for certain people but shouldn't be recommended for others. Firstly, this game CAN NOT run on macs. Secondly, if you are not into tf2 or gambling this game is not for you because all it is for is free tf2 items like the lugermorph, iron curtain, Dangeresque, Too?, the Enthusiast's Timepiece, and the License to Maim. The reasons for why I WOULD recommend it are simply if you like playing poker sure buy it. If you enjoy tf2 and you want some ""Free items"" go ahead buy it. If you have a pc then sure go ahead and buy it! :)Forum Page (Not Runnable on Mac): https://steamcommunity.com/app/31280/discussions/0/828934913213021935/ "

												I won't lie. This is a fun game. The characters are funny and you can get TF2 items. However, what pisses me off is that it lies about OSX support.

												I would now warn all people buying all Telltale Games. This game was so much fun, and I love poker, so I bought it hoping to have a quick and fun poker game to play casually. I have a Mac, and this worked out wonderfully for a while. Then, Mac 10.8 was released, and the game would now crash right after the tutorial. TTG refuses to patch the game, and urges those seeking refunds to go to Steam to request those refunds, knowing full well that Steam would not honor these refund requests.Instead of taking responsibility, TTG passed on the blame. Before, they did not mark a ""maximum"" system requirement and continued to sell a game that did not work for their customers.Instead of just fixing the game, now the requirements on Steam read ""Not Compatible with Mac OS 10.8.x and above"". I hope you read that, because otherwise you dropped $4.99 down the proverbial toilet.I'm just waiting to see what other flaw or oversight they choose to ignore in the future. I trust them about as far and I can throw them.			"

												Pokr Night at the Inventory is a game about - Well, poker. You play at a place called the Inventory, Kinda like a bar for video game characters. Probably the main aesthetic to this game is that you play with four players, all from different games. Even if you (Somehow) dont know any of these people its still a great and worthwhile expirience. Fortunatly, unlike most card games out there, its not stale and boring. The characters chat and make references to their own or other peoples games, which I liked ALOT. And with quirky animations, customisation of decks, varing difficulty, trading cards and achievments - all at a low price, you'd be stupid not to pick up this title.You also get free tf2 Stuff.Basically why 90% of people buy it.Not even kidding.

												Time for a honest responseThis game is a very good way to train yourself in poker. The game itself is also good since the ""computers"" would go all in if they have a good hand or if they want to bluff. This makes the game always different everytime you start a new game. The jokes are also very good and will make you have a good laugh.Overall 8/10			"

												Filled with absurb humour and fun poker playing at a reasonable price, Poker Night at The Inventory is a good game for anyone who is a fan of poker, Homestar Runner, Sam 'n Max, Penny Arcade or Team Fortress 2. Perhaps especially so with Team Fortress 2. The game features several interesting (if cosmetic) unlockables at less than Mann Co. Store prices, when taken all together. Combined with the fact that you're getting a free game, it's worth it to any 'hard-core' TF2 fan. Besides, you may find you enjoy the game of Texas Hold'Em on its own merits.As for me, I think the biggest factor going for the game is the humor value. The characters are lovable, the unlocks good for a giggle or two, but overall, the conversations are the most interesting aspect of this game. I sincerely hope there will be a sequel, preferably with a few more characters. (TF2 Unlocks optional, frankly.)While I am blue skying though, I wish people would buy in with collateral after you have already won it.			"

												I thought it was a cool and realistic poker simulation, all I did was go all in, and they always folded and I got a lot of money. So I went to Las Vegas and went to the best casino there, and I did the same thing. This is nothing like poker. This game ruined my life. I am currently writing this in a library on the street. I have barely any clothes, it was a miracle they let me in the library. I have no wife or children, they left me. Every day is a constant battle, where I am fighting suicide. This game is horrible, all I got from this are some virual items to use in an FPS called ""Team Fortress 2"". This game ruined my life forever.10/10Would put a gun to my mouth again.			"

												It's a tough call this one. On one hand, it has pretty good writing and voice work that really capitalizes on the absurdity of the players. On the other hand, It's just poker. There's tells and TF2 items to incentivise you to keep going, but it never feels like more than playing poker.I'd say for five bucks, it does enough to warrant a play through.

The problem is, it doesn't work with newer macs! it's a few years old too so i thought they would've updated it. every time i click the done button right after it explains the rules, it crashes! i looked into it and found a few interesting guides to what works and what doesn't.Poker Night at the Inventory on Mac computers is only compatible with OS X 10.5.x through 10.7.5. If you experience a crash on OS X 10.8.x or above, please try running the game on a compatible Mac or PC computer.Hi, I recently bought this game and quickly found out that after clicking the ""done"" button on the tutorial, the whole game falls apart and crashes, I browsed along some threads on steam and found that this crash problem happens to a lot of other people. I also found out that this problem has been going on for a long time. I later saw that Poker Night at the Inventory is ""not compatible with Mac OS 10.8 and above"", to which I ask, WHY? Does this mean we have to downgrade our macs just so we can play this game? I have OS X Yosemite, and I am not gonna downgrade my mac just so I can play this game. I also found out that TellTale games has not made any plans regarding to fixing this problem, to which I ask again, WHY? One of your games is having problems that prevents people from playing it, so I expect that you should fix it soon, I want a reasonable answer of why this is not fixed yet.1 CommentUser Avatar ImageTelltaleMike  Telltale Staff Flag  Hide commentI apologize for any difficulties this has caused you. As stated on the game's Store Page on Steam:Not Compatible with Mac OS 10.8.x and aboveWe recommend playing the game on a system that meets the minimum system requirements if you have the ability to. If you do not have a system that meets the requirements, we encourage you to contact Steam Support for any inquiries regarding refunds or refund requests.Here's what I've concluded:Mid 2011 Macbook Pro - OSX Mt. Lion: Crash after rules of poker are explainedLate 2012 Macbook Pro - OSX Mt. Lion: Crash after rules of poker are explainedGateway NV Series - Windows 7: Crashed on install initially, now runs okay, but slowlyDell Latitude - Windows XP: No problems, runs really wellAll computers have at least 4 gigs of RAM and i5 Processors, except for the Gateway which is a dual-core.I'm thinking it's possibly OSX Mt. Lion related since they're the only computers that can't run it at all.If you bought it and can't play it, just try to get a refund. it's just a regular poker game. And if you wanted the tf2 items that badly, just borrow a friend or parent's computer and try it on that			"

												One of the best games I have in my library, and one of the games I am most proud to own.Although it's old, I enjoy the classic characters like Max, Strong Bad (UPDATE, HSR), and Tycho, along with a modern Heavy.The comedy twist is great, the dialogue is also very... True, to say the least.It's very fun, and I learned how to play poker (gamble) in less than a week when I got it.One of the best games, 10/10, YES!Can't wait to get Poker Night 2 on my iPad to play on my next trip.

												Pros:-Characters are fun and memorable (Sam & Max and Homestar Runner were my childhood, Heavy is perfect, and Tycho is... there)-Music is fantastic-Good graphics-The item unlocks are awesomeCons:-AI isn't perfect-Repetive with only one type of poker-It takes a lot of tries to get the item you want up for grabsOverall, an enjoyable experience. I may not like poker all that much (and to be fair, I suck at it), but I like Poker Night at the Inventory.  "

												I highly recommend this game to anyone, you don't have to be good at poker,  you just have to know the basics (or be willing to learn the basics). Because of the simple fact: Your opponents make the game great. Who hasn't played a game and thought: ""I would so kick his butt in texas hold em"" or ""I want to know more of the damaged mind that is Max"" You will get alot of playtime enjoying the conversations between the characters, and when you've heard it all you can just mute them and enjoy a good poker game. 7.8/10			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is an unique game in my point of view. Though, it is a gambling game alright. The characters are also very unique in personality. The game is also funny in humor, jokes, and dialogues. But, what's makes this game lucrative is the earnable items from TF2 if one of the players in the game give their item. Unlockable Items From TF2:1. Dangeresque, Too? from Super Bad2. License to Maim and The Lugermorph from Max3. Iron Curtain from Heavy 4. Enthusiast's Timepiece from Tycho.With these characters in the game, it makes the whole game fun. There are 2 purposes that why people buy this game.1. To obtain the free items from the game.2. To enjoy the gameplay that was made to.I rather not uninstall this game after earning them all. So, take some time to play it regularly and experience the full Poker Night at the Inventory. 4 stars out of 5.			"

												I'm gonna keep this one short;  it's a single player poker game with funny banter that wears out its welcome in 2-3 hours.  Is it worth a purchse for $5?  Short answer, Yes with an if.  Long answer no, with a but.If you are a fan of any of these characters, it's worth the asking price.  If you're not, then it's not.  It doesn't do anything revolutionary.  There is no multiplayer mode, no online, no other modes.  There are a healthy amount of unlocks and great dialogue and interaction, though it cycles through everything in 3-5 hours, depending on table composition.Check it out;  it's something to do while the game is on and worth a chuckle or three.

If you're a fan of the characters you play poker with in this game, then more power to you. The only characters i'm really familiar in this are The Heavy and Strongbad (meh). These aren't the most exciting video game characters to play poker with. Their conversations can sometimes be sorta funny if you're familiar with the games they're from because they pretty much just reference ♥♥♥♥ from those. They also tend to get a little annoying (Strongbad + Max) That cartoon bunny rabbit is one step away from becoming Jar Jar Binks.If you're thinking about buying this game don't purchase it for more than $2.

También podés cambiar las cartas (hay barajas del TF2) y el paño de la mesa a medida que vas ganando.Tengo que resaltar de nuevo los diálogos, la verdad que se pasaron, estuve jugando todo el tiempo con una sonrisa, jaja.

												Just like TellTale's other poker game, ""TellTale Texas Hold em"" released in 2005, ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" is another bland, repitive entry in TellTale's attempt at a Poker game.The changes between ""Poker Night"" and ""TellTale Texas Hold em"" is a more interesting dialouge, table and card skins, and items for Team Fortress 2. The AI is still makes predictable choices and often, games can be won just by going all-in and forcing the AI to fold. Stick with Zynga's Texas Hold em game. At least you'll be playing against real humans, who, although at times mimic the AI in ""Poker Night,"" will still be entertaining as you wipe out their banks.			"

												This game is a great little distraction. Each character has a very distinct personality, and card playing style! There is no tutorial, but if you press Escape it gives you a quick cheat sheet of what cards you want in your hand. Having never played poker before in my life, I now find myself booting up this game when I have a little extra time on my hands, and I'm feeling lucky. The TF2 items are icing on the cake, and I'm willing to bet that Telltale will introduce more items/characters in DLC later on. Check this one out!			"

												This backroom Poker tournament simulator of sorts is one of those games that I wouldn't have expected to grow quite so much on me. Granted, playing Poker against artificial intelligence doesn't entail the same satisfaction that one gets from successfully bluffing or showing a superior hand to fellow human players, however the entertainment value here lies within the often satirical, tongue-in-cheek and cleverly crass character dialogue and interactions with one another, complimented by the appropriately ambient visuals and music. To enjoy the spoken content at its best, be sure to enable maximum chatter in the options menu. I personally relish the sense of humor in this game, and will sometimes just sit idly at the virtual table simply watching and listening to the banter going back and forth; from Heavy's uncharacteristically tender and touching anecdote of a sparrow encountered back at Motherland, to Tycho's eyebrow-raising fantasies of intimately bonding with particular species of animals.When set to Easy, this game offers a fun way for players who are new to the Texas Hold 'em variant of Poker to grasp its fundamentals, however in order to get proper practice it's ultimately best to experience playing against real people with their own individual tactical mindsets as opposed to fictional characters with preset and non-unique betting behaviors.

												Get the money and buy this game. I bought it because I had an interest in it, it was on sale (offering Team Fortress 2 items was just a bonus). And I am so glad I did. If I just want to relax for alittle bit I can play a few hands then close it, it's nice. Plus the dialog between the characters is amazing and vast (I am still hearing lines I have never heard, I actually wonder if they update it).Also unlike some computer card games, this game is fair, it doesn't seem at all like the computer cheats and get's lucky hands, the game is well balanced and extremely  enjoyable so go buy it already			"

												Fun when your bored, a decent poker simulation with a video game twist, only issue is the game encourages you to buy everyone drinks to get them to show hints about their cards.  While the idea is great, the actual results are not, the players give little to no increase in body language, and the few movements they do make tell litterally nothing.  This makes the game a challenge at times and is largely based on luck.  But besides that I quite enjoyed the game even though the reason I bought it was the tf2 items.  The characters have their respective personalities but as with real humans they can be quite unpredictable.  One minute you might bluff and go all in and everyone folds, then you do it again in an entirely different game and everyone goes all in too and you get completely demolished.  It's one game where the RNG system is actually fun.  7.92/10 -Scale of edgy approval			"

												What's there to say about Poker Night at the Inventory?It's a fun poker game that you can just jump into whenever you want, to play with the four hilarious characters. It teaches you how to play poker casually very quickly, which is fun, though I think that an online multiplayer where you can just pick one of the four characters and play with three friends would be a very good addition to the game. The only real ""complaint"" I have with this game is that the smalltalk the characters make gets quite repetitive and boring very quickly, but that's about it.Overall, very fun if you want to play something different for once.7,5/10			"

												Forget the TF2 items for a moment, this one is all about the banter between the characters as you take their money in Texas Hold'em poker. Strong Bad is particularly great, with his stories about Videlectrix and Fists of Knuckles films, while Tycho has a weird fetish for Giraffes and Hedgehogs. Heavy's and SB's nightmares are hilarious and there's lots of fan service for all the characters. Unfortunately no multiplayer or alternative poker types, and the dialogue sometimes repeats too frequently, although there is a lot of it. Lots of card and table skins to unlock too - one turns Max into a skeleton.			"

												I enjoy poker. It's very neat. The strategy involved and the manipulation require that one be always on their toes when playing. So, when a game that gives out TF2 items and has poker in it was brought to my attention, I bought it. And I made the stupid decision to play it until I had seen all the items. Unfortunately, the variance of the game was all left to the dialogue and it doesn't take long to hear the same 20 quips for the 50th time. The background is kinda dull, but the game is fun when you get down to it. I recommend for the items and the game itself, but not for the fun factor.			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone, you don't have to be good at poker,  you just have to know the basics (or be willing to learn the basics). Because of the simple fact: Your opponents make the game great. Who hasn't played a game and thought: ""I would so kick his butt in texas hold em"" or ""I want to know more of the damaged mind that is Max"" You will get alot of playtime enjoying the conversations between the characters, and when you've heard it all you can just mute them and enjoy a good poker game. 7.8/10			"

												I actually played the Poker Night games out of order, since I only discovered them this year, and my Mac was too new to play the original.  I recently set up a Windows system, partly just to try this title, to see how it compared to Poker Night 2.I was glad to see that the fundamentals--the music, the ambiance, the banter, the general coolness--are just as strong.  Poker Night 2 is slightly fancier, but everything that makes it enjoyable is in the original.  I did, however, find the cast to be a bit less interesting than the sequel's, Max notwithstanding.In general I'm glad to have Poker Night 2's experience continued, if backward.			"

												There's lots of free high quality single-player poker games available these days, so why should you pay for this one? What sets it apart?Two things. First, you get to play against four colorful, interesting opponents. Second, there's a fun unlock system in which you can earn new decks and tables. This has no effect on gameplay, but does give you a feeling of accomplishment.Bad things. The game frames per second is sometimes poor. I'm playing on Windows 7 64 bit and my computer has no problem running modern games. So a six year old game like this really shouldn't ever be stuttering. It's still very playable though.Also, after about a dozen games you'll have heard all of the voice chatter of your opponents and it'll start to become repetitive. You do have the option to reduce voice chatter or turn it off, however.It took me 16 hours to unlock everything and at a cost of only 5 bucks I can't complain. If you're looking for a colorful poker game this might be for you!			"

												A slow paced, repetitive poker game with few laughs and no challenge whatsoever.I like a single player experience but this one doesn't bring much to the virtual poker table. Most of the jokes fall flat and start repeating before the end of the first game. The lowest dialogue frequency setting still isn't low enough. And while being able to skip to the end of hands you fold, the game goes at a snail's pace. Which on paper seems okay for a poker game, and the characters you play do indeed seem to give off reads or clues about what cards they are holding. But I never bothered learning them. The randomness that would be a shuffled deck of playing cards doesn't feel so random here. Even on hard the odds seem stacked well in your favor as long as you play even half smart. The game is extremely easy. So then it circles back and the pacing just comes off as too slow trying to click away to the inevitable win.I liked the concept but it didn't work. I still don't know who the unlikable ""Tycho"" character is suppose to be. And supposedly you can unlock Team Fortress 2 items if you play that game. I don't. Beyond killing a couple hours the game didn't offer up much beyond the concept. Delivery fell flat for me. I see there is a sequel but nothing happened here to pique my interest there. Perhaps as a mild introduction to Texas Hold'em in an amusing way it could work, but I don't know if that niche exists nowadays. Priced right for what it is but still not worth it outside of a bundle for me.			"

												""What would Heavy Weapons Guy have to say to Strong Bad in their off-hours?""  Not a lot as it turns out.  Telltale took a chance and made a poker game by licensing characters from other properties, and it works... for a while.  The dialogue is interesting and entertaining for the first couple hours, but loses its lustre as you hear the same things over and over.  Though once in a while, you'll get a new one and the surprise of new dialogue will make it extra funny.  If you're an achievement perfectionist, you'll end up with a lot of time in this one as the odds of some of the hands are 1:64,000.  Part of where this game stumbles is the choice of more obscure characters (Strong Bad, Tycho from Penny Arcade) which not everyone will be familiar with, though that's a minor point (and the characters in Poker Night 2 are more mainstream).Verdict:  Fun for a while, but recommend waiting for a 75% off discount.  After you're tired of the dialogue, play it in a window and watch Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube in another window.  Or pick up Poker Night 2 for the same price and have options for Texas and Omaha Hold 'Em instead of just Texas.			"

												This Game, sure needs a lot o comprehension. People buy it only fot the Team Fortress 2 items. That was MY case. But, when you get the way of the cards, you will start to love this game. It has a lot of positive points.PROS!!!!-Nice characters, even not the ones from Videogame world (it is you, Tycho? )-Nice conversations, these things make me laugh, and still, tells me more about some characters, like Heavy is PhD in Russian Literature.-Real Poker System (As I know it)-TF2 Items, but this can also be considered a Con-And Everything Else.CONS!!!!-The not very good start, that you have to support everytime when you start the game.-The TF2 itens.Why the last one is a Con and a Pro?These items, are good, (i Bought the game to get the dangeresque too XD ) and some may make you happy, but, the thing that makes this detail a Con, its the thing that makes this game's buyers/players only TF2 scammers, cos these guys bought the game ONLY for the items.Score : 9.9 / 10.

												As poker games go, this one is frustrating, slow, and the AI seems to lack any particular skill. I bought this because I'm a major Strong Bad fan, and on that front, I wasn't disappointed. Switching the options to make the characters more talkative gives you some interesting conversations to listen in to, and the interactions change depending on which characters have been knocked out of the tournament. There are genuinely funny laugh-out-loud moments, particularly if you've previously been acquainted with Strong Bad and Tycho.The problem is, even the converstation between players is randomly generated - that means that you'll sometimes watch them hold the same dialogue twice in the matter of a couple of minutes. Add to this that the players can't seem to make a single action (be that check, bet or fold) without delievering a Shakespearean-length soliloquy, showing down the play even further, and the voices start to lose their apppeal pretty quickly. Turning down the verbosity options doesn't actually help to speed things up, unfortunately. And the narrator likes to announce the hands and the winner of each pot with remarkable languidness... languiditude... lang..., la... SLOWNESS, and you can't skip him. The entertainment value is okay. But what you've really got here is a webseries with a lot of episodes with pop culture characters interacting in the context of a poker game. If the interactions were released as a series of 2-3 minute YouTube videos, I'd happily watch them all. But the AI is not well enough developed to make the game skillful, and the resulting luck-fest drags incredibly slowly. The computer can't recognise the difference between a minimum raise and a 6x bet, unless you push all-in. The other characters base their bets on the overall strength of their hand, with no concept of comparing their hand to others (that is, they seem to gladly go all-in when playing the board, regardless of their hole cards or possible kickers). I started playing with the difficulty on Hard, and this seems to translate as ""Other players don't fold to your bets, making it a chase to the river, which you'll usually lose"". Perhaps I'm being unfair.If you want a good, thinking man's poker game, look elsewhere. If you want to have a chuckle at Strong Bad being goaded by Heavy Weapons Guy, or Tycho checking with the delcaration ""chkdsk"", it's an entertaining way to spend some time. And I expect I will continue to play it for this reason, despite my frustrations with the play speed.Oh, and I've never played any of the Sam & Max games. But playing poker against Max today, I've realised that he's one annoying bunny, and I never want to see his face again. Jerk.			"

												Simply put, a good poker game. Has all the elements to it: Risk, Reward, Relaxing, and Hilarious. Putting characters with certain experiences makes a funny and entertaining passtime. If anyone likes poker or these characters than they should really buy the game and give it a try. With Max, Tycho, The heavy and the... red guy who i forgot... oh yes, Strongbad. They all have experiences they can brag about or be embarrased about, which when brought up by another player gives a certain reaction makes the game feel real. They can also talk to YOU. They can simply tell you to fold, and bet, or they can be irritated if you take too long to select an option. I like the character immersion in this game, and it definitely felt casual when i played this game. For anyone who wants to make good characters, you should really look at how characters can interact with each other and display their emotions and personality like in this game. Good game which i highly recommend.			"

												Very much a game designed with fans of Tell Tale Games, Penny Arcade, and Team Fortress 2 in mind, but don't be discouraged even if your not familiar with this bizarre pick and mix of icons, you'll only miss out on a few odd inside jokes, most of the humor is generated from the interaction between the characters, so it feels rather natural. Perfect for fans of games that boast a lot of charm and personality, however, if you neither care for that, or for Poker, you'll want to give it a miss.			"

												Poker Night at the Inventory is a great game for non-Poker players to learn the game.  It can be a little daunting, but playing around with three loveable characters and Tycho can really help one learn the game.  It's got a brief tutorial, but most of what you'll learn is obtained through trial and error.The TF2 bonus items are pretty sweet, and for a lot of people, it's the reason they picked up the game.My only real quarrel with Poker Night is the achievements.  Whoever assigned those needs to be dragged out in the street, tarred, then feathered.  Over half of the achievements are entirely luck based (specifically winning a hand with a particular hand of cards, requiring you to first get that hand, and then pray to whatever supernatural influence you prefer that nobody else has a better one.)For one particular example, the Straight Flush achievement has a 1-in-Thousands chance (specific number depends on who you ask it seems), and that's assuming you play every hand to the end without folding, no matter the risk.  Needless to say, seeking this achievement *will* cost you a lot of tourneys, not to mention a lot of wasted time and wear on your mouse in clicking through everything.I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to learn Texas Hold 'Em, enjoys getting TF2 items, and is NOT fussed about achievements.

And at a measley four bucks to own? You really can't get a better game for that price! I personally have forgotten about the unlocks I recieved for TF2...after all except for Strongbad's unlock they are all just detailed mods of existing items. Perhaps the loading of the game takes a bit longer than most games and some of the converstaions tend to be a tad repetative, but the positves of the game greatly outweigh  the negatives.

I've looked through many forums regarding this topic, and the only responses from Telltale Games I found were bad runarounds like ""contact Steam to get a refund"" (Steam doesn't give refunds, morons), or ""we apologize for the inconvenience"". This issue is clearly a misplaced file or some little nibbit like that. Why can't it be fixed? Basically, the game becomes completely unplayable.			"

												I'm gonna keep this one short;  it's a single player poker game with funny banter that wears out its welcome in 2-3 hours.  Is it worth a purchse for $5?  Short answer, Yes with an if.  Long answer no, with a but.If you are a fan of any of these characters, it's worth the asking price.  If you're not, then it's not.  It doesn't do anything revolutionary.  There is no multiplayer mode, no online, no other modes.  There are a healthy amount of unlocks and great dialogue and interaction, though it cycles through everything in 3-5 hours, depending on table composition.Check it out;  it's something to do while the game is on and worth a chuckle or three.

												I'mma be straight forward here: Only 2 of the main 4 characters you play Texas Hold 'Em Against I actually know of, only because of their popularity of their franchises (Sam and Max, and TF2), the other two aren't as popular or well known, so that's one flaw. Two, the item system is complete random, so it could take at least 10 minutes of you either restarting the match just for one of them to offer an item instead of money in the beginning cutscene, or try and be VERY patient and keep losing/ winning until one of them offers an item. HOWEVER, even if they do offer one, if you lose your entire hand, or they lose theirs to someone ELSE, you won't get the item. Anyways, the main flaws are: Poor random choice in a few characters, overall game mechanics, and the lack of weapons in the game that actually have use, like stat-weapons like the Spy-cicle, and the only cool item you unlock (personally in my opinion) is the Enthusiast's Timepiece. What would have made this much better, is if all characters were always random TF2 characters, with them betting items more often (since the weapons won in the games go into your TF2 file). I wouldn't really recommend it, since the only main reason why I got the game (from a trade) was because I wanted the Timepiece watch because let's be honest here, who wouldn't want a SOLID GOLD invisibility watch, that has a symbol representing video games' most iconic character of all time, PAC-MAN!? Overall, 4/10.			"

												I originally bought it for the tf2 items, but then realized its actually a really fun game. Though i wasnt playing for fun until after i got the items since they can be hard to get if you dont have a good hand.Good:-Funny and entertaining dialogue between the characters-Free items! (that is, unless you bought this game solely for the items)-if you lose a game you can watch the rest of them finish it if you want to,and the best part? you get to see their hands!-You can unlock many tables and decks to customize your game (doesnt affect gameplay of course,but still cool.)-you get a little poker nickname after each win (or loss) depending on how much you have (or owe)Bad:- fresh dialogue seems to run out after about 2 hours and most lines repeat, though some new lines still pop up here and there.Tips:-If you are here for the items but dont want to play normal games, press Escape go to the menu and keep clicking new tournament, keep clicking it until somone doesnt throw money and throws an item in instead-if your playing a normal game try to knockout tycho first because trust me you DO NOT want to be alone at the table with tycho, he will put you through hell.Overall: Just a very fun game, especially for just 5$  "

Telltale Games did a great job of connecting each character with unique responses and can keep you in for a bit, since they added quite a bit of lines.There are free Poker games on the Internet, but this game is the only one with actual dramatic characters in it.

Anyways, if TF2 players want cosmetics play Poker Night 2. But collectors I reccomend this one, its awesome Suggestions if there is a Poker Night 3-Online-More Items-Longer -Make characters alternate games, like have 12 different ones but change every game, leading to more TF2 items.-Design your own character-Make him have a voice so you can talk back to those scumbags who ♥♥♥♥ you over alot (Ash)-Private Matchs (Poker with your friends!)

												I am an active player of Team Fortress 2 and I always saw players weilding these weapons like the Lugermorph or the Iron Curtain. But I never understood where they got these very nice items from. I decided to do some research on google because it bothered me a lot and found out about this game. I instantly bought it because I wanted to get the Lugermorph and show my friends because I thought it was a very cool pistol skin. I jumped right into the game, and I barely even know how to play poker or Texas hold 'em, but I had gotten the hang of it. I just kept restarting the game until Max, Strong Bad, Heavy, or Tycho to reveal one of  their items. But the first Item I got was the watch (Forgot what it was called). and soon after I got all of the other Items: ""Iron Curtain"", ""Lugermorph"" and ""Licence to Maim"", and lastly ""Dangeresque, Too?"" (the glasses). I opened up Team Fortress 2 and the game rewarded me with my Items. If you are an active Team Fortress 2 player like me I highly recommend this game to you. And I am also looking forward to ""Poker Night 2"" for any more items. So to sum up the entire review it is a very rewarding game and for a TF2 player looking for cool brand-new items to get this is the game! And also it is a fun poker game :)			"

												If you're just looking for a game that lets you practice playing poker, you could do a lot worse.But this game lets you play with some of your favourite characters from cartoons, games and comics.The game play is pretty straightforward, you choose the type of Poker you want to play, and get down to it.But if you pay attention to the characters and how they act, you can try and work out if they are bluffing, or trying to hide a good hand.Good replay value for the gameplay, but the comments from the other players can get repetitive after a while.Still, it will take a few games before you hear all the dialogue, and much of it gets a smile.

												This game's sense of style is intoxicating. Fifteen years ago, this would have been Multimedia Celebrity Poker, but today we get Poker Night at the Inventory. Life is good.Before the introduction was finished, I was sold on the setting of the Inventory. From the beautifully textured ""Kent Games & Amusements"" background on the statistics screen to the main characters' idle animations after they are eliminated from play, everything feels wonderfully authentic.Af far as the poker mechanics are concerned, I do notice that the AI makes an occasional check-raise or folds with everything but a few hundred chips in the pot. I'm sure these things detract from the game's potential as a training simulation, but as far as I'm concerned they don't detract from its overall playability.Definitely pick this up if you're interested in hanging out with a group of unique characters over a few hundred rounds of poker in a well-crafted and enigmatic setting.

												I'm gonna keep this one short;  it's a single player poker game with funny banter that wears out its welcome in 2-3 hours.  Is it worth a purchse for $5?  Short answer, Yes with an if.  Long answer no, with a but.If you are a fan of any of these characters, it's worth the asking price.  If you're not, then it's not.  It doesn't do anything revolutionary.  There is no multiplayer mode, no online, no other modes.  There are a healthy amount of unlocks and great dialogue and interaction, though it cycles through everything in 3-5 hours, depending on table composition.Check it out;  it's something to do while the game is on and worth a chuckle or three.

												Alright I'll just save everyone's sanity and keep the review of this game short. Poker Night at the Inventory is basically just a bog standard poker game with a couple of funny characters. Strong Bad, Max, Heavy and Tycho make some funny jokes along the way and it's almost enough to distract you from the game.Almost.The massive flaw with Poker Night at the Inventory is that it's only defining feature over any other poker game is the characters you play against. The game itself is a boring game of poker that becomes mind numbing very quickly. Buy this game on sale, read a guide that tells you how to get all the items and either refund it or uninstall it.

												Fanservice. This game is a big helping of fanservice; but who said fanservice was always a bad thing? The dialogue that goes on between the Heavy, Tycho, Max, and Strong Bad has a ""real"" quality to it. It's as if you really just joined a poker game with them. Fanservice aside, it's just a Texas Hold 'Em game. Only two difficulties (normal and hard) are present. However, there are a wide array of tables and card decks that are unlocked as you win games to spice things up a bit.  There are also unlockables for Team Fortress 2.  They don't have any special stats, but they do look nice. If you're not into poker or gambling, I'd pass this up. That being said, I do recommend it to anyone half-decent at card games or if you want the tf2 stuff. On a related note, the fanservice feel wears off after a little bit of gameplay (like a new car smell...strange analogy, but it works). Conversations will be repeated and it will lose that magic that captivated you in the first place. Ultimately, it's a decent poker game that's well worth the money.			"

It's willing to tell you interesting facts about how Texas Hold'Em was created but it will tell you jack ♥♥♥♥ about how to play it, what cards are bad or good, or even if there IS a way to be good at it. I actually had to look up online how the ♥♥♥♥ Texas Hold'Em works and there are very, very few explanations online that can give you a basic understanding of how this works. You just play the game and hope you win from my standpoint. While were at it let's make a game about Russian Roulette.			"

												I didn't know how to play poker, but its pretty easy. If you easily want to get the TF2 items follow my instructions, step one start a game (if there is no cutscene where one of the opponents throws in a item (NOT MONEY) return to menu and start a new game)once a opponent throws in a item wait there turn (if they fold you fold) (if they put money into the pot) you go all in, they should go all in too, you should have a big chance to get that item but if you lose the item try again, (rinse and repeat).Enjoy your TF2 items, and thank you for reading this review!

												Poker game that's not really about poker, but more about the characters talking and joking around. One of those games, where I don't mind starting it every now and then (or rather starting the second eposide as I already beaten what was to be beaten here and listened to most of the chit chat) just to have a round or two in the old Inventory.

												Diologs are funny, characters are funny, items are good and easy to get. I belive if you want the items you should go for it. But after while diologs are goin to be boring cause you will hear the same stuff ALOT ! Get the items, never play again, like me D:			"

												If you like playing porker you will like this game. One of the best features is that the characters you play against actually hold conversations, very fun just sitting there and listening to what they say.			"
