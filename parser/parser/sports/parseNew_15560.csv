												When I first started the game up, I was very sceptical of it. Everything from the name, the intro screen to the actual gameplay struck me as cheap and plain bad. I went through a few levels, the whole time thinking ""What the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing?"" and quit.I decided to jump back into the game again after I felt pretty bored. I started seeing a pattern, and I was actually enjoying the randomness of it all. I understood what hugs, kisses, thumbs ups and obscenities did. I was just dumbfounded when I saw that I got 2000 Teeth after a level, but then I figured out it's just basically points in order to unlock other levels. After that, I started getting a lot more into it.I passed most of the normal levels, when I noticed a button at the bottom of the screen, titled ""Awesome!!!"". So, I clicked on it, and another full page of levels popped up. The same as the regular ones, but here you unlock them by getting knees instead of teeth. Except, these ones were... pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ intense. Compared to the first levels, here you were falling at supersonic speeds, straining hard to concentrate on the mess of colors, patterns, beeps and clicks as you flew past the actually beautiful world. At first I thought it was a dumb game, very relaxed and easy, but boy, some of these levels are  tough! . I found myself more dedicated to passing a level than in any other game I've ever played, and I kept going for more!Overall, at first glance the game seems very bland and stupid and random. But it slowly starts taking up shape in your mind, making more and more sense. The real fun starts when you get good enough to start the ""Awesome!!!"" level pack, because some of the levels nearly caused adrenaline to seep out of my skin.I'd give this game a very strong 9/10, because it does take a bit of time to get used to the weirdness of it. But, trust me, once you get a bit more into it, the game really shines, and is insanely fun.			"

Addictive game about sky diving. Nice visuals, good soundtrack, well made game mechanics in which you are getting points for gliding close to the buildings and objects. "

												My nomination for ""Best use of gravity"" in the 2016 Steam Awards ;) This is a light-hearted quick-action title where risk meets reward as you base jump through a floating city, maneuvering through terraces and around buildings while trying to accumulate points. I think the developers did a wonderful job with this title.I suggest picking this game up when it goes on sale(for ~$2 or ~$3) as it is easily worth a night's great entertainment, especially when you or your friend are drunk off your♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Ever look over the edge of a tall building and hear that voice in the back of your head tell you ""... jump...""?This game seems like it's entire concept was constructed from that very principle, often called ""Lapelle Du Vide"" or ""Call of the void"" though with a comical twist to the whole idea. The goal is simple, jump from a VERY high altitude (some go as far as space), come close enough to buildings and objects that you ""kiss"" or ""hug"" them without suffering the ill effects of free-fall collision, and try to land safely. BTW, instead of earning coins or something, the main currency you use to unlock new levels is ""teeth""... I don't know why but it makes me just uneasy enough that I laugh every time I finish a level and it sais ""You've earned X number of teeth!""For those with vertigo or who have a fear of hights/falling, I don't reccomend this game as you'll probably find yourself reaching for a bucket every level. To everyone else, I absolutely reccomend this game.			"

												Holy crap. This game is super awesome. It's frustrating as hell--but it's one of those games where you don't mind dying 62 times on the same level, because it's just so damn fun. It's exhilarating and invigorating in a way that I forgot video/computer games could be.I don't know if anyone else had/will have the same experience I had, but on the off chance that it will help: Take the time to tweak the controls and settings. I wasn't crazy about the game until I played the tutorials several times with different settings to find what I liked. Once you hit the sweet spot, this game is like candy. Sweet, terminal velocity candy.Highly recommended. 9/10.			"

												This game isn't for me and I don't think I'll play it much, but I think a lot of people would enjoy it.The concept is that you're freefalling (BASE jumping) and you have to weave between buildings and platforms, falling as close to the walls as possible without touching them, to accrue maximum points. You also get to smash through score pads, gesture at fans, paint tag, and other such stuff. Then you need to nail the landing in a tight spot, deploying your parachute at just the right time to not break your bones.The skill in the game is to know which weaving path to take as you fall in order to maximise your points and be able to spend them on unlocking further levels. Which group of buildings has the longest walls, which score pads are the most valuable, which landing pad to aim for, etc.I would have liked the movement to be a little more responsive, but I understand that would defeat the purpose of the game.As usual with Dejobaan games, the music is a lot of fun and the game is imbued with a witty edgy mood.Playable with a controller, and that might be the better way to play it.

Title: AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the AwesomeGenre: Action, Indie, SportsDeveloper: Dejobaan Games, LLC Publisher: Dejobaan Games, LLC Release Date: 3 Sep, 2009Lets avoid those broken bones by not falling face first into a building, and remembering you have a parachute on your back.Gameplay Gotta stay close to those objects to get the hugs and kisses! A parachuting/base jumping game where you fall from high heights like the daredevil you are, avoiding buildings yet kind of sticking close to them for points until you hit the ground for points. You can do stunts and daring  falls – the idea behind it is pretty entertaining and stomach dropping if you've ever had the experience yourself of parachuting, since you can feel the buildings rushing past. The response in the game for your character is good, and the visuals are not hard to follow. There's nothing like flashy neon lights as your character plunges to their potential death because they really like jumping off high buildings.The controls are not adjustable which is bad for me as I use an azerty keyboard, the game is awkward to play smoothly like this. The settings are inflexible. I wouldn't mind an option to be able to change the controls to what I want.  Also the moment the game gets harder, I think it would be better to play it with a controller, rather than a keyboard. I don't like the layout of the pre game screens too much, though that's just down to personal taste. I think it looks a bit cluttered with the numerous squares/spinning squares, but the playable part of the game is addictive, plunging down those heights and trying not to accidentally splat myself on a building. I have to say I wasn't sure if I would like this, so I'm pleasantly surprised how addictive it is.I find the terminology/language of the game amusing. “Mash face against mountain.” “Collect teeth.” “No broken bones?” “You aren't dead! That's grand!” Small, witty one liners make me happy on the inside, I admit it. It's hard to play but rewarding for your progress. A game doesn't need to look amazing or be complex to be good. And there seems to be a lot of game time available,  and a lot of levels. I wouldn't keep playing it  continuously for hours, but I'm more than happy to go back to it and play it in-between other games, or for half an hour or so at a time. It's fast paced and lets you get stuck in almost straight away.What I find annoying is how far back a level/save point resets if you die, which can mean you have to refight tough monsters you already killed, and repeat a lot of content, which could make it stressful fast. Though there is a sense of achievement getting past those ANNOYING OBSTACLES.ProsLots of game time/content to get throughGood priceWitty one linersAddictive ConsNo adjustable settings/controls for a movement based gamePre game layout isn't so attractiveTL;DROverall VerdictI think it's worth the buy and play, as long as it's in a bundle or sale. There's enough here to keep you going for a while when you're bored with your other games. If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group! "

												Once I played the original version of this, I knew that Dejobaan are the chaotic neutral mad scientists of indie gaming (and that I love them for it). Frantic gameplay that requires that you plan things in order to get the best score, and some surprisingly well-done world building for such a relatively plotless piece (on top of the massive amount of stages for such a price). Overall, I'd recommend it, and it's my favorite Dejobaan game to date (with Drunken Robot Pornography being a close second).			"

YouTube™ Video: AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For the Awesome: Steam Backlog 

			Views: 304		

			AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For the Awesome: Steam Backlog We take a look at a slightly older game ""AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For the Awesome"", a game about jumping off buildings.		

Above is my video impressions of the gameAaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is an interesting game with some pretty simple mechanics. It's all about jumping off of buildings and accumulating as much points as possible. The game features a ton of levels and features to unlock, with some pretty eye catching aesthetics.The game is simple and that is both it's strength and weakness. It's easy to jump into and will grab player's attention very quickly, but because of it's extremely simple design, it could possibly lose the player's interest just as fast. It's really upto you to decide whether or not the game is worth your money.Pros:- Good looking- Easy to understand mechanics- Can be thrilling at timesCons:- Overly simple- Might not hold the attention of some players			"

												This Game is absolutly amazing, it totally understands what it is trying to do and does it perfectly. The only question is do you understand what it is trying to do?If you are wondering to yourself 'wait in these clips it seems like you could just go on the outside of these courses' the anwser is yes, yes you can. And have absolutly nothing in your way so you can master the movement without getting frustrated. Getting frustrated? THE GAME HAS A SOLUTION TO IT!!!!! It will go through breathing exersices with you to calm you down. This game does not take itself seriously it knows from moment 1 that it is made for fun and the challenge is there if you want it, but only if you want it. This game has a huge varitety making me reccomend it to casual gamers and Hardcore gamers because you can progress from level to level fairly easily for casual but if you want to 5-Star every level it will give you a good challenge. Getting the movement down to a useable level is really easilly but mastering it is really hard. I absolutly love this game from start to just leaving it in your library for every-once-in-awhile play.			"

You probably wont play for 2-3 hours nonstop but its really fun for the 20-30 min you will usually play. Oh and an important note  if you are afraid of heights this game is not for you as what you literally do in the game is jump off buildings and mountains etc. :)			"

												Date: January 28, early morning hours.Context: About to go go to bed.Cannot say too many positive things about this game.  It feels like the skydiving portions of Pilotwings without the charm and with a much more unintuitive control scheme.  If you're going to make a game about BASE jumping in which the only remotely challenging aspect of the jump is the landing, landing controls should not be 100% opaque and incomprehensible.  Also the music is unfathomably bad.  Basically, this game is a great representative of the early days of Steam, and its perceived success is owing to the fact that it was one of the first indie games out there, at least as far as I remember.  Difficult to recommend, unless you love aerial acrobatics and have an easy time figuring out controllers  Verdict: Immediate uninstall.			"

												While this game is a blast overall, it's even a greater experience in VR with its excellent Oculus Rift support since the days of the DK1, later adapted for the DK2 in full and updated regularly. I've actually gone as far as launching this game in VR during my work breaks. It's one of the best games to have a VR beginner try, as the feeling of falling is not only comfortable, but oddly relaxing and somewhat addicting over time.A great, challenging concept overall. Excellent sense of humor. Driving sound tracks. Prime time VR support. Much safer than actually jumping off buildings in a wingsuit.			"

												AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! ....For the Awesome, the Anti-Platformer!! In this game you will do all in your power to AVOID landing on them, as you leave every platform far behind!I nearly made a mistake with this game (beyond thinking the dreadful title actually said something about the game, that is): I read the reviews. Then I read the awards it's won. Then I considered the type of games I enjoy most: pinball, Puddle, FOTONICA. Flowing, limited control type games. Actually, the decision was easier with more information. And I made the correct one.WHAT  a game! While some call it ""boring and repetitive"" how can the possibilites of every building, tower, mountain in the UNIVERSE possibly be boring! People accustomed to absolute control, who have paid large sums to get games to perform in very precise ways, might not understand how gravity, and a body falling at very high speeds, are forces beyond simple control. They should play The Collider, a fine game with a similar basis. In THIS game you are being pulled by the force of an entire PLANET! Control must be earned, and learned....Basically, after completing some ridulously simple tutorials you are given a building to leap from. On the way down you gain points by coming close to objects, coming VERY close to objects, hitting score-coded, colored glass plates, and not smashing to boney, bloody bits. By succeeding, and obtaining enough points, you will reach awards of 1 to 5 stars. Each star pays off in ""teeth"", the currency used to unlock new levels, of which there are more than 80. Teeth can also be used to buy things like the ""flip-it"" glove, to either give a thumbs-up to fans, or the opposite to haters. Yes, of course, granting additional points. Once you have fallen as far as you feel is safe, a player opens their ""fins"" in order to glide safely to a smooth landing, possibly on a high-scoring smaller target. All movement is performed by mouse and the ubiquitous WASD keys (or controller.) But one must keep in mind that despite the availability of directional keys, a falling/floating body will ultimately move forward, to the exclusion of most other directions or intentions. One quickly learns the power of ""spiraling"".You may also unlock tongue-in-cheek ""relaxing meditations"" (for significantly lower prices,) or (so far) a cookie recipe from the strangest old, pseudo-cannibal lady ever. The purpose of spending teeth is not just new levels and objects, but access to yet more, since you must unlock an adjacent level before opening a new one on a tall, turning ""level drum"". Prices increase with progression, and only hints are given as to what will be found once a choice is made.There are also many bits of BASE jumping trivia, at no cost, basically to fill out he wall. A!FtA (for lack of better) does have achievements, but mostly for putting in the time, and only ten of them. Not a lot can be done to actively pursue them, other than sitting in a dark room, slowly wasting away. You know, the usual.IF this is your game, it is VERY much your game. A marvelous, funny AND fun game. So much fun as to not provoke the rage tendancies that will cause me to ""delete local content"" almost immediately. No two jumps are likely to be even remotely similar, since the distances fallen can be great. For me, it's almost as much fun to die as to win. Almost...(Like many Steam games, offline game time is ignored.)4tdc			"

I THREW...MYSELF...ON THE GROOOOUUUND !!!This game is extremely fun, not much to say...you jump off stuff and fall trying to avoid stuff that will break you like the little insect that you are, while trying to stay close to said stuff...yeah...if base jumping/gliding feels stupidly dangerous to you IRL, you'll love this game because you can have a small fraction of that and the ability to do it again if you fall to your worthless death...pu*sy.The music is great, the humor is good, I can't see why you wouldn't have fun with this title.Play this game with a controller, or joystick.I can only imagine how this game would feel on Occulus Rift...or even with a nice setup consisting of a good monitor/tv and a pro sound system :)			"

												A Puzzle game about a base jumping person. Or is it an adventure game. Or one of those arty farty indie 'life story' games about a suicidal person falling to their death and realising how thrilling life can really be when you do something spontanious. Cheered by the thrill of falling, and the daring of spraypaints and high fives from observers. No idea.What I do know is this game is a strange kind of fun. The idea is simple enough - fall from a great height and collect as many points as you can before you hit the bottom. Be daring and 'kiss' the lips of buildings, spray paint your logo wherever you can, wave to your fans are you plummett and make that soft landing. The more style you put into each trip to the bottom equals more money; more money equals more goodies and unlocks. Simples.There's a strange sort of anti-oppression narrative tacked in there too, for those who seek reason for madness. However, it's a lot more fun to just pick up and play this game in small bursts. Long play throughs will probably lead to burn out. No joke.That's not to say that this game doesn't have it's frustrating moments, but that's more to do with the game's levels and ramping difficulty rather than any ill-fated design decision or game breaking bug. So, if you're looking for a 'pick up and play' kind of game that can fill a 10-20 minute gap here and there then I do believe 'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome' could be the game you're looking for.It often goes cheap in the various Steam Sales too, so there's always that if you're really unsure about picking it up.

												Welcome to the first ever falling simulator that ive ever seen. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a real good time but others may have a different opinion. For what you pay this game is very basic allowing you simply to fall while avoiding obsticles with the more risk you take earning you more points.  You start with only a handful of maps to choose from but you have to earn points to spend unlocking other maps.  This leads to alot of repetition just to allow yourself access to more repetition. The cost is made up for by the number of maps you can unlock as the game progresses but I dont find that to be all that worth it.			"

The game really comes into its own once you have got competent at all the basics and played most of the basic mode levels then charge in to the 'awesome' mode which is much faster and honestly even more fun. Just like in real life, hugs and kisses are very moreish, and in the week I've been playing it I keep wanting to come back to it for about an hour at a time.

												Really awesome and fun game where the player freefalls through an obstacle course and attempts to rack up as high a score as possible. Gain points by getting close to buildings, gesturing at spectators, and various other stunts. The highest scoring paths are usually the most risky, so be careful not to crash and die :) This is one of those concepts that is easy to learn, but difficult to master. There are endless hours of fun, trying to get high scores on over 100 maps. Graphics are simple but effective, and the music adds to the intensity. The low purchase price is great value for money.

												Buy this if you think Microsoft Excel is too exciting for you.Seriously, very sorry to say, but I think it's an absolutely horrendous game. Zero excitement. Zero. Bad graphics (worse than many cell phones today). Zero thrill. Insanely boring. Gameplay goes like this: -> you walk (more like slowly inching your way) off a ""building"" -> you ""fall"" (more like slowly drift) towards something supposed to be downwards -> you steer clear of stuff (big blocks/pixels) on your way down, and try to hit various targets on the way down etc. -> you deploy your ""chute"" (which is stated to be a helicopter-thingy?) and land -> repeat ad naseum.No render of a ground or imminent dangers. Just blocks and stuff magically hovering in mid-air on your way down. No resemblance to an actual base-jump, or parachute-jump for that matter, whatsoever. You can unlock different places to ""jump"". Why not make it go fast, like a real jump? Why not add the whooshing sound of air, or add the instability from the air resistance that rushing towards the ground gives you? Why no content or graphics? Why doesn't anything look like real buildings, or real persons, or anything real? I've tried countless games, in a broad spectre of genres, all the way from the Sinclair ZX and Commodore in the 80s, but this really burns itself on the retina and memory as a really, really bad gaming experience.I will, however, not tell you how this game is with Oculus Rift, because I haven't tried it. Maybe it's better? Could be. Seriously, it could be. Maybe the VR-goggles can transform crap to tolerable.Personally, I doubt it. But hey, each to his own.			"

 Gets game in Humble Bundle: waits a year to try it. Takes longer to install than to get bored of. Simply, the game is just repetitive and not that fun. It feels oddly slow for a game where you freefall, and it's not satisfying to play. Nothing about this game is special; it feels like they just ripped off the skydiving from Pilotwings and tried to make it their own. The difference is that Pilotwings is a better game. "

												Interesting idea for a game but it gets boring pretty fast. You fall fairly slowly so it really isn't too exciting. I like the sense of humor in the game but it's not enough to keep my attention.			"

												As I'm typing this review, I literally just realized that the ""A's"" on the title aren't completely at random, they have a pattern. And that's pretty awesome. You know what else is awesome? This game.	""AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome"" is a Base Jumping Simulator developed by Dejobaan Games and Owlchemy Labs, and it has an awesome sense of humor. You may have noticed how much I've used the word ""awesome"" outside of the title. That's because it is the best word to describe this game. It's not beautiful, it's not revolutionary, it's not unforgettable, it's just awesome. You know the ""Awesome"" smiley face that you see on the internet every once in a while? Yeah, that kind of awesome. But exactly why is this game awesome? Let's take a closer look.	First of all, this game has no story. At all. There is no main character; the game is in first-person so it looks like the person jumping is you! Why are you jumping? I don't know, because it's awesome, maybe? Is there some kind of hidden lore that I'm missing? Probably not, and if there is, it's VERY well hidden.	The presentation of this game is decent. There are no real characters in this game, meaning that there are no 3D models of any creature. So what we can judge is the buildings and structures that you'll be falling dangerously close to (or on to). The great majority of the shapes that you will see in this game are rather basic. Buildings are rectangles; there's some rings here and there; most platforms are squares; etc. Really, the most complex-looking model that you're going to see in this game are mountains. The textures are not impressive or super-detailed, either. The Heads-Up Display isn't anything spectacular or admiring to look at. And actually, it's OK for this game in particular to not look like it was made by Square Enix. Because you're constantly falling non-stop, you will never have time to take an in-depth look at all the objects in the levels. Honestly, it's better that way, because it won't distract you from trying not to fall to your doom. So in short, this game looks simplistic; it looks as good as it needs to look.	OK, here's the important one: the gameplay. In ""Aaaaa! for the Awesome"" (that's the short way to say it), the goal is to jump off the building at which the levels starts you on and reach the bottom while making as many points as possible. In order to gain points, you must ""fly near stuff"" as the game says, which will earn you ""Hugs"" and ""Kisses."" Early on in the game, you will gain the ability to thumbs-up your fans, flip-off angry mobs, and spray municipal buildings with graffiti. A lot of levels also have breakable score plates and special plates that may or may not help you. The controls only consist of 4 keys on the keyboard and the mouse, and it does support a gamepad. But due to the game's simple controls, I don't find a gamepad necessary; the mouse and keyboard work just fine. Whenever you complete a level, you will gain a certain amount of Teeth and Kneecaps based on your score, and you can use these to unlock other levels. Now that I explained the gameplay, how enjoyable was it? Well, the game is fun. The slight feeling of vertigo that you get from falling thousands of meters in the air is pretty exciting. Despite how dangerous and realistically stupid of an idea it might be, you will always want to ""fly near stuff"" as much as possible to ensure that you get the highest score, and for those who are competitive, you will probably try one level several times until you see 5 / 5 stars with a huge score sitting beside it. As you progress, the levels will become increasingly more challenging, though I don't believe the game ever got to a point where I just wanted to rip my hair off. But the game is not perfect, however. It is simple and easy-to-learn, but I personally didn't find ""Aaaaa! for the Awesome"" to be noticeably addicting. If you want to beat the game in one sitting, you can probably do it in 3 - 4 hours, but it will start feeling repetitive and tedious after about an hour of playing. It's also worth noting that the game will not tell you your score until you finish or fail the level. But probably the biggest problem with this game is the lack of a level editor (at least there isn't one as far as I'm aware). The game offers 81 levels, and that's... sufficient, but I feel like this game could benefit SO much from User-Generated Content! I don't know if the developers are still willing to work with this game, but if they ever come back to it, please add a level editor. But as it stands, ""Aaaaa! for the Awesome"" can be a fun game if played in short bursts, but I wouldn't advice binge playing it.	I guess let's talk about sound design for a bit. The game offers a techno-rock soundtrack that fits the general mood and style of the game, but it's not something that I may have a MIGHTY NEED to put on my MP3 player. There are actually a few pieces of voice acting in the game; the two you will hear the most is a man and a woman telling you how many Hugs and Kisses you have. There's also some videos narrated by the developers, and these videos will either be tutorials or talking about random things because yes. Oh, and let's not forget about Kevin... with the news. As far as sound effects go, I think they're mostly stock sounds of angry mobs, cheering, and hitting things. I do think they could have done a better job with those sound effects, particularly when you fall and break every bone in your body. The game tells you that you just broke everything, but it doesn't sound like it.	So all in all, what do I think about ""Aaaaa! for the Awesome?"" It's definitely a fun game that does everything that it does good enough, but it's nothing mind-blowing. It knows what it wants to be, and tries to be nothing more. If you like awesome stuff, you'll like this game. And with the added support for Virtual Reality, it makes the game even better for those who own a VR device, though unfortunately that number isn't too high. Mind you, I'm a cheap booger, so I got this game from I believe a Humble Indie Bundle because I wouldn't pay $10 for it. But if you think this game is perfect for you (and specially if you own a VR device), go for it.			"

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221Short review for a short, but still.....sigh......awesome......game.Gameplay:  Skydiving gameplay.  WAY more awesome than it seems, and it already seems pretty awesome.  The game is fast and erratic, all while being fair and pretty easy to control.  Just like real skydiving!  Also just like in real skydiving, you get more points the closer you are to buildings and objects you fall next to.  Can get pretty intense in some of the more difficult and faster levels.  Real life flipping people off simulator as well!  Graphics: ...good?  I guess it's pretty good.  It's all just geometrical shapes with varying color palettes.  So yeah....good?Sound:  The music in this game is actually and suprisingly top notch.  Fits very well with the extreme sports genre.  Some of the ""awesome"" tracks are especially well suited for this game.  Oh, and nothing like hearing that constant beeping when scoring hugs, and knowing that your score is skyrocketing.Replayability:  Lots of levels.  If you want five stars, you're REALLY going to be playing this one for a very long time.  And much respect to you.TL:DR Great game.  Buy it on sale.  Aim for the birds.  No ragrets.			"

												I'm not even about to include the name of this game in this review. Nope, not even copy-pasting it.Base-jumping in a surreal setting can only become fun when the game-feel is right. Does it feeel like you're falling at 9.8 m/s^2? Does it feel like wind is blowing through your button on windbreaker pants? Does it feel like you're actually deploying and controlling a parachute down to your landing? Yes, yes, yes and no. The game is reminiscent of sonic the hedgehog in a way, it's super fast and agile (movement wise), level based ,and very heavily emphasizes ""points"". The humor in the game is very smartass but in a way that feels like they're being a smartass with you rather than towards you, and its honestly one of the better parts of the game itself. The amount of variety in the levels as well as different routes through the levels give the game some solid replayability while you go back through and try to get higher scores on levels you've maybe passed up too fast. It is very hard to 5 star every level and so eventually, you will hit a brick wall where you can't finish buying all of the levels because you've run out of points and run out of levels to earn more points. It's really fun when you get into it, until it starts getting tedious. I could see this game being more fun with friends (actual friends in person, with a game controller, passing it around), but alone, I can only play in 10~15 minute bursts.Overall: 6.5/10			"

												This is a very fun game, fast paced and designed with lots of different elements to keep things interesting.  It's a great distraction because it is a good challenge, and it seems that there are hundreds of levels and since no two jumps are the same on any level, it is vast as well.			"

												I have put yes to recommending this, but beware, motion sickness. You don't know it while playing, but after you shut it down and go to bed, or whatever, I felt extremely sick, like projectile vomiting all over the room. But it's a pretty neat concept. If they added a kind of visual effect to simulate the speed of freefalling, it would of been even better. As it is, you kind of just float down.			"

												I'm not even about to include the name of this game in this review. Nope, not even copy-pasting it.Base-jumping in a surreal setting can only become fun when the game-feel is right. Does it feeel like you're falling at 9.8 m/s^2? Does it feel like wind is blowing through your button on windbreaker pants? Does it feel like you're actually deploying and controlling a parachute down to your landing? Yes, yes, yes and no. The game is reminiscent of sonic the hedgehog in a way, it's super fast and agile (movement wise), level based ,and very heavily emphasizes ""points"". The humor in the game is very smartass but in a way that feels like they're being a smartass with you rather than towards you, and its honestly one of the better parts of the game itself. The amount of variety in the levels as well as different routes through the levels give the game some solid replayability while you go back through and try to get higher scores on levels you've maybe passed up too fast. It is very hard to 5 star every level and so eventually, you will hit a brick wall where you can't finish buying all of the levels because you've run out of points and run out of levels to earn more points. It's really fun when you get into it, until it starts getting tedious. I could see this game being more fun with friends (actual friends in person, with a game controller, passing it around), but alone, I can only play in 10~15 minute bursts.Overall: 6.5/10			"

												Let's pretend for a moment that you want to make a video game.  Let's also pretend that you don't have any 3d modeling or artistic ability whatsoever.  How do you resolve a conundrum like that?  Simple: abstract art!This is the approach that the developers of AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome took when developing their base jumping simulator.  There's a certain edge to the game, certainly, and it's got some style, but I just can't get over the fact that it'd be a lot more fun if the buildings I was flying past at high speeds looked like actual buildings.Also, the buildings float, because this is the future.  And because this is the future, base jumping is obviously now the way that you're going to take down the evil authoritarian government that somehow took over.  Presumably you're angry because of the flying buildings...who knows?Still, it's fun for a bit as a sort of combination racing/puzzle game.			"

												AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! is a game about base-jumping and high-score chasing. Each of the game's levels start with you falling off a building suspended in mid-air, and plummeting to the ground below, smashing glass plates and skirting close to skyscrapers and other mid-air debris for ""kisses"" and ""hugs"", which translate into more points at the end of the level. If you crash, you're forced to start over from the beginning of the jump (or more rarely, a mid-level checkpoint). As you progress through the game, you're presented with more ways to score points, from waving to fans/flipping off angry protesters to marking anti-establishment graffiti on marked buildings. Once you reach the colored landing markers near the bottom of the level, you activate your propeller wings and land safely, hopefully langing in designated zones for yet more bonus points. All this is presented alongside odd, dystopian-flavored humor in the form of 'radio broadcasts' heard on the stage select screen. Aaaaa! For The Awesome, in addition to content from original title, also ships with additional levels where your character falls at twice the rate, for added challenge.At the current asking price of $10, this game is definitely worth it if you ever enjoyed seeing how far you could fall without dying in World of Warcraft or similar, and wanted to compete with complete strangers on a coreboard to see who could do it the best. Even if you didn't want to do the latter part, it's still worth a run. Or, indeed, a jump.			"

												Absolutely bursting with character. I wasn't sure whether I would enjoy this or not, but then I jumped off a building, and unlike in real life, where the end result is an unfortunate mess and a prime spot in the local obituary (or if you made a loud noise, the local paper front page), I found the whole experience to be absolutely thrilling.It's a lovely example of a unique concept polished well, and given its own crazy personality to compliment the whole thing. Perfect little time waster, with some quite complex manouvres required for perfection, lending itself both to beginner building jumpers, and expert exo-base jumpers alike.Really, there isn't quite a game like it, it's good.

												I can't tell you how much fun it is to jump off a building(?) and 'base-fly' jump. The speeds are well executed by the game It all seems very realistic, and no broken bones. I am terrified of heights and this was a big shock, so if you are also, get ready for some fun if you can stand taking that first step off.			"

												AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome played for 2 hours first impressions.AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is actually 2 games in one. The original game which is all the 'A's and the sequal which is called Awesome. It's a shame really as I was hoping to do a really crappy pun about the noise you will make when playing it. Actually it turns out that pun is pretty accurate as you will be saying both playing it :)Before I start talking about this game I just want to let you guys know that I am not really the best person to talk about sports games. I don't really like sports and I tend to find the games equally as tedious. However there have been a couple of exceptions over the years and this is thankfully one of them. I think I've realised what it is now. The last sports game I really enjoyed was Mario Golf. I find Golf a bit of a mind blowing game, the only enjoyable thing I can think of is that its a nice walk on a pleasant day, but to watch it on tv is something I've never been able to understand, but like this game mario golf adds a lot of fun nice extras and it provides enough of a distraction. A for the A is similar. While you are jumping to possibly your death there are many things you can do. Your character will thumbs up any fans watching and make naughty gestures to those who protest, you get additional points for being a wreckless moron with a death wish by scraping your chin against buildings as you fall and you can spray graffiti too. Wait how does that even work? Never mind. You can also slam through glass plates for extra points. At the end you deploy your parachute and try to land in a small circle for bonus points which is a lot harder than it sounds as the parachute controlls terribly. Then you are graded, usually very poorly.Holy crap is it hard though! You will find many hours of gameplay in this if its the kind of thing that you enjoy. I'm sure if you search youtube you will see people raging about it. You need to gain a high grade in order to gain teeth which is the in game currency to unlock the next level. However you only get teeth for gaining a better rank so there is a lot of grind. I have heard people complain that it is repetitive but it's a sporty game, of course its repetitive. This game has a great sense of humour too, it is full of comedic parts and although a lot of it didn't work for me it's nice to see them there.So after this positive review why am I not recommending it? Well...I feel bad for not doing so but the trouble is when I think about my friend circle, I can't think of anyone who would like it. It's something that I feel you should take a look at but it would require a lot of dedication to keep playing through it. The difficulty is incredibly high, and just because its hard doesn't make it negative is a rule I live by, but this is almost trapformer hard, I can see people getting really angry at it. It is kinda funny but it's a bit samey and the parachute controls will really wind you up. I understand why they made that part difficult but if you are falling for 4 5 maybe 6 minutes and you miss the circle by a pixel then you will be tearing your hair out. I think this might be the sort of thing that works better on the tablet and indeed there is a tablet version, this seems to be the sort of thing you try and master slowly over several months while you are multitasking in the bathroom. This game feels a little bit in the wrong era. If we were still in the ""xtreme"" 90s it may have fit in a little better. Of course if you enjoy base jumping in real life (you crazy madman!) then feel free to ignore all of this and play your heart out!I see this game being absolutely perfect for its niche, like I say, the completionist extreme sports fan will gleefully be able to spend hours and hours maxing out everything this game has to offer, and good luck to him!I bet its freaking awesome with the occulus though! If I ever get one I will promise to rewrite this review!			"

												Break a few laws in a virtual world and have lots of fun doing it! It's like GTA except not really and there is a lot more falling and (probably) breaking your neck/legs/arms/everything. There are a lot of levels to play and there are random entertaining videos that you can unlock in between all the falling. It's a dollar on the humble bundle at the moment, so what have you got to lose? (Besides a dollar).			"

												First of all I want to say as for an INDI Game thank GOD that this game came in a HumbleBundle  and I didn’t have to pay for it. When I first looked at this game I though, oooo a free fall game might be cool but is like SLOW MOTION FALLING. To be honest I played it for about 5 minutes you might think, obviously not enough time to judge a game. Well ♥♥♥♥ it the game is bad I give it 13/100.			"

												First things first, I absolutely love the music. I left the game up for 30 minutes, just to listen to the music. Maybe its just me, but I loved it. Second fact, this is your typical 'fall and avoid things in way' type game. That being said, the graphics are out of date, the controls are not very precise, and the features, are limited at best. That being said, it is perhaps the best money (I think I got it in a humble bundle, not sure) I have spent. I can't explain why it is, maybe its the constant humor that actually is funny, or the raw challenge, unlike other fall type games that has drawn me to this game.			"

												This is one of those games that is so funny/quirky that it's impossible to write a funny/quirky recommendation. Really all I can do is quote the game's intro: ""In the year of our Lord, nineteen eighty two, polystructures fell from space. Massive but light, they touched the atmosphere, and stuck.Scientists made new materials. Builders made new cities. Families made their homes thousands of feet above ground level. Art made the floating super-sculptures, and culture made the floating caviar socials to regard them.In the year of our Lord, twenty eleven, you cannot look up from beneath a city and see the stars.But you can look down from above it. And you can jump.The jumps you make are not about art. They are about a reckless disregard for safety.The jumps you make are not about culture. They are about a reckless disregard for regulation.The jumps you make are not about science. They are about a reckless disregard for gravity.""And that's the least nutty part of the game.			"

												Even though Im not good at this game I love it!! Its got a whimiscal  take on those first Skydiving games on older phones, pre smartphone not old smartphones, where you had to fall through hoops to get points. Here you get to fall through flosting buildings, weave in and out of tight spots, and then land. The gameplay is lots of fun and the movement controls are a bit slow, I kind of wish they could be a litle more crisp especially for weaving through the tight spots, but the game was designed to emulate skydiving, so its not really a big surprise. Pros: Simple controls; Its a fun gameCons: The movement feels slow to me, but i am NOT good at this game;For me this game is really fun i would recommend buying this game on sale as 10$ is a little pricey in my books for this kind of game, but then again i am a pretty frugal person, but this game is totally worth a look when its on sale, since you can usually get all of Dejoban games in a collection for super cheap.

Tell them what you think. ;)  The humour is everywhere (as you complete levels, you gain teeth, which are in turn used to buy levels, the abilities you can use, and some joke videos (they're pretty inventive).I'd advise anyone looking for something cheap and decent to go for it.  The Awesome add-on adds some tougher levels to this, and expands the story (yes, there is a story of sorts).			"

Seriously makes me envious of people with an Occulus Rift, since this game runs Occulus Rift.Excellent game play, looks beautiful, great soundtrack, and it doesn't hold your hand one bit.  Just shows you how the game works and thrusts you in!The only gripe I have with it, is the parachute controls, since I have died many times trying to land by steering with the mouse, and then going off site and breaking every bone in my body.Despite the parachute controls, this game controls flawlessly.  I would highly recommend for any indie-game enthusiast, and even people who have wanted to base-jump.10/10!			"

												Brilliant indie game all about base jumping! Set in a distopian future where some very large blocks have fallen out of the sky and remain suspended there, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is all about the subculture of jumpers, people who jump off these giant buildings in the sky.AAAA--♥♥♥♥ it not typing that all again--is the first Aaaa game with a sizable expansion, more stable controls (slightly), and a slight graphics update. It is certainly a great game worth every penny.			"

												I love this game! It is very well optimised, even for my low power machine, running at quite an acceptable level on simple graphics. The mechanics and level design is amazing, adrenaline pumping twists and turns, bear hugs, invulns, speed-ups and slow-downs are all the new mechanics here. The little ""news strips"" in the level selection screen is witty and makes me chuckle. And the music! The music is fantastic! There is one track that makes me feel like james bond, another that makes me feel like sonic. The flip it glove is always fun to use, and the graffiti mechanics are very fun, if not a bit difficult to get close enough to the building. In short: Pros: +fantastic music+ great optimisation+ Linux!+ witty storytelling+ great level designCons: - Graffiti mechanic hard to use- limited options- relatively steep learning curve- confusing level selection screen - at least for newbiesBut still, i would definetly reccomend this for you or for any other person as a gift.

Once you work out how to navigate the menus, you must search through tons of locked levels that aren't sorted at all in order to find the starter tutorial levels, mixed in with random facts that are just in the way of gameplay and clutter everything.The way the game was executed is too complicated for it's own good, despite the idea behind it (falling) should be simple.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!the only reason I didn't refund this game is so I could write a review for it. This is the worst game on the face of the planet. The bugs are so bad you can't even play it. So... ♥♥♥♥ing... bad... This is the first bad review I've done and I will change if the dev's fix it. Have posted on forums, with other people joining in having similar, stupid♥♥♥♥♥issues. At first the devs made a joke about it, then they said they're working on it... a month and a half later nothing. Crap developers making crappy games that shouldn't be on steam. Anyone who posts a positive review of this game is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing moron.http://steamcommunity.com/app/15560/discussions/0/616189106706421199/And the link they removed is to the steam discussion I had with the problems that they can't or refuse to fix. Ya... real professinal. Anything that doesn't look good for them, censor all they can. Look up mouse sensitivity and input issues in the forums. Don't let them hide behind lies. Oh and all the comments on this, and people rating negative reviews as unhelpful, it's all the company's cronies doing it. Scam upon scandal. Be wary			"

												I received this off humble bundle. It's a very interesting game. Basically, the game simulates you falling off a building, and you have to make it to your target without hitting other parts of the building. To be honest, I found the game quite offensive due to the nature of falling out of buildings. I felt really scared once I jumped off and I thought it was real for a second. I don't recommend this game if you have vertigo, which I have. I rate it 9 out of 11.			"

												I know some people are going to think I'm crazy, but this is a pretty good game. Normally, Dejobaan games aren't really all that good (to put it nicely), but AAAAA manages to not suck. Its gameplay is very simple; fall down a floating city, collecting points and buzzing towers for bonuses, and trying to land without breaking all your bones. More complexities are added, like bystanders and tagging certain buildings, but it never becomes too complicated to enjoy. It's dumb, it's simple, and it's good for just zoning out and playing something. I'd recommend getting this on sale, but you should definitely check it out.			"

												Aaaaaa.....AAA!!! for the Awesome is not quite as grand as the name implies.The premise of the game is base jumping and attempting to perform some flashy ""stunts"" in the process, mostly consisting of falling near the walls to earn ""kisses"" and ""hugs"", as well as to show off to the crowds with such crazy things as ""thumbs up"".  The game definitely does not take itself seriously, which is perhaps the best thing about it.  I would have disliked it much more if there was the sense of self-importance that many indie games are saddled with these days.That said, I still cannot recommend this, purely due to the repetitive nature.  Perform a jump, earn ""teeth"" or ""kneecaps"", unlock a new jump, repeat.  The levels are different, but they don't seem to be all that different.  They are mostly stylized falls around buildings that could not exist in the real world, and that leads to the levels all having a very ""been there, done that"" feel to them even early in the game.The controls aren't horrible but aren't great either.  There seems to be something about pulling the chute and landing that is very intuitive to some players, and horribly counter-intuitive to others.  I'm not sure why there is this disconnect, but I know that guiding myself after pulling the ripcord felt more frustrating than trying to carefully skim along the edge of buildings that are staggered back and forth at high speed, and I still don't think I really understand how landing was supposed to work.  It should not take more than a half hour of gameplay to have a feel for what is a vital part of the game- after all, an improper landing gets you no stars, and no teeth to unlock another level with.Now, if you happen to have an Occulus and can go full VR with it, I could see this game having much more appeal.  Maybe there is something missing playing on a regular monitor, when there is no real sense of falling (there is no ground that you can fall ""to"", and the field of view is pretty restricted with the random floating structures around you anyway). I assumed the game would be pretty fast paced, what with the idea of falling at terminal velocity and all, but it doesn't quite achieve that either.   "

												Fantastic game! I used to get up every morning and drink coffee and play for 20-40 before work. So much adrenaline!Pros: Tons of levels (so many it'll take 10+hours and hours to unlock them all)The game starts off a little ""easy"" but ramps up in intensity at a very good paceTons of neat musicWeird♥♥♥♥♥relaxation tapes scattered around to help you ""chill out"" (and they actually work)FULL of weird punny/awkward things. I genuinely laughed pretty hard at someYou can base jump from space! On the idea that we learned how to build on airYou get ""bones and teeth"" from passing stages to unlock more stagesEveryone in the world needs more ""Hug's and Kisses""Cons:Breaking every single bone in your bodyI somehow lost all my progress (all my ""currency"" and unlocked levels) when I switched computers and I didn't play AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome for about 6 months. It only happened once and has been fine for a year or two now. I actually enjoyed unlocking all the levels again! I just miss the crazy hard trippy levels that were hard to get to. The music, the fun graphics, free falling from space, whizzing back and forth avoiding flying cars and electric cables ect.... This game is the whole package of ""cool""11/10 I love this game. I still boot it up and enjoy it immensely. I've never played a game like this.  "

												One of my favourite indie games. The levels are freaking hard, and you can be lose often, but they are very addictive that you feel want to repeat over and over again. I can stay playing one level for 1 hour to beat the level.A great buy if you want a challenging and adrenaline-pumping game experience, but I think this game is not for everyone because of its difficulties.

												Hmm hmm. What to say about this game. The negative is basically meaningless 'cause I'm just really ""meh"" on this one. I don't hate it and it can be entertaining but it's not that compelling or deep and rather reptetive after a while.The visuals are kind of bland, for one. Funny, right, unique, but still very bland. I liked Drunken Robot Pornography's aesthetic a lot, but this game is just not as interesting visually. Musically the songs are all okay I guess? I guess. There's basically no plot except for a radio announcer guy who I ignored after the fourth or so time he appeared because just kidding there's no plot. Yeah, ehh.The gameplay itself is a more arcade-y score-attack type of thing, which is fine, but not my kind of gameplay. I'd rather the game be about completing hard levels than completing a lot of easy-to-average levels really well. Progressing in the game isn't hard but I have no drive to sink in the time it would take to 5* everything, at all. The controls tend to be decent enough though a bit sluggish-feeling, and the parachute mechanic is kind of trash, but it's all fine on a basic level. There's just too much of it with too little variety. I didn't even finish the main game levels (all the added ones though, which at least were decently interesting and more varied).I mean yeah, if that kind if gameplay is your thing, go for it I'd say. It's not really my thing. So I can't review it positively. EHH.			"

												Pretty fun game. It is a novel idea of base jumping, and the game is certainly not easy, but the levels are tough in a fun way. The developers released some new free levels, and the opening message about the developers changing every time was funny and original, plus you gotta love the owl for the symbol. There is a lot of fun to be had while flying down at amazing speeds narrowly missing things and fitting into tight holes (yes, that's what she said, I know you were thinking it). It has that exhilirating feeling when you go so fast you can barely keep up, you sometimes get the actual feeling with a little feeling in your stomach that sometimes goes into your♥♥♥♥♥♥balls (guys you know what I'm talking about). So why am I giving the game a down vote, for a few reasons. First off, although the idea is fun at first, it can be very repetitive because you literally just base jump for the entirety of the game, which isn't that short. It can start to become mundane because you're doing the same thing for the 100th time. Also, most levels are the exact same, with the same buildings and obstacles. More variety of where you are jumping would be nice. There are a few with rocks and a mountain, as well as a giant pipe, but for the most part the levels were interchangeable, which doesn't help with the repetition. More thought could have been put into level design. Also the few things that can add something to do (tagging buildings and giving thumb signals) stay the same throughout, so even after they are introduced in the first few levels, you never gain anything else to do, which once again adds to the monotony. Some other things to do would be nice. Also the tagging and thumb signals aren't very accurate and you can look at things and press the button and it won't count, and the game doesn't give you a good enough indication whether or not you actually got it. They are a little too finnicky sometimes, and could have been polished more. Now for the worst problem. Although I am fine with having high scores and points, it should be for people that want to get leaderboards and want to replay a game. In this game, your star rating gets you stuff you have to use to unlock levels. This is fine for a while but then newer levels cost more than if you get a 5 star on a single level, which makes no sense. I got mostly 4-5 stars on all the levels, with some 3s, and only a very few 1-2s, and I couldnt afford to play about 10 levels. It seems so stupid that a developer would make something and make it soo inaccessible. You should not be decided to play more of the game based on a random score or time the developer chooses for you. That is what the leaderboards and other things are for the idiots that wanna keep replaying a level to get as high of a score as possible. I don't want to have to keep repeating every level till I get 5 stars just to be able to play more, because if thats the case then why include 1-4 stars, it's just stupid. FORCED did it too with challenges and SMB did it with secret hidding bandages and level speed run times. It is such a dumb and lazy concept used to force replay value on those that don't want it. They fix it with the added hard levels (what does it say that hard levels it the value you get and cost of new levels is MORE fair and balanced than regular levels). There are a ton of levels though, so good for them. But since I cannot finish the game because of stupid game design I cannot fully endorse the game. 5.5/10.			"

Also the few things that can add something to do (tagging buildings and giving thumb signals) stay the same throughout, so even after they are introduced in the first few levels, you never gain anything else to do, which once again adds to the monotony. Some other things to do would be nice. Also the tagging and thumb signals aren't very accurate and you can look at things and press the button and it won't count, and the game doesn't give you a good enough indication whether or not you actually got it. They are a little too finnicky sometimes, and could have been polished more. Now for the worst problem. Although I am fine with having high scores and points, it should be for people that want to get leaderboards and want to replay a game. In this game, your star rating gets you stuff you have to use to unlock levels. This is fine for a while but then newer levels cost more than if you get a 5 star on a single level, which makes no sense. I got mostly 4-5 stars on all the levels, with some 3s, and only a very few 1-2s, and I couldnt afford to play about 10 levels. It seems so stupid that a developer would make something and make it soo inaccessible. You should not be decided to play more of the game based on a random score or time the developer chooses for you. That is what the leaderboards and other things are for the idiots that wanna keep replaying a level to get as high of a score as possible. I don't want to have to keep repeating every level till I get 5 stars just to be able to play more, because if thats the case then why include 1-4 stars, it's just stupid. FORCED did it too with challenges and SMB did it with secret hidding bandages and level speed run times. It is such a dumb and lazy concept used to force replay value on those that don't want it. They fix it with the added hard levels (what does it say that hard levels it the value you get and cost of new levels is MORE fair and balanced than regular levels). There are a ton of levels though, so good for them. But since I cannot finish the game because of stupid game design I cannot fully endorse the game. 5.5/10.			"

												This game is awesome, just like it says. It's an adrenaline rush, and it's stupidly fun.It's completely random at times, but the actual gameplay has stunning graphics and great background music. So far no bugs. The controls are fairly good, sometimes they can be tricky when you have to wasd-ctrl-leftclick-rightclick-space all at once, but that doesn't come up often enough to be annoying. Just enough to be challenging.Don't take it too seriously, get past the tutorials and into the fun.Should bear a motion-sickness and epilepsy warning though. Also, turn down the volume before you start, or you might get a nice headphone-blast in the beginning.Totally worth it. I have no regrets.			"

												So this isn't really a huge leap from the previous one as far as I can tell. Take it with a grain of salt, I only played just a few minutes and didn't feel like I needed to delve too far into it. The biggest improvement I could see was the hit box was shrunk and VR support was added. How many of you actually have a VR device yet? Exactly, neither does anyone else. But the hitbox improvement means you can really thread the needle that much better.Much of the look is the same though: menus, geometry, effects, pretty much everything. The only difference here is what appears to be newer and more interesting shaders. All-in-all, it's the same as before, and that's a little disappointing. I still recommend it because at it's core, it's fun. However, if you already bought the first one, you might want to wait for this one on sale, or just skip it altogether (unless you really want that VR support). If you didn't get the first one, then this is an easy buy.			"

												This game is good. Yes, not great but good. It's very hard to screw up a game where you just fall past things and then POW, end of stage. Is it any fun? Hell yeah. Falling and avoiding stuff is kinda fun. Is it repetitive? Hell yeah. Once you fall past the first building, you've basicaly seen everything. It all comes down to: ""are you a persone with OCD who wants to get the best possible highest score?"" If that's the case this game is for you. However, this game would only need one stage if that were the case. It wouldn't matter that there are so many stages in this game becuase you would be fixated on only one.""Do you want a game that have progression?"" As far as I know, falling means you only travel in one direction. I think there are many people who would love this game but for me, I'll wait for the movie instead. "

												Pretty fun game. It is a novel idea of base jumping, and the game is certainly not easy, but the levels are tough in a fun way. The developers released some new free levels, and the opening message about the developers changing every time was funny and original, plus you gotta love the owl for the symbol. There is a lot of fun to be had while flying down at amazing speeds narrowly missing things and fitting into tight holes (yes, that's what she said, I know you were thinking it). It has that exhilirating feeling when you go so fast you can barely keep up, you sometimes get the actual feeling with a little feeling in your stomach that sometimes goes into your♥♥♥♥♥♥balls (guys you know what I'm talking about). So why am I giving the game a down vote, for a few reasons. First off, although the idea is fun at first, it can be very repetitive because you literally just base jump for the entirety of the game, which isn't that short. It can start to become mundane because you're doing the same thing for the 100th time. Also, most levels are the exact same, with the same buildings and obstacles. More variety of where you are jumping would be nice. There are a few with rocks and a mountain, as well as a giant pipe, but for the most part the levels were interchangeable, which doesn't help with the repetition. More thought could have been put into level design. Also the few things that can add something to do (tagging buildings and giving thumb signals) stay the same throughout, so even after they are introduced in the first few levels, you never gain anything else to do, which once again adds to the monotony. Some other things to do would be nice.

												Hong Kong suicide simulator is one of the most thrilling games I've played, during my time as a 'GAMER', but I was quite confused at the strange game systems. Despite the fact that our character, Ju-long Liu, a depressed Chinese businessman from the Guangdong Province, who's fed up with life, is constantly making futile attempts to collide with buildings, and/or die, it is our decision, as the potentially cruel, morally gray observer to deploy his parachute, and make him merely 'hug' or 'kiss' the buildings as he plummets. We are also rewarded money for our actions, and again, Ju-long Liu makes more futile plummets off the side of buildings. Overall, it was enjoyable, but I'm incredibly confused, and I need time to think about what I've just played.			"

												A thoroughly unique and enjoyable game with so many levels that I'll probably never play them all. Hugs, kisses, breakthrough targets, birds, fans to greet, haters to flip off, and buildings to tag give players lots of ways to earn as many points as they can as they plummet toward the ground. One frustration I've experienced is that it's sometimes difficult to gauge your speed and desired direction as you approach the landing area which can make for a fantastic run that you lose because you missed the base by a tiny bit or break all the bones in your legs.Ultimately, though, I find this game enjoyable in short bursts, just a couple of levels and I'm back to work.

												I know some people are going to think I'm crazy, but this is a pretty good game. Normally, Dejobaan games aren't really all that good (to put it nicely), but AAAAA manages to not suck. Its gameplay is very simple; fall down a floating city, collecting points and buzzing towers for bonuses, and trying to land without breaking all your bones. More complexities are added, like bystanders and tagging certain buildings, but it never becomes too complicated to enjoy. It's dumb, it's simple, and it's good for just zoning out and playing something. I'd recommend getting this on sale, but you should definitely check it out.			"

												Aaaaaa.....AAA!!! for the Awesome is not quite as grand as the name implies.The premise of the game is base jumping and attempting to perform some flashy ""stunts"" in the process, mostly consisting of falling near the walls to earn ""kisses"" and ""hugs"", as well as to show off to the crowds with such crazy things as ""thumbs up"".  The game definitely does not take itself seriously, which is perhaps the best thing about it.  I would have disliked it much more if there was the sense of self-importance that many indie games are saddled with these days.That said, I still cannot recommend this, purely due to the repetitive nature.  Perform a jump, earn ""teeth"" or ""kneecaps"", unlock a new jump, repeat.  The levels are different, but they don't seem to be all that different.  They are mostly stylized falls around buildings that could not exist in the real world, and that leads to the levels all having a very ""been there, done that"" feel to them even early in the game.The controls aren't horrible but aren't great either.  There seems to be something about pulling the chute and landing that is very intuitive to some players, and horribly counter-intuitive to others.  I'm not sure why there is this disconnect, but I know that guiding myself after pulling the ripcord felt more frustrating than trying to carefully skim along the edge of buildings that are staggered back and forth at high speed, and I still don't think I really understand how landing was supposed to work.  It should not take more than a half hour of gameplay to have a feel for what is a vital part of the game- after all, an improper landing gets you no stars, and no teeth to unlock another level with.Now, if you happen to have an Occulus and can go full VR with it, I could see this game having much more appeal.  Maybe there is something missing playing on a regular monitor, when there is no real sense of falling (there is no ground that you can fall ""to"", and the field of view is pretty restricted with the random floating structures around you anyway). I assumed the game would be pretty fast paced, what with the idea of falling at terminal velocity and all, but it doesn't quite achieve that either.   "

												What's not to love about jumping off buildings?This game does risk/reward perfectly... you can retry a level at once with no penalty, but the crunch of slamming into the ground is so wrenching that you're sincerely desperate not to die.Scarier than most horror games, and much more fun!

												There is a quote (I believe by Sartre, though I won't swear to it) that goes something like this: We are afraid of heights not because we fear that we will fall, but because we fear we will throw ourselves over the edge.AaaaaAA etc. for the Awesome is the embodiment of that quote.The game is engaging, the physics fun, and surprisingly(frighteninglly?) engrossing. Though you will find yourself splattered across the pavement quite often, it's hard to feel like the game is punishing you for trying the tricky shots. Add to it the dark, quirky sense of humor (in-game text for hitting something at speed: ""Your femurs turned to femur paste!) and you get something fantastic.In short: Little is as liberating as throwing yourself off of a building and flipping off haters on the way down.

												If you have the original AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! and really want a few more difficult levels, stop reading and get this game. You can even transfer your old save so you won't lose any records. If you're new to AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, it's a game about skydiving off buildings, staying close to buildings as you're falling to collect points, but also trying not to die. You unlock a few neat items like spray cans (bonus points if you tag municipal buildings), coffee (temporary time slowdown), a glove (points if you thumbs-up fans and flip off protesters). It's a game that kills you for running into things but gives you points for style which requires you to get really close to running into things. The devs have an odd sense of humor (it seems like a few of the levels are based on in-jokes, one of which is actually explained in an unlockable bonus video). If you're familiar with other Dejobaan Games works, this has the same general tone.The level system is a bit annoying. Unlock new levels by spending in-game currency, and you only get in-game currency by matching or beating records on previous levels. If you buy levels in the wrong order, you'll find yourself unable to continue because you can't meet the score requirement on the levels you bought and the only 'adjacent' unbought levels are pricey. In theory you would continuously get better at the game to continue, but in practice it means you're farming easy to medium difficulty levels to squeeze out the last couple points you can. Also, the theme of levels is mostly totally unconnected which means that some levels require entirely different sets of skills (dodging a lot in tight corridors vs. wide open spaces with few point-scoring objects you have to fly to). However, the levels themselves are well-designed and unique enough to be entertaining, and the fast-paced arcade-style falling mechanic feels really fluid. One other thing the game has going for it is the art style. It's bright and colorful and in-your-face, which fits with the gameplay seamlessly (though some might find it a bit over-the-top). Ultimately, watch a video of the gameplay and imagine about 100 levels designed around the same central theme. If you can get it as part of a bundle or on sale, it's definitely worth it. If you like the fast-paced feeling of rhythm or racing games and enjoy arcade-style skill-based point collecting, this is definitely for you.			"

												This game about base jumping is very nice. It's a pretty simple concept, but works really well. You just have to jump off buildings and build up a score by doing tricks while you falls through the air.The graphics arent amazing, but they're good enough. Same for the sound design. There are a wide variety of levels, which you can unlock in whichever order you choose, and they all have their own challenges in getting high scores.Although it can begin to get repetitive if you're going to try to beat all of the levels.This improved version has all the levels from the original, plus some more.

												This game is good. Yes, not great but good. It's very hard to screw up a game where you just fall past things and then POW, end of stage. Is it any fun? Hell yeah. Falling and avoiding stuff is kinda fun. Is it repetitive? Hell yeah. Once you fall past the first building, you've basicaly seen everything. It all comes down to: ""are you a persone with OCD who wants to get the best possible highest score?"" If that's the case this game is for you. However, this game would only need one stage if that were the case. It wouldn't matter that there are so many stages in this game becuase you would be fixated on only one.""Do you want a game that have progression?"" As far as I know, falling means you only travel in one direction. I think there are many people who would love this game but for me, I'll wait for the movie instead. "

												Pretty fun game. It is a novel idea of base jumping, and the game is certainly not easy, but the levels are tough in a fun way. The developers released some new free levels, and the opening message about the developers changing every time was funny and original, plus you gotta love the owl for the symbol. There is a lot of fun to be had while flying down at amazing speeds narrowly missing things and fitting into tight holes (yes, that's what she said, I know you were thinking it). It has that exhilirating feeling when you go so fast you can barely keep up, you sometimes get the actual feeling with a little feeling in your stomach that sometimes goes into your♥♥♥♥♥♥balls (guys you know what I'm talking about). So why am I giving the game a down vote, for a few reasons. First off, although the idea is fun at first, it can be very repetitive because you literally just base jump for the entirety of the game, which isn't that short. It can start to become mundane because you're doing the same thing for the 100th time. Also, most levels are the exact same, with the same buildings and obstacles. More variety of where you are jumping would be nice. There are a few with rocks and a mountain, as well as a giant pipe, but for the most part the levels were interchangeable, which doesn't help with the repetition. More thought could have been put into level design. Also the few things that can add something to do (tagging buildings and giving thumb signals) stay the same throughout, so even after they are introduced in the first few levels, you never gain anything else to do, which once again adds to the monotony. Some other things to do would be nice. Also the tagging and thumb signals aren't very accurate and you can look at things and press the button and it won't count, and the game doesn't give you a good enough indication whether or not you actually got it. They are a little too finnicky sometimes, and could have been polished more. Now for the worst problem. Although I am fine with having high scores and points, it should be for people that want to get leaderboards and want to replay a game. In this game, your star rating gets you stuff you have to use to unlock levels. This is fine for a while but then newer levels cost more than if you get a 5 star on a single level, which makes no sense. I got mostly 4-5 stars on all the levels, with some 3s, and only a very few 1-2s, and I couldnt afford to play about 10 levels. It seems so stupid that a developer would make something and make it soo inaccessible. You should not be decided to play more of the game based on a random score or time the developer chooses for you. That is what the leaderboards and other things are for the idiots that wanna keep replaying a level to get as high of a score as possible. I don't want to have to keep repeating every level till I get 5 stars just to be able to play more, because if thats the case then why include 1-4 stars, it's just stupid. FORCED did it too with challenges and SMB did it with secret hidding bandages and level speed run times. It is such a dumb and lazy concept used to force replay value on those that don't want it. They fix it with the added hard levels (what does it say that hard levels it the value you get and cost of new levels is MORE fair and balanced than regular levels). There are a ton of levels though, so good for them. But since I cannot finish the game because of stupid game design I cannot fully endorse the game. 5.5/10.			"

												So this isn't really a huge leap from the previous one as far as I can tell. Take it with a grain of salt, I only played just a few minutes and didn't feel like I needed to delve too far into it. The biggest improvement I could see was the hit box was shrunk and VR support was added. How many of you actually have a VR device yet? Exactly, neither does anyone else. But the hitbox improvement means you can really thread the needle that much better.Much of the look is the same though: menus, geometry, effects, pretty much everything. The only difference here is what appears to be newer and more interesting shaders. All-in-all, it's the same as before, and that's a little disappointing. I still recommend it because at it's core, it's fun. However, if you already bought the first one, you might want to wait for this one on sale, or just skip it altogether (unless you really want that VR support). If you didn't get the first one, then this is an easy buy.			"

Though you will find yourself splattered across the pavement quite often, it's hard to feel like the game is punishing you for trying the tricky shots. Add to it the dark, quirky sense of humor (in-game text for hitting something at speed: ""Your femurs turned to femur paste!) and you get something fantastic.In short: Little is as liberating as throwing yourself off of a building and flipping off haters on the way down.

												Hmm hmm. What to say about this game. The negative is basically meaningless 'cause I'm just really ""meh"" on this one. I don't hate it and it can be entertaining but it's not that compelling or deep and rather reptetive after a while.The visuals are kind of bland, for one. Funny, right, unique, but still very bland. I liked Drunken Robot Pornography's aesthetic a lot, but this game is just not as interesting visually. Musically the songs are all okay I guess? I guess. There's basically no plot except for a radio announcer guy who I ignored after the fourth or so time he appeared because just kidding there's no plot. Yeah, ehh.The gameplay itself is a more arcade-y score-attack type of thing, which is fine, but not my kind of gameplay. I'd rather the game be about completing hard levels than completing a lot of easy-to-average levels really well. Progressing in the game isn't hard but I have no drive to sink in the time it would take to 5* everything, at all. The controls tend to be decent enough though a bit sluggish-feeling, and the parachute mechanic is kind of trash, but it's all fine on a basic level. There's just too much of it with too little variety. I didn't even finish the main game levels (all the added ones though, which at least were decently interesting and more varied).I mean yeah, if that kind if gameplay is your thing, go for it I'd say. It's not really my thing. So I can't review it positively. EHH.			"

												Bosses and employees alike often see performance reviews as a necessary evil. Workers fear hearing their performance is inadequate, while managers struggle to find the best way to balance praise and criticism. But regardless of how a boss feels about putting his or her staff under a microscope, regular performance reviews are an important and constructive way to evaluate the contributions an employee is making to the company.The goal of a performance evaluation is to give workers feedback on what they are doing right and what needs improvement. Frequent, informal conversations with employees help managers to ensure everyone is staying on task and to address quick, easy-to-solve issues. Formal reviews, on the other hand, can carry much more weight, and even determine an employee's future career path at the company, for better or for worse.Whether you need a template for your formal, written evaluations or just need help starting a dialogue about performance with your employees, here are a few tips for bosses to make the review process easier and less stressful.

												Old game with new levels, pretty much indie full priced DLC. (Sorta like MW3 except that was retail full priced DLC)			"

												Awesome arcade style game, That challenges you, and gets you rather pumped. Story is absolutely non-existent, but who cares. This game is about jumping off buldings, scoring mass points, and just being... well, awesome. Definately worth a look if youre looking for a fun game to pass a short time span. Loading times could be improved, but then again, I didnt install it onto my SSD.			"

												This is a fun time killing game. I don't play for very long at a time, but play in chunks and enjoy it very much.			"

												This game controls very strange.  Its an interesting concept, but gets dull rather quickly.			"

												This is an okay game. Definitely not for everyone. It's basically just a sky diving simulator. But I give props to the developers because diving through narrow openings between buildings delivers a nice adrenaline feel. The levels are super quick to play, so if you're just looking for a game to pass the time, this is a decent one.But get this one on sale if you want it. I got this one through humble bundle. 7/10			"

												I have played this on my brother's Oculus Rift. He says it is the only game he has tried so far that more less just works out of the box in VR. You can get it sometimes for nearly free. It is a fun little game too.Edit, that was back on the DK2 you should note, before the commercial launch.			"

												This expansion for ""A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"" (which is one of the best game names ever) adds graphical improvements, gets the game running better on modern systems and adds a bunch of new levels and gameplay improvements.  The point of the game is to fly in your futuristic wingsuit as close to the futuristic buildings as possible, while smashing through point-scoring panels, giving thumbs-ups to your fans and flinging middle fingers at protesters.  If you can do all that and then land without messily killing yourself, you'll earn ""teeth"" that you then use to unlock powerups and new levels.  That's all there is to it, pretty much...and it really doesn't need more than that.  I nominated this game for the ""Whoooaaaaaaa, Dude!"" awared because I guarantee you'll say that the first time you play it.			"
