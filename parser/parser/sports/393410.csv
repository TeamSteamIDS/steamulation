												Great game, horrible developer.  I was a long time paying customer (VIP)  in this game and the guy that runs it totally mismanaged its development,  refused to communicate with the customers and then shut the game down in its entiretly with nothing more than a 1 line text.  When I expressed dismay with the developer and stated that I should be refunded the money I gavee him (90 days VIP) ... he banned me from the WoS forums.    He is a world class punk.   I will never play a game that this guy develops again.			"

												NOTE: THIS GAME NO IS NO LONGER PLAYABLE, AS THE DEV HAS REMOVED ALL THE SERVERS.This is by no means the perfect game. There are flaws, there are bugs, I regularly get dropped by the server. There are trolls online, both intentionally trolling and unintentionally (if you don't know what offside is, read up on it before playing!) But what it does have going for it is sheer fun factor.If you remember Sensible Soccer, WoSO is in a similar vein, from the pixel graphics to sharing more than a little in common with Sensible World of Soccer's name. But as the telling difference in the name reveals, WoSO is an online game. You control just one player, with the other players on your team controlled by other humans (yay) or the AI (boo). And it's this multiplayer element that is at the heart of WoS's fun factor. As in real life football, playing as a team is essential; good positioning is worth a lot and a team playing as a unit can still beat a team full of better players who are all playing for themselves. It can be really satisfying when your team puts together a string of neat passes culminating in a goal, or when you've spent 90 minutes defending resolutely only to nick a 1-0 victory in the dying moments on the counter.Controls are relatively simple; movement is via mouse (run to the cursor a la diablo), gamepad or keyboard (not a good option IMO). I'm using a controller where you have 3 buttons that I'd call ""shoot"" ""lob"" and ""pass"". The controls are not well explained, although there is a tutorial that gives you the basics. Bascially ""lob"" is a high ball, ""pass"" is a low ball and ""shoot"" increases in height with power. Hold down the button to power up. You can also control the height of the ball by either moving the mouse cursor nearer or further from your player, or moving your joystick in a similar fashion. ""lob"" performs a slide tackle when defending. Headers are finicky at first, but basically involve either the ""pass"" or ""shoot"" buttons (""lob"" will make you slide instead).There are no fouls - strategically taking out opponents is part of the game and underlines the arcade feel of the game. Offsides are implemented, so no goal hanging allowed. Other than that there are 3 player models (small/normal/large) you can choose from if you pay for a VIP account. The small players are however vastly overpowered (they are quicker than everyone else) and I personally find it gets boring quickly if one team has several fast players and the other doesn't; you can essentially run the entire length of the pitch with the ball without being caught, which removes any element of tactics from the game. I think there needs to be a better model for financing the servers than one that makes the game less fun (IMO of course) for everyone.Other downsides include: No ability to kick players. AFK players can ruin matches by playing everyone onside and making teams unbalanced. The same player may be AFK for over half an hour and isn't kicked. As with any online game, there are trolls. But most players are very friendly. If you have the bad luck of joining a server full of 13 year olds, best to switch to another server. As per usual, things get better later at night when the kids are in bed. No real auto-balancing of training matches. While the game assigns new players who join the server to the team with less players, an auto-balancing feature would be nice - at the very least at the start of each match, if not each half. Unbalanced matches are no fun. A lot of players will however change teams to balance things out. A match-making mode is supposedly on the way, which should help in this regard. A few weird bugs/idiosyncracies lead to WTF moments every now and then. Nothing to ruin the game though. The league and team systems don't work. The leagues are full of dead teams and playing matches between teams is a pain, especially as it's uncommon for 6 players in the same team to be online at the same time. I much prefer 6v6 (the maximum), so I spend almost all my time playing training matches. I find 1v1 and 2v2 matches fun for a few minutes, but not for a whole match. There are a number of exploits in the game. Some are obvious exploits, some are at the very least gamey. You don't have to take advantage of them of course. The dev does respond to requests and suggestions, and there have been several changes made to the game since release - many good, some bad, and some neither here nor there. However, active development and a willingness to engage with players is always a good thing.Seeing as WoSO is free, there's no reason not to try it our if you like football games - especially if you were a Sensi fan back in the day. This isn't a game for the people who buy FIFA or PES for the skill moves and motion capture graphics. WoSO is much more tactical - yet also more arcadey- than those 2, by virtue of its simple nature. If you do try it out, definitely play the tutorial and practice knocking the ball about a bit. Play a couple of matches on an empty server both with and without bots to practice passing and shooting. It only takes a short while to master the basic controls. It'll take you a long time to master the game though.			"

												This game is fun. It looks basic, but all the tactics you would use in any of the major Football/Soccer games are there. Easy to learn, fun to master. A quick download. Full controller support and easy to navigate interface to get into games/matches. You control one footballer on the pitch and the other players are real people from around the world. 3 pressure sensitive buttons make up the game controls. If you've ever played this sport in real life, watched this sport, or played any of the other major soccer games...you will have an advantage over people who know nothing about this sport. That's a good thing, and it feels really rewarding when you play the game. It's a free game that isn't at all pay to win. You'll get into it fast. The only issue is that the game at times can lag if you select a match on a high pink server. I've found servers every time I go into the game as low as 24 ping, and been able to play on this without issue. The developer is working on this issue and working to add other features to the game. Give this game a try, and then talk your friends into it. Even the ones who are not fans of this sport.			"

												Very fun for groups of friends to play together even if they are miles away. Main issue is the client-server lag, which could just be fixed with more servers, idk. Another issue is the AI. They will pass to anyone even if they aren't open. They also are OP because they dont require any charge time on shots and passes, as in they can pass in the blink of an eye. ""They are spoons-for-trousers stupid but gifted as heck"" is what i find myself saying very often. Needless to say, it is very fun and should be polished up some more, most people who play it really enjoy it.			"

												Controls are a bit janky, and absolutely no instructions on how to play the game (keymapping etc), so need to look on their website to find anything (though they are pretty simple). Supposed to work with controller, but not sure that shooting works correctly while using it (no option to control elevation, where distance between cursor and player controls it with mouse controls). Lots of jittering, not sure if it's a game or a server issue (when ping is around 23, and connection at my end working perfectly). I like the idea of the game, and think with a bit of work it could be fun, but it doesn't quite bring back memories of the enjoyment of Sensible Soccer (the original) or Net Yaroze - Total Soccer (the two most fun top down 2d football games I've played on console).

												World of Soccer, the successor to Netsoccer and Netsoccer 2, brings you an unmatched experience in virtual football. It allows you to play the sport we all love in a way that most games do not let you. It removes the arcadey experience of ""Be a Pro"" modes in larger games and gives you full control over your player's actions. Like the best games, it's easy to learn and hard to master. It will take some time for you to learn the intricacies of the game, but when you do, and you actually find a team and ""click"" with them, it makes for one of the most satisfying gaming experiences you'll ever know. The controls might not be the most obvious for people who haven't played it before, but you can quickly learn what is possible and then, practice makes perfect.Having played its predecessor since 2006, and having spent an embarassing amount of hours on it, I can only recommend to you from experience that it's something you should try if you feel like playing football with your friends and make sick plays, but don't feel like getting kicked in the shins.The game itself does feel like it's not yet completely functional, some things aren't very intuitive (like chat) and it can definitely become a lot better, but I still recommend you try it.

												After reading some negative reviews, the first thing that comes to my mind is that the people who wrote those reviews can't play the game and obviously didn't bother to give it a chance.The gameplay is awesome for a 2D game, it's extremely addicting and fun, however, some things COULD be improved such as the controls and the UI. It didn't take me long to learn how to play the game (it was a question of minutes) so, the controls, in my opinion aren't a problem.The UI is a bit laggy and glitchy, the developers should work on it but I honestly don't think it's a hell of an issue for people to be giving this game a negative review.The community is really friendly, from what I've seen, which is not really common nowadays.

												This game is extremely simple, which is usually not a bad thing. Sadly, this game also feels very uninspired. From the art style to the sound design, it is quite clear that essentially every aspect of this game was simply not crafted with the love and care and attention that some of the great game developers such as Valve have. I feel like the dullness of the game cannot even be attributed to a potential budgetary issue the developers may have had. They could have certainly spiced this game up if they had tried or cared to try. Either way, it is a very simple game that virtually any PC could run, so it does have that going for it. There seemed to be a decent, albeit small, chunk of people playing. (I played for just over five minutes, so take what I say with a grain of salt, if you must.) If they added achievements or in-game voice chat, this game would have a better chance, but I fear it'll die off in no time. :/ I suppose it's worth playing if you're bored or feeling like trying something new. After all, it is free... It would be a crime to charge actual money for this game... Speaking of which, I did not notice any offers for micro-transactions, which is also a good thing for this particular game. Ah, I digress. Play it at your liesure, but don't expect too much.			"

												This game still needs a lot of improvements. First thing annoyed me was how buggy the gui and the menu screen was. When I typed it would go crazy and glitch letters accross my screen. I ignored that and tried out the gameplay to see if the gameplay would make up all of this but the game was very hard and pathetic. The teams were 4v1 with me the only person on the team. There should be a team balance or something of that sort. When I quit the game I tried to quit the game but I could not find any exit or quit button so I had to shut it down using the task manager. Overall this game is alright for a free game but still needs improvments.			"

												The concept is very good. Old style football game. I like it! :) Some changes you should make to make the game more exciting:*Make it faster(more real), the players are really slow, specially with ball.-Is really hard to dribble like this. -Isn't fluid.-When you shoot with LMB you should lose a bit of speed but not that much.-When you just do a single click with RMB you shouldn't lose speed(maybe a bit but not like it is atm). *Players shouldn't be like ghosts, would be better if we could block them.-Would be nice to avoid slides and to get position, etc. Like it happens in real life.*Asking the ball to the keeper. Avoiding random kicks to the mid all the time.Not so important but also something you should care about:*Design/Menu should be easier to understand, is very confusing. Explore others game, google about it, ask help to a designer. -Make it simple.-Make it more attractive. -Make it easy to understand. /For ex. I think that the design has no conection with the game it-self how it is. Those are small things that can make an huge difference. /-Chat is also confusing. Specially inside the game.The game has an huge potential, so don't stop and keep developing your game.It's nice to see so many people in the game.			"

												Alright i would like to say this is a wonderful game. first of all you install it. then you click play and you start on a fun journey on a screen it tells you World of Soccer Online at this point i am extremely excited and can not wait to see what other fun things i can do in this amazing game. in the middle of the screen it says Connecting to load balance server... as you can tell this was completly unexpected. i continued in my attempts to continue but to no avail it was after 10 minutes i realised that this must be the first boss. i attempted to defeat him but he was too hard his healthbar stayed on 3. i was a bit disappointed that the graphics werent that good as there were no pictures or anything just words but the very hard bosses was a real postive in this game. i think a lot more games should be like this. after 1 hour i couldnt beat the boss although Connecting to load balance server is a weird boss name and i would advise not using ... as a health bar as hearts would be a bit better and more obvious to less intelligent players. Overall incredible game and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hard game.			"

												Update: It's dead, main server not responding for a while, not a word from dev and they didn't even refund the VIP players. That's epic.Previous review:Addictive experience. Hard to get at first, with only 3 action butttons, but when you get it oh how fun it is. I strongly recommend a controller. Let's you control your speed and you'll have a better control over the ball (more specific directions for your passes or shots). Try it you won't regret it.CONS: THE LAG, but trust me, you can live with it.			"

												Playing this game is like playing an unfinished product. Mainly because it is one. With my experience, the gameplay is the same - either too balanced, or too unbalanced. What do I mean? Well, this game would have been tons more fun if you could upgrade your player to specific stats, so training rooms and teams could require a specific level cap (so it isn't too unbalanced).This would create strategy (that is missing from the game) and complexity, trying out new styles and possibly being a fun experience. However, we settle for this - a really basic unfinished product where every character plays the exact same. When in matches, unless you're teamed up with people who aren't selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you'll find that the only person defending is your keeper (who is CPU controlled), every teammate ever would just act like a hero and come up forth, ignoring basic offside rules, ultimately screwing up the team. This could be countered by adding a ratings system based on the player's performance in his positon, so these ratings stick to a player after each game so people could know how much of a ♥♥♥♥ he is. But I'm not here trying to convince the devs to put a little bit more balance (or fun complex unbalance) to the game even though it would be great. I'm here to advise you whether this game is worth it or not. In conclusion, this game is an unsuccessful attempt at a minimum viable product, every player plays the same, basic physics and rules aren't that well implemented, slide tackles are too op (since there isn't any fouls) so you find everybody just lunging at each other at the speed of light, and the whole experience is just the same every time. This game neither showcases the random exciting nature of the real sport, nor does it showcase the players' skills. And that would be a good thing, if the game was just a simple fun experience, but it definitely isn't one. I'd advise the devs to take what they've learned from this failed attempt and focus on improving on the core formula, since this could be a great title, until then - I wouldn't recommend this title.

I played this game since 2010, called before Netsoccer 2. This game is like Netsoccer 3 for me. And i must say... IT'S BETTER THAN FIFA AND PES!This game is really ADDICTIVE and CHALLENGING! It reminds me the times i played football with my friends on school. Here is the same. Each user controls ONLY one player and that fact turns this game REALLY ADDICTIVE.World of Soccer Online is a proof that a great football game doesn't need to be like FIFA or PES (having great graphics, etc). A great gameplay is enough.Yes, the game it's lagging due to the hundreds of players online at the same time, but THIS IS STILL IN ALPHA VERSION! The owner will improve a lot this game, fixing the bugs and problems. He just need some time to do everything that he needs to do.9/10 - It's one of the BESTEST FOOTBALL GAMES in the world, if not the BEST football game ever created!www.marcostrindade.com "

												This game seems to me like a project from a student who is learning programming, not a professional game.There is no in-game tutorial, 2D graphics make the game look outdated and the game has overall ""cheap"" feeling. Gameplay is pretty much boring, too.My rating: ★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ (1/10)			"

												This is the worst game i have ever seen. There's no keymap guide on the settings menu, it was all a good guess that on the general tab on the forums someone would post it and there's no stamina, so instead of playing positions everyone chases the ball and no offside also, you just wait for a cross to 1v1 the goalkeeper just to ultimately fail at scoring, because you can't shoot properly.You have to be vip to change your characters size that determines your speed, so by being slow you have to lightly tap the shoot button to kip the ball, but the f*ing lag, you tap the button and your character kick the ball away. Theres no other way, you either tap the ball or get tackled from behind, and when somene do that they can get a free kick, because the football rules in this game where created by some obese programmer that has never seen sunlight in his life, or played real ""soccer"", or maybe that happens because of the lag or the netcode is f*d up.Playing this game is like finding out you have cancer.

												Okay so to all the haters of this game complaining about unfinished game whatsoever:get some skill, join a ♥♥♥♥in team and play competitive matches if youre tired of selfish f.ucks who refuse to understand offside rules and basic defending.I mean i get you: the casual ""training"" mode is like playing a friendly match with random ppl on the server. Most of them suck so much balls that u wanna go cry and uninstall the game. But do not despair: Eventually you will find players who will notice your skills and invite you to their team unless youre a total ret.ard and cant play at all. In that case you end up playing training matches forever with lack of defensive players and terrible (if at all) passing playsLately i joined a rather decent team with more or less able players. Once you get used to the shooting and passing system you get to see the real potential of the game. The key is to anticipate the ball´s curvature when in air and try to load your shot as early as possible and release it on touch to get nice tiki taka style passing. Basic shooting on goal is rather easy. It takes more skill to score from a greater distance or at narrow angles. Download it, play it for a couple of days and unless you´re not the least skilled player of all times you should be able to get used to the controls (mouse only or gamepad) and be a valueable part of your team.

												Thumbing it up only because of the potential the game has.  Unfortunately it suffers badly with lag and the controls are naff.  Who's bright idea was it to use keyboard key ""A"" to perform a slide tackle.  Im constantly looking at my keyboard for ""A"".  Why not have left mouse button to pass and shoot and right mouse button to tackle???  Love the concept and I grew up with SWOS as a kid and have bee waiting for something like this for years.  Great that you can play online leagues and join different teams, great that you play just 1 position on the team.  It really makes you feel like you are playing as a team but please if any devs are reading change the slide tackle key and sort the servers outs			"

												I am a very fussy gamer. It had some lag issues when it launched which seem to have been fixed promptly.Gameplay wise it's the perfect successor to Netsoccer.It is a great, fun game to play with your friends, mind that lots of newbies run after the ball, don't pass etc... You will have more fun with good players.			"

												First time ever writing a review, and i felt i should do it for this game. It brings backs some really old and cool memories in playing Sensible World of Soccer, one of the simplest and best soccer games ever.This game really stands out by its simplicity, while not being a ""stupid"" or basic game - no! It's an intelligent soccer game, where while you learn it you begin understanding that teamwork is really important.8/10 for it! It needs some improvement on the Menus UI and interaction, and some basic understanding of teams and controls. I do believe it will be greatly improved.			"

												World of Soccer Online is a great top down view game of the game Soccer. Tons of fun with easy to learn, simplistic controls, but hard to master. Some good features are, you guessed it, Online. Up to 5+ players per team supported. Can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 5v5 or 6v6. Control just one player and team oriented. You can play with bots or other players. Fast paced arcade football that is only fustrating when you are playing with incompetent players. That said, best to join a team when you can or create a team. Compete in leagues and battle for the title of the best! Weather you are a fan of the sport or just want to virtually kick a ball around, this game is for you. Fun to play with friends and a great time if you love the sport.			"

												Overall Review: 7.5/10OverviewThis game is great. The servers have a bad history, but after a bit the creators got new servers up and running and logins are working flawlessly. The person making this game is a previous developer of Net Soccer, and it shows. The UI is the most painful thing in this game, expecially when it was back when the servers were trashy, but since the game just went up from greenlight it's okay to have some inconvience riddled inside.GameplayThe controls are, if not exactly a replica of, a close copy of Net Soccer, which controls very well. I like the ball lob mechanic the most, and the slide tackle works very well. I've never played Outdoor Soccer(Football), but these seem very nice for the game. The AI controlled players are very well created too, I'm honestly suprised at how well they preform. You can call to them to pass the ball to you, but I wish it made some notification so that you could notify other players as well.Community & Online PlayThe community isn't that great according to some people, but I haven't seen one person that is too rude or plain annoying yet. The team system is well made too, You can make your own custom jerseys, which look actually nice in game. The organised matches are the bread and butter of this game and I love to play in them. With good communication you can make great plays and tactics, and its overall very well done.ConclusionOverall I think this game could DEFINITELY use some changes over time, but for only 3 days on steam, it looks amazing and plays very well. The reason for my lower score is that the UI needs some serious reworking to be usable. He possibly needs to find some community members to help with that, most of them would know how it should be done to fit to the player, considering they are the community.			"

 Hours and hours of funI have 24hs on this game so i think that i've got a full view about it.The game is incredible fun, can be tedious sometimes because of new players that still don't get it but we were all new at first.  The controls are simple but kinda hard to master, a few days ago the developers added a Tutorial, so that will make it simpler to understand.  There are NO FOULS in the game so be ready to dodge A LOT of kicks.  There's ""offside"" so be ready also for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by those who don't understand the offside line and they run to the edge of the field and pretend a pass.  You can create your own team, edit the shirts and even have a logo and play against other teams and leagues.  Once you mastered how to shoot can be very easy, so if the rival isn't some kind of challenge, you can be easily bored from scoring too much goals.I play in South America servers (i'm from Argentina) and I play with 0 lag, the server has 40-50 ping, i've seen reviews saying that the servers are extremely laggy but that's not my case, anyway there's no way for me to play outside SA, because there i'll have an extreme lag, but just play on your country and problem solved.

												First time ever writing a review, and i felt i should do it for this game. It brings backs some really old and cool memories in playing Sensible World of Soccer, one of the simplest and best soccer games ever.This game really stands out by its simplicity, while not being a ""stupid"" or basic game - no! It's an intelligent soccer game, where while you learn it you begin understanding that teamwork is really important.8/10 for it! It needs some improvement on the Menus UI and interaction, and some basic understanding of teams and controls. I do believe it will be greatly improved.			"

												I am a very fussy gamer. It had some lag issues when it launched which seem to have been fixed promptly.Gameplay wise it's the perfect successor to Netsoccer.It is a great, fun game to play with your friends, mind that lots of newbies run after the ball, don't pass etc... You will have more fun with good players.			"

												Simple/basic football game! Pretty fun to kill 20 minutes with but not much more than a basic point and click game. Pretty much on the same level as a browser or java game. Controls and gameplay are simple just make sure you find a low ping server or lag kills the game play. Don't expect Fifa, PES or Football Superstars this is very simple and basic but if your a football and multiplayer game fan might kill some time when bored. Hopefully they'll add lots of features like customised characters and stats.			"

												Only played a couple of games but I feel I can recommend it already. Games haven't shown any lag yet and are very easy to join. Feels almost identical to Sensible Soccer but with analog movement and shooting (tested with 360 controller).The big difference however is that you only control one player, so chasing the ball around junior-school-style will only get your team ripped to shreds against any team with a bit of tactical nous. This opens up interesting decisions; should you play attack or defence, or adapt as the game flows?It'd be good if they added an offline mode with switchable players like the original ""Sensi"" just for fun and practice. It'd be even better if we could have local 2-4 player games in that mode as well.I've also seen a few complaints about the UI. I've seen better certainly, but it does what it needs to do and I didn't feel it detracted from the experience.Overall, it's a great free game that's fun and hardly takes up any space. What are you waiting for?			"

												World of Soccer Online is a great top down view game of the game Soccer. Tons of fun with easy to learn, simplistic controls, but hard to master. Some good features are, you guessed it, Online. Up to 5+ players per team supported. Can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 5v5 or 6v6. Control just one player and team oriented. You can play with bots or other players. Fast paced arcade football that is only fustrating when you are playing with incompetent players. That said, best to join a team when you can or create a team. Compete in leagues and battle for the title of the best! Weather you are a fan of the sport or just want to virtually kick a ball around, this game is for you. Fun to play with friends and a great time if you love the sport.			"

												Previously I had written that the lags made the game unplayable. Now the lag is gone and the game is going in the right direction and I'm loving it. It is neat little game at this point and it has a lot of great potential. It is a great ♥♥♥♥ing concept as well because I am in love with football games of any kind and often find myself wanting to play those oldschool birds-eye-view arcade football games on my PC and there aren't many like it anymore. The only thing that bugs me a lot at this point is the UI. If the UI changes it would look much more accessible I'm hoping. Also it would be amazing if there were more customizations and all to make the game more easily replayable.			"

												World of Soccer Online is a great top down view game of the game Soccer. Tons of fun with easy to learn, simplistic controls, but hard to master. Some good features are, you guessed it, Online. Up to 5+ players per team supported. Can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 5v5 or 6v6. Control just one player and team oriented. You can play with bots or other players. Fast paced arcade football that is only fustrating when you are playing with incompetent players. That said, best to join a team when you can or create a team. Compete in leagues and battle for the title of the best! Weather you are a fan of the sport or just want to virtually kick a ball around, this game is for you. Fun to play with friends and a great time if you love the sport.			"

												Well I was looking for a free game to pass time soo after 10 minutes of looking i found this.The servers wont good and have alot of potential HOWEVER gameplay is slow and lifeless and its just dreadfull to play with people you dont know because its rare they pass the ball and when they do its because they hit the wrong key.The game itself has a very SMALL window to improve and the devs have kinda stopped updating with anything we actaully want to so to sum up.Slow and lifelessDreadfull ControllsBad Co-op Devs are dead and have nothing more to contribute towards developement of the game.Shortly after it becomes a waste of time.

												Only played a couple of games but I feel I can recommend it already. Games haven't shown any lag yet and are very easy to join. Feels almost identical to Sensible Soccer but with analog movement and shooting (tested with 360 controller).The big difference however is that you only control one player, so chasing the ball around junior-school-style will only get your team ripped to shreds against any team with a bit of tactical nous. This opens up interesting decisions; should you play attack or defence, or adapt as the game flows?It'd be good if they added an offline mode with switchable players like the original ""Sensi"" just for fun and practice. It'd be even better if we could have local 2-4 player games in that mode as well.I've also seen a few complaints about the UI. I've seen better certainly, but it does what it needs to do and I didn't feel it detracted from the experience.Overall, it's a great free game that's fun and hardly takes up any space. What are you waiting for?			"

												They keep calling offsides. I do not think it means what they think it means. It really adds to the realism, though. Refs in this game are just as we Todd id in real life.10/10			"
