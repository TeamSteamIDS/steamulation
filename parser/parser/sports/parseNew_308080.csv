								If u liked  Sonic & all-stars racing or Skydrift ,Altitude0is a must-have arcade/racing game.No,it doesnt have guns like the titles above but it doesnt lack in anything. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Traps in the flags and aero tricks give a nice playthrough. The game modes are: solo license,championship mode and users tracks.Variety in the difficulty of maps,though a new content / update is always welcomed.+ Able to choose control modes (arcade and advancedmode for more simulated flying)+ The  menu interface seems polished + Steam inventory drops,not necessary feature but its still nice to see+ Superb soundtrack+ Track editor is available,a good way for new content~ Online features exist but not many players out there yet (AI exist though,with rankings from ghost players/other users scores)---------------------------------------------------------------------Overall,i would recommend this game,it gets oftenupdated so far,hope to see new content/updates in future (for planes,enviroment-maps,plane parts etc)			"

								Trackmania with planes! In Altitude0 you race against the ghosts of other players on many different, and some whacky, tracks. At the current version there are three planes to choose from, all with slightly variying characteristics.Having spent more time with the game now, seeing the development pace, a small review correction was in line - the pilot wings experience i was talking about could still be achieved, but i don´t think it is going to happen soon´ish =)[old review]My short ""early access"" summary so far, even with some vital features still missing:If you always wanted ""Pilot Wings"" on PC (for the last 20 fricking years), this finally could be it - if (!) some vital  features like steam workshop support, an in-depth license system, stronger single player, and live multiplayer against friends made it into the game quickly.[/old review]			"

								I don't remember when was last time when I truly enjoyed racing game with planes. Even tho it's more of arcade game than simulator, it's really great. It's fun to complete training and gaining title of A0 Master, it's fun to beat weekly/overall records of certain maps and compete with others, it's fun to play on multiplayer and singleplayer. Sadly, there aren't many players and mostly you will play alone (you can do that on both single and multi option) but I hope it will change after game will leave early access. You can also customize your plane with special skins and stickers, which drops weekly like in CS:GO. With team of 2 people updates are going rather slowly but there is tracks editor, so if you think there aren't enough maps you can try yourself at making one. Even if this game is still in early access, it's at playable stage. I think Altitude0: Lower & Faster as final product will be something great.			"

								This is a fun and fast paced flying game with a focus on speed and altitude. It drops items that can be sold on the Steam market. This game has very nice graphics as well as Devs that are present and allowing the community to help shape the game. Support this game!			"

								Hi! Please read the previous helpful customer reviews, because I couldn't agree more with their recommendations. Stick with Advanced plane control mode (though) and you will soon become one of best pilots around. We are trying to build strong community, with weekly multiplayer events, building user tracks... I'm sure broadcasting the MP events will bring some more pilots. Small dev team has definately developed a big game with an altitude :-)			"

								Altitude0 is one of those games that you just keep on coming back to over and over again. Thing is, everytime I do strap back in - the game's developers keep packing on the content and refinements to an already great game. Jump in Early Access - you'll be glad that you did!			"

								Quick review of the game:With the current ammount of content I find the game really fun and challenging.It is still on Early Access but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a shell of a game..There is plenty of action into it with alot more coming!I own Sky Drift too (A similiar game in a way) but I always come back to Altitude0! I am hoping for some more mainstreaming the UI and the fix for the lighting in the night because it's currently blinding to fly at night As as mechanics the game is really polished (Need more realistic flying model? Just go to options and select the difficulty setting) + the soundtrack is good too (Some more songs will be great too)The online aspect is really cool too.Personally I am quite high in the ranks!About the items and P2W: There is no P2W here its all cosmetics that you can buy (Skins for your planes+stickers) You unlock parts in the single player challenges!I think this game is worthy of your time if you love flying planes!As of 12/20/2014 I rate the game a solid 8.5/10 Cheers to developer!

								If you are into speed, crazy maps and  you dont get frustrated too fast, i definetely recommend this game! This isnt about skilltrees, leveling and stuff, this is about oldschool fingerskills and beating records, flying as low as you can, since this makes you faster. I play altitude0 since almost two years now and it is still one of my all time favourites.10 / 10 would buy it again "

								__________Things that weren't fixed, though developer promised that.---------------1. Midair collisions. Bots often try to ram you. In 90% of cases it would be vertical collssion there someone hit you from above or below. You can't control your plane anymore and it flyes in unpredictable directions, but other person (who rammed you) won't be affected in any way - nor by physics or race/health-points  penalty.2. Respawn. It sometimes psition you in bad spots. I hate it the most when it respawn me right in front of mountain pass with no way to evade collision into it and then again respawn at the same spot.3. Controls. It might be subject to some desync, but I had issues with controls become barely respondable. It could drive me mad how sometimes palne won't follow my commands and just fly on its own will/Joystick sensitivity was even worse for me - I had to move stick all the way to a side so game recognized what I want to start turn. It might be lack of expierence in adjusting joystics on my side.4. HUD. It's positioned somethere in the bottom of the screen and has Throttle, Speed indicators and Radar of tiny size. Problem is you I rarely look in there and I completely miss the speedometer in my expierence.5. Matchmaking. Sometimes it puts low tier planes and high tier ones (with top modifications on them) in one race. Also, there's voting system to chose the next race, but it often offers bad choise - between 2 hard/unwanted tracks.6. Night mode. In particalr flight lights. These now made to work as floodlights pointed backwards - stay behind few planes and vast bright spots of all colours all over your screen would blind you, so you have to rely on your luck not to hit anything in your way.7. Tasks. Some have confusing descriptions._________Advantages--------------1. Ingame purchases. Maybe the 1st reason you was thinking of buying this game is to farm and sell items on Steam market.Well, there is a 2-4 items drop per week for completing races (in multyplayer and seldom - in solo). Developers have brought a cosmetics system which really fit into gameplay (unlike in many other games with skins). Here you have full body paintworks and artistic stickers as items. You could place up to 12 (I think) stickers depending on plane model you have.Both of really good quality and variety. It is delightful to see (and show to others) your plane in slow motion before every round starts. At some point you might even rethink your initial plan and keep stickers on your plane instead of having these on Steam market.2. Performance. Interfaces are nice and intuitive. Graphics are lightweight, so system requrements are acceptable even for 5-6 years old PCs.3. Simple to learn. It isn't hardcore flight simulation. Here they have pickable buffs, instant respawning and some healthpoints system. You loose durability of your plane with each respawn or collision. Really hard to master. You have to be ready to improve your skills and re-do same tracks numerous times. It actually could become disadvantage at some point.4. Progression system. It encourage you to accomplish tasks to gain access to faster planes and improved additional units. Tasks are vary from finish race in top-3 to hold below some average altitude throughout race or finish with damage taken below some % (percent).Though second tier plane is heavier, slower and controls worse than 1st tier and 3rd tier is way faster and more controlable than previous two, developers promised to balance these tiers later.You could actually improve your skill by following progression curve.5. Closed lobbies. In theory there's Events feature taht allows to create a lobby for only invited people to join it. Haven't test that yet.Variety. Weather conditions changing with every round. Vast range of races being rotated in multyplayer and available to be chosen on your liking in solo mode.6. Player created tracks. There's ingame editor ther you could build, test and publish tracks. Many of player created tracks were approved and are ingame now.Game replays. You could capture nice video from it or practice with ghost model of 'old' self.7. Nice additional features. Ingame videorecorder and editor to create animated GIFs of your gameplay with some options like text over the video and photofilters. Global leader boards and leaderboards for every given race.			"

								Very challenging skill based game. Would suggest to use advanced user settings and practice tail rudders first and then wing rudders on tutorials to attain mastery over plane movement control and then attempt to sync for a new comer.Takes a while to get used to the controls but once you get a hang of it you cant stop making podium finishes in races which is when the fun really starts.Has lot of customizations,tracks,leader boards,skins,custom races,replays and multiplayer.Ideal game to bring friends over at home and play against one another. Nice music,scenery and plane animations.Also lots of new developments still rolling out.			"

								Game looks and feels like alot of fun, BUT.... The controls need much work. Ex: I should be able to map Pitch ( Up/Down ), and Roll ( Roll Left/Roll Right ) to the mouse, then all I need is to have Yaw ( Turn Left/Right ) to the keyboard along with Accelerate and Decelerate. And YES, I know its an arcade port to PC, But since you are going to port it to PC why not give us all the options for PC Games?			"

If you're dobby, you can do horrorshow. If you osoosh then it smokes you. I smechd for hours the first raz I flew it, although I was spoogy! I had to do my cheest when I was finished. My baboochka hates it, because I ookadeet her oddy-knocky too much when I'm flying it. If you have nerves of steel, and ice water flows through your circulatory system, you'll do choodessny.
