												This game is fun and has nice mechanics, switching between snowball throwing and more standard gun mechanics. The setting is great, with really nice graphics and style.There are definitely more than 7 levels to the game (as some reviews have stated that's it and it's over) as I reached level 11 or 12 on my second try. You just have to keep an eye on your lives as they will run out quickly when getting pummeled with snowballs from all sides. It can be hard to see how many lives you have though in the middle of the action and it gets progressively harder. You also tend to not read the texts on the van that comes in that actually gives you some information that can be helpful.All in all, a fun little game which makes you break quite a sweat!			"

												EDIT: Since the devs have listened to the feedback and updated the price to a more reasonable ammount, it's not more than right that I update my review as well. :-)For 6€ you get your money's worth and I will definitely re-buy this game (might have to wait for the refund to get through first).The atmosphere is really nice and gets you in the mode for christmas and the gameplay is pretty good. On the down side, which caused my initial negative review is that the game essentially is just like a tutorial that you play over and over. I would like to see some sort of free-play mode where you play until you lose with a slowly increasing difficulty.Still, for the new price I think it's definitely worth buying.-------------------------------------------------------------------First game I ever refunded! :-(It's not that it's a bad game, but for 15€ all you really get is a tutorial to run over and over and I'm afraid it gets old quite fast. I woulnd't have thought twice about buying and keeping it if they sold it for 5€.On the positive side, the atmosphere and graphics are really nice and the gameplay is decent.			"

												High production values & fun for a bargain price.I hesitated buying this after a few negative reviews, but it seemed it was mostly due to the price (/amt content for price).It seems the price was cut in 1/2 or 1/3, as I only paid $6.49 CAD ( think it's $5.99 USD? ).Honestly for the cost of a cup of coffee I was truly surprised by the graphics/polish of this little title.Easy to hop in & start playing - throwing snowballs, defending, using the power-ups( shield & cannon ).I can see why someone might've griped about paying over $10 for this with the limited amount of content...but for the price it's at now I think it's a bargain for the quality.I'd honestly rather see more polished/finished games like this, with a suitable price point for the amt of content, than the countless $15-20+ EA titles I've purchased which were either abandoned or never reached a semi finished/polished state.Will be returning for snowball fights & using this to demo for friends & family through the holidays & for VR demos ""in general"" going forward.Kudos to dev for paying attention to the price. Know it's a fairly small market out there for VR games & must be difficult to determine price based upon level of effort & ROI.Looking forward to seeing what they come up with next.			"

												This is a beautiful game with funny (and annoying) characters. It's great to jump in every now and then to try to beat my score. If you want to get into the Christmas spirit, I'd recommend it :)			"

												Merry snowballs is absolutely great, it's fantastic, it's true! It has a snow gun, it's the best snow gun in the world, it is unbelievable. And it has snow, lots of snow, it is not real snow it is fake, it is fake snow. But you can grab it by the snowballs and throw it at the snow Mexicans. It has lots of snow Mexicans coming for you, they are total losers. You can make them fall from roofs, it is absolutely fantastic. It has a shield, it's huge, it is like a wall between you and the snow Mexicans, it is great. Don't buy this game, make your friends pay for it.			"

			Merry Snowballs is a Christmas theme single player snowball game recently released on Steam just in time for the holday! Test your skills at chucking snowballs at little kids in VR!		

I also review other VR games on my channel:www.youtube.com/c/thefishstickThis is a great little game for the holidays. I had a difficult time with the Oculus Touch throwing the snowballs though, sometimes it would work perfect but others not so much. I think it's because the game made me face to the left when my sensors were in front of my. I'm only using two sensors though so I'm sure it would have less issues when I get my third. Not sure how it runs on the Vive though as mine is waiting on a new 3in1 cable =(			"

												A really lovely game that can be lots of fun. The throwing feels a bit off but is still enjoyable.			"

												The game has a lot of potential. The graphics are really nice, and the general atmosphere is great. The game mechanics are pretty solid. However, it is short, with limited game play for the money. Also, unfortunately, it is still buggy. I bought this for a early christmas party, and in the beginning it was pretty stable, but an issue developed where the display got super pixelated and the only way to fix it was to restart the game. The only other game that I have a similar issue with is Zen Blade. Maybe they use the same engine or something, but it is not cool. We also noticed on a couple of occasions that the controls got confused and snowballs would go sideways rather than how they should. When it works, it works great though. Please fix the bugs and increase the play options and time, and I will be happy to revisit this review.			"

												This is an interesting concept.  I liked the scenery but it's not a full game.  It literally is over in almost 5 minutes.  There are about 7 levels and each one lasts about 30 seconds or less.  Then you are done.  Veryyyy pricey for a demo.			"

												Solid gameplay mechanics and physics, simple and very fun.  Not something I play for hours on end, but a game I return to in short bursts again and again.  No glitches, crashes or stutters.  Great atmosphere and nice christmas-ey music.  You essentially stand in your yard and throw snowballs at kids across the street and around you.  Eventually you get snowball guns, trash-can lid shields, etc. to work with.   Excellent value for it's play-ability.			"

												 I love the artwork in this little game, it really does a great job of setting the mood.  Gameplay is fun for a bit, but I wish I could walk down the street and just look around because the scenery is so great.  Hoping for more from this developer.			"
