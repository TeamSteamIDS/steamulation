												Another year another cricket captain. While it might look like not much has changed since last year under the surface the new camera and improved odi games make it much more enjoyable. The first class games also seem improved and it is the most addictive cricket captain in recent times.At a resonable price this game goes down as a Chads Choice.			"

												as always another year and another title i always purchase straight away. although not too many new features, this years version is already my favourite. the one days and 20/20 are much more realistic and far more enjoyable than previous versions (i often let the AI control my team in 20/20). if your new to cricket captain - this is a great title which you wont be disappointed with. if your annual purchaser - this is an expensive update - but the best one to date.

												I really love the latest version of the Cricket Captain series.  I have played every edition since the first (in 1998?!), and I feel that this particular version has made the most impressive strides.There are some fantastic new features including new stadium camera angles and graphics, the NZ & SA Domestic competitions, the ability to play tournaments as minnow nations, as well as a whole host of other smaller changes and improvements.  The gameplay has been tweaked and feels more real than ever.  I notice from the Childishthings forum that there were requests last year to add new camera angles - it is great to see that the developers engage with supporters of the series.I played the last two versions of the game mostly on a tablet, but with the attractive new visuals, I tihnk I will probably want to play with a large laptop screen as much as possible!  This game is already proving to be incredibly addictive - I have started a save with each of the five domestic leagues!  Whether you are an ardent cricket fan or whether you just want a ""pick up and play"", I think you will enjoy this game.  Please drop me a line if you have any questions.  I know that if you are in two minds about buying the game, you might want to explore aspects of the gameplay - I will do my best to answer any questions you have!!			"

												My relationship with the Cricket Captain series over the last 15 years has been love and hate but this year the ""developers"" have excelled themselves, apparently adding nothing new to the series, living up to their growing reputation as pushers of old hack for our hard earned cash.Remember the good old days of International Cricket Captain? The series used to offer a wealth of management stats and gameplay longevity. The latest edition of Cricket Captain offers none of this.I was a sucker and paid Â£19.99 for what appears to be a 'tweaked' edition of Cricket Captain 2013. My advice is stay well clear of this game and not become Childish Thing's next sucker.			"

												This is a terrific game and great value for money on Steam. The essence of the game is its exceptional match engine which is sophisitcated enough to create a huge variety of results and outcomes. It is especially good at replicating the real life twists and turns of test match or 4 day cricket. If you are a cricket fan there is a huge amount of gameplay on offer here. The non-match management is not quite so good - aspects like training and player regeneration, for example, are a little limiting. But its clear that small improvements are being made with each edition of the game and the maintenance of the player database is very good with regular updates to reflect real-life changes or community input.  The game doesn't have the range of features or aesthetics of well-resourced series like Football Manager but in terms of realistic simulation of the actual sport it does very well for itself.			"

												International Cricket Captian has always been a franchise that people quick to criticise for not adding in new features in their new editions. This game has numerous improvements and new features to keep cricket lovers pleased for hours on end. If you have ever thought about getting it but put off by people saying it's not good enough, I tell you that if you truly want to manage a cricket team, this is the right game for you.			"

If you are a cricket fan and love sports management sims then this game is for you.  Game is constantly updated by the developers to ensure any issues are addressed and if you have a suggestions then the developers will always listen.  If in doubt, take the plunge and purchase the game.			"

												In a world where games are evolving in months rather than years it can sometimes be refreshing for game devs to stay true to a tried and tested formula.  In this case it isn't.  Maybe I'm a sucker for punishment, but I've owned 5 versions of this game since my original purchase of International Cricket Captain 2 and of all, the original was the best.  Over the years the 3d animations have slighly improved and there has been the introduction of things like Hawkeye.  But when year after year there is no improvement in the stroke animations making sense in terms of the line or length of the delivery, catches literally impossible for a human are regularaly taken, Hawkeye animations regularly don't match the delivery animation, and the aggression of the batting bears no resemblance to that chosen, eventually the charm wears away.  If you're after a cricket sim, this is your only option.If you're after a cricket sim that evolves and improves between years, maybe a 20 year gap between purchases of this game is the only option.

												2015 was a solid iteration of this series, and one I enjoyed immensely. CC 2016 does go a significant way to replacing that one though. Naturally, there is the update to the database, but now with two more domestic systems to explore, and associate teams for specific modes, it needed to be as solid as ever - a feat which has been accomplished. On a seperate note, the new camera system is also superb, and gives you the chance to sample the stadiums that have been painstakingly created. The arenas are top notch, and with some stunning skylines, the highlights are well worth watching.As a long term player of the series, I'm always keen to see how the game continues to improve. Yet again for me, it doesn't disappoint.			"

												Terrible game. Shots that go to random places on the pitch that bear no relation to the shot played (cutting full length balls from spinners for 6 for example). Outfielders that don't move thus rendering sweepers pointless. When batting your batsmen will do anything but the task you ask of them....and finally beyond the naked stats, badly researched (at least speaking as a Glamorgan fan). Seemingly batting styles have just been allocated at random.			"

												My first fiore into any 'manager' game, and I must say that it's incredibly in-depth and feature packed.  It really kicks you in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you don't take the time to play-through over by over yourself.   My only gripe thus far is that the commentary beats the umpire to the raise of the finger, which really ruins the anticipation. Certainly reccommended though.  For the 30 bucks, it's sure going to earn its keep for hours of play.			"

												I will say this upfront: if you are a hardcore Cricket fan, and if you enjoy the statistical side to the game, then you may end up liking this game. There are two core aspects to the game: selection of your team, and then setting fields and managing how aggressive your bowlers and batsmen are during the games themselves. You donât have any direct control over the players, so in many ways itâs sort of a cricket match simulator. The amount of input you put into the game is quite minimal, so it feels like a casual game with a strong statistical emphasis. The main difficulty with the game is the selection process, as you donât have access to any attributes, aside from their statistical records in previous matches, which like a real cricket selector means you either have to choose based on gut instinct, or record over a period of time.Whilst this simplistic style of game can be endearing, ultimately itâs hard to recommend at this price, as the game has not fundamentally changed in over 15 years, and the incremental changes are hardly revolutionary. The graphics and UI are awful. The lack of a player editor to fix basic errors in details and ability means that to seasoned cricket fans the database will frustrate, as the game outside of England is not well scouted or balanced and donât often reflect real world abilities. I understand the decision not to include editor is because the game is so similar to previous editions; fans would be able to update them themselves and wouldnât spend the money. However, when the database is so fundamentally flawed, I cannot let it slide.If you havenât played this series before, itâs well worth a look. If you have a recent edition, thereâs not enough new content to warrant the asking price. "

												Cricket Captain 2016 is certainly batting towards a nichÃ© market, but it hits the leather for six for its target market. As a self-professed lover of statistics and cricket tragic, firing up this game has done terrible things for my relationship because I'm now glued to the screen. It might not have the budget of the bigger sports titles in the industry, but its flow and attention to detail make sure it'll hook you in. It's got everything a sports simulator needs, depth, customisability, and a decent difficulty curve that allows both new and experienced played to enjoy the game.READ MORE - http://www.blotgaming.com/game-reviews/cricket-captain-2016-review/ "

												What utter tosh. Where to start?Firstly, the game is pretty basic and there isn't a lot to get involved in. It feels like a game where 90% of the content is purely for show and doesn't actually affect anything that goes on. Think of a slot machine with all the fancy lights, yet we all know the result is randomly generated. I don't thtink the coding on this game is realistic or extensive in the slightest.Talking of randomly generated results- several times during first class games I have been bowled out for less than 50 despite needing less than 100 to win. It even happens if I set my players to ultra-defensive and have 2 days in which to get the runs. There is no mid game save feature either, and you cannot exit the game without saving it. So when the game genarates these ridiculous collapses every game you can't even try again.My biggest disappointment is the West Indies. Don't pick them if you want to win a T20 game. The two time T20 world champions are given the batting abilities of a primary school kid facing the onslaught on an ashes bowler. The batting collapses in first class cricket, combined with the impossibility of getting a test nation above 110 runs in T20 all made the game a pile of excrement.Overall I would say this game was a complete waste of money and is so bad it gets boring.

												After putting over twenty hours in this game trying to understand WTH is going on, I'm left with the conclusion that there's very little going on and this game is rubbish.Invest 10k in physio and have zero physiotherapy available.Play as Australian, New South Wales team and see your team rating drop from 4.5 stars to 1 star, because ALL of your talented players go off to play in national team FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON; meanwhile the  state league opposition teams remain 4 and 5 stars.No editor, so you can't fix what's broken in the player data.Also, no indicating of potential for many players in pre-season draft. The coaching seems completely broken; I've yet to see any indication it works AT ALL.Your team will regularly undergo injuries and loss of form to the more talented players; rarely ever seeming to gain form.Complete batting collapses, along with your top bowlers getting zero wickets in hundreds of overs is very common.Stay away from this game; the developer appears to be milking every cent out of a very old title by reskinning a few features and foisting the same dreck on an unsuspecting cricket public.Quite a racket they have going on.Perhaps a developer going by the name of ""Childish Things"" should stay away from making sport simulations and start making games more suitable to four-year-olds.
