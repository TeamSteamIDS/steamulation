												Got a key a little while ago from a bundle i bought over a year ago. I thought i would give it a go as i used to quite like snooker. Glad i did as it's a very fun and polished little game. It is very easy to pick up and play for someone like me that knows the rules of snooker and have played it a bit but am also a pretty rubbish player:) There are lots of tournaments to enter and credits to be won. You can then spend them on upgrades, different cues, auto-chalk and the like. The AI is pretty good, doesn't cheat and does make mistakes. Obviously it gets better the further you get in a tourny but the difficutly is nicely curved. The graphics are good as are the sound effects. A special mention goes to the crowd. They ohh and ahhh when you miss and pot a difficult shot you'll be met with a cheer. You'll even hear them cry 'go on my son' and cough. And too much noise will be met with a shhh from the ref. If you like snooker even a bit you will enjoy this game. It's addictive and fun. I recommend picking it up on sale at least. Oh and it has pool too.			"

												As a huge fan of regular snooker, both playing at amateur level in my local club or pub and watching and enjoying top flight competition – I am disappointed with this dreadful attempt to bring snooker to Steam.Immediately this game is presented more like a final year project and the short-falls are painfully obvious from the get go.- Full of bugs- Balls appearing in pockets mysteriously- Child like understanding of the rules of the game- Zero ability to finesse shot choice- Ball physics give little to no satisfaction, with the side / swerve / spin apparently just included because it should be.I can’t recommend this even for the €2 in the sales – it is truly dreadful and frustrating.Playtime: 57 minutesRefund Requested			"

												for me having played the real game and having tried many other so called snooker/pool games have found this version simply brilliant. Yes there are the odd blip, like not being able to move around the table when white is in the 'D' following a foul. so here is my negative list;Multiplayer very difficult to find players - I would recommend setting up a dedicated data base that shows when people are active that way we could dip in and out. Develop an a web snooker league through steam. I have started a group so if you play snooker please join.The 3 miss rule, this seems wrong my understanding is player can hit an object ball but chooses not to then miss is called. not being able to travel around table to see all anglesa change of referree and maybe a comentary?so not a lot wrong really the points above are basic and could be rectified especially in any new upgrade. I hope that Bighead games do launch the new addition for PCSo for me i love it, great allround play, realistic so anyone not happy remember we are not the Rocket!!!! "

												This is not a game I can honestly recommend with a clear conscience, although people looking for a Snooker simulation on Steam are going to find their options sorely limited; this is in fact the only one, but there are so many things that don't feel right with this game.The AI difficulty can vary wildly within the same match, and even within the same frame, going from missing shots you'd think were unmissable to clearing the table unless you snooker your opponent on the break. The AI has no concept of shot selection either - in one example, the computer opponent had potted a red and ended up in the jaws of the middle pocket, completely unable to see pink and black. He them promptly nominated black (despite having an easy blue he could drop in to the opposite middle) and proceeded to play the cue ball directly into the jaw of the middle pocket, sending it careering around the table and missing everything. This happened 3 times in a row, at which point I was awarded the frame. Laughably bad.Michaela Tabb, bless her heart. She's a good referee and a likable character on the Snooker and Pool circuit, but there's no visual representation of her in-game at all; she's been reduced to a disembodied voice with about as much emotion in her tone as GLaDOS in Portal. In some instances, the game doesn't even get the scores right - on more than one occasion, I've potted a red, followed by a pink (for a break of 7), only for the game to proudly announce that I'm on a break of 6. The only thing stopping poor Michaela from turning in her grave is that she isn't actually dead.Sending the cue-ball in-off is a common occurrence, but one that seemingly happens at random, completely irrespective of how careful or otherwise you're playing. There is no consistency with shot power, with a 100% power shot sending the cue ball all the way around the table twice, but a 40% power shot is rarely enough to even pot the black off its spot.Animations of the crowd clapping are horribly and obviously looped, the player character is never seen and has no character model, so you can forget about character customisation aside from the name, and the opposing player is only ever seen sat down at the side of the table while you make your break. Obviously it was too much to ask to animate a model of someone walking around a snooker table and playing a shot.If you want a good snooker game on the PC, avoid this and buy Virtual Pool 4, which has a fantastic snooker game mode.

												I do enjoy a game of pixel based snooker and pool and have played many different games over the years, from classics such as Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker and Archer Maclean's Pool to World Championship Snooker and Virtual Pool 3. Over the past few years I've found my enjoyment from online game iSnooker, but the high price and lack of improvements in that game have meant I've given up on it forever. So, having given International Snooker a couple of long sessions, where does it stand on the scale? Unfortunately, a far, far way from the top. The interface for thisg ame is just poor beyond words. You can only cycle through frames, for example, by clicking on the field through all the options and if you go past the option yuo want, you have to click all the way through again to get to where you want. An option to just cycle up AND down would have been an obvious choice here. The menus are like this for everything and quickly become frustrating. Furthermore, most game modes are locked from the beginning and can only be unlocked by winning tournaments, so if you're keen to play pool more than snooker, you're going to have to play a lot of snooker for the privilege.The gameplay itself does not fare much better. The camera options are limited to overhead and table level, which is pretty standard, but during a shot you have no control and the AI picks the most awkward angles to show the shots from. Pots that would be impossible in real life - and would indeed not even be attempted by the top pros - can be pulled off with ease here whilst the AI play is erratic at best. Black off the spot? Not if a thin cut pink to the green pocket that offers worse position for the next red is there for the taking. Of course that doesn't matter, as an equally outrageous red will then be pulled off the AI, who will then miss a simple black off the spot in what is a real Jekyll and Hyde display. Perhaps the pink up to baulk was the right shot after all?The whole thing just feels like a huge step backwards from the games that have come before it. This is tedious, processional snooker at its most basic and uninspiring, and a game I simply can't find any reason to recommend to anyone.			"

												If you are a fan of Snooker, you will appreciate this title, as the physics are fairly true to form.  Since this is only a simulation, the game has to be a little forgiving in certain areas...namely that the rounded pockets seem to allow balls to ""bank in"" more than in real life.  It's great that you can unlock other forms of pool simply by completing in-game challenges, rather than having to pay for them.  There are no Steam achievements, but the in-game trophies are fun to earn.  The best part of this game is the online community; you can learn a lot from your multiplayer partners.Heroes of Gamers Haven:  Forum[www.gamers-haven.org] "

												If you are after a snooker sim, this is the game for you.. Smooth shots, smooth ball movement and very nice environment. Absolutely great in those respects.. However, lazy devs, have completely and utterly failed to produce a two player game that has any kind of reliable multi player. If you want to play vs AI then your laughing, if you want to play against another human? best of luck with that. I have played maybe 5 vs games online in the 30 plus hours of game play on steam and they mean nothing anyhow so people just concede on you mid break.. such a shame, lazy attitude towards multiplayer on a two player game by the dev team means that i cant recommend this title with a clear conscience.

												After reading some of the reviews for this title, some of them seem a little unfair.If you are after a nice little game of snooker and don't care if it has fancy graphics or well known players - its great. I agree it is a little easy, it's quite simple to make breaks that IRL would be almost impossible. But if you enjoy snooker as a spectator this is a great game.Although it lacks the humour and feel of old time (Archer Maclean) classics like Jimmy White and Pool, it's still a solid representation of the game of snooker.Personally, I don't feel that the physics are wrong, the cushions and pockets feel (to me) like they should and are a close approximation of a real ""fast"" table.I like that you can drop in and out of tournaments and that you can speed up the play of AI opponents.I'm not that fond of the woman they got to do the voice overs inbetween frames, but it serves a purpose I suppose.All in all it's an excellent and very playable snooker game and I'm glad I purchased it.

												""Quite possibly the most realistic Snooker game to come to any gaming platform ""- I strongly disagree with this statement, in fact it is most misleading and untrue statement you could possibly make about a snooker game. I have played many and this one is the worst of the lot. It is too easy, the pockets are too large, the cushions and bay are unrealistic, too fast, too bouncy...not to mention spin control is totally off and you dont even get a real player animation. In my opinion the trading standards people would rule this game ""not fit for purpose"" which i most definately would agree with. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME.			"

												I have been playing the game International Snooker 2012 for the past 3 months. This game is really so close to the real thing that is unbelievable. Unfortunately, a lot of flaws still exists in the game. I have found the AI players to lack vision in certain respects, some are programmed to be over 100% which makes them impossible to beat. They can also sometimes make the strangest shot selections and are very limited when snookered close behind another ball.My biggest criticism of this game lays in the multiplayer. It does not show all the names of players entering and also tend to lose connection at awkard times.What a pity that the developers do not have money to update the game properly  ( according to Big Head Games spokesman ) in an email to me recently.Maybe they should also be looking at a crowd funding solution so that we can all enjoy the game more.There are various other problems that can easily be rectified by a good programmer.I am therefore calling on Big Head Games to react to this review and tell us what you have in mind for this game.To make money, you must invest in this game and I am sure that the profits will exceed your wildest imagination.I am running a snooker league with this game, but in order to progress, the game MUST be updated.Sincerely yours.Christie Geldenhuys			"

												For a game that sells itself on ball dynamics the developers need to go and play a game of snooker in the real world.The ball dynamics are atrociously innacuate, and the opposition can hit balls that are not on the table to alter the trajectory of both the object and cue balls, using side to perform a masse or slow masse has absolutely no effect on the cue ball.If I want a game of snooker I'll be on a proper table down the club. This game is a total waste of £10. Learnt my lesson hope the people reading this heed my advice and avoid this game.			"

												If you are after a snooker game then this a good game with a fair price and great graphics. But there a few things to note. First off you are probably going to want to leave the aiming guides turned on. This isn't cheating, it just compensates for the lack of depth perception that is inherent in virtual pool games, at least until there is a version that uses the oculus. If you stick to playing in first person it gives a fairly realistic feel and balance to the game. If you turn them off then you end up playing nearly every shot from the overhead camera view which makes if feel like an 8-bit arcade game. Also lining up the shots in the overhead view without the guides is so frustrating that you'll find yourself moving your head to strange angles and spending a few minutes on every shot to try and find the right line, only to miss by an inch or two anyway. Changing to the overhead view at all could be considered cheating but it is the only way to get a overview of the layout since you can't walk around the table while playing, something that I found lacking. There are also shots where the pool cue completely obstructs the view while in first person, which is odd since a little tranparency would have been an easy fix here. Changing to the overhead view is a must in this case.To play you set the desired spin, cue angle and power level before clicking on a button to fire the shot. A mouse driven cue and power action is sorely missed here. Coupled with the guides it takes nearly all of the interactive feel of the game away. However, since spin, power and cue ball placement are so important in the game of snooker it still has its merits as a tactical game or training aid. As mentioned in other reviews, the AI is inconsitent because they will play poorly for half a game and then trot out a break of 50 or more at the end. I also feel guilty when snookering the opponent since in many cases they will miss, at least in the early stages of a tournament, and it is so easy to force them to replay the shot and win the frame by default after the third miss. They simply don't change the shot they attempted the first time.I'd recommend the game to anyone with a passion for snooker but I'd be raving about the game if these points were addressed. As it stands I'll just have to repeat that it is a good game with a fair price and great graphics.			"

												The score is 58-42, and Spyro Polymiadis is on a 15 score break. Three balls remain: The blue, the pink, and the devious black ball. As Spyro settles in to make the easiest pocket of his life, NickyJ utters the last rites over his own grave before Spyro buries him and all his dreams of a comeback.NickyJ: ""Just make this last blow a painless one.""*Spyro takes his shot and whiffs on it. The blue ball sails wide left of the middle pocket*Spyro: ""DAMNIT""*NickyJ proceeds to sink both the blue and pink balls, setting the score at 58-53. Only the black ball remains to finish this miracle, a simple knock in 5 inches from a corner pocket*NickyJ: ""Goodnight moon. Goodnight stars. Goodnight Spyro Polymiadis.""*Thud-Thud-Thud-Thud-Thud goes the black ball as it bounces off both edges of the corner pocket repeatedly while never entering the pocket*Spyro: ""Haha, tough break Nicky. Tough break. It's time for me to end this.""*THUNK - The black ball bounces off the corner of the rim AGAIN and rolls across the entire table to the opposite side* Somewhere in the chorus of laughs and cries that reverberate through the tournament center, Spyro and NickyJ both curse the name of that stupid Belgian who convinced them to play this irritating game that has ripped their hearts out and stomped on every single dream they ever contrived.-----------------For the $2 I spent on this game during a sale, I won't say it's bad. I certainly wouldn't pay its current full price of $13, though. Having only ever played pool before, snooker was an interesting change. After learning the basics of snooker quite easily from the game, I'll borrow the sage words from the cover of an Othello box to describe it: A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.Pros:+Easy to learn game with simple rules+Simple, easy to understand interface+Varying levels of opponent skill. Sometimes the round is really easy, sometimes really hard. A healthy dose of both throughout each tournament to keep it interesting.+Other billiards type games when snooker gets to be a bit boringCons:-Multiplayer is absolutely broken. Tried to connect 15 times, succeeded 3 times. If you want to buy this game for the multiplayer experience, don't. Period.-The graphics aren't the greatest. Which is fine, you shouldn't be buying a snooker game to look for high definition graphics. Even so, sometimes you just can't avoid noticing people like this: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/477768284585810206/64BB18D8ECA4F9FFDEDF99EB8BF042EBF90CF5DF/-When I mentioned a ""healthy dose"" of varying skill levels in tournaments, I half lied. Half the opponents are Jekyll Hyde behind a cue stick. Makes an awesome bounce off the wall that would make pros cry in one break; inexplicably sinks the wrong ball for absolutely NO REASON WHATSOEVER the next break.-Mind-numbing physics - I cannot count the number of times I've aimed for the corner pocket and had my ball repeatedly bounce off the corner, going neither into the pocket nor back out onto the table. Once is amusing. Thrice is bemusing. 13th time is agonizing.-Adding onto the above, the ball will never, EVER fly off the table from being hit too hard. If I could climb up onto the table and hit the ball with a golf club, it would never leave the surface of the table. Not really important, but just a petty annoyance of mine.Closing statement: It's not a bad game. If it's under $10, it's worth the money. It's not polished, it's not pretty, but it's still entertaining. Just don't buy it for multiplayer.			"

												It's not quite a simulation but it's lots of fun. Having said that I'm getting breaks just above the 50 mark which is exactly how I fare in the real game. I like the career mode with the easy early rounds and then tough opponents later on. The AI is OK. Let's face it the computer could play a perfect game every time so it has to be dumbed down, mostly you don't notice. Sometimes it reminds me of early games with my Dad, when he would throw a few shots so I could get some table time. Cue ball action is a little unpredictable but you can mostly get the position you were aiming for.There are significant problems with the Miss Rule (almost like real life). Your AI opponent will never put you back in, no matter how poor their position is. Also the AI will happily throw away a frame, or even a match, with three misses in a row.I like the crowd noises. The oohs and ahhs, the coughing and the occasional ""Go on my Son"" add to the atmosphere. It's a shame they didn't record more variations with Michaela Tabb, she has a gorgeous Scottish accent but sometimes sounds like a robot or answering machine because of overused words.I've had a great time with this game and it cost me less than a pound in a bundle.

												If you are a fan of snooker games then you will probably like this version. The interface is simple and easy to navigate. Controling the cue ball is very good with the various spin options ie top spin back spin and side spin all having a positive effect on positioning so you feel like you're playing snooker having to plan your next shot in advance. The AI can sometimes be inconsistant with your opponent missing easy shots one minuet then the next potting from one end of the table to the other. Their are various unlockables to be had by earning points for competing in tournaments ie different cue's, auto chalk, 8 ball and 9 ball pool. The graphics look decent and the sound effects feel authentic you can hear coughing sounds coming from the audience. Overall i would give this game 7.5 out of ten.			"

The AI is gonna make you frustrated it will pot balls from any position and i mean any if you have played real snooker and are decent enough player you will understand there are no players in game just a cue no ref just the voice wich sounds like a robot. That said there is still some fun to be had but i cant help feel even in 2014 we are still getting what looks like graphics from the middle of the 2000's			"

												M'kay, I totally and completely admit the reason why I bought this game is because I don't play Snooker and have always been curious. There is no tutorial to hold your hand here, much to my regret. That having been said, the 'difficulty' of this game is considerably higher than that of Pool Nation [edit: corrected by markie].I won't bother going over the rules for Snooker (if you're seeing this, you have internet) but will comment that the interface in International Snooker allows for a great deal of precision. You also get options for 9-ball and 8-Ball. The practice mode is helpful for getting the initial gameplay down as well. My only gripe here, which is NOT the game's fault, is Snooker's pace-- the game moves a lot slower than 9-Ball.All in all, this is a fair game... but if you aren't playing it Specifically For Snooker then Pool Nation is the better buy for a number of reasons. You have been warned.7/10			"

												""Quite possibly the most realistic Snooker game to come to any gaming platform""Well... if I were a betting man I'd wager against that. It most certainly isn't the most fun snooker/pool/billiards game I've ever played. Snooker games, by default, are always a little bit slow and can be a little boring at times but there are many ways to speed things up considerably and/or create a little more immersion than just looking at a cue and a bunch of balls for the entirety of the game.Some of those things could be (none of these are implemented in this game but have been in other, earlier games in the same genre):Immersion- Showing the players during, but at least before they start the match. They get introduced, wave at the crowd, receive a bit of applause and so forth.- Showing the players after winning a frame or match: are they affected by that respotted black game?- Getting a maximum break in a tournament. In real life, you'll see players crying, getting congratulations from everybody including the opponent, receiving paychecks and what not. In this game, you'll get a message once the frame finishes: ""You made a maximum break. Brag about it on Facebook"". That's it.- The thrill of winning a tournament. Surely, a bit more than looking at a rotating cup is not too much to ask?But, since most of its predecessors did not have any immersion like that either, maybe this game will make up for it in the fluid gameplay? Because with fluid, exiting gameplay you'd still have a solid billiards game. Unfortunately, no:- When playing against the AI, your opponent will have some sort of ""I'm going to make a 26 break now"" mindset. So what he'll do is make 7 shots in a row, some of them near impossible because his shot selection can be awful at times. Then he'll miss a really simple shot, probably because he reached the quota he was looking for. Not something you'd expect from ""the most realistic Snooker game"" if you ask me.- The game should find the ball I most likely will try to pot next. Instead, it will default to some awkwardly placed ball on the cushion, forcing you to do way too much manually.- Which brings me to the next point: it's too hard to aim. The mouse is too sensitive, and there's no ""fine tune aim"" button.- Instead, to fine tune you'll need to adjust the camera. And adjusting the camera will need a click on the camera icon. Why are no shortcut keys implemented? Why not make use of the middle of right mouse button? That is just plain lazy. It's like they never even played their own game.So because of various reasons, taking a shot will take way too long. Resulting in a very tedious exercise, a single frame will take you a long time. Then take into account that to win a single tournament, you'll need to win a best of 3 games, then two best of 5 games, then a best of 7 game, and last but not least a best of 9 game. Now, after several hours of tedious play you get to claim your reward: the visual of a spinning cup. Rock! Just 11 more tournaments of exactly the same to go! However, I am almost certain most people will not even reach the point of winning a single tournament.There are some good things about the game, like the stuff you can buy with upgrade points (different chalk to get more spin on the ball, different cues to be able to hit harder etc) but to get to these rewards you'll need to grind endlessly. Since this is the only Snooker game on Steam, I'll probably end up playing it some more but I cannot recommend it to anyone.Instead, look for Pool Nation. It's just pool but literally everything has been done better in that game. "

The two improvements I would like to see would be more items in the shop, and a more varied audience and opponent model. As it is now the audience is always the same people sitting in the same seats, and there appears to be only one sitting model of the players which is always the same.			"

												International Snooker is a game that fulfills an incredibly niche market, which is the simulation of Snooker, a billiard sport mostly played in the UK and other commonwealth countries. It involves colored balls of various points and the object is to have the most points at the end, not to sink the last ball. If you're used to International Pool, this game might be a bit of a rude awakening since mistakes are far more costly, but if you're a Snooker fan or willing to learn how to play this game can be an enjoyable experience. The presentation is very beautiful and the physics are realistic, all the way down to chalking cues.It should be noted that International Snooker has more than just Snooker. After completing your first tournament you can easily unlock 8-Ball, UK 8-Ball and 9-Ball modes to play with which gives you more modes and ways to play with than Pool Nation. Speaking of Pool Nation, a Snooker DLC is said to be in the works for that game, but if you can't wait for that, this game is most definitely worth picking up.			"

												Not bad but does feel like a direct port from a mobile / tablet game as the fine tuning can be very sensitive at times, no pad support (like pool nation for instants), huge mobile device like buttons and it doesn't even utilise the right mouse-click. I've also won too frames from the lower AI being incapable of getting out of the most simply of snookers that 'it' itself got itself into and won 2 frames as a result of the 3 miss rule.Aside from that for a fiver (or £2.50 as I paid) it's fine but certainly no more.

												 I purchased this for $1.39.  It's fun, but not without it's flaws.  I had to forfeit a match after scratching on a shot where the cue ball would not return to the table, so the game could proceed.   In this game if you have not played it, you earn credits to upgrade your cue, get different couloured chalk, etc.   I spent my credits on the auto-chalk feature, where the computer is supposed to chalk your cue before each shot.   I started failing on a lot of shots, and attributed the problem to not manually chalking my cue, even though | had this feature.The ability to fine tune your shot would be enhanced if you could use a key stroke to fine tune the angle, rather than just adjusting the mouse.   Sometimes it's two or three minutes to get where you want to position the cue.Lastly, this is an individual game, I am vain enough that | don't want anyone messing with my statistics.   It would have been nice if they could have added a feature where you could create other players, for friends to try the game.   You cannot lower the amount of frames played if you play 8 or 9 ball, every time you tap the button the frame count goes up.It's fun, but I am glad I only paid $1.39.  If they update to improve some of these features I would recommend the game, as it is, your statistics do not really reflect your statistics with these flaws.			"

Earn credits and use them to buy better cues and open up pool games etc. Venues change from tournament to tournament ,overall for the very reasonable price i love it , if you like snooker and want a chill out evening game this is well worth it			"

												Ah. no. By no means is this ""the most realistic Snooker Game to come to any platform"" - I have a Snooker game on my smart phone that's better than this, seriously. The main issue for me is that there are clearly control issues that mean that no matter how hard you try, you're not going to make those tricky shots and not even some of the easy ones. The AI on the other hand seems to have been provided with superior aiming ccntrols as it rarely makes an error once at the higher levels of tournaments.  Effectively you cannot consistently rely on the aiming paths shown and neither they - or the cue ball indicted paths -  are long enough to complete long shots and accuratley predict cue ball trajectory. Physics are not great either and forget trying to get back spin on the cue ball when you most need it. Just watch that cue ball fly into the pockets.Overall it's an OK attempt but sadly lacking in the areas that would make gameplay enjoyable rather than frustrating.- there are certainly better Sooker games out there, and just a pity that they're not on Steam.

												This game is clearly a phone game that's been ported to great mediocrity. The menus are a mess, and the tables lack any sort of subtle control. I should not have to dig super deep into my cueball and slam into it just to get draw, but according to this game there is no such animal as a two-inch screwback at low pace. The nine-ball and eight-ball are terrible, the tables feel so bizarre and floaty that they cease to be any fun. I'm not particularly opposed to the AI pulling off ridiculous shots constantly, because with the medium it is equally as easy to pull off superhero shots yourself, but there is no real interesting game here - especially when compared to its off-Steam contemporaries like Virtual Pool 4 or the WSC Real series. This isn't an awful game, and it is miles better than the dreadful Total Pool on Steam, but it's also not really great and if you're looking for a good pool game, there are better options.			"

												The following review is taken from Whiskey Reviews (http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk).Info:Platform: PCRelease Date: 11 January 2013Developer: Big Head GamesPublisher: KISS ltdWhere to get it: SteamPrice: Around £9.99Snooker is one of those great British passtimes that's perhaps not as well appreciated as its more fun-loving cousin Pool. Snooker is a game of thinking two moves ahead, calculating angles and ball travel and executing the perfect shot to ensure you stay in the lead over your equally cunning opponent. It's kind of like if chess had big red balls and a stick.International Snooker is all of those things and none of those things. It's like someone handed the task of creating a Snooker simulator to a bunch of aliens that don't understand what makes the sport great, or what makes a game good for that matter. I can't bring myself to hate the game, for every glaring flaw in every single aspect of the game I still can't get angry at it. It feels more like a dog with no legs that's bitten you, you should get angry but look at its adorable eyes, it's trying so hard despite everything wrong.Actually no, ♥♥♥♥ that. Today we're going to rip into International Snooker for the piece of ♥♥♥♥ that it is.Right from the moment you boot up the game you're greeted by ugly menu screens and an options menu that doesn't respond to anything but the left click. Pausing the game with the escape key requires you to click one of the menu options to do anything rather than the standard of hitting escape to continue.The options are sparse and I'm not even sure anything other than the resolution options did anything but playing in anything less than maximum resolution resulted in the dull grey boxes looking like Leatherface's razor blades and about as appealing.Getting into a match doesn't make the UI any better either. There's no analogue controls other than turning your aim left and right and everything is accomplished through clicking buttons and moving sliders around. There's a slider for shot power, a circular slider for where to hit the ball, another slider for cue angle and a button that you have to press every couple of shots to manually chalk your cue. It sounds fine in theory but the dull little lifeless swish sound you have to endure without any animation whatsoever every time you click it makes you acutely aware that a second of your life has just ticked away and you'll never get it back.The lack of analogue interaction has sucked all the soul out of playing. Clicking the big white circle that's supposed to represent the cue ball is just cold and impersonal in an age of analogue controllers and mice. Setting the power with a slider rather than actually making a shooting motion with the mouse or an analogue stick to set the power organically feels like you've got some kind of perfect shot cheat mode activated, especially if you have the shot guide turned on to show what directions the balls will go.It's not just the UI that's bad, there are so many other problems with the presentation.Pretty much everyone can picture the up-close texture of baize, the way it kind of has little lines in and manages to look both fluffy and smooth at the same time. Imagine the wonderful texture of it against your hand as you support the cue for a critical shot. Hold that image in your mind's eye, then chuck it out and imagine the look of soggy corrugated cardboard, the kind of cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cardboard that's practically see-through. International Snooker's tables look like they've been topped with a thin coating of Soylent Green.Equally offensive is the announcer. A soft female voice of indeterminate Scottish or Irish descent that sounds like they've overdosed on valium and are reading out numbers while waiting for death. You know you're onto a winner with your announcer when the players can hear their equal parts desperation for a paycheck and boredom at reading a script of numbers. Listening to the announcer read our your score after every shot is like staring into the abyss of soul crushing depression, or living in Glasgow.On a lighter tone the audience at least seems to have a bit of sass. Despite looking like a bunch of papier mache abominations they show a surprising amount of personality; remaining stoically silent while I scored 60 points shot after shot until at last a single member of the crowd had the audacity to clap. If the world of International Snooker were a real place I'm sure the clapee had been dragged off and quietly suffocated with Jim Davidson's ball sack. This would be fine and well if the developers hadn't gone out of their way to make sure the player feels like a ♥♥♥♥ by having the audience go wild when the AI pots a single red ball from an inch away.I've already talked a lot about the graphics and sound so I'll keep this brief. This is a game where the carpets have a more detailed texture than the cue and a sandblasted ♥♥♥ cheek could produce a more convincing reflection than the balls. The texture of which is just a flat, matte colour that makes it look like the balls are sliding around rather than rolling.Not chalking your cue every couple of shots results in an outright offensive sound effect that's like the suspension of a Robin Reliant giving way to the most depressing dogging session in recorded history in addition to your shot being less accurate and powerful. There's audio that indicates the chalk is wearing off but just like the rest it's so depressing and uninteresting that it tends to get lost in the big sucking pit of crappiness.Overall International Snooker is a functional simulation of the game but not a good one. It's graphically passable but it's the kind of game you give to someone when you want to drive them into a spiral of depression, alcoholism, self destructive tendencies and finally a crippling, fatal drug addiction culminating in getting shanked in a Pool hall by Shady Joe because they tried to hustle him for money to feed their coke habit.It's like an anti-snooker PSA in game form. It destroys any love for the sport you may have while eroding your will to live with every frame.Score: 2 out of 10 Samaritans volunteers have been called by International Snooker players.			"

												Got this in a cheap game bundle that I bought for US$1 (so dividing it out, I probably paid around $0.20 for this.)  I'm not really into billiards games, and this one totally failed to convert me. The graphics seem ok, but the UI is not terribly good and certainly nothing innovative. I suppose I got my 20 cents worth, but there's no way I'd pay more than that for it.Biggest flaw: Based on what they created, the devs seemed to be more concerned with all the crap outside of the area of the pool table than they do with the actual stuff happening on the table itself.But it's not bad, it's just not that good.

												I got this in a bundle a while back and just got the Steam key. I have played it (the non-Steam version) fairly constantly over the last year or so and I reckon it's definitely worth getting if you're into snooker.Pros: Plays well, decent physics, pretty good career mode and it's fun!Cons: A number of bugs and glitches which are easy enough to ignore in the main, but safety play is not particularly good unfortunately. This is due to the fact that the AI will either (a) immediately get out of your snooker with ease or (b) immediately foul and miss three times, forfeiting the frame. Upshot: It's not a perfect simulation (big pockets etc.)  but it is a lot of fun. It is a port from the mobile app and this shows in the controls, but for once that's in no way a bad thing. I pick it up from time to time for a frame here and a frame there and, unlike most of my backlog, this gets played on a regular basis. Be aware before you buy that it has a few quirks and you'll get your money's worth out of it. I have - many times over.			"

												I hate to do this, esp. with no real alternitives for snooker, but I can NOT recommend this game. There are some out there that complain about missing shots they *believe* should go, but thats not the issue I have. Honestly it feels similar to other pool games I DO like, and if you have played snooker in person, you understand why those *unmissable* shots actually can be missed. Snooker is not pool, the tables are longer, the pockets are tighter entery with pointed bumpers, not rounded. The game does fine representing that aspect. What kills this game is the AI. I  tested  level 1 AI for this example: You can start a game with this AI and think, rightfully so if your not a rookie, that you will destroy it, and you will....or will you? because all of a sudden, frame 2, it goes from missing most shots, to clearing the table, and intensionally using *snooker* tactics against you. This should never be a level 1 trait. I hope another deveoper with a better sense of AI development can create a snooker game that feels like this.			"

												If you enjoy a game of snooker now and again, you will enjoy this.  It's not difficult to make high breaks due to the target lines, and you can still manipulate the white exactly as you would in real life.  If you can think a shot, you can play it.  But the AI is merciless, and can also knock up a 30-50 break if you leave the table open.  This is frustrating to watch the AI pot virtually everything it goes for...but it leaves you with a massive stress and tension to try and rack up some big scores each visit (and this IS possible like I said), this tension is what you expect the pro's to feel playing against each other, so I guess this is very accurate.The REAL frustrating thing I find is the lack of fouls the AI gives away.  Most games, you would run out of position and have to cut a ball in very thin with power, so the white would ricochet around and you are praying you wouldn't foul....Inevitably you would occasionally with a bit of bad luck.  But the AI doesn't suffer from this ""bad luck"".  In about 30 frames I gave away about 30 fouls, and the AI gave away 2!!!I would definately recommend this to snooker/pool players, that think about their shots rather than just line it up and hit it...if that's the way you play, the masterful AI will beat you.

												I really like this game, it's what Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker should have been.The ball physics are spot on, if you know your snooker shots then you'll be pleased with how you can control the cueball (although it defintely takes practise). I've been a keen snooker follower and player for 25 years and you can stun, screw, top, side, check side, swerve etc if you hit it right.  Admittedly you can pull off miracle type shots that no pro would ever attempt in the real world, like a full length table fine cut from off the cushion, but then the shot IS possible to be fair so fair enough.  AI opponents are a good mix with only the very rare odd shot played from the top ranked playersYou aren't forced to moninate a colour, this makes snookers on a clour easy to get out of, that's my only critiscm.

It looks like something from 14 years ago thanks to its tablet heritage. The pool playing controls are also abysmal and just scream 'tablet' at you. However, it seems bad even for a tablet. It's a clunky mess trying to line up shots and shoot. It doesn't feel natural, you just select a power and press the button that I guess meant shoot. Everything is clunky about this game. The sounds just don't do it for me either. It's a just a confusing mess of a game with a bad interface, If you want a better snooker game: Get Virtual Pool 3. It is $9.95 rather than the astounding $12.99 It also looks a bit better and it doesn't lock away regular pool and other good features that should be available from the start and it also has snooker too.Sure virtual pool 3 is from 2000 and you can pay more and get the latest version, but if you're in the market on a budget, VP3 controls better and very intuitive, it looks about the same, it plays better and it has more options than this game does and at $3 cheaper you'd be a fool to purchase this game. I would also recommend Virtual Pool 4, but that game is more expensive and I decided to suggest VP3 because of how close the prices are. Just skip this one, these positive reviews have obviously never played a pool/snooker game on a computer before.			"

												I enjoyed the game, although it is much too easy and the physics don't seem to be realistic. I had hoped to get something like a modernized version of Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker, which is still the best Snooker game ever made. Unfortunately, International Snooker doesn't get there.Anyway, the controls are MUCH better than those of Pool Nation FX, that's why I still recommend it to players looking for some light amusement. Don't expect this game to be a simulation - it is not. But it's still a fun game.			"

												Ancient software compared to its competitors, in look, feel, sound, controls, everything! More expensive than its competitors for a game with no atmosphere. Don't waste your time or your money and don't be fooled by the screenshots. Get anything else. Anything.			"

												For the $1 I paid in a recent Steam sale, this game is fantastic value. The music, audience cheering, the refereee calling out the scores and the tournament setting all give International Snooker a great feel. I also really like the automatic save/resume feature that lets you quit out mid-frame and continue later from the very shot you left off at.All snooker fans should have this game in their Steam library.

												If you enjoy a game of snooker now and again, you will enjoy this.  It's not difficult to make high breaks due to the target lines, and you can still manipulate the white exactly as you would in real life.  If you can think a shot, you can play it.  But the AI is merciless, and can also knock up a 30-50 break if you leave the table open.  This is frustrating to watch the AI pot virtually everything it goes for...but it leaves you with a massive stress and tension to try and rack up some big scores each visit (and this IS possible like I said), this tension is what you expect the pro's to feel playing against each other, so I guess this is very accurate.The REAL frustrating thing I find is the lack of fouls the AI gives away.  Most games, you would run out of position and have to cut a ball in very thin with power, so the white would ricochet around and you are praying you wouldn't foul....Inevitably you would occasionally with a bit of bad luck.  But the AI doesn't suffer from this ""bad luck"".  In about 30 frames I gave away about 30 fouls, and the AI gave away 2!!!I would definately recommend this to snooker/pool players, that think about their shots rather than just line it up and hit it...if that's the way you play, the masterful AI will beat you.

												Buy this game its great and very cheep $2 online. Lets start a fun snooker community.  Nothing new here it's snooker after all but game is the most realistic i have ever played. Right now it would seem the Devs have just dumped this game on steam and left it. The AI is brutal but you will learn quickly. and your first 147 will feel????? I wouldn't no because i havent managed it yet but plenty have.			"

												Hi I don’t comment normally but I think this game needs a push in the right direction. It is basic but very playable, could be lots of fun if there were more players, add me as a friend on Steam and maybe we can get the ball rolling. At the moment I should not vote for this game due to the lack of online players, but I think it could be great so I will vote yes, if you like snooker download this game then add me, and we can get a great community going. Have fun; send me a friend’s request.			"

												I would've likeed to say this game is fun. However it's not the annoying and oversensitive camera is awful to say the least. The A.I. also spoils this game in the sense that even when you play against bottom ranked opportants rarely do they miss. Which means when it's your turn you better not miss, however given the awful and oversensitive camera is tiiny.			"

												Absolute garbage, do not buy this with the intentions of enjoying some good snooker as is lame as can be. Should be a free browser game. Virtually no graphics option for pc, the control mechanic is god awful as even at only 400dpi making micro adjustments near on impossible. Could be played when bored is about the best to say, then again so can anything else.Wcs was far better back on the original xbox.Total rubbish even at £4 in the steam sale. "

												Bought this game for £10 and it's definitely worth that.  A fun, chilled game that you can play to pass the odd hour here and there with no real effort. A bit like Minesweeper, but better.    If you're looking for anything more, IE - a realistic snooker sim with depth, then don't bother. If you're looking for a bit of a laugh for the odd hour or two, then this is perfect.			"

												One thing is for sure, the cue ball is very easy to pot - no matter what you do! Very frustrating. One extremely unlikely foul after another... The cue ball is definitely the easiest to pot.Physics are awful and the bots make impossible shots look very easy.I've also noticed the bot opponent lets you get many chances if it's in the lead.However, there are some good parts too. Graphics is ok, and the sound is very realistic. It's also fun, and somehow addictive - despite everything that is wrong with it.			"

												If you're looking for a full-featured snooker game with challenging gameplay, then this game delivers nothing less. However, it doesn't offer much more. The career mode is a bit half-baked, the game isn't beautiful and the AI can be somewhat hit and miss.But this is a snooker game, so on that basis I would say that this is an excellent game. The actual gameplay is near-perfect as an authentic snooker simulation. If that's what you want, and you don't need the frills, this game is a must-buy -- and a steal at the price.			"
