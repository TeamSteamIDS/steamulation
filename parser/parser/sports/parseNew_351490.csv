												Intergalactic Bubbles is inspired by a game I don't remember the name but I can still see the cursor, the dinosaur and the bubble being sent. It's not  Bubble Bobble though I think there was an arcade version with a different gameplay. Anyway, I've known this game under different names, the last one being on a giveaway game where the minigame is called Blink Shooter and is my favorite.The goal is to send colored balls on others of the same color to explode them and make sure that the board is cleaned before they're descending and touch your line. By doing so, you can also get rid of balls under them if they're not attached to another one that will support everything. Here, you have also the balls moving naturally, like if there was gravity and can also tied themselves to others and if they're the same color, you'll have another explosion that will probably help you to reach your goal.Intergalactic Bubbles is challenging because if you want to upgrade bonuses, you need to collect a sort of stars (that look more like a planet on fire anyway). Each level completed will give you one but if you do it less than the number if balls sent that will be displayed, you'll collect 3 or 2 stars.The game is kinda long if you're aiming like me to a 3 stars. The more you advance, more balls will be on the board or a new color is added.While the graphics aren't spectacular and really simple, the soundtrack is correct.I suppose that some people will be deceived by the lack of features, but it's enough for me. I find the game a little too slow, mainly in the speed at which the board is descending.If you love that kind of games, you can go for it, it's a nice disctraction.Edit: Apparently, the game was Bust-A-Move. The name itself is clicking in my head though I can't be sure if I was that.			"

												I'll keep this review brief as there is just not enough I have to say about this title.Intergalactic Bubbles is a casual puzzle game, where you have to match the same color balls to clear out a board of bubbles.It's as simple as it sounds and for the price which is a single euro this is actually quite a steal, cause to clear out all 250 levels it will take you around 14 hours and not to mention how much time it would take to a 100% which would mean that you would have to get three stars each level, which would make this game a 30+ hour game.A single euro game and a lot of play value, that sounds like a good deal right, so why am I giving it a bad score ? Well that's for the simple reason, this game is bland. Now you might say what did you expect ? Well I expected some variety through all the galaxies (50 levels for one galaxy btw). After each galaxy you get a new color ball which pops up on the board, but this doesn't really spice up the gameplay and after a few hours it gets incredibly boring. This game does have powerups which spice up the gameplay a bit, but two out of the three powerups are completely useless. The Rocket let's you switch fire a ball in the middle of the board, a rainbow ball which takes out a small cluster of all color balls and a bomb which is the only powerup you will need which takes out a massive chunk of of the board the more you level it up making it very useful in later parts of the game. In the end, I had a bit of fun with this game, I found it too boring. For people that might come along and ask well then just play it on the side, that's exactly what I did and I still got sick of it. I won't argue with the play value you get, but I still think there are way better casual puzzles game that are free in the form of flash games. Final Rating: 5/10Pros:+ Fun..Cons:-... but not for long-Most of the powerups are useless			"

												Fun ball shooter.I played a lot of this on Desura, so my Steam time is misleading.  This is a ball shooter game with a twist.  There's phyiscs that affects how the balls move.  Sometimes that ends up in your favor as a dangling trail of balls will swing back and forth and might attach to others which will activate them and make them explode.  Other times the physics is a hindrance when a dangling trail swings by at the wrong moment and grabs the ball you intended to go elsewhere.  There's an upgrade tree that you spend points on.  Get points by finishing a level in under a certain amount of balls spent.  You can replay levels any time as much as you want.3 Bonuses: Wild, Bomb, and Rocket.  Each time you make a match it starts to power up your bonus meter.  Once it is full you can choose a bonus to use.This is a slower paced ball shooter than others I've played.  I find the emphasis to be more on strategy, especially if you want to use as few balls as possible to get the 3 star rating.  And sometimes you can waste a ball if you don't wait for the ones you just shot to fall because your new ball might attach to the falling ones.There's no story, just fun arcade ball shooting.Music is nice.  I like it.Graphics are okay.  I'm not picky about graphics, though.  I find myself having to force myself to quit.  ""Just one more level!""			"

												A decent enough casual game where the aim is to fire your balls at the approaching board so that you match three or more of the same colour ball, which causes any now unattached balls to fall off as well. The idea is to clear the board in as few moves as possible, but also against the clock - or rather the board, which moves down steadily (or fast if you haven't made any matches for a few seconds).There is an upgrade mechanism to give you skills you can use to get through awkward sections of the board, which rewards playing well in earlier rounds and getting low scores - you can get up to three upgrade points per board cleared, or as few as one if you take lots of shots to win. There is also some physics you can take advantage of (or get scuppered by), if a group of balls is only connected by one ball they will hang loose and swing around, sometimes banging into other groups, which can cause a chain reaction - or block off an area you wanted to be able to fire at next.Overall it is a decent enough game to play through if you like this sort of thing, don't expect anything new after the first level - each group of levels just adds another row of balls to clear, and each new zone adds one more colour to the mix to make things harder (but resets the depth of the game board to be much shorter again at first)			"

												ok, not all the way done with this game yet, but with 210/250 levels completed @ 3 stars each, I feel ready to review it.IMPORTANT:  Do NOT buy this game if you are ANY sort of color blind. The colors of the balls starts at Red, Dark Blue,and Green, which isn't so bad, BUT...Each new ""galaxy"" unlocks a new color... THAT's the big difficulty spike, 1 more color EACH GALAXY.New colors are Light Blue, Yellow, Purple, and Orange.  Now, I'm not color blind, but I've mistaken the color of a ball several times.So, Pros:1. Pretty fun bubble-blaster game2. Achievements (long, painful grind of 250 levels for all 10 of them tho!)3. Trading Cards, including (as of this review) a cheap collection of foil cards for a foil badge (still only 100 points, but THE PRESTIGE of a FOIL badge!)and Cons:1.  Completing this game totally is 250 levels, which is many many hours of grinding the same-looking screen and music over and over and over...  I recommend Netflix and iTunes or something similar in the background while grinding this.2. This game is NOT very friendly for people who are color-blind, I can't stress this enough!  New colors of balls in each new galaxy (on top of all the previous colors) is most of the difficulty spike in each new galaxy.and one weird pro/con glitch?: 1. Occasionally (this has happened to me twice in 210 levels), a ball will glitch so bad at the corners of the game that it will set off a chain reaction of destruction that will destroy all but a few balls on that level.  This gives you a free (or mostly free) level, at the expense of messing your controls up and forcing you to exit and restart the game to regain normal controls.  Doesn't happen often enough to be useful, doesn't seem to hurt the game (aside from an almost mandatory relaunch), and will never happen when you're trying to replicate it to make a video of it to send to the developers' emails.  T_TVery very VERY fun to watch tho, as all the balls turn into oh so much confetti!  =^_^=Sure, there might be better games out there, like some other reviewers suggest, but this game has trading cards and can be 100%'ed for achievements easily enough (even if it does take longer than some other games).  At only $2 USD, that's a bargain in my book!NOTE: Don't get the 4 game bundle, only this and maybe Fragile Ball are worth it.  Maybe Fragile Ball, maybe...  but definitely Intergalactic Bubbles!			"

												A connect 3 or more bubble game, nothing too special about it, it's fairly generic although there's a tech tree added to it which gives you special abilities - however it's massively disappointing in my opinion..There's three abilities but the only one you need is the bombs fully upgraded and then putting up your energy storage and income. After the first two stages you will have enough stars (used to unlock/upgrade) to do this.This will be all you need to clear out all the levels with 3 star rating without failure every time.I do recommend playing the game if you enjoy puzzles, it's really cheap for the amount of time you can get from it but I do have a few problems with it besides the overpowered bomb ability.The game can occasionally give you the same colour ball back to back several times.The level is too randomised every time you play it resulting in some attempts being much easier when there's more/larger patches of the same colour.It doesn't really get any harder, just more balls added which prolong the level making it more tedious than challengingNothing really changes throughout the playthrough, there's 50 levels per stage and five stages which only add one new colour each.The biggest issue with this game is that it will offen forget how physics works, the balls can get stuck inside each other, spaz out and on some occasions completely break by getting sucked into some black hole where all the balls will merge into one big mess.This can result in either the board being cleared and getting an instant win, the board being cleared but not winning leaving you no way to finish or move all the balls into your shield and instantly losing.Overall the game is incredibly easy but somewhat fun if you play for small periods of time, doing it all in one go left me wishing it would finish soon.It's worth getting it on a sale or in one of the available cheap bundles with some other decent games.

												It's like one of those other bubble games, but it has something extra. First of all, this has physics. The balls have weight and that means when a group is holding on with just 1 bubble connection, the whole group just swings a bit. The momentum goes away of course, but when it first goes in motion, it can either “catch” the ball you just shot (if you shot it) or it can connect to something else and if the balls are of the same colour, they act as a ball that you shot.Second neat thing about this game are the upgrades and powerups. You upgrade your launcher to have energy which is gained by bubbles that fall down. Energy you use to activate powerups: launch ball ABOVE the “playground” to selected spot, use a rainbow ball or use a bomb. The powerups themselves are also upgradeable.There are few flaws though, but they're rather minor. Graphics are a bit bad, too though, but gameplay is what counts. Gameplay first, graphics later.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

I'm sure you've seen this game before under another name or own it on your mobile.you launch bubble down a lane and try hit 2 or more of the same color to make them pop.you win by clearing the board by popping all bubbles or making them fall down.This game add power ups & every level setup is random. by using less then a set number of bubbles on a board you can get 1-3 items that can be used to upgrade abilities but you'll need 5x each ability level to upgrade it (L1 needs 5, L2=10, ect until L5).most are things like more bubbles can touch the bottom before you lose, more energy for your 3 main abilities, and faster ways to gain energy.the 3 main attack abilities are 1)a launcher that lets you toss a bubble up into the mass. 2)a multi color bubble that will pop any 2 or more bubble it touches regardless of color. 3)a bomb that takes out all bubble in a set range. these all have upgrades and also you can unlock the ability to do 2 or all 3 with 1 bubble.

												Usually I love bubble shooter games as I think they are great time passers but this one is very very bland, basic, and really boring. For 2$ I would rather save that and open up my phone and play any of the 10s to 100s of free bubble shooter games that are better designed, and much more pleasing to play. I cannot recommend this to anyone because of its quality. I got this as a part of a bundle it's the only reason I own it. My advice to the dev(s) would be to work on its design for sure and maybe speed the game up as the first 50 levels get very boring very quick and may potentially turn off new players almost instantly.

Honestly, it only feels like ""do this one level 50 times to progress"" and this is kinda frustrating. It doesn't even get that much harder and it may be fun and a bit of ""something else"" in the beginning but it gets boring pretty fast.The ""skill"" tree stuff is pretty fun though.Summary: Regret.

												I am enjoying this game. It is the best (USD) $0.49 I've spent in a LONG time. The basic principles are easy to grasp and if you start out on a skill tree and change your mind it is easy to correct - Or just start over.It is one of those games that ""I'm just gonna play for a few minutes"" and then... ""Opps! Where did the time go?""There is one MAJOR problem though. - Like about 10% of men in America, I have ""male pattern color-blindness.""  - We see colors, we just don't always see them correctly.  So... when I get to Androdema and they ""add a color"" - The mottled Yellow and the mottled Green look almost identical.... to me. I run into this trouble fairly often with computer games. Usually when some ""vital message"" is flashed on a screen in Red... it looks grey to me. - But I'm having fun anyway.

												I like the concept of the game, but there are a few problems that I think ruin it:1) It's only partially skill-based. After the first few/dozen levels, it largely depends on what bubbles you get and when, in order to get ""full credit."" Also, you can't see the end of the level until part-way through, meaning you could be wasting your time on an unsolvable level. 2) The levels don't really mean much. Every time you retry, you get a new layout. Meaning it's all just randomly generated the whole game. The randomness of it ties into it not being skill-based.3) It's the OCD type of game where you want to keep trying until you get things perfect - which can be good - but there's no real reward. There's no plot to it, you don't have any goal you're working towards, and there's no reward other than 10 achievements. Each of those things on its own wouldn't be an issue, but it means the only point in playing is wasting time. I like the concept, and it can keep your brain occupied, but there are much better ways to waste time.			"

												Intergalactic Bubbles is a Match-3-Esque Bubble Shooter. An incredibly simple game, at its core, but, with a twist. It has about 250 Levels and will last quite a while (It took me 3 Hours to get past the first 50 Levels). This game has power ups which allow for a unique twist to the Bubble Shooter Genre. One allows you to place it anywhere in the area, one is a Universal Ball, and the other, which I forget. There is also a layer of physics here as well. You can bounce the Ball off a wall and ricochet it to hit where you want, if you're good enough to do that. Furthermore, you can upgrade the Abilities when you have points, which will give you better uses for the Ability. You can even combine the Abilities later in the game when you get far enough. I would definently recommend this game if you like the Bubble Shooter Genre. It is Cheap, fun, unique, and definently worth every penny.			"

												Intergalactic Bubbles is a Puzzle Bobble/Bust A Move puzzle game.  You match 3 bubbles of the same color to remove them from the board.  Doing so in a certain number of turns gets you a one to three star rating.  What makes this different from other puzzle games like this is the upgrades and physics.The physics are interesting for this.  Once you remove three bubbles of the same color, the surrounding bubbles sway and if they collide with three or more of the same color, boom they are removed.  You can get a nice chain reaction going if done right and everything works out in your favor.Upgrades are also interesting.  You can use rockets, bombs, and other upgrades to remove certain ""difficult areas"".  This helps you get that 3 star rating you might be looking for in a certain stage.If you enjoy this type of puzzle game, I highly recommend this.  There are quite a few levels to go through and it is different enough to make it worth your time.			"

												Oh man, this game...It’s kinda awesome. It’s incredibly simple and though there is an upgrade system the variety between sets of 50 levels is: +1 Color. So yeah, it’s brutally simple. Simplicity no matter how brutal doesn’t automatically negate fun. I’ve really enjoyed this game. It’s very zen.  I’ve been enjoying it while watching shows on amazon/netflix. It a fun little distraction of a game that isn’t as soulless as something like *insert name* clicker or candy crush.  The $2 price tag is worth it. On a very personal note the SUPER shiny bubbles have that late 90s early 00s “solve low resolution problems with shininess” thing that was popular. Very nostalgic. Anyways those are my two cents.  Oh dang, about the name of the game? Intergalactic Bubbles?? Really?? Kinda over selling it guys...hahahaha. it’s a good laugh at least.			"

												I don't know what is supposed to be ""intergalactic"" about these bubbles.  It's basically a  ""Puzzle bobble""/""bust a move"" clone without all the charm of that game.The developer has also added some power-ups that are annoying to try to use and not all that worthwhile.  I feel like this game would have been better on controller with a better control scheme for using the power-ups.  Instead you aim with the mouse, and if you want to use a powerup, you have to right click to bring up the mouse pointer, then move the mouse down to the bottom corner to click on the power-up, and then right click again to go back to aiming.Things I liked:  It's a bit more active/real time based than the original puzzle bobble    After making a shot a ""dangly bit"" can swing around and maybe make contact with more pieces to do a chain reaction. Things I didn't like so much:  The music wasn't very good and got repetitive by the 5th level.  Using power-ups is clunky and awkward  The power-ups themselves don't exactly seem all that inspired (but then again I only unlocked a few)  The whole game feels like it was done as a class project.  It doesn't exactly feel very polished.I don't really hate this game, but I don't want to thumb it up and say ""You should buy it"" because really, you'd be better off looking for a flash game version of the old Puzzle Bobble for free instead.  I would have questioned how this game made it through steam greenlight, but I think pretty much everything makes it through steam greenlight these days.Buy it cheap if you're super bored.  I will probably not even get a full hour of game play out of this. "

												Hellscape Games have pushed a Greenlight campaign for their cutting-edge preoccupation, Intergalactic Bubbles. The title is a sci-fi bubble shooter that parts full 3D representation, dynamic material science, and upgradeable powers. Really, we displayed the preoccupation a while back in the midst of Screenshot Weekly. Making the move of the customary match-3 bubble pop-a-thons and impelling them for the bleeding edge, players will end up advancing through five novel divisions of space, and seven tints to oversee. Bubbles ricochet and swing about the play field as a generous impact of air stashes approach, weakening to crush you, yet in the occasion that made sense of how to be tidied up before reaching you, stars are earned and limits can be overhauled. The odds may have all the earmarks of being against you, yet overcome them and get the advantages. As officially communicated, the addictive, 21st century style bubble shooter is on Steam Greenlight, foreseeing for your votes. Those arranged to take a gander at the entertainment can similarly go to the Intergalactic Bubbles' itch.io page where a free demo is available. The demo highlights 35 of the delight's 150 stages, endless break, and no restrictions on the redesigns that can be utilized. The redirection itself can be obtained there as well, and is starting now esteemed at half off, so it can be gotten for $3.00.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												A basic yet addictive bubble popping game that is similar to the classic ""Bust-a-Move"" game.Unlike the classic bubble popping games, this one uses a slightly angled 3D perspective, making aiming a little different as you're basically looking in the direction that you wish to shoot.The game also has a series of power-ups that you unlock as you progress and earn points. These include a bomb, a rainbow ball (acts as a wildcard ball), and force fields to name a few.Overall, a pretty good casual game.			"

												The game itself is awesome.  I like how the stars roll around and have a touch of gravity to them, or so it seems.   This is a perfect game to trance out on and just sit back and enjoy.   The music however... well... it's a mixed blessing.   I was over 100 levels in when I realized I could mute the music!!!!  I almost cried tears of joy finding this.  Did this and turned on some dubstep techno and the game was much much better. However the blessing is that the next time me and my friend Bebe are in the basement playing Lambs... I'm totally playing this game's theme music in the background.  I feel it'll add to the ambiance.   Lambs.   :DGreat game, love the spin on it, thanks for making it!   :)			"

												This game shows that adding physics won't always make a concept better.The core gameplay from Puzzle Bobble is solid and there has been many OK clones, but here the addition of physics makes it unreliable, where precision is required. For example, pre-existing clusters can be triggered by just shooting a ball in the general direction, but not consistently. Some other times, you're shooting a ball where it should bridge between two others of the same colour, but by landing it added a small gap it doesn't break because of it.Things not happening as you intended is OK if you land a shot in the wrong place, but not if it's because of the wonky physics doing its own things.

												I like this type of games.  I mean games with colorful balls where you have to match them using your quick reflexes and accuracy ( Sadly there very few of those especially for SteamOS/Linux). This game managed to entertain me for 5-15 minutes sessions, but not longer.Positive: It has many levels. It took me 14 hours to complete all levels and earn all stars Ability to upgrade / buy weapons adds some variety/tactics to game. Negative: Annoying sound effects and music Mediocre graphics Monotonous gameplay. You will get more lines (bubbles) in later levels and additional color in new worlds. Annoying  bugs: you can shoot and get stuck to falling bubbles, Restart level sometimes works and sometimes doesn't Not very well balanced.  First world was too easy. (Only 3 colors) Last 1.5 worlds were also only formality, because i already earned powerful upgrades, which helped me to gain 3 stars in all levels without any challenge.Despite more bad than goods sides  i recommenced this game for fans of Bubble Puzzle / Zuma and similar games.  Especially for price 1  EUR or even less on sales			"

												I really enjoy this game, but it's a very difficult game to review. It's one of those bubble-shooter games you find on flash game sites or the app store, except with power-ups, an isometric perspective, and physics. There's really not a lot I can say about the game due to its simplicity.It does everything right: it's incredibly satisfying to burst an enormous collection of bubbles or cause a huge area of the level to fall, the difficulty curve isn't to sharp or too slow, and the upgrades you purchase with the in-game currency (no micro-transactions here) add a reason to replay levels you didn't do well on so you can collect those few extra stars.It's just a great, inexpensive time-waster.

												This is a very average game, but has a good amount of content for the price.In the game you control a gun that can shoot balls.  Get groups of three or more balls connected and it will start a chain reaction while will destroy the oncoming wall of balls.  If the wall of balls makes it to your baseline, well, you lose the level.Pros:- The controls are very good.  The control scheme is simple, and you have a good feeling of control over your ball gun.  It is very helpful when the game performs how you expect.- The mechanics are very simple to learn and execute, and it is easy to three star levels and pull off huge combos early- That balls lower in the wall can be destroyed by knocking out the colors above them that support them leads to most of the strategy, but it is funCons:- The art isn't great- I hated the music- You will do the same thing over and over and over and over and over again- and over againIn the end, this is a somewhat fun, very casual puzzle game that is very average.  But the price is right, and it isn't a frustrating experience like a lot of other cheaper games.6/10			"

												Unity Physics bubble shooter with a few upgrades thrown in and it's 100x better than it has any right to be. A few more design passes and some polished up visuals and this game could even be called good.As it stands the game is a fun little experiment that is an absolute steal for the price. Check this out to see why it works and thank this guy for making it.As with all Epic Quest Games there seems to be a good idea lying underneath the lack of execution (either due to budget constraints or no desire to polish their games further). A couple of small things that I think would instantly make this game better:- Incentivize use of the physics to solve puzzles in less moves by making some levels have shafts of bubbles instead of the always clumped format we see currently (I realise this probably messes with your random, on a fixed seed, level design up to this point, but I think it would be worthwhile)- Balance that tech tree, some of the powers just aren't worth it. For example, I think the cannon could do with lasting for a few shots rather than the 1 it does currently.- A little more user experience polish would go a long way! Let's see a center screen popup when we have enough energy for an ability, maybe a number that pops up when we've destroyed 10+ bubbles in a single shot!			"

												I decided to play this game for the heck of it, didn't think it would be that good but I like matching games so sure. It is a simple game, mouse controls are straight forward. Menus could do a little work but gosh darn it! It is an addicting game! The mouse is very responsive and once you get the upgrades, the 1,2,3 keys are pretty much all you need. It is fun watching huge cascades fall down that you created, perhaps not completely on purpose but still very satisfing to watch. It is a little rough around the edges, like the menus and graphics but the gameplay is great and the fun factor is there, and that is all you really need in a game.			"

												tl;dr: This is ABSOLUTELY worth two bucks.The thing about a casual puzzle game is that the gameplay matters so much more than the production values. Hellscape Games is clearly a very small studio (I'm betting a single person created this in his spare time), and Intergalactic Bubbles's strengths dovetail perfectly with that.The gameplay is excellent. Imagine Puzzle de Pon and a physics engine had a baby, and you've got the idea. You fire bubbles into an ever-advancing array, trying to match groups of three to remove them and clear the board. As pieces are removed, extra pieces retain their remaining connections to the main group, but can start to wiggle around quite a bit. This creates a wonderful emergent gameplay style that complements the main puzzle beautifully. It's a genuine rush to detach a group of bubbles and send them flying into a separate group, causing a chain reaction that destroys dozens of piece in one fell swoop. The tension of seeing a large group at the end of a long thin chain of pieces and desperately trying to break that section off is captivating and nail-biting.The pacing is... less than excellent. Hellscape has confused length with depth and that puts a big damper on the festivities. It would be a lot easier to go through 250 levels of very slowly increasing complexity if those levels were more carefully designed, rather than randomly generated. If the game had half as many levels, with upgrades costing half as much, it'd feel like much less of a slog. (Even better would be a simple, more customizable settings screen instead of an awkward list of levels, but that's a much bigger change.) As it stands, this is a game I play for about an hour every six months before I get bored.The production values aren't good. They get the job done, and do very little else. That said, this is a puzzle game; you don't come here for the graphics or the sound.All in all, I'd call this game a great idea, but unpolished. That said, its current sale price is two bucks, and it's absolutely worth that. It's a lot of fun, just in smaller doses than the game seems to encourage. Keep it installed on your system, and play it just a little once in a while. You'll have a great time.			"

												Anyone remembering those Bust-A-move arcades instantly knows the vicious kind of addiction this game bears. I curse myself over and over for playing this little ♥♥♥♥♥ and not a more prestigious game off my to-do-list. One feature that seperates Intergalactic Bubbles from other Bubblepopclones, is that bubbles connected only to one other, swing physically correct - sort of. That gives the game a neat new perspective. It´s a stinker for stealing so much time, but then - hey, that´s gotta be a good game, right? Very appeasing...			"

												It plays well, it's just kind of...boring. The gameplay has been done many times before. The graphics are very simple 3D, with a plain metal playing field and only a vaguely space-esque background to break up the monotony. The music is repetitive, non-melodic synth stuff. The one reasonably innovative thing is that the spheres hang together and swing around using some simple physics.You can sit there and play for a while, and space out, and waste time...but afterwards you wonder why you even bothered.

												This bubble breaker game is a rigged bingo machine.Firstly, the bubbles have magnetic physics, which although sound helpful are actually frustrating, since each bubble's magnetic field is painfully small. This mean that sometimes you end up ""missing"" that massive combo chain of two chains because the magnetism has decided to teeter towards one chain rather than both of them, although sometimes this magnetism works in your favo(u)r, making the game basically play itself for you at least a few combos before all is still again. However, such mechanic is very annoying due to its unreliable nature, especially when you are trying to complete a level in the fewest moves possible.It also doesn't help that the camera is placed in a ""at the side of the table"" perspective, which makes it hard to see which balls are connected to each other by their weak magnetic fields.There are also power ups that should help you destroy a bunch of bubbles per use, which I haven't even been able to use because the energy recharge rate is too slow to get a power up before I end up completing a level. (You can upgrade the power ups and your energy's recharge rate etc. but you don't even need them due to how the game tends to play itself often, eliminating the need for power ups in the first place!)Overall, I have not enjoyed this game very much due to its unpredictable nature.I do not recommend this game at all, even on sale or in a bundle; You can play countless better bubble breakers online for absolutely free!

												Well, I'm torn. On one hand, this game has such a cheap pricetag that there's really no way you could could not pick this up - especially when it's on sale. If you see this game on sale pick it up; but there's a few things that irk me about it.Firstly, the thing that I'm really not a huge fan about is how simplistic everything looks, evidently the game could be the nicest looking game out there and not really change anything. What you really should note about this game is that it is so simplistic to the point that yes, it is pure brilliance. I would even go as far as to say that this game is great. The main pointers about why it's so great is because; It's cheap, it's easy to run, there's not much of a learning curve and well, it's fun.Do get this game if it's on sale. It's worth your time and money.			"

												It's a ball shooter.Visually, the game is unfinished. It looks very much like a tutorial project thrown together in a couple of hours, with little in the way of originality or effort at artistic appeal. The graphical elements are mismatched where they aren't outright untextured. There isn't even a proper scorekeeping system.If you enjoy mindless, repetitive, frustrating ball shooters, this one may not be the actual literal worst. I bought a copy for my girlfriend and will probably play many more hours of this one when I'm wallowing in a mass of boredom and depression that saps my executive functioning to the point where nothing is enjoyable, leaving little to choose between this and doing something fun besides the fact that this game can be played almost entirely without any input from my brain.I can't in good conscience advise you to spend any money on this game.

												I liked this game as first. It was a very good little puzzle game that I put a few hours into. I made it to Level 80 or so, and then the game started to cheat me. Let me explain-in the game, you need to use different color bubbles to complete sections of 3 or more bubbles that are decending down the screen. It is a pretty good concept, but poorly executed. Imagine trying to complete a line, only to find that your color never comes up. In quite a few instances, I had at least 15 in a row of the same color bubble. This glitch makes the game unplayable and I will be asking for a refund. Stay away from this game.			"

The sticky physics are what make it awesome -- big tendrils and gobs of bubbles swing and pop and fall spinning off the map. They enhance the feel of the game and, once you're used to them, they can be leveraged for tactical combos. The sorta pinball table view is a nice touch too. Very good instincts shown by this dev.

												I didnt play much so far, but I'm already in love with this Bubble Shooter game. And why is that? Read this review for god sake!! XDBut anyways, if you ever saw this game before in the store, and you thought ''Oh, just a normal Buuble Shooter game, again, meh''. I understand your reaction. I had the same reaction when I first saw the game. Then the game was in sale, and since it was like 23 cents I think, I bought it. When I first played it, oh I see, an Unity game... I wasnt expecting much now...But when I played my first game, you can, unlike other bubble shooters, combo your shots. And this is what makes the game AMAZING. Its so fun and satisfying to do these combos!!! The idea is very well-thought. This is the best bubble shooter game I ever played. But wait, theres more.The music is calm, and fits very well for a game in space (Its INTERGALATIC Bubbles). Heck, I would love to have the soundtrack actually.The controls are great and perfect. Nothing more to say. No controller support, but who wants to play a bubble shooter with a controller?The 3D graphics are very enjoyable even though they are simple. The simple look of the graphics makes the game run very smoothly, and smooth gameplay is a very good thing.In conclusion, your wallet will be very happy after you buy this game. Its worth the price. Trust me. This is probably the best bubble shooter game around. 101% RECOMMENDED!!!!!!			"

												The main difference between this game and Bubble Bobble is that the balls are dangly.I only played this game to farm cards.No one should buy this crap, but I find the positivity of its reviews hilarious.			"

												Its a neat idea.The moving balls / pool look nice at first but you will see plenty of flaws in the graphics of the balls as time goes on(they are probably using the same of the phone version desperately need to be redone)You can see what I mean by the closeups on the trailer.   Theres also a bug wherein you throw a ball while other balls are falling  and yours just falls along with them after you shoot it. I know its easily avoided but either dont allow the player to shoot it or let the new ball go through the falling ones instead of changing its directionTL:DR Its not a bad game it was just mispriced at the beginning. Graphics issue could be sorted eventually and I may update my review. Wish steam had a maybe button			"

												I played better games on my cell phone.Literally, I have Bubble Shoot on my Tablet and it's way better than this game.This game could been better, but it's lazy, the design is poor, graphics are outdated and the sound is horrible.But what can you expect from Unity?I'm sick of Unity games flooding Steam.

												I expected alot more from this bubble shooter clone, it feels too basic and plain. Too many unnecessary repetitive levels, the constant annoying tune playing in the background throughout the game,and a upgradable weaponary system to make the stages even more simplistic then it already is. I recommend you find something else to waste your time on. "

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												When I bought this game it was 3:30 in the morning and I was bored with nothing to do (you know other than going to sleep). So I decided to get a new game. I didn't have a lot of money left in my Steam account, and I need to find something with a low price. That's when I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a game. I have many fond memories of playing puzzle games similar to this one when I was younger, and the trailer of the game showed that it had to offer than the other bubble games created in the past; so I decided to give it a try. I found myself blazing through each level and having fun experimenting with the game's unique power up system. I am sure I will spend plenty of time playing this game if I find myself with a small window of free time, or I desire to play a game that is simply relaxing and stimulating for the brain. My only complaint I have so far with this game is that it bland soundtrack. I would suggest having some music that you enjoy playing in another window while playing this game.			"

												Simple but good!Intergalactic Bubbles is a bubble puzzler with a simple gameplay. They are some bubbles on the top of the screen and you have to shoot new bubbles while you make sure the colors are matching together. If you hit at least 3 bubbles with the same color, the bubble chain breaks and the bubbles disappear. When all the bubbles are gone you've won the game. To make the game a bit more exciting, there are also some features like power-ups and 5 different galaxies with a different amount of colorized bubbles. Every galaxy has 50 levels, so there are 250 levels to solve in this game.But even with the high amount of levels and some specials like power-ups, the game gets boring after a while. One reason for that is maybe the level design. All levels in all different galaxies look almost the same. The graphics do not look good in general and there are also some bugs / glitches and a miserable translation.But even with all this cons, regarding the fact that this game is a low priced game which you can buy for some cents on steam sales, it's one of the better games for some cents.All in all:+fun for some time+simple gameplay+power-ups+low price+achievement hunting+steam trading cards-not a long-term game-low graphics-sometimes buggy bubble physics-glitch with chain reaction-not for people who are color blind			"

												It's effectively a blobs clone. The fancy upgrade powers you can get don't really do much for the first stage, but by the end, the only power you need is rocket bomb. i was able to clear all of the last stage's levels with just 4 shots, due to how over powered rocket bomb is. Only get this game if you are willing to throw away six hours of your life to monotony.			"

												It's one of those 'shoot the bubble to pop other bubbles"" games that you see a lot of on Facebook and on Mobile. You shoot 'Planets' instead of bubbles, and you also have 3 Abilities. There's an upgrade menu, where you spend 'Stars', which is a currency you earn by completing levels, to upgrade various passive and active skills. You know how on mobile puzzle games, when you complete a level it gives you a rating of 1 to 3 stars depending on how well you did? It's like that here, and also has the standard square grid level select too. Each level you can earn up to 3 stars, which are used to upgrade your shield, energy regeneration and other energy stuff(energy is used to use abilities), actually purchasing the 3 abilities(they're cheap), and passive upgrades where you can use the various abilities together.The 3 abilities are: ""The Rocket"", which basically throws the Planet above the others to land it somewhere further up, useful for when you want to drop a stack but can't reach it normally. The next ability is ""The Wild"", which is basically a multi-color Planet that can be matched with any other Planet. Then there's ""The Bomb"", which is like it sounds, you shoot it like a regular Planet and it destroys all Planets in a radius(that can be upgraded).I friggin' love this game. It's really fun and really cheap too. I definitely recommend it.			"

Buy only if you're really looking to add another bubble popping puzzle game to your library.Had this game on my Steam Wishlist for a while, but waited until I saw it on sale.ProsGame is stable, and should play well on a wide range of computers.Game supports multiple languages.Swinging bubbles is a new twist to the game. Really would have liked to see the devs do more with this.Tech tree is an interesting twist on the game.ConsSome familiar mechanics are gone.Collision detection seems to have issues, and it’s hard to tell if bubbles are really touching.Scoring is replaced by a charge bar for specials.There are NO rewards outside of getting points for the tech tree for doing well.There are NO rewards for combos, trick shots, shoving a swinging chain into other balls to detonate them, etc.Graphics and UI look like they're from the 1990's.Failure state is hard to reach. It’s easier to have a mediocre, successful board instead of a losing one.My Recommendation: Buy it when it is on sale.As a fifty cent arcade game, it might be worth the price of admission. If you’re looking to find a game similar to Dynamite, or at least as good as Bubble Witch and Bubble Witch 2, you’re out of luck. The game feels like a high school or college programming project. Other than trying to max out the tech tree, there really isn’t anything to hold your attention or cause you to pick up the game. If you want it, wait for it to go on sale. "

												Really good for the price. It doesn't get repetitive, and you can play for hours without getting too bored. Each level pack adds one more colour to the set of bubbles increasing the difficulty a good bit. You can upgrade your abilities, like having a shield for when bubbles pass your turret, and being able to fire a bubble pretty much anywhere. You can also combine abilities like having a rocket bomb.			"

												As a first impression you cannot help to compare this with bust-a-move, and you'll probably only see the bad points:   * A total lack of asthetics. (Biggest problem with this game.)   * Poor graphics and sound.   * Some buggy physicsThen after a few hours you perhaps get into it. (If you are exhausted enough, or relaxed enough, or high enough I suppose.) And you'll find that the ball physics brings some pretty interesting mechanics. Such as strings of bubbles swinging around, tension and weight of bubbles-branches,  and snipping a few bubbles here or there might snap away a branch of bubbles in another direction. It's rather subtle but interesting. Sadly it's all the game has to offer.If you add a few dozen more hours you'll find that:    *All the levels are identical, with a gradial ramp up in bubbles per level, falldown speed and number of colours. (It never gets very difficult)    * The stars progression and talents are all very bland. There are a few situational elements to the skills but really nothing to write home about.    * The game is far too long for the content it has to offer.It's not a horrible game, but it needs at least a month or so of polish before it can pass the barrier from non-recommend to reccomend. Maybe something like arkaniod-style levels (where each level has a designed layout) to not make 30 hours of gameplay seem like the same 5 minutes repeated over and over again could be an idea..It took me 30 ish hours to get 100% achievments, and if I weren't such a sucker for achievements it would never have lasted that long. This is a $1 or $2 game for people listening to audiobooks while playing or are on mind numbing meds and can't think.			"

												When I bought this game it was 3:30 in the morning and I was bored with nothing to do (you know other than going to sleep). So I decided to get a new game. I didn't have a lot of money left in my Steam account, and I need to find something with a low price. That's when I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a game. I have many fond memories of playing puzzle games similar to this one when I was younger, and the trailer of the game showed that it had to offer than the other bubble games created in the past; so I decided to give it a try. I found myself blazing through each level and having fun experimenting with the game's unique power up system. I am sure I will spend plenty of time playing this game if I find myself with a small window of free time, or I desire to play a game that is simply relaxing and stimulating for the brain. My only complaint I have so far with this game is that it bland soundtrack. I would suggest having some music that you enjoy playing in another window while playing this game.			"

												An easy and nice game to spend a few hours with. Dynamics and tricks are quite simple and intuitive; background music and sounds are very nice. The special weapons and combinations added a new layer to an old-type game.PROs:- Commands and dynamics are really easy to grasp. You likely won't need the step-by-step introduction - but it's there, neverthless, if you need it.- Music and sounds. Like I said, they did a great job with it. They can be easily muted and regulated through the game, too.- Special weapons and their combinations. Nothing is as viscerally satisfying as being able to get the whole table to explode with just one move.CONs:- The level of simplicity. Really, the whole game is almost too easy. You get almost at once the right, intuitive combination of exploding bubbles and special weapons needed to pass the harder levels. Conversely, the last sector is literally impossible to win with full stars and without special weapons; you'd need to try and try and try again until you get a lucky screen.- The colours. Blue, green and red, all right. But, add the yellow one to the mix and it gets really hard to pick them apart - and I'm not even vaguely color-blind. (And then comes the orange... no, really. There were moments when I had to stop and look at them a second time.)Going just by genre, I'd say 8/10. As a more general vote, a nice 7/10. I'll be likely re-playing this sometimes soon and I've already suggested it to other players.			"

												Got this in a bundle and is a fun time killer. I would reccomend unless you are color blind like myself. First set of stages was fine since the swirls on green and red are very distinct. Now that im in the second set of stages and they added ...yellow? the game has become extremely hard for me. Now 3 of the 4 colors they have chosen for the balls look almost identical besides for the swirls, and the swirls look similar on the green and yellow. This has caused my progression to slow down to slow grind and all it would take to fix is just a option to add a different pattern on the ball or color blind friendly colors. This is something that is overlooked in way too many games.			"

												Intergalactic Bubbles is a bubblepopper+It's main virture are physics. Floppy bubbles make for great plays, and being able to shot something falling down is nice addition+It's talent tree, while simple, is nice. Skills are quite balanced, each serving different niche (though rocket is a little better than others IMO) , and they combine later in the game+It's quite fun+It's cheapBubble breaking sounds, while good, could be better. They might be annoying for some. Neutral-Underscores IN EVERYTHING, from the menu to talent tree to how to play to each single thing other than playing are so obnoxious. Also, talents aren't described, which isn't good, especially if i were to show this game to a ~5years old-Music is VERY repetitive, and it's VERY bad.-Randomness of levels is annoying, it shouldn't be that way.-More colors should appear earlier.-For game with such a nice talent tree, collectible powerup bubbles would be nice addition (and are quite common in other ""space"" bubblepopper games)Don't get me wrong, it's nice game, especially on few first levels. Physics are really funny. But the game shows laziness on almost every step. I wonder how it isn't beta. And developer isn't making any patches. I wouldn't recommend to buy it, but if you get it it isn't THAT bad4/10			"

												Intergalactic Bubbles is hardly an original game design; it's one of those simple games that get cloned ad nauseam, like Arcanoid or Tetris. Nevertheless, such clones are invariably entertaining because their core idea is so good, and if they manage to give it some nice twist, they can expect some real popularity.This is exactly what Intergalactic Bubbles does: by taking the concept of ""put balls of the same colour together to make them disappear"" and adding real physics, as well as some special moves and buyable upgrades, it provides a surprisingly good gaming experience. Yes, each level is virtually the same, but it's just this kind of game - it's pointless to expect anything else from it. It is what it is, and the repetitiveness is a feature like any other, not a shortcoming. What matter is that it's fun to shoot the balls, look for combinations, buy new skills and watch the balls swing quasi-realistically (hopefully with unexpected combos).The game has no major weak points, but the graphics aren't exactly pretty, which is a shame for this kind of game (especially visible on Steam cards, which I've melted to crystals as soon as possible before my eyes could bleed). I also have some reservations regarding balance of power-ups (for example, bomb costs more energy despite being less useful than multi-coloured ball), but it has very little impact on the actual gameplay.To sum up: Intergalactic Bubbles is a game for many, many evenings, but only if you don't mind doing the same thing over and over. But it never hurts to try, especially since the game is addictive as hell.			"

												Many many years ago my grandmother had an old bubble popping game on an old-old-ancient desktop computer. I used to play it for hours.  This is just like that, but better.  Worth the 2 bucks, imo.  It's a great little time waster when you don't want a deeply involved game.			"

												Not too fast-paced - a sweet Match-3 game.I was, however, GREATLY IMPRESSED at the trick shots that are possible. You've got skill? You can make some pretty slick moves. And THAT is a satisfying experience, when you pull one off!I've spent 10 times as much on other games, and haven't had as much fun. I wanted to write this review in support of a simple, subtle, tidy game about focus and called shots. (I went through levels like potato chips.)I'd love to see a sequel, with variations or deeper power-ups and abilities. I'd love to see this get attention. Thanks, developers - - cool stuff.			"

												A nice, fast-paced Bust-A-Move/Snood type game, with attractive 3d spacy marbles.It feels a bit more frantic than its predecessors as the marbles are constantly moving toward you at a steady rate, rather than moving a fixed distance every time you make a move, so you can't take as long as you want to line up the perfect shot. Also, the marbles fire at a rather high velocity from your gun, and the physics mean targets may swing wildly for a while before they settle, which creates an interesting departure from the originals.Plays smoothly on Linux.[Bought at significant discount during 2015 Holiday Sale]			"

												It's one of those 'shoot the bubble to pop other bubbles"" games that you see a lot of on Facebook and on Mobile. You shoot 'Planets' instead of bubbles, and you also have 3 Abilities. There's an upgrade menu, where you spend 'Stars', which is a currency you earn by completing levels, to upgrade various passive and active skills. You know how on mobile puzzle games, when you complete a level it gives you a rating of 1 to 3 stars depending on how well you did? It's like that here, and also has the standard square grid level select too. Each level you can earn up to 3 stars, which are used to upgrade your shield, energy regeneration and other energy stuff(energy is used to use abilities), actually purchasing the 3 abilities(they're cheap), and passive upgrades where you can use the various abilities together.The 3 abilities are: ""The Rocket"", which basically throws the Planet above the others to land it somewhere further up, useful for when you want to drop a stack but can't reach it normally. The next ability is ""The Wild"", which is basically a multi-color Planet that can be matched with any other Planet. Then there's ""The Bomb"", which is like it sounds, you shoot it like a regular Planet and it destroys all Planets in a radius(that can be upgraded).I friggin' love this game. It's really fun and really cheap too. I definitely recommend it.			"

												Intergalactic Bubbles is a bubblepopper+It's main virture are physics. Floppy bubbles make for great plays, and being able to shot something falling down is nice addition+It's talent tree, while simple, is nice. Skills are quite balanced, each serving different niche (though rocket is a little better than others IMO) , and they combine later in the game+It's quite fun+It's cheapBubble breaking sounds, while good, could be better. They might be annoying for some. Neutral-Underscores IN EVERYTHING, from the menu to talent tree to how to play to each single thing other than playing are so obnoxious. Also, talents aren't described, which isn't good, especially if i were to show this game to a ~5years old-Music is VERY repetitive, and it's VERY bad.-Randomness of levels is annoying, it shouldn't be that way.-More colors should appear earlier.-For game with such a nice talent tree, collectible powerup bubbles would be nice addition (and are quite common in other ""space"" bubblepopper games)Don't get me wrong, it's nice game, especially on few first levels. Physics are really funny. But the game shows laziness on almost every step. I wonder how it isn't beta. And developer isn't making any patches. I wouldn't recommend to buy it, but if you get it it isn't THAT bad4/10			"

												As a first impression you cannot help to compare this with bust-a-move, and you'll probably only see the bad points:   * A total lack of asthetics. (Biggest problem with this game.)   * Poor graphics and sound.   * Some buggy physicsThen after a few hours you perhaps get into it. (If you are exhausted enough, or relaxed enough, or high enough I suppose.) And you'll find that the ball physics brings some pretty interesting mechanics. Such as strings of bubbles swinging around, tension and weight of bubbles-branches,  and snipping a few bubbles here or there might snap away a branch of bubbles in another direction. It's rather subtle but interesting. Sadly it's all the game has to offer.If you add a few dozen more hours you'll find that:    *All the levels are identical, with a gradial ramp up in bubbles per level, falldown speed and number of colours. (It never gets very difficult)    * The stars progression and talents are all very bland. There are a few situational elements to the skills but really nothing to write home about.    * The game is far too long for the content it has to offer.It's not a horrible game, but it needs at least a month or so of polish before it can pass the barrier from non-recommend to reccomend. Maybe something like arkaniod-style levels (where each level has a designed layout) to not make 30 hours of gameplay seem like the same 5 minutes repeated over and over again could be an idea..It took me 30 ish hours to get 100% achievments, and if I weren't such a sucker for achievements it would never have lasted that long. This is a $1 or $2 game for people listening to audiobooks while playing or are on mind numbing meds and can't think.			"

												I got this game because it seemed fun and simple; match three bubbles, get rid of bubbles, win. As I played it, I quickly realized that it was just that simple, yet somehow, so much more. I frothed, I raved, I swore. I was able to create inexplicable combinations, yet the most basic of shots elluded me. Perplexed, I vowed to never again feel that bitter sting of defeat. Not to these bubbles. And thus, I began to hone my skills.As I began to take this spiritual journey deep within the confines of that digital arena, egged on by soothing music reminiscent of puzzle games from my childhood, time seemed to slow. Nay, it seemed to halt for me alone. I could vaguely hear my family calling my cell phone, my boss to inquire of me as it had been three days of my absence, and it was unlike me. I could hear weeping, but was it myself, or the ones I loved?My family grew older, and larger, friends mourned for me, and yet I remained transfixed by this game, untouched by the hands of time. I lost my job yesterday, or was it perhaps ten years ago? The concept of hours, days, even years has become lost to me as I still hone myself, becoming a master of the bubbles. They called to me, speaking promises of glory and victory, and I refused to deny myself that which I so dearly desired. I would never bow to these colorful orbs as I had once in my youth. Youth? What did that even mean anymore? I have been here centuries now, unhindered by the pains of old age, frozen in my prime, learning the ways of the bubbles. Even death itself has forgotten me as I remain transfixed by this game. My family that I knew had passed on, leaving me alone, yet astoundingly without resentment; the woman they had known had been gone all of these millenia. And now, this very day, I stepped out of that plane of existance changed; born anew in the fires of reds, greens, and blues. My life as I had known it is forever gone, and I alone, save for the holy knowledge that the bubbles have bestowed upon me, remained. I shall go forth, and conquer. TLDR; Really addicting game. I totally recommend, but only if you are willing to lose your day to playing it.			"
