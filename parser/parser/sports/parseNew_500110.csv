								i love flight Sim's and  Pilot Wings for the N64 so if you have moderate resistance to Sim sickens like me you should love this game. now I'm not saying it is perfect but for a early access game it is a much better base product than most and if it receives a steady stream of updates it will be amazing "

								Hi Joey,Great Title! Thank you.After playing it for a while, here are some of my suggestions/feedback.The glider needs to be closer and the rainbow needs to be killed off totally. I get really bad stutter when the rainbow is in the picture. I use the Gigabyte EXTREME Liquid cooled 1080 GTX. Quad core 4.2 GHZ proc and 16 megs of ram. The other island runs perfectly. I would also recommend changing the animated clouds, as they have lots of weird shapes around them. Also, a man after my own heart, Games never have enough ambience. You are on the correct path sir! The storm was great when it hit me! We need more stuff like that... birds..whales..ships..bugs..people overlooking cliffs..campfires..schools of fish..etc..the list goes on and on. This game will be incredible when out of early access. I am more than willing to help out, as I have been creating art all my life :} I know you have just added and artist to your team. So..I am sure, some major grafx updates will come soon enough! Also, the wind thermals need better art sir. I would personally love the choice of using controls also, not just move my head for turning. I would love it if i could just hold the vive wands in front of me, like i would be holding the pole, and steer..just like in real life :} Being that you named this Glider island, did u plan on any other types of machines ? Rocketbelt, mini motorized gliders, Skydiving..etc. I can easily seeing this game hitting top sales when completed. What you have done so far is epic to me! Cannot wait for your finished version. Thank you again Joey. I will play again after work..test some more..and contact you asap. I had sent you my email this morning also :]Thanks for knowledge and helping me with my project also!You are to kind sir!I hope the sales go up and up for you! "

								Better than I thought ir would be. I remeber when it first came out it recieved some negative reviews because of it's head tracking only control. I bought it after haptic feedback Vive controllers option was added. The way it let's you align the craft to exactly where you need it to be and the overall sensation of gliding around both work great. Nice addition to add some variety to your collection.			"

								I don't write many reviews and you may be looking at what I'm saying here and thinking ""hey you only played 15 minutes... what do you know?""I pretty much saw all this game had to offer. You start at the top of an island mountain, run off the edge of some kind of plank, and then fly trying to collect rings. That's it. That's the whole game. Some rings are worth more than others... why? Cuz. The motion controls, moving your head to turn, dive and climb... AWFUL! Who thought that up? A game that may require quick manuvering and as much control as possible... LETS STRAP A 2 POUND DEVICE TO THE FRONT OF THEIR FACES AND THEN HAVE THEM MOVE THEIR HEAD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AS WILDLY AS POSSIBLE TO FLY A HORRIBLY UNWEILDY AIRCRAFT! BRILLIANT!I hope that person got a raise. MY NECK IS KILLING ME! Getting an ice pack, some bio-freeze and a refund. VR shouldn't hurt.			"

								Of my 70+ Vive games, this is my second favorite, next only to Smashbox Arena.  I have always loved flying games, especially gliding ones, but this one makes you feel like you're actually on the mountain!  The complaint of 2 of the 3 negative reviews was that the movement was controlled by the head.  This was changed months ago, and you now control it by moving your hands, just like on a real hang glider.  This is more natural, and lets you look around at the scenery.  Several of my friends and family and tried it, and they have all enjoyed it.The graphics are clean and polished, and it's well worth the $10.  I'll never forget the first time I stepped off the ramp at the top of Glider Island and dove down the mountain.  It was such a rush!Most or all of the other glider-like flying VR games are arcade style, and just move you at a constant speed. This one feels like the real thing.			"

								I so wanted to love this game as I was a big fan of Pilot Wings on the N64!I suggested the developers should find and play it for inspiration, it was very similar (and to fix the controls as it was head movement only initially).It appears they did, or something similar, because the revised, updated game, which I played recently is so much better than the first release.The controls are really well implemented now with a choice of Xbox controller, head movements, or you can use the VIVE controls to fly it like a real hang glider.My only small complaint now is that I find it a little too hard to complete the levels, and with no way to access the other two island until you have completed the first level I found that I was extremely frustrated that I HAD to do the first one. I experienced a problem where my BOOST function on the XBox controller wouldnt kick in so it was impossible to do the first level, and so have not seen the others. I am sure this bug will be fixed soon, and I will have another go at it.The graphics and sound are great, there is a real feeling of flying a hang glider. Now they just need to add the other N64 Pilot Wings vehicles like the jetpack and microlight and I will be really happy.			"

								I just tried this out for half price. I would say 5$ is much more reasonable. Its a relaxing experience none the less. Enjoyable to fly around and collect hoops. Although I wish there was more to the gameplay. The Vive hand controller method was a little tricky at first. But fun. I actually enjoyed the head controls more... Its easier and more relaxing. I am interested in seeing the newer version, Overall I feel this developer has potential.			"
