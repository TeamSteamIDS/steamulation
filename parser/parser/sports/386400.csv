												I'm sorry but I can't recommend this game.I think the graphics are good enough, the game options decent (career mode, quick play and online) and customisation options are nice as well (once you unlocked them by playing a few games).What I dislike are the controls and the physics which are by far the most important aspects of the game. Issues with controls:Playing with a controller felt clunky and not intuitive to me so I mainly used keyboard & mouse controls. You always control all 4 of the poles at the same time which may result in unwanted shots on your own goal if you hit your own player while moving the mouse. I would like to choose which poles to move at any given time so I can position my defense while attacking with the middle and attack poles for example. Hold buttons 1 and 3 to move pole 1 and 3 or hold button 4 to move only pole 4 for example. There could be issues with keylocking keyboards but maybe there is a way to implement something like this. The expert mode kinda tries to do this but only seems to work with a controller.*EDIT* With the latest update (v1.03) some changes addressing this issue were introduced. While I haven't gotten to test them out myself (still waiting for a demo to avoid the buy-refund-cycle), they seem to be a step in the right direction. At least the developer seems to be involved with the community and striving to improve the game.Issues with physics:The ball behaves weird and the hitboxes sometimes feel a bit odd. It doesn't feel like the ball is truly rolling around the playing field and it sometimes gets stuck, diverted or slows down without an obvious reason.I really wanted to like this game and waited a long time for a game like this but this just isn't it... yet. It sure has potential and I will gladly give it another try if it gets updated and improved but for now I will have to get a refund. Asking price (at least with current 30% discount) would be fair if the game wouldn't have the issues I mentioned. Unfortunately I can't enjoy it in its current state. :/A demo would also be nice...

												Foosball: World Tour:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This game sends me back to my childhood! I actually used to have a Foosball table in my bedroom (“Baby-Foot” in French - go figure!) and used to hold tournaments with my close friends. Boy, this was fun!Foosball: World Tour is a casual Football game simulation where you play the world game (Football) on a specifically made table with four rods on each side of the table: 2 rods in defence, 1 rod in the middle field and one rod for the attack. The aim of the game is to score the most goals against your opponent on the other side of the table.  On the single playing mode, you will be able to play in 20 different locations around the world. Each location will have a certain level of difficulty (from easy to master), different types of table (French, Retro and more) and different type of balls.  You will have a variety of objectives; it may be the first one to reach 10 goals, or you may have 10 balls per game and whoever scores the most goals win the game.At the end of each game you will be awarded up to three stars; accumulate as many stars as possible and you will be able to unlock trick shots, such as snake, pull, tic-toc and pin shots. You also can customize your foosmen from Mafia to Hotdogs!It will take you a little bit of time to get used to the controls regardless of whether you are using the gamepad or the mouse and keyboard. Whatever you prefer to use, expect accidentally score plenty of own goals for your opponent, which can be a bit frustrating! The graphics are decent and you have a good soundtrack.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Fun to play-	Unlock trick shots-	Single and online mode-	Good soundtrack-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls will take you time to master-	No Single player tournament-	No trading cardsFoosball: World Tour is a fun and competitive game; it will no doubt bring you some great memories!7/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupDisclaimer: The copy of this game was provided by the developer for review purposes, yet it doesn't affect my review in any way.Few words about the gameFoosball: World Tour - the game that will bring back tons of memories of times when playing it in real life was one of the best and most fun activities with friends. It's kind of a simulation game of Foosball (table version of football) , where you're able to challenge other people, locally or in multiplayer mode, or just play against various difficulties of A.I. Advantages - Variety of customization possibilities - Graphics are surprisingly up to date - Exceptionally good and precise controls, especially on controller - Music makes players pumped to play - A.I. is well made, playing on medium difficulty matches an average skill of beginning player in my opinionDisadvantages - Physics of the ball desperately need some fixes, sometimes it behaves like it's haunted - The idea of controlling every rod causes a ton of own goalsSummaryThis is a nicely done game, based on a simple concept that would be an amazing thing... only if not those two, some might say - little inconveniences. Unfortunately, those two cons make the game very hard to master, as ball behaves unpredictably and there's no way to pass the ball between your lines due to control over all of them at once (it's hard to explain perfectly, but I think that all of you will figure out what I'm talking about :) ). Excluding those discomforts, the game is very fun, especially with other local players. It also offers a ton of customization options, like tables, balls, match settings or ""foosmens"" and a level system in online multiplayer (which I unfortunately didn't get to test out yet as I couldn't find anyone playing it). So yeah, the game is good and fun to play, the only underdeveloped thing are the physics of ball which is annoying but not bad enough to have any major impact on gameplay. Game - recommended :)Personal score7.5 / 10

												I was very concerned about the controlsBut sooner than I've expected I was enjoying the joystick analog sticksI'm pleased, the smoothness and responsiveness are goodIt allows the player think about positioning before shooting and the visuals are according tooIndeed, some physics details were ignored but they did a great job adapting from a mechanical to digitalI just wished it had more customized content and some tauntsMaybe we can see a new way to control invidually the barsThe OST and sounds effects are okOverall score 7.5/10			"

												Game is very good and accurate... it has some few collision bugs and i think that the devs could use  better ideas for  how the control on gamepad should be little better. There are a lot of good ideas for it. specially for total freedom of moviment. Even in expert controller i feel a little ""stuck"", it should smoother with a few patches.Graphic is very good and fits perfectly the nowadays standard.Online is totally empty, but it´s passable because it is the very first selling day, so i hope we have more people to buy the game and test.Very fun, it needs only a few fine tunning to become almost perfect.

												Controller Breaker Simulator 2016. No really, you spam to win. Repeatedly flick the right stick in the general direction of the goal and you'll come out ahead. There may be some more strategic potential to this game, but I haven't found it yet. The reason why spamming works is because if you try calm and calculated shots, the ball usually just rolls past your foosmen. The physics of blocking aren't very advanced, nor are they adequate. The ball just like, slows down as it hits your guy. It's like your men are made of semi-permeable membrane.Mouse/KB controls are extreeeemely sensitive and way to easy to own-goal yourself. I agree with the other reviewers though. Good soundtrack, sufficient graphics, Settings are decent, I ran it natively at 21:9 resolution (2560x1080). 6.5/10 because no one else has done Foosball as a video game this well yet. But it needs work for sure.			"

												This is the same game that was release on PS Vita and PS a few year ago.  Controlling the ball is not intuitive and takes time to master.  But once you get the hang of it, the game is very enjoyable.  Of course it's nothing like playing Foosball on a real table, but it's fun, and not very expensive.			"

												I like the graphics but the gameplay needs some work. The kicks need to be more responsive. The back 3 really need work.  The shots end up going the wrong way and its really tough to have any control.  The game does have potiential if there are changes made like making banks shots work right			"

												Refunded :/Haven't played a game this bad in a long time. There were just too many negative points to even enjoy this, even though I love Foosball itself.- The controls felt completely off, it either reacts too fast or not at all- You move all player rows at once and end up shooting against yourself more often than you'd like- The ball gets hit or even shot when it clearly didn't even get touched (bad Hitbox)- ""Trick shoots"" act on their own, you don't even need to do a thing but press a button to score a goal- In Career Mode, especially the earlier levels, bots are playing more against themselves than you- Playing with a controller, you literally don't even need to do anything but shoot to win games, it's THAT easy.A few good aspects are:+ It's Foosball. + The graphics are alright+ Some shots are nicely animated+ There are a few game modes to choose fromBut really the gameplay didn't get me, sadly I cannot recommend, I even went as far as to refund it. It's a nice idea, but it takes a lot to successfully turn a controller/ keyboard+mouse into a Foosball table and unfortunately this game didn't manage to do that.			"

												A very well optimised and fun game to play, have a look at the gameplay. You use right analog to shoot by the way, it took me longer than expected to find that out even after doing the tutorials.

												I really can't recommend this game to anyone who actually knows how to play foosball.First of all, you don't control your players almost at all - you controll the ball if it is NEAR your players. It makes almost no sense and it also makes defense just wiggling everyone up and down until the ball sticks to your guys.You can't control the verticality of the ball either, it is all automatic based on what the game thinks is right.The special shots are damn near useless as well because the trajectory is pretty much random.You could tell early on this is most likely a ported portable crap game because it has the 3 star system - and to get a 3 star you have to wipe the floor clean with 5-10 goals without getting scored on.Definitely pass on this game until a real foosball sim comes out.
