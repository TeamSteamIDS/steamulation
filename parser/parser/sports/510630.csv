												Horrible game play. Completely unreasonable way to ""sign"" players which is essentially just ""Pay us money and you can have anyone""Give it a try as the download/install takes 2 minutes. Although it is a reflection on how the game is. Lacking depth and without spending money you are litterally just watching results roll in.			"

												To clarify: you don't need to pay to enjoy this game. In game cash (non-purchaseable) can be used for transfers, stadium upgrades and everything else you'd expect. I think the majority of negative reviews are from people who have seen that players CAN be bought with credits, but haven't stayed in the game long enough to see that you can buy them with IG funds aswell. So again, this game can be played and enjoyed WITHOUT paying. Now for the actual review: This is a free game, so limit what you actually expect from it. Agreed, it looks like the Championship Manager games from the last decade, but what can you expect - it's free! You want a nice UI and tons of in-depth features? Stop being cheap and get Football Manager (or other purchaseable alternatives). My review is positive not because i will sink hundreds of hours into it, or because it's a sophisticated management simulation, but because it's a free game with full 2016-2017 squads, it has a functioning UI, is stable, and has enough features to be an enjoyable jump-in experience for an hour at a time. If you want 10+ hours of enjoyment, you're going to need to invest in an alternative. But don't complain that it's impossible to play without paying - you're wrong. Ignore the negative reviews that only cite this one issue.			"

												this game is great to pass time, i see in the comments alot of people claiming that to sign players you have to buy tokens with actually money, that is false. depending on the club you choose you get varied starting money. for exaple Celtic in the SPL starts with 4 million whereas torquay united in the english 3rd division or whatever it is has 300k to start with. every game your clubs balance changes depending on things like icket sales and player wages.i also saw a comment that claimed he bouhgt tokens and used them to buy players but his club rapidly went into debt. thats becausse his club could not sustain the wages of the players he bought so naturally he lost alot of money each game. however you get bonus money for winning tournaments etc. you dont have to buy tokens in this game to play it although there is the oppertunity to do so			"

												Full of bugs.Game data issue - It's not instinctive to save when there's an auto save every now and then, so I finished my first season, it saved after my European final but before it simulated all the pre-season events. Played through a few days of pre-season then closed the game. When I came back, a player that retired didn't retire, and the whole Champions League and Europa League had already been simulated, so I had the Europa League trophy for that season even though I qualified for the Champions League.Player potential issue - I get my scouts to do some scouting and I see a young player with potential rating of say 95-99. When I get him, his potential rating shown by my youth academy is lower, say 88-92, and this can change again as you upgrade the academy. Would have at least expected my own coaches to have a good estimate. Too uncertain for you to get value for money out of youth transfers, and no explanation for this even though I've searched.Unrealistic games - Red cards and penalties occur way too often in the game.

												Great game. Some say it's pay to win but it isn't actually. Ok, there is options to pay with real money but it's not like you MUST in order to play the game. With real money you can get more cash for your choosen team and buy any player you want instantly but.. where's fun in that? Isn't all about having fun and challenge and see how good you are in management? Personally didn't spend a coin on this game and these are my best achievements: In 3 seasons I managed to get into CL final with Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb(players rank 82-88), on the way to beating teams like Bayern, Atl.Madrid, Chelsea and losing in final 4-2 to Real Madrid cuz of individual quality. In 3 seasons I won La Liga with Celta Vigo(players rank 85-91). In 2 seasons finished second in Seria A with Sampdoria(players rank 84-90) and won Coppa Italia. Currently in 2nd season with Southampton(players rank 86-92) trying to win Premier League. You don't need best ranked players, you can make your own through training and matches. So you only need some time to find out best tactics and be smart enough to use it. And sometimes, you need luck, ofc :). That's it from me, now excuse me, going to put fingers on ice			"

												Very good football manager simulation game. Its free and seems to be even better than Football Manager to me as they dont tack on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D graphics that are ugly, they just stick to text/2D style which is much better.A lot of false reviews say you must pay for transfers. This is not true you can play this game 100% free. Of course there are going to be OPTIONAL micro-transactions in a F2P game, how do you expect the devs to make some money back? Its only fair and once again, it is completely optional you can sign big players if you're a big club, so its realistic.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes football.			"

												This game is perfect for anyone who wants to get a football/soccer manager game that's free. As most games cost high ammounts of money. But there is only 2 negative things i need to say to improve. Improve goalkeepers they don't save anything any shot that happend goes in. And also give us more money to start off with teams like madrid and barca should start with like $90m not $30m. Other than that this game is very good and i suggest to get this game :)			"

												Personally, I only think a few tweaks to the game would make it a better game imo. Most of these aren't too big a deal, but one is kinda frustrating that I haven't seen brought up. (And yes, I spent too much time on this game, but that isn't the point)The only major thing is crosses and long shots. With crosses, 9/10 they'll fumble into the net and you'll wonder how they didn't save it, as they always seem to go over the keeper, no matter who they are (I've done this to Petr Cech) and long shots, I mean halfway line/Byline ""Shots"" That the keeper hits into his own net. If there is a way to fix that then that's the main annoying part I found gone. Just quickly, a few things I think would be nice for the game, for example sackings, or the board expectations are pointless, making the game harder (I got Dumbarton up to the Scottish Prem and won it in 4 seasons, with two cups along the way) and the board updating their expectations after a season (I know I said that it is pointless, but avoid relegation, get a 6 place finish in a 10 team league, and win the league next season?)But like I said, the only main problem is the Crosses/Long shots, but it's just what I think needs improving.

												Game is fun for a while but as with all managers it gets repetative very soon...You can pretty much start in league 2 and go straight to premiership in 3 seasons every time np...And a tip for ppl that play and like to play in lower leagues buy all the old players if u want top new young players cos once those ppl retire u can click on their old names and shows you the new kids cos they reroll them u should get same quality player and same position like the retiring players... so make sure u buy carvalho klose etc... from free agency theyll retire after a year and ull get 2 new under18 top class talents...

												I'm going to start off by saying that this game is much better than I thought it would be.I played Soccer Manager 2015 and 2016 and I wasn't entirely impressed by them. I felt they were lacking and had a few problems that seem to have been worked out. *Note - This isn't anything close to how Football Manager is, so don't go in expecting that.I'm currently playing the game as a placeholder I suppose for the lack of a better name until Football Manager 2017 comes out. You can start off with any team you want. Player ratings are done a bit weird, but it isn't a big deal. For the most part, transfer budgets are fairly small (about 20ish million). That budget is the norm for all big teams as far as I know. You can purchase 'Cash Injections' but you really don't need too, it is very easy to make money (Raise youth players and sell them, bring in players on free transfers and sell them, sell fringe players, etc. If you're losing money every month then that means you have a player who has a very large wage and you don't have enough cash so becareful of that.) The game does 1 thing that I've seen never before in Football Manager: Players arrive late for training and don't perform well. I thought that was a cool and interesting feature, and funny when it was Nicklas Bendtner that did it.Games go by very quick, not much to them. Pick one of the few formations available, set few tactics, and you can assign player roles. All games are done on a 2D match engine. I'd love to see a 3D match engine.Transfer tips: Sign Christian Pulisic and take a look at the free transfers, you can get Martin Caceres and Alex on a free in the first season and some other decent mid to high 80 players.I'd love to see the microtransactions disappear. I wouldn't mind spending 10 - 15 bucks on this game to have no microtransactions and a 3D match engine.One last thing, I'd also love to see a redesigned UI and more information on players and clubs, in similar fashion to Football Manager.

												(By Tyreese Baird II)I have been playing SM17 for a few weeks and would recommend it to anyone. It has loads of options and the matches are very exciting. Being very young there are not many games I can just get on steam but I think SM17 could pass easily for something that costs £9.99.Overall a couple more things to do would improve it but it is realistic and addictive which is what I think is important in a good game.

												Since it's free, you shouldn't expect much. I played it like around 10 seasons perhaps, reaching the status of pretty much basically winning almost every single game until the game bugged out on me. At first it started to show points and game results of previous seasons randomly. I kept going. Was unable to continue when in addition to the messed up tables, it one day kept giving me notifications and memos of all kinds. You kept clicking to continue but they just kept appearing more and more. Can say I beat the game I suppose, since it went crazy on me :) Was fun till it lasted...			"

												This game is fun and almost perfect however there are a few key things that prevent it from being as fun as it should be.          1. Red cards are a big issue, you can barely go a game without getting one and whenever you do your player is suspended for 3 games instead of 1, so a simple tweak to fix the red cards given and the punishment length should be easy.2. Transfers are always losses, when you put a player up for sale no matter how old or how talented the other clubs try to pay you so much less than they are worth and will not budge any more than 250,000 however when you try and buy players from other clubs you are required to pay much more than they are worth so I suppose it prevents people from making millions and buying OP teams so that you can get more tokens purchased but seriously having to sell players for 2 million and then buying a player who if you every sold would probably sell for half his price is just unfair.3. Other transfer issues, a strange issue with the transfers is that even after the window closes you can still sell your players and make money so that at the next opening you have some money. However I feel like this makes the game a little too easy if you just sell all of your reserve players to buy one good player at the transfer opening.I would say that overall this game is amazing and very fun but just those few small tweaks and the game is all set!

												Waste of time. This game is clearly pay to win, especially makes it hard to win games knowing that majority of people that play this in multiplayer mode, do so by paying actual money which puts you at a disadvantage unless you want to try doing some surveys or reccomending this game to friends which is just pointless.It can be fun to watch the matches if you play the right setting but overall I'd rather just play an actual soccer game rather than this garbage.

												Terrible. I don't like the idea of writing a review after such little time but I can't see myself even giving this game a chance. For starters, the UI is a mess. Nothing is organized, the design is dirt cheap, and it runs like a laggy flash game. You can tell there was literally no effort put into this. Nothing is where you expect it to be, you can't do simple things like click back or forwards through pages, all of the symbols and icons are poor choices. You can barely read player ratings. Trying to judge players is more work than it should be. There are so many choices but I feel like there really is no strategy or depth to the game in any way. In the first two games I played with two seperate clubs, my players received 3 red cards. ""????????"" The game is loaded with upgrade options that can be bought with coins so I see why what the scheme here is: put literally zero effort into game development, label it a free Football Manager, then try to sucker in cash through a coin system.

												Soccer Manager 2017 has been released and I am writing this review on 9/16/2016The current team I'm managing with this simulator is Borussia Dortmund.This manager game for the sport of Soccer/Football includes many leagues with real team logos and real player names and portraits, no mods needed.This game allows you to select a team from your desired league and manage the players and the club to try to win games and cups.You start with the real life list of players and can sell/buy new players.The simulation seems fine, with tactical changes affecting the game.PROS AND CONS:Pros - FREE Football ManagerGood UIRuns smoothlyEasy to learnReal players and clubsReal icons with no need for modsGood simulationCons - You can inject cash and buy players with ""coins""Cash is hard to come by - You lose more than you make without spending real moneyGames are pre-determined. I tested this out by saving and then re-loading the game, the fixtures will always come out the same no matter what.It seems like fouls come too easy in this game, even on softer tackling. Once again, pre-determined games ruin the immersion.OVERALL -Good Soccer/Football manager for someone who can't spend any moneyIf you have the money to buy a football manager, it is 10x better than this game at the moment.I will give this game a positive rating since it works as intended and I believe for the person who doesn't want to spend money, this game will be satisfactory. TL;DR - Good game, good simulation. Pre-determined matches and coin buying ruins it for me, but may not be a problem for other people. Pick it up and try it out for yourself.			"

												THIS IS NOT Pro Evolution Soccer or FIFA, it's just a game that allows you to manage your squad and transfers and play matches without actually playing or interacting with the system, it does that for you like simulation mode on FIFA Career Mode. There are a hell of a lot of teams to choose from, almost every league that you could imagine. Gameplay is not really too fun mainly because the game very interactive when you start a match  besides subsitutions and changing player positions. In all, I would give this game a 6/10 and would reccomend it only because it is free. If it was $5 or $6 though, I wouldn't tell anybody to buy this game too much.			"

												This game is soccer manager 2017. This game is very simple but manages to keep things interesting as you can turn basically any team into a big team with things such as ground upgrades and stadium expansions. Its a concept that was pulled off very well, And in my opinion is the best current free football managing game just for its simplicity.			"

												Very good game in my opinion. Easy to play once you get the hang of it. I manage to play and sign players just fine without spending any money on SM credits. All you need to do is win matches and leagues and use that prize money to purchase whatever players or facility upgrade you require.The only problem i seem to have is that occasionally, seeing that i play this game on different devices including the steam version and the mobile app version, sometimes the saved game would be out of date and i would therefore have to replay the matches and regain the progress which wouldnt have been transferred to the other device. Signing out and signing in again sometimes helps fix this though.  Overall i think it is a very good game, fun to play. I highly recommend you at least give it a try, you might like it as many others do.			"
