												This game is good.This game is good!This game is good?Yep. Saviors, the 19 cent 2D shootemup, is good. I was not expecting this. No really, I was looking forward to tearing this game to pieces. Unfortunately for me, the only worthy complaint is the terrible character-models and bland art-direction. Once I actually played the game, it all came together quite nicely. This is a legitimately decent indie shooter.Humanity is doomed AGAIN, or maybe they're not doomed, or maybe I don't care. This threadbare and easily ignorable plot sets up 15 stages of shooting action. For an arcade 2D shooter, that's quite a lot. Thankfully, these stages are well-paced, with only 5 of them having real boss-fights. Furthermore, your first experience with this game is liable to be the story mode, where the large number of stages seems a bit more sensible.In story mode, you're given the choice of three pilots, each with their own ship. As you play through the stages, you'll gather experience, which leads to level-up perks. Also, in-between stages you can decide on primary, secondary, and side weapons. There's an interesting amount of strategy, that's tempered by good old-fashioned reflexes. The better you do, the higher your score, which also ties into your experience. The level of difficulty can also be changed, just in case things get too easy or too difficult. The other modes remove the stage to stage decision-making. Instead you're given a choice between various ships and weapon-systems. All you have to do is select the setup that suits your play-style.With Saviors, unlike most shooters, you always have an idea of what's approaching. There are constant indicators for every enemy ship, so you can focus on either destroying them immediately, or let them stay on-screen for a bit, so you can maintain your chain combo. Each ship has their own arsenal and pattern. As you progress you'll face newer ships in greater numbers. Another aspect that is unlike most shooters is the fact that you get a shield. Obviously it's not something to be relied upon, but it comes in handy for those stray shots. The boss-fights tend to be bullet-hell affairs. All you really have to do is hang back, fire away, and dodge for seemingly an eternity. For most players, the normal difficulty provides a sufficient challenge.Saviors has a good ""flow"" to it. There are new dangers or problems to deal with in every stage, but nothing too absurd that it changes the nature of the game. The mechanics are also fairly solid, none of the damage you'll take will feel cheap. Although, sometimes the game can get a little too busy with the explosions. On the bright side, this tends to happen during ""break"" mode, where enemies and their projectiles explode frequently. It's very satisfying, though sometimes tough to control.As far as other complaints go, I think bosses tend to take a little too long. Their last sliver of energy takes forever to drain away, even if I unload all of my limited secondary weapons on it. Each ship also has their own speed setting. While it's nice to have a faster ship for reaching enemies quickly; more often than not, I'd rather have slow-movement for those waves of bullets I need to dodge. Otherwise it's mostly nitpicks, like some perks not being very useful.Saviors is a very nice surprise. It has solid mechanics, a decent amount of variety, enough replay-value to last, and it will likely cost you a penny or two after selling the cards. It just might be worth your time.			"

About Star SaviorsInspired by Ikaruga, Raiden, and Radiant Silvergun, Saviors brings the best bullet hell experience you can find on Steam. Play through 18 challenging stages in this ultimate test of tactics and reflexes. The Graphics  	Buller hell games really don't need that much graphic power, with using simple meshes (like this game does) it works perfectly. But this just can't be overlooked, the character models are taken out of a nightmare, and just put in there to haunt you for the rest of your life. If you can just pass this simple detail, everything else is fine. The Music	Empowering, just the music it needs for the type of game it is. Mostly heard is metal, with a few dubstep sounds mixed within. If you love that kind of music, you are going to love this game.  The Story 	You as the reader, have probably heard this story over and over again, the story where you are the chosen one and you have to save the world. Now this may come as a suprise, but this game actually changes it (no it doesn't). You follow a relatively average campaign through the galaxy to prevent a war that is going to unfold at any moment. Also the game tells you multiple times that you are the chosen one, and that you are the only one who can do what you are doing. Although at the start of the campaing, you are given the choice between 3 characters, and while you are doing what you are doing, the other 2 characters are doing the same, but remember how you are the only one capable of doing this ? Well you are not. The Gameplay  Really fast paced, you don't have time to think about what you are going to do, as you are bombarded all the time. It does get progressively harder with every level, as it is expected. The bosses man were they hard, mostly that one at the 13'th level, but nothing a second (if only it were 2 tries) attempt couldn't fix. All in All  Star Saviors	 is a very nice Action Game!9/10 From MeSweep "

												Pros: This game is very enjoyable and will bring a couple hours of fun (It varies on the difficulty chosen)Cons: +No actual online Co-Op, only Local (EDIT : Since this review has been posted, it has been changed to local co-op, which makes me smile, ty devs :D) +Some of the visuals, especially the avatars, look awful and would've looked better in 2D+The game isn't actually that long, and not that much replayability Diagnosis - Get it on a sale (at .19c, it was a steal), but if you have the money it might be worth it if you're into bullet hell shooters.

												At first glance the game looks like something made in 1995 and upscaled to HD. The price is also suspiciously low. But don't let that fool you, because Star Staviors is a surprisingly decent and well made indie shmup, with a lot to offer.The game is clearly inspired by some of the more popular titles in the genre, in a good way. It is simple and easy to get into, yet offers numerous game modes, difficulties, ship types and weapons to choose from. From what I've played on normal it seems fair, and the controls are responsive enough. The challenge is there, the shooting is enjoyable, and numerous achievements and modes encourage multiple playthroughs.The game surely is not perfect and could have been improved in some areas, but as a whole it is really good. Simply put, I've had a lot of fun with with it. More so than with many other shmups, that are way more expensive and more hyped up. Great and catchy soundtrack also certainly adds a lot to the overall enjoyment.			"

Things I love in shmups.  Power-ups and Bosses.  Refreshingly, the power-ups you choose don't stay anchored to you.  You're free to mix it up before any level.  You earn new power-ups by performing better in the level via score and score multipliers. It's a pretty simple formula.  If you do well, fun++.I only went against a few bosses, but they all had their own patterns that required to be learned.  It's very easy to recommend Saviors if you like Shmups / Bullet-Hells.			"

												SAVIORS~~~~~~~ Saviors is a Space Shoot’Em up. Graphically the game is mediocre and to be honest should have look better in my opinion. Saying this, this game is extremely fun to play and offer several levels of difficulties from easy to insane and different modes of play.In the story line, you can change the primary, side and secondary weapons and upgrade you spaceship too at the end of each level.In terms of the soundtracks, it is ok.If you are looking for a fun space Shoot’Em up, this game is great fun.Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Fun to play-	Several modes -	Plenty of achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Average graphicsOverall, I enjoyed it. 7/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												Aside from the really creepy human faces, and the blerb's insistence that this is ""the best bullet hell experience you can find on Steam"", it's not terrible. But I don't get a feeling of... impact from it. The sound design doesn't support the visuals enough, so I'm left feeling like I'm playing a video game quite a long time ago, not like I'm having an experience. As part of a bundle or otherwise discounted, it's a fine bit of nostalgia, but if you're paying cash moneys for a new twist on the good ol' arcade shooter, I'd go with Crimzon Clover World Ignition or Titan Attacks, personally.

												I have never been much of shmup player.  Always tended to be more toward strategy game and platformers, but did complete some games form this genre. At first, was not sure what to expect from the game I got for 19 cents, and to be honest, I was surprised how good and solid game this is. From simple play you expect shmup game to be too nice weapons upgrade and perks upgrade that give game interesting twist. So far levels seems to be quite well made, and game is well playable and I did not even scratch surface of other options such as time attacks etc. Did I mention there is story behind as well, but as very patient person I always skip it… If you don’t have it, definitely worth getting.

												95% of the games one gets a coupon of are worthless in terms of playability or story. This story however has a good concept (alien trading gone wrong), it slightly lacks a bit of realism or sane conversations but that doesn't matter too much since the main idea of the game isn't exactly the story.There, I said all that is wrong with this game but for one thing I'll put in the end.The game has an amazing soundtrack and is very immersive. Graphics in-game are very well made (I won't start about how your protagonist(s) looks like...might say alien comes close) and the game is very clear in what you have to do so that even a person new to a bullet hell game knows exactly what he should do.I haven't tried the coop yet, but the possibility is very welcome since most Bullet Hells are singleplay only. Defending humanity alongside your friends.So...what's wrong, you ask. The price. 99 cents. It's worth much more. I got it for 25ct myself thanks to a coupon - wouldn't have known the game otherwise.			"

												I've bought this game just to test my new credit card on Steam, but...This game is perfect in absolutely everything it does.It isn't a bullet hell wannabe-tryhard, its controls and SPEED are unbelievably GOOD and ACCURATE. It's undescribably good and satisfactory to play this game with a DualShock 3, for example.It doesn't feel like a 2 penny game AT ALL. Crap, I even feel bad because of its price. It should cost more, because the experience it deliver is worth WAY MORE than just 2 dollars.Graphics isn't NEXT-GEN CRYSIS 4K 120Hz MEGA-ULTRA, but hey, that's a 2 penny game. IMHO, they're very good. I mean, really. It reminds me of late PS2 games/early PS3 games (more of the latter).But undoubtly the best thing about this game is the soundtrack. OH MY GOD, THE SOUNDTRACK.I've caught myself smiling like a fool everytime a new level started because of the TOO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOOD SOUNDTRACK. THINK ABOUT SOMEONE IMPRESSED. I mean, REALLY. IT'S SO GOOD AND IF YOU LIKE VIDEOGAME MUSIC, OH MY GOD, BUY THIS GAME.If you're bored and you want some explosive action, intense soundtrack with 1 million colored laser bullets on the screen at the same time, hell, you CAN'T GO WRONG. BUY THIS GAME. It's impossible not to have fun while playing this.EDIT: Just nominated this game to the “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award. It deserves way more recognition.			"

												Bought this at a good discount, just for the cards to be honest.Started playing, just to see what type of game it was and ... finished it in one go. Now, my game library is filled with ""hey, this is a pretty good game, let's put it aside for later"" stuff, which I tend not to ever start up again. So saying that I finished a game in one setting is pretty exceptional in itself.Basically it is a fairly standard shoot 'm up with bullet-hell bosses. Normally I despise bullet-hells, but here it was not so bad at all. Consider it a bullet-hell-light if you want.You get the typical top-down view most of the time, with occasionally switched camera perspectives. We've seen it all countless times in these sort of games but it continues to impress.Grapically the game is underwhelming. The ""3D"" avatars that brief you in between missions are of a quality you would expect from games of 1996, the ships lack animation and the UI is fairly boring. Still, the ship design is pretty good from a Sci-Fi point of view and, while boring and uninspired, the UI offers exactly what you want from it, without distracting. The 3D backgrounds are nice as well although don't expect Crysis-levels of backdrops for this price.Speaking about the briefings, the story is forgettable as well. The Earth is once again in danger yadda yadda yadda. But who cares about a story in this type of game anyway?The sound is meh. The fighting sounds OK but not more than that. The soundtrack is pretty good, FAR better than you would would expect from such a cheap game. Too bad there are only 3 or so tracks.The gameplay on the other hand is outstanding. Shooting just feels great. There is also plenty of choice in weaponry and it is a joy to combine the different weapon types to build your own little ship of doom (trademark pending). The levels are also short and vary in background, so you really are driven to see what comes next. The ""one more turn"" is strong with this one!The developers included a very sweet ""break"" scoring mechanic, that awards a high score multiplier with mass-explosions, replacing the screen-wiping bomb you usually get in SHMUPS with chain-reactions of fire and death. This is an excellent choice and seeing screen after screen of enemies explode is soooo rewarding, you will want to drive up your multiplier even if you don't care about highscores at all.There is also a level-up system, awarding good scores even more. The unlockable perks are not extra-ordinary, but do allow you to customise your ship to your liking. There are five attributes to build up and I went full defence for example, while other peeps will want to go full offence. Similarly, you can choose from between 3 different ships at the start.You can finish the game in about 90 minutes, which was just good enough. Any longer might have been too repetitive.Summarizing: this is a hidden gem for such a low price. Whether you are new to shoot-em-ups or like the genre, you can't really do bad with this purchase.Score:Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 5/10Sound: 6/10Difficulty: 6/10Value-for-money: 9/10			"

												Saviors is a neatly designed shoot'em up game in the style of ""bullet hell"" and fun at times.Pros:+ Cheap. If you get a foil carddrop, the game even pays for itself.+ Level design. (Especially later stages). Delivers fun reflex moments.+ Gfx palette: You can clearly spot enemy bullets, projectiles and enemies theirselves during the carnage. All blends well and easy on the eye.Neutral:+ Soundtrack: Music is cool and blends with the action but its not enough for the genre. (See and listen to music of Amiga era classic shooters like ""Disposable Heroes,"" ""Agony,"" etc.+ Gfx: Color palette and everything is very vell designed. Enemy ships and backgrounds need more polishing and looks just too simple for this age. Character gfx between levels are poor.Cons:+ Needs more gfx polishing for better product value. Because the basics are all set (nice lvl design, above average soundtrack etc.)7/10 - it was fun			"

Music is also exactly what you'd expect for this sort of game.There's plenty of modes, online highscore tables (with replays) - controls can be rebound/changed (keyboard or pad) I've gotten a load of fun out of it - I reckon you might too, just ignore those 'talking head' bits eh? :)			"

												The gameplay and music are excellent and could easily be a top SHMUP were it not for one fatal flaw: it sucks to be player two.  My wife and I like to play SHMUPs together, and for reasons we just don't understand, the option to have both players have ""first-player"" functionality is not something the developer has allowed.  The second player is gimped.  It doesn't seem like a hard thing to add to just allow the players to choose if they want to use the default behaviour of having the second player use an alternate style or both players use the normal/first-player style.Since most people rate this well, and since this is a game we really only wanted to play together, I'm going to choose to not recommend this to other people interested in buying a game to play coop with friends or family.  I really do hope they address this in the future.			"

												Very cool and engaging game. It really took me back to those days when I used to play Chicken Invaders, Space Invaders. etc. The effects are A1 as well, especially when weapons are used simultaneously when destroying the enemies. It can be a challenging game, considering the swarm of enemies that come your way and if you're not a fast thinker, but it's not enough to make a person rage quit or complain. I read a few comments where people complained a bit about the effects being too much on the eyes; I can agree with that, but it's not too bad, unless you're one of those people who has to sit at point blank range in front of the screen. Also, the story really isn't that great. I actually just skip through it and get to the action. I feel like it should just be one of those games that just has a bunch of different levels to run through, with a variety of enemies and weapons. Again, it's a cool game and I'm most definitely gonna play more.

												short:I recommend it for all ppl who like shootem'ups in general, but consider that it doesn't feel like a true arcade or classic game, which is the reason why I don't recommend it.Saviors tries to bring the bullethell genre on a next level and misses the point. The gameplay is not comparable to normal shmups. That's ment in a bad way. The gameplay just feels plain. . The design  hits the standards , but is more generic than outstanding. The appearance of the on the topscreen are making the game in some cases more confusing than fitting.  The soundtrack isn't unique as well. There is one  soundtrack to go for, the one in the trailer. The others are just like ""not there!""...they sound monoton. It's a playable little shooter for a short time. You are free to change your loadout in terms of weapons every level. Which is nice. But you don't get an arcad-ish feeling, when playing. That's propably the reason why I dislike this game. The game can be very challenging in the harder difficulties which is awesome. however, the graphics are kind of a downer in that part. The changed breakmode is also less interesting to me, as it feels not like if you are killing things faster that way.			"

Seriously I got killed by a nearby building... +Its damn CHEAP. OuO)bCons :-Character's faces are a bit... Lifeless.Well I can't find any other cons honestly except for... That. This game is just so well-crafted!Do I recommend it?Of f**king course!This is just a review from a personal perspective. :3 Whatever is in the pros and cons are up to debate.			"

												This is a very solid shooter experience, and it was made by just three people.  This is exactly the sort of gem you hope to find from small indie teams.The graphics and music are above average, the control is tight, there are a lot of options to customize your experience, and several different game modes to keep you going.There are 18 levels to complete to make it through the story.  After each mission you are allowed to pick perks, as well as customize your main, secondary and special weapon.  As you get deeper in the game more options unlock.  You can also choose one of three pilots, and each ship has its own unique flavor.  Missions are a mix of standard enemies and bosses.  Most moves are telegraphed ahead of time, giving you a split second to plan your next move.  You can also alternate your fire between going all guns forward for full damage, or split your damage three ways and shoot ahead of you and to each side.The story sections are the weakest portion of the game.  There is nothing unique, the writing is not very natural, and the pilots don't look great in the speaking sections.  There is an alien invasion, and only your commander saw it coming, now go blow everything up.  The end.  Fortunately, all story sections can be skipped.Very worthwhile game if you enjoy this type of shooter.  A solid entry, give it a try.9/10			"

												Amazing game! Pros: Great backgrounds, soundtrack, and gameplay. If you enjoy bullet hell games, this is the  game for you.Cons: Human faces that appear in the game are insanely hideous. Also weapons only have verbal and visual descriptions with no statistical numbers or bars to show which weapons are more powerful than others. Also not a fan of the fact that once you play one mode, you have to  delete your save data in that mode to switch to another (for example if you start story mode, you have to delete all progress to try another mode)Overall a fun game to kill time.

												I feel compelled to tell people about this game.  It cost me $1..... ONE DOLLAR.   I love bullet hell games, I've always loved them, they hold a special place in my heart so please remember that when reading this review.+The difficulties go from easy to insane and those words are very literal.+This game took me an hour to beat, I then played it twice more in succession because I enjoyed it so much.+Chooe your weapons before the level.  I love that.+Music is straight out of a DaRude album and it is apropos+Graphics are what you should expect for $1-Short game but again....... $1I don't see any reason not to get this even if you aren't a bullet hell fan.  If you ever wanted to try one out just to see what they're like, here's your opportunity.put it up there with DoDonPachi and Ikaruga, it's fun, it's challenging, its bullet hell. "

												It's a great value for the price. Saviors delivers a satisfying shoot em up experience. It's definitely challenging, playing it on normal was kicking my butt. I was never able to handle the higher difficulties. If you're looking for a bullet hell type experience you'll definitely find one here. The game play is solid. The main feature of the game is comboing your kills to the point where you cause massive chain explosions of all ships on the screen. It's quite a satisfying mechanic. Watching wave upon wave of enemy ships melt while you're under a break chain was very fulfilling. The game shows the sillouette of every approaching enemy so you can plan where to move your ship before enemies appear. It's a nice feature that definitely makes up for how hard it gets. There's 18 levels in the game, with multiple game modes, but it does get repetitive after you've played through a couple times. The game is cheap though, and the value you get out of it is well worth it. The music for the game is fantastic, I particularly liked the boss fight music. The NPC character heads are hideous and worth the price alone just to experience.			"

												Personal Tip: Controller is highly recommended. With a mouse/keyboard one of the directional arrows do not seem to work simultaneously with the fire button, although that may just be on a few people's ends.For a few cents (depending on your local currency) while it is still on sale, this game is an absolute steal for some short, quality bullet hell entertainment. Soundtrack is on point and the graphics aren't pretentious. Its strength lies in the frantic gameplay. P.S. You might be a little weirded out by the human facial animations but to me that simply adds to the non-pretentious charm of this title!			"

												There are lots of people who drop this to ""idle for cards"" bin, but it deserves a fast glance at least. What's different between this and your average idling game is that this is actually the only game on Steam by this developer and it was polished by years. There were at least 5 major updates, including remastered soundtrack, so you can see they actually worked hard on it.The game itself is a mix of everything nice in vertical shmups - perks, weapons, tons of enemies, bullets, beams, bosses... Well, you know, like any other shmup. Its weak spot is the design as it looks like it's straight from 1999, but you know, this might be the reason some people like it. Soundtrack is definitely inspired by the older japanese shmups and again, you don't really know is it they couldn't get better quality or they actually tried to mimick the older sound. As of the storyline I cannot really tell you what happens there, but you probably won't bother too. Shmups are not about story.			"

												Another nice shooter with a very low price (frankly, I'm ready to pat a little bit more for such a game, although not MUCH more). It has some elements of bullet-hell, which I dislike, but mostly it's OK (only the final boss is really hard). A selection of weapons is limited, but welcome, and this game has shield, not just one-hit-and-you-re-dead policy, which is a good reason to like it. Still not a replacement for Raptor, of course, not even close :)			"

												This was one I got because of trading cards for pennys a long time back, after that I didn't really play much.  Playing it again more recently though, I can say that if you are a fan of shmups, more specifically of Tyrian, this might appeal to you.  Depending on the mode you play, you will have choices of ships.  There are 9 variants in arcade and survival that you play through the whole game with whichever you choose, while story lets you choose one of three base ships that can be customized with perks and three weapons of your picking.This game is actually quite difficult, past easy and also normal after a few tries, it really kicks your ♥♥♥.  EDIT: There is actually a practice mode under new game, if you're going to play hard or insane you better practice the stages because the game is long and very difficult past normal.The soundtrack is probably the highlight of this game, it is actually quite good and I will remember the boss theme for some time to come.I see this game on sale often, if you play shmups and want something a little different than a traditional shmup these days, this might help to kill some time and at 2 dimes you're not losing anything trying it out.  For full price, I would tread carefully unless you like the customization idea via Tyrian or older PC shmups or if you are already a shmup veteran.  For shmup noobies, you may want to stick to easy/normal for this game.  On hard/insane, this game is HARD.			"

												I used to love games like R-Type back in the arcade heyday. After trying and getting bored with a few modern bullet hell shooters on Steam I had almost given up on the genre until I found this game.This game is so much fun. It captures everything that is fun about shooters and can be as challenging as you are willing to subject yourself to. It had me playing levels over and over because I knew I could beat them. Some levels on hard settings seem impossible, but you know they are not so you play them again and again until you finally beat them.Definitely worth the price of admission.			"

												For a retro space shooter bullet hell, it's pretty damn good. Shots are easily visible, aswell as whether you're in side or front shot mode. I also like that your hitbox isn't directly your ship, it's the center circle, so it's really easy to see the bright blue shots coming towards you, and the green/orange hitbox. It's refined space shooters down to it's finest form, everything about it done right. EXCEPT FOR THE CODEC FACES WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!?!??!??!			"

												Note: I idled for cards for ~13 hours (rip) so my actual playtime as of posting this review is almost 9 hours.Pros :- Great soundtrack.- Different modes with a good amount of levels.- Can be played for many hours so it's not one of those short 99 cent games.- Has plenty of achievements.- Has trading cards.- It's really cheap.- Full controller support (not that I have a working one) and leaderboards too.Cons :- There's an issue(?) with some of the achievements. Read this thread for more info - link.Neutral :- The game has 4 difficulties : easy, normal, hard, insane. Easy is ez pz. On the other hand normal was quite hard for me. It even says in the info ""The intended way to play which is rather difficult"". So I can't imagine what will it be like on the other 2 difficulties. For me this is a drawback but if you're a masochist hardcore player that likes challenges it's probably a benefit.Conclusion :I bought Star Saviors for 20-ish cents, I think, which is a steal.

												In-game interface is not very integrated, I find myselft rarely looking at it. Just some numbers on the top of the screen would have worked.Difficulty is mostly based on overflowing the screen with enemies, instead of some few intelligent patterns of well disposed ones. They midly fix this with a images that warn you of what enemies and where they are going to appear, which is a thing I don't like very much. This is really a fix to mantain an error inside the game: too many enemies? Put few of them, make them harder, make them follow different movement patterns.There are moments in this game where you simply die because you don't know what is going to happen, so you have to play the level, die from a surprise, and prevent it the next time. Blowing up half your life or shield does not seem very fair to me.Also, the game expects you to lose some your shield and or life to certain barrages of bullets, instead of incentivating it's elusion. It would be more interesting if there was always a way to elude them, even if it was difficult.There are different weapons loadouts you can select, but some of them seem very similar to me. Also, I think the game expects you to grind a little. Grinding usually means not enought balance was put in the game.Music is good. Story is so-so. But, oh, the creepy faces from the briefings, they make me feel awkward. They are 3D animated faces which have an amateur feeling about them, they pretend to be serious faces but the result is exactly the opposite one. The son of the old man seems like an extremely abnormal person.			"

There is even a 2-player coop game mode for those who prefer to play with friends!As for the negatives, the graphics for the pilots are quite unexpressive.

												Savior. a simple and a great game. first time you play this and wonder ""what have I gotten myself into"", than you die. But for some reason, you keep on going (or flying). It's a challengeing game. This game activates all your senses, it is difficult, but not that difficult for you to shut down the game. A space shooter game, graphic not so advanced, but it's old, so it is ok. But the gamplay is great, the people in this game looks so weird and funny, that you forget what they talk about. Want to have fun and maybe make som progress in the game, play on 2 players mode. as the time goes by, you beat the game and the satsifaction from seeing the credit.			"

												I just did my first play through of this game and I enjjoyed every minute of it. Granted you have to not pay much attention to the graphics... especially the characters as you are being briefed. That jaw line... just wow... BUT! I did play through on easy and just when I thought the game was to easy I died... Then after a little embarrasment I tried again.. and died.. So after multiple attempts I beat the game on easy. I don't see myself playing this game a lot, but it's one that I'm glad to have in my library to go back to every once in a while and play. I did enjoy the soundtrack and I will say besides the graphics the only upset that I had about the game was it was a one and done play through. 18 levels of non stop shooting and maybe an arcade play here and there. I would recommend a little more content :(5/10 graphics8/10 soundtrack			"

												This game is a must buy for anyone who enjoys Shoot'em Ups. It has everything you want from one of these. Multiple difficulties, a decent amount of levels, a good amount of variation in guns and some very fun boss fights. The music to the game is also very good. I may have bought the game for only 20 cents (Or something simmilar), however I would have been willing to pay $10-$20 for it. The only real negative it has was that the text took a while to scroll and go onto the next set of text, leading me to stop reading the text towards the end of the game. From what I did read however, the story line seemed quite generic, but I never expected much of one from this style of game. Overall, I can not express enough how much I would recommend this game.

												Well, I admit... I bought this game cause it was 19 cents, and I figured I could get some cards and sell them and basically have a free game. Didn't really expect much since there are many Bullet Hells on Steam and most are of questionable quality. Aside from that, I don't really like the genre much. So... what could possible change any of that, right?Well... this game could. Although it's campaign has a flinter-thin plot, filled with Engrish and cringe-worthy dialogue it's rather fun to go through. The game looks good, plays good,  and yes, it sounds great (that's some great OST there). It gives precognition of enemies to come so you can always prepare (even though sometimes that can really clutter the screen and can be confusing between what's there and what to come) and thus lacks any unfair ""surprise"" others of the genre so love. Any opposition is actually fair to fight. In the campaign it also allows some minor choices of what you want to improve in (offensive, defensive, missiles etc.) which works well. I went full on damage and shields myself.Conclusion; If this game can appease someone not liking the genre, it's definitely a must-get for all who do. And if you're like me, go ahead, give it a try. You may be positively surprised. And if not, well, you lost 5 cents... That's got to be one of the best gambles you'll ever get ;)			"

												What to say about this game?If you blink, you are dead.Bought it after sell some cards (96% off), guessing that this game wasn't gonna be the big thing, but f*ck! I was totally wrong.This is a hell of a game, with simple but effective graphics and great gameplay, like Zero Wing or similars. You can't expect a so-deep-I-can-see-Adelle-rolling plot, but it's good enough for the context.Despite the prejudgements, the story mode didn't let me sleep the entire night, but I cut it off when died like fifty times against the same boss; really frustating. But when I woke up I beated the sh*t out of him.This game has the difficulty that many lacks, it's a challenge.Now, let's begin with the pros and cons (though I haven't beated the final boss yet):PROs: Wide weapon options. Three ships, with different characteristics. Cool explosions. Dynamic levels. Zero Wing nostalgia. Arcade and survival modes. Kick-♥♥♥ OST, it's really great. I bought it as DLC. I'm in the scoreboard list!! This isn't a ""piece of cake"" game. It may be short, but really defiant. Despite the difficulty, it's fair (Easy, Normal, Hard and Insane). Gives you the feel of ""YEAH I DID IT I WENT THROUGH THIS SH*T!!!!"" when you beat a boss.CONs: Characters' faces aren't the best. Ken's not just an arrogant Vegeta-like guy, he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, seriously. What the hell is wrong with him? Little problems to get into the scenario at early levels, but later it figures out. Annoying bug against the laser's boss, when you stomp against the... Floor?To finish: Buy this game if you spare a few bucks, you won't regret it, specially if you like this kind of arcade and starships games. But, again: it's a challenge.			"

												Okay, is this game Saviors or Star Saviors? It's called Star Saviors on the main page, but the actual picture's title and the title on my download list says ""Saviors"". Well, which is it, Steam?Before I go completely off track, I was mildly surprised by Star Saviors. I know the Bullet Hell audience (a couple of my friends are part of that niche), and let me just say that they can be about as damned annoying as anime/manga fans.  Especially when a new Bullet Hell game comes out! Well, I decided to try this one out just for craps and giggles, and was a little more surprised with what I got than what I was expecting. This game isn't a masterpiece, but I had a lot of fun- while I was expecting a more dull game. Star Saviors functions like the classic ""your ship moving constantly forward, with all the other ships trying to blow you up"", fashion. You fly, and you shoot. But what Saviors has that made me love it a lot more than the old 1940's plane games I used to tear up back in the day, is that those amazing weapon upgrades that'd normally disappear in one hit in those arcade games are full-on upgrades you can unlock and combine with your weapons in whatever style you want, to maximize damage. No specific pattern of bullets is better than the other, since they all upgrade in damage at the same time, and that I really, really liked. Even the upgradeable perks system was a nice touch.Now, there IS a huge difficulty curve in this game you have to get over, and it can be a bit annoying at times, when you've got a sliver of health left on a boss and you die and have to start all the way back at the beginning, but it still manages to be fun with all the adversity I faced- and I even found it addicting.The story's short (as the main game's campaign is roughly 2 hours), but it's a little bit better than other indie arcade-reminiscent games I've played in a while. Mind you, I'm not saying this is Oscar-material. The enemies have no personality, and the guy and girl that follow you do no service to the plot (and honestly, no one on your Saviors team actually helps you shoot down enemies, which is weird at the end on one of your teammates says, ""I shot the most of them!""... BS! I shot ALL of them!""). And the character's faces look like a clay face forced back into an uncomfortable stare that are being telepathically controlled through their lips... It's honestly creepy to look at. But as far as characterization goes with the father and son, gave a small but nice touch. The other plot points were nonsensical and did nothing at all for me, but the moments when your dad encourages you and wants to make sure you stay safe were a slight touch of ""something more"" that this game has.Again, it's not perfect. The plot is really pointless, as you aimlessly fly from zone A to be, gunning down enemies, finishing a boss fight, and doing... something to forward your progress on saving your home planet. But it's still a fun game to throw 20 cents on. It's certainly worth that.			"

												Awesome little title. Based on old arcade 'space-shooters' on a modern graphics engine. The game is an absolute 'Bomb' packed full of action. You will need a decent hand eye coordination getting through the levels and a strategic and thoughful way of weapons upgrades. As you will find that different weapons have more or less effective effect on the 'boses'. The graphics is real sharp and colourful. A greatly enjoyable game!			"

If I had to describe it - I'd say it was a top-down bullet hell that is one part ""Life Force"" (NES) and one part sci-fi rpg (perk system & weapons customization).It's quite fun.  It gives me a bit of the nostalgia feels.  If you're looking for great graphics - this isn't for you.

												Expecting your run of the mill space shooter, I found to my surprise a really solid game. The controls are tight, the enemies are imaginative and keep you on your toes, and the challenge is more than decent.The music can be really good in some levels, specially when action ramps up, but other than that is average and has a lounge-like feeling.The story didn't really drew me in and I think it's because of the ugly character models. This game could have used some 2d illustrations and shorter intros.But besides all that, the core gameplay is really good, the perk system is well implemented and the game holds up to the high standards of the genre.

												I just turned this on for the first time and beat it in a sitting. Will I ever play it again? No. But was it worth the $0.50 sale price? Sure.I really, really, REALLY hate to say this, but the worst part about this game is the graphics. Try and look at the pilots without grimacing. Try it. Bet you can't. The core game looks well enough, albeit very simple and bland.So how about the game itself? It starts pretty simple: shoot some bullets, dodge some bullets. The difficulty slowly ramps through a surprisingly long arcade mode. I'm a bit of a vet and the last few stages had me going. So there's that.Soooo...is this game worth buying? If you really like top down shooters, go for it. Taoplan, Cave, and Treasure it is not. But for $0.50? Meh. It was enteraining enough. I still skipped right through the story because those faces were god awful to look at, though.			"

												Buy this game for the soundtrack!Graphics: 75%Audio: 100%Gameplay: 80%Replayability: 70%Value for money: 80%Total: 81%The first few minutes when booting up the game, entering your name and playing the tutorial is a bit meh. But, boy, was that to change! The music and the way the game moves, really makes this game. It's a pity the rest of the graphics is a bit lacking: The enemies are a bit dull. Yes, they are huge, but very little details and variations. And the backdrop could also have been a little bit more interesting. But the graphic mechanics, if I can call it that, is very good. You feel you drive your plane in all directions while playing this bullet hell of a game.Did I mention the music? It's been a long while since I've heard this level of energic music, which actually fits the game. It's really the best you can get from a game music.As for gameplay, it's pretty standard. Easy mode should be avoided, unless your try to play through the ""campaign"". The fun starts at Hard. You also have different modes. The campaign let's you modify your plane for each level, and level up perks, while the other modes is fairly standard: Choose a loadout and see how far you can go with what you've got.So will this game be played more in the future? For sure! It's a game that I will pull out when I feel I just need to shoot something. Or perhaps challenge a friend. It hasn't got too much diversity in levels, so it isn't a game I will play for hours and hours.Finally, is it worth my money and time? Fer sure! It could have been sold for even more than the current price, and still be worth a purchase. It's not the most unique shoot'em up, but it deserves to be in the collection of any fan of the genre.I really wish they make a sequel with the same quality of music and even better graphics. Then it will be a real hit!			"

												if u are able to play this game and the game not crashed it is not too bad at allPros :-There are tons of achievements-Variable weapons-Some extra skills (perks) available-Has trading cards-Good graphics for gameplayCons :-Weird character's face-So much bullet hell(even laser hell)-Too much achievement for me (I would never able to reach 100% clear achievement)-Ultra thin shield (hit twice by projectile and shield down[so weak~])-Story not interesting for me (so I skip it)overall 7/10Worth it for 0.19$			"

												The game is great considering it's so cheap, it's not a technical marvel (quite ugly at times to be honest) but it plays well. The highlight for me however, is the soundtrack, it is worth the asking price just because of it, no doubt.			"

												Star Saviors. Самолетная космо-пострелушка. Уже точно и не сосчитать точное количество продуктов подобного рода.Получив скидку в 96% Star Saviors привлекла внимание некоторых людей. Многие, конечно, взяли ее для карточек. Однако, лично для меня нашелся один замечательный элемент. - это саундтрек. Он великолепен (нужно обязательно постараться и вытащить его оттуда). А в отсальном - все по стандартам.Сюжет - все как обычно. Прищельцы, безащитность человечества, единственная надежда на нескольких избранных, защита родной матушки-земли, путь до планеты прищельцев и соттветственно ее выжигание... вот и все...Графон - ничего особенного... хотя... взрывы выглядят как-то неестественно...Геймплей - абсолютная классика. Неплохой выбор режимов. Разнообразие вооружения. Некоторая хардкорность...  и все такоеМузыка и звуки - как сказано ранее, местный музон оставил приятные впечатления, хочется слушать снова и снова. Отдельное спасибо выражаю композитору Саули Корхонену за труды.Графика - 7/10Сюжет - 5/10Геймплей - 7/10Звуки и Музыка - 10/10Итоговая оценка моя 7/10По сравнению с множеством продуктов ""для карточек и ачивок"" - этот может затянуть на некоторое время.Вот мое словоЯ пошел вытаскивать саундтрек))---Star Saviors. An arcade cosmic-shootout. I can't say for sure, how many similar products already exist. Having a discount in 96%, Star Saviors attracted the attention of some people. Many of them, of course, bought it only for cards. However, there is something which attracted me as well. - It's soundtrack. But rest of things - business as usual...The plot - absolutely standard. Again aliens, danger upon mankind, the heroes, the protection of our native planet, the resistance, path to alien's homeland and destroying the threat... that's all plot...Graphics - nothing special ...wait ...i think the explosions doesn't look so cool...Gameplay - an good-old classic. A good selection of modes. A variety of weapons. Hardcore(When i started the boss fight on the highest difficulty... it reminded me about legendary hardcore called Contra...)Music and sound - It's greatest thing in this game. Music has left a good feeling in me, keeps me amused. Special thanks to Sauli Korhonen for his oustanding job with music.Graphics - 7/10Story - 5/10Gameplay - 7/10Music and sound - 10/10The final grade is - 7/10Compared with a lot of products ""for cards and achivements"" - this one looks good.That's my wordI going to extract soundtrack)) If somebody want it, tell me. I will see what i can do.			"

												I have a gazillion games and I hardly ever review any of them... how odd.  Well I will start up with this one.I almost feel bad for this developer since I paid all of I think .50 with my badge coupon. While I enjoy not spending a lot of money on entertainment, I almost think I should torrent it or something rather than give someone what amounts to I think .15 for a copy of their hard work.  Love Steam but dannngggggg....  I speak regular language; certainly not going to try to pass myself off as some pro game reviewer with IGN-style review-ery language, so...If you enjoy games like Ikaruga, or any number of other top down shooters then there is no reason to think you will not enjoy this game.  Action is fast, there are some light upgrading elements and different weapon configs that you unlock and when you combine that with 3 different ship bases (slow, average, fast, with the comparable weapon differences for those ""classes"") you get a good bit of variety in what you can play and how you can do it over the course of the game, although you are pressed into using some of the later unlocked weapons regardless of your preferrences due to increases in power as you go.  Although the later weapons are certainly more fun to use and look at so not sure if you would even want to stick with the initial weapons you have access too.The idea of only getting ""hit"" when you are struck in the dead center of your ship is nice, and I think I've only seen this in one other shooter I've played so it's rather unique.  The music is nice and up beat and suitably odd/unique and fits well with the gameplay.Graphics are very good but nothing that's going to rock your socks, nor should you expect that from <$2.00Good mash up of enemies and a nice rhythm with some cool boss fights with your typcial ""learn the firing patterns"" gameplay.There is a story.  It's a story lol.Good game a nice brisk change from some of your more ""involved"" games.  A nice overall arcade shooter.7/10 will fly and read text again.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Bullet hell Space shooting game.Interface/Menu/SettingsMain menu music is good.You are able to play this in Fullscreen or windowed mode.It has many resolution sizes.You can change your FPS Cap.There is a Master/Sound and Music volume slidebar. It Shows with % based.You can see your own statistics.You are able to play this game with a xbox controller.You are able to play LOCAL CO-OP.It has a story Mode, Arcade mode,  Survival mode, Practice Mode and Tutorial mode. Explained Tutorial.About the game.You are a Spaceship and your job is to kill enemies. Your hitbox is in the middle of the ship. Killing enemies will give you a multiplier. A high multiplier will kill other enemies more easier because the ship explosion will be bigger too. Your score will also increase but nobody cares about highscore anyway. However it does require to level up your ship level. You are able to choose between 3 Pilots with each of their own effects. The background surrounding moves and has some effect into the game aswell.Graphics isn't that super amazing, but doable.Able to skip Text Dialogue's.You are able to choose 3 Pilots with their own style and effects.Background graphics are very well done i have to say. It's something simple but you do have the feeling you are flying over a building and background is changing/moving and rotating aswell. Not only that, if there is a Building in your way you will take damage from this aswell.You have a Level up system.You can change the weapons on the ship.Level Music's are pretty good and has variety.You can't switch ships in between levels. Unless you want to start on level 1 again.Slow Pilot: Shots are more wide and spread out.Medium Pilot: Shorts are at the average speed and medium spread out.Fast Pilot: Shots are fast but the damage is low. Doesn't have Spread shots.Other things.I am not really a plane or pilot fan, but i have actually enjoyed the game. I think mainly to the music. Secondly the background.R.I.P EyesDon't start With score attack yet until you completed the game or don't give a Fox anymore. It will remove your Save state in STORY MODE and that means you have to start on level 1 again.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Visually mediocre and bland as usual in these amateur shooters, but the shooting part is fun. It's not a great challenge if you are really looking for that and the levels are not that varied or deliciously structured but it tries to use new stuff from time to time and has some different modes, and the shooting part is fun. So you have a regular cheap shooter, which its shooting part is fun. Nothing much to say. Oh, the soundtrack is really good, there is just a small bunch of songs but they're vibrant....and fit nicely with the shooting part, which is fun by the way.6.5/10			"

												This game is a perfect trigger for epileptic seizures in disguise because you'll get no warning about it. However, as for those being undiagnosed will probably start foaming anyway for how the visual/audio effects interact with your cerebral cortex.- 3D models are bearable, but 2D projectiles will give you the feeling you are bombarded with social media icons.- SFX were probably recorded in a toolshed somewhere in Finland with a mic'd up air hockey table that had some wine glasses on it. So, whenever you hit level up in-game, you'll hear someone proposing a toast. A toast for your remaining brain cells it shall be!-Oddly, characters looked like albino people. Don't know if they were intentionally.Just my 2 cents, I suggest you go with anything healthier, like Raptor - Call of the Shadows.			"

It was the awesome experience for me. Many gameplay configurations, so good replayability.And I love the soundtrack... <3I expected a plain clone of old-good ""The 4th Generation"", but I got more than expected and in 3D...I had no technical problems - the game works out-of-the-box. The price is more than reasonable.You proposed another game in your negative reviews, but I enjoyed this one more.Faces look strange, but hey... all you need is to read the text or skip it with a button. It is a 90s style modern space shooter with nice price...I like the replay function. When you see someone with hell-high score on top 10 table, you can download his replay and watch how he did that score (you can easily detect cheaters that way :D ).I love the zero-policy on cheating!!!And the game has a native support for 160FPS.It has trading cards, so you may trade them, but I bought it for the gameplay. Anyway, I crafted the badge and got a nice background. I will craft more... The galaxy background is magnificent...Game is compatible with the Steam overlay.EDIT: I got the main game on sale for approx. a quarter.

												The game description invokes some big names, but let's establish one thing right away: This is not a game that follows in the footsteps of games like Ikaruga or Radiant Silvergun; the production values on display and certain design decisions keep Star Saviors from that epic tier level of shmups. Fortunately, Star Saviors has a lot of things going for it that make it absolutely worth playing, particularly if you're new or not so skilled at shmup/bullet hell games.A major talking point is the price. It's very low for a game with as much content and competence on display here, and in a way I almost feel like the price sends a message that the game is crappier than it is. However, there's a very noticable low-poly almost amateur level to the character models and story presentation, but in a shmup game this isn't of importance and it's bizarre how much the story is pushed by the developers considering their study of the ""shmup greats"".But enough of all that, you say, how does it play? For a one dollar game, pretty damn well. I jacked it up to 1440p and blazed ahead at 120 fps, with smooth movement and easy dodging using a Dualshock 4. Games like Ikaruga have a certain elegance to the way the enemies approach and attack you, and in many ways a perfect run of a shmup like that is a beautifully coreographed dance between the player and the AI. In Star Saviors' case many enemies just come at you without an identifiable pattern, but it's clear a lot of throught and time was put into making sure that it felt good to shoot the enemies and to have bullet patterns that are always dodgable.As a veteran of this genre, I thought the game was quite easy at first. The ships have a shield that can take a hit before you start losing ""hull damage"", meaning that you can fail to dodge quite a bit before losing a life. If you are a veteran, however, Star Saviors has multiple difficulty modes and customizations to tailor the experience to you. To be clear: You can approach this game at any skill level with the genre and have a good time, with veterans missing some more advanced systems and newbies able to ease themselves into the genre using this game without being overwhelmed at the start.Ikaruga has a brilliant chaining system with the color changing, Radiant Silvergun had a massive variety of attacks on one ship as well as chaining based on the colors of the enemies. Sine Mora has a beautiful presentation of it's story and art design. Star Saviors does not meet any of the lofty levels of these greats, but the price is an unaviodable factor that makes it much easier to accept the things it does do right. If you love this genre and play it to death, a buck towards these devs might help to allow them to continue refining their craft and maybe realize their dream of releasing an epic-tier shmup. You'll have a good time regardless on the higher levels, and the RPG-like ship customizations after each story level offers a nice change of pace. If anyone has made it this far and has an interest in the genre, but might feel intimidated by the often high level of difficulty and skill required - this is absolutely your excellent starting point and the price couldn't be easier to swallow to see if these kind of games can be for you. If it turns out that they are, do realize that there's a next level and proceed to move on to more pricey but higher quality titles like Astebreed, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, and any game made by Cave.Star Saviors may not reach the high goals set by the titles it aspires to, but it's amazing that a $1 title can even make an honest attempt at that level. I recommend it to anyone who's curious or even anyone who enjoys arcade space shooters. I'd say the amount of words and time I've spent even talking about a game at this price level should say a lot.			"

At least you will be playing trading-car-simulator = aka win-win!I nominated this game to The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” !			"

It has 3 different ships each better in one aspect than the others, u got perks, multiple weapons, and lots and lots of projectiles. Dear Credits u have my greatest gratitude!!!

												First impressions but I can tell this Shmup is one of the good one's.Awesome Shmup.Instant classic in my opinion.Reminds me a little bit of the CAVE style Shmups which I like.Heaps of features should keep you engrossed for quite some time.Highly recommended.Defaults to keyboard so make sure you change to controller in the game's settings if you have/use one.

												Star Saviors is really, really one of the best shoot'em ups on Steam. Curious to know why? Here are some pros and cons:Pros:-Great and unique level design in many areas-Many game modes-A lot of weapons customizations-Very good sountrack-Achievements-Very responsive controls-Balanced gameplay-Unlimited continues-Very great boss battles-Good story-EtcCons:-Awful characters faces-The game is very easy, but gets immediately muuuuuuuuuuuch harder at the final boss, making the difficulty unbalanced and it make me rage quite a lot.Not only is this a masterpiece, but it's a masterpiece that's cheap. Very unexpensive! Star Saviors is an excellent shoot'em up, and it is inspired by many of the greatest shmups ever, like the excellent Raiden franchise, and Ikaruga. And if you played those games, you can clearly see how it's inspired by those games.I'd give this game a 9,7/10. A true gem.This game is one of the best 1$ you will spend on Steam. ;)			"

												This game is Legit.Controls are slick.Enemies are hard but rewarding.Upgrade system is interesting.STORY MODE.Cons:Occasionally there are so many things on the screen at once that there is no way to tell what is going on and some of the effects are lost.Side Fire Mode is a cool idea but suffers from a lack of power in lower levels.

Even at normal difficulty the game is extremely challenging yet quite fair, leaving you to stubbornly try to adapt to the pattern of attacks to finally rejoice as you claim your victory. Also has some neat cards and TONS of achievements, there's no reason not to buy this game, it'll keep you busy for a while, and it's cheaper than a chocolate bar.			"

												The game's mechanics are terrible. The enemies simply use your keyboard input as a targeting mechanic, the result being similar to the simple plastic mechanical games that you used to find at dollar stores. I was a huge fan of Galaga. I played it wherever I could find it. My friends always knew when I was younger that, if I went missing, to just look for the closest Galaga game. I love the format, but this doesn't do it justice.Beyond that, I found the dialog irritating. The author seemed to think they were being witty, or tongue-and-cheek, but it just came across as childish and ignorant. What the teacher says during the tutorial, for instance, stands behind the premise that you have somehow forgotten what you're doing and constantly surfaces how silly it is. The author is trying to say that tutorials are silly in the first-place, as your character should already know what they're doing. Of course, a tutorial is always needed when undertaking a new task. Why would we assume our character isn't just learning how to fly a ship? Why would we imply that they already know how to fly one, but have just forgotten for some reason?Sorry, I just had to rant. It's a top-down shooter; you could care less about the dialog. So, then, in conclusion: This game is a horrible example of the format with nothing to elevate it beyond others in its genre and isn't worth the 19 cents I paid for it. I've uninstalled it and can safely say that not even the most boring of Saturday afternoons can make me second-guess that decision.			"

												Gotta admit that level progression and guns diversity is pretty good in this game.I'm giving a negative review because the game is one of the ugliest things i've played. Ships looks all like liveless grey boxes, feels like just pressing fire and dodging colors, because there's nothing to see.			"

												Cheap game. Lacks any elegance. Does not fit into the category ""Retro"" because of modern, but still ugly graphics. Everything looks generic and cheap. 2 Player coop mode is a plus, but I would not dare to present a friend of mine such a game. There are much better shoot em up games out there like SYDER ARCADE. For me even the 19 Cents were wasted.			"

												For it's price, I can't really complain I suppose. But this game was pretty bad. If you have no money to spare, it might be a good purchase. If you have $5 just pick up another game of this type. There are many of them, and they are much more appealing.			"

												The game is a classic shoot them up. Initial impression of the first 3 hours is good. You unlock certain attacks after going through the levels, and level up your ship. After the completion of the easy campaign, you lose all your unlocks and starts over, which I don't like. Also, certain starting weapon types are just not good to start with. Once you fall behind, the levels gets even harder since there is no way to grind for more experience. I don't feel the motivation to continue playing.			"

												Got the game for free, but still this game is a very budget shooter.The controls are not good, the graphic are worse than the arcade shooters in the 90's.Only redeeming value is the price. On sale it's probably worth it just for the trading card.  "

												The game looks fun, and dont get me wrong, some aspects are fun. Getting a ""Break""(what does that even mean) Combo and seeing all of the ships being blown up. The cool boss battles. But the other 90 percent of this game is uninspired, badly made, badly written, and/or stale. Don't get me started on the frankly gross talking heads that reprisent ""characters"". They are about as far away from characters you can get. Badly written lines, no story and so badly made that seriously they NEED to hire a new graphic designer. Well, ya might say, it's an action game for being action game's sake. It doesn't need a story. And, well, it just might be better without a story. The game is a really overused concept, the ""shooty the thingies to save the world"" trope, executed badly. No, scratch that. Horribly. As worse as possible.Bottom Line(TL:DR): If you want a shmup that has great game mechanics and executed well, along with replayability and hours of real fun don't buy this game. Games like Ikaruga or Radiant Silvergun are way better (an understatement), even though they are more expensive then the couple cents they are selling this flaming piece of horse poop.			"

												If you like shooters, this is a very fun game. Enemies can often overwhelm the screen even on the lowest difficulties, creating a unique situation where the gamer is pulled deeper into the game.  Although, this doesn't last for long seeing as the levels are pretty short, lasting only a few minutes a piece.  The weapon system takes a little getting used to, forcing the player to pick wisely between weapons which provide high levels of damage, or good coverage, but seldom both.For the price it is a great game that is fun to play.  And is a solid addition to anyone's library who legitimately likes shooters.  Replayability should be decent.  But considering the length of the levels, it's not going to be something that you'll likely play for hours on end.			"

												Star Saviors is a very mediocre and generic space shoot 'em up.The game design and enemy waves are rather boring, the UI is poorly made, the graphics are often ugly, the sound effects are terrible and the story is absolute rubbish.Star Saviors is certainly not the best bullet hell experience on Steam like the developers claim or even a particularly good one. Not recommended.The good:- Nice variety of weaponsThe bad:- Uninspired enemy designs and attack patterns- Poor graphics and UI- Bad sound design- Hideous talking heads- Story is absolute rubbish			"

												I picked this game up on a Steam Sale for $0.19 and am just blown away by it.The graphics are nice (aside from the avatars, those are fugly but since you hardly ever see them it isn't a big deal), the gameplay is fun, and  the soundtrack is great.The one thing I think was definitely lacking is a key that allows you to slow your movement when held, something very valuable in a bullet-hell type game. The added precision of movement would have been very nice in some sequences.Is this game worth the regular price tag of $5? I would say yes, it's worth at least an hour or two of entertainment, possibly more depending on how big a fan of shooters you are. At the sale price though, it's a no-brainer.Buy this game.			"

												Pros: + Reasonable price+ Provides challenging gameplay (even the Normal will give you quite difficulty killing the bosses).+ Variable modes: single player, coop, arcade, endless+ Has potential, but...Cons:+ Fails to live up to its promises (see below)+ Poorly designed characters: not effects the gameplay, but definitely has negative impact on your experience with the game+ Uninteresting, simple story: it's not very engaging and exciting+ Bugs: the game usually crashes in certain setting and unplayable in Easy in a level→ For those who are into hell bullet games, this is for you. For those who aren't, give it a try but I recommended only buy it when on sale to save you some money.6/10			"

												This game is old school and you'll find yourself reminiscing about the ""good ol' days."" It has a nice classic/arcade style feeling and can offer a few hours of amusement. I got the game for like .79 cents with a coupon so it was a no brainer, but even for the $4.99 it's hard to argue with. You could easily go through $5 at an arcade in a fraction of the time this game will give you. Now for a couple negatives.. The dialogue is all text and is pretty dry, you'll see what I mean if you buy it. The game is fairly short, but with a few different characters and difficulties to choose from you have some replayability options. Also, it's fun to just hop on for a few minutes and shoot some ♥♥♥♥, or challenge a buddy to a high score contest.			"

But I'm going to be honest, it's actually pretty fun!They really put the hell in Bullet hell here in this old school game, extremely hard, yes, but extremely fun too. Pros:-Challenging-Cool boss fights-You get to move you ship not just up down left and right but you switch direction as well sometimes with cool camera switches-Arcade mode offers a variety of different preset ships.-You get to choose between main characters-Very rewarding explosions :D-Star Wars-ish textures and graphicsCons-Bad sound-The face textures look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-You dont get upgrades from killing enemies, you get it from beating levels, so sometimes it's impossible to beat a level-Makes you feel like ♥♥♥♥, since your playing a really small game more then you should be, since it's so fun!

												the super-cheesy storyline doesn't really detract from the GREAT SHMUP ACTION,complete with the constant flow of new main and side and secondary weapons, and various ship-enhancing perks that one can choose to customize one of the 3 basic ships,or what appear to be additional ships earned through gameplay feats.  the music and graphics are pretty butt-kickingly good, too!but yeah, the story is pure shmup cheese, and the character animations are... chewing gum, slowly?that's okay, though.  I don't mind the cheese or the radio-portrait oddity.the gameplay is where it's at, and it's done really well!it's hard even in ""Easy"" difficulty -- I shudder to think what it's like on ""Insane""!

												This game plays like a regular shmup, but what I like most in Saviors is the music.  It makes me feel that I'm relaxing in a peaceful Sunday morning.  The background music is probably one of the most soothing tunes I've heard in my life.It's a shame that the game can't seem to detect my fightstick and use it as a controller.

												Kinda reminds you of those top view scrolling shooting games at the arcades.  Easily worth $0.19 that I got it for.  Has a story mode, an arcade mode and a survival mode so there is something to casually play after you already beat the story mode (shouldnt take you too long).  And plus, if you are bored on a weekend you can pass the time by blowing stuff up for a while - not a whole lot of thinking, just a bunch of arcade explosions.  Fun game.  Wouldnt have purchased it unless it was on sale, but I can see myself replaying this if im bored and in need of a mindless shooter game so id say its worth the $5.  Fun game.			"

												Good customization, short, and challenging yet fun. It doesn't lie, it is a bullet hell, but if you are looking for a good story too, then you don't want it. The graphics are good for everything except the humans, those just look nasty. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of bullet hell chaos shooters, but not to someone who wants a decent story, its weak and short. Either way, this game wants to be more of the bullet hell shooter than the story type, and it doesn't lie.			"

A nice variety of enemies and attack patterns that aren't too repetitive. Personally I'd prefer if enemy bullets looked more similar, like closer to the same color, but it does add more challenge if you like that.Ignore the Genre tags on here; this is in no way an RPG or Strategy game.

												The characters look like hell. They have some seriously deformed faces that look like they came out of the psone era of gaming. Don't let that hold you back though. The game has a really great electronic / rock soundtrack and plays very smoothly. It's a little easier than other bullet hell type of games but fits right in the middle of bullet hell and shoot em up. On normal mode, I usually die within the first 3 stages losing all my lives and being asked if I want to continue or not. In this game, I can make it through stages and I can see why they made this game a little easier. There is no continue in this game. You can only restart from the beginning of the stage and only have one life. However, you can upgrade your ships shield, fire power and self healing abilities to give you a fighting chance against all the enemies who will flood your screen who will test your reflex abilities and show no mercy.It's a very fun game just like every shoot em up type of game. I seriously recommend it. Don't forget to buy the $0.99 soundtrack either! It's seriously worth it. Take care guys and happy shooting!			"

												I don't often write reviews, but this game really appeals to me. It's a standard, by-the-books vertical shooter. There are no random / procedural components to it. The game is short, I suppose (I've seen every level, even if on easy, in less than three hours). There's only one ship, and the weapon power-ups are probably from a text book... the game graphics are good, but not great.But holy crap, I had a lot of fun. I feel guilty for just paying $2 for the game and the soundtrack. This is a really well-done game. The story is a little eye-rolly with the poorly-CG'd characters, but I never found myself skipping it. I was genuinely engaged.The ship is easy to control and, even though there's really no need for it, there's a witty little tutorial, too. Lots of bright, colorful explosions, several game modes, and a very professional-- if a little dated-- presentation make this game a must-own, especially for the fast-food prices.Saving the best for last-- this game has a wonderful soundtrack. Listen to the promo video. That's just one track. There are, I believe 12 in the game... and they're all really good. In most games, I disable the music and rock my own. This time, I made sure to listen to the music... and for the first time in recent memory (after ""Oriand the Blind Forest""), I found it playing in my head long after playing the game.Very strongly recommended little game. It's got obvious heart.			"

												I got it in a pack of three games for about 55 cents total.My first impression of this game was dreadful and that was almost entirely due to the horrible talking animation the characters have for the dialog during the tutorial. I skipped any further dialog once the tutorial was finished.The third level where you fight one of the first major bosses is where the game starts to shine, and it gets better from there.You've got to be good at dodging hundreds of bullets all flying around the screen at once for those boss fights though. I haven't tried anything above normal difficulty at the moment, but I'm certain to give the higher difficulties a serious try later.Edit: finished insane story mode. It was very difficult.Overall, It's a very fun game.The music is great! It was actually good enough to convince me to get the ost when it was on sale for 49 cents.The graphics (If I pretend the talking animation doesn't exist.) are great.The story...uh...well...It doesn't need one, but it has something resembling a story I guess.I definitely recommend this game.

												The best modern arcade I've ever played. With 3 game modes including single player campaign with actual plot. For 0,79$ it is just 10/10 and I bought it only for 0.19$, so if we count the price of trade cards I practically got it for free.But before you buy it I should warn that it is quite difficult. It is difficult on normal and on hard or insane.. I have no idea who could beat this game on insane. I'm not oldschool hardcore arcade player, but I'm quite hardcore player by modern standards, so if you are casual player then it would be a real challenge for even on easy(which is not that EASY at all).

												I had this game bundled with the Hyperspace Pack. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play it because of the XNA HiDef problem which prevents you from playing in certain video cards even if it's not really needed. I've read that it is an option for the programmers that is usually overlooked and left as is even though the game does not need the HiDef parameter to run properly. I hope we can get an update that solves this problem so I can finally give a real review.			"

												This game is kind of amazing. I don't mean that it is a masterpiece or anything like that. It is fun, and has cool features, like choosing between firing from your sides or all forward. It doesn't look terrible, and has some decent music. It provides a nice challenge as well. The leveling up and getting new weapons is a pretty nice feature too. The thing I find crazy about this game is the story, basically the fact that it exists. It is thrown in your face without knowing what it has to do with anything and is told to you by these faces that just look terrible. I think the gameplay is pretty solid and fun. But the story is something worth seeing, because it is so ridiculous and it makes you laugh a lot between missions.			"

Saviors doesn't mince words or waste time. It throws you right into the heart of a laser-heavy space battle and lets somebody else do the explaining. In honor of that, I will try to be brief.Saviors is a ""gamer's game."" It is fully aware that it is a game, and seems to be fine if you are, too. Immersion is only one path to greatness as a video game product, and this game shows that you don't need to re-invent the wheel if you've got a really good wheel.The gameplay is incredibly smooth. Three buttons and arrows, and go get 'em, tiger. I had never heard the slang term ""bullet hell"" for the scrolling shooter genre, but it took about twenty-five seconds to make perfect sense. Saviors nails a very difficult design concept: the controls should fit like a glove, but that doesn't mean that every task should be intuitive. A few formations will make you think twice or leave you guessing, but unlike so many games that use unpredictability and no-win situations to cheaply raise difficulty, you can always hunker down in Saviors and juice a little more playtime out of sheer instinct.My big complaint - and the reason that I don't recommend it for everybody, everywhere, is that its presentation is that of several very good parts that don't make a cohesive whole. I have to admit that I do favor the ability to immerse myself in a game world, and each of the elements here don't quite go together. The sprites and particles have different reflective properties, and neither quite look like they are a part of the world painted by the backgrounds. The soundtrack is vivid and pulse-pounding, but it sounds like it was for a completely different game and overpowers the sound effects by default. For this style of game, I get that many gamers mute the game audio and throw on their own esoteric techno or speed-metal soundtracks, but as a casual gamer, I like to see the little touches that give me more than a series of well-designed levels: they give me a world to play through.Saviors gets truly difficult, but it definitely starts off at an inviting level, so people new to the genre (like me) can work their way in. At all levels, though, it gets perhaps the most important part of this genre right: you will have one or two moments per level where you ask yourself, ""How on earth did I get myself out of that one?"" It's intense and addictive. This is a superbly-designed game at a very attractive price. If you like space shooters at all, or want to find out if you do, buy right away.			"

												If you are into gigantic bosses, new upgrades every two or so levels and moving scenes then Saviors is the game for you!I played this for half an hour and already I am addicted, loads of soft colours and smooth animation. If you are very short tempered however... Well you might not survive the third level.My advice if you want to become a pro at this game is hold [Z] (The shooting button) and just look at all the projectiles rather than focus on the enemies.

SaviorsPros ~ Great soundtrack makes the levels more exciting to playYou can easily lose yourself in the game it's quite addictiveThe variation of ship weapons makes levels more versatile when you play around with the weapon style you likeThe explosions of enemy vessels are very satisfying!Cons ~ If you're not used to the gameplay style bosses can be a bit difficult.The cutscenes between levels on story mode lack the energy provided during gameplay, I found myself skipping straight to the levels due to no interest in the story itself and the characters look a little strange.If you are vulnerable to motion sickness the backgrounds of the levels can sometimes trigger it if you play for a long time in one sitting; I recommend taking breaks inbetween gaming if you experience this, when you go back to it you'll be fine again.Tips ~ If you're like me and have never played a game like this before and you just want to try it out and play because it looks cool and fun, the best tip I can offer that I've learned so far is to not get distracted watching the enemy ships, instead watch their fire. Sometimes spamming your weapons makes it harder to dodge, take certain boss levels slowly and balance offence and defence and finally, like with any game, the more you play it the easier it gets and you start to adapt to the style of play – there's also no shame in playing it on an easier difficulty to get the hang of it first!Overall Summary~I bought the game when it was on sale for 15p and it was literally worth every penny. If you fancy a fast paced, spaceship shooting game to pass some time and distract you, buy this game when it's on sale, it's surprisingly fun.			"

												Saviors is a bullet hell done in a classic fashion with modern amenities.  I installed it on my laptop to have some entertainment while away from my main gaming machine.  Here are the important specs:Dual Core AMD Athlon 2.0 GHz2GB RAMNvidia 8200mWindows 10I was able to turn bloom off and run native resolution (1366x768) at 60FPS with no major lag.  A few slow-downs here and there during high intensity fights, but that is to be expected for such an old machine.  That being said, it's stable, runs well on this bucket-o'-bolts, and it's enjoyable.  The story mode isn't deep, but you don't need anything crazy intense to justify a shmup like this, anyways.  The survival mode is pretty fun, too.  There's also an option for local-co-op.Thumbs up!			"

												Overall - 4.5/5 - A GREAT BARGAIN!Saviors does indeed provide salvation, from both boredom and the xeno threat. Though at the end of BGR's price range for budget games, this title offers hours of replay with a selection of game modes, plenty of Steam features, and a nice combination of shooter and RPG elements. If you're a fan of top-down shmups, but want something with a little extra in the gameplay department at a reasonable price, check this title out.Check out the full review for this game and more at Budget Gaming Review!http://www.budgetgamingreview.com/2015/08/saviors.html "

												Good customization, short, and challenging yet fun. It doesn't lie, it is a bullet hell, but if you are looking for a good story too, then you don't want it. The graphics are good for everything except the humans, those just look nasty. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of bullet hell chaos shooters, but not to someone who wants a decent story, its weak and short. Either way, this game wants to be more of the bullet hell shooter than the story type, and it doesn't lie.			"

												One of the best shmups on Steam, though not quite as pure as, say, Ikaruga since you can pick your weapon and ship. A nice variety of enemies and attack patterns that aren't too repetitive. Personally I'd prefer if enemy bullets looked more similar, like closer to the same color, but it does add more challenge if you like that.Ignore the Genre tags on here; this is in no way an RPG or Strategy game.

												Bought it for cards with a great discount initially, but decided to try it out since it was marked as a bullet hell, and had a lot of fun.In fact, this is not a bullet hell (danmaku), rather it is a classic shoot'em up game from back 90's, with a decent graphics, unlockables, several game modes etc.The idea is that you fly forward, destroying a bunch of regular enemies and some bosses, some will need you to come up with a meaningful strategy. There are upgrades between levels, which are unlocked with your score: the higher the score, the more upgrade points you get. There seems to be some story in story mode, but I stopped reading around second level, because it is not very good.The music is ok I guess, but I am very picky with this aspect.The game does borrow some aspects from danmaku, but generally it remains a classic game.Overall, this is a very decent game, probably worth its full price and definitely worth its price with a discount.

Also you receive weapons just by the time you master previous weapons.

												The characters look like hell. They have some seriously deformed faces that look like they came out of the psone era of gaming. Don't let that hold you back though. The game has a really great electronic / rock soundtrack and plays very smoothly. It's a little easier than other bullet hell type of games but fits right in the middle of bullet hell and shoot em up. On normal mode, I usually die within the first 3 stages losing all my lives and being asked if I want to continue or not. In this game, I can make it through stages and I can see why they made this game a little easier. There is no continue in this game. You can only restart from the beginning of the stage and only have one life. However, you can upgrade your ships shield, fire power and self healing abilities to give you a fighting chance against all the enemies who will flood your screen who will test your reflex abilities and show no mercy.It's a very fun game just like every shoot em up type of game. I seriously recommend it. Don't forget to buy the $0.99 soundtrack either! It's seriously worth it. Take care guys and happy shooting!			"

												A little gem of a game. It takes the best stuff from 8-bit scroll space shooters genre and adds a smoothgraphics (except of pilots faces - those belongs to Left4Dead or Day-Z) with a beautiful oldschool feeling. You can expect some frantic action and colourful explosions from this game (there's an option in the menu to turn it up to 120FPS). And some of the levels, bossess especially, are quite demanding on an ""Easy"" level. 9 points out of 10  (minus 1 point because of the pilots. I've still got a nightmares). For £0.79 it's a steal.PS: An analog/digital controller is a must have to play this game comfortably.			"

												I don't often write reviews, but this game really appeals to me. It's a standard, by-the-books vertical shooter. There are no random / procedural components to it. The game is short, I suppose (I've seen every level, even if on easy, in less than three hours). There's only one ship, and the weapon power-ups are probably from a text book... the game graphics are good, but not great.But holy crap, I had a lot of fun. I feel guilty for just paying $2 for the game and the soundtrack. This is a really well-done game. The story is a little eye-rolly with the poorly-CG'd characters, but I never found myself skipping it. I was genuinely engaged.The ship is easy to control and, even though there's really no need for it, there's a witty little tutorial, too. Lots of bright, colorful explosions, several game modes, and a very professional-- if a little dated-- presentation make this game a must-own, especially for the fast-food prices.Saving the best for last-- this game has a wonderful soundtrack. Listen to the promo video. That's just one track. There are, I believe 12 in the game... and they're all really good. In most games, I disable the music and rock my own. This time, I made sure to listen to the music... and for the first time in recent memory (after ""Oriand the Blind Forest""), I found it playing in my head long after playing the game.Very strongly recommended little game. It's got obvious heart.			"

												I rate the game Saviors (also known as Star Saviors) 4/5. Good.Perhaps the best thing about this game is that it is only 2 dollars and it gives you an amazing amount of gameplay for the price of just 2 candybars. In many ways Saviors is very, very similar to Revolution Ace or Raptor: Call of the Shadows. This is a ""schmup"" (Whatever that stands for) game which features multiple play modes but particularly focuses on a main campaign wherein you choose a ship and progress through a series of areas upgrading your ship as you go. The campaign is done fairly well as are the various other modes of play (survival, arcade etc.). This game really shines in terms of how many options it gives you, particularly the fact that this game can either be really easy or really hard depending on which difficulty you choose (and a moderate difficulty really is moderately difficult). On the downside, like in Revolution Ace and Raptor: Call of the Shadows, the environments you fly over just creep along in an incredibly lethargic manner.

Though at the end of BGR's price range for budget games, this title offers hours of replay with a selection of game modes, plenty of Steam features, and a nice combination of shooter and RPG elements. If you're a fan of top-down shmups, but want something with a little extra in the gameplay department at a reasonable price, check this title out.Check out the full review for this game and more at Budget Gaming Review!http://www.budgetgamingreview.com/2015/08/saviors.html "

												Good customization, short, and challenging yet fun. It doesn't lie, it is a bullet hell, but if you are looking for a good story too, then you don't want it. The graphics are good for everything except the humans, those just look nasty. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of bullet hell chaos shooters, but not to someone who wants a decent story, its weak and short. Either way, this game wants to be more of the bullet hell shooter than the story type, and it doesn't lie.			"

The music was great but there is a common sense that the graphics can be better. Also there may be a shop system that you can buy guns, bombs etc. But there is no controller for mouse ( or I could not figure it out :D ). Overall it is in my top 10 list of space shooter games.

Got this when it was on sale for 19 cents and it is a complete steal. This is worth the full price easily. Pros:- Responsive gameplay that rewards skill- Unlockable weapons- Unlockable perks- 3 playable ships- Clear visuals- Nice colorful aesthetics- Nice explosion/particle effectsCons:- Laughably bad 3d models and animations at every level intro (but it's skippable)- Unclear when perks/weapons unlock- Story is weak (but for this genre it is normal)Highly recommended even at full price. 9/10 "

												I rate the game Saviors (also known as Star Saviors) 4/5. Good.Perhaps the best thing about this game is that it is only 2 dollars and it gives you an amazing amount of gameplay for the price of just 2 candybars. In many ways Saviors is very, very similar to Revolution Ace or Raptor: Call of the Shadows. This is a ""schmup"" (Whatever that stands for) game which features multiple play modes but particularly focuses on a main campaign wherein you choose a ship and progress through a series of areas upgrading your ship as you go. The campaign is done fairly well as are the various other modes of play (survival, arcade etc.). This game really shines in terms of how many options it gives you, particularly the fact that this game can either be really easy or really hard depending on which difficulty you choose (and a moderate difficulty really is moderately difficult). On the downside, like in Revolution Ace and Raptor: Call of the Shadows, the environments you fly over just creep along in an incredibly lethargic manner. There really isn't very much of a thrilling sense of speed and to make matters worse, the environments you fly over tend to be fairly boring.

												I don't often write reviews, but this game really appeals to me. It's a standard, by-the-books vertical shooter. There are no random / procedural components to it. The game is short, I suppose (I've seen every level, even if on easy, in less than three hours). There's only one ship, and the weapon power-ups are probably from a text book... the game graphics are good, but not great.But holy crap, I had a lot of fun. I feel guilty for just paying $2 for the game and the soundtrack. This is a really well-done game. The story is a little eye-rolly with the poorly-CG'd characters, but I never found myself skipping it. I was genuinely engaged.The ship is easy to control and, even though there's really no need for it, there's a witty little tutorial, too. Lots of bright, colorful explosions, several game modes, and a very professional-- if a little dated-- presentation make this game a must-own, especially for the fast-food prices.Saving the best for last-- this game has a wonderful soundtrack. Listen to the promo video. That's just one track. There are, I believe 12 in the game... and they're all really good. In most games, I disable the music and rock my own. This time, I made sure to listen to the music... and for the first time in recent memory (after ""Oriand the Blind Forest""), I found it playing in my head long after playing the game.Very strongly recommended little game. It's got obvious heart.			"

SaviorsPros ~ Great soundtrack makes the levels more exciting to playYou can easily lose yourself in the game it's quite addictiveThe variation of ship weapons makes levels more versatile when you play around with the weapon style you likeThe explosions of enemy vessels are very satisfying!Cons ~ If you're not used to the gameplay style bosses can be a bit difficult.The cutscenes between levels on story mode lack the energy provided during gameplay, I found myself skipping straight to the levels due to no interest in the story itself and the characters look a little strange.If you are vulnerable to motion sickness the backgrounds of the levels can sometimes trigger it if you play for a long time in one sitting; I recommend taking breaks inbetween gaming if you experience this, when you go back to it you'll be fine again.Tips ~ If you're like me and have never played a game like this before and you just want to try it out and play because it looks cool and fun, the best tip I can offer that I've learned so far is to not get distracted watching the enemy ships, instead watch their fire. Sometimes spamming your weapons makes it harder to dodge, take certain boss levels slowly and balance offence and defence and finally, like with any game, the more you play it the easier it gets and you start to adapt to the style of play – there's also no shame in playing it on an easier difficulty to get the hang of it first!Overall Summary~I bought the game when it was on sale for 15p and it was literally worth every penny. If you fancy a fast paced, spaceship shooting game to pass some time and distract you, buy this game when it's on sale, it's surprisingly fun.			"

												One of the best shmups on Steam, though not quite as pure as, say, Ikaruga since you can pick your weapon and ship. A nice variety of enemies and attack patterns that aren't too repetitive. Personally I'd prefer if enemy bullets looked more similar, like closer to the same color, but it does add more challenge if you like that.Ignore the Genre tags on here; this is in no way an RPG or Strategy game.

												Best Euroshmup I've ever played.This is the euro STG style done RIGHT! Specifically the european PC breed of shooters with RPG elements. Fair bullet patterns, lots of upgrade fun, a full arcade mode and plenty of challenge. Music is awesome if not a bit repetitive. Backgrounds can leave a bit to be desired, but the graphics are mainly in the bullets, which look spectacular, with plenty of colour and variety. Story mode is long, I'm not sure how long, I'm 18 levels in. They're mostly all really well-designed levels, albeit a bit easy on Normal mode. It won't you go back to earlier levels and annihilate ♥♥♥♥ with your upgraded weapons, and you only earn upgrades if you survive the level you're playing. This means there's no grinding to be done, which is a plus, and you'll simply have to retry the levels until you can beat them. A level select at some point would be helpful to practice stages without going through the entire story mode. Getting stuck on a hard level can be frustrating since you can't go back to an earlier level to cool off, and you can't have multiple saved games, so you're stuck there unless you wanna start over from the beginning, but at least then you can use a different perks upgrade strategy if your previous one wasn't working. Earned weapons you can switch between anytime, and only the perks are permanent. But you can undo your *most recent* perks upgrade and pick a different one at (I believe) any point.More to be written once I have some more time with the game.If you're on the fence about this game, you've probly played a few lackluster euro-type shooters or you've noticed the slew of mediocre $2.00 shooters on Steam and other platforms. Well this is nothing like that, this is a super fun game that that uses many elements of the euro style without being weakened by sloppy design or cheap deaths. If you're not into the story mode and messing with weapon sets and perks, the arcade mode is perfect, you just pick a preset weapon configuration and that's what you have for the whole game. There's also a Survival Score Attack mode.Don't pay attention to any of the game's descriptions on Steam. This game has little to do with Raiden or Radiant Silvergun andf almost nothing to do with Ikaruga. It's also more about being a UK PC RPG STG than it is about being a bullet hell. There are fast bullets like Raiden and Various weapons, vaguely similar I guess, the RSG, but that's quite a stretch. I really feel the ad copy for this game gives the wrong impression. Think Tyrian 2000. This game is like Tyrian 2014, and all for the better.			"

												I feel like I commited a crime paying $0.49 for this. It was well worth the money and I only have .2 hrs on record. I'd instantly buy Part II if they made it better than this one. Great game guys! If you guys need an soundtrack music PLEASE contact me. I am I producer and i will do it for FREE! Just slide me a copy of the game ;)			"

												Solid shooter for its price. Has a lot of good features like online scoreboards, replays, co-op, multiple ship types and game modes, and a really good soundtrack. Theres a lot of value and you will get a lot more playtime than expected.			"

												The shooter segments of this game are pretty dang good. They look good, they feel good to play, and the music is nice as well. The plot leaves something to be desired, and the characters are... well they need to be seen to be believed. That's a bit of a tradition in SHMUPs though, so it's nothing to really worry about. Difficulty wise, this game will be on the easier side for SHMUP veterans, but the harder settings should still provide enough challenge for a good time. I recommend this game, over all.			"

												Mechanically, an interesting and solid SMHUP. The UI could use some work, taking up a good chunk of your screen as it does for no real reason, and the talking heads are...well. Hideous. I barely understand or care about the plot, given that it's all completely skippable text conversations with said hideous talking heads moving their mouths.My suggestion? Remove the talking heads, since they don't add anything to the game. Games like this are all about the ships anyways. Maybe add some voiceovers for between-mission stages, and keep the plot inside the gameplay instead of in the level select screens. Build the tutorial into the beginning of the game, somehow, and introduce concepts gradually.			"

												Mission Briefings were so cringy I couldn't read past the 2nd sentence.Character designs and face details were also horrendous and ugly and unappealing.There are no settings to remove the ""BIG NUMBERS"" after killing an enemy ship,  after a while, th ose numbers get in the way.   I don't care about numbers or top score, I just want to destroy stuff without thinking about attaining a high score.An option to remove those numbers would be nice.  Gameplay is 10/10,  I would reccomend to anyone who wants a great game. Can't beat the price, honestly.			"

												Ah, good old memories with arcade games. The graphics are nice and the levels are easy to beat. Haven't tried the onlinw feature but will surely do someday.			"
