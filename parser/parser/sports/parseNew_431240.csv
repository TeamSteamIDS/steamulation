Early Access Review
Keep in mind, that I'm reviewing the current state of development.My ImpressionOriginally posted by FriendOfMine:I never thought this game would actually be so much fun!This pretty much sums it up. You will hear so much swearing, cheering and laughing playing this game the way it's supposed to be played - with your friends.TL;DRHere is my shortcut; the hole in one for this review.PositiveMediocreNegative+ Pretty maps~ not even a handful yet- Not optimized+ Different ways/paths to hit+ Custom Modifier- No Steam Integration~ The UI could use an overhaul+ Zooming in and out is possible- No free camera+ Relaxing Soundtrack~ some might find annoyingThe GameplayIt's Golfing - as easy as it gets - you hold the mouse button, move the mouse to change the strength and direction of your shot and release to hit the ball.You can also zoom in and out to get a better idea of the location of your goal, but sometimes it is obscured by obstacles so you won't be able to see where to hit at all - I really wish there was a free camera so you could inspect the level beforehand.The LevelsCurrently, there are 4 different levels: Forest, Desert, Moonlight Park, Spooky Mansion. An additional 2 are supposedly planned.Each map contains 18 holes and at least in the forest level you can finish it with 18 shots - but this will take you a lot of practice.The design is really neat and most of the time you can take more than one approach to hitting the ball.With to the many possibilities comes a big part of the replay value and the whole fun of the game. If you manage that one insane hit, none of your friends even thought about and you leave them wondering how you managed the hole in 2 strokes when they are on the 7th.MultiplayerCreating and joining a lobby is super easy, as well as setting up modifiers. Another big part of replaying this game will come from setting up different modifications - such as 'random ball shapes'. When the unlucky one with the acorn hits the hole in one - a♥♥♥♥♥♥storm will be unleashed :DHowever before even going into multiplayer, I advise you to paint your ball under 'Customize' - so you can be recognised by your friends. Just don't take the same colours.On the downside: you can't join a game through steam yet, which is a shame since you have to leaf through a few pages of games to find the one you are looking for.The VisualsAll the levels are really neatly designed and have a really cool air about them, to match a certain theme and bring you in the mood.The Forest, for example, is an all outside map, with a timber mill and saws and rolling logs around the place.The Desert features a pyramid theme with a sphinx and switches from an open-air level to an indoor level around the way.Moonlight Park is the currently only night level which has a really different feel from the other maps, it's quite magical.Last but not least in the mansion you will play all indoors and have ghosts spooking around as well as weird statues and trophies as well as cobwebs all over the place.However, in the current state of the game, some locations will just eat away your framerate - so you might have a look at your settings.The SoundI really like the sweet melody in the background, my friend, however, turned the volume way down because he couldn't stand it - so it's really a preference thing.The VerdictIf you have friends willing to play this game with you - by all means you can have a good time.However, there isn't that much content in the game yet. Of course, you can aim for the hole in one on every map (if this is even possible; I don't think it is), hone your skills by trying new hits and playing with funny settings but it depends on how long you and your friends will stay motivated together - because if the first one loses the interest, the others will probably follow.Also: always play with Collision - on. HateThank me later.Note:If you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.

								Good, laid back game to play with friends.  It might be even better than real mini golf because I don't have to go outside with my pale skin and worry about awkward social interactions.  The different settings are fun to try and keep the game interesting, and the devs are always updating with new maps and fixing bugs.  Keep up the great work guys!			"

								The game itself is really fun however the community of players is garbage, Good:The Devs of this game do a great job fixing problems, keeping people up to date, and adding new content. The game is actually really fun when your able to play and it's usually pretty stable for an early access game.Bad:The community. I understand the need to be able to kick a player due to ping problems or language however, this feature seems to get abused by hosts more often than used for its intended purposes. If you decide to join a random lobby instead of creating your own or playing with your friends, you better not be beating the host or you'll probably be kicked. Taking to long to line up your shots? You're probably gone. If you get somewhat good at the game (which you will because you'll learn the tricks to most holes) be prepaired to not finish games in random lobbies if you're beating the host.			"

Truly a remarkable mini golf game: It's in early access, so I wasn't surprised by the lack of maps (only 2 available). What I WAS surprised by, however, was both how smooth the gameplay is and how diverse the holes are. There is a colorful variety of custom options for the games, ranging from playing golf with cubes/eggs, to changing the gravity and changing how bouncy the balls are!I strongly recommend everyone to get this game if they have some friends that they can play it with, as I can see how it would get boring by yourself....just like real-life mini golf :>Cheers,-trippy			"

								10/10 Golf with your Friends is honestly worthy of GOTY. Here's why;Music: The music is mind-blowing for lack of better words. It is capable of giving you a wide arrange of fealings from happiness to legitimate depression and agony. I would absolutely recommend turning it up to max as you enjoy/scream through your game of Mini-Golf with your friends. The composer has truely accomplished a feat with the one repeating song that plays throughout the entire game. Physics: The physics in this game are surprisingly realistic and fair. That is, unless you change them so you're on the moon. Which brings me to my next point.Options/Customization: Do you not like your white ball? Change it to hot pink! Not like that you can't collide with your friends? Make it so you can! Not like the gravity? Drag a bar and take a trip to Mars! Not like being in 3rd Person? Use the scroll wheel to go into 1st Person mode! I was actually surprised with the amount of things you could change in this game, which is actually cheaper than the average sandwhich. Use that logic to convince your friends to buy this game so you don't have to play it by yourself. Trust me, It worked for me.Overall Graphics: For an early access game this is top tier. Honestly. The screenshots aren't cutscenes, there actually aren't any cutscenes in this game, I mean it's mini-golf why would there be? All the screenshots are in game footage. Crazy huh?It's Balanced: All the courses in this game are very well balanced, which suprised me since this is a golfing game. (aside for the ones you can access by turning on beta content, those need some work. Like ffs the Twilight map is hard af) Blacklight Interactive has done something spectacular with this game and I cannot wait for the Bogey Boy DLC. Great work guys.			"

Early Access Review
								Golf With Your Friends is a solid golf simulation game developed and published by Blacklight Interactive. Blacklight has three employees with two owners of which are brothers. The game itself is currently in Early Access, therefore, I will not harshly critique this review. The issues I will mentionI have placed in the forums for the developers to note down and fix in the future. The idea of this game is similar to real life golf, you complete levels whilst attempting to achieve the lowest score compared to your opponent in order to win. I really enjoyed this game and it was thanks to playing with friends, as the title suggests, because it creates competition between you and your friends and allows you all to have fun. The overall idea is simple, you play golf. The game features a lobby with recently-added filters to separate the password servers from the non-password servers. The filters feature is crucial to the matchmaking component of this game because as the title suggests, there are many more password-locked servers that are friends playing with friends instead of people playing with the community. You can play with up to 12 friends in multiplayer, adding a nice balance between friends playing and not over-doing it with friends per say. The three maps of Forest, Oasis, and the new map Twlight are all well designed. Forest is relatively basic but gradually increases in difficulty as the levels progress, which is beneficial to new players. Forest has a course surrounded by trees and it features some neat obstacles like spinning blades, rolling logs, and even targets that help you shoot towards the hole. Oasis is a level that is influenced by Egypt in its sandy landscape and it's pyramids with Holes within a pyramid. I like the level because it contrasts Forest and has water, thus it provides a difference with the maps. Furthermore, it's fairly difficult so I do like the challenge and map design of Oasis. Twlight is a standard golf course featuring different Holes. What makes it unique though is that it incorporates more water than Oasis and the course takes place at night, showcasing the luscious environment. Twlight allows you to step back and relax so you can enjoy the overall scenery. Twlight is my favourite course due to the night time and lights effect. Despite the small amount of features, the game has a clear direction with a simple concept and it delivers on that. Furthermore, the developers are absolutely excellent at communicating with the community on a daily basis if its informing them on direction, such as a roadmap, or responding to general queries. Blacklight is committed to this game and it shows in their work ethic because from when I purchased the game to now, the game has drastically improved and it feels more fluid than before. I played this on both my PC and my Macbook Air 2015 edition and there were differences in performance between both systems. My experience of this game on the Macbook was days after purchasing the game last month. Performance on it was choppy at best as the game lagged consistently despite my system surpassing the recommendations and despite me playing on low settings. My friend has a newer and more powerful Macbook Pro and he could play the game smoothly on medium settings and not on high. However, the performance on my PC has improved greatly since purchasing the game. At purchase, I played on high settings and in return my computer was loud, I wasn't able to sustain a stable FPS, and the game took up 16% of my CPU and up to 400mb of memory, per my task manager. Now, my computer does not run loud and I can sustain a solid 55-60FPS. Per my task manager, the game takes up 13% CPU and 350mb of memory and while not a great improvement, it is still an improvement nonetheless. Overall, while the game continues to perform better, much more improvement is needed.As I stated prior, the game features an abundance of issues. However, Blacklight have been effective at improving the game and removing bugs. And, I have made a regular contribution to the Golf With Your Friends forums on the issues I encountered as I do want to help them fix the game and succeed. At purchase, my main issues with the game were the physics and the lag that came with it. For instance, the majority of shots in courses would be overrun by lag and glitches in the physics of putting the ball. Currently, the game has made noticeable improvements in both areas but do occasionally occur.Overall, Golf With Your Friends is a solid Early Access title that is best played with friends to maximise your entertainment. It incorporates the simple feature of golf and this basic idea has been successful through the three well designed maps that are in different landscapes. It contains an excellent development team that listens to the community and wants to drastically improve this game. As with any Early Access title, it does have its fair share of bugs, but the development team has ironed out the main issues and is constantly improving this game with regular patches. This game is incredibly cheap at $5.99 and therefore if you have friends to play with I highly recommend this game because it's fun. If you intend to play solo, quite frankly it is your choice because it may get boring but at $6, nothing can go wrong.Note, for an Early Access title I won't do a ratings score.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Golf with you friends review.Pros:+ Excellent developers. + Many customization options.+ Provides hours of entertainment.+ Fairly inexpensive.+ Amazing courses.+ Consistent updates.Cons:- May feel repetitive.- No dedicated matchmaking.- Requires others for maximum enjoyment.MultiplayerOnline multiplayer is becoming an increasingly important factor in my decision to purchase games. With that said, I feel multiplayer in this game is rather lacking. Golf with your friends doesn't provide a dedicated matchmaking system. It does, however, grant you the option to create custom lobbies effortlessly.SummaryOverall, Golf With Your Friends is a solid game that is best played with others to maximize your entertainment. It contains an excellent development team that listens to the community and wants to improve the game drastically. The game is incredibly inexpensive at $5.99, and therefore if you have others to play with, I would highly recommend this game because it's quite enjoyable. If you intend to play solo, it may get repetitive fairly quickly, but is fantastic nonetheless.General : 8.5/10 "

If you host for random people they use guides to be the best and don't just have the fun, or kids who start raging and yelling if they can't win. It only has 4 levels.. for now. In january a new level will come out. And so will alot of other content (hopefully) in the future. These 4 levels are fun to play tho, there are alot of different courses.So..Play it with friends is really fun and I recommend that. But online.. nah, the community there is only wanting to win.			"

It is a quite fun mini-golf game with (currently) 4 courses that are pretty difficult.  You can change all sorts of characteristics in the game, such as ball color and shape, time per round, number of strokes and much more.  It is a load of fun to play with other people and even quite fun to play by yourself.  I've only played a few hours so far, but I see a lot of fun in my future.  Thanks for the great game!			"

Picked up a random game to enjoy with my friends, but quickly found out that this is not the game to maintain those friendships.---------------------------------------------------------Do you like sports games? Challenges with friends? Do you value your friendship? Don't want to ruin it? What about golf?Yes, I said it. Golf. Despite being one of the most boring sports in the world - in my opinion, of course - Golf With Your Friends manages to create a fun, entertaining, competitive, and challenging atmosphere for all to enjoy.Progress through a series of holes (waves) while keeping in my mind that you must clock in the least amount of strokes. Risk it all - just your friends that is - in this great little game that can be played with the whole family; what are you waiting for?!---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Believable physics+ Collisions with friends!+ Multiplayer mode is always great!+ Tons of customisation options available+ Different maps offer various amounts of challenges+ Manages to make golfing fun, and that's hard for someone like me+ Cheesy music that doesn't take away from the overall gameplay in any way+ Simple gameplay and very easy to play/understand (no crazy interafaces or controls to master)+ Ability to customise your golf ball: choose from many options in order to stand out from your friends+ Great price for the amount of content it currently offers (I picked it up at $4,79 on Steam); I would consider it a steal since you will be receiving more content later on in the future+ Active community = best news for a gamer (according to SteamCharts, there are 1,055 players playing now, with an all-time peak of 2,011. As this game continues to grow, I definitely see it becoming one of those games that people must have)Neutral± Ability to be competitive, but you risk your friendships should you emerge victorious± Some feautures that I think will be great but are not yet released: level editor and in-game currency that can be spent to customise your profile further. Will update this review when those are releasedCons- No controller support- Camera view spazzes out at times and this can get a bit annoying, especially when you're shooting and you get ""locked in"" to a bad angle- If you're prone to seizures, then be careful on the Oasis map. I think it's the 7th hole (I can't recall), but my golf ball got stuck underneath a pipe and my screen started spazzing out- Hard to get into a game with friends at the moment. The developer's said that they would work on this feature, but for now, it's annoying having to go through pages of lobby room's in order to find the one you want to join- Would be cool if the ball's could interact. Okay, this just sounds wrong, but what I mean is that if I were to hit my golf ball a certain way as my friend, then they would bounce off one another. This would increase the competitive value of the game by a lot I have been informed otherwise (thanks to Ian07)!---------------------------------------------------------This game is in Early Access mode, but seems quite well rounded for the amount of product offered. The company, Blacklight Interactive is made up of 3 people who appear to be truly dedicated to the game. It doesn't get any better than that.If you have a few bucks to spare, I definitely recommend this title. While you will have some raging moments, ultimately, you will have great memories with friends overall (and with new ones that you will make along the way). Give this game a try: you really won't regret it!Overall8.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions?

								UPDATE: They have changed the name to Golf With Your Friends, due to what i believe to be a copyright issuea, as expected the flamers have started up already. Please note that the name change does not affect how the game plays. fs.First of all, with only 2 courses, this game ranks in my top 5 for price paid per hour of gameplay at 0.41c per hour, compared to rocket league (058.c) Euro Truck Sim 2 (0.63c) Civ 5 (1.24$) etc. for the amount of gameplay you get, its so worth the money.This is the best mini golf game on steam already, only 3 months in to EA.The two man dev team are passionately active on the forums, always taking into consideration what the community would like to see, they patch and fix bugs within hours (Most of the time) and are working really hard to make GWF a game that the community wants.As for the gameplay, its terribly easy to point your aim and take a shot, but the difficulty comes from choosing the right power and path to the hole. If you play in a big enough lobby there is bound to be someone who is great at the game, who will be more than willing to teach you a trick or two!With workshop support and new maps/reward system and skins coming soon you'll want to get on board straight away!All in all a great little time consuming, semi-competitive mini golf game with boundless creativity that shows great promise if (like the community believes) the developers stay as passionate as they are already.9/10			"

								This is a very fun game to play with friends. It is definitely worth it for the low price tag even though there is not much content at the moment (more is on the way). MapsThe two maps that currently come with the game are very replayable and I have not noticed many bugs in them at all so far. One of them is called Forest and the other Oasis. At the moment Forest contains less bugs than Oasis which contains a few minor ones. MultiplayerThe mulitplayer lacks players but it is very easy to create your own server and you can play with up to 12 people. Joining servers is not as easy though as you have to go through a list of about 12 pages. A search tool would make this much easier. CustomisationCustomisation is also available in the game with the ability to change the colour of the ball. As well as this, you can customise your server settings to change the way you play the game. For example, you can change the shape of the balls to eggs and add an ability to jump whilst playing. Graphics 7/10Replayability 9/10Bugs 7/10Multiplayer 8/10Overall 7.75/10In my opinion this game is definitely worth a try and I think it is the best mini golf game out there.			"

								Surpsingly this is a pretty fun game, especially with friends. I thought it would contain typical mini golf maps but it's a lot more creative/unique than that. I never knew how intense a game of golf with friends could be until I played this. The game makes things a lot more interesting by adding custom settings, such as changing the shape of the ball, or decreasing gravity. I would definitely recommend this game. There are a few bugs here and there but nothing game changing. Unfortunately the only thing I can say that's negative is that it's not really worth $6 for only 4 maps and this game unexpectedly makes my computer very loud for a simple golf game. I understand that it's an early access game and so, I look forward to the many additions the developers will bring to the game.			"

								Even if you don't like golf as a sport this game provides tons of fun. It's nothing like traditional golf and up to 12 players can play together. Great online party game, if none of your friends own this game you can still play on public servers. More stuff is coming soon.			"

Golf With Your FriendsNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7 Nothing spectacular, but this is a mini-golf game we're talking about here. It gets the job done rather well.   Gameplay 8 You would think mini-golf could only go so far with its options. Oh how wrong you would be. Lower gravity, increase bounce, change the ball shape (cube, triangle, etc), turn on collision, and more. Though there are currently only three courses, expect many more, and in the mean time enjoy what there is to offer. A couple downsides to the current gameplay: It can be quite glitchy at times, particular when trying to putt into the hole. The method for hitting the ball could also use some work, as it occasionally triggers false-positives and you hit the ball when you didn't mean to.   Story N/A Just the ridiculous moments you'll laugh about over and over with friends.   Multiplayer 10 It has been a couple years since a game made me laugh this hard, this consistently, while playing with my friends. From watching them fail easy shots in hilarious ways, to hearing them cry out as their ball flies off the course, you'll find plenty of good times in this simple mini-golf game. The laughs kick up a notch once low-gravity and high bounce are enabled.   Replayability 7 In its current state, there aren't quite enough levels to keep you occupied for a significantly long period of time. But what is there will keep you coming back to try different modes with various friends.   Overall 7.8/10 With the promise of more to come, Golf With Your Friends already has a fantastic start. With three levels that have 18 holes each, and a surprisingly amount of customization in gameplay, it is the best mini-golf game I have encountered yet. For the price range, highly recommended if you want a few nights of laughs with your friends.

								Played this game in full 12 player lobbies where we were all on voice comms together. Mini golf with friends, as you'd expect, is a hillarious and great time. The game's price tag ($6) is a good price, especially when more courses/modes get added. You can also join open lobbies and play golf with strangers on the internet; this is a game that should be played with other people.			"

								Seems too simple to be fun. Don't wait for a sale, just buy it. Happy to pay $10 to be honest. Let's start with the music. Listen to the other reviews because it is true....ok moving on.At the moment there is Classic mode, which is stock standard mini golf, and there is Custom, which introduces cylinders, pyramids, cubes, and more. Low gravity, bouncy ground, and the friendship destroyer, collision. Luckily I am yet to play this with my friends! The community is great too. Of course it's not perfect, but it's still awesome.8/10When more game modes are added? 10/10EDIT: Two awesome new maps? Good enough for me.10/10			"

								Golf with your friends is one of the best, if not the best, mini golf game you can find here on Steam (and most places for that matter). It's pretty self-explained what the game is about, you play golf, with or without your friends. (Though playing with friends will give you an overall better experience, and if not, you need new friends).The game currently has four maps with a fifth one on the horizon, all of which has a different theme, you got your standard green forest type of map, a map set in the ancient Egypt, a map taking place in a enchanted magical forest, one in a haunted mansion and the fifth and upcoming one (as of this review) will feature a candyland sort of theme from my knowledge.The game does get somewhat repetitive after a few hours of gameplay once you figure out how every hole works and how to do well on them. This is a problem especially if you're playing multiplayer with strangers, and certain friends (Damn it Carl) since there is a handful of guides on Steam explaining how to get a hole-in-one or the best possible score on each hole, so more often than not you will play against someone who has memorized all the holes or just simply looking at a guide as they play.But there are a few settings you can play around with to spice things up incase you get bored such as: bigger golf balls, enable jumping (which makes the game way easier but is really enjoyable at the same time), enable gravity and so on.I haven't experienced any game-breaking bugs myself but the game is in Early Access so chances are there are a few bugs and glitches here and there that needs to be eliminated, aswell as more content being added in the future.For $6 this game is defenitely worth picking up, and you're able to get it for less during sales. And since it's not very expensive you can most likely talk some friends into buying it, or perhaps you can be generous and gift a copy to them. Very fun and enjoyable game to play casually!			"

YouTube™ Video: Golf with your Friends Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 691		

			In this video, we show a preview of the upcoming game ‘Golf with your Friends’ for Steam. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

Golf with friends is a mini-golf game in which revolves around playing online against other people. You can play single player for now but they soon plan to add in AI Enemies. I feel this game has a super amount of potential and will be very fun. Positives:+ Music - Awesome soundtrack which makes me happy+ Variety - The golf courses are real fun to play, they plan to add 6 in total but only have two on there for now. + Very cheap price – For the price of the game I feel it’s most definitely worth it. Even with just these two courses.Negatives:- Not a lot of content yet (but that’s obvious as it’s in Early Access and runs risk of never being completed)- There is no real set difficulties to the courses. Would be nice for an Easy Course, Medium Course and Very Hard course instead of progressive which I get stuck on towards the end. I’m a novice! ;)- The game gets a bit rugged in the desert area and doesn’t run as smooth as the grasslands.I had a refreshing time playing Golf with Friends, my only regret is that I have no friends. (joke) I didn’t manage to test out the online section which would probably increase the games fun tenfold. I highly enjoyed single  player and practising on the courses which progressed from Easy to real difficult. I definitely recommend a purchase though and highly believe in the developers with following through, they are super friendly people and we talk often! We will see in time though! :) I believe in them!Score: Buy Now "

								Is there anything more sublime than a round of minigolf with your buddies? Some of my fondest childhood memories were of birthday parties at the putt-putt course, and even as an adult I sometimes cajole my co-workers into a round or two. Like the name suggests, Golf With Your Friends aims to capture that same simple joy, and does so with admittedly very few frills thus far.At the moment there are three courses to choose from, Forest, Oasis, and Twilight, at 18 holes apiece. Forest hews closest to what you remember of minigolf, with the classic windmill, Plinko drop, and river jump holes. Oasis is an Egyptian-themed course with longer, more elaborate holes that cross over and send the ball flying through the clear desert sky. Twilight is by far the hardest course, with unforgiving ramps and pits that might require half a dozen or more strokes to get just right.Navigating these courses is as easy as click, drag, and release. Your mouse aims your shot and you pull back to fill the four-part power bar, which gives you a wide range of control over the ball. Everything from feather-light taps to line drives are possible, and the holes you encounter will require them all. There's definitely a learning curve to the courses but most of the challenge is in learning just the right finesse to put on the ball to overcome the traps. I was coming close to par on all three courses after a single practice game on each, and I don't consider myself a putt-putt savant.The interface is simple enough to get you into a game almost immediately. Since this golf is intended to be enjoyed with (your) friends, every game is set up as a hosted server. Choosing to join gives you a handy browser with all the filters you could want, and hosting plops you down with name, password, and custom game options. One nice touch is that the lobby itself is a practice hole where you can putt around different obstacles while waiting for the match proper.Admittedly, three courses is not a lot to run with but the custom game options I mentioned give the game plenty more lasting power. You can switch on ball collisions with other players, low gravity mode, optional ball jumping, and even non-spherical balls. Custom games were popular from what I've seen among the thousand or so people playing at any given time, so be prepared for anything when you join a server. The player base seems pretty chill as well and it's always easy to find a match, even if it's not necessarily the course or options I might want at the moment.The graphics are serviceable but nothing spectacular, and the sound design is basic effects under some pleasantly peppy music. Obviously you're going to have more fun if you have the titular Your Friends to play with, but even going in solo there's plenty of fun to be had. Even in its early state, Golf With Your Friends contains enough simple fun to make it worth your time.			"

								Golf With Your Friends is exactly what you would expect from the title: Play some miniature golf!  Invite your friends!The music is relaxing, the sound effects are genuine, and the game has been a light-hearted laugh across voice with friends.  I cannot recall the last time I enjoyed such an innocent experience in a multiplayer game.  It's fantastic and rest assured that the developers are active and working hard to add more features and optimise old ones all the time.Now, I'm writing this during Early Access where there may be bugs and physics issues, but if there are, I have not encountered any of them in my seven hours of play.  That may seem like a small sample size, but it represents twenty or so total full plays across the game's current four courses.

								I recieved this game as a joke gift. Y'know, one of those games that you play with friends because they're bad. After playing it for five minutes we all quickly realized that this game was genuinally fun and brought a lot of laughter.The art style is vibrant and pretty to look at, and the courses are extremely unique and fun to play. There needs to be more music in future updates, as it can be a little maddening, but it is currently in Early Access so that's excusable. It's honestly ridiculous, how a mini golf game can be this fun. I can see myself and my friends playing this consistently whenever it updates. Would highly reconmend to anyone who has a friend to play this with!			"

My friend gifted me this game, and I LOVE IT!!!!DISCLAIMER: THIS GAME IS SUPER DUPER EARLY ACCESSFirst of all, I dislike golfing. But this game...just makes golfing fun. I love this game so much. I think if you are looking for games to buy on Steam, this should be one of them. My favorite part of the game is the water. When you hit your golf ball in the water it has this little raft that connects to it and you can jump all over the place. SUPER FUN. Yet I would love more maps, there are only 3 so far...and it would be fun with more maps. I've already mastered the 3 maps. The bugs in the game don't much bother me, i've only crashed once and I actually have only seen 2 bugs. 1 is a texture bug, a small texture was glitching. I restarted my game and it was fine again. 2 is I've only crashed once.But other than that, the game is super duper fun. BUY IT!Overall rating: 9.5/10 "

								Golf with your Friends is an incredibly fun little game. The courses are creatively designed, challenging, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to play. The game currently has four 18-hole courses with two more expected to be developed before GwyF leaves Early Access. There are plenty of modifiers to increase the replayabilitly, especially when playing with friends, such as ball shape, ball size, gravity, bounciness, and collisions. Playing with the feature to jump the ball at will drastically changes how the courses need to be played.I can't really comment on playing the game solo, since I always play with friends, but it's a blast to play with a group over voice chat. GwyF has a text chat in-game if you cannot voice chat.GwyF is still in Early Access, and as such, has its share of issues. There are various bugs on some of the courses that involve clipping, going out of bounds, or getting stuck, especially when playing with different ball shapes; however, the devs have been keen on making sure those bugs are corrected. The spectator mode needs work. Some of the holes are flat-unplayable with certain ball shapes. It can also be somewhat of a pain to find your friends' lobby since there's no feature to invite from Steam. Most of these issues aren't necessarily game-breaking, and they normally come out to be hilarious and quirky at best, and mildly irritating at worst.All in all, GwyF is well worth its low price. It's simple, well designed, fun, and has a good amount of content, with more on the way.			"

								Essentially this game is as it says, ""Golf With Friends"". After some updates have been made to the game, I can now recommend it. The price-tag isn't all too steep at $6 and for essentially a two-man development team, they have quite progressed since my initial review.Think of it as not ""Golf"" per-say, but Mini-Golf. It has two main areas which are the Forest and Oasis. Both have many holes to play through and they aren't as buggy as when I first started playing.You can do custom settings like higher gravity, different types of balls(easter egg, sphere, isosphere, etc.), and some other misc. settings like collision.Some future maps are coming up, some party games, and some more additional stuff so it's worth investing and supporting the developers in the early stages. There isn't a whole lot of content yet, but a lot is coming.			"

								There are some bugs, but that's what early access is all about right? The devs are very active in fixing errors and advancing the game. Currently it has 2 18-hole courses and they are extremely fun even when you get early-accessed. There are so many game options that it keeps the game entertaining. You can be eggs, cubes, cylinders, etc and you can have super bouncy floors with half gravity. What more could you want besides more courses in the future?Should you get this game? Absolutely!Want to end friendships?Turn on collision and crank up the stroke limit!This game is without a doubt worth every penny you pay for it. Even though it's in early access, it runs very smoothly and it's very popular with a large group of my friends. I can't wait to see what they add to the game next9.5/10			"

Would love to see them add more maps in the future or allow amateurs to create theirs. :)In conclusion, 6 euros well spent !			"

The first game I played, I got completly destroyed by my friends (they played it for a couple of hours before I bought it). With every game that I played I got better and better and even beat my friends and finished first. If you use custom settings, this game can make to rage very hard (I'm looking at you 'Cone'). There are still some features that need to be added and bugs that need to be removed, but it is an early access games so that's only logical. If you have a couple of friends than this is an amazing and fun game.			"

								This is a very quirky fun take on mini-golf that you play with your friends, strangers or even by your lonesome (trying to figure out the hole-in-one strats, you know who you are.) Currently has 2 courses available with more planned on the way, a few quirky modes currently on the experimental version and possibly some of the best devs I've experienced despite only being a 2 man team. They are very active on updates and have a roadmap in the forums if you want to see where they plan on taking it. They are very friendly and active on the forums and is taking community ideas and advice to make the game even better while also adding more to it in a fast enough manner.I highly recommend this to someone who wants a game that is more casual but has the options to make it a stressful race to the hole against others. There are plenty of Youtubers that have videos on it though they might be dated because of the constant tweaks by the devs but you can get an idea of what you'd be getting into from the videos, still though I think it's worth the price in it's current version with only 2 courses so when everything else eventually comes out it'll be more than cost efficient! :)			"

Even in it's current state, it has two very complete and awesome levels, that are extremely unique as far as design goes, and more levels on the way. From my conversations with the devs, they are very open minded about ideas and are constantly working to add new content and various other things.

								Having lots of fun playing this game. It's a great throwback to the flash minigolf games i would spend ages playing as a kid. Very similar to the Gmod towers golf which is also very fun. The holes are a good challenge and are designed very well. The physics/mechanics feel great as well. For 5-6 bucks its a great deal for the 2 current courses. Can not wait till more courses are added and my friends pick up the game! Great work devs!!!			"

								This game is great. There arent alot of good minigolf games you can play with your friends online, and this one is what you want. It is a good time waster with some buddies if youre taking a break from something else and it is also a game you can spend a whole night playing and talking trash with your pals. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE (CURRENT) LACK OF CONTENT AND NEW STUFF IS COMING OUT FREQUENTLY. This game (when finished) will be worth more than 6 dollars so buy it now and watch this game grow into something special.			"

								I bought Golf with friends because it was inexpensive and looked like a great game for relaxing and having a good time and am surprised how fun and vibrant it is! I played through both courses twice with a friend and am still looking forward to hopping on later again because I had a blast! I really love how you can change the golf ball into things like an egg or a cube, and how you can change gravity and bounciness because we had lots of laughs playing with derpy combinations of ball shapes and physics. I liked it so much I bought Golf with friends for two more friends. I'm very much looking forward to new content to come!			"

I give this a 5 outa 5 because I can smoke a joint with one hand and game with the other. The music is upbeat and somehow not annoying. When it cut out I missed it. The holes are huge. Again I assume also like an orgy. So its not hard to sink your balls if you know where Im going with this. Highly recommend this game.			"

								Decent fun, reminiscent of the old top-down mini golf flash games we all played in middle school during computer lab. Graphics look great. Needs some more gameplay options, which I'm sure that the developers are working on. Turn-based would add more pressure to each shot, for example. $6 is more than worth it for the fun you're going to get out of the two 18-hole courses (a forest and an egyptian temple-themed one). Perhaps I'm greedy, but I want more! I'll happily shell out a few more bucks if need be for some DLC courses; just don't get carried away! Awesome little time killer and a game that any kind of friend can enjoy with you. 8/10 as of early access. More modes, possibly more courses as well plz!			"

								1st off going in, dont expect any sort of seriousness. When they added ball shapes: Cube, I knew the devs were pretty funny. But then came the Isosphere. An abomination, The physical form of RNGesus himself. You must offer a sacrifice to win his favor, may it be hitting an opponent off the course, or perhaps your own sanity. Anything goes, might be a simple shot. Until RNGesus says ""Naw bro not feeling it."" And if theres low gravity? Forget ever hoping on getting near the hole. Best indie game ive played for sometime, can't wait to see what else the devs can think of.			"

								Golf with friends is a thrilling adventure in the dynamic genre of competitive mini - golf gaming.  It offers many opportunities to customize the gaming experience such as a dynamic range of ball color selections and endless options for colorful room naming. The in game chat features encourages the play to cheer your opponent on and celebrate great shots in a supportive community environment.  I find it easy to join a public game during times that my friends are unavailable--thus giving me the opportunity to make new friends with whom to share this exhilarating golfing experience.  I cannot recommend this game more highly for those who value beautifully designed games of skill within a fun and relaxing community environment.			"

								Absolutely fun game and an all around chill experience that is a great refresher. Is a fantastic game to play with friends, particularly as a drinking party game. In my opinion, the game is much less enjoyable by yourself and as the title suggests it is meant to be played with others. Granted that the game is in early access, I've run into a solid amount of bugs and complete game crashes. The last hole of the Oasis course is almost completely luck based and needs to be tweaked, but otherwise is a very balanced, relaxed, skill based game.Absolutely worth $5, you won't regret it.			"

Honestly, the 20 minutes I spent playing this game were some of the most fun I've had playing a multiplayer game. It has two very well made levels at this time of development, but is seriously lacking content. As it's early access, I can completely forgive it for that. I really hope that the developers add in new levels soon, or at the least open up a level editor and make a steam workshop section. As soon as they do that, this game will be my favorite multiplayer game.Get this game, and buy a few copies for your friends. You will not regret it.			"

It has it's fair share of bugs, but that's to be expected from an early access game.For a fun time, put on 0.25x gravity and enable jumping. We've dubbed it moon golf.EDIT: The new Haunted House map is amazing, and super refreshing, as hole in one strategies aren't as obvious or readily available. Definitely play it.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game. I think the title alone will help you decide if you'll like it. Do you want to golf with your friends?? Well if that sounds good, you should probably enjoy it. The Level design here has its flaws at times, (mainly with holes that forces you to hit your ball off walls, like the pillars in egypt or the bottle in the mansion) but it is for the most part quite forgiving and interesting. It's great for a large group of friends of all skill levels. The controls themselves are incredibly simple but very well made. Simply click and drag where you want to go and how hard you want to hit it. There's a power bar that easily indicates how hard or soft you'll be hitting. It gets the job done efficiently, and I appreciate that. Surprisingly, it is also got a great amount of replay ability. Coming back to maps you did and turning on jump can really change the entire game. It's broken, but it's fun. And if you really want to make things hectic, you can change the gravity, change the ball shape to all sorts of horrible things (Eggs, cones, stars, cubes, etc) which all completely change how the holes work. Luckily, they're still almost all doable! I really enjoy this game for its simplicity. It's what you'd expect from a mini golf game. I wouldn't recommend it unless you bring a few friends along, however. The single player is nice, but would probably get stale. Only real gripes right now are that I wish there were more levels and possibly a VERY easy to use level editor that lets you pick community levels on the fly (similar to how SpeedRunners does it). Obviously, though, there's more planned for the game, but you can never be sure when it comes to Early Access. Even though there's only a handful of maps, I'd strongly recommend this game with friends, especially since the price is quite affordable as well.			"

								This is one of the greatest games I have played this year. Triumphing over such blockbuster hits like The WItness and Firewatch, this game deserves your attention as well as your hard earned money. Play with friends for extra fun and unforgettable moments of laughter, success, and failure. The only thing wrong with it is its lack of more than 2 courses at the moment.9/10			"

								I've had more time to play now so I can give a more thorough review.TLDR: Amazing game to play with friends at a great low price.Pros:Each course lasts around a half hour, so your games aren't dragged out.Simple controls. All you have to do is hold the left click and pull back the mouse.Runs great on most computersThere's a ton more pros but you guys get the idea.Cons:Not a lot of players. Game came out Janurary 30th and didn't get featured on the front page of Steam, so it might be awhile before the playerbase gets heavier.Only two courses, 18 holes each. They are currently working on some other courses and the potential of a content creator added.Some glitches. Just about all non game breaking.---As you can see there are tons of reasons to by this game, the big one being it's not like other horrible early access games that are just buggy messes. It's $6, definitely worth it.Make sure to check out the subreddit!https://www.reddit.com/r/GolfWithFriendsGame "

								Still one of the few best Indie / early access games out there to play with a full party of 5 or 6 friends. The only problem I have with this game is that you can't ivite friends to a lobby, so your friends have to find your lobby. Other than that this game makes a game of digital mini golf fun despite only having 3 maps so far it's still a good game to purchase, I mean I did purchase 5 copies. What I did durring the Steam Summer Sale. The price even not sale is still worth every cent that you have cause it's a differnet unique game. Oh did I mention you can also have cubes, cones, hockey pucks and more 3D solids than just gold balls.			"

								Totally awesome game for stupidly cheap fun!Graphics: The graphics are not amazing.  Seriously they are basic and offer nothing amazing, but graphics do not make  a game enjoyable and for this game, the graphics are decent enough to not be bothered by!Audio:  The audio again is simple.  It is mini golf but has some kinda annoying music, which you just turn off but for the sound itself it again is nothing enjoyable.  Just basic.Controls: The controls are simple mouse to use, so easy you learn the game on the first few seconds and cannot complain about it at all.Gameplay: The gameplay is mini golf basically... What do you want? You can turn normal minigolf into some insane fun with friends... Up too 12 people might I add and there are several options you can change in the modes options to make the game even more enjoyable, which range from low low gravity, different balls like egg shape, cube shape, cyclinder shape and so on, so mix all these together and you've got a lot of fun going for you!Right now as I write this review, there are only 3 zones and each zone contains roughly 19 holes each.  Sadly, you can do these in under an hour, depending on the settings you have! Still the game is insanely cheap and will be getting a lot of work and more content in the mix and for that, I would highly highly recommend the game!So yes, go and buy! "

That doesn't sound like a ton, but for 6 bucks, I feel that it's a great deal. Get a group of friends to buy this game, and let minigolf madness ensue. I can't reccomend this gem highly enough even at this very early stage, and I can't wait to see what the developers add as the continue the developement process.			"

								Fun game - but a note to the dev's Sometimes the ball gets caught ontop of wood, and it doesnt register that it's stuck.... Outside of that - it needs more maps for sure, a little more on the generic side of flat platforms, but there are some bouncing areas, and ramps which make it fun, and challenging.I can see this being an awesome game for friends, soon as it's bugs are worked out and more implimented into it. I liked it the first time I played it on stream.			"

								I super fun golf game, and let me tell you, if you get like 2-3 of your good friends together and play this, you will have a jolly good time! I absolutely love this game and I've only played an hours worth. The courses offer a bit of difficulty that requires you to time your shots right and use your pro strats. It would be really nice if that added more than 6 levels once it's done because you can play through the levels fairly quickly. The other downside is that the balls appear to ""lag"" when you are spectating and there are also a few spots on different holes where the ball can get stuck and there is no way to get it unstuck.All in all. A really fun game that I would definently recommend buying if you have an extra $6.			"

								Basically, if you've got some friends, you'll probably get the most fun out of this game, even if there's only 2 courses available right now. Theres a few custom options to keep the game interesting, different golf ball shapes, altering gravity, jumping, and how bouncy the ground is, to name a few. If you play with the original options, you most likely won't run into any game breaking bugs, however some of the options when customized, may lead to a few holes that are extremely hard. Runs smooth on an Intel HD 4400 integrated gpu on low, at least, smooth enough for me to be able to enjoy it. If you dont have friends, there's still enough games on around 7-9 pm EST in the NA region, I can't say I've seen the list empty, however I usually get on later in the day to play.			"

I wish there was something to bring me back to this game, but if you played through it once you pretty much saw the entire game. Such a shame.			"

However the real kicker in this title is ""with your friends"" if you've made any up to this point in your life. This game will wish you had. IT is purely a social experienced that is there to kill a bit of time, record something stupid and love every second. There will be disbelief and rage amongst chaos and humor.Golf, well... it's golf. Think putt-putt in a blender. Can be slow on standard, or hectic with different shaped balls or even cubes and that is not mentioning the jumping.Early access. The game holds up well with it's biggest flaw being a lack of content. When I purchased it, there were only three different ""maps"" that housed a full course of 18 holes. To my knowledge now, there is 4 maps. I would say there really need to be a significant jump in content before I call it a completed game.Overall I would vote it a 7/10 for what it is, an early access golf game. To be honest when a mate said buy it I was skeptical. It will serve you well with friends and bore you to death alone and I can't wait for more conent.			"

								The number of levels the developers are making (6) is a little on the low side, I'd prefer to see more holes with their existing themes rather than divert time and resources into new themes and new graphical assets.I'd easily recommend a buy provided the level editor is successfully implemented, as the player base will need to beef up the number of courses there are.

								This game is alot of fun, even more fun when playing it with friends. Graphically, it is impressive, with a lot of nice textures. Gameplay is good, definitely room to improve on some mechanics, but I see a lot of potential for this game. Current content amount is a bit sparse, but more are coming. I am looking forward to seeing a lot more levels and the level editor.

Early Access Review
								At the time of writing, Golf With Your Friends is still in Early Access, but having been on the market since January 30th, I’m pretty comfortable in my assumption that nothing ground-breaking is going to come out of the game, and that it’s at a point where GWYF can be reviewed for the long-term.Golf With Your Friends is one of those stunningly aptly named games that despite its simplicity, still manages to imbue the game with a sense of fun before you even get to playing it. I’m really lucky when it comes to reviewing this game, because the 8-Bit Preppers crew all grabbed a copy one night to play together, and I feel as though that initial session really let GWYF show us exactly what it was all about. There were tears of laughter, no small amount of sledging, and cries of “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t” as we played through the three maps that were available. It was an excellent initial experience, and we have managed to wring a few more sessions out of it by changing the physics options, and by joining public games, but in the end GWYF faces the same dilemma that many early access multiplayers face: Content.In the ten months since its release, Blacklight Interactive has added one extra course to Golf With Your Friends. One. It fills me with disappointment to think of how popular this game could have been upon release if it had more courses, or if more courses were released in a timely manner over the duration of the Early Access period. Like most simple games of skill, GWYF has the potential to be one of those excellent casual games that never gets uninstalled. There are great variations in the four courses that are available at this stage, and I am genuinely interested to see what the next two courses that are scheduled for release in the “full game” will look like. I am, however, pretty sceptical that they will be released before mid 2017, considering the fourth map took so long to release. If Blacklight Interactive really wanted to ensure the longevity of GWYF, release of a level editor with the full game would go a long way towards that.I have to admit that on a fundamental level I still think that releasing games before they are finished is an affront to consumers, but at the same time I can also appreciate its benefits for fledgling Developers like Blacklight Interactive. The good news is that in Golf With Your Friends, they have set very reasonable targets for what is going to be included in the full game. I just wonder if without a level editor or something that adds value and replayability, whether this will just be another casual multiplayer picked up on sale for the majority of consumers. My advice is to plan a game session with your mates, and milk every bit of enjoyment you can from that initial gameplay.			"

								This game is awesome! At first glance I didn't want this game because I don't like golf but playing this game with my friends proved me wrong. This game is fantastic with friends, we've all had hours of fun in this game and it's all from our own stupidity, one friend is a try hard and it's fun trying to beat him and then another friend does crazy random♥♥♥♥♥♥by jumping all over the map and still somehow getting it in.Overall I recommend this game because it's an awesome game to chill with and just to calm down after cancerous games of dota/similar games.9/10Not 10/10 because the maps do get boring over time but I know the devs are working on a new map ATM and they're creating a map editor for people to use.My friend did buy this game for me but it's so good i'd buy it again just to support the devs.			"

								Well, I bought this game thinking, ""Hmmmm, online mini golf for 6 bucks? Not a bad deal."" Ohhhhh what a mistake that was. This game has driven me to insanity, who knew a game of mini golf could make you want to hurt someone who lives across the planet and give you PTSD every time you try and eat an ice cream CONE. Stupid cone. When all the modifiers are off, the game can be enjoyable, but when they're on all hell breaks loose. I know it's in alpha but the game is quite buggy, this will hopefully be worked out. I tried to get a refund, but Steam said 3 hours was TOO much gameplay, so I guess I'm stuck getting infuriated by cones and collisions with other players.			"

								Tl;DR: Buy it. Pros- Fun and balanced gameplay, perfect mix of everything- Playing against friends is great and rage inducing- Textures look great and it runs well- Active mods who are open to hearing about ideas and bugs- Good course design- Modifiers add a new twist to the game that can be niceCons - Only 2 courses. More to come soon so not really a con.- Music isn't fitting on the Oasis course, is apparently getting changed soon- Chat is in upper case only which isn't that big of a dealOverall It is an above average game. It was only $6.50CAD which is a steal at the moment. Friends and I have over 10 hours each and the game isn't even halfway made yet. With a possible level editor coming this game is a must buy for any steam user. Rating based on price: 9.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								For an early access game, with little to no content... I have never had so much fun playing a video game in YEARS now, Golf with Friends is easily the funnest thing I have ever done.The game itself is extremely well polished for early access, if they didn't say on the store page, they could have easily sold this as a full release and nobody would question it, even with only two courses (18 holes each) it's so well done.The music is very happy sounding, and quite addicting, it repeats on a loop basically forever... But you don't even notice it, even on a loop it's just that fitting to the game.  I could listen to this on a daily basis and still love it.The physics of the game are almost flawless, with a little skill you can predict exactly where the ball will go, and sink that hole in one every time.The courses, for there only being two... Are beautifully designed, with the classics such as windmills... All the way to being eaten by a sphinx, going throughout it's body, and being launched out into a temple of doom.You've also got loops, half pipes, bouncing platforms that launch your ball all over, bank shots off pillars, running along the walls, fake holes that launch you off the course. They've got it all!It's a lot of fun playing singleplayer, sadly there are no AI so you're all alone, but it's decent fun.But once you add even a single friend to the game... Oh boy, get ready for one hell of a time! The more you add, the more fun it is.  Exponentially more fun, when on Skype or other method of talking to your other players.The dev team for this game is very small, only two people, but they are extremely active in the community discussions, taking suggestions, helping with issues, and are just providing an outstanding experience for their users. 10/10 game, 15/10 devs.			"

I am hoping at some point they add a leveling system so you can unlock new things as you play(Such as ball patterns, hats or trails). There are only 2 maps right now but I am so excited to see the new ones coming out in the future. I check their forums almost daily to check to see whats to come and what is in all of  the recent updates.. Overall would totally reccommend to pretty much anyone.			"

I am looking forward to seeing how the game progresses from here.			"

								You wouldn't expect a person who plays GTA V constantly to like an indie mini golf game but I believe it holds a lot of potential. This game is super early access and only has 2 courses but playing with your friends is such a great and competitive time.Some people might argue and say that it's super limited and gets boring and they're right, about the first part. But I don't think it ever gets boring! Playing the same courses over and over again offers more fun because of the Online factor. You never know what's going to happen differently when you replay it with friends.That's why I'd recommend this game to anyone.			"

								It's minigolf. Not that hard to do, really. You probably already knew that from the title of the game.It's currently in early access (Feb. 23, 2016) so there's not a whole lot of everything yet, but what's there now is polished and fun. More courses are promised, along with a level creator, so there should be tons of replayability in the future.Also, the devs are super active in responding to community feedback. Moreso than I've seen for most indie developers, or game devs in general. They are extremely passionate about their game and don't want anyone to be left out due to a small glitch that doesn't allow them to play.If you don't like minigolf, though, there's nothing here for you. If you don't like minigolf, however, chances are you would not be reading reviews for a minigolf game.I'd rate it8/10Get it now before, the price goes up (if it ever does) later in development, and also to support the devs to finish this. I might rate higher if/when new content is released and is subsequently good.			"

								In it's Early Access state it's a great game for short intervals. Especially if you have friends that don't like the same genre as you do - because everybody knows how to play and enjoys some virtual golf. And if you want it to become crazy fun, just enable ball-jumping and bouncy underground in ""Custom"" mode and let everybody get creative with their snipes and slam dunks. xD Maybe even add low gravity to the mix. Or play legit minigolf physics in ""Classic"" mode. All of that you can do in the Early Access build and the two maps are really rich with basic but very diverse courses in two clearly divided difficulty levels where Forest is ""Easy"" and Oasis is ""Advanced"". And don't fear 12 player games, you can turn player collision off if you so desire.			"

Now that's a fun golf game. In this game, yes, you play golf with (Big Surprise) your friends. And yes, you can play an average game. But why not spice up the settings? Why not play golf with eggs? Why not turn jump on and watch golf balls jump around the course? Why not both? This game is honestly fun with some good friends, and can make some good laughs.Over all? 7/10 (With some friends)			"

								Golf with friends is easily one of the most fun games I've played in a while. It's just pure and simple fun.At the moment, there are only two courses, the Forest (self explanatory) and Oasis, which is an egyptian themed course. The lack of other courses hasn't turned me off from the game, however. The levels are very repeatable and fun, and it's always interesting to try to find inventive ways to get a better score on a certain hole. In the future they will be adding more courses, so if the lack of courses is a turn off for you, it will soon be fixed. One thing I would really like to see in this game is a course creator, so that the community can make their own courses. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's great, simple fun and for only $6, that's an awesome deal.			"

And don't fear 12 player games, you can turn player collision off if you so desire.			"

All I would ask for is Steam Workshop support for custom maps as there are only 2 maps as of this review.Really excited to see how this game develops over time!

								I wasn't sure if this was going to be terrible but my friends had it so I decided to download it. I thought it was going to just sit in my library but it is extremely fun, I've played it tons with my friends and I will keep on playing. The game does currently lack content but they are putting out constant updates with new maps and things to do. You can also invite freinds to the lobby now instead of scrolling through the server browser. I feel that the game will get boring soon but I'm loving it and if you have a group of friends to play it with, its definitely worth the money. (especially since its really cheap)			"

								This game tailors to anyone looking to have a good time with some buds. Although it may come across as a relaxing and casual game, tempers run high and the inner perfectionist in all of us comes out. There is no one way to putt each hole as there are many obstacles that can be interpreted differently. 9/10 will continue to play. Not 10/10 because an invisible wall stopped me from getting an eagle :')			"

								Golf with friends is easily one of the most fun games I've played in a while. It's just pure and simple fun.At the moment, there are only two courses, the Forest (self explanatory) and Oasis, which is an egyptian themed course. The lack of other courses hasn't turned me off from the game, however. The levels are very repeatable and fun, and it's always interesting to try to find inventive ways to get a better score on a certain hole. In the future they will be adding more courses, so if the lack of courses is a turn off for you, it will soon be fixed. One thing I would really like to see in this game is a course creator, so that the community can make their own courses. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's great, simple fun and for only $6, that's an awesome deal.			"

Give them a couple of months and this game will run really smooth and have a lot more content, I'd recomened playing with friends as it states in the games name. But if you have no friends I still suggest buying it. for it being in early access and not having much content, I give it a 7/10.			"

								Extremely solid early acess game.As of this review there are only two courses but they are interesting enough and hard enough to play multiple times over; especially in multiplayer, which as the name would suggest, is where this game shines. What is here is good, and gives promise for the added content that will come with time. Not much more you could ask for with a early access game. If you like mini golf games, this is a good one, better than most and likely better than the others when it gets to 1.0.Unfortunate title though in my opinion but at least it is fitting given how easy it is to get a online match up and running.

The game has right amount of skill and luck, and the holes are fun and exciting(Except hole 18 on Oasis). The game is pretty janky in some places but I'm hopeful that will be ironed out when It hits its full release.

								Golf with Friends is truly a stress inducing game, but well worth your $6. No one likes to scream at a golf ball alone, so best bring your friends! You’ll all be screaming because there's nothing like a good game of golf to bring the community together. 10/10 would putt harder, better, faster, stronger.			"

								It's Mini Putt with a physics engine. You'll want to ace every hole on Forest and curse the gods for your bad fortune on Oasis. Early access means your friends will love you for getting them into it and hate you for finding it first until they OCD the courses for themselves.			"

								best golf game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love that there is no random power meter like every other golf game. here you get to pick how hard you want to hit the ball.  the game is so good that i bought 3 more copies for my friends. pros:- no random power meter.- graphics are good.- really really fun to play - you know its good when you have 35+ hours in 3 weeks.- really fast load times.- you can make your ball glow.cons:-music only one song. not that they need music.  since i play with my friends all the time i would jsut turn it off anyways because of voice chat.- there are a few issues with the oasis course. but all in all its good. bottom line if you don't have the game already you need it. what are you waiting for buy it now. the developers  respond to feedback all the time on the forms. this is one of the good EA games on steam. and to think only 2 ppl are developing this game. keep up the great quality of the game please.

								This is really a fun game. Due to it being early access at the moment, you might have a limited experience, but fun none the less. It's a fantastic game to play with your friends (I suggest being on voice comms with them, it's really funny).I feel that I can't explain it better than ""it's good fun"", so here's a list of good and lacking aspects of this game that I have come across in my 7 hours of playtime:Good:- Very easy to pick up and play.  Within 30 minutes of starting the game I was already able to play on a decent competitive level against others.- The controls are wonderful. Feels very smooth when you play it and it doesn't take long for you to master the ways of the putt-putt.- Stimulating/satisfying gameplay; this is the kind of game I just love to play while watching a movie or YouTube on my second monitor.- Playing together with friends is alot of fun and depending on how you customize the game rules, you can get some proper Mario Kart-esque competitive fun.Lacking:- As of posting this, there are only 2 maps; Forest and Oasis. There is a big shift in difficulty between the two. Forest is very easy and the pars/hole-in-ones can be memorized within an hour, while Oasis is very tricky and requires alot of good timing. This will no doubt be no issue once more maps have been added.- I have experienced a few weird occurrences regarding the physics of the game. Sometimes when you hit a wall straight on, your ball can bounce away at an angle. Sometimes you can suddenly go off a jump and go way higher than you usually do.- The server browser is probably the worst thing right now, as you cannot sort the listings in any way, and you have to painstakingly check if the server is in the Lobby and has no password requirements. A way to sort the server list and filter out password requiring servers would be awesome.Note: Even though there are these lacking aspects of the game, the good aspects override them most of the time.All in all, I'd say this game guarantees at least 3 hours of fun, and much more if you can get a few friends to play with.

								Well, I bought this game thinking, ""Hmmmm, online mini golf for 6 bucks? Not a bad deal."" Ohhhhh what a mistake that was. This game has driven me to insanity, who knew a game of mini golf could make you want to hurt someone who lives across the planet and give you PTSD every time you try and eat an ice cream CONE. Stupid cone. When all the modifiers are off, the game can be enjoyable, but when they're on all hell breaks loose. I know it's in alpha but the game is quite buggy, this will hopefully be worked out. I tried to get a refund, but Steam said 3 hours was TOO much gameplay, so I guess I'm stuck getting infuriated by cones and collisions with other players.			"

								best golf game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love that there is no random power meter like every other golf game. here you get to pick how hard you want to hit the ball.  the game is so good that i bought 3 more copies for my friends. pros:- no random power meter.- graphics are good.- really really fun to play - you know its good when you have 35+ hours in 3 weeks.- really fast load times.- you can make your ball glow.cons:-music only one song. not that they need music.  since i play with my friends all the time i would jsut turn it off anyways because of voice chat.- there are a few issues with the oasis course. but all in all its good. bottom line if you don't have the game already you need it. what are you waiting for buy it now. the developers  respond to feedback all the time on the forms. this is one of the good EA games on steam. and to think only 2 ppl are developing this game. keep up the great quality of the game please.

								This game is awesome! At first glance I didn't want this game because I don't like golf but playing this game with my friends proved me wrong. This game is fantastic with friends, we've all had hours of fun in this game and it's all from our own stupidity, one friend is a try hard and it's fun trying to beat him and then another friend does crazy random♥♥♥♥♥♥by jumping all over the map and still somehow getting it in.Overall I recommend this game because it's an awesome game to chill with and just to calm down after cancerous games of dota/similar games.9/10Not 10/10 because the maps do get boring over time but I know the devs are working on a new map ATM and they're creating a map editor for people to use.My friend did buy this game for me but it's so good i'd buy it again just to support the devs.			"

								More like Trigger With Your Friends! This is a surprisingly fun minigolf game for up to 12 players, across three levels 18 holes each (at the time of writing this review), so there's a lot of minigolf to be had. It gets really tricky and fun when the host enables the ball jump, which means you can cut through holes in creative ways.Friendship is over when the host enables solid ball mode - you can knock your friend away back to square one if you're lucky.Also, all 12 players play the same hole at the same time, which speeds things up considerably.Although the game is in Early Access, all the important parts are working. Ball physics can be a little bit wonky when the players interact with each other, but it's still loads of fun.			"

								Really fun game, I specially enjoy that you can customize each game with different options such as jumping, different ball shapes etc. One thing that I would love for the game developer to change in future patches, would be that there was an option (or make it default) for players to make every stroke hit before the timer runs out count. Let all balls finish rolling before you change to the next map. I have noticed that on multiplayer the timer isn't always 100% in sync between players, some players being able to hit strokers that seemed like they should have definetly been out of time on my end. All of my friends who have played the game agree with this. Despite this minor request, the game is cheap and definetly worth it. I'm looking forward to future updates and maps!			"

								""Hey, guys, we fixed the physics!"" -- Not the phrase I would use. I was on the second hole of Oasis, and my ball stopped on the side of the bowl and just started this slow slide down towards the centre, turning what SHOULD have been a hole in one into a four-stroke before I retired from the match. This doesn't even get into the fact that my jumps are STILL not registering in parts of the Forest. I get that this is early access, and that we should expect bugs, but it seems like every patch that's being put out either breaks MORE stuff, or there's absolutely no change. It would be great if these little wrinkles are ironed out before full-release, but it seems like every ""fix"" just causes more problems than leaving it alone in the first place.Overall, it's a great game (Don't turn on collision, unless you want to cost yourself a friend or five). I'm still going to play it; please don't think otherwise. But this latest ""patch"" has more holes than Swiss Cheese.			"

								My friends and I have been looking for a good mini-golf game that is on par with Gmod Towers. This is finally the answer to our search. While this is early access, the current feature set, graphics, customization, and maps provide a very promising game. Very few glitches were encountered and the gameplay is smooth. Hosting a game and getting started was fast. I look forward to the level customization and steam workshop integration. If they achieve this feature, it will make this game well worth the price. Positives: - Well optimized game- Smooth gameplay and nice graphics- The 2 levels included were well designed- Private games- Customizable games ( low grav, ball types, etc)Negatives:- Early Access (Not feature complete)- No level editor/steam workshop yet.

								I love Golf With Your Friends. Despite being in Early Access this game is well put together and fun. As of June 1 there are only three maps, but you can customise the game rules to change it up.. for better or for worse. You might destroy your friendships if you pick any of the hilariously frustrating options.10/10			"

								I had a chance to play this game with my friend. He is my nephew. We played all the courses.  We had a lot of fun playing the game. We didnt have any disconnects. We didnt have any issues with the ball physics. We both played on laptops. He owns a AMD system and I have a Intel system. I turned off AA as it kills the frames per second. With AA I was getting under 30. Without I am at a steady 30fps. I am playing on a i3 5005u. This is still in EA so its still a little rough. The most glaring issue is no overhead view of the golf course your playing on. So sometimes your not sure where to hit the ball. I wouldnt mind a quick flyover the hole. Their is a free cam. You can bring this up with the C button.  I should mention that their is no controller support at this time. Their is no playing on the same screen side by side. Its online only for now.  I know they are going to add controller support eventually. So its mouse right now. I really liked the graphics. The sounds were good. The golf courses I found all of them to be fun.  Overall if you have a friend and want to play a game with him/her this would be a great choice. If you dont have friends then your going to have to try and get somone to play with you. The game is a lot of fun for the low price.			"

								Just get the game. Buy it. Right now. Just do it.This game is just amazing. I love it so very much, except there is one problem. I have no friends. Just Kidding. Well anyway, back to the review. You might think that you would easily get bored playing the same two courses over and over again, but no, there are customization options. There are so many combinations of custom options, such as jumping, low gravity, and even different shapes for balls. Many of these will majorly change the game. Even if you don't have friends, you can still host your own game and play by yourself. It also has a nice sound track.For an early access game, it is incredible. 10/10 Would hole in one then stole out on the next hole again.			"

								This is one of the best games ever. I own top games such as tomb raider, gta 5 and most of the cod games and this game gets equavalent or more of my attention than those games do. I've only had this game for a week but it is da sh*t. I play this game all the time with a baller named Mr. Cool Cat Nips, I know, that is a baller name. I mean it has the word nip in it. However, getting back on topic this game is for the ballers. I will say it once and only once, you have to be gay to not like this game. Not the happy version but the other. Trust me, there are only two flaws with this game, there are no zombies and there is no controller suppoprt. You will live, breath and eventually die playing this game. You will more than likely cut yourself from getting ticked off at the game for missing a shot. Great Game and you better buy. Pu*syslayer69 would play this game. Are you a pu*sy slayer?			"

			Views: 90

Great mini-golf game.  Early Access is more about lack of content than stability.  My friend and I hit one bad bug in the time we played, but other than that the game is pretty solid.Right now the biggest draw back is that there are only two maps and only one mode (as of Jan 30th 2016), but as long as more content comes in this is shaping up to be an amazing minigolf game.The netcode seems to work without a hitch, but that might be more because that everyone plays their turn asynchronously without having to wait for anyone else.  So 8 player games will go just as fast as a 2-player game, skillset obviously affecting the time.My favorite golf games are Kirby's Dream Course and Tee It Up (XBLA) so I've always favored a more arcade type golf experience.Very interested to see what type of modes open up as the game progresses, like power-ups etc. Pros:+Pretty Stable for an *alpha* game+Online Multiplayer works great+Games are fast without much waiting+Auto Spectate after you've finished your hole+Level design for the first two maps are very coolCons:-Limited amount of content (which should be fixed provided that more maps and modes come)			"

I have to say that the music is the stuff of the devil, and if I play it backwards I am sure I can summon Lucifer to murder me. No friends were included with this game, and as such am disappointed. I don't know if they will be released as DLC or whether they come in a separate game?Highly Recommend 10/10			"

It truly makes me feel like i'm living a fufulled life when i click 'Play Game'. One thing thats always ruined this game is it's lack of any story, you simply hit balls around with your friends. Another problem is the horrible character development. I personally feel the black community is horribly underrepresented aswell with the only black characters being a black and brown ball. Overall i'd give it a solid 5/7.			"

								RAGE!!! This game is full of it. But that's what makes it so fun! Sure there are several holes that are annoying and sometimes impossible. And that's a bit frustrating, but it's still really fun. Collisions with other players can be a bit annoying when your ball just randomly bounces back after you put into an open area. And hitbox issues on walls that cause your ball to bounce off-target. This game could use several updates to holes; higher walls for example.Overall, this is a fun game. At least for a few rounds.

								As a half black half asian golf professional who cheats on his wife regularly - I KNOW GOLF. This my friends is the ultimate expression of what the game of golf was always meant to be, in video game form. You will be taken to heaven in the luscious scenery of the ""Forest"" before falling to hell in the contradictory-named ""Oasis"". This game has been tailored for all the masochistic professional golfers of the world to devote their last bits of sanity to the glory of perfection. Also well suited for the beginner golfer setting out on his long journey from pallet town to collect all 8 gym badges and finally catch them all. There will be unprecidented adventures on an exploration of the Kanto region where you will meet friends and foes alike, on your way to finally realizing your dream of becomming a pokemon master.

								5 dollars for about 20 hours of gameplay. after 20 hours you will have every hole in one memorized and it won't really be fun anymore. the 3 maps are great but they get boring after you've played them each twice or three times. as for right now, all my friends think the game was a waste because it got boring so quick with just 3 maps. if the devs would just work hard on a map editor, this game would sell like hot cakes and so many people would play it. it would be like track mania except the devs would be swimming in money. as for right now it's okay to play but i've already played it out and i'm bored of it. i recommend it only if you think mini golf is fun and you have friends to play it with.

								I am enjoying this game! Definitely does need to be played with friends, though. Much sillier, especially with bounce and collision enabled. I will admit I started playing it because I saw YouTubers playing it.It does require an easier way to find your friends' game in the server list, but hopefully that will be added in development. It doesn't seem quite done yet, and has a few bugs, but the developer does seem very attentive on the forum.Only three courses at the moment, but a variety of amusing ways to mess with physics adds some replayability. Won't keep you entertained forever, but a fun thing to do for a round or two.			"

								This is going to be a short review because I haven't played Golf WIth Friends a lot yet, but I really wanted to suggest something. This game seems really promising and when I was playing it the time just flew by and I was having a lot of fun playing with friends. The levels so far are not boring; each one is a new exciting challenge. The graphics are nice to look at also. The one thing I wanted to suggest is that I was thinking about playing this with family such as my little sister or grandpa, but if I want him to join a game he would have to read through all of the game names, and a lot are inapropriate. If there was a way that I could just invite someone directly that would be nice, or a setting that toggles a profanity filter would also be nice. Hopefully this gets added.			"

								Although I ran into a few weird OB issues where my ball wouldn't get reset, I had a great time playing this with some friends today (went through both courses twice with 3 and 4 players). Some classic holes mixed in with some truly devious ones! Those will have your under par score decimated in the blink of an eye! Nice visuals, and I like that you can look around and see the rest of the course from your current vantage point. Can't wait to see what else gets added. Wonderful start!			"

								The green flags of an Early Access game are usually the core gameplay mechanics and the developers track record. As it stands now, controls for this game are ergonomic and pleasurable to use. There are 4 levels and they are each pretty well constructed to mimic the idiosyncrasies of real life mini-golf. The lobby/multiplayer system is already in place, so you can (as the title says) Golf with your Friends!The developers are 3 guys based out of Australia with no prior track record. They have been promising so far with updates and addressing user concerns (via forums, emails, or Discord), but I always err on the side of caution since the income from an Early Access game can sometimes alter agendas; this is especially true for developers that have no investors and haven't had that sort of money before. Verdict: the game is great fun. You won't save much by waiting for it to go on sale. Potentially be ready for the developers to have a change of heart.			"

								Pros- Dont need friends to play- Can make friends while playing- Cheap and fun- Takes no time to download- Doesnt need anything special to run smoothly- Nice physicsCons- Spectation of others is messed up- No way to kick absent players (no fun with time limit of 5 mins per hole)- When you get cone on low gravity high bounciness and rip out your pubesUnsure- When you click quit game it crashes. Doesn't really matter because you already want out, and can click cancel when windows searches for a 'solution.'Overall worth $6, especially if you are wondering what to spend the refund from No Man's Sky on. This is one of those games. 9/10 as if that matters, and this is still really early access. Can't wait to see all the updates (which btw, the devs seem active and working hard on improvements. By no means something you will have to wait a year before its playable.)Plus Jack, Mark, Bob, and Wade played it, and their reactions are pretty accurate.

								This game can be fun if you're alone - there is online multiplayer and even playing through the courses solo can be a blast. However, this game truly shines when it comes to - as the name suggests - playing local with your friends! The first time is a collective confusion of ""Where is the hole?"" which later devolves into a havoc of putting and flying! The additional settings can really spice up a game - frustration and laughter alike! Basically, if you can arrange for you and a couple of friends to all get this game together, I assure you it'll be worth every penny.			"

								Golf With Your Friends is quite bare bones at the moment, but what it lacks in features it makes up for in fun. Now, I can't speak for how it plays with strangers, however this is a great casual golf game to play with your friend(s) - as the title alludes to. Considering the content (or lack of), the price point is suitable (and perhaps even surprising at times). With three courses currently implemented, things can seem repetitive, though the ability to turn on modifiers ensures replayability.Despite the occasional frame drops, the game looks nice. There is also a fair amount of desync, but for now it's nothing that isn't to be expected given its Early Access state. Of course, one would hope for improvement in both the aforementioned areas as development progresses.A title hard to pass up at such a low price, so long as you have friends.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I would highly reccommend this game to anyone. This game is some of the most fun you can have in multiplayer games. You can also play singleplayer, but if you want to have fun, you really need a bunch of friends playing it with you. I would give this game a solid 9/10 on enjoyment. I can't judge how the game is built too much since it's currently only in version .096, a long while until fully complete. Visuals - 8/10A game doesn't have to be good to have good graphics. This game has graphics that are good enough. Looking at some games that run at 1080p 60fps for me such as some table pool ones, look fine, but don't fit the game. The graphics just don't fit the mood of the music or the game your actually playing. On Golf With Your Friends though, the graphics fit the game. The graphics go well with the music as well. The graphics don't cause the game to slowdown, even with my meh computer. I wouldn't change anything about how this game looks if I could.Music - 7/10Some of the tracks in this game can get a bit repetitive, but they are still pretty decent. The music fits great with not only the graphics, but the mood you'll be in while playing this game: happy. I'm going to end the music section quick just to save time, not too much to say about it.Singleplayer - 5/10I don't give this game a very high score for singleplayer. The game is still fun, but not nearly as fun as if you were playing with a bunch of friends. If you do have friends but they don't feel like playing at that moment, you can go mess around with 50 shots and level retries trying to find ways to get holes in ones though, and the courses alone are entertaining.Multiplayer - 9.5/10I think this game has a potential to make a 10/10 in this area, but again, it's not complete yet. Sitting down with my friends playing this game is one of my favorite things to do. Me and my friends even named each score (Hole in one, birdie, bogie, etc.) after Garfield characters, even calling running out of shots/time a ""burnt lasagna"". The amount of laughs I've gotten out of my friends failing, or just the tention of a friend being on the last level when you don't know who's going to win. Replay Value - 8/10This game has a lot of customizable features in the custom game settings. If you want, you can make the ball into an egg or a cube, you can turn on low gravity, high bounce, jumping, etc. You can customize your ball color if you want, but not that exciting. The devs have said that they plan to add minigames in the future. One suggestion someone had was that you would have to get the ball somewhere while in a pinball machine, or into a basketball hoop, which sounds amazingly fun. The dev commented on this idea saying he might impliment it, so you can already see that the creators are listening.Overall - 9/10 (for now)This indie game is amazingly fun, and I hope that all of you reading this review buy it right now and play it with some friends. There is a lot of hope for this game, and I can't wait  to see it thrive forward. This game is 100% worth the 6 dollars I payed for it, and I would probably but this game if it was 30 or 40 dollars, it is an amazing game, that again, I would reccomend to anyone. - Coddlington (me) "

								I have never played this game as a straight up, real life mini golf experience. I think the game is meant to be played with low grav, bouncy ground, and especially with random ball shapes. I think you're missing out if you do not frustrate yourself and your friends to the point of friendship-ending rage that comes with this game. Conceptually, it's genius. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to put a cone on a mini golf course, but it makes for an interesting game. As of right now, there are only three maps. But the game is still in early access, and I can forgive that because of the replay value that comes with this game, especially in multiplayer. There are so many ways to customize games that each game could have an entirely different spin.The lobbies are pretty annoying as of right now. You can't search a lobby name, so you have to flip through pages. Right now, that's not a huge problem since there are maybe 30 pages at max at any given time, but when this game becomes more popular, that's not gonna fly. Also, when typing in a password, you have to erase the word password before typing. It's something small but incredibly annoying after the first four or five times you do it. The option to create a lobby through Steam would be nice.I think the music kind of sucks, which is a little disappointing but not a dealbreaker. There is, however, one game-breaking bug I've encountered a few times where your golf ball begins to jump in place on its own without stopping. Sometimes it will stop when the turn is over, but sometimes it will just keep jumping forever and the only thing you can do to stop it is end the game. However, this is still an early access game and I've heard the developers are already on top of it.Overall, it's a great game, it's hilarious, and the bugs are being worked out. I highly recommend it.			"

								Golf With Your Friends is a great mini-golf game, it may still be in very early access, but is still a lot of fun and would highly reccomend it to any and all players that like mini-golf.- Has a lot of gimmicks to make the game challenging, creative, and interesting.- Has three courses; Forest, Oasis, and Twilight, with a fourth and possibly more coming on its way.- Includes two game modes, Classic and Custom, which you can choose between depending on your style of play    - Classic is your basic style of mini-golf, you use your power and angle to get in the hole with the lowest score.    - Custom you can choose between a lot of different features, such as Ball Shape, Gravity, Bouncy Ground, Jumping, and a few others to make the game even crazier for the creative of golfers and to those who want to spice up a round of golf to balance the skill between experienced and inexperienced players.- One downside as of right now is that sometimes it can be a little hard to try and find the match your trying to join, but I'm sure the devs will put something in to make that easier at some point.

Often times i had no idea wich way to the pin.Other than that, just needs more content ;) (3 areas at the time i played with 18 holes each, still plenty for now)  -Feels Solid  -Great Graphics  -Exactly what i had in mind when looking for a Mini Golf game.

								I have noticed that there has been multiple collision detection problems since the recent update and it is not specified to certain maps or gamemodes it just seems to be universal throughout the game.

								I played the oasis course tonight and even when the ball stops after hitting it, it still moves on its own. With the timer it took 30 seconds for the ball to move a full square and it still moves when trying to aim. This wasn't happening before the update. This is still fun to play though by yourself or with friends.			"

								Okay, so let me just begin with how amazing this game is, I only got it on Saturday, June 4th, and I can't stop playing it, it is the best raging game to play with your noisy friends who like to create a commotion, and the best part is, it will never getting boring because they are adding new things into the game practically every week! I reccomend this game because it's a great time for you and your friends to have fun together and compete in a serious / not-so serious game, you've earned my respect ""Golf With Your Friends""			"

								At first I thought the game was just a traditional golfing game where there added a multiplayer mode to it but I was wrong that game is really fun to play with some friends like the name would suggest.So it is any good ?Disclaimer!The game being still in alpha at the time this review will maybe not be still relavent when the game will reach gold but it deserve a critic or two.The general idea :So the game takes place on one of a few golfing courses ,with all a different themes and mechanics, those golfing course are :-Forest-Oasis-Twilight-Haunted-CandylandAll the golfing courses has 18 holes ,each holes can be completed in multiple ways which it gives some replay value and a notion of experimenting in each playthrough .No Caption ProvidedMore in detail :You can customize your ball in which ever color you want.Create and join public or private lobby.Final thoughts :There is no much to say about this game because its still in developpement. The game is really fun for a Sunday afternoon with a group of friends online ,don't expect more from this title, it’s shame the game has not yet an editor it would give the game more replay value and would really bring more people to it and by consequence create a community around this fun indy game.

								This game can be fun if you're alone - there is online multiplayer and even playing through the courses solo can be a blast. However, this game truly shines when it comes to - as the name suggests - playing local with your friends! The first time is a collective confusion of ""Where is the hole?"" which later devolves into a havoc of putting and flying! The additional settings can really spice up a game - frustration and laughter alike! Basically, if you can arrange for you and a couple of friends to all get this game together, I assure you it'll be worth every penny.			"

								The best mini-golf experience money can buy.Pros:Multiple courses, All unique and vary in difficultyGreat physics (semi customizable)Custom set rules/settings (max shots per hole, ball shape, size, color, ""jump"" option, gravity, it goes on...The settings gives it a lot of replayability You'll never have so much fun getting frustrated with your friendsCons:Some extreme settings can make some holes impossible. (putting a cone a few places in candyland LOL) Very few ramps/runways/general ground areas don't match up perfectly which results in little bumps to crazy physics bugs. I really have nothing bad to say about this game at all, and as soon as the game starts it gives you a warning that the game is in alpha, there are bugs, it is what it is. It's not as bad as the warning makes it seem, in my opinion. The first ""Con"" is really on you, not the game. When you change gravity, use weird shapes, and have to jump a slightly bumpy spiral ramp, and can't make it... welll... duh. lol. The second is totally understandable, it's in alpha, and they are so far and few, it's just another thing for you and your friends to laugh and cry about, just adding to the overall experience. 100% Worth it.

								This game is so much fun. It kept me and my other buds content for like a good solid 3 hours. The only bad thing that I have to say about it that is problem is when you have to put a good amount of effort into planning when your going to do it with your friends. It's not a simple hit play and have fun. Still though, that's not something that the developers can really solve and it is still an amazing game non the less. I did a let's play of this game. It would make my day if you guys could check it out and tell me what you think. I'll put a link to it below. Have a wonderful day.

								Just bought this today for my friend and myself, and we played through each of the maps once, and already we can tell this is going to be a great game! I only have 1 issue with this game at present, and that's with the lack of mouse inversion, but given it's very early access, I totally understand not everything will be even close to perfect yet. (I've read this is being planned for future builds, so I can wait.)Paying under $5 for this at such an early stage, while being actively developed is worth every cent. The fact that it's as fun as it is in its current form, means I have zero regrets in purchasing! I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs yet or anything. It runs smooth at 2160p, and it had my friend and I laughting our asses off at many elements. (The little floaties on the ball.. LOL!) I rarely review games after only playing through for such a short amount of time, but I can't help myself with this one! I would happily encourage people to buy, as doing so will no doubt allow the dev to make this even better than it already is!Was fantastic to see an Australian region option already too! Much more fun than I've had with a lot of other mini golf games. Challenging and creative holes, and while there are only 3 levels at present, they each have 18 holes, so there's plenty with which to have fun! I can see my friend and I playing a lot more of this, especially if the dev continues to integrate suggestions made by players!			"

								I am enjoying this game! Definitely does need to be played with friends, though. Much sillier, especially with bounce and collision enabled. I will admit I started playing it because I saw YouTubers playing it.It does require an easier way to find your friends' game in the server list, but hopefully that will be added in development. It doesn't seem quite done yet, and has a few bugs, but the developer does seem very attentive on the forum.Only three courses at the moment, but a variety of amusing ways to mess with physics adds some replayability. Won't keep you entertained forever, but a fun thing to do for a round or two.			"

								5 dollars for about 20 hours of gameplay. after 20 hours you will have every hole in one memorized and it won't really be fun anymore. the 3 maps are great but they get boring after you've played them each twice or three times. as for right now, all my friends think the game was a waste because it got boring so quick with just 3 maps. if the devs would just work hard on a map editor, this game would sell like hot cakes and so many people would play it. it would be like track mania except the devs would be swimming in money. as for right now it's okay to play but i've already played it out and i'm bored of it. i recommend it only if you think mini golf is fun and you have friends to play it with.

								Golf With Your Friends is an early access game first, and a golfing game second. It's always important to remember what you're getting with your games, and whether or not they're finished, and whether or not you're okay with an incomplete game. For the purpose of full disclosure, I'll be noting that I received this from a Humble Bundle that was gifted to me by a friend. I've put a couple of hours into GWYF now in various public lobbies, and I'll be playing with actual friends at some point soon now that I have a hang of the controls. This plays like a standard crazy golf game, with three courses of 18 holes each featuring insane and outlandish obstacles and physics conundrums to overcome. The courses are entertaining, though they can get somewhat repetitive in public lobbies, as once you have played one of the three enough times, you'll have learned how to perfectly shoot that hole consistently. There are three courses to select from, in what I would say to be a rising difficulty level of Forest - Twilight - Oasis. Apparently a fourth course is being made, Haunted Mansion. For the most part each hole poses its own unique, fair, but fun challenge, but some of the holes feel like a bit of a crapshoot, and on more than a few holes, glitches are present that make it impossible to complete the hole. For example, there is one hole in Twilight in which you float a ball down a river to its destination, but the ball can get caught under a bridge on the way there, and lodge itself in such a way where it is impossible to dislodge. For the most part, the holes are fine though.The physics present in the game are well tuned, though it often feels like the ball rolls a little too much, often rolling at a slow pace for up to five seconds, cutting out sizeable chunks of your limited time on the course. Generally this is quite intuitive though, and doesn't present much of a problem.The game is somewhat poorly optimized, as nearly everyone I've played with has reported some form of FPS drop in the darker areas even on lower resolutions, including myself, but my specs aren't particularly high end so I don't tend to include myself in this. The reason you're likely here, though, isn't because of physics or optimization talk, it's likely because you're one of many people who have seen the extensive youtuber gameplay of this, and wanted to play it yourself. Yes, there are outlandish ball shapes that include eggs and cones, and yes you can jump and bounce and there's low-gravity settings. This is a mostly standard minigolf game, however, that has creative course ideas and fun shapes to play with, and odd settings to use. I enjoy the game and I intend to put at least a few more hours into it, so I'm obliged to recommend it to anybody who's looking for a creative golf game in which you can torment yourself and friends by trying to put with oversized cubes that hardly move at all.

								Aside from the lack of maps so far (it is in early access, so what can ya do), the base game is actually very fun! It's best to get 3-6 friends and just go at it. It is well worth 6 bucks, in my opinion. However, what it lacks in maps and such, it makes up for with diverse content, all the custom settings, different ways to actually play the game (golfball shapes, abilities as the ball and so on), etc. Still better than CS:GOOverall, good game,  9 outta 11 GG, have a great day Papa Bless.

								This game is so much fun. It kept me and my other buds content for like a good solid 3 hours. The only bad thing that I have to say about it that is problem is when you have to put a good amount of effort into planning when your going to do it with your friends. It's not a simple hit play and have fun. Still though, that's not something that the developers can really solve and it is still an amazing game non the less. I did a let's play of this game. It would make my day if you guys could check it out and tell me what you think. I'll put a link to it below. Have a wonderful day.

								Great game if your looking for an awesome mini golf expierence with tricky courses. Everone plays at once so there are no wait times and it offers a bunch of customizable variables like: gravity, bounciness, shape of ball, collision, and other crazy options. As of this writing the game offers 2 very unique courses with 18 holes each making it extremely worth the super low price point!10/10minigolf is life!			"

								I love the style of gameplay in this game! Still needs some work, which is to be expected at this stage though. Still very fun, especially if you have friends.I my Opinion:  -Fix the 45 second slow mo ball rolls in cirtain situations,   -Adjust the physics a tad (light taps go far, uphill shots not equalised to hit strength)  -Add a way to look around more, to see where your going with the ball? Often times i had no idea wich way to the pin.Other than that, just needs more content ;) (3 areas at the time i played with 18 holes each, still plenty for now)  -Feels Solid  -Great Graphics  -Exactly what i had in mind when looking for a Mini Golf game.

								The best mini-golf experience money can buy.Pros:Multiple courses, All unique and vary in difficultyGreat physics (semi customizable)Custom set rules/settings (max shots per hole, ball shape, size, color, ""jump"" option, gravity, it goes on...The settings gives it a lot of replayability You'll never have so much fun getting frustrated with your friendsCons:Some extreme settings can make some holes impossible. (putting a cone a few places in candyland LOL) Very few ramps/runways/general ground areas don't match up perfectly which results in little bumps to crazy physics bugs. I really have nothing bad to say about this game at all, and as soon as the game starts it gives you a warning that the game is in alpha, there are bugs, it is what it is. It's not as bad as the warning makes it seem, in my opinion. The first ""Con"" is really on you, not the game. When you change gravity, use weird shapes, and have to jump a slightly bumpy spiral ramp, and can't make it... welll... duh. lol. The second is totally understandable, it's in alpha, and they are so far and few, it's just another thing for you and your friends to laugh and cry about, just adding to the overall experience. 100% Worth it.

The fact that Golf of all things requires so much power to run at its most optimal settings is a bit of a minus but with hype of a new map coming out soon in an update, it outweights the negatives. It's fun with friends but in short bursts before repetition kicks in, but for what it is, I like this alot!			"

								At first I thought the game was just a traditional golfing game where there added a multiplayer mode to it but I was wrong that game is really fun to play with some friends like the name would suggest.So it is any good ?Disclaimer!The game being still in alpha at the time this review will maybe not be still relavent when the game will reach gold but it deserve a critic or two.The general idea :So the game takes place on one of a few golfing courses ,with all a different themes and mechanics, those golfing course are :-Forest-Oasis-Twilight-Haunted-CandylandAll the golfing courses has 18 holes ,each holes can be completed in multiple ways which it gives some replay value and a notion of experimenting in each playthrough .No Caption ProvidedMore in detail :You can customize your ball in which ever color you want.Create and join public or private lobby.Final thoughts :There is no much to say about this game because its still in developpement. The game is really fun for a Sunday afternoon with a group of friends online ,don't expect more from this title, it’s shame the game has not yet an editor it would give the game more replay value and would really bring more people to it and by consequence create a community around this fun indy game.

								This is the best kind of early access game: it passes the ""even if they never add anything to it, it was worth the purchase"" test, but it also really makes me hope they DO add lots of cool stuff to it. Pros: Visual design of the levels is charming and bright. Level design of the golf courses is pretty cool and creative. Lots of custom options (low gravity, extra-bouncy ground, TURN THE GOLF BALLS INTO CUBES?!?!?) should add longevity. I haven't played a ton, but in the time I have played I haven't encountered any ""early access issues"" with collision detection or crashing or network connection problems. YMMVCons: Really the only problem I have is that there isn't enough of this game. The current total of 5 18-hole courses can be played in a single night. But that isn't a problem. I paid less than $4 for this game, but even for the full price of a whopping $6, this is worth it. For less than the price of a movie ticket, you and your friends will definitely get more than a movie's worth of entertainment together. And since this is just the starting point, it will hopefully only become a better value as features are added.Devs: Please make a tool for building custom holes and making your own courses! That would be the bomb!			"

								(Note: This review is based on how this game was back in version 0.0.96H1, available as of 14th October 2016)So far, I only played this game solo, but from playing through all currently available courses (forest, Egypt, night-time forest and haunted house), I can say that this is definitely a decent minigolf game. It plays well, the courses are nicely varied (though I wish there was more), the music is good and the graphics are nice to look at. There's no revolution, but I got exactly what I was expecting.The only complaints I would have:- There isn't any info on how exactly you're supposed to move your ball. It took me about 10 minutes before I figured out that I am supposed to hold down LMB and move the mouse forward to determine the strength of the shot and move the ball.- It sometimes is difficult to determine where exactly you're supposed to go with the ball. Some kind of map or overhead view would be much appreciated.- The game doesn't have a dedicated single player mode (you have to set up a ""multiplayer"" game with only 1 player).- It's not a long game. Playing solo, I only took about an hour to beat all courses.- A minor nitpick, but the flags in the last 2 courses for some reason don't move when the ball gets near.The game works well and it's exactly what I wanted. I'm looking forward to actually trying it out with a couple of friends.			"

								Modern golf was invented in the mid 15th century in Scotland. When the men that created it were doing so, they said,"" Gentleman. We do not have the technology for it yet, but eventually you will be able to do this sitting down, and you will be able to play with a myriad of shapes. You will also be able to alter the sate of gravity."" Many historian can attest to the factuality of this quote. In this way, Golf With Your Friends is actually a testament to how the game was meant to be played.			"

								Rage inducing Golf game, But super fun with friends, even with strangers!The stupidity that you can do in this game, Play with a cone instead of a ball, An egg, a square, Change the gravity, Etc.It's so frustrating!!! But not in a bad way!! In a good... Funny way...This game is challenging, and very simple at the same time, Well.. Depending what room you join!Once you get the hang of it, It's very easy, and a good game to make time go by if you're bored.Honest Rating: 8.5-1.5 Due to a couple of annoying bugs in the game that haven't seem to be fixed, and it's very annoying.Sometimes you tend to go through the floor and unable to move, And then there is also MORONS who join the game that just... waste your time, It would be nice to have a kick option..

								A brilliant game worth purchasing if you have friends to play it with. There are 4 maps which feature 12 sections to play through, which will last you 2-3 hours, but there are also options to customise your game to make the game more replayable. For example, you could change your golf ball into a larger one, or a golf puck, or cube etc. I hope to see a larger variety of maps in the future along with the possibility of being able to create your own maps.

								Great game. Really fun. Yes, it is fun if you don't have any friends that have the game to play with, but it is a lot better if you can get into a game with, lets say, 4 or 5 friends. As the game is quite cheap, you could (if you wanted to) gift it for a friend and if you like the game i would certainly recommend doing so. I haven't so far lost any friends in playing it (touchwood) like some people have but do watch out for salt.Note: This is not a professional golfing career game. You don't even have to be intersted in golf to play it.			"

								A brilliant game worth purchasing if you have friends to play it with. There are 4 maps which feature 12 sections to play through, which will last you 2-3 hours, but there are also options to customise your game to make the game more replayable. For example, you could change your golf ball into a larger one, or a golf puck, or cube etc. I hope to see a larger variety of maps in the future along with the possibility of being able to create your own maps.

Alone you can hone your golfing prowess and take that skill to the green with your friends in the easy, functional online play. Five varied courses, eighteen holes each, how can you not love every single hole? Golf With Your Friends is a masterpiece, plain and simple.			"

								Golf is a game. It is terrible. Here are some reasons why.In order to play Golf, you must purchase:An unattractive plaid vestA hilarious (ideally plaid) beretBright, ugly trousers. Preferably plaid and ideally in some disgusting shade of greenAn expensive set of golf bats (Known to professionals as 'clubs')An expensive bag to haul your golf bats around inA few friends to pretend they're interested, and join you on your escapede.A device to slow the passage of time, so that your rounds of golf don't take 36 hours eachAn understanding partner.You'll be happy to hear, then, that Golf with Friends requires absoloutely none of these things!You won't need any clothes for this game. Play naked if you like. You'll be in the comfort of your own home! Nobody will judge. Unless they can see you. In which case, they might judge.You won't need to buy friends to play with you. Announce to the world that you're going to play Golf with Friends and the world will rejoice, and line up to join you. World peace will be established, Hunger will become a thing of the past and ISIS will lay down its weapons in favour of a set of friendly golf clubs.Your partner will do the same! If you have one. If you don't, then buying Golf with Friends will make you irresistable.Games take less than 40 minutes as opposed to the 40 hours of regular golf! Hell, they take WAY less than 40 minutes sometimes.JUST BUY GOLF WITH FRIENDS. THE WORLD NEEDS MORE FRIENDS, AND NEEDS TO GOLF WITH THEM...also it's pretty cheap. You know, for all the enjoyment it brings. "

								Golf With Your Friends or GWYF or Gilf for short, is a game about putting balls in holes and being short. It succeeds in doing that rather well if i'm being honest, with each hole having a 2 minute timelimit and adding that each course has 18 holes. that equates to about 36 minutes per 18 set of holes. Adding that there is 4 holes and 60 mins in an hour. The average joe would say that this game is only 2:24 hours of unique gameplay. JOE WOULD BE WRONGJoe didn't think about all of the color options! Silly joeAnd all the friends he could play withIf we add all the color spectrum and all of the friends that you have You can calculate that 2:30hours x 10,000,000 colors x 0 friendsThis game actually has 0 hours of gameplay...Oh♥♥♥♥The math adds upI.....im sorry...refund please?

								Pros: _Easy to pick up-Difficult to master_Super fun to play with a friend(s)_4 maps available at the time of this review_Multiple settings for gravity, ball shape, terrain rigidity etc_Looks nice_Runs at a stable fps_Price for fun ratio is very goodCons:_Early Access_Occasional bugs (clipping issues, balls bouncing/rolling forever, etc)_No tutorial or instructional graphic or anything at all explaing how the controls work (you will pick them up really quickly, but there should at least be a graphic with some text r something)_Poor filter/search options for multiplayer serversComments:This game is already worth $6 in it's current state. There are occasional bugs and graphical glitches, but it's not enough to ruin the experience. My buddy and I have had a great time with it. Lots of laughs and amazingly lucky/unlucky shots. Fooling around with the various map options makes every map play differently, so theres more depth to the game than it would apear at first glance. Honestly, I think it's pretty great. Just hard enough to be fun while still managing to be a relaxing experience. Solid thumbs up.			"

								Don't expect some high quality nintendo or xbox golf game. This game is golf with your friends. It's designed to be fun that's it. It has some bugs and glitches, but for the price it has to be one of the greatest games I have played. I HIGHLY reccomend getting a copy (I bought 2 copies for friends even). GET THIS GAME!			"

								Where do I start?I've logged around 15 hours in the first month or so of me owning this game. That's mildly concerning.Any way, this might just be the best golf video game I've ever played. It's one of those games that, although it doesn't have next gen graphics or a compelling story, it's something special. You know it's good when the glitches aren't completely frustrating, but they rather provide some of the entertainment, especially if you're in a call with your friends.About the whole friend thing...Yeah, you basically need friends to play this game. Otherwise it's pointless. It's in the name, I mean come on.The one thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off in my experience with GwYF was some of the shapes people wanted to use. I can kinda see the appeal in using a cube, but a cone? Really? It just spins. Pros- Fantastic multiplayer gameplay that will keep you entertained (and possibly hysterical) for hours- Great variation of courses with more to come- Not too demanding (my HP laptop can handle this game)- A frickin' goat statue.- A bit glitchyCons- A bit glitchy- Stupid shapes- It's only fun if you're with your friends. With random people it's just boring.If I had to give this game a rating...I'd probably give it an 8.9/10. There's still work to be done on this game, but in the meantime, the four courses provide plenty of fun for you and your friends for this sensational indie game.			"

								Great game to play with your friends or with random people online. It's a fun addictive golf game where you don't even have to play with a ball! You can play with random shapes like cubes and even acorns! You can customise each game for example by making the gravity lower, making the floor bouncier, making the balls (or random shapes) collide with each other, or by allowing players to make their golf balls jump! Would recommend this game!			"

The concept is very easy but the course provides some tough challenges, especially if you use custom ball shapes (acorn-shape is absolutely ridiculous). Lots of fun watching your friends struggle with a hole that took you two strokes. For a simple-concept game, it is a good change of pace from the usual.			"

								This isn't your dad's video golf. Fast paced, multiplayer action make this an incredible bargain for under $6. With four courses and a fifth one on the way soon, this game is a steal. There are a few small bugs as it's still in early access, but overall the game is very playable.Cons: The default setting will heat up your CPU/GPU so you need to lock the FPS to 30 or 60 instead of leaving it on 'unlimited'. Sometimes this setting will revert back and must be changed again. One obvious thing that is missing is a 'high score' record, hopefully this gets added later. Lastly, signing up for a Classic game only to have it changed to Custom at the last minute can be aggravating. I would like to see classic games locked to classic upon creation.Pros: Several custom options keep the game interesting should you get bored of playing on classic mode, and the skee ball game on the practice course is something fun to do while you wait for your party to assemble.Overall great game! 8.5/10			"

								Golf With Your Friends is probably one of the top games you will get on the store for it's price. With the sale going on as we speak, I highly suggest picking up the game, even if it is to just have in your library. As the alpha testing currently shows, this game can prove to blow up to be huge one day. Pros//There is a very open and welcoming community to join into. I have been invited to play with about 5 different strangers in the course of 3 days of having the game just for being online. //Balance between competitive and chill gameplay. You can choose when to tryhard and don't have to worry about slacking a few games.//Achievements are definitely something to strive for as this game is still being developed.//Costs very little compared to other titles.//Mutator settings add variety to gameplay.//Multiplayer is both fun and exciting in a public server or a private lobby of your own.//Free roam in multiplayer lobby is definitely a new idea for a golf game.//Already has huge player base.Cons//Other than poor RGB sliders, the game has little customization implementations.//Offers little replayability. Does begin to get repetitive as you play the game.//Visuals are on the low side (thus far)Final ThoughtsI definitely do see this game going places in the future. I have seen how responsive the develpopers and moderators are both in discord and through steam. They do make sure to keep up with how the community is coming along, and how the growth of the game as well. Like I said, this game is still in it's alpha stages and has plenty of room for improvement to become outstanding so I will positively give this game a 92/100 in  it's early days. I look forward to seeing how well this game turns out!			"

								Game seems to be fun, only played 6 holes before being kicked for telling the kids to stop and play the game correctly. i only played my very first game (online) and i was shocked at how vulgar (harassment, hate speech) and trolly people are. I didn't see a report button, maybe there is one but if not that'd be a feature i'd like to see being added.Update: Played more online games, made some new friends. Not sure if it was just that one game or i'm bound to run into more people like that. Anyways, i would still recommend playing with close friends, share some laughs, and have a great time!			"

								This isn't your dad's video golf. Fast paced, multiplayer action make this an incredible bargain for under $6. With four courses and a fifth one on the way soon, this game is a steal. There are a few small bugs as it's still in early access, but overall the game is very playable.Cons: The default setting will heat up your CPU/GPU so you need to lock the FPS to 30 or 60 instead of leaving it on 'unlimited'. Sometimes this setting will revert back and must be changed again. One obvious thing that is missing is a 'high score' record, hopefully this gets added later. Lastly, signing up for a Classic game only to have it changed to Custom at the last minute can be aggravating. I would like to see classic games locked to classic upon creation.Pros: Several custom options keep the game interesting should you get bored of playing on classic mode, and the skee ball game on the practice course is something fun to do while you wait for your party to assemble.Overall great game! 8.5/10			"

								10/10Really fun game and couldn't say no when it was part of the Summer Steam sales. Some glitches as to be expected for an early access game but a lot have been or are getting smoothed out as time goes on. My friends and I like to all get in a TS and then let the shenanigans unfold from there which is always good for a laugh.Things that I hope they address:-adding at least 3 more maps-add a ""Search"" feature for finding specific lobbies-adding some sort of (optional) ingame voice chat so you can vocally talk with other people in the game-changing the hole times by increments of 15 seconds instead of 30 (hard to do a speed round in 30sec but 1 min seems to be too much as well)-enable punctuation in the lobby title (want this so I can make the title the TS IP)-some way of reducing that eternal roll your ball can get stuck in on some of the mild slopesOverall love this game and all it's other features. Jump is a little cheap but for some reason everyone seems to love it. The random shapes games can be tough enough to make one pull their hair out. I would have no problem buying this at it's current price of $5.99 even. Well worth it especially if you can get a group of friends to join in.FOUR!!			"

								The game is fun when you play with your friends, but if you play solo its kinda boring. But the system requirements aren't accurate at all. You need way more than 512mb vram and more than 1.8 ghz processor, maybe the 4 gigs of RAM are enough, but if i were them, i would put 6 or 8gb. It lags on my pc, although  I ''meet'' the system requirements. Here are more ""accurate"" requirements: at least 3.1 ghz processor, 2 or 4 gb VRAM, 6 gb RAM. To wrap this review up, its a fun game, good engine, nice and fun maps too play on. Worth the 5$.			"

								Really fun game. Had loads of laughs. This is game is only really fun with friends though. I understand that the game is in the Early Access but I wish there was more maps, but for the $5.99 price tag in which I payed for it, It's well worth it.			"

								Golf With Your Friends is a game that has great potential; after more courses are added (community-made course support?), it will easily be a classic.I'm not a big fan of the changes made in the recent update (new music/physics), but with time I will get used to them.9/10			"

								Golf With Your Friends or GWYF or Gilf for short, is a game about putting balls in holes and being short. It succeeds in doing that rather well if i'm being honest, with each hole having a 2 minute timelimit and adding that each course has 18 holes. that equates to about 36 minutes per 18 set of holes. Adding that there is 4 holes and 60 mins in an hour. The average joe would say that this game is only 2:24 hours of unique gameplay. JOE WOULD BE WRONGJoe didn't think about all of the color options! Silly joeAnd all the friends he could play withIf we add all the color spectrum and all of the friends that you have You can calculate that 2:30hours x 10,000,000 colors x 0 friendsThis game actually has 0 hours of gameplay...Oh♥♥♥♥The math adds upI.....im sorry...refund please?

								Pros: _Easy to pick up-Difficult to master_Super fun to play with a friend(s)_4 maps available at the time of this review_Multiple settings for gravity, ball shape, terrain rigidity etc_Looks nice_Runs at a stable fps_Price for fun ratio is very goodCons:_Early Access_Occasional bugs (clipping issues, balls bouncing/rolling forever, etc)_No tutorial or instructional graphic or anything at all explaing how the controls work (you will pick them up really quickly, but there should at least be a graphic with some text r something)_Poor filter/search options for multiplayer serversComments:This game is already worth $6 in it's current state. There are occasional bugs and graphical glitches, but it's not enough to ruin the experience. My buddy and I have had a great time with it. Lots of laughs and amazingly lucky/unlucky shots. Fooling around with the various map options makes every map play differently, so theres more depth to the game than it would apear at first glance. Honestly, I think it's pretty great. Just hard enough to be fun while still managing to be a relaxing experience. Solid thumbs up.			"

								Golf is a game. It is terrible. Here are some reasons why.In order to play Golf, you must purchase:An unattractive plaid vestA hilarious (ideally plaid) beretBright, ugly trousers. Preferably plaid and ideally in some disgusting shade of greenAn expensive set of golf bats (Known to professionals as 'clubs')An expensive bag to haul your golf bats around inA few friends to pretend they're interested, and join you on your escapede.A device to slow the passage of time, so that your rounds of golf don't take 36 hours eachAn understanding partner.You'll be happy to hear, then, that Golf with Friends requires absoloutely none of these things!You won't need any clothes for this game. Play naked if you like. You'll be in the comfort of your own home! Nobody will judge. Unless they can see you. In which case, they might judge.You won't need to buy friends to play with you. Announce to the world that you're going to play Golf with Friends and the world will rejoice, and line up to join you. World peace will be established, Hunger will become a thing of the past and ISIS will lay down its weapons in favour of a set of friendly golf clubs.Your partner will do the same! If you have one. If you don't, then buying Golf with Friends will make you irresistable.Games take less than 40 minutes as opposed to the 40 hours of regular golf! Hell, they take WAY less than 40 minutes sometimes.JUST BUY GOLF WITH FRIENDS. THE WORLD NEEDS MORE FRIENDS, AND NEEDS TO GOLF WITH THEM...also it's pretty cheap. You know, for all the enjoyment it brings. "

								Game seems to be fun, only played 6 holes before being kicked for telling the kids to stop and play the game correctly. i only played my very first game (online) and i was shocked at how vulgar (harassment, hate speech) and trolly people are. I didn't see a report button, maybe there is one but if not that'd be a feature i'd like to see being added.Update: Played more online games, made some new friends. Not sure if it was just that one game or i'm bound to run into more people like that. Anyways, i would still recommend playing with close friends, share some laughs, and have a great time!			"

'This game is best for when you have a girlfriend and/or friends.'I recommend this game for people who want them to lose there friends and/or family.After a couple of holes you start trowing stuff like a crimal who is getting a deadsentence.The first hole you win after this you will yell like a wild lion when he's gettin laid for the first time.But the game always ends the same, like the one before --you broke stuff and have lost some(can differ) friend(s) and in my case also my girlfriend. Starting to play this game from an invite from my GF , best lifechoise I've ever made so far.10/10 Would play again with new girlfriend.			"

								This is a game that has the potential to be a great little minigolf game, but isn't quite there yet.  The main issue is that the dividing line between success and disaster is too fine.  When the only way to complete a hole is to hit precisely one spot, with no margin for error, the frustration level piles up quickly.  You're not alone here, Blacklight - Vertiginous Golf has essentially the same problem.  Having a rotten angle or needing to just putt out to safety is enough of a penalty; having to replay a stroke until gotten exactly right sucks the fun factor way down.It's a principle of golf course design -- and the same applies to minigolf -- that if the route to the hole is high-risk, there should be a bail out option for players who aren't at that level yet.  I certainly wouldn't play a regular golf course where every tee shot required a 300 yard carry over water with no other way to the hole.A little on-course direction would be a good idea -- it doesn't need to be precise, but when you're on a timer and don't know which way the hole is, that doesn't help the frustration level either.That said, it is a very good game.  The graphics are excellent (if a little eye-twisting on Candy Land), the mechanics are straightforward, the play is smooth, and the music is not only appropriate, it's even kind of charming.Overall, Recommended.  If the vast gulf between risk and reward narrows, I would even change that to Highly Recommended... but not yet.			"

								This game, it is so much fun. Once they add new levels this game will be great. My friends and I had so much fun, (and a lot of double bogeys). Even when you're losing you still feel like you have a chance, because the holes are so beautifully designed (and a little unfair, but in a good way) that at any moment the leader could drop back 12 strokes. I had a lot of fun playing this. I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

								If you like mini golf then this is definitely the game for you, the gameplay is smooth unless you mess around with the settings too much (you can end up breaking the game by bouncing around too much when you're out of bounds)There's very simple controls. The courses are fun especially when your mates don't have a clue where to go and they end up with maximum strokes for that hole resulting in them raging a little ;)12 player online support is awesome and I can't wait for more courses to be added to the game.10/10 would break the game again!

								Pro's: -Fun game-Addicting-Easy to control-Nice and original ways to play golf (jumping, play with a puck, low gravity,...)-Lobby's for up to 12 people-You can practise while the host is waiting for players to fill the lobby-You can customize your ball with the RGB color system. So a lot of colors!Con's:-If the host is afk the lobby will be open for hours and you can waste a lot of time waiting for him to start the game-You can't invate friends, you have to join the same lobby-Only 3 maps available.

								Golf with Friends right now is abit basic but even with it being bear boned and basic theres really some fun options in it to have a great game night with friends. so id highly recommed this game for its price and its fun and the fact that the devs are very active and the road map for this game looks great i have to say this could be one of the best minigolf games maybe even one of the best party games once its abit more finshed .

								Pros about this game:+Not a Demanding Game+Hardly any glitches or bugs despite being in early access+Easy to play+Fun & Enjoyable especially with FRIENDS+Good Connectivity and Infomation on Server choice+Multiple Region Severs so you can play with friend overseas (US, Asia, Australia, Europe, Japan)+Customizable ball colorCons about this game:-Not alot of players YET-Too little levels at the moment (26/4/2016)-Controls are abit weird, (push forward to charge power ?)-Sometimes Crashes (1/8 times)-Cannot see the entire course unless you've played it a few timesConclusion:The game is very fun and easy to play with very nice looking graphics. Playing this game is very fun with friends and its really cheap on specs which is good as more people can play it despite owning a graphics cardless tablet... however the lack of customizable controls and lack of levels at the moment is hindering the number of people playing the game. This can be improved by having multiple sets of controls to suit different needs. Another drawback is the fact that you dont know where the hole is unless you've shot your ball or played it a few times making it very hard for hole in one for new players. It can be improved by adding a mini map or a walk around view to see what the entire course looks like. At this stage of development, i wouldn't reccomend playing this game ALONE... unless your friends have it, then buying it would be worth it ! "

								After playing this game for a quick bit, I was surprised with how much fun virtual golf could give me. The course design is very good and although the customization is pretty mediocre, the simple to learn controls and fun atmosphere certainly are a welcome to me. However, there are a few optimizations to be made, as I have a GTX 970, and can get about an average of 30 FPS. After that gets fixed, it's a pretty damn solid game. Oh, did I mention modifiers? That's a game changer as changing gravity, or giving the ability to jump adds a new element to the game which I really enjoy and adds a new way to play. I like this game yes, but with customization, and optimization, I would LOVE this game.			"

								WE NEED MORE MAPS AT A FASTER RATE! Even if you allow them to be used during a beta version where everything has been perfected, there seems to be a ton of youtubers and gamers around that are really enhoying this game but the lack of variety makes it hard to want to keep playing. The new map is amazing and that will add much more enjoyable playing time for me but I feel that the community would enjoy a ton of new maps even if they are still in beta! That's just my opinion and wht I ahve heard from my friend and others that I have played with on Golf With Friends. I doubt this will even be seen or anything will be done about it because I understand they are working as hard as they can but I figured I would state my opinion on the odd chance that it could actualy make a change!

								Even in its early release, the game already looks awesome! The game provides a great variety of features, really nice graphics and excellent physics.Also, the developers really put effort in the game, as they constantly release new updates, hotfixes, etc...Great work!Overview:+ Game and graphics look awesome+ Physics are realistic+ ""Custom settings"" option provides tons of fun and usefull settings+ Light effect on the ball in darker places looks nice+ Online gameplay = tons of fun+ The current maps look awesome and I personally can't wait for a map editor.- The game sometimes appear laggy and unstable, especially when loading, even with an Intel i7-6700HQ with 8CPU's and a NVidia GTX 980m 4GB. - On some laptops and some networks, the ball suddenly stops rolling without reason. (since update Haunted House)- Some textures, like clouds and fire, look really bad, compared to the other graphics in the game.- The launch screen with options can be removed, as you can choose your options ingame. ~ If there has to be a launch screen, redesign it like it's part of the game. :)  "

								I was told about Golf With Your Friends by a friend. They gifted it to me, and after only a course I had bought it for another friend, who bought it for another friend, and so on. With a Discord server full of people playing and shouting over what the best shot is for someone on their 11th stroke (the answer is FULL POWER), I can definitely say that this game has captured the something that lets friends just play and have fun. The modifiers are great as well; 12-player with collision enabled turns Oasis into a Max Max hellscape, and Candyland with jumping turns the last hole into a game of skill.If there is one thing I would like to see in this game, it's Workshop support for custom courses. While it's still in Early Access with 5 courses and potentially more on the way, the ability to make crazy designs for a course is something I really desire. Other than that, the game is flawless.Golf With Your Friends. Full Power.Review Addendum: Please increase the max player limit to 24. We've had to start two separate lobbies because of how many people are playing at once. Heck, go the distance and make it 100. We're already in crazy town, might as well stay and set up shop.			"

								*Very fun game for happy golfers*Since this is a happy golfing game it will make you happy when you play it. You can play it with FRIENDS or online with strange but happy golfers. They are often nice and happy and you have time to chat with them and to have a happy time. If someone is not happy, make him happy.You can create your own room for private fun or happy public golf. When I scroll through the game browser, I see all the room names and they are very funny. It makes me so happy.There are many options for the game like you can play as an acorn or a happy little puck. When you enable the jump feature it will offer many new ways to put your golfing ball into the hole. When I get a hole in one I am always very happy and I write ""hol"" into the chat. Then everyone is happy.You can also enable collisions for the game. While this could sound dangerous at first, believe me it is the opposite. With collisions on you can help other happy golfers to move their ball into the hole. The first time someone helped me, I was so happy I couldn't believe it. And now, I spread my happiness by helping others too. It makes them so happy.But in this golfing game there are no clubs. In this game, the goal is to be happy which means that you move the ball with your mouse. Remember there are no clubs. You see the ball from the outside. You are within the ball itself. You are the ball, I am the ball, we all are the ball. And it makes us happy.All in all, you should buy this fine piece of virtual golfing software technology because I will guarantee you that it will make you so happy. Especially, the new land with all the sweet candy. It is so sweet. It just makes me so happy. When you buy this game then you will not only become very happy but you will also be enlightened. Especially, when you press L. This game changed my hol life and I am so happy. "

								fun mini-golf game... even though i'm still pretty potato at it lol. some of the holes are very challenging and there's an excellent variety of them on the nicely themed courses. speaking of courses, a new one called Candyland has been added since i first wrote this review & they're also working on an Aztec/Dinosaur map right now.my only gripe is that the gravity needs a little tweaking as the ball doesn't seem to bounce quite like a real one & the balloons appear to be too heavy in practice mode. but-- i am currently waiting on an update to finish right now on my molasses internet, so possibly the gravity has already been adjusted & i may need to edit this review shortly.♥♥♥♥♥ing aside, it's a very enjoyable, well-done game with good graphics & pleasant music that's worth at least every penny of its low cost.

								It's everything frustrating about mini-golf, but with other shaped objects, jumping, and even more hazards.It's enjoyable solo, but it's a blast if you can get a friend or two to play with.  You get to compete to not get last place, because you're sure as hell aren't beating par with different settings.  They're constantly adding new content and maps, so that's more enjoyment for us.  The golfing WITH friends definitely adds to the game's experience and makes it 200% more enjoyable.The only complaint I have is how difficult it is to get the cone up a ramp.

								The Tony Hawk series of games mastered the niche skateboarding genre, and the Punch Out series of games mastered the niche boxing genre, but has the Golf genre been perfected yet? I don't know, I guess there's quite a few decent golf games out there.Golf With Your Friends is trying to perfect mini-golf, and does do something better than other golf games, in my opinion-- that is you don't have to pause a lot and take turns. At the point of writing this, there are 4 different courses filled with moving obstacles, bounce pads, and other gimmicks. You can also create custom games, where you can manipulate gravity, use balls of different (or random) shapes and sizes, turn on collision, and/or turn on jumping. It even got me to spend some time trying to find hole-in-ones. There aren't any powerups or collectibles, though. I don't feel that those are necessary, but if we're trying to make the perfect golf game, I feel that those would be good to include.Golf With Your Friends is obviously going to be more enjoyable with other people. I am very lucky in that I had a large group of people on Discord, and played with like 8 people at once. And I kicked all their asses. There is a server list that lets you join other random strangers, though, if you don't have anyone to play with.			"

								This is a game that has the potential to be a great little minigolf game, but isn't quite there yet.  The main issue is that the dividing line between success and disaster is too fine.  When the only way to complete a hole is to hit precisely one spot, with no margin for error, the frustration level piles up quickly.  You're not alone here, Blacklight - Vertiginous Golf has essentially the same problem.  Having a rotten angle or needing to just putt out to safety is enough of a penalty; having to replay a stroke until gotten exactly right sucks the fun factor way down.It's a principle of golf course design -- and the same applies to minigolf -- that if the route to the hole is high-risk, there should be a bail out option for players who aren't at that level yet.  I certainly wouldn't play a regular golf course where every tee shot required a 300 yard carry over water with no other way to the hole.A little on-course direction would be a good idea -- it doesn't need to be precise, but when you're on a timer and don't know which way the hole is, that doesn't help the frustration level either.That said, it is a very good game.  The graphics are excellent (if a little eye-twisting on Candy Land), the mechanics are straightforward, the play is smooth, and the music is not only appropriate, it's even kind of charming.Overall, Recommended.  If the vast gulf between risk and reward narrows, I would even change that to Highly Recommended... but not yet.			"

								After playing this game for a quick bit, I was surprised with how much fun virtual golf could give me. The course design is very good and although the customization is pretty mediocre, the simple to learn controls and fun atmosphere certainly are a welcome to me. However, there are a few optimizations to be made, as I have a GTX 970, and can get about an average of 30 FPS. After that gets fixed, it's a pretty damn solid game. Oh, did I mention modifiers? That's a game changer as changing gravity, or giving the ability to jump adds a new element to the game which I really enjoy and adds a new way to play. I like this game yes, but with customization, and optimization, I would LOVE this game.			"

								10/10  Best game ever! No problems what so ever. I'm suprised that they are still in alpha. Suggest buying it.			"

								Really fun game! I love Mini golf and have been wanting a good one to play, online play is fast and fun everyone shoots at the same time. Could use more courses and some of the courses can be a little confusing at first (Could use some indicators as to where you are trying to go) but once you know the courses this doesn't matter. Would like to see the system requirments go down so I could play on my Windows tablet!			"

								Its actually kinda fun. I was pretty much addicted to it for about 6 hours the other day. Most of the people i played with were pretty funny. Nobody really screwed around either. Graphics are good music is awful. Turn it off immediately! Overall id recommenced the game because its cheap and you do get some good laughs and some genuine rage.			"

								A great game to play with friends. Even though the variety of maps is quite lacking, the game delivers enough fun with friends to justify its price.			"
