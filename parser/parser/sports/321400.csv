Early Access Review
								EDIT: I just can't recommend the game right now due to the lack of players. When the playercount increases to the point where you can fairly easily get into a game with people at similar skill levels to you I'll remove this edit. Just bear in mind the low playercount if you're considering buying the game. Innovative, addictive and incredibly satisfying. Whether you have played for 1 hour or 1,000 hours the awesome feeling you get from being a part of epic plays never fades. The game is quite unpolished but if you can see through the clunky UI and lacking features there is a great game beneath. As with a lot of Early Access games, it's a diamond in the rough.  Supraball in comparison to Rocket League:   ""Deathball..."" (the predecessor of Supraball) ""... was one of the main reasons why Rocket League exists"" - Psyonix Adam on Reddit  I expect this comparison is what a lot of people will be wanting to know. I'll preface this section by saying I have about 650 ingame hours in Rocket League and about 2,000 in Supraball.  Rocket League gave me a very similar feeling of excitement that I got from Supraball when I first started playing.  Deep down at their core they are essentially the same game - put the ball in the goal, just with different methods of doing so. Both are very pure, simple games which give you some basic controls and then set you free to do what you wish.  I feel like Supraball gives you a lot more ways to be creative  and play the game though to the degree that every second of the game you are holding the ball the tree of your choices branches 100 times: will you do a little rollspin to juke a defender, will you pass to a teammate who is boosted and flying across the map for a volley combo, will you panic and do a horrible pass back to your keeper and score a hilarious own goal or will you do the countless other things available to you?  More complex plays are also far more accessible in Supraball,  within 100 hours of play you can be setting up strong charge to volley goals to score 300km/h screamer goals, whereas in Rocket League setting up a pass play like this is far, far more difficult.  The autolock pass also makes passing very easy and allows new players to perform teamplay quite easily.  Now let's move onto the pro's and con's of Supraball in it's Early Access State. Pros: +++  Every match plays differently.  There are so many different ways to play that you never end up playing the same game twice. It has the ""just 1 more match"" feeling and so can be very addictive and has huge replayability. +++  4 unique positions to play: Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder and Striker.  You can sink thousands of hours into a position and still have room to learn and innovate. Or, don't conform to the meta, you're free to play however you want!++  The skill ceiling is disgustingly high , I have sunk probably 2000 hours into goalkeeping in the Alpha/Beta and I'm not even close to the skill cap. The skill floor is pretty high too, but even when you first start playing and have no idea what you're doing it is still really enjoyable++ Applying curves and combinations of curves to your shots gives huge variety to the gameplay and  lots of opportunities for creative, unique and flashy plays ++  A short in-game tutorial and some follow up tutorial videos really help you to get to grips with the high skill floor.  The game has alot to learn and the tutorial covers all of the basics, with some sections (such as the goalkeeper training) which are even useful to me with a few thousand hours playtime.+  Intuitive and fairly simple controls  similar to most FPS games+  There's something for everyone . Public matches are more casual and relaxed and ranked is more serious. It's enjoyable to play even if you typically don't like sports games like myself.+ Multiple varients of the 3v3 and 5v5 maps (similar to Rocket League) with different visual styles+ Even if this game does not do too well and has a small playerbase (eg. 50 to 100 players) it can still be fun. The whole time I have played from 0 to 2000 hours there has probably been an average of 40 players online and even so it is a blast. Ehhh: ~Only 2 game modes (3v3 and 5v5) though both gamemodes focus on very different ways of playing~ Curved shots bouncing off of walls are unintuitive but add a huge amount of depth to the game  that allows crazy solo wall jukes and is why the striker position is viable Cons: ---  A clunky UI and missing lots of useful features such as easily partying with friends, good matchmaking and team matchmaking (these features are planned).  The lobby system has matchmaking within it to balance teams but there is no way to easily queue and join a match like you can in Rocket League.--  For some people the optimisation is god awful even on a monster rig, for others the game runs perfectly on a terrible computer.  --  The price is based on the gameplay and potential of future content, not the amount of content it has right now.  This game is priced similarly to Rocket League, but doesn't have any of the extra features. You may want to hold off on purchasing until these features are added if they are important to you.  This problem has been mostly solved by the significant (50% ish) price drop.-The devs ""rely on the community renting the majority of servers"", which is certainly not something I'm used to in my games and seems very strange to me- Despite what the steam store says  the game is fairly unpolished,  lacking a lot of nice little features like cosmetics or unlockables- Whilst the game can be played by ignoring your teammates, utilising them properly is the best way to play. This might not appeal to some pure solo players-  Some bugs can affect the mid to high level of play,  include random weird bounces off of walls and occasionally your shield not working. These are almost entirely unnoticeable in the first 100 hours of play though and will hopefully be patched tl;dr: It's basically meth Edit: The default controls can be a bit wonky, I would advise changing the following:""Pass"" to RMB, ""Kick"" to LMB, ""Pull-Catch"" to left shift, ""Quickshot"" to Middle Mouse. ""Shield"" to RMB and the others whatever you feel comfortable with. If you want to goalkeep, turn ""double tap dash"" off and set the ""Dash Jump"" key to something you feel comfortable with.			"

								-----------------------EDIT-----------------------As the game have mostly ""died"" since i wrote my review, i'll edit it and say that i do not recommend bying the game at this current state.The devs are planning going free-2-play somewhere in the future and i would keep my eye out for that instead.While this is said, my old review still stands, the game is still good. definitely worth it if there were more players. -Sorry to the people who i've convinced to buy the game within the last 4-6 months as the game has been mostly dead for that duration.I should've editted my review sooner.-----------------------OLD REVIEW-----------------------Been watching this game grow for a while, the devs are very interactive, love getting the communitys feedback, and definitely take what you say into concideration.It is nice seeing the developement of the game has been boosted so much since release, i hope that people will look past the early developement stages, and stick around for when this becomes a finished game.I personally think the devs have proven they are learning with the task, and i'm definitely sure that without a doubt this game will turn out great, if just the community would back it up!

Early Access Review
								Finding this gem of a game in the summer of 2014 was one the best decisions I've made. No game has given me more pleasure in competing and compelled me to become the best player I can be for my team. I don't think there is another game with the same emphasis on team-play that Supraball has. It's like soccer mixed with hockey but with guns that can shoot the ball really fast with different spins/curves. The graphics may be a turn off for some individuals but I hope that people can look past the cartoon look as there is more to gameplay than just graphics. There are still a few bugs but that is why this is only the early access release and not the final release. I look forward to meeting the newer players and hopefully together we can make this game a competitive e-sport.I urge any new players to watch the tutorial videos or complete most of the in game tutorial. The mechanics of the game are pretty simple, but you can manipulate these mechanics in ways you won't believe at first.* For a starter tip make sure you get familiar with how lock passes work and how your movement affects the route of the ball as it travels toward you.EditThis game has really been struggling with its player base so keep that in mind when you are going to purchase this game (especially if your NA). 4/9/2017: While the playerbase is still struggling a recent update now allows you to get a match within 1 minute against bots.

								9/10 - One of the best FPS games I've ever played. It's entirely unique and I love that,Although a bit tricky to learn at first, once I got the hang of Supraball I found myself losing time far too easily. This game is fast-paced, energetic, dynamic and highly addictive. The community is friendly and willing to help and I see a bright future ahead for Supraball. Highly recommended to try.			"

								Pros - TEAMPLAY is the most Important thing to do- Very good and unique gameplay- Nice graphic style- Low system requirements- Very friendly community ( That will mostly change )- Also skill based- friendly devs- not too complicated controllsCons- Pretty expensive for the content that it has and that it will have- There are already alot of pro´s with have like 500 and 2000 hours of playing, playing against those  are in some modes anoying :O- Not much of features (still Ea but they had  worked  on it a long time)- The game can get boring really fast depending on what kind of player you are - You need to wait a long time till you can start a match ( 10 - 20 min maybe longer )- Low playerbase ( I know thats this game is an EA but the price scares people maybe create a demo to test it )- Idk but when a match starts people have mostly a higher rank and are better than you ( Not to high but still good )- The game has not much  features (potential) to add  (will become boring for some people )Thats why I dont recommend the game.Yeah and I know that I havent played this game a long time but I was never really complaining about the gameplay I was rather praising it. But with the time I spend on it I could see how the game is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------That are just MY thoughts you can always try this yourself for me this is just a decent game .

								I do not recommend this game at all in the current state.Pros- Fun game to play with friends- The game idea has potential but the developers seem clueless - Dedicated servers (for now)Cons- Very very few players and none in Australia even during peak time- The game seems exactly the same as beta 18 months ago- It's unlikely they will improve the game during EA- The server list is still outside of the game- The UI has been reskinned and the arenas graphically updated (only changes in 18 months)- Game is unplayable with lag due to teleporting- Overpriced which will deter players and without players a mp game is dead			"

								Great game with no players. Wait for it to leave early access before considering a purchase, as even the devs advise this decision at this point. This is a recommendation against buying, not nessesarily a negative review against the game itself, as the mechanics and nuances of gamplay are tuned to perfection, even when compared to a fully released game, there's just nobody to play with whatsoever. Will update the review when the game leaves early access and as it is given more content.			"

								This game, it quickly became one of, if not, my favourite game back in the alpha stage 2 years ago. It's easy to learn but very hard to master, in fact, no one has even come close to mastering it yet. But don't let that scare you, after training and just playing around with friends for a little bit, when you become a little more adapted and better at the game, you will get addicted, it is a ton of fun. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who's interested, you should all give it a try, it's wonderful.tldr: good game, buy it			"

								For sure the best ""Soccer"" game on the market. I've played it since the alpha version and there i've understood the BIG potential of this new eSport.Talking about the idea behind the game, i think it represents something new  that can't be found in other games. Jumping 4 times in a row, shooting a ball at hundreds kmh, literally knocking down enemy just to get the ball... ALMOST A PERFECT GAME.  I really hope that the kind community will grow in time becoming one of the biggest in the world.			"

Early Access Review
								Everything about this game is new and exciting, this is newest inventive sport game that has grabbed my attention next to Rocket League. It takes time to learn and master the game, and having little to no player base right now leaves very few chances to actually grasp the concept and understand it, but all it takes is one steam sale to grow the player base and make this game super fun again. Although i have only played two hours on steam, I played it back before it was on greenlight with friends, and it felt so good to finally pay for it on relive it.The community is simply just old Deathball (original game before supraball) players that have been playing since the games conception and instabought it when it became available on steam. Asking them for help in game is your best shot at learning to be honest, and most of them will be willing to help you. They love this game and want it to be as great and busy as it used to be, so crushing noobs that don't know any better won't help when they are on your team later.The community is small right now, but will fill up. The developers know this issue and really want it to fill up. They are very transperant in all of their announcements and have all players (especially new ones) in mind. They have recently updated a bunch of tutorials for the true beginners, and then the community is always nice in game and will help you.This is a great game, well worth the $20 once the community fills up and sales start happening. It pains me to see such bad reviews because few people have bought it yet. It is a good game, its unfortunate the player base is still small but will surely pick up. It is fun when there are people to play with, and I have yet to run into anyone that is rude or mean. Just alot of old wise Supraball players that have been playing before it was even named Supraball.Basically, Yes the community is small and hard to find matches, but this is the beginning of something bigger. When the community picks up so will this game, but i still highly recommend it.			"

								I have always been a fan of team sports, especially those that involve advancing an object to an opposing goal, like football, basketball, and hockey.  There are constant individual moves and coordinated team strategies going on that make each sport beautiful.  Any amazing effort or foolish mistake can mean success or failure.  This is Supraball.Supraball can be enjoyed on a casual level, but competitive Supraball really shines.  Your teammates are counting on you.  Your heart is pounding; your adrenaline flowing.  I have never experienced this from any other video game.The game is in early access.  I look forward to more features, and improved polish.  The gameplay is great, but it still needs features like instant replay to be a great full release.Regardless, I've had years of fun playing Supraball and it's predecessor, Deathball.  It's a great game and it has huge potential.  It gives lazy, fat gamers like me the same feeling I'm sure professional athletes get.			"

								The only negative thing I have to say about Supraball is the fact that it's SO GOOD that it has made almost every other game seem boring and mundane to me. I've played this game since August of 2014 and have never experienced a dull moment. If you are into competitive games then Supraball is a must. The amount of teamwork and the infinite amount of strategies you can come up with has made this game an all time favorite for me. It's a great game for both casual and competitive players with some of the most complex and unique game mechanics in any game i've ever played. Playing this game is like entering a time machine. 5 hours feel like 30 minutes and each game plays out differently from the next. Supraball also has a very high skill cap and incredible e-sport potential. I'm telling you guys, this game is a gem and there is no other game like it.10/10 would recommend			"

								Wall of text! \o/One of the few games I happily spent some money on. However I don't really recommend doing the same thing for new players. But let me explain.I have no clue when did I get hooked into the game. Probably I saw someone streaming the game and decided to try it out. It was free to download, it was in alpha and it was quite fun. A few skilled players taught me the most important moves and tricks and I slowly figured out how these things work. And then I got a Closed beta key for free and after that, we're here.I knew what awaited me when I bought the game. No risk for me (aside from the usual ""it's a dead game *hurr durr* waste of money""). I enjoy it because I know what I am, and other players are capable of. As a new player it's risky because you'll either like it or not. A free weekend or a lowered price definitely needed for ""the casual"" players to try this out.And yes, the price. It's quite high for a game that ""lacks content"". True! But the developers will add more and more and it will be more diverse, especially if we'll have a bigger community to play with. I bet they're not going to stop right here, when they're halfway through the marathon.The development also seem a bit slow. Maybe they'll release everything at once, and that's why it takes so long? I don't know. However I'm not a programmer, I don't know how hard it is to create a game and new contents so I'm not judging.The early access misses some really needed content, like tutorials. Of course, there's an online ""How to play"" article which can be found on the official website but who reads that. It would be a really good idea to read it, though... :D You might not know what those things are but after you try those in-game, I'm sure you will figure it out. If not, and you need some advice, most of the skilled players are there to help. We currently have a small playerbase and we surely don't want to lose it because of some confusing game elements.But the core of the game has been layed down for a while now. It's lovely, it's simple and yet so fun if you get a hang of it. Of course you are going to get a bit frustrated if you get knocked out like 10 times in a match because you weren't fast enough with the ball, but as you progress these frustrations will be gone and you start enjoying the game (like I did). You start feeling that you can do better, whatever happened can be done in a different (and better) way even if it was your fault. You'll watch out for it next time. And who knows, maybe you'll score that winning goal or you save a last second shot in a tight match. ^_^Even though there's a few cons about this game and can be considered risky, I definitely recommend this game if you like what you see.EDIT: Fixed some grammar mistakes ( I hope xD ). Thanks for the heads up. o/			"

+ The gameplay is a lot of fun. It's similar to Soccer, yet instead of kicking the ball you are shooting the ball out of a energy cannon or deflecting it with a shield. You are able to charge up your shots to shoot faster, and can do a variety of skillful passes and trickshots to make the goals. + Visually the game looks great with some very nicely detailed graphics, lighting, and partical effects+ Loads of various maps to play on with unique themes and sizes+ The tutorial stage does a wonderful job of teaches you how to play in a interactive fun way. One of the best tutorials I've seen from a game.+ Fast paced and exciting. It can feel very rewarding to launch a curve ball across the map and score a goal. This game is in Early Access so don't take these too seriously- Most of the populated servers seem to be EU based (or at least from what i've seen) which seemed to give me lag / very high ping. - I had issues with some of the controls. For example, right click allows you to scoop up or grab the ball from a distance, but at the same time right click also launches the ball. The problem with this is that your character will auto-pickup the ball if it touches you, so when a player passes the ball to you, you may think to right click to grab it, but you end up mistakingly launching the ball. When you are a goalie, you can press shift to dash back and fourth, and ctrl to put up a shield. The problem with this is that it's hard to press shift and ctrl quickly to move and deflect a ball.- High Skill Gap / Learning Curve.... this game requires a LOT of practice, and tutorial videos if you want to get good. Unfortunetely as a noob, I experienced players wanting to kick me due to lack of experience. - No bots, this is bad because if no one is online you can't play the game at all. You also don't have any way to practice to get better unless you can somehow find players of similar skill level. "

Even the ""Pros"" and Devs have no problem playing with newbs and giving tips to improve. Yes even the Devs play this game on a regular basis and its not a rare occasion that they end up in your game :)Other than many different Early-Access games i did NOT have any performance issues or bugs that hindered my fun in any way.10 / 10 cause the only Problem right now is the small playerbase but thats not something u can blame the Devs for :)			"

								""Easy to learn, hard to master"" - this is what describes it best. You definitely need to give this game time to figure out how it is properly played. It might take a while, but it is worth it. After that you propably don't want to play anything else anymore. It's addicting. It's unique. I have played this game nearly half of my life (started with the Deathball Mod - and still haven't mastered it) and I just can't stop playing it. Haven't found anything that would entertain me as much. It is great to play with your friends and the possibilities and tactics are endless. No game is like the last. To succeed as a team, play as a team - boost and pass each other. 10/10 will definitely waste my time with Supraball again and again			"

								OK, the game is funny, even if it is far to be complete at time of writing. If discounted is surely valuable. At full price it could be valuable if you are gonna play it with a couple of friends. It does not matter if you are a fun of soccer/football/whatever game with balls, you will probably enjoy it, especially if played with friends.What the game needs at time of writing:Better GUI.More comprehensible training/tutorial.Different game modes (eg: more arcade, more strict rules, more player with huge maps, less player with small maps, etc... those are just some ideas)			"

								This game is marvelous and needs more attention from the players on steam! The skill ceiling is off the roof for the start of my review. If you have a tight buddy group of 5 or more just buy it eyes closed you will have a sh.. load of fun for sure. And the ""Masters of Gravity"" will give your eyes a feast. I mean like 360 swirling volley shots is the best :oPros:-Hell of a fun-Learning the game mechanics is not hard at all but its hard to master.-Great graphics/effects/movement for this kind of a game-Sound design is marvelous-Matches are long but you will not understand when its finished cause its fast paced-No bugs as far as I've seen-Great Training Rooms for understanding the basic/medium/hard moves-And the secret :>Cons: (I assume these will go away till the game is released)-Player base is not big (yet) therefore the que times a bit long. (BUT it will be shortened when the game is recognized for sure)-MM is not that good right now because I'm a fresh blood and im matching with ""MoG"" (and again I'm saying YET)-The knockout mechanic is good but the time you are knocked out is a bit long imo (YET again :P)-Connected to the knockout mechanic the ""hit punch"" from the hits are too disorienting for the new players ( and YET again)This is my honest review right now and the Dev. is a gentlemen for sure he did not let any of my questions unanswered.

								It's literally football/soccer, but without the dribbling. I've only played an hour so far, but I can tell you I love it. It has the same feel and speed of the real thing.  You can do things like put topspin or slice on the ball, alter the power of your shots, and pass it to other players with ease. It's a little lacking in terms of UI and polish, and there's not a real tutorial to speak of, but the game feels great and is satisfying to play.  "

								Considering there aren't many actual reviews for the game yet and it's averaging around 70 players, I thought I'd add my review to maybe persuade you into buying Supraball. Before I start the review, please know that I am one of the players that have played the game since the beta with the old launcher, so I have a few more hours than steam says I've logged.What is it? As you can tell, Supraball is an eSport game that is soccer with guns. You have 4 jumps which you can use to get around, and have a gun that can shoot your ball, pass it to other teammates, or shield the ball. There are 4 positions to be played, Goalkeeper, Defender (Center Back), Midfielder, and Offense (Striker). Why should I buy and play it?Supraball is a game that is easy to pick up and play! The skill floor isn't high at all, and I've been in servers with many newer players just having fun! If you're looking for a casual game to play with your friends, pick it up and join a practice server and play away! Supraball is also a game with a high skill cap. If you're looking for harder competitive play, there are ranked matches with people that really know the mechanics and how to play the game. Whether you're a more casual or hardcore gamer, this game is for you either way!Not many people are playing it right now - Will I find a match?Yes! I've been on Supraball with as low as only 20 players and with the server browser and matchmaking, I've still been able to join matches as a substitute and found practice matches that were going on.  The community is a friendly one that is most likely willing to teach you and help you learn from any mistakes you make, so don't be afraid to go in there and, have fun, and try your best!--Supraball Review--			"

								This game is amazing after only 3 games played! I enjoyed each and every single moment in-game. Even if I lost, the experience of playing was amazing. Even if I wasn't familiar to the game, I got hooked right away, as I am a huge football/soccer fan. The stickmen were the comedic relief, such as when they got knocked out or their HP ran out. That gave me a laugh. A good laugh, indeed. 10/10~ FabeGabe "

								I only got this game last night, but im loving it. I can see this becoming a really big game with more people teaming up and together. Once you understand the concept of the game and know how to move around the court, its really a great idea for a game. Pros: Great team game         Will only get better         Challenging Cons: Still being worked on (but all games are these days)          controls and game play can be tricky to learn          Its better if you have people you know to play with and can communicate withOverall a great game and I can't wait to play it more with friends.

								I have been playing this game for 2 years since it has been in development, and I still look forward to spending hours playing after I get home from work. I have made some awesome friends, and some great memories. I have played in tournaments, ranked matches, and just messed around on a public server. All 3 totally different experiences with this game, and all equally enjoyable. Some matches end with my palms sweaty, my heart pacing, and my armpits soaked. Nothing I have ever played before has matched this intensity. This game can be really fast if you have the right group of experienced players. If you love sports, and are competitive in nature, this game is for you. You have the ability to create teams, particiapte in tournaments, build up your rank and stats, and become a legendary goalie, defender, or midfielder that others will look up to. There's just so much to say about this game, that I can't even begin to explain it.  If you're interested in the least bit, take a chance on this game, I highly doubt that you will regret it.I hope to see you on the pitch!			"

								This game has a lot of promise.  It's very fast paced, very intense, and very easy to pick up and put down.  Game servers can set the match length, so if it runs a little long for you find a smaller time server.  The game is super fast paced, and kickoffs happen just right after another to keep the action and intensity going.  It's a nifty game that would be difficult to master, there's a lot you can do, and team work is key.  It reminds me a lot of Bombing Run from UT2K4 in the way the gun play is handled.  When you have the ball you can charge a shot to make it go farther, and you get points for shooting it in the net, can't run it in like in Bombing Run.However this game has a key difference in which you can apply all sorts of spin to the ball, and knock other players out.  The spin is applied by hitting Q or E while charing a shot, this gives it air rotation.  If while charing a shot you tap RMB and then Q or E you'll apply spin on the ball when it lands on the ground.  This is useful for getting the ball to your teammates and past goalies.  Combine all that with the fact that you can quad jump and you have a crazy fast-paced indoor soccer arena.The announcer gets super hyped, and games are easy to get in and out of.The second thing to note is the community is not fun to play with sometimes.  However on the same note it's a team based game.  You should try to play with people you know and trust rather than randoms online who may scored on their own goal repeatedly or continuously say nasty things to you.  There's a report button if you need it!Supraball's developers recently changed the XP distribution lately and now defenders and keepers get more points than attackers - of course only if you actually save stuff. A save can get you 25 points, a goal only 20.  So each position is highly valued in the eye of progression and rank.  You don't need to be a striker to stay competitive, goalies are loved as well.

								The setting up expierience was tedious, but that can be easily fixed. Maybe a startup and setup screen like Rocket League has would make it better, since it is completely clean and easy to use. Also, since this game is really closely related to it. The game itself is one of my favorite first time expieriences in a while, the cartoon characters also make it amazing! I like how the game design doesn't go towards a more realistic look, the cartoon look works really well! Overally this game has a 8/10 from me, the startup and setup screen being seperate from the actual game is not really clean in my opinion.			"

								The best game, I have ever played.The competive level of this game of this game, is endless. The skill sealing is almost for nobody reachable, everyday new tactics are designed, new players steal the spot. I think it's the best competive game I have ever played, the game itself is easy,  but once you get into high ranked matches and cordinated team battles. You have to be creative, Supraball is not nicessary about how good you are. The brain is the more important then your skill. Yes it helps having good mechincs, but teamplay is  the key to win. Looking at the years I have been playing Supraball, I have been so satisfied or mad when I win or lose a game.Give the game a chance,please we are in desperate need for new players that stick around. The veterans love to help new players. So come make a visit :D.Sincerly,Luc. A pre-alpha and beta test player.			"

This an early access reviewIn my opinion the concept of the game is pretty awesome.It's a football game that sets you in first-person perspective.Maybe you think that is like any other football game but it isn't.It's and unique experience.Basically you have a gun that can take the ball and throw it to another player from your team and you can also push your enemys with it(sometimes this causes a fault).Another thing is that you have boost in your legs.This helps you to jump and get the ball.If and ONLY if(I say that because sometimes devs stop developing their games or make it worse)they continue to develop this game in the good way it will become a must have in the gaming community.And i hope so cause there aren't enought players and it's hard to find some matches.

								The pros are too pro. The noobs are too noob. Cannot get into a practice match where there are no pros around (players that are playing this game from a long time back) so that I could try new stuff out without everyone wanting me to pass the ball to the pro so that we can win the match. I know, I know passing the ball is good - but for me I will miss OR the goalkeeper will catch the ball (or sheild it) because of my poor shot. BUT I AM LEARNING! As for the pro its a 80-95% chance to make a goal. So I'll never learn unless I want to lose the match so I have to pass the ball or he vote kicks me and all agree with him just so they can just win the match being in the background with their sheilds up next to the goal ready to pass the ball to the pro. :/This game is good but they need to add a kiddie pool for newbies (Away from all the pros!). The difference can be made by the XP/Lvl of the player.			"

								[ENG] Enough interesting idea, and dynamic gameplay. All is not even bad. The game itself I liked, and especially it would have liked the fans of non-standard football. The graphics pleasing for the eye. Sounds quite good. Of the minuses, I note the absence of a balance, because strong players can get to you, at a time when you are a beginner who is trying to master the game. Still I have a problem with optimization. As the game continues to evolve and find their fans, i hope this problem will fixed.[RU] Достаточно интересная задумка, и динамичный геймплей. Всё очень даже не плохо. Сама игра мне понравилась, а особенно она бы понравилась любителям нестандартного футбола. Графика приятная глазу. Звуки достаточно неплохие. Из минусов, я могу отметить отсутствие баланса, так как к тебе может забросить очень сильных игроков, в то время когда ты новичок который осваивается в игре. Ещё у меня возникли проблемы с оптимизацией, но надеюсь над этим ещё поработают. Так как игра продолжает развиваться и находит своих фанатов.			"

								Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordIm not really a Fan of Football games. I dont like Fifa or any other kind of ""real"" football game.I played Rocket League which is a pretty good game, but Supraball tops it imo.I've only spent ~50 Hours playing it so far, im still being pretty bad at the game.-GraphicsWell, graphics dont really matter that much in Supraball, its amazing though. I like the design of the Characters, the Menu, they put so much effort into detail on different maps, its just amazing.As i just said, the game is not really about graphics though.-GameplayI really like the gameplay so far, its not really getting boring or anything.The only thing i hate so far are beginners not passing the ball.There is a Training Course (which everyone should play), Online Practice, Regular Matches and Ranked Matches. You require 2500 XP to play ranked which you usally get in 1-3 days, depending on how much you play. XP dont get you anything besides the possibility to play ranked so far, but the game is still in Early Access, so i really think it will be more rewarding in the future.There is not much to say about the gameplay really, its just amazing, you should definetly check it out by yourself!-SoundsThe Sounds in Supraball are just amazing in every way.I especially like the sound the figures make when shooting a goal ^^-ControlsAbout the Controls, they are easy to learn, but hard to master.Its pretty easy for beginners, everything is getting explained to you in the Tutorial.The Tutorial isnt a boring one with some deep Voice talking to you, its just a Practice Course with different Objectives, reaching from Easy to Hard. Even though the game tells you it may take 7 days to learn all of the mechanics, its pretty much done in a few hours. I spent ~3 Hours to complete the course.You can leave anytime and continue where you quit though.-QualityI didnt find any bugs so far, the game looks insanely good though. The Animations are great, just as the graphics and the sounds are. Definetly high quality.-Overall ExperienceMy Overall experience was pretty good. I didnt expect the game to be that good.I got it for free, so my expectations were low, but that game... Its just insanely good.I'm a huge fan of competitive games, so that may be the reason for me loving it.I seriously recommend this game to anyone, from any age.If Steam would finally start to accept star-based ratings, the game would definetly get 5/5.

								I am new to the game, and only 4 hours in as of this review. I get absolutely spanked most games, but I don't rage quit. Instead I strive to be better, so that I can be the spanker someday. Obviously there are veterans on here that have played much longer than most people, so expect to get tag teamed by gorillas every now and then until you hone your skills in a practice server. Don't be salty about losing, because you will adapt overtime and become a more adept player. You have to work as a team, and you have to have fast reflexes. The movement is like that of Unreal Tournament, so 12 year olds be damned. You can strafe dash left and right, and you can quad jump in the air, which is incredibly useful in avoiding a nice kick to the face. You can put a backspin, front spin, or a side spin on the ball, which confuses even the most hardened gods sometimes. Passing is easy too, but it's also very easy to intercept as well, so git gud. All in all, it's a great game with some relation to Rocket League, but don't call it a Rocket League rip off, because this came out before it. See you on the field fam.			"

								The game in it's core is a great and fun idea; however, the execution by the devs is pure because of their unproffesionalism and unexperience regarding game development. Personally, I've played this game for 2 years, and have spent many countless hours in it, and enjoyed a good half of it. I'd give this game a chance if you're into competitive, skill dependent games and you have the patience to wait for things to come in order development wise.			"

								I was shown this game by a youtuber named Simon or Miniminter. It looked really simple because of the way they played it so I decided to pick it up. This game is one of the most skill capped things and it is absolutely fantastic. The only problems I see with it right now are the amount of players and the Dev support. This game is starting to host tournaments every month which is great. I think it's a really good idea, but there are a lot of downsides too. The amount of players for NA is very small. Sometimes there are around 15 people, and other times there are only 2 or 3. The new player experience is basically someone joins the game with friends and starts to play, then they will quickly find out that it's not as simple as you think. Then a little bit of time goes by and they start to go against other players and learn that there are people that have over 4000 hours in this game and will absolutely crap on new people. The pub stomping in this is just a bit too much to handle sometimes. If you actually read to the end of this review then I thank you. I do recommend this game. The somewhat of a community it has is all great  Expect Mikeytroll. Just kick him when he joins ;)  MAKE SURE TO PLAY THE TUTORIAL. SHOW THE VETERAN PLAYERS THAT YOU CAN LEARN TO PLAY			"

People are not selfish, teamwork is great and you can have fun chatting with your mates or the enemy while scoring some sick shots. 10/10 would recommend it to anyone. Either you want to chill or just wreck the enemy and do some trick shots this game is perfect for you. Give it a try, you won't regret it.			"

								All the time I spent playing this game it was always fun but never the same. In the beginning it's messing around on the pitch, learning controls, scoring your first goals, catch some balls as a keeper.Then it's like learning volleys and improving precision, then getting better reflexes in goal.Then a deep dive into teamplay and tactics, forming a team with friends and playing matches against other teams.Then it's becoming creative and using the means you have to create ever new plays, juke defenders and keepers.Then it's participating in a community league and getting to the top of the ladder.Then it's winning a close yet so important game by your hands last second.Lastly it's being carried away in ecstasy.No regrets, perfect 5/7!

								I've played Supraball for about 3 years now. I'd say I probably spent ~1500 hours with it on the steam version and the versions before it. I can't recommend the game in its current state to anyone. Small playerbase (especially in north america) means you MAY get one game in a day if you're lucky. The dedicated community has all left, minus a few who still have hope. Devs should sell the game to a company with more resources. The actual gameplay is the same it's been for nearly 2 years. They've spent, somewhere around, the last year making the lobby system which, in its current state, is the last thing the game needs right now. At least they made a tutorial. But you won't be able to use the skills honed in tutorial in actual matches barely anyone plays the game anymore.			"

								if you are looking for a fun and competitive game at the same time to play with friends, you can not find any better. The idea of the game is really innovative and very well made, with intuitive and simple controls, which generate a very fast and fun gameplay. The competitiveness is the strong point of this game, in fact you can do online matches where you try to win by using your and your team skill and strategies.The graphics is very clean, pleasant and light. This makes the gameplay not stressful and without lag that can annoy.I found no bugs in my first few hours and I am very satisfied.Ultimately I hope that one day this game can go up to the levels of famous competitive online games, with international tournaments.So I highly recommend it if you are looking for a competitive and fun game to play with friends.

								This game is very enjoyable for those who like fps, but want something which doesn't nessesserily involve killing, more killing, and maybe even some objective play. In this game, you play football/handball from an fps camera view. I say bot football and handball because is half of each. I love this game to bits and higly recommend for anyone who wants to try something new and fun. This game also has a very competetive standpoint if you are a competetive player. Still very early access, so there are boudt to be glitches, and there are, but if you look away from that, it has much potential to become an amazing game. They are working on plentyfull of new updates as i am writing this, but as of right now, there are not many working on the game.			"

								This game is amazing. Filled with many fun gimmicks, I wont get too far into it, you need to check it out, but I have found one problem with the game so far. No one is ever on, so gaining the 2.5k xp needed to even be able to get into ranked which is were it seems most of the people who are even on play, is seemingly impossible. I dont understand how these people got into ranked because when I go to play the game I look over the server browser and there is one server filled at the most. When I join that server and we are in fact able to get in game and start a full one, everyone leaves after that one game and go disperse around the other servers.Basically I'm saying the ranked xp cap needs to be lowered. For the amount of ready servers you don't find, and for the fact that you earn less than 200 xp every match, it feels like there's just way too much getting in the way. I wouldn't normally say a game should lower their ranked cap, but for a game with as little constant players as this I really think it should.Overall though with the fact that you can curve the ball in any direction so much so that you can even change the axis of the spin, being able to use 5 jumps that reset everytime you hit the ground, and so many different ways to hit or shoot the ball to cover so many playstyles, this game has a lot of potential.

								It looks cool and has nice playability. Shame you play with people that doesn't know to play in team. They just look to the goal and always try to score by themselves like they are playing 1v3 or 1v5. It's really sad. And that kind of attitude throws me off of games like this one, that are really promising but the comunity is just sad.If you don't really care about the other players, go ahead and try the game. If not, don't buy it, because you'll have to chase the ball like a dog to be able to shoot it or pass - if you're a team player like me - to your team mates.			"

								This game looks promising but in its current state, I can't recommend it. All I got to play were some practice courses. After I finished those I went to play a few matches against bots to get better at the game before I play online. Turns out there are no bot matches. I decided to play online but there were only 12 people in servers, and not enough in one server to fill it. It might be fun if there were bots to play against or if there were people who actually play the game, but there's not. Also, the devs said they don't have plans to add bots.			"

Early Access Review
								Aesthetically weak and uninspired, unoptimized, stagnant, feature-starved. These are just a few descriptors that I feel accurately represent the state of Supraball. When buying a new game, I am often curious as to what creative energy went into bringing it to fruition. Supraball is a downgrade from the original mod in terms of art direction. This being the case primarily because Deathball used UT2K4 assets. Deathball had hundreds of user-created maps, a plethora of player models, replays, pausing, and in-game ready system, a more sophisticated kickoff system, better in-game stat tracking, and more gameplay variety. A UT2K4 mod, that had been in development for two years, had far more going on for it feature-wise than a standalone game that has, according to the dev team, been “in the works” for four years. Being a programmer, I understand the challenges behind creating something like this. However, the dev team chose to price the game at $20. Rocket League also costs $20. Rocket League is far ahead of Supraball in almost every area one could think of, and the dev team has invited this comparison via their pricing decision. Gameplay-wise, Supraball is nearly the perfect type of game for me. That I cannot recommend it to most gamers should be a red flag. If you put in the time, a high-level game of Supraball can be more interesting and enjoyable than perhaps any other game I’ve played. It’s that you have to look past the poor art direction, underdeveloped visuals, missing features, nonsensical rank and lobby system, and the very steep learning curve (assuming you want to play in the higher-level games, which is where Supraball becomes far more interesting). In the hands of the right dev team, this type of game could be very successful, as you’ve seen with something like Rocket League. The Rocket League dev team listens to their community, has been a lot of creative energy into their game, and seems to generally “get it”. I cannot say the same for Supraball’s dev team. If you’re looking for something similar to Rocket League in concept, that gives you more control over what’s going on, and has, in my opinion, superior overall gameplay, buy Supraball. Just know that there are several glaring things that you must overlook, and I don’t feel that the vast majority of players are willing to or should have to. If you’re buying this game based on an expectation that it will continue to evolve, don’t. If the game were priced under $10 USD, I feel it would be easier for me to recommend. At $20… No.			"

It's not possible to edit this option,really don't know..The default command list is something that can not be stood.Default sensitivity and pass/catch/shoot commands at first.Tutorial mini-games are there just to make you nervous,the ball does not follow the same trajectory even if you are in the SAME place,giving the SAME spin and the SAME power.I've waited for this game be on sale and I bought it at €1.99 (instead of €9.99),but it isn't even worth these money.Refund 10/10.Edit: Yes,I know it is an Early Access.

								Game is almost completely dead which is why I can't recommend it even for $4 dollars. Really cool to watch high level players do crazy ♥♥♥♥ with the ball. You'll almost never find a game so you won't see it often. That being said if this game gained popularity it would be a lot of fun to mess around with. I don't see that happening because of Rocket League. If you want a game in the same world as this i'd highly recommend you pick that up. 850+ hours should speak on it's own. Both games have a huge skill ceiling that rewards practice. On top of that I'd easily pay $40-50 dollars for Rocket league and it's orginal price is only half of that.			"

								Do you want to catch a ball? Yes? Then go fu** yourself! Now we added trash gun that don't let you do anything! There are even veteran players that throw crap on you everytime when you try to do something! But hey, you can practice with other new players that are AFK or troll most of the time!Buy now for this rigged price! Only 9,99€ for 20 FPS and empty servers!kill me "

								EDIT: One of the developers added me on Steam to get some input from me and he was actually quite a nice guy. He took on board my thoughts, put in a bug request from an issue I had and really professional the whole time. I will probably try the game again on a free weekend in the future.I'm not really sure how this game has been in development since 2012. The launcher is horrible, the graphics could be beaten by a flash game and it is all basically an eyesore.I know a lot of people really seem to like the game but I just can't understand the hype. The game was boring, felt clunky and didn't feel worth the £11 or so I paid for it.I know somebody is going to say ""Oh, but it's in Early Access!!1!"".. It's been in development for 4 years, critism is completely valid.			"

								Umm, don't buy it. It isn't too hard to find servers with people in, and the graphics are very good. But, I don't know, it is sorta like rocket league (which I could recommend over this).			"

								handball on steroids = Supraballinstead of russians u get italians :)---------------------------------------------------------------------fun game, but needs improvements to be more awesome and more succesful,especially the esport aspect of the game.it has huge potential to be the next esport gamemy suggestions-remove headbob-remove splash/dirt effects on screen-option to disable DoF in the settings-Should be more quake-like controls/ gravity while jumping.This halo type jumping is a bad choice.-add statistics to the game,(number of goals,cathes/saves by goal keeper,passes etc..) ingame to be displayed (for spectator mode as well)-planned feature:""Real matchmaking including queuing with 1 or 2 of your friends""do not add this to the game, this only cause frustrations and unbalance.Atleast not for ranked.playing a match with 9 random guy is fun, playing 5v5/3v3 premade is fun too.playing with 2-3 premades in 5v5/3v3 is very frustrating and allways breaks the gamedont do the same mistake what other developers did, dont make the game frustrating to play pls.-wallbouncing behind the goal keeper: this is totally unfair and makes the game way too stupid

between the 2 yellow lines on the picture, the ball should be out, and the goal keeper should get a free kick.this change will make the game more skillful and more balanced			"

								So this game has so many bugs into it, it's not really big at all and I really understand why. It's just not that fun of a game, nothing I would really be occupied for a long time by. It just isn't the kind of game you want to play with friends because they will turn against you almost insantly.			"

								This game might be fun if it was geared more toward casual gamers, but it's really not like that. The game is overrun with people that ruin the experience for all newcomers. Also, it looks horrible and plays pretty bad. Kinda slow paced, very unremarkable. I was thinking similar to rocket league... not even close. NOT WORTH $15... maybe worth $4.			"

								Really fun, but unplayable due to lack of players. I mean playing on the 600 ping EU servers if fun.			"

								NOW I really recommend this game! With the latest update developers added skins ( shirts, hats etc.. ) and bots! This means that it's possible to play at anytime. And I the AI is really well done!  "

								Got this game for free. I'm not too sure if it's worth the price, but overall, the game is pretty decent and is way better than I expected.			"

								It would be cool, if you could actually play online. There are servers but they are all empty and it's just no fun. I definetly do not recommend buying this game until it's finished and more people play it.			"

								I haven't learned a lot yet but i'm having a very good time playing this game.The tutorial and the videos introduce yourself in the game pretty well but actually there aren't a lot of active players, so finding a match requires time.I've received it for free but i think it's worth the sale's price.

								So far, the game seems pretty cool; the movement is fluid, the gameplay (from what I've gathered from the tutorials) is really cool and unique, and there's a nice learning curve to it. However, there aren't many players online right now. The custom server browser section has 0 players on any of the servers. I really hope more people play this game. It has a lot of potential.			"
