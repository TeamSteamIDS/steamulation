												Not a fan of table tennis but this game is not bad. A little bit difficult for me though. Would be better if I can change the AI's appearance.			"

								This is an amazing VR table tennis game! The physics is good and you can have fun in different modes. Would be better if PVP added.			"

												I won't ask for a refund because I understand that this is an Early Access title but this game really need more work. The graphics are cool, I really appreciate to be able to change the ingame music by pressing left & right on the controller pad, but the road will be long to compete with others Ping Pong titles already availables.I suggest the author to follow another way by making a fantasy Ping Pong game, with power-ups and different kinds of AI opponents to challenge. Mario & Sonic Table Tennis or Pink Pong are good examples...			"

Early Access Review
								It's a ping pong game. It is not easy as most are not for me at least and my wife was having trouble as well. Weightless balls are never easy to handle are they? I didn't see anything wrong with the game when my wife was playing so I say this is worth a try if you like these kinds of games. Enjoy.Video below will be viewable after YouTube processes it. HD Will be ready soon after.

								Whack-a-mole is interesting, and hope there would be e graphical improvement. Practice and quickmatch mode are a little bit similar just points are counted in different way.			"
