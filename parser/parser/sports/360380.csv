""Cheese hungry mice in a 'World of Goo' bridge builder clone""First I was looking forward to play this game. I got it when it was reduced by 98% to 0.21 EUR. After playing the first levels I feel about this is not really a creative new concept of bridge builder game. Rather it's the same old overtaken principle of 'World of Goo': to build as less as possible triangles to reach a goal. The game proclaims to be very ""challenging"". But in the end you have the same problem like in 'World of Goo': There's only one perfect solution (OCD) to reach the 3 stars goal. Why to repeat the old mistakes I wonder. Couldn't it be a funny, not so challenging physics bridge builder game? But apparently the overstimulated kids from today love to sit hours over simple graphics to find the adequate angle solution that their bridges bendover in the right moment. Sigh ! Where is the fun in this?At least you have a hint option which refills for one hint / 10-15 min. Seems you have to ""hint grind"" through each level to unlock the ""collect every star"" achievement.PS. And the leaderboards are also pointless if you have just ppl doing ""hint solutions"".			"

												It's important to note that this review is based off the PC version of the game.Sometimes an App needs to just stay out of the PC market, and stay as an App. This is the only thing I could think of during my time with Ratventure Challenge. The games genre is a simple one, build a bridge and get object A to point B. There are many of this type of these games in the genre, I haven't really played many of them. Names like Bridge Constructor, World of Goo, etc, jump to mind, just to name a few. The genre has never really garnered much interest in me, it always seemed rather repetitive. With Ratventure Challenge, I thought it would be a nice, interesting, way to break myself into the genre.For the most part it does the job. The physics of the game can be a little strange and the game has some very odd design decisions, all of which we will be discussing here in this review. So lets start with something obvious. If you noticed at the top of this article, many prices are listed, ranging from five bucks to two bucks. Normally I don't list prices of the game on my blog, because I feel monetary value of a game is different from person to person. However in this case, I wanted to use them as a object point to a particular issue I have with this title. There is NO difference between the three versions of the game. Why is there a price difference? Simply for the pleasure of playing that game on that particular device? Now, I could ramble on about how this all seems shady but I will leave it at that for now.Straight from when you launch the game, Ratventure screams App. There isn't any retooling of options, buttons, or even the way you can interact with the screen. There are absolutely no graphics control or option menus present whatsoever. All you're left with is a sound off/on, music off/on button.The game also is stuck in 1280/720 resolution, if you wanted to play it on full screen, there is no in-game way of doing this currently. For a PC port this is rather disappointing in most regards.Now let's get to the good stuff, the game play. Now if you were to ask me simply, is the game fun? I would say yes, ignoring all the other issues the game has a whole. The game is simple enough to play, with you building small pieces in a massive wooden structure, in hopes of getting some delicious cheese. The puzzles vary in difficulty and sometimes not in order. One level is ridiculously hard and then the next will be rather easy. I think this issue has to do with the fact that Ratventure doesn't really evolve all too much as a game. There are buzz-saws and rope hooks to change things up occasionally, but for the most part your building pieces never evolve or change.Level designs are varied enough as you progress deeper into the games 72 levels and some of them can be quite the brain tickler. To help you along is a handy hint button that does a fairly good job of showing how to do it in the 3 star requirement. However, it doesn't let you do it step by step more then it shows it all at once and expects you to remember, this is probably done on purpose as it would be too easy otherwise. The game also features a useful ""Undo last action button"" that doesn't really work at all. The button only lets you undo the last action and sometimes not at all depending on what happens in the game. The game is full of these strange little inconveniences. As an example, if either of the rats die by some means, either falling or buzz-saw, you have to rebuild your entire structure over again, instead of just simply hitting the undo button.Why have this button at all?Designing structures isn't too difficult. The game does respond quite rapidly to commands and the structure dynamically responds to the changes you make. If one side of the structure is built upon too much, it begins to sag or bend. If the rats jump on the structure, the structure responds to the sudden shift in weight. Keeping the aforementioned effects in mind, works rather well and lets you plan out your moves quite effectively. One thing that did annoy me quite a bit about the game though, was the fact that the rats won't go after the cheese even if it's in their faces. You have got to build the structure on top of the cheese and move them to it. The rats are stupid, and won't walk on grass.Aesthetically speaking, Ratventure is just fine. The levels mostly change in color and the backdrop. Ratventure isn't certainly the most pretty of games but it isn't the ugliest as well, it gets the job done. I would have enjoyed a little bit of personality injected into the game. When the rats hit the buzz-saws they simply just fall off the screen. There could've been some added humor with them being ripped to bits or a funny sound effect. The game is just very monotone from beginning to end. Musically I felt the same about the game, while it never became grating on my ears, I never really noticed it or felt it was pleasant.There is no story nor sense of personality to this game. You just hit the play button and that is simply it. No little cut scenes or images to explain anything. The game does offer a fair bit of replay value in chasing down the mystical 3 star achievement. There really isn't much of a reason to do this, no rewards or anything unlocked other then steam achievements, you just did it. Congratulations.So you may be thinking I am coming off a bit harsh on this game? Keep in mind this was on the PC. I hold my PC games to a higher degree/standard and demand a bit more out of them. App games have the right to be simple on their platform, given the limitations of that platform. I would've probably been more than okay with all the issues and aspects to the game, had I played it on my phone or pad. However, the developer felt the need to make this PC port that is uninspiring and not very well done. Is the game fun? Yes. But is it worth it on PC? No. Get this game on your phone or pad, it's cheaper and you will probably enjoy it more as something to pass the time at the DMV.I only recommend this title, if its on sale, you really love bridge construction games, and know what you're getting. Otherwise buy it on your phone only!			"

												Ratventure Challenge follows 2 rats on their lifelong ambition to collect cheese. If you are familiar with physics-based bridge builders like World of Goo you should know what to expect. Six distinct worlds await, all containing 12 levels. Difficulty gradually increases either by giving you fewer blocks, asking for larger towers to be constructed or by placing more obstacles in your way.

It's a shame to have to down vote on the basis of in-game transactions link. Because the simulation itself is quite good, as are the controls. While not required to progress generally both steam users and valve frown upon such things and they really have no place in full priced pc games.  Other downside would be the lack of in-game options, Music had no volume slider so it was either on or off and couldn't run in full screen, was locked to a window @1280x768.  Perhaps a little on the easy side I've not progressed far enough to make final judgement. With the in-game transactions removed and some video options added, I would give it the thumbsup as otherwise the price is about right and game is quite enjoyable. Cheers folks. :)EDIT:In-game purchases were completely removed by request. While the game still lacks video options it's not worth completely overlooking if you enjoy playing with physics or puzzle games. Developer has also apologized for the over-reaction and community banning me for no reason, these things happen.  Happy Gaming!			"

												What do you get when you take elements of Transformice, World of Goo, and Poly Bridge (all of which being far better than this), throw them in a blender, and hit liquify? What you should have is a big mess, and that's exactly what you get with Tiny Bridge: Ratventure.First off, this is quite obviously a mobile port. I was first suspicious from the startup resolution, which is locked at 1280x768. A 16:10 resolution, and a failry odd one at that. ""Any options to change it or go fullscreen?"" You're kidding right? The options are almost non-existent, with your only real options being turning the sounds and music on or off. Not up or down, on or off. There's also a button on the main menu that gives a bare-bones tutorial, but we'll get to gameplay in a bit.Your goal is to get your two mice to collect the glowing cheeses by making a bridge, and using as few pieces as possible to do it. One interesting thing I will give this game is that you're supposed to use your mice as counterweights to help balance the bridge in question. ""Wait, aren't bridges supposed to be stable?"" Nevermind that for now! But yes. Sounds cool, right? You get to not only guide your mice to their goal, but make them be PART of the puzzle? Indeed, it does… it SOUNDS cool. Then you play it. And where do I even begin with the gameplay?First, if you want a three-star, perfect level, there's literally only one way to do it: the way the hint button tell you to, and verbatum at that. If you deviate by any considerable margin or try to do it your own way, you won't get the perfect finish. Even if you collect all the optional cheeses and use less than half the parts given to you, you'll likely only get two stars, max. The hint button also makes the leaderboards moot, as everyone can just use the hints to achieve the perfect score (and many of the achievments if they have the patience).Speaking of collection, there's a serious problem with hitboxes. Just look up screencaps of this game and you'll see that sometimes the mice will literally be touching the cheese but will refuse to collect it. ""Just reach out and grab it, you lazy cusses! D=<"" No, they have to be directly on top of it for it to count, and getting them to do that is a lot harder than it sounds.While on the subject of lazy mice, sometimes the tall thin one will refuse to move along with the short fat one, making me wonder if there's something wrong with me or if it's the game. Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, how do I fix it?Then there's the physics. Yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, they're not good, which is a real bad thing considering this is a bridge building game at heart. They're inconsistent, so much so that I've done the same thing several times in the same level and gotten different results. Tiny Bridge, you are not Bad Rats. Don't be like that.To summarize, do you remember those three games I listed up at the top of the review? Play those instead. Yes, even Transformice.			"

 About Tiny Bridge: RatventureThis mind-bending game will challenge you to create complex structures to get your woodland creatures over vast chasms. In a bridge-builder first, you'll guide your creatures and construct your bridges in real time. Use the weight of various creatures to balance your structures as you build them. Release Date: 8 May, 2015The Story You are the bridge builder helping two Rats get cheeze. It's probably the story of the century, lets be honest here. World of Goo didn't have much of a story either, but they had some existential thing going on in the background at least. I could weave a crazy story about how Top-Hat-Mouse is an entrepreneur that is venturing with his friend stocking-hat-mouse to invest in the cheese market.The GameplayThe gameplay is straightforward, but agonizingly difficult at the same time. You put down points to create a bridge for your mice to run across to get cheese. At that description alone someone could easily say ""okay, why don't I just play world of Goo instead? What does this game do differently?You can tell your mice where to go, and THAT actually goes way farther then you might at first thing. This means you can control where the weight goes before hand; unlike in world of Goo where the goo simply goes to the closest point to the end goal.All in All  Tiny Bridge: Ratventure is a good Simulation Game!9/10 From Me Sweep "

												Update: The developer was very responsive, and pushed an update shortly after I delivered a crash log. It appears to have fixed the issue.As for the game, it's much like World of Goo and similar tower-building games. I kind of liked it, but I got bored easily.-----It crashes all the time on OS X 10.10.3 due to programming errors involving the undo stack (update: actually, settings) and null pointers.Looks like the programming is pretty awful, or the UI library is awful, or the OS X testing is sub-standard.

Conclusion: I would describe this as an ""Encore"" to World of Goo, but not quite as charming, it was clearly inspired by world of good, and mechanically speaking it's pretty solid. There was just something about this game that didn't quite connect with me. But that's not enough of a reason to give it a negative review, it does what it promises it goes on sale often.If you wanna play a game similar to world of Goo, and have a little money to through at it, it might be worth a pick up.

												Okay, so i'm not normally one to write a review, but this game has been an utter disappointment. It has sat in my installed steam library for a while now and I hated that I had never found the time to try it out.Well I tried it out, and after having to repair the game file i found myself with a tiny box on my screen, not full screen option, no settings of any kind besides the obvious sounds and music on/off switched. So issue one... no full screen, but who really cares, with a cheap boring knock off game that serves little purpose other than to occasionally work, it's the smallest of the issues. Maybe it is just my computer, I just finished playing some Xcom on max graphics though, so I doubt it's the hardware at fault with the game designed to require clever physics and specific timing froze more often that a 10 year old boy trying to talk to his crush. Maybe it was the hype, maybe I got too excited to check out a mediocre game, maybe it just wasn't meant to be, I spent an hour trying to play this game and less than half of that time was spent restarting repeatedly because of the crashing. This game... just... don't bother, not worth the memory used and the cost of the internet to download, even if you have unlimited.			"

												Game looked interesting but it unnecessarily requires you to be pin-point accurate. This discourages players to look for solutions by themselves because there is only one solution to get 3 stars and it has to be done exactly the same way for it to work. Other than that, ive enjoyed this! Its a nice cheap game, that you def get your moneys worthCheap while it is on saleIt has trading cardNice BGMCons :No setting for fullscreen. The game will be played in window mode.Kinda weird where the rats can only moves on bridge only. Sometimes the cheese is lying on the ground, but the rats can't reach it without building additional bridge. Why don't they walk on the ground....Undo is limited to 1 moves only. You can't undo your previous previous move.			"

												An OK mobile port with better options available on the PC.Pros:Tiny Bridge: Ratventure has some things going for it.  It has an attractive art style and a whimsical premise.  It is currently on sale and very cheap.  Cons:Sadly, quite a few cons in this one.- First, it is obviously a mobile port.  There doesn't seem to have been much done in this conversion, including a lack of resolution options.  Sound and music are only toggles.- There is only one solution to three star a level, the solution that you can get by looking at the hints.  This takes away from any creativity that might have been part of the process.  Each level is simply a puzzle with one right solution.  That would be OK if not for....- Sometimes there are bugs.  The thin mouse sometimes gets lost and does not move.  Also, for a physics based game the underlying physics engine does not seem up to the task at times.  Sometimes, despite standing on top of your goal (the cheese), your mice seem unintersted in picking it up.  Maybe because you didn't follow the hint button map exactly.The presentation isn't bad, and if you don't mind a simple puzzle game timewaster with a single solution you can get hints for, this is the game for you.  If you are looking for the next World of Goo, look elsewhere.4/10			"

												When I saw the screenshots of this game I thought hmm I am getting this cause this is reminding me of World of Goo and I loved that game. I was wrong. This game is no way fun like World of Goo, this game is more like frustrating. First when I launched the game I saw it's in windowed mode so I tried going fullscreen with Alt + Enter because I didn't find any settings about this game and that didn't work I spend a few minutes trying to figure it out until I decided to check the Community Hub for this game and come to find out this game doesn't have Full screen mode at all which is frustrating. Then I jump into the game and the mechanics are broken sometimes, like one of the mice will fail to move, sometimes the mice will ignore the cheese completely and sometimes the bridges won't place like you want them. You will end up getting one stars and two stars and not realising what you have to do or why you did get or did not get three stars. Also another thing is that the undo function is broken. Maybe I was hyped too much and it effected my opinion on the game for expecting a game like World of Goo or maybe that's not the case at all and that the game is not good but simply I don't like this game and all it did is get me frustrated at it so I cannot recommend it.

												It's pretty frustrating to be honest. I enjoy a good puzzle game, but the physics are just too janky and the requirements are too precise. So it could have been a fun little game where you build a few different designs and there are a few options on each level, to get creative with. But each one has been built with a very specific solution on mind and because the wooden structures bounce around a lot with movement, sometimes even the exact same design will fail one time but work the next. So to finish the game with 3 stars becomes a grind or trial and error over and over. Anyhow I did it and I'm sure others will be able to as well, but I'd suggest that any other games in the series either tone down the bounciness of the structures or reduce the precision required to navigate the levels and let people come up with designs of their own to solve the problem.I'd say it was a thumbs sideways, but that's not an option, so call it a thumbs down in the hopes that people who want to play this understand that it's not as simple as the art style and gameplay trailer suggest.

												I got this game for next to nothing in a sale, free after selling the cards.. I didn't have high expectations but I was still left feeling really disappointed with it.The biggest problem I had with it is the physics, given that it's a physics game it's a real issue for the game when the main aspect of the game just fails.It feels a bit too ""bouncy"", like the wood is made out of rubber, no matter how much support you add, all your structure/bridge wants to do is wobble, flail around and isn't able to stay firmly in  one place.You can copy a hint, 100% to how it's shown and still not be able to do the level..In most cases the hint shown is the only solution to solve the level. Little creativity can be done; making it really dull.I think the biggest frustration I had with the game and made me abandon it was that if you did a test run and then ended it the contraption doesn't 'pause', it still keeps the same momentum it had before leaving it to break even in construction mode.As it's still able to move during this phase it leaves it being a pain in the ♥♥♥ to build, you can fail before you even start testing it. It's irritating and a buggy mess.There's so many bridge construction games out there which are much better off than this, it had a nice idea but the game is just poorly made.Not worth buying it but you can get it for nothing when it gets a high discount, the bundle it's included in has some nice games though but don't expect any enjoyment from Tiny Bridge: Ratventure.

												While this game doesn't really stand out in the crowd, it is a decent little bridge-builder for less than a dollar. I got it because of the theme. I adore rats and couldn't resist a bridge-builder involving them.+ Plenty of levels to play.+ I never experienced any glitches or bugs.+ Rats.- Minimalistic app-like interface can be disorienting at first.- Some levels seem to depend too much on luck or are a bit obscure as far as the best way to approach them without using the hints.

												Everything about this game is wrong especially when you play on PC.Did you know that mices can't walk on solid ground? Switching between building and walking modes by clicking on icons is so wrong. And it doesn't have fullscreen mode. Never buy Tiny Bridge no matter how cheap it is. Take World of Goo instead.			"

												So I just wasted my money on this disappointing game and stopped playing after 10 minutes. The sound and music is annoying and I needed to turn it off. The whole game feels like a cheap port of a flash game - there isn't even a fullscreen mode (at least I didn't see a settings button). And what about these in-game buy thing?? I paid the full price and you offer me ""moves"" or tips to buy for 10% of the game price - this is ridiculous!I bought this game as I was craving for a continuation of the genius ""World of Goo"", as the mechanics seemed similar from the video. But now I'm just disappointed and ashamed I really ""spent"" money on this game.[Update: The microtransactions/ingame-buy have been removed from the game - so my paragraph about this is now obsolete.]			"

												it's a terrible game, no creativity at all. If I could refund it I would but I got it in a bundle with a game that I did want and do enjoy. I pretty much paid 50 cents for this and it's not even worth that. It's clunky, if a level if badly constructed you can't skip it. It's also got ugly rats :/ I was hoping on this being a casual bridge builder but, it being a children's game you can't even use as many bridge pieces as you want when the game mechanics are failing you (to use an alternative route)it's like a 2/10 maybe. It did give me three trading cards in a fairly short time period *sigh* (that's the only reason I put 30 minutes in it instead of 8)			"

												Tiny Bridge: Ratventure is basically a bridge building game with an active element where you need to move the two rats and gather the cheese pieces as the structure you built swing and stretch based on the weight. It is a puzzle game that has been done before, but usually, the units (lemmings, monkeys, etc.) move on their own logic toward the exit, rather than you controlling it. The idea is to use minimum number of moves and minimum number of segments to build the structure. This is obviously a mobile game port, as the structure is identical to many similar action-puzzle games, including the long-lived Angry Birds franchise, where you have multiple ""stages"", each stage containing a dozen or more levels and you can get up to 3 stars per level. The more stars, the more levels are unlocked. There's not much else to the game though. The trick is in how complicated structure you have to build and how to minimize the steps you have to take to grab all the cheese. As the cheese are further apart and terrain gets trickier, the structures you build start to take on Rube Goldberg machine properties even though they aren't supposed to move... much. If you want a bridge-building game, there are better ones. This is a puzzle game similar to Worlds of Goo where you build structures to reach stuff. It's really nothing special.			"

												Nice puzzle game. Build lopsided towers and bridges to gain more cheese, but beware that you'll need your brains and feeling of balance, and some help from two rats to succeed. What kind of help? Oh, just ask them to stand here and there on your structure to keep it's balance... Play and have fun! 9 of 10			"

												I though this game was a standard bridge building game. It's not.I got this in a bundle, so I didn't see any of the trailers or pictures and whatnot, but I gave it a try. I only lasted for about 15 minutes. The game itself is interesting, but I don't find it very fun to play. The physics in it is a bit wonky, and the ""Bridge building"" aspect is a bit lacking, at best. I wouldn't recommend paying the whole TEN ****ING DOLLARS for this game. I would see a reasonable price for this being $1, as you could just easily turn this into a flash game and put it on newgrounds or a similar site, and make it free.			"

Need a little extra weight one one side of your structure? Move your rats to that area, and then continue building your bridge.The mechanics of the game behave similar to World of Goo.			"

												I got the game on a pack and -90% of its price, and I'm actually glad I didn't buy it before (in my opinion this game isn't worth 10,99€... But as I said, just in my opinion). The idea itself it's good and could be entertaining, however I don't really recommend this game unless you have the greatest patience in the world. I tried a few levels and I just gave up. In the third level, for example, I did the bridge exactly as the ""idea"" said, however the rats didn't move in the same way so I had to redo it a few times till finally the rats moved just like on the example. It is too restricted, it should be a little more liberal... Does it really matter how to do the bridge as long as the rats can get their cheese?			"

Full Disclosure: Copy supplied by the developer for review.What happens when you take World of Goo and combine it with Bridge Builder?! Well, you get Tiny Bridge Ratventure. The basic premise of the game is to traverse 2 rats through a hostile terrain by building structures to collect cheese. The main principal of this physics basic bridge builder is nothing new as there are a lot of these type of games on the market but Ratventure does offer a few different mechanics that set it asside from the rest. Regardless of Ratventures small amount originalities, they still do not justify a $10.99 price point. My recommendation is only to buy it on sale (like $.21).Lets look at the good (pro's), the bad (con's), and the ugly (straight-up ""no no's""). The Good (Pro's) is that I am partial to these physics based bridge builder type games. The developer Estelion added player semi-controlled mechanics (opposed to automated as most bridge builder games are but movement is limited to points on the structure) making traversing the structure a little more difficult with hazards on the map. To add to the difficulty, they've added bonus cheese for extra points in addition to the level ending big cheese. The non-player controlled mechanics (I want to call these sprites ""enemies"" but they both help and hinder progress, so we will label them as ""NPC's"") have both positive and negative affects on your structure, sometimes making it bounce and sway, or adding stability to a structure. Building on to your structure while while its swaying all over the screen adds a challenge as well as a lot more teadium to the time it takes to build. Though you are limited to only building strut parts to your structure, in addition to the NPC's there are added variables for your bridge in the maps. These include ancor points and rope suspenders, both of which you have little to no placement control over.  The Bad (Con's) is that there are a lot of these games to choose from. Most of which at the same price point (not on sale) offer better graphics, better sound, more gameplay options or are just cheaper. Next, the only instruction for the game is pictures... Yes, there is not one word written for this game. Though it easy is to pick up, you still have to figure out how to play this game through the cryptic picture instructions given to you at the begining; and even then, there is no explanation of what everything does. Regardless, there is always trial and error or the community hub... Good luck there! I have not confirmed this but it is apparent with the game play that Ratventure is likely ported from either Andriod or iOS formats (couldn't find this one on the Google market) the bad part about it is that the games porting was never updated for the PC. This becomes more apparent with the instructions telling you to use your finger with the game mechanics. The Ugly (straight-up ""no no's"") part of the bad is that while the graphics are only okay, there are 6 worlds, each are just reskinned repeats of the last, and they never offer additional mechanics to differenciate it from it from the others. The first bit of ugliness most will notice is the lack of menu options. The only options that are available are play, a link to the dev's website, instructions (or lack there-of), and mute - which is not a bad thing as both the sound and music are absolutely horendous. Make sure you have a decent playlist ready before you start playing. Lastly with the options (again... or lack there-of), there is no full screen (...or any other graphic options for that matter), no control options, not even an exit... wow. Estelion developers please note this article on The Ten Commandments of Video Game Menu's.OverviewGameplay: Physics based Logic Builder  
Graphics: Lacking but otherwise okay.
Sound: OMG! MAKE IT STOP!
Controls: Better on a touch screen. Mouse controls for everyone else. 
Replayability: Though I have yet to figure out how to get anything more than one star on a level, the challenge for more stars is offered. I'd think most people will never play a level again once it has been passed.
Overall: Good for a couple hours and is a fun game if you are into the gameplay, otherwise it may not be worth your time and money.
The verdict for gamers is to avoid it if your not into the gameplay and buy it on sale!			"

												NOTE:  I was provided a free copy of this game by the developers for review and video gameplay revealed on my Youtube channel.  Please search my username ZAXTOR99 on Youtube to find my video review as the Steam Youtube links are not currently working.Even though I was provided with a free evaluation copy of this new strategy puzzle game by the developers, my goal of providing honest feedback to my viewers doesn't change at all...With that, this game offers a decent amount of fun and strategy challenge in the few levels that I played, and that challenge is obviously growing with every successful level conquered.  The goal is to stretch triangular extensions of woodwork out in under the maximum number of moves allowed on each level to form a ""web"" or bridge for the rats to cross and get the cheese pieces on each level.  You must be careful in how you extend this framework as it is weight and physics based, and as the levels increase, hurdles such as spinning saw blades present added danger and challenge to your efforts.The problems I find in this game is that it just doesn't add anything to the game that it will likely remind every one, World of Goo.  World of Goo, even though it is many years older, still is much better in every aspect.  Add in the fact that there are no resolution or sound slider options in this game, and the fact this game tries to sell micro-transactions, and this game just falls face first into the 'average..nothing special"" void of games easily forgotten and never missed.My Scoring:VALUE: 15 out of 40FUN: 15 out of 30CONTROLS/BUGS: 17 out of 20GRAPHICS & SOUND: 5 out of 10-----------------------------------------MY TOTAL SCORE = 52%  Average, nothing special and nothing memorable, A better value at a lower price, perhaps a 50% or 80% off sale makes this game a better value for your money, but still nothing special.If this game looks up your alley, and you have missed World of Goo... then do yourself a favor and buy World of Goo FIRST.

												The physics of this game make no sense and the characters can't even walk on land; they have to walk on your structure.I couldn't even get past the 2nd level and it took me a long time to figure out what to do in the 1st level. You can only turn the music on or off; you can't adjust the volume of it. Also, clicking on the hint button removes your structure.This game's mechanics are terrible. I managed to pick it up on sale for less than a dollar, but it was still a waste of my money. Conclusion: Maybe I just don't know how to play, but I think that anyone that likes games like this should just go play World of Goo instead.			"

												WARNING to achievement hunters, Stay Away from this game. It involves waiting 15 minutes for hint availability and copying EXACTLY what the hint shows to get 3 stars, which involves building the bridges with leaning tilting swaying easily breakable beams that ends up being a guess and check system EVEN WITH the hints being used because theyre not universal lengths, the beams are measured how long you drag them out with your mouse, so even trying to copy the hint is nearly impossible. OH and sometimes the rats thatre supposed to cross dont even jump onto the bridge! wow!			"

												A tower/bridge building game where you need to get two rats across dangerous cliffs and saw blades to the precious cheese for consumption.This game is based on bridge builders and other apps of that similar nature and does it relatively well, the physics are sorta wierd and don't always make sense but it is a game about rats with clothing and briefcases looking for cheese in dangerous worlds. The art and music are decent, nothing overly special but suit the game just well.3 different chapters are available and have about 10-15 levels each, taking you about 1 hour per chapter (more so if you find 1 particular episode hard) Its relaxing and easy gameplay and user friendly, with hints and contruction help along the way. The one thing I have to say that makes me not recommend this game is the insane price for such a small, short and simple game. 12$ is incrediby overprice for a game worst maybe 5$. Complete review killer right there. Personal Rating: 2/5			"

I have recieved this game for free as part of a promotion for the game. Regardless of whether I paid for it or not, I remain unbiased in all of my reviews. My reviews reflect my opinion, and my opinion only.Is it bad I actually enjoy this one? Okay, so, I loved World of Goo. It was cute, it was fun, it was perfect. This one works off of a similar mechanic, the only difference being now you have two rats you have to get across that put weight on your structures. Makes for some interesting gameplay, I look forward to playing more. The style, the premise and the music are all simple and fun.  Would I spend $20 on it? Not necessarily, but I would pay $10... That's saying a lot coming from me since I rarely buy a game over $5 these days.			"

												I only purchased this as it was for the low cost of 21 cents, and on my mobile device I like puzzles of this variety (think ""World of Goo"". As an IOS or Google store game for android devices I could see this working well, but on PC it is a little more tedious. It really didn't hold my attention for long even as a ""taking a break from X"" game to kill 20 minutes. I felt like its a bit tedious as a bridge builder because your last section has to line up with the last brick of cheese rather than the objective being simply crossing the obstacle itself. I wouldn't pay full price for this at all, but at 21 cents I figured ""why not?""			"

Tiny Bridge: AchievementureNote: I've idled for cards for 4,8 hours. My actual playtime is high for reasons. Find out below. I also got the game for 20-ish cents, if I remember correctly.Benefits :◆Plenty of levels.◆Undo 1 move button.◆Zoom-in and zoom-out options.◆Trading cards.◆Achievements.Drawbacks :◆No fullscreen option. Alt + enter won't work either.◆There are some bugs. When you undo a move sometimes the construction you've build would move (literally), resulting in planks getting cut or in a death. Either way you have to restart the level.◆Another well-know bug is when you build a diagonal bridge and when it's close to falling but not that close planks go bananas, the construction is rotating and you have to retry the level.◆The price seems a bit high, in my opinion as the game is not perfect and for 10 euros one would probably expect more.◆The game crashed at least once.◆Frogs dying when they see a construction moving close to them. Wtf?◆Some of the levels require you to place planks exactly as shown in the hint video making the game extremely difficult. I knew what I needed to do and I still spent at least 4 hours trying to complete a single level. That's anything but normal given the fact that it could be finished in 3-4 mins... Also I haven't completed that level yet and I am not sure if I will be able to do so at all, sadly.Conclusion :I had some fun playing the game, but I raged and was frustrated too. Mostly the latter. Avoid at all costs. Worse than Bad Rats even. Why? Because someone had spent a week trying to complete a single level to no avail. Other - 12 hours on a level that they did finish at least. And I have been stuck on one for 4+ hours. It's funny because these levels can be completed in a couple minutes or so. This game is simply not worth your time.Try Harder Simulator "

Nevertheless, an entertaining little game (which is a little overpriced). Nothing negative about it. I couldn't recommend this, however, because it doesn't have any specific feature that would appeal to me, and most likely others.			"

												Another typical build a bridge game. This time with a twist where you need to use some mice as counterweight to use as few bridge parts as you can.To be honest i don't recommend this game. You can play this type of game on most flashgame homepages, and its not even that well made. No story, and not really any new features.The only reason to buy this game is because of the added hardness from needing to use the counterweight, and only if you really love this type of game.			"

Game: Ratventure ChallengeGenre: Dynamic Bridge BuilderDeveloper: EstelionPublisher: EstelionCopy supplied by developerRatventure Challenge is the port of an iOS puzzle game (or ""dynamic bridge builder"" as the creators like to call it) developed and published by Estelion. It's about a couple of rats who want an unlimited amount of cheese, and that's what they do for the entire game.GRAPHICSThe characters and background don't look bad or anything, but the repetitive levels and poor animations show the game's nature as mobile game port.GAMEPLAYYour goal is to reach the big piece of cheese at the other end of the level, while trying to use less pieces of wood for your bridge as possible, as well as collecting as many pieces of cheese as possible to get an higher score at the end of level. Either I am really bad at this game, or there is something wrong with the physics. Most of the time, you will feel really frustrated by the unintuitive gameplay. There is a hint system which tells you exactly what to do to beat a level, but having to alternate between constructing and moving the rats doesn't make things easier and show that not much love was put into the port.CHALLENGEThe game doesn't feel challenging, but frustrating. The physics are illogical, the level design is not all that great and there is no learning curve: you'll find yourself going from an easy level to an hard one to an easy one again in a matter of seconds.SOUNDRepetitive music? Check. Poor amount of sound effects? Double check. Music not playing randomly? TRIPLE CHECK.REPLAYABILITYOther than trying to get an high-score in each of the 72 levels, there aren't secrets or unlockables that will make you come back to this game.This game is not for me, mostly because of its obvious nature as an iOS port and the terrible physics. The game is relatively cheap, and if you like this genre then you will love this and have a good time. Otherwise, you would be wasting money.Story: n/a

Ratventure Challenge – A Steam Review[Disclamer - I was provided a copy by the publisher for review purposes]12.05.2015 UPDATE - Today's update removed microtransactions and added a restart button, so two of my earlier negative points raised are now futile.In-game microtransactions. That's a big no-no for a PC game. Convoluted menu that makes restarting the level a chore. Multiple times I've pressed undo while trying to reset the levelIt's a very good thing when the developer listens to the community and acts accordingly. Thumbs upThe goodEasy to learn, hard to master gameplayClean graphics and enjoyable soundThe not so good:  Sometimes the tall skinny rat didn't want to move, thus having to restart the level.The conclusion: Bridge builder with nice clean graphics. It's a good puzzler and will keep you entertained for a while.You can see me playing it here -

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												When I originally bought this, I was looking forward to playing this. It was alright for the first 5 - 10 levels, but then it became dull and boring for me. However, this is just my personal preference. Pros: - Game is rather simple.  - The physics are okay.Cons:  - Redundant gameplay. Feels like you are playing the same levels over and over. - ""Building"" the bridge is VERY limited to what you can do.  - Game play overall feels a lot like Angry Birds; try and get 3 stars on every level to unlock more levels. - The background music doesn't really help the ""fun"" factor. It's cute, but hearing the same thing loop over and over gets old fast.Again, everyone has their own opinion. This is just mine.			"

												If world of goo is using dynamic stuctures to find static solutions, TBR is using static structures to find dynamic solutions. All but the earliest levels will rely on your bridge bending, breaking, or falling off a cliff to solve the puzzle. It's a neat idea, but between the interface, the sound design and the infuriating piece placement I can't bring myself to reccomend it. It all becomes a chore far too quickly.Steam really needs a ""meh"" review option, but in lieu of than it's getting a thumbs down.			"

												I like puzzle games, but they have to be consistent. Tiny Bridge isn't.It's not a bad game. It won't break your computer or grope your sister. It's just not very good.A mildly interesting concept moderately well realized leads to a generally okay puzzler. It's alright, I guess. It's resolutely meh.If you want something to kill a little time with, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.			"

												Would be much more fun if you wouln't be forced to move only on the bridge girders in order to reach the cheese, so the game could gain at least some replayability.But it has a low price especially during Steam-Sale, so you'll maybe already satisfied with the trading cards & achievements. ^^			"

												I love a good puzzle game and this game does an 'ok' job to satisfy my puzzle-game cravings, It is so, because you are building bridges to help the two mice reach the cheese, but the component of reaching 3-stars is more puzzling than building the bridges to reach the cheese. I've played a few levels now where I have no clue how 3-stars can be reach, but I can definitely solve how to reach all the cheese successfully. The physics behind this game can be frustrating, but easily adaptable as you play. Once you've played a few rounds, you'll understand that if the mice are walking on it, you'd expect how much the bridge may or may not dip and hit a saw. Similarly, understanding how to swing the bridge unintentially to obtain the cheese. Overall, I'd give this a 5.8/10. If you are aiming for 3-star completion every round, this game might cause more frustration than satistfaction. I recommend it as a game to pass time and pick up again when you want to play a puzzle game.			"
