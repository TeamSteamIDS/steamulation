												This is a fun game to play localy. The keys are simple yet it is quite hard to combine a few normal steps together :). I myself bought the game because I have seen it in this video ->

												Dude...this game is amazing. So challenging yet so rewarding. I said it in my review below along with other points, but if you screw up your race 9/10 times, the 1 time you get it right...it just feels so great.

The only con I have is the tutorial should instead give you feedback per your step. If I press the button too early by a millisecond it ruins the continuity of learning by making me fix the mistake.The daily challenge is sweet, the levels are perfect, I would just want more events eventually!Great job!

												OMG! This game is fantastic. It's fun as hell and it has a quite nice learning curve.I do admit that this game has already made me frustrated couple of times, but in a good way... unlike QWOP.Alright; lets get to the actual game:As the title of the game says, this is most of all a running game where you have to press and release buttons with right  timing to make your athlete move properly. The game itself has various running distances for you to compete on and it also has jumping sports in it as well. Unlike in QWOP; in Ragdoll Runners you can actually move FORWARD...without FLIPS.The game has online best times list and you can compare your times with your friends on steam as well... AND...the best part: LOCAL SPLITSCREEN MULTIPLAYER (up to 4 playes I think)!!!!!! PS. no online MP [atleast atm]If you have the gamepads and you know that you have friends coming over, then on less than 5e price...THIS IS THE MUST BUY GAME !Pros:- Splitscreen multiplayer- Good learning curve- Cheap- Fun as hellCons:- Skipping work to play- Playing at work- Beating your boss on the game on worktime making him mad10/10 - Would get boss mad again			"

												I really just got this, so I can't say much about the replayability of this game yet... But learning this game is actually a lot more fun than I expected it to be. I'm not quite there yet but there is definitely a nice feel to the physics and controls. Although it can be fun watching you crawl over the track like a baby seal the game invites you to master the skills and improve your records. Having the masterboards adds a bit to the challenge. 5 euro's is not cheap, but I think a fair price. I think this game has potential for something a bit bigger and more polished, but for now I'm enjoying it quite a bit, as I said it is more fun than I expected.			"

												This game is hilarious. It also frustrates me in a way that few other games have ever done before.If you've ever played QWOP and thought ""you know what this game needs? Multiple athletic events"", then this is the game for you, you sick, twisted, so and so.In all seriousness, I highly rate this game, it's a lot of fun, makes you constantly keep saying ""one more try"" and lets you backflip and wiggle like a fish out of water. 10/10.

												JM viking is a tryhard (negative review, which was meant to be a joke)EDIT:Since I got a response from the actual developer (which has never happened for me)I decided to edit my review into NOT a joke and into an ACTUAL reviewThe game is a lot of fun and the controls are simple unlike another similar game QWOP, and trust me good controls make the game good. The game has very nice graphics and also amazing background noises which change depending on how you play.I never disliked the game and sometimes I come and play when there is nothing else to play.I have made games myself and published them on some sites and I know what it's like to get negative feedback from some asshat saying that ''jm viking is a tryhard hurr durr'' so thats why i decided to make an actual honest review			"

												Apparently Lucifer is actively developing video games again.

2d physics running game with multiple events and online leaderboards. All revolve around running and jumping using your arrow keys to move your legs.It's a simple mechanic but does lead to some funny results if not a broken keyboardI have never used my arrow keys so much.Highly recommend convicts are forced to play at least 8 hours a day.
