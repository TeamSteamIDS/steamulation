												8/10While Blood bowl is a great game to play (Seriously, I've logged over 300 hours on this one!) You want the Chaos edition.  On the other hand, sometimes it can be cheaper to buy this one AND the Chaos edition  than to buy this one alone...			"

												You will lose. repeatedly. the other team will slip past your perfectly organized defenseyour defenders will get knocked out somehowyou'll fumble the ball when it's right in front of your player you will miss a throw, fail a block, lose players and watch everything you've so carefully organized be pummeled to gibs.But you'll get better.the more you play it, the more you'll understand the rules and how the nature of the game works.you'll have that moment where a perfect play comes together, or you see an opening in the enemy team's defense and just go for it. And when you do score that touchdown? It feels great. It's a difficult system to master and I'm sure as hell not there yet either. But from what I played on the 360 version and this, it can definately feel really rewarding when you nail it. And even if you don't? You can at least make your opponent have to work for it. "

												Recommended for anyone looking to get a start with playing Blood Bowl. Blood Bowl 2 has come out however the editions of BB1 are great value since they have more teams available and BB1 still follows the same rule set.As for the gameplay, its essentially a combination of football, chess, and dice rolls. Many things do come down to random chance, but the goal is to ensure that you take chances in your favour to give yourself the best possible chance of success. Eventually all your players will die, you will lose the ball in the most random/unpredictable way and you with hang your head. No the dice are not stacked against you, and your not going to win every game. If you cant handle that than this isnt the game for you.			"

												""WELCOME, SPORTS FANS! ARE YOU READY FOR ANOTHER SKULL-SPLITTING, BONE-CRUSHING GOOD TIME?""Ah, what fun it is to play the good ol' Blood Bowl! I used to play the tabletop version and fell in love. This version has all the charm (and frustration) of American football gone medieval, the best strategies lain waste to bad dice rolls, and multiple races with all the expected strengths and weakness common with Warhammer fantasy. The upgraded commentary from our two favorite Blood Bowl aficionados, Jim (Vampire) and Bob (Ogre), keep a smile on your face with every result... even the ones that go against you. The rulebook is also included from the tabletop version to define everything you need to know about the game.I prefer playing the turn-based ""Blitz"" mode, which allows for some customization of your teams, players, and adds additional flavor of spells, crowds and riot-causing fans, as well as player equipment (upgraded helmets, pads, etc which add to your abilities), bribing the ref, and many more. I love to win and hate to lose because this game make you sweat for every inch of the Pitch (playing field)!For the first time player, tutorials are included. The game is easy to learn but does have some complexion in the variety of rules to be tracked. I recommend to put it on easy mode and play a couple games to get the hang of it after you do the tutorials.Multiplayer mode is also available and I use it! My friends who play with me love to rant and rave about the worst roll or that last second catch at the end of the match that scored the game-winning touchdown! WARNING! This game will test your frustration limits! I mean, COME ON!, how does a strength 2 halfling charge a strength 6 minotaur and KO him!?? WTH, man!? LOL!Again, I loved it back in the 80's when I originally played it tabletop, and this brings back all the fun! It did so well that it received a go at ""Blood Bowl 2""!			"

												American Football meets Warhammer is probably the best way to describe Cyanide Studio's sporting epic called Blood Bowl which throws gamers into this deadly universe. Apart from sporting and a healthy dose of violence, there is even some RPG and management aspects added to the game to keep things quite original and fresh. Throwing together a variety of characters from the world of Warhammer, gamers can now experience a sporting game with a difference as Orcs, Humans, Goblins and the like all fight for victory on the field and although these games were quite popular in the yesteryear of gaming, it's great to see a developer run with the idea again.In terms of gameplay, Blood Bowl Legendary Edition is not your traditional sports game but you’ve probably guessed that already. As opposed to the console sport games, this title is a turn based strategy. The biggest change to this edition as opposed to previous games is that the developers have included a variety of new races into the mix such as High Elves and the Undead. Elves can also ""glamour"" their foes which does allow you to control them. The secret is 11 new playable races! Then you have the streamlined online play that actually makes it more fun to play it online as opposed to single-player. The only issues with online is trying to find another player and with offline, the AI is a little less than challenging.If you haven’t played the board game or the previous  PC game, I thoroughly recommend that you follow every step of the tutorial because as opposed to American Football, there are quite a few tweaks and changes to be found. From kicks to tackles and dodging, the learning curve of this title, especially if you are unfamiliar with American Football or rugby to an extent is quite high. Things become even more challenging with the inclusion of Blood Bowl rules.Once you have completed the tutorial, the story mode is probably the best place to start which allows you to put your skills into action…slowly. In this mode, you play a mercenary trainer or ""coach"" for your selected race,as you play a variety of games. Another fun mode is the campaign mode which offers you a plethora of levels or games to play but offers some unlockable content as you gain new powers and players.However the star of the title is playing the game online as you engage in a variety of matches and leagues. There is a new commissioner tool that has been added into the game. This gives the owner of a particular league, some power in terms of resetting matches or replays. This is how Blood Bowl should be played. Just be warned that dying sucks...  especially when one of your stars decided to take a dirt nap from getting killed by an opponent or opponent. Or those pesky vampires that get blood lust and wish to feed on not only their opponents but also the fans!Despite some flaky matchmaking and an apparent ability for less scrupulous players to 'predict' incoming dice rolls, online play in Blood Bowl is still a whole lot of fun. Custom leagues exist for those of you that want to dodge the minefield of random play, with a thriving community dedicated to providing decent opposition and eradicating the sort of rage-quitting and general idiocy that unfortunately rears its head during regular play with strangers. Also it's worth noting that due to the hugely expanded roster the Legendary Edition remains very much open to questions of imbalance, but in part that's simply a design choice. Choosing a smaller team such as the Halflings will never give you a fair crack at winning, but including the weaker races will placate a large section of the audience that wants an authentic experience and a distinct challenge for veterans. Yes it's disappointing to see a bewildering lack of instruction to new players on how to avoid the more obvious mismatches, but you get the feeling that developer Cyanide rarely took their eyes off developing a title that served the old guard first and foremost - the type of people that will be only too happy to have a large range of playable races and head into every game fully prepared for the likely challenge of encountering each. The graphics mirror the board game perfectly and all the characters look like their real-world miniature painted figures. The animation is good as are the stadium backgrounds and special effects. It’s funny seeing these mythical creatures compete in a sport game similar to American Football with its all regalia. The stadiums look pretty cool as well and there around 10 new areas for you to compete in. The soundtrack with its rock inspired mythic focus suits the game well as do the sound effects. Overall, it’s a good looking game, especially on high detail.So do I recommend this game? If you’re a fan of Blood Bowl, than you’ve come to the right place but just be warned that online play is a must. Sports fans would probably be annoyed due to the limited control of the players but once again this game is a strategy not an arcade sports title.			"

												(tl;dr below)After reading reviews and watching some videos, I discovered that this might be a tough game to learn. With that in mind, I bought the legendary edition for full price, thinking I could upgrade to the chaos edition after I learned how to play. That was yesterday. Well, today, the Chaos edition went on sale for $12 for the next 4 months. How positively unfortunate. Well, for those of you looking for more info and less facepalm, the game is a blast...so far. I jumped straight into an offline campaign (classic mode, hard difficulty). I've only played the first 2 games, but they were both nail-biting, edge-of-my-seat fun. I won both games (first one came down to the last 2 turns, second one was much easier). I'm sure the competition will get harder as all our teams level up.I noticed in the reviews people complaining about the RNG, claiming it's all dumb luck; after watching several games and playing 2 myself, this really isn't as bad as they make it out to be in my opinion. Look at all your options each turn, take the low-risk actions first, then go for the high risk actions at the end of your turn (or don't even take the high-risk actions if you don't need to). It's a strategy game about risk management, not a blind RNG hack and slash. You really need to think things through, or you are really going to hate the game. Yes, there's dice, and yes, sometimes those dice will want to violate you. Painfully. But it IS within your power to severely effect the LIKELIHOOD of such events. I was able to end the bulk of my turns by clicking the ""End of Turn"" button rather than bad rolls. The few that were ended from bad rolls were mostly high risk actions that I knew full well ahead of time might end badly, and I was sure to take those actions last for that very reason.During the first game, I used up the full 4-minute time bank almost every turn to really look over my options. 4 minutes might seem like a lot, but when you are new to the game it goes by fast. At first I had trouble frantically trying to get through everything I wanted to before the time ran out. Fortunately, somewhere between the first and second game I started being able to regularly figure out my plans and execute them with a cool head and time to spare. It helped that I watched several pvp matches before I bought the game.I can't say much about the rest of the game (all the different team strategies, game modes, skills etc), as I haven't explored it all yet, but I can say with confidence, I most certainly will. I do know that every team plays different, and that the way you set up each team (funds, skills, roster, formations etc) makes them play vastly different as well. Those different possibilities coupled with the fact that there is RNG involved really means there are many different game experiences to be had, and I look forward to trying them out. I am very excited to add this game to my library and wear it out, even if I DID buy it for full price the DAY BEFORE IT WENT ON SALE FOR 60% OFF FOR THE NEXT 4 MONTHS!Sheesh...Just gonna forget that happened. Eventually.tl;drGame -> GoodBuy.Play.Be happy. Or infuriated due to dice rolls. But still somewhat kinda happy somewhere deep down.			"

												For sale on steam: Membership to a cult.Specifically, the cult of Nuffle - Chaos god of random ♥♥♥♥ happening in an amusing way.Welcome to Bloodbowl, a turn based tabletop sports game/religious ceremony of Nuffle based off the Warhammer fantasy boardgame of the same name.For those unaware of Bloodbowl and what it is. It is essentially what happens when you take (American) football and set it in the Warhammer universe. For those who don't know American football, players take a ball and try to run it into the opponent's endzone, at the other side of the field.This scores them a point, and whoever has the most points at the end of the match wins.Unique to Bloodbowl, however, is that it's heavier on the action. Orks don't particularly enjoy making a run with the ball to see if they can score that way. They'll just get together and try to punch their way through the opponent's lines. And this can lead to injuries or even deaths on both sides.Also different from the physical sport is that this is mainly turn based(A real-time mode exists too, if you prefer that). Players take turns moving their players and performing actions. It is surprisingly strategic and you need to think about your moves. You can do a lot of risky things, but your turn ends immediately if things go too wrong. If your players go down, if you fail to pick up the (Often slippery) ball, you score a point or you run out of time to make your moves - That's the end of your turn. This, combined with the chance based mechanics (It is based off a boardgame, dice are involved in pretty much all actions) and a critical success and failure system means that anything is possible. You can come back from the worst of positions, and you can always end up losing from the best of positions, but there is skill to be found here other than just random luck. Skill, and strategy in Bloodbowl is not twitch based, build orders, or micromanagement. Instead of that, It's your risk management. If you can position your players so that they force your opponent to take risks, then it is likely that he will at some point fail at it. And then you can come in, get the ball loose, and try to score. If you do not know how to attack the opponent's defensive formation without taking unnecessary risks, you'll end up with players laying down and the opponent stealing the ball away from you. The lack of 100% winning strategies, and chance based things mean that every match is different, and as such it has great replayability, variety, and new situations almost every time you play, while the online play, private leagues, and team progression means you will be able to play a long time without getting bored.When things go well, and your worst player slaps down an ogre? Praise Nuffle! When your elf catcher trips on his own shoelaces and breaks his neck? Praise Nuffle!The end result of a match isn't the goal you're playing for. It's the journey there - If you don't take it too seriously you'll be able to enjoy this game, but if you can't stand bad luck where you can just roll critical failures every turn? It might just be frustrating then.For fans of games that do things differently, or just fans of boardgames, I can recommend this. And if you're wondering about Legendary and Chaos edition then don't worry. They're compatible with eachother. You'll be able to play with people who own the other version too			"

												Its a faithful board game conversion that I am certain (despite rampant criticism) does not cheat.  Unfortunately, the AI is so bad I sometimes wish it did.  Even so, the game is fun in single player and more fun in multiplayer.  As for the board game itself, it is strategic and occaisionally random enough to make it interesting.  Game balance is kind of wacky (in the board game as well, some teams are difficult to play on purpose) but this only adds to the charm in my opinion.  The bragging rights one wins when scoring a touchdown as the Halflings counts as a buff in my book.			"

												My old review for this was positive. And it technically still is. Blood Bowl is a great game. The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.Keyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.Ordinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.

												I loved this game, Khemris are so fun to play, crushing other players is SO fun!If you liked the boardgame then you must want to get it already, but for the newbies i'll try to describe why this game is so good. The number of teams is really nice because each team represents different playstyle : the humans are pretty much balanced and you'll be able to throw passes or run through the opponent's line whereas elves' playstyle is based mainly on passes and dodging tackles due to their agility, Khemris will try to litteraly crush the opponent's line to get their holder of the ball to the touchdown because they can't do a single pass while gobelins will play dirty by using unconventionnal weapons during the match such as chainsaws, pogo sticks etc...At the beginning you'll be a little lost if you didn't play the board game because nearly nothing is explained, you'll have to read the rules book and that will take you about 1h to get through this but when you master the rules it gets really fun. You should start by playing the campaign mode because that's how you'll learn most easily.			"

												Board game to video game translations are rarely any fun to anyone except players of the original board game.  Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition continues this grand tradition by being completely impenetrable to anyone that's not completely familiar with the board game.  To be clear, I've spent two hours trying to figure out the rules, I've played through the tutorial several times, and I've even browsed the official rulebook.  I still don't have the faintest clue what's going on.  Just for the hell of it, I played a match using the biggest handicap I could muster.  I was completely murdered.If I had to guess, and at this point that's all I have, the problem is with the source material, not with the translation to a video game.  There's apparently a die role for EVERYTHING.  Want to walk forward three feet?  Roll a die.  Want to kick the ball?  Roll a die.  I can't see how anyone could actually play this on cardboard.  Strangely enough, all these rules become a bigger problem in the computer version.  The elves just scored a touchdown and I can't figure out how...they passed at least a dozen skill checks, and they went by too fast for me to understand what happened.So, for a final word, if you like the board game, you'll probably like the adaptation.  There are a ton of teams in this version and it looks like a ton of rules have been implemented.  As a newcomer to Blood Bowl, however, I was completely lost and the game did nothing to help me.

												Blood Bowl is an awesome game, full of trolls and orks and violence and football. Or rugby. Kind of a rugbyfootball. I had never played the miniature game, but having grown up in comic and game shops, was exposed to it and always loved the concept. As far as I can tell and from what my buddies tell me, this is very faithful to the core mechanics of the miniature game, as well as the teams available and rules for how to make up your teams.Don't be fooled by the single player feature, this is a multiplayer game. Unlike most games however, this isn't not a pick up and play game. Don't get me wrong, you can, but this is a game designed around leagues and competition.There are thousands of laughs to be had and I reccomend this game to anyone who loves tactical strategy titles. When your star player reaches level 5 when most other players in the league are 2 at most, you'll really learn what Blood Bowl is when you watch him die as the medics fail to revive him because an angry fan threw a rock at him.

												Jolly good! A marvelous and sophisticated, sportsmanlike activity, which compels rugged, dashing and well mannered players to gently push each other out of their paths, as they valiantly attempt to transport the ball into their opponent's goal line. Whereupon each side humbly congratulates the goal scorer and bears no grudges upon the next kick off. Friendly medical staff stand by to treat the occasional scratch or bump that the players might suffer now and again. All-in-all, this is a very gentlemanly sport, which promotes goodwill and .... AAAAAH! Who am I kidding? If you believed that crock, then you should not buy this game!!! Because you'll only find violence aplenty, grudges, spikes, bad tempers, kick-em-when-they're-down tactics, haymakers, broken backs, ugly ruffians, even uglier players, blood red grass, bribery and all those other things that fans enjoy in a ball game.

												I know there are a ton of fans of this game and it's later releases, but one thing I need to let people now, this game has a ton of rulesand a very steep learning curve.From the way the store page is set-up I got this game thinkingit was a turn-based version of American Football with a fantasy theme.I couldn't have been more wrong.The game requires a LOT of reading, practice, more reading through Wikis,rulebooks and online videos.*** This is NOT American Football simulator ***.This is a statisical sports game that uses dice rolls, a ton of rules andeach player has different abilities that you have to know what each one if for,you have to know how the odds and dice rolls affect every action in the gameand it even uses Crowd/Fan reactions to determine how a play is carried out.A very confusing mix and sports, dice, and magic abilities.I know American Football rules very well and they did not help me at all!The tutorial is not straight forward at all and seems to come at you asif you understand a lot more about the game than you would.When something isn't explained the tutorial just tells you to read the rulebook.Sorry guys, but unless you already have played the board game and understand it,OR you have days and weeks to dedicate to learning an entirely new type of sports game,that has as many rules as a D&D gamebook, then you are going to be as confused as I was.I honestly thought this was ""Madden with Orcs"". It is nowhere near that.I am not downvoting this because it's a bad game.It looks like if you had the time to learn everything yourself,(The tutorial does NOT do it's job) then, this game might be something worth playing.But if you come into this with the same expectations I did, you will be upset and feel lost.I am downvoting this because the store page for this game did sell it as a ""Madden with Orcs""type of game, nowhere in the videos or descriptions did it make it clear justhow deep of a learning curve this game requires.

												I bought this game several years ago. I'm not quite sure why I did but it was on sale and I thought 'why not?'. I got a good 20 or so hours in but the whole time I didn't really know what I was doing. I didn't bother read the rulebook and I was going about the game by feel. Yet somehow... I was having fun. I didn't even bother with the story mode or anything. I just kept setting up games with teams I thought looked cool and had at it! Fast forwarding to now, I had a strange urge to play Blood Bowl again but this time actually learn how to play. I did the tutorial, read through the rulebook, watched some YouTube videos of people playing the actual board game itself, and played some of the campaign with a nice dwarven team I called ""The LIttle D's"" with the motto ""Our ♥♥♥♥♥ are small but so are you!"". From what I've seen on the discussions, you will NEED to read the rulebook or else you won't be having much fun here. The game really isn't that hard but there's a slight learning curve that I really think isn't so bad. Now onto the game...When it comes to core gameplay, it's quite fun! It's essentially just the board game so in the chance you've played and liked Blood Bowl in real life, you'll enjoy this too. After you create a team and really make it your own, you can then play through the campaign or make special matches or whatever. During each individual match, you set up 11 of your guys however you wish. The ball gets kicked and then you and your opponent take turns trying to grab the ball and take it to the end zone to score a point. It's really not that easy though! You'll be constantly moving players around trying find the best position, knocking guys over, pushing through walls of enemies, tossing the ball, and so on. There is an element of chance in there though that forces you to be careful. Each one of your guys may only move once BUT if a 'turnover' occurs then you must immediately end your turn and you'll only get 16 turns total in a game! At eight turns the game resets for it's halftime. For a turnover to occur, you might drop the ball, fail to pick it up, one of your guys gets turned flat on their face, and more. Imagine only moving one guy out of eleven and then your opponment moves all their fellas! That's a massive setback. The risk-management of this game keeps you on your toes. Not only that, who knows what could happen! Maybe one of your guys screws up what should have been an easy task or someone just flat out dies! If you want a game that relies 100% on skill then this isn't for you. To me, I prefer 100% skill but it's still quite fun nonetheless! I will admit, I've enjoyed this game so much that I'm considering buying a physical copy of Blood Bowl and buying the sequel Blood Bowl 2. If you got the cash, it might be better to just purchase the second game over this version but I haven't tried it so I can't say. Also, apparently the board game version released a 5th edition just last year on the gamesworkshop website. It's 99 bucks. If you've never done miniature wargaming or the like before, people often times paint their miniatures. Gamesworkshop sells special paints you can use to paint the models it comes with. I look forward to doing that myself. In regards to multiplayer, I have yet to try it. Personally, this feels like the type of game I'd rather play with friends, family, and maybe folks at a games shop. Even still, I don't have an opinion outside of that. I'd assume most folks have moved on to the second version of the game but I can't say. Singleplayer has been very fun and rewarding for it feels somewhat like a sandbox game to me. I can come up with all sorts of scenarios to play through and mix the rules up a bit or whatever I want. After all that windin up, I just let it go and see what happens! The game is really best played from that perspective over just purely winning in my opinion. RNG will do nothing but ♥♥♥♥ you off for this is a game with lots of risk involved. Every match is an adventure with a whole rollercoaster of ups and down and twists and turns. I've had games where I was just about to win and then something crazy happened like I tripped up or somehow the enemy managed to catch up with me. It's all these little things that keep the game exciting and fun. If that sounds good to you then I highly recommend giving Blood Bowl an honest try!			"

												9/10This game is perfect for anyone famliar with the bloodbowl game. Brutal at times if you're not caeful, always best to double check the route your taking and tackle zones when moving around as that auto route can be a little wonky sometimes, but other than that flawless representation of the board game.Note for newbies, this game is brutal and punishes mistakes harshly, make sure to put the time in the learn how the system works to avoid getting frustrated.

												I know that blood bowl II is available, and that it has a better graphic, but this game is still the way to go IMO.And now to the serious part!: let the review begin!He tackles, he runs, heeeee fumbles and fails miserably (not again)!- blood bowl is not a game for the faint of hearted or those for whome random misfortune always strikes (trust me it does, things that will only happen mathematically 0.014% has happened to me in a match xD).With this being said it is highly competitive, great to fight your friends in your own league and often times fine to fight the more experienced players who has leveled up a team or two.I can recommend reading the rulebook, as most aspects of the game will be explained here and it will give you a way better approach and understanding of the game.But if you like sports games, tactics and a bit of violence here or there I would definitely recommend picking up bloodbowl legendary or chaos edition (stick with this version as you have assess to so many more teams than in the 2. :) ).Best of luck to you and happy gaming dear reader!

												If recommend this game to anyone with the patience to take some RNG arrows to the knee. At times the random role can be infuriating but no more than any game involving a dice roll! It's clunky but a fairly faithful board game adaptation and the league play with friends is brilliant (once you've got it working).Once you accept some basic strategies (like taking active that don't involve a dice roll first), and that your team will suffer injuries, deaths, bad luck, and start off completely rubbish... the game opens up and is a huge amount of fun. Would recommend over the sequel at the moment as it appears single player is better and you get more teams for your money.			"

												Turnbased fantasy sports game, is pretty kickass. Kind of like merrican football (maybe? I dunno, merrican football is whacked as all hell) but heavily based on dice rolls whenever you pass, catch, tackle etc.It's all about positioning, weighing up risk/reward etc. pretty deep stuff. There's also a ton of races each with their own way of playing the game and specialties that fits rather well, and somehow ends up being fairly balanced (although dark elves kick ♥♥♥ deal w/ it)If you like the idea of orcs beating on elves and then screwing their cheerleaders, should check it out.

												I have been a fan of the game since its original version of the mid 80's (which was cardboard cut-outs) and every version since.  BB is one of the most well designed games ever produced by Games Workshop, and the classic timed *turn-based* computer version is a faithful emulation of the boardgame.  The game has three formats--the classic version of the game, the classic version with some additional rule variants and customization options (which can be fun), and the 'real-time' Blitz version.  Of the three versions, the most fun for me is the classic version with or without the variants.  I do not enjoy the Blitz version of the game at all.  Regardless, the title is worth owning.  For me, the replay value is very high and I especially enjoy playing against my son in multiplayer mode.			"

												At first I thought about buying it because it seemed like a football game. It is not. It is a board game.That being said, it is an amazing board game with tons of strategy to be used by each individual race. Yes, each race has positives and negatives, but if you play your cards (rolls) right, you can beat any team with any other team. If I were to compare its strategy to any sport I would say soccer with a small mix of football. Marking players and utilizing tackle zones is your best bet. All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy, violence, or Warhammer. All 3? Absolutely get this game.			"

												The game is a pretty good bit of fun, but a huge issue is that literally 90% of the game is dice rolling. And they don't pretend to hide it either. Basically the entire strategy of the portion is to limit the dice rolling to be in your favor as much as possible or to try and avoid it alltogether OR to stock up on rerolls. Now again, the game is pretty fun, when things work out in your favor. But it can be incredibly frustrating when playing a neck and neck match with someone and then losing your entire turn the first move because you failed a dice roll.There's also some serious balancing issues with several races being incredibly worthless and a few being super powerful and still easy to play. Regardless, the game is an interesting take on a 'fantasy football' (Yes, that's what I'm going to call this) type of game with some amusing commentary... for the first 3 matches. For a game that's been rereleased a dozen times I'd expect it to be more polished, but if you want about a few hours of enjoyment from a unique turn based strategy game then you can't really go wrong here.7.4/10.

												This is one of those games. I wish that had a neutral response for a recommendation. However, as a first  timer of this game. I must say it's really fun, and really challening.First off, this game is great for the fans who played the table-top version. If your a fan of the board game, then you'll be a fan of the games. Although not perfect, the game is at least enjoyable for the fan.However, for the casual gamer who didn't play the table top version and decide to get this game for whatever reason. The learning experirence might be ""straight-foward"" but in reality it requires trial by error. Meaning, in order to get better at the game you'll have to lose a bunch of times in order to get better. My advice? Play with a friend who owns the game. But don't go straight to the multiplayer, the tutorial is there, but it doesn't come across as ""helpful"" sure it might sound easy enough, but that is why there is the ""in-game manual"" in that manual it broaden's the game and really get's in-depth.The game overall has a bunch of stuff: teams with their unique players and stats. You can customize them, and fight in some very amazing locations. You have two modes a Blitz mode that can tailor your experience, and a classic mode that follows the rules of the table-top.Lastly the game has a ""luck"" system. Sure it might not be so direct, or it could not exist at all and is mainly player error. What I am trying to say is. If you ""rage quit"" it's not the games fault. The game has everything right then and there to help you. And if you have to lose in order to win. Go ahead and lose at least you get the experience to make yourself better. Don't hate the game because it's ""un-fair"" no it's because you need to fully grasp the game's concept and mechanics.Overall if you like this sort of game. I recommend it.			"

												Focus home interactive are complete morons unable to do a single thing right. However they still couldn't completely destroy the spirit of bloodbowl. This game isn't entirely as fun as it could've been with version 3 of the rules, but the version 4 version makes the game play faster ; ideal for the computer. Beats having to remember and calculate stuff when playing the board game version. Version 4 of the rules means strength has the advantage over agility though, making it not as well balanced as it could've been. Nevertheless. It's a good game. Just turn off the music and comentary once you've heard all stuff it has to say (in like 5 minutes).			"

												This game makes me sad because Blood Bowl is a wonderful thing and more people should get to experience it. But instead of getting some good gameplay and an idea of what Blood Bowl is all about it breeds frustration and leads to rage quits and players bursting out in rants on how the game is cheating. This could have been avoided with a more thorough tutorial, the option of a more forgiving gameplay and a less step learning curve. As it is now it just makes me sad.			"

												Oh boy, this f#cking game. I must be honest, all I knew about this game is that it was violent, and that I had played a demo around 8 or so years ago. And well, seeing it with a big sale like that, I couldn't really hold it and decided to buy it. Is it bad? Is it good? As usual I'm gonna start talking about what it does worse, then move up from there. First and foremost, the worst part of the game has to be it's difficulty for new players. It's a board game of sorts directly ported to a video-game... But as it usually happens, good board games are complex as all hell, and that translates poorly for new players. It also doesn't help that the difficulty spike is directly at the start: you create your own team and then suddenly you're thrusted with little knowledge of how to play against teams that actually DO HAVE QUITE THE LEVEL ALREADY. Your team will be on a sick losing spree from the beggining because, even though the game says there's around 140 or so teams on the game, you'll be playing against the same mid-level ones over and over. If I start on a 0 prestige league, WHY THE HELL PUT MID-GAME TEAMS ON IT, EVEN ON THE LOWEST DIFFICULTY!? IT'S STUPID. However that's switched around later, when your team actually gets levels and becomes decent, the enemies are actually rather easy to predict.The second other problem this game has is actually related to that one, too. Remember when I talked about this game being a board-port with tons of rules? Well, this game has a tutorial that last around 10 minutes and all it does is teach you how to move characters, knocking people into the ground and the bare minimum to start playing. It's kinda pathetic when the game has so many damn rules and can be so damn challenging and outright painful to play for new players. The worst part of it all is that I did a bit of research online, and on the Steam forums some people say that to understand the game correctly you gotta read the manual, and also giving a link to a PDF file of said manual... WHICH HAD OVER 50 BIG PAGES OF RULES. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥. IT'S A F#CKING VIDEOGAME, NOT A SCIENCE PROJECT!Taking that aside, though, what do we have left? A really fun and adicting game, once you actually learn what the f#ck you're doing.The gameplay, after you learn about it and get over the start difficult spike, is fun as all hell. Now sure it feels lame when the enemy team pulls off something completely stupid that somehow works, like a ball carrier somehow dodging three players and scoring a touchdown, but all races have their own advantages and styles of play. Wood elfs for example are great at doing large passes and evading blocks, however they just S#CK at melees and end up with multiple injured and DEAD players at them. On the other hand you have guys like the Orcs and Dwarfs, who are violent and while not having much control over the ball, can just win by injuring and killing other players. IT'S LIKE MADDEN MIXED WITH WARHAMMER, ONLY ACTUALLY FUN!Talking about races, there's like 30 or even more of them, lost count. That's A LOT of variety, I'm pretty confident anyone can find a race that fits their playstyle, me actually going Dwarf because F#CK YOU, YOUR STAR PLAYER IS NOW DEADER.The multiplayer is also fun. I've only played one match so far online but it was so fun and competitive that I can see myself going back to it once in a while.Lastly, the commentators are actually quite fun to hear, as they comment on the races of each team, their characters and such. It sucks that the variety of quotes for each one of those is quite low, but hey, can't have everything.Do I recommend this game? It depends. If you like board games and have tons of patience, then you'll have lots of fun with the game. If however you don't have much of that, stay away FOREVER. The game is HARSH with new players that don't have any damn idea what this game is all about. It also doesn't have Steam Overlay support, which is stupid.TL;DR Edition: Fun board game ported into an actual video-game. The learning curve and difficulty spikes are some of the most harsh ones for new players, however once you learn about it you'll have tons of fun with it. And the multiplayer is fun too, still with players on it.			"

												It´s very difficult to recommend this game, because is a turn based game that uses dice rolls to decide the outcome of all actions you make. The problem is that the dice rolls are wrong. They sould throw random numbers, but this is not the case. Dice rolls usually favour the computer player.The game seems to have broken mathematics and maybe some bugs. You can make limited re-rolls to avoid bad rolls, but usually this re-rolls do not have effect, as they throw exactly the same result too many frecuently.Also, in some situations, you get low probabilty results (like doubles when making a foul) with a very high frequency.Get it only if you plan to play exclusively online against human players. Against the computer, the game is totally frustrating due to the AI cheats/bugs.			"

												One has to be a die-hard GW fan to appreciate it through all the little irritations this game provides, which pile up in to a massive pain in the rear. Tutorial teaches nothing in a game based on 100500 detailed moves. Autosave is non existant, and one will assume that there is an autosave, because the manual one is hidden so deep that it will take you a few restarts of the campaign to realize where it is. Crashes, glitches etc. It was cute at first but now its just frustrating.			"

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #26 - Blood Bowl: Legendary EditionI had heard of Blood Bowl, and knew it was based on a tabletop game, but otherwise I did not know anything about it.  So going in, I had no idea what to expect.Since I hadn't played before, I started with the tutorial, hoping it would help me understand how to play the game.  After waiting awhile for it to load (longer than I would have expected), it opens with a pair of commentators to explain the rules of the game, with some groan-worthy humor thrown in.The tutorial starts out simple enough by explaining the basic camera controls, and how to change cameras.  Then it covers ""tackle zones"" and placing your teams starting positions for the kick off.  It also explains the concept of re-rolls, which allow you to re-roll a die result, with each team only getting a limited number of these.But things quickly get complicated once the actual gameplay starts.  The game is filled with all of these different skills that players can have.  Each skill acts as a conditional modifier, depending on the situation.  For example, when picking up the ball, the game will ""roll a die"" and if the roll is too low, then you'll fail to pick up the ball.  But, if your player has the ""Sure Hands"" skill, then the player gets a second roll when the first one fails.It seems that pretty much every action in the game has one of these skills associated with it.  If I try to pass the ball, there's a 'Pass' skill that lets you re-roll a failed roll.  The game also starts talking about stats like Agility, and some kind of ""Agility Table"" that is used for skill checks, but apparently you have to read the rules to see that.Next the tutorial moves onto blocking and pushing past defenders.  Now even more skill checks are coming into play.  Here the roll is based on the Strength stat, and not only are there skills for influencing the block result, but also whether or not players get injured or not.As the tutorial continues into movement, dodging and blitzing, and even more die rolls and skills, I can feel my eyes starting to glaze over.   By the time the tutorial gets to the first turnover, I am pretty much lost.  I'm just kind of reading and nodding along at this point.  Just to give an idea of how quickly the tutorial starts piling on skills, here's one of the things it tries to explain to me:  ""Since Krug Painspear has the tackle skill, Jean-Paul mussen is knocked down with a 'Defender Stumbles', even though he has the Dodge skill, which would normally allow him to regard that as a simple push-back.""The commentators swear that although it sounds complicated, it's all really easy after a few games.  I'm not so sure.  I'm reminded of this episode of Star Trek where Kirk has been captured by these gangsters, and he introduces them to a card game called Fizzbin.  Only the game doesn't exist, and Kirk is making up the rules as he goes, and the gangsters are completely confused as Kirk tries to explain the game.  That's exactly how I felt after finishing the tutorial.So clearly there is a learning curve here.  So it comes down to whether or not it's worth spending the time to learn the game.  If you are a fan of the board game, then it seems pretty obvious you'll enjoy this as well.    If you like tabletop war games in general, and aren't intimidated by rules, then it's also likely you'll enjoy this.  But if you are more of a casual player, then this game will likely go right over your head as it did mine.			"

												Graphically, whilst it doesn't look amazing, it does look good and the character models are very nice. Sadly, that is where the positives end. Given that they only really had to implement the rules of the table top game with some net code, I didn't think they could mess things up, but it really appears as though they did their best to give the user the very worst experience imaginable. It felt as though they put in very little effort from a UI perspective. No excuse for such a shoddy menu system in this day and age. The menus were slow and clunky and navigating between pre-match screens took overly long. Also, I found it impossible to set up a 1 off game with a friend over the net. The only clear way to play against each other was to set up a league and we weren't allowed to only have 2 teams in the league. Then, creating a custom team was a pain. When I finally gave up trying to play against a human opponent (which was the main reason I bought the game in the first place), I decided to play a match against the AI, so the game wouldn't have been a complete waste of money. The game and AI was very buggy. The game crashed multiple times and during 1 match, after a few turns, the opposing AI team failed to move a single player for 4 consecutive turns and for each of those turns I had to wait for the turn clock to run down so I could take my turn. This is a second rate implementation of an excellent table top game.			"

												An impossibly difficult game which does not allow for the growth of the player. The way this is justified by saying that on 'easy' the opponant moves randomly, 'normal' the computer is overpowered compared to the player to ""increase challenge"", and on 'hard' the computer is impossibly hard. Basically, no matter which strategy you try you will always be beaten by the computer.Two player is alright, but only because a human opponant is not random or super-powered.			"

												Unsurprisingly, everything about the game system is there and feels great. However, the amount of bugs has been (and remains) shocking and the game is currently unplayable - unless you're willing to ignore countless lost saves, stuck positions etc.Just to demonstrate: You've got ONE save per campaign which can last a hundred hours. You got no autosaves, meaning you REALLY got to think about saving. On balance, once in EVERY game you play, things (meaning engine/camera/technical sh*t, not your dice rolls) go t*ts up and you must quit and restart (losing an hour of gameplay at least, since you only can save at certain poitns). And you better pray you rememmer NOT to save before quitting, because otherwise you're saving the bug as well.Result: Unplayable. Believe me, I'm a Blood Bowl vet, I've really wanted to love this game, but technically it's so far beyond failure it's touching Dodo and the Dinosaurs.			"

												This game is terrible.The controls are clunky and un-intuitive, the rules are unnecessarily complicated, the graphics are dated, and it's just no fun; particularly the misnamed ""real time"" play.The announcers are not funny, no matter how hard they try to be. The overall feeling I get while playing it, is either the devs were rushed, or had no love for the game while making it.I wish I had my $8.00 back, but thank god I got it on sale.I was expecting the kind of polish that Dawn of War had, taking a tabletop game and making a fun and involved game out of it.This feels like a mod for some other game. A bad mod. One that should have stayed free.			"

												A curious double edged sword is that it doesn't much matter what happens to your team, lose players and your worth adjusts meaning you probably play other, less valuable teams. Prizes for all.The game's reliance on the right mouse button for everything can get a little annoying if you use a laptop like me. I had hoped for a quiet turn based game but was constantly double clicking and requiring the full 2 minute turn left. These are probably necessary evils of the genre and I think I might have to up my game preference to more action oriented.Good for fans of the table-top game, and much cheaper. Team ball game fans should also give it a look, otherwise it could only appeals to lovers of turn based online games, ie games like X-COM do (did) turn based strategy much better and this still feels mired in its pay to win table top origins. 70%			"

												I think I just need to stay away from Games Workshop type games altogether. I'm not going to claim that the game is cheating however, I don't have the time to study each individual opponent player (literally it gives you a timer) and devise a decisive strategy when there are SO many factors involved.  The game just feels overwhelming.  So the mistake I make is just use a common stat compare strategy and go for it.  Granted this is my problem and I'm not giving this game a gripe for it but personally I'm just not having fun.  Its way to frustrating and it is just not my cup of tea.  I'm just not a fan of constant dice rolling, especially digital dice rolling.  If your a fan of the tabletop game then go for it but as a standalone strategy game.... meh, pick it up when its on sale but I can't recommend it if your easily frustrated and angry at life to begin with.

												NOTE: This review is strictly for single-player, as I don't care much for multiplayer to begin with.Very heavily dependent on RNG, which appears to favor the AI much more so than the player. Additionally, the real-time mechanic doesn't seem to count some of the attributes at all, such as AGI when trying to get away from opponents, who more than frequently get to knock down your players, especially teams that rely on brute force like the Orcs or Norse. Can't really run away, and if you fight, your players get KO'd more than they do the KO'ing (if you don't play a brute force team). Unbalanced AI (even on Easy) keeps me from recommending this game. I have a love/hate relationship with this game, which is leaning more towards the ""hate"" side because of how ridiculously unfair the AI is. I call it the ""loaded dice"" algorithm.			"

												This is gosh darn awswome. It is frustating at times, but frustrating in an endearing sort of way. You will also never get closer to the tabletop game and a cheaper version of it. There is also a lot of intricacy between team customization that leads you to figure out the intricate details of how best to beat the game. Another cool feature of this game that it has local multiplayer where you can play with a buddy of yours on the same computer if they don't own it. All and all, I would give this game 8/10			"

												A pretty fun game of turn-based football strategy that is based on the board game with some additional perks.  If you like dice type games and football with orcs and such in a turn-based manner, this is a decent game.  Plus, the commentary is pretty funny too.  It's worth it if you can get it on sale.			"

												It's a Warhammer game, so instantly it's regarded by me as good. Warhammer doesn't usually make bad game. And bloodbowl is no exception.

												NOTE: This review is strictly for single-player, as I don't care much for multiplayer to begin with.Very heavily dependent on RNG, which appears to favor the AI much more so than the player. Additionally, the real-time mechanic doesn't seem to count some of the attributes at all, such as AGI when trying to get away from opponents, who more than frequently get to knock down your players, especially teams that rely on brute force like the Orcs or Norse. Can't really run away, and if you fight, your players get KO'd more than they do the KO'ing (if you don't play a brute force team). Unbalanced AI (even on Easy) keeps me from recommending this game. I have a love/hate relationship with this game, which is leaning more towards the ""hate"" side because of how ridiculously unfair the AI is. I call it the ""loaded dice"" algorithm.			"

Captains Log, 26.10.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Blood Bowl – Legendary Edition. Referee paid! Beer? Bought! Secret Weapons for the sidelines? Activated! Okay, we are set for a round of bloody fantasy football then! Let the blood be spilled!  [I have not tested the real-time gameplay. Consider that while reading the review.]First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]So this is a Warhammer game huh? Okay. But….it is about football! Well, not exactly Football. More like Blood Bowl! This game is really a tactics game with a lot of layers of tactical shenanigans you can get up to if you 1) understand them 2) take time to think about it. The game presents itself as a “favorite sport of orcs, elves and other warhammer races” kind of a turn based sport themed tactical game of quite the challenging difficulty and satisfying gameplay:Being set in the Warhammer Universe Blood Bowl gives the player a choice of different races and factions as a base for the team. Each Team has different skills they excel at, for example smashing heads or running very fast, blowing themselves up or calling for outside help! There is a rulebook included in the game which represents the exact rules for the boardgame parent that this game was fashioned after. And then some more! Because it is not only a conversion (and a good one at that) it is also an expansion because there is a realtime mode and a turn based mode available which changes the game a lot. Sadly though for this review the real time mode couldn’t be tested (will be done as soon as possible)There are different game modes to allow for different sets of gameplay, speed and challenge. A tutorial is include (with fully voiced commentary from of the field-very nice!)It is a game based on dice rolls. But don’t fear! It is not Spacehulk! (See my review for that sad board game sibling) You have enough options and tactical add-ons to prevent the dice roll to be all deciding. There are of course situations in which you still cringe….that is just the thing with the dice. (I guess at this point it is: take it or leave it)That being said: It is a very complex, intriguing, diverse, entertaining and challenging game of sports themed warhammer based strategy with so many layers that a regular onion starts to get jealous.Look and feel and sound: There are announcers in the game, they comment on certain moves, mistakes and outcomes of the game. The music is really well done. The sound effects, while not overwhelming, are solid enough to not distract from the game. The graphics are fitting, while not overwhelming. Camera controls are perfect and the game creates a nice atmosphere of actually standing at the sidelines and commanding your werewolf runners to “blitz that puny elf out or I’ll gut you like chickens after the game” *coughcough* I mean…you feel drawn into the game at a satisfying level. For me at least that was the case. In a good way.Captains Orders:You don´t have to be a sports game fan to like blood bowl, but it might tip the scales in you favour if you are. If you are into complex rules behind a pretty straightforward game concept (meaning you can just start playing and get better with each game)  then Blood Bowl serves your cravings. If you like Warhammer as a theme, it is a bonus. Not necessary! Verdict: Cargo!  It is a game that you have to invest some time into to get the rules and figure out your own tactics. It is really not for in-between. So for me, due to lack of time, I will have to wait until I touch this solid tactics game again. But I will. Definitely. And then I might even try the RTS Mode that exists!

												Clunky and ugly with an incoherent tutorial that reads more as a virtual companion to the tabletop game than as a standalone alternative. Fans of Blood Bowl in its physical form will find its digital counterpart to be playable, and some may even be able to take some kind of enjoyment from what is essentially a high-quality Breast/Cloth/Grass physics simulator. The game features a multiplayer option that doesn't seem to work in the off-chance that you find some kind of third-world orphan or withered hermit with a computer, an internet connection, and literally nothing to do except play this ♥♥♥♥ing game, who wants to play with you. The graphics are ugly and the menu design is confusing and overall this game reeks of ""Barry from Public Relations knows how to make low-quality games, lets start a company and obtain the license to an obscure Games Workshop property and ♥♥♥♥ it up"".Overall, high-tier Amazonian breast-jiggling and Grass swaying - that's about it.3 out of 18 stars.

												Poor AI takes away from what fun is to be had. Interesting game, but the AI makes it near impossible to play. They have issues picking up the ball, issues catching, and issues scoring as a team. The enemy AI on the otherhand has no issue with this and catches a pass perfectly, runs the right way, and has smart routes. While some people like the AI to have an advantage there is a difference. As your team can not actually play the game itself and you will find yourself losing for stupid reasons. I'd save yourself the time, money, and the frustration.			"

												I Like Bloodbowl and have played the wonky xbox 360 version (even worse!) , boardgame and recent cardgame. I would not recommend this Pc port though - as its lazy, there is no keypad support and very little options you'd expect from a pc game.. I've come to expect money-grubbing terrible gameplay from Games Workshop, as Blood bowl is one of the few game rules sets that is playable in their franchise..

												As a game that tries to faithfully re-create the mechanics of the table-top game of Blood Bowl, this game does a good job. It is not, however, a football game with a fantasy setting; and it is this point that frustrated me the most. As someone who had not played the table-top game before, much less possessed any skill at it, I found making effective use of the mechanics in this game hard and the results were disappointing due to the very steep learning curve; successes were rare and offset by the frustrating ease with which failure occurred for even the simplest of tasks, and with little in-game guidance it was very difficult to even grasp at what I was doing wrong. What I have since learned is that this is not really a game about strategy with random elements, but rather ongoing mitigation of the high randomness that occurs turn-to-turn; and that just rubs me the wrong way.If you enjoy the table-top Blood Bowl game and/or you are very familiar with its rules, you'll probably enjoy this game. If not, this is likely to leave you just as frustrated as it left me; save your money for something else.			"

												DO NOT buy this game because it has a warhammer title. Do some research on how the game mechanics work, it is turn based not action or entertainment based.After an agonizingly long tutorial you realise how bland and boring this is without even a hint of the epicness  you might expect from a warhammer game. The character models are awesome, but that's about the only thing I enjoyed about this game.The announcers are probably the single most worst feature of this game.			"

												You can liberally call this a 1:1 translation from a old (and not exactly small) boardgame into a PC-game. I never played the original game, but the interface feels nice and is easy to use. Which doesn't mean the rules ares easy to grasp (they're definitely not simple). But the game contains a basic tutorial and THE COMPLETE RULEBOOK in text form. Ye, that's 50 pages to read, but if you're a fan of Dice-RPGs, you will love it.Be warned though, as a dice-based action sport RPG, it is HIGHLY random and brutally unfair at times.Other then that, a nice pick up that can, if you are thoroughly interested, be a cheap pay for hundreds of hours.

												Others would say this game is a good one, but I say, nope.Here's why:RNG is not random at all.  There's no random anything, because I've seen dice rolls before, for this game on table top, and they aren't nearly this one sided even in the worst of cases (mini wargaming has videos with them playing this table top version, and even then they aren't nearly this bad).Difficulty setting?  No reason to lie, its hard, extra hard, might as well not play.  Actually, I'm wrong, it goes: don't bother, don't bother, don't bother.No change to difficulty changes any part of the game.  Meaning that you put it on easy?  It's still going to bend you over, put it on hard, it still, guess what, bends you over.  They make dodge after dodge, gfi after gfi, single dice blocks and double against and nothing happens.  The player?  First dodge fails, or second dodge fails (I haven't done double dodge moves because of this), single dice blocks are attacker down 90% of the time, rerolled into attacker down or both down, and double against?  Might as well buy another player at that point.This is the worst case of RNG I have seen in a game, in forever.  There's no reason the dice couldn't be actually ballanced or the rolls be actually random.I wouldn't buy anything from this dev, so long as it's a game that's supposedly an adaption of a table top game.  Since they have BB2, and the reviews are down right ugly for that game, I will not be purchasing or playing this game again.And if you've gotten this far, and wonder how someone could say such things about this game without playing it for a while?  Look at how many hours I've logged, and you can see I have given this game way more time than it actually deserves.1/10.  The one is for graphics, since these, although clunky and weird at times, do make the game look semi nice.I urge you, as a final note, not to get this game if you haven't already, and if you have, don't get BB2, you can read their reviews and see the issues, but lets face it, they took a turd, polished it, and handed it back to you...  What's that saying?  Polish a turd, its still a turd?			"

												This is usually my type of game, and I'm very forgiving of games in this type of genre and style.  I just thought I'd precursor saying that, because with that in mind - this is without a doubt, one of THE WORST GAMES I have EVER had the unfortunate displeasure of playing in my entire life.  I had seen some generally unfavorable reviews of the game but ignored them for the most part because I figure the general public usually wouldn't like a niche game like this.  I should have listened to them, and you should listen to me if you don't want to make the mistake of throwing your money toward one of the most unenjoyable trash games ever to be created.I don't even know where to begin.  Forget the steep learning curve of the game.  You can learn everything there is to learn about this game and it still won't be fun.  Unless you find having a guy who's wide open 2 squares away unguarded from an unguarded passer both with a ""passer"" skill and the receiver with a ""cather"" skill and still having the ball fall to the ground, ending your turn (because anytime you have something go ""wrong"" in this game, your entire turn ends.  Fun huh?)  then witnessing the enemy come up, pick up the ball, run through your entire defense and not get taken down at all and score at will - fun!If you like watching a ball get kicked off right to the ground beside your receiver who has ""sure hands"" skill, and still watching them try to pick up a ball and have it fumble off and end your turn again, then watch the enemy just jump through your defense and pick up the ball before you can even pick it up as you fumble turn after turn after turn in this awful sorry excuse for a game.Got a player that you really enjoyed having on your team?  Spent money on the ""apothecary"" (which is basically suppose to be something that prevents 1 injury to a player per game, of which there will be many) so you don't want your favorite star player to die and be gone forever?  Oh dont' worry, it won't do you any good.  I've played probably around 50 games and not ONCE has the apothecary ever worked when trying to heal someone.  Do you enjoy using tactics and strategy to win games?  Then this is not the game for you.  Do you enjoy having literally every simple stupid thing chocked up to the luck of a 6 sided die, that mysteriously the AI will always have go their way and you never will?  This is the game for you then.Do you enjoy halftime periods that are so awkwardly timed that any chance at having an exciting end to a game or half will without fail ALWAYS end before you can actually have... you know.. FUN at a game, and instead just end up thoroughly disappointed because you never get to witness anything awesome in this game?  This game is also right up your alley then.Do you enjoy having every little thing chocked up to D6 rolls, even the winnings when you actually are so fortunate to have won a game, your level ups when your players are lucky enough not to have died on the field or had a game ending injury, or literally every single kickoff of the game having some random event sway the game in your opponents favor, even if you have all the ""stats"" such as twice as many cheerleaders as the opponent and twice as many assistant coaches?  Once again, I've got a game for you - Blood Bowl, Legendary EditionThe only thing Legendary about this game is how awful it is.  There is ZERO fun to be had in this game, only frustration pain and suffering.  May the developers of this game be ashamed to have ever put something this god awful out on the market and actually profit from it.  Such a cool concept for a game, hopefully someone else will attempt to make similar games.  Without a doubt it wouldn't be hard at all to top this gutter trash of a game.0/10, there is literally NOTHING redeemable about this game.  At least most awful games can have something good said about this, but not this one.  Avoid this game, no matter who you are, unless you are a masochist.			"

												Blood Bowl je igrica sa fenomenalnom idejom, izvrsno zamišljena igrica i stvarno ima potencijala.Međutim izvedba je katastrofalna, nakon nekog vremena kada ćete htijeti pobjediti malo teže protivnike (normali/hard) naići ćete na prepreku. Recimo jedan scenarij: kaos protiv wood elfova. Kaos je moja ekipa. Ja sam kiker i super opalim loptu ode na suprotni kraj terena od onog koj sam naciljao ali nema veze to je tak svejedno kuda lopta ode, pripisujem to šlampavosti mojeg kikera. i sad njegov wood elfe hvata loptu bezprjekorno i preće u marš na tuch down. meni u prvoj sekundi onesvjeste minotaura i još jedno od opakijih tipova. Ok nema veze pošaljem 4 obrambena igrača na napadača i napadač mi s jednim udarcem sruši 2 od moja 4 obrambena igrača. ostala dvojca ga dovoljno zadržavaju da dođe jos 4 mojih igrača minotar se osvjestio. Padaju još dva moja igrača od strane istog napadačkog igrača. Minotaur dolazi u bitku njegov napadač je sada okružen sa 6 mojih igrača od čega ih je 3 u nesvjesti, a jedan je minotaur. napadač udara mog minotaura i zadaje mu teške ozljede da nemože igrati do kraja utakmice. nakon 2 minute intenzivnog mlačenja napokon uspijem rušiti napadača. Pošaljem svojeg napadača po loptu. isklizne mu iz ruku, pošaljem opet, izklizne mu iz ruku. sada je več prošlo 20 sekundi hvatanja lopte po terenu sakupilo se 4 protivnička igrača oko mojeg bjednog jednog kada je uspio uhvatiti loptu. Brzo loptu šalem preko da izbjegnem napad protivnika. lopta uspješno poslana protivnik ne presjeca loptu.... lopta mojem igraču koj ju hvata ispada iz ruku. prošlo je 15 sekundi dok je moj igrač podignuo loptu s poda svi protivnici več e okupljaju oko njega. pokušavam dodati loptu kada mi ispada iz ruku. Ponovo pokušavam podignuti loptu nakon 5 neuspjelog pokušaja, lopta odlazi protivniku pod noge, on ju iz prve podiže napravi uspješno dodavanje, njegov suigrač besprjekorno hvata loptu ja šaljem svoju vojsku na njega (kažem vojsku jer šaljem 6 igrača). prvi pada gotovo u sekundi drugi se drži neko vrijeme no on isto pada. nakon pol minute borbe mojh 6 igrača ruši njegovog jednong nakon što ih je meni palo 4. napokon trčim u napad. Prvi obrambeni igrač protivnika ruši mog napadača u jednom hitcu, no mog napadača je pratilo 5 ljudi, tako da u roku od 40 sekundi uspjevam vratiti loptu na moju stranu, zapravo na pod gdje ostaje idučih 15 sekundi. Oke moj igrač napokon hvata loptu i trči prema liniji nakon što je njegovih 4 kolege onesvješteno i pada mrtav wood elfe ga je u jednom udarcu ubio dslovno ubio. super sada imam 9 od 11 igrača do kraja tekme jer mi je minotaur ozljeđen, a jedan igrač mrtav...... da ne opisujem dalje na kraju uspjevam protivnika dobiti sa 7/5 rezultatom (otkrio sam taktiku da ako sve igrače krečeš skupa ko hordu su jači i možeš čak doči do kraja).Igram 2 utakmicu i sve se ponavlja iz početka računalo pokazuje nadmoč no ja sa taktikom glavom kroz zid upjevam dobiti i drugu utakmicu u sezoni...Započinjem 3 utakmicu sve isto komp vara  ja sve svoje držim na hrpi i ovaj put uspjevam izvuč cak 11/2 ostalo je svega 25 sekundi do kraja imam zagarantiranu pobjedu. No igrica je imala drugačiju viziju od mene, te se rušu 25 sekundi preije kraja tekme.Ponovno palim igricu i idem loadat, kad shvatim da nisam saveao, a igrica nema auto save niti ga je moguče upaliti.Sav moj trud je izgubljen i gubim volju za daljnjim igranjem ove igrice.

And then, if you manage to log in, you need to search for your friends in order to start a game with them, instead of just going through the Steam Friend List, and again it doesn't always work. Even after you have started a game, both of you can get kicked out in the middle of the match. I really did not have a good time with this, and both me and my buddy feel like we wasted out money.

												This came in a $1 humblebundle I bought for another game. After the awful and uninformative tutorial I still had little of an idea how the game worked when I started a exhibition match. They went way overboard with the rules and overthought this game big time. All that happened when I tried to apply the tutorial rules in a exhibition match was I made two moves that I learned, the screen said ""turnover"", the enemy made about 15 moves, killed 3 of my guys and surrounded my guy that had the ball, then it was my turn, I tried to move my guy away from them, he fell down and died. I think it's something about roll modifiers and rolling a number higher than 3 and 4 to make handoffs and passes and blocks, but take that and complicate it with about five more layers of rules and you have this game.It requires a load of rulebook reading since the tutorial didn't help with ♥♥♥♥. That's just what I want to do in my games: spend hours reading a rulebook. Even if I did learn it so what?

												Sorry, I could not reccomend this to anyone.The concept is cool, I mean who would want to play nerdy football with ultra violence? But this, is just plain boring. it takes a fast paced sport game and turns it into a slow paced boring crawl that I couldn't stand. Also its not ultra violent, its football with pools of blood. So if a slow paced, bad in the graphics department, and terrible interfaced game is your thing, go for this, otherwise, stay away.			"

												Never tried the tabletop game before, but fell in love with this straight away. Races play very differently, but still somewhat balanced, a testament to good game mechanics. The slow building up of your team over matches is extremely satisfying! Despite its quirky humour and dependance on dice-rolling, its a fun tactical board game that has lots of depth even as you clock in those hours.			"

												The classic mode is just like the board game, since it essentially is the board game. Having AI opponents is great for when you want to learn how to play and get through a campaign relatively quickly.Since it's based on an already awesome game, I fully recommend this to anyone who likes turn-based RPG-style board games about fake sports in which players are routinely crippled or killed.

												I loved this game, Khemris are so fun to play, crushing other players is SO fun!If you liked the boardgame then you must want to get it already, but for the newbies i'll try to describe why this game is so good. The number of teams is really nice because each team represents different playstyle : the humans are pretty much balanced and you'll be able to throw passes or run through the opponent's line whereas elves' playstyle is based mainly on passes and dodging tackles due to their agility, Khemris will try to litteraly crush the opponent's line to get their holder of the ball to the touchdown because they can't do a single pass while gobelins will play dirty by using unconventionnal weapons during the match such as chainsaws, pogo sticks etc...At the beginning you'll be a little lost if you didn't play the board game because nearly nothing is explained, you'll have to read the rules book and that will take you about 1h to get through this but when you master the rules it gets really fun. You should start by playing the campaign mode because that's how you'll learn most easily.Final flaw : sometimes you just wish to play real american football ^^ (and maybe you'll find the commentaries getting a little bit old after a bunch of hours of game)			"

												If you never played the tabletop version, you will not understand this game. If you never read the actual copy of the Blood Bowl rulebook, you will not understand this game.  If you think the game is confusing, as stated before you probably never played the board game itself, what can you do to play this game without getting frustrated or write a negative review on it? Get the actual rulebook to this  game from your local comic shop or any game shop that specializes in Roleplaying games, or else you'll never understand the gameplay or the rule concept behind Bloodbowl.  All of the elements of the original boardgame, are compressed into a video game, I have spent a few minutes on it and I understand with just by messing with the tutorial.  Again, read the rulebook, it's in the game where you start the tutorial, download the pdf version, or get the actual board game. Or else, you won't get it at all even with played tutorial, and I know people these days don't even bother read anymore.Overall, with time and practice, it can be a very very fun game and a real blast with friends.

												Blood Bowl is an interesting concept and has huge potential, but the single player campaign is punishingly difficult thanks to slavishly following the rules of the board game. Let alone which, the difficulty selection is bass-ackwards; if you set the difficulty to Easy, the opposition will take more chances, and as the game relies on the luck of the dice-roll, this means they'll do better.However, while the randomness of dice-rolling  is a weakness in single player, I could see it being a massive benefit in multiplayer. It's just a shame that I have no desire to play this game competetively whatsoever.			"

												Fantasy sports teams play a supremely violent version of American Football. The actual rules of the game are heavily hidden, making getting into it rather difficult. Because of this, you'll need to spend some time with the manual, which is actually the original board game manual. Somewhat telling, given the nature of the port.But once you get in, it hooks you. A testament to the original game it's based on, though the developers have done a poor job porting it.			"

												Blood Bowl is a computer version of the classic warhammer spinoff that puts midevil races against one another in a football related game. However this sort of game makes rugby look friendly. Mixed with tons of humor (ork cheerleaders, bribing refs, dancing zombies) and loads of potions (over a dozen races), blood bowl is a heck of a customizable experience. However it can be a bit hard to grasp the concepts at first and can be extremly difficult even if you understand the rules, but if you enjoy a tactical challenge, football, fantasy, or warhammer, give it a try!

												Blood Bowl is one of those games that is hard to determine if you should recommend it or not. Humour is good, gameplay isn't bad either, yet sometimes the game gets just too infuriating for some reason. So I'm going to list the pros and cons of this game, and you can make your mind yourself.Pros:Good dose of dark humour from the two commentators.Great variety of teams/races to play with.Different play modes, and you can even edit the rules.Blood, violence, and random, untinkable, kills (an elf single-handedly killing a minotaur? Who knew?)Lots of skills, equipment, etc.Cons:Steep learning curve. Curve is so steep, it could be called a wall. Yes, the tutorial explains most of the gameplay, but there is too much ""For this, reffer to the manual"". Said manual is about 80 pages...Evasion system is maybe too easy. With 4 Agility (base Agi for Agi-based players), there is just about nothing that can stop youBattle system can also be somewhat flawed, as if you are against a strenght-based team, they will only put all their players around the one carying the ball, and due to the odds, you are very unlikely to stop even one of them.Long story short, if you play this game, expect to lose, expect to get frustrated, expect that what you though to be a good strategy was a bad one. If you are unsure, buy this game while on sale, as it often seems to be.			"

												It's pointless to play because the dice server is set up to go on ""runs"", that means good AND bad runs. The result of this is that on a good run you kill the opposing players team he has been building for weeks, and on a bad run the team you have been building for weeks is slaughtered...so you will never be able to get any team going you like becuase sooner or later your best players will die. It is very dumb to set up the dice servers this way and it is the fatal flaw to this game.			"

												Love this game. I know Chaos Edition is the way to go but I wanted to play the storymode and learn the history of the league, and for the sale price it was worth the fun. Think of the story mode as an extended tutorial for those of you unfamiliar with Bloodbowl... because getting used to the nuances of this quirky game does take awhile. The storymode sets simple goals for each match... sometimes you only play half a match... and you master the basics (or in my case re-remember how to play because its been several years since I used to play on my xbox 360). The bad luck rolls will drive you nuts and when your favorite player dies it breaks your heart but hey, that's Bloodbowl! "

												An amazing yet infuriating game set in the Warhammer universe. Blood Bowl takes a turn based approach to American Football and with the help of a unique roster of 20+ races and factions, turns it into a violent and chance based struggle to the endzone. The less patient or and those easier to become enraged at RNG may not like it as you live and die by the dice and a single bad role can turn something as innocent to trying to pick up the ball into a bloodbath with multiple players dead and the enemy right at your endzone for the next turn. However, those that play and enjoy the game will learn and be able to do amazing things like kill the ball carrier, then retrieve the ball with another player, pass it to the team's star gutter runner (if you built a skaven team) and have him run all the way down the field dodging numerous defenders... only to break his neck when he trips in front of the endzone since once again, you live and die by the dice.

												I have been a long-time fan of the Warhammer series and tabletop games, so Blood Bowl was an amazing addition to my library. The game also reminded me a lot of Deathrow, which I played to death on the original Xbox.If you like the Warhammer series, dice-rolling mechanics (as seen in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Dragon Age series), turn-based (or real-time) strategy, football, and bloody, brutal mayhem, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are pretty good - there is a fair amount of detail put into the character models. There is not much customization for the different characters - you can change their colors and equip higher level equipement once they meet the reuirements (this takes a long time). The music and sound effects are great and add to the violent and competitive atmosphere. The controls are not too complicated as you will mostly be using the mouse, however, the learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially if you are unfamiliar with dice-rolling being a core element of the game (it only uses 6-sided [d6] die vs. the 20-sided one used in other tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons, so it isn't too complicated) and turn-based strategy games. There is a lot to take in, and playing through the tutorial is strongly advised, even if you are a veteran. Guides, walkthroughs, and wikis will help you out a lot if you get overwhelemed or lost, and I have used some beginner guides myself to determine which team to start off with. Try not to be too deterred by constant loses - your team will improve with experience and you will learn better strategies as you continue playing.You can play a single football match, a campaign mode, or ""story"" mode, where you act as a coach for your team. Be advised, even on the easiest difficulty, the game has an absolutely brutal start. If you are used to playing sports games, you will understand that, as a new team, losing is completely normal (and expected). You can also choose to play in real-time vs. turn-based, and I would suggest turn-based to begin with. There is also an option for a quicker, playstyle or the original rules used in the actual tabletop Blood Bowl that the game is based off of.Before you begin, you must select your team - each having distinct playstyles and different strengths/weaknesses. Many guides will recommend you play as the undead, as they are the most well-balanced team (especially in the beginning). Speedster teams like the Elves (and their variants) excel at dodging and run + gun strategies, however, you can easily be knocked out by stronger opponents. That being said, teams like the Ogres or Goblins risk being left in the dust of speedy opponents. Once you select your team, you will have a set amount of money to purchase players (having substitutions is very helpful and highly recommended), as well as other aids like coaches and cheerleaders (these provide a boost during turnovers).In the pre-match screen, you are able to use pocket money to purchase buffs for yourself, or debuffs for your opponent. Examples include: a wizard who can ""try"" (again, success all depends on your dice roll) to damage the enemy team, potions to illegally enchance your players, or bribes to swing the referees' favor in your direction. You can also pay to have random tests on enemy players (they will be unable to play the match if they are caught using illegal enchancements), or purchase rioting fans that will attack any fans for the opposing team.During gameplay, you are able to move everyone on your team depending on their Movement Points. A critical mechanic to be aware of is how turnovers work: turns will automatically end if you fumble, fail to pick up the ball, or have one of your players knocked down (all of these conditions also apply during the AI's turn). This allows for very deep strategy, as it is sometimes more pertinent to have your defending player knock both him//herself and your opponent down to force a turnover (say, if your opponent is close to scoring a touchdown). Whenever you roll, you will be able to select 1 dice from your resulting roll, so attacking with players who have more die (3 instead of just 1) is highly advised. You can buy team rerolls that are extremely helpful (ex: if you are on offense and roll two ""attacker downs,"" meaning you will have your player fall down and cause an immediate turnover, you can try to roll for better results). Most players will waste a turn to stand up (unless you have a ""jump back"" skill that allows you to move after standing up).The strategy in the game is excellent, as can gain flanking bonuses, blitz once during your turn (otherwise, you can only attack if there is an enemy next to your player), and select different skills when your players level up. An example of a useful skill is ""block,"" which allows a player to ignore a ""both downed"" dice result (only your opponent will be downed). If both the attack and defender have ""block,"" then no one is downed and the turn continues. Positioning is integral to success in this game, as units cannot simply move away from other players' ""tackle zones"" - a dodge roll has to be issued to determine if the unit can successfully move away from a nearby player. Dodge rolls must be calculated for each unit that has a tackle zone aroun the moving character (so ""caging,"" or trapping key players - like the ball carrier - is a viable strategy)Games last for 16 turns for each side (32 in total), and there is a timer during each turn so you cannot just idle around.I really enjoyed this game, but I must warn people that you may find the game too slow or too boring if you are not used to games that incorporate dice-rolling into everything. You could still try real-time mode instead, but be aware that you do not completely control the outcome of your actions - chance plays a heavy role in Blood Bowl.If you like tabletop (especially dice) games, football, Warhammer, and strategy, and challenging AIs, then1 you should definitely give this game a try.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Warning: this game will make you RAGE. That said, it's very enjoyable, and multiplayer is more fun than playing against the simple-minded AI. There's plenty of teams, at least one is likely to fit your playstyle, and it's a strategy/RPG/sports game mix that is at least worth trying out. Why the warning at the beginning? There are just some matches you'll play where you'll have your star player with the best stats and most points get killed permanently by some rookie player who is nowhere near as good. There's matches where you will never roll the option to knock the opposing player's units over and instead just push them around or knock out your own unit and their unit. That sort of stuff.			"

												I loved this game, Khemris are so fun to play, crushing other players is SO fun!If you liked the boardgame then you must want to get it already, but for the newbies i'll try to describe why this game is so good. The number of teams is really nice because each team represents different playstyle : the humans are pretty much balanced and you'll be able to throw passes or run through the opponent's line whereas elves' playstyle is based mainly on passes and dodging tackles due to their agility, Khemris will try to litteraly crush the opponent's line to get their holder of the ball to the touchdown because they can't do a single pass while gobelins will play dirty by using unconventionnal weapons during the match such as chainsaws, pogo sticks etc...At the beginning you'll be a little lost if you didn't play the board game because nearly nothing is explained, you'll have to read the rules book and that will take you about 1h to get through this but when you master the rules it gets really fun. You should start by playing the campaign mode because that's how you'll learn most easily.Final flaw : sometimes you just wish to play real american football ^^ (and maybe you'll find the commentaries getting a little bit old after a bunch of hours of game)			"

												As someone who used to play Warhammer tabletop, yet only knew about Blood Bowl by name, I picked this up in a steam sale out of curiosity. I recommend to pick it up in a sale if it's the thing that tickles your fancy.In a nutshell: I'd describe it as a turn based strategy game that relies heavily on positioning and risk management mashed together with an (american)football manager.Learning curve: While I first needed to get the hang of the way the mechanics work (how often I cursed at my players not being able to pick up or throw the ball forward), through trial and error I managed to grasp the game mechanics to the point where I'm now winning games vs the AI (btw, the tutorial - it does nothing. Try hotseat for your first games). This is the sour apple you'll have to bite through. So on to the game's selling points:Pros:+In campaign mode - build your team from scratch and level up your players to grant them skills or (for Chaos/Nurgle/Skaven - mutations) to flesh out your playstyle.+Lots of teams+Great commentary (really, the comments add a lot to the game)+There are inducements and things you can pay for like cheerleaders/coaches, bloodweiser babes, halfling cooks, bribes, potions and even the help of a wizard hidden in the audience.Cons:-Progression feels a bit slow; you'll need to be succesful at a couple of matches to earn your first skill for one player and a match can take an hour.-Some of the inducements seem a bit underwhelming and their use is not apparent unless you do a little bit research (example: having cheering fans without a wizard supposedly does nothing)-Randomness of the dice - If all the rolls go right for the opponent you can still end up staring powerlessly as your opponent slips through your tight defense.-This game requires a certain taste. Some may find this dull or too frustrating.-Some might consider the graphics to be too poor at this day/age (in which case, I'd suggest looking out for BB2), though I wasn't bothered (except by the audience ;))			"

												Blood Bowl is an odd game. One I have become obcessed with and infuriated with at the same time. It calls its self a strategy game but yet so much of it is left up to luck and dice rolls ( dice you can't see btw way just told the out come of ) It makes the game mind numbingly hard . 9 hours in I have won 1 match and draw more often than win or loose. That is on easy . Right when you think you are about to win the luck of the dice seem to snatch victory away from you. The worst possible thing that could happen does happen ( way to often ) even if you did everything right. in spite of it I do still have fun with the game . Though I wish the difficulty and learning curve where not so steep. The devlopers just assume the player has played the table top verision of the game , this is even reflected in the rule book , Which tells you to use rulers and charts to decide out comes of dice rolls...... yeah. Pick up this game only if you like crushing difficulty and strategy games			"

												The game blood bowl is very enjoyable for any warhammer fan or just the common gamer it has a turned-based mode in which the player must use his or her mind to strategize the turned vase mode is a lot longer than most players are used to. Real time mode plays a lot more like standard American football time wise and the game is a bit more fast paced and more fun some might say.

												Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition is a fantasy football video game with the option for turn based or real time game play. This game is an expansion to Blood Bowl that was developed in 2009 by Cyanide and published Focus Home Interactive and is based on the board game ""Blood Bowl"" that is produced by Games Workshop.Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition has a great variety of game modes available for both single player and multiplayer that will keep you entertained for days providing the dice gods don't come down on you too harshly.It is however recommended that you play using Classic mode and playing using turn based due to the fact that blitz mode is an awful edition to the game since it does not fit in well and functions clumsily.There are a 20 races to choose from in Blood Bowl chaos edition and helps to add a nice variety to the teams for come up against, some races share similar players but overall there is a lot to choose from and picking what team you want to play as can take quite some time.It is recommended that you purchase Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition due to it having a similar price depending where you purchase it from and adding an extra 3 races for you to play.Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition graphics are perfectly suitable for what it is trying to achieve and generally looks visually pleasing and adds a fair amount of detail into the surroundings and units, for a game made in 2009 you defiantly can't complain about the graphics.On lower difficulty settings the AI make irrational moves that tend to lead to costly mistakes, while the higher levels of AI provide some challenge but you most likely will want to look for opposition using multiplayer.If you want a faithful recreation of the board game Blood Bowl this is the only video game you should currently choose to try out due to the fact that it is quite high quality and is a quite compelling experience overall.I highly recommend that you give this game a try if you like a challenging board game-esque strategy game.Rating - 8 - A must buy!           Advantages	           - Compelling Game play                   - Lots of variety- The best of its kind on the market         Disadvantages- Irrational AI at lower difficulties			"

												A wonderfull game with many hours of fun to be had. You can choose to play it like the old boardgame for a nostalgia boner, or play it in the Blitz mode with alot of new features including a real-time version. The real-time version suffers a bit, seeing as it's just to darn easy to win; however I'd like to add ""To each, his own"".Some races are easier to play than others, but the others make up for it in the meta game with excellent utility and characteristic playstyles. With the latest additon they fixed the only major flaw of having so few races to play.In short, it's a great game whether playing alone or with friends. You are going to have a bloody good time. Happy smashing.			"

												I originally played the retail version of the Dark Elves edition a year or so ago, but have recently invested in the new-and-improved ""Legendary Edition"", seeing as friends of mine had purchased it during a sale, and my interest in the game had been reignited over the past couple of months prior to getting it.Anyway, what can I say? It's essentially American football gone right; out with the Americans, in with everything else! (Including lots of violence!) With Dwarves, Norse, Lizardmen and many more, this game has certainly got a lot of variety! (And did I mention violence?) But what's that? You don't like turn-based games? Well, the real-time blitz mode will fix that!It's genuinely got a team/playstyle for everyone; Want to grab the ball and run? Go Skaven! Want to throw the ball - AND CATCH IT? Go Elves! Want to just kill, smash and burn? Go Chaos! Want to have a horrible time? Go Halflings! Want to be boring and have no specialty? Go humans!Fun for all the family! Buy now!			"

Based pretty well on the original board game, it is a solid attempt to recreate the fun of the dice rolling version.  A wide choice of race types, with enough variety to suit almost any style of play.  Several different settings, and fairly straight forward interface.  The way you level up experienced star players allows specialist development, and giving them names of your choice allows you endless oppertunity for self congratulation or giving a friend a ribbing.

												This is a tricksy game for me to recommend outright, but only because of the price. I picked it up in the Steam sale for £8.99 (iirc) and for that money I would say ""don't miss it!"". Turn based, simple concept, yet very complicated in the hands of skilled players, it's a rare game which has a long term draw. A cursory understanding of dice probability will be of some help for those (like me) who might quit in a rage with the words ""cheating computer!""   Long term players unanimously denounce the single player AI as useless although coming almost from fresh I'll say it's enough to give you the basic concepts and will punish mistakes. There plenty of online leagues for you to cut your teeth on - the ideal place to learn not to get too attached to your players  ;)			"

												Nice turn-based ""american football"" game with warhammer universe characters and tabletop rules.Tabletop rules will take some time to learn so here is short guide of basics:There will be events like picking up the ball from ground, blocking opponent character or moving out of opponents attack zone (all characters has attack zone around them).These events use one of the characters ability to see result of this event, you even succeed or fail in that event.Every time you fail, you lose your turn.Example: Picking up the ball uses characters agility, the lower of your characters agility the more like you will fail picking up that ball, the higher your characters ability the more likely you succeed.Block uses characters strength, the higher your characters strength the more likely you succesfully block opponent character.There is also other factor when blocking, it helps if your other characters are near this target you try to block.Not fully familiar with this rule yet, but it certainly adds your chances up if there is one enemy and he is surrounded by 3 of your characters.Also all characters have attack zone around them.You can enter this attack zone without getting blocked by enemy but when you try move out of this attack zone opponent will try automatically block you, then you need to dodge this block and this dodge uses your characters agility, so higher agility means you most likely dodge this block and wont lose your turn.So that is the basics, there are much more rules and events and you will find yourself from many situations asking yourself questions but also you will find answers for your questions the more you play and meet those situations/conditions again again and again.So characters have abilities like i mentioned earlier.These are:how many squares he can movestrengthagilityarmor value (if this is low your characters will injury more easier and thats always bad)Also these characters level up and gain skills.Few example of skillsBlock skill = Your character wont get knocked down when using ""Both down"" option in blocking situations.(Normally you would lose your turn if your character gets knocked down, but this can prevent it but your enemy is still knocked down, unless he also has this special block skill)Dodge = if you moving out of enemys attack zone and enemy succesfully blocks you, you will try dodge again+ many many more skillsAnyways, i rlly recommend this game.I wasnt sure if this game was for me but i took the risk and im glad i did.Got it cheap while it was on sale.

												You'll spend more time watching this game than playing it. The interface is clunky, the mechanics ponderous, and the dice rolls wholly arbitrary. What should be tactical turns out to be luck-based more often than not, leaving you watching the dim-witted AI labor about the field for another ten minutes.

												This is a tricksy game for me to recommend outright, but only because of the price. I picked it up in the Steam sale for £8.99 (iirc) and for that money I would say ""don't miss it!"". Turn based, simple concept, yet very complicated in the hands of skilled players, it's a rare game which has a long term draw. A cursory understanding of dice probability will be of some help for those (like me) who might quit in a rage with the words ""cheating computer!""   Long term players unanimously denounce the single player AI as useless although coming almost from fresh I'll say it's enough to give you the basic concepts and will punish mistakes. There plenty of online leagues for you to cut your teeth on - the ideal place to learn not to get too attached to your players  ;)			"

												I love this game.  It makes the board game come alive on the computer.  The narrators are quite funny (if repetitive).  If you liked the board game, get this.  For those with no experience, bear with it and learn the basics.  This game is a fun strategy game.  However, the multi player matchup and games are rather lacking.  Too bad.  That would have made this an A+ game in my mind rather than a solid B.			"

												What can I say sports fans.  If you like your fantasy football to include chainsaw's and throwing team mates, beer and violent fans, then this is the game for you.  Based pretty well on the original board game, it is a solid attempt to recreate the fun of the dice rolling version.  A wide choice of race types, with enough variety to suit almost any style of play.  Several different settings, and fairly straight forward interface.  The way you level up experienced star players allows specialist development, and giving them names of your choice allows you endless oppertunity for self congratulation or giving a friend a ribbing.  For those who remember the original, this will be home sweet home.  For those who don't, welcome to the party.  Get scoring!			"

												This could be a good game... if the random numbe rgenerator were good (it's not).  Pretty much the AI will succeed in nearly all dice rolls and you as the human payer will fail a high percentage of the time.  The sad part is the game is not even obvious about it.  Mechanically the game is like Blood Bowl and thus plays like rugby.  That is cool, there are also lots of teams and a fun (in theory) campaign system too build your own team of legend.  Of course the wonky game design applies here, your team will struggle because the opportunity to improve is not well thought out and the face that the game is all but impossible to play thanks to overwhelming CPU advantages... that is a a viscious circle and I have a tough time recommending this game to anyone.

												Blood Bowl is one of those games that is hard to determine if you should recommend it or not. Humour is good, gameplay isn't bad either, yet sometimes the game gets just too infuriating for some reason. So I'm going to list the pros and cons of this game, and you can make your mind yourself.Pros:Good dose of dark humour from the two commentators.Great variety of teams/races to play with.Different play modes, and you can even edit the rules.Blood, violence, and random, untinkable, kills (an elf single-handedly killing a minotaur? Who knew?)Lots of skills, equipment, etc.Cons:Steep learning curve. Curve is so steep, it could be called a wall. Yes, the tutorial explains most of the gameplay, but there is too much ""For this, reffer to the manual"". Said manual is about 80 pages...Evasion system is maybe too easy. With 4 Agility (base Agi for Agi-based players), there is just about nothing that can stop youBattle system can also be somewhat flawed, as if you are against a strenght-based team, they will only put all their players around the one carying the ball, and due to the odds, you are very unlikely to stop even one of them.Long story short, if you play this game, expect to lose, expect to get frustrated, expect that what you though to be a good strategy was a bad one. If you are unsure, buy this game while on sale, as it often seems to be.			"

												This game is probably the only way i could appreciate American Football. Its a really fun game, and as a massive warhammer nerd its strikes a particular cord in me. The game play, though turnbased, is pretty frantic and though its a game taht requires patiance and alot of restrain (from throwing out your PC when your star player dies). You will find this game addicitive i promise. I know BB2 has come out but from what i have seen it doesnt even come close to beating this game besides graphics and the little animations. As your players level up they will learn new skills with which to beat the other team (most often literally) from extra strength to mutations! Its fun is what im getting at, if you want fun, in single player AND Multiplayer, this is the game for you, great value. Because nothing makes me smile more when one of my dwarves slams one of those pansy elves in the ground when they try to dodge past with the ball ;)			"

												1. It's a turn-based game which has a turn timer that can't be turned off. It is hard to come up with a sensible strategy in the limited time available.2. If you leave a match for any reason, even if you save it first, you will get hit with a loss in campaign mode.- Keep in mind that the above is in solo play. So there is no legit reason for the above.3. The AI teams you play against in campaign mode are all a lot better than yours. Going by the ratings that are given, the opposing teams are 50% better, and as I understand it, remain this much better than you even as you improve - and that's a best case scenario. So even if you set up your players in a semi-intelligent fashion, the AI can just dodge past you or run you over, since their guys have a lot more individual talent than yours.I gave Blood Bowl Legendary plenty of time because I usually like games like this, and I really liked the Blood Bowl game that was released in the 90's. But eventually I had to throw in the towel and concede that this game is absolutely terrible. It's the worst game in my library.If you're interested in playing a turn-based American Football style game, check out Frozen Cortex which is a lot better than this.			"

												It's pointless to play because the dice server is set up to go on ""runs"", that means good AND bad runs. The result of this is that on a good run you kill the opposing players team he has been building for weeks, and on a bad run the team you have been building for weeks is slaughtered...so you will never be able to get any team going you like becuase sooner or later your best players will die. It is very dumb to set up the dice servers this way and it is the fatal flaw to this game.			"

												An RNG at its finest. Build a fantasy team from the world of warhammer and have them play ""football"" or just have them kill one another. There is some skill involved, but this is most definitely a game for the pessimists. If you plan for failure you can only succeed, or fail miserably and kill your characters to then waste a roll to revive them. At least then you will be givien the option to have them either be dead or be dead. Seriously though, this will provide you with hours of entertainment, if you play a season mode I would recommend avoiding ""blitz"" mode as there are bugs and unworking features.			"

Going by the ratings that are given, the opposing teams are 50% better, and as I understand it, remain this much better than you even as you improve - and that's a best case scenario. So even if you set up your players in a semi-intelligent fashion, the AI can just dodge past you or run you over, since their guys have a lot more individual talent than yours.I gave Blood Bowl Legendary plenty of time because I usually like games like this, and I really liked the Blood Bowl game that was released in the 90's. But eventually I had to throw in the towel and concede that this game is absolutely terrible. It's the worst game in my library.If you're interested in playing a turn-based American Football style game, check out Frozen Cortex which is a lot better than this.			"

												An RNG at its finest. Build a fantasy team from the world of warhammer and have them play ""football"" or just have them kill one another. There is some skill involved, but this is most definitely a game for the pessimists. If you plan for failure you can only succeed, or fail miserably and kill your characters to then waste a roll to revive them. At least then you will be givien the option to have them either be dead or be dead. Seriously though, this will provide you with hours of entertainment, if you play a season mode I would recommend avoiding ""blitz"" mode as there are bugs and unworking features.			"

												This game is a great turn-based digital version of a superb board game that is a blast to play. In essence, it is a combination of football, dice rolling, and chess.  The rules take some effort to learn but they provide a wide set of strategic options, ensuring endless hours of entertainment. I recommend this game for anyone looking to get a start playing Blood Bowl. Although Blood Bowl 2 is now out, the editions of Blood Bowl 1 (Chaos, Legendary) are a great value since they have more teams/races available.			"

												Ok, once you get past the learning curve and clunky UI, this game is brilliant.Its a mix of addicting gameplay from the original board game, witty banter from the commentators (it adds a LOT to the game) and all the flavor and variaty from the warhammer universe. It is  a game you will find yourself excited with for hours on end alone, and infinately with friends (or at least untill bb2 comes out).At 20$ its a great investment. At any sale, you should jump on it.			"

												Highly recommend this to those interested in Tabletop wargaming. Everything from the original tabletop Blood Bowl game is here except maybe a stray team, but Chaos Edition has the complete set from what I have heard. The campaign and skirmish matches don't have a storyline and fall mainly into a play this to prepare you to play online.If you can find yourself a good group of people to start up your own online Blood Bowl league do so. The game really shines when you have other people to enjoy it with.			"

												What can I say sports fans.  If you like your fantasy football to include chainsaw's and throwing team mates, beer and violent fans, then this is the game for you.  Based pretty well on the original board game, it is a solid attempt to recreate the fun of the dice rolling version.  A wide choice of race types, with enough variety to suit almost any style of play.  Several different settings, and fairly straight forward interface.  The way you level up experienced star players allows specialist development, and giving them names of your choice allows you endless oppertunity for self congratulation or giving a friend a ribbing.  For those who remember the original, this will be home sweet home.  For those who don't, welcome to the party.  Get scoring!			"

												Blood bowl is an amazingly frustrating game. The gameplay captures the experience of the tabletop version almost completely, with one exception: because you do not see the dice being rolled it feels fairly arbitrary when you continually get bad rolls. That being said, this is a game I would encourage any bloodbowl fan to play.			"

												Like Turn-based strategy? Like American Football? You absolutely NEED to give Blood Bowl a try - it's absolutely, mind-blowingly FUN! Pick from a wide variety of teams with different skills, draft players and level them up through the season, and even resort to underhanded tricks like shooting steroids or bribing the officials before a game! There's a whole lot of game here - prepare to be absorbed for weeks and months if it gets its hooks into you. Word of advice - Play those perecentages, as those dice can be brutal. :D			"

												Blood Bowl is one game I keep returning to year after year. It is the right mix of sports management, violence, and turn-based strategy. In fact I enjoy it more than watching actual Football.Regardless of your preferred play style, you are likely to find a race which fits. If you want to play football, the Skaven have the speed and agility to do it. If you just want to bash some skulls, the Dwarves will pound the opponent into the ground. There are plenty of the teams which are a mix of both tactics, and they all have their unique quirks.As with all older games, the graphics have aged, but they still do their job. It would be nice if it were a little easier to tell some units apart, but overall I can't complain.The controls work, for the most part. Unfortunately they don't always seem to register correctly and at least a few times each game something goes wrong because of misclicking. The game can also be slow on occasion, and you may find yourself waiting on the computer to play.Despite its age, this is a fun game. I expect I'll keep playing it until I finally upgrade to Blood Bowl 2 "
