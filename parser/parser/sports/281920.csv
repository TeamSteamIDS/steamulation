AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Splatter - Blood Red Edition Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Action; Top-Down Shooter; Noir; Mindless Fun; Local-Coop My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-8 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary (Local) Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers; Arcade gamers REVIEWSplatter - Blood Red Edition is a simplistic and entertaining top-down shooter with a graphic-noir theme. There isn’t much depth to the gameplay or storyline, but it is pleasantly addictive and has an engaging pace of progress that will suck you in. It is a great game to consider if you are a fan of the genre and are looking for some easily digestible gameplay.The narrative is decent; but really nothing spectacular. But the dark theme and setting of the game is well done and enjoyable. The artwork and cutscenes are pleasantly sculpted in classic graphic-noir style. The atmosphere definitely elevates an otherwise adequate, but lackluster narrative; and together they generate a solid presentation.The gameplay is quite simple. You use one hand to control your character and the other to point and shoot; you can use a controller or a keyboard + mouse. As you progress you will find new weapons and can apply upgrades to make your arsenal stronger. There are also several enemy types, boss encounters, and unique gameplay segments which all help prevent the gameplay from growing stale as you beat the campaign.Besides the campaign, there is also some auxiliary content. This comes in the form of local multiplayer; both PvP and co-op horde mode. If you happen to have any real life friends, you can maybe have a bit of fun with those for a few hours. If you don't have friends, you also can play the horde mode solo and compete on leaderboards.Splatter - Blood Red Edition mostly will appeal to anyone who likes the genre, and is looking for a simple and fun game that is easy to experience. It is the perfect type of game to play if you want to take a break between playing those forty-hours-to-beat, open world epics.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												""Here i find myself in the midst of chaos,but everything breaks if exposed to enough pressure"" listening to that and watching the static cinema that came with it i thought i was in a ""MAX PAYNE"" game,but no i was in the rather enjoyable and action packed shooter that is ""SPLATTER : BLOOD RED EDITION"".Ok when you start to play you wake up in your house and after some rambling to yourself wander of outside,*BANG* bullets everywhere and the army telling you to get of the street you follow them and then you get to find your first weapon the obligatory hand gun (which has infinite ammo,of course it does DUH).As the game progressess you gain acess to more powerfull and impressive weapons (shotgun,rocket launcher ECT) and trust me when i tell you,you are going to need them as some of the boss battles and even some of the normal battles (you do get over run at times) get quite hard and the enemy can overwhelm you if you use the wrong weapon.Now the most easiest and best way to help from getting overcome is to throw a flare,see the dark abomination's you face have a fear and total dislike of the light (""wonder where we have seen this game play element before"" ""i dont know ALAN,WAKE up"") which can give you time to re-gather your thoughts and blow them away whilst they scuttle away from the bright and painfull light that encompasses them.This game play mechanic is one that you will use to your advantage on numerous occasions and will save your neck more than once.As the game plays on you will encounter some puzzles but they are usually of the push button variety and are allways easy to overcome and you will never feel lost as to what to do next and this is a good thing as the action should (and does) take a front seat to all else in game.The graphics in game do a good job and for this sort of game handle really well with no lag no matter how many enemies are on screen (shouldent be in this sort of game),the music in game is good but at times you do find that the spoken dialogue is overshadowed by the music or the gunfire happening in game (minor quibble but i did miss out on some conversations due to this).The story and script are both good and at times you do feel like you are in a different game (MAX PAYNE anyone),but at times it does feel all a little B-MOVIE but actually this is not a bad thing and does suit this game right down to the ground.Will you play this game and would you want to even buy it,well enjoy a game that is all bang for its buck and want something that will itch those trigger finger blues then i would say yes,if that doesnt sound like you and you want more from your game than gun blasting action then i would say look elswhere.In my humble opinion this is one enjoyable blast and i would fully reccomend it just dont expect it to be one of the best games you have ever played just one of the best blasters you have ever played and enjoy it for what it is ""ONE HELL OF A BLASTING GOOD TIME"" "

												One of the best topdown shooters I've played in ages totally worth the price. The story is pretty good compared to most of the games in this genre and I found myself laughing a lot at some of the dialogue between characters, game difficulty is also challenging (I've completed it on normal so far) and plan to go back in on the higher settings. Keep in mind the story is 4-6 hours long but the quality of the content alone is more than worth it!.			"

												It's not as much survival like ""Teleglitch"", nor is it a hell of fun like ""Loaded"" (PS1). *But it's a solid Top-Down Shooter nonetheless with many critters to kill and funny punch lines.* It's not survival with infinite ammo for your main gun and it's not fun when you constantly run out of ammo for the cool guns.

 It's nothing special, but if you dont expect something top-knoch it's a good Game actually The Game is a Top-Down Shooter. You have to Kill zombies. Simple as it is, it's quite fun.I started the game with zero expectations, and was mostly into Idle Games for Cards.If you get this Game in a Sale for around 50 cent or something, you are good to go, even fullprice 2€ are well spend. Or lets say: I spend my money on worse things :D*RECOMMENDED*			"

												For reasons unknown to anyone, my final moments with Splatter saw me facing off against Cthulhu and his many rocket launching ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as I danced around acid pits trying to chop off his alarmingly phallic artillery.I suppose then it goes without saying that Splatter is incredibly, impossibly dumb. It goes far beyond the point of reason with its violence and scenarios, giving you access to an outrageous arsenal and filling the screen with hundreds of enemies at a time, and yet remains entirely blank faced the whole way through. It even tries its hand at juvenile social commentary, which is almost cute in its earnestness. Anytime our gritty, social outcast of a protagonist would open his mouth to growl through a few lines I couldn’t help but burst into laughter, amazed at how all the worst elements of video game narratives had come together in front of me to put on a delightfully awful show.Splatter makes a good case for ironically enjoying media, but underneath the pitiful writing it’s also one of the best twin stick shooters I’ve played in ages. Each weapon feels uniquely powerful and fun to use against the torrents of enemies assaulting you at any given time. There is no greater complexity here than aiming in whichever direction the most enemies are coming from, but it’s a satisfying simplicity that is switched up enough through boss fights and different level designs to stay engaging for the three or so hours the campaign lasts. The impressive lighting effects definitely help, with the splashes of gunshots and explosions completely distracting from the more rudimentary texture work which gives good cause to have most levels take place at night when they are most eye catching.I hadn’t initially intended to play through all of Splatter, and yet I’m more glad to have finished it than even many games I’d consider better. It’s an excellent shooter, and there really isn’t anything quite as hysterical as watching our gruff lead clutch at his fedora and make meaningless asides on the dangers of science and industry. It’s one of the few games I can say I enjoyed both ironically and genuinely, for very different but equally entertaining reasons.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Splatter – Blood Red Edition is a top down twin-stick shooter set right at the outbreak of a zombie invasion.  The game begins as you, Max, wakes up in his apartment with the sound of gunfire and havoc outside...The story while not particularly original, science goes wrong and the result is zombies, is told very well through a series of old school Max Payne like panels and all characters are fully voiced.  The VO is decent and the English translation could use some work, but there is an awful lot of style here in the story-telling.  The best part of the story is there is no Mr/Ms Exposition to be found, all the characters you meet along the way are in as bad a situation as you, knowing very little of what is going on, they are just trying to survive.  The game takes place across more than a dozen levels with optional sub quests and boss fights mixed in. As said, the view is top down and the graphics are very good for the price.  Light plays a huge part in the game-play and is translated very well here, how is bends round corners and through doorways.  Very early on in the game you find yourself overwhelmed and here the primary mechanic comes into play, using light to scare off the zombies via either from ambient sources, or from thrown flares.  Charging head long into a darkened area full of zombies ensures a quick death.  Vehicles also play a part in the game, from riding shotgun on the back of a truck with a machine gun to mowing down the zombies in a combine harvester.There are many guns to pick up, from the initial pistol with unlimited ammo, to grenade launchers, Laser guns, shotguns, flame throwers and more.  All the weapons can be upgraded up to 4 times and the extra damage and abilities will become vital to your survival.  Upgrades come through purchasing them at work benches with cash you collect that is lying around the levels, or inside destructibles.  You can also collect pieces of a golden pistol that eventually provides an extremely powerful upgrade to the pistol.  Since the pistol is the only weapon with unlimited ammo and you can't purchase ammo, only pick it up, the pistol will quickly become your best friend.Things can get very hectic at higher levels and will provide a very good challenge to even the best players.  All in all this is very good example of the genre at the lower price scale and the story will keep you interested to the end.7.5/10			"

												I figured this would be a little, generic Crimsonland-like top-down shooter. MAN was I surprised. It is a clever, funny, brutal, bloody tactical action shooter with RPG-esque bits (leveling your weapons), boss fights, and a story. If you like this type of game, buy this. It is a highly playable, entertaining game with an interesting-enough story to keep you moving ahead for just a bit longer. Max is a hard-bitten, sarcastic mook in a violent zombie-ridden world... so he fits right in. Enjoy!			"

												Didn't know what to expect when I got this, actually, that's a lie. I expected a solid top-down shooter.Turns out, that's pretty much exactly what this is... and not much else.The story is so utterly forgettable, maybe with the exception of the final area/boss, that it's almost an accomplishment. Especially the protagonist, who I'm sure is called Max Blanderson, has 0 character traits beyond the fact that he feels the need to narrate everything as if this was a Film Noir crime novel... except he only ever saw Sin City.All in all there's nothing wrong with this game. It's a fun little romp that clocks in at ~3 hours.There's a decent weapon variety that can be upgraded using cash found around the levels to increase their effectiveness and there's some side quests and collectibles strewn about to make your life easier.Pick it up if you feel like having some simple fun.

												I'm relatively new to using steam for anything other than FM, but have recently fell into the trap of trawling through the specials and sales when they crop up. I stumbled across this game and almost turned a blind eye due to it being 15p! YES! 15p! Now I do casual gaming, but im not an expert. For it's price, even at full amount, this game is an absolute steal. I like the look of top down shooters and this one really doesnt disappoint. I've only invested the last 2 hours into this game, but I was so pleasantly surprised that I thought I better make this game my first review. There is a loose story line, which so far pretty much fits your stereotypical zombie genre. The character you play as is pretty badass and the level blood and guts is there with every kill. I've played Hotline Miami recently and thoroughly enjoyed it, this has a similar feel to it, but with more enemies, leveling up and combined with a great looking backdrop. This review might not help the hardcore gamer, but for people relatively new to steam and indie games, this is the kind of stuff you're looking for, in fact, for 15p this is what everyone is looking for!

												Great top-down shooter, great quality, good story, you could have some fun killing some zombies and other creatures. I loved the detail that when you are low in health the colors turns black and white. The story is short, I guess it took me like 4 hours to finish it. It has a couple of cons:- You can only replay the full story so you can't choose a specific chapter- Your finger will die of clicking so many times when using the revolver :pAlso had a bug in the final boss battle that the autosave was made in the instant I was killed so it entered in a loop, but luckily I had another autosave from a bit before.I really didn't expect much of it, great surprise.

 Nice little shooter, with surprisingly detailed world, Sin City inspired cutscenes and funny dialoque Having just finished the main story on Nasty-difficulty, the highest you can get on the first playthrough i think i've seen most of this game. Maniac difficulty next, you will unlock it after finishing the game.Top-down shooter, plays like you'd think it shuold. Only thing that bothered me in this was how the screen went black and white when my health was down. It made enemies sometimes hard to see, and my cursor was lost there as well because there's a lot happening at times on the levels. Other than that, it was a cool effect. Few deaths because of the unclear screen, but nothing too annoying. That's pretty much the only complaint i have for game. The levels are interesting, they're not too linear, contain secrets (Yes, i am a sucker for hunting secrets in games). Weapons can be upgraded with money you find in the levels (and you guessed it, at the secrets!). Upgrading system is simplistic, you can only buy another level with money to the weapon. It seemed there wasn't enough money to upgrade all the weapons, which is a nice little touch. You shuold choose 2-3 main ones you will be using, otherwise you will end up with only mediocre weapons and the later stages of the game will be way harder.Cutscenes are drawn like panels in a comic book, strongly reminiscent of Sin City comics. We play as a bit too smart-♥♥♥ hero to my liking, but most of the dialoque was positively funny, and seemed to be thought out a bit before starting to make the game. The developer said he was planning to make a sequel, but that idea has been abandoned. Shame, it wuold have been great to have more of this. Especially since the story ended how it ended, shows a sequel was planned. Shuold you buy it?Yes! At 19cents that i paid for it, it's a steal. Quality indie game, cutscenes are great to look at, game is ok fun for 5-8 hours. Survival mode is fun to fire up for a few rounds here and there when you have time to kill.			"

												Yet another zombie game...That's what I thought when I first heard about this game. I've played several games like this and most of them are boring and repetitive.Splatter has something different, new, something that kept my attention. The game is simple but complete and offer everything I wanted from a game like this. It is not a jumpscare game, of course, but you can feel the thriller atmosphere.The game is quite simple, you move, aim and shot zombies. There are some items to help like flares. Collect money that are used for weapon upgrades and the weapons you get from the map just like money and bullets. You will face regular enemies, special enemies and bosses. As you'd expect from a zombie game, regular zombies are no threat if alone but they can provide a real challenge if in crowds.The game presents you some choices that will affect the game for a short period so it is up to you which path you'll take, ""in the end, it doesn't even matter"".You can choose between 3 game modes: History, Multiplayer and Arcade.The Multiplayer is local and you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in total), inside the multiplayer you still have 2 options. Player vs Player (where you can to kill each other) and Coop where you and your friends have to kill the zombies.The Arcade is very challenging, you are supposed to face hordes of zombies that comes in waves. They will drop weapons, bullets and items.Best part, Splatter is translated to Portuguese (not brazilian)8/10			"

												Splatter is a game that I grew immensely fond of. Splatter is that game that is exactly what it sets out to be. It's simple, top-down-Postal-style fun. The character is cheesy in an endearingly 90's way. He wears a trench coat & Fedora for the sake of being what it is. His lines with his style do add an immense sense of humor to the whole thing, but the whole game is like that.Splatter gave me that feeling of a classic action movie. Goofy, over-the-top & overall completely worth a play and a New Game+. Yes, if you beat the game it does continue as a ""New Story"" with a New Game +.I don't need to say a lot of things about it for it do its job. That is the best part. Splatter is clean, old-fashioned zombie killing fun at a reasonable price that you can play as long as you want without really getting bored. I have no flaws to really pick at it other than I wish it was a bit longer, there were some typos here and there and the sound design can be a bit overbearing. I really wish a sequel would come out because actually it really reminded me of the Decision Series of Zombie Flash games all over the web. I want to see it really be a bigger & better game.Really enjoyed it; 8/10Length: Short (2 to 4 hours)			"

												You guys, this game is adorable.Splatter is a twin-stick zombie shooter in the vein of... hell, pick something. Your character embarks on an epic, rain-soaked journey from his living room to a mysterious government lab in search of the source of the mutant undead plague that has torn your city apart. On your quest you find a wide assortment of weapons, along with cash to upgrade them. The upgrade system is a particularly good one, allowing you multiple upgrades on a single weapon to turn it into an absurd all-in-one death-dealer. There's a surprising amount of content in each of the game's lengthy levels. Several have NPCs you can interact with, as well as optional sidequests for additional weapons and ammo. Some are centered around clever setpieces like a subway ride or a thresher driving sequence. Then there are additional secrets to find like armor upgrades and golden gun parts that I'm not clear on the purpose of, but by now it should be clear that there's plenty to do in the game's dozen or so open levels. Worth mentioning also that, aside from the gory action, there are some genuinely tense sections thanks to the lighting and encounter design in some of the darkened buildings and narrow corridors.What makes this game adorable is the presentation. Your ""hero"" is a fedora-wearing trenchcoat-clad iconoclast who can't help but be a condescending ♥♥♥♥ to everyone he meets. I can't overstate this... in the cutscene where you arrive at the shopping mall, he monologues about how the place once attracted a different mindless herd of consumers. You're essentially playing the EUPHORIC guy unironically and it makes the game like ten times funnier than it should be. I honestly can't tell if it's a giant parody or if you're supposed to be taking his gravelly fussing seriously, but either way it elevates the game from bargain-basement shooter to something special. Coupled with the solid gameplay, graphics, and level design, Splatter proved to be an unexpected gem.			"

												I love FPS games - I'm awful at them, but I still love them. What's not to love about shooting and blowing things up??With that said, I love this game! It's in black and white (except for the blood) resembling a 1930's or 1940's film. And you can shoot  and blow up just about everything. Fire a gun at a car and it blows up, hopefully taking a lot of zombies with it. Shoot boxes and you might find money (used to upgrade your weapons), shells, or other goodies.  As a matter of fact, you have to blow up everything you can to find hidden switches to get into hidden areas. There are secret areas that can be accessed if you can find the switch that lets you in.Both controller and keyboard are supported. I like using the mouse for aiming and shooting (I'm a complete spaz with the controller on shooting), so I have to live with the keyboard for movement (total spaz there, too!).An excellent feature (and a way to know that you're just about ready to die!) is the auto save.  The game will auto save just before a big battle where you could (and I generally did until I figured out the right strategy) die. That's the other thing I love about this game - there is strategy involved. If you use your resources wisely, you can get through even boss battles. If you like shooters, blowing things up, or zombies, you'll love this game. Recommended for beginers as well as more experienced players.			"

												It's a good budget title. Just note that the game works best when you disable v-sync. I had it on and was topping at 20FPS, turned it off and went up to a steady 60FPS throughout the entire game. Aside from that it was a good game. Plays like a top down twin stick shooter and feels like a resident evil game with the atmosphere, the monsters and even the cheesy dialogue. Although once the story mode is over, there is not much to go back on. There is survival mode where you take on hordes of zombies and monsters but it gets repetitive after a while.

												Extremely fun and addictive. Worth every cent.The story goes around your typical zombie infestation, starred by a cynical yet handy guy. Nothing special about him, except for the interesting interactions and ocasional collaborations with other AIs. The story is good and makes sense. Overall is a very good fast-paced game. Fast, fluid and fun to stress out for a while. Repeatable, specially the arcade modes, to get high scores.The easy mode is piece of cake, but funny if you want to cause maximum damage. The most difficult mode is exasperating and even passing the first final boss will take you out of your nerves.			"

												A very pleasant surprise in what on the surface looks like a run of the mill top-down shooter, ends up being a very solid and fun 10 hour experience. Gameplay is familiar to anyone who's played a top-down shooter, controls handle well and the guns feel as powerful as they should. Exploration is rewarded in the way of upgrades and cash which is always nice and the weapon upgrade system feels rewarding. Many upgrades are quite significant and go beyond the basic ""+damage"".The story is basic but still enough to keep you engaged, and the film-noir take on the zombie apocalypse is pretty interesting.Overall, well worth your time if you like this kind of game or if you're just looking for a change of pace from FPS/TPS shooters.

												I've heard this game compared to Hotline Miami, but to me it's much less twitchy and re-playing-based than that game. I would compare it to Max Payne in Left 4 Dead from a top down perspective. So it's fun and it's also got cool cut scenes and themeing.Everything you want in a twin stick shooter Difficult. It's not easy, especially when you don't have flares yet. To be honest I had to bump it down to easy mode and still died now and then. But it's better to be challenged than to be bored, in my book. Style. This game is very stylish and I love that. Humor. It's not wackyrandom or jokey but dark narration and tone really bring a grin to your face, especially when the protagonist gets worked up. Action. So much blood. Blood everywhere. So much shooting. So much destructible items. So much explosions. Multiplayer. Local co-op, or local versus.  Online leader boards for everything.  Arcade mode. Twin stick shooters are arcade games, really, so I always hope to see arcade mode. Controller support. I use a Steam controller and it works great. Although I did find the community profile to work better than the default, for aiming.Production values. Voice acted throughout, this doesn't look like a AAA game but it doesn't have the cut corners you see on many indie top down games.TLDR: it's a good one and a good price. Install it if you own it and give it a spin!			"

												I got this game for free, and I'm really glad I got a chance to try it out! It's a top down shooting game, kind of like Hotline Miami but without the stealth elements. It's really fast paced and exciting, and the story is voice acted and a lot more interesting than most zombie shooters. I really like that it has co-op available for up to 4 players and the online leader boards after each level are great too. It really makes the game work as a high score contest or as a story.			"

												An overall nice game with some flaws but worth your time if you enjoy this style of game (top down shooters) and/or zombie games! The gameplay and graphics are very fun and interesting, very rewarding challenge and several different modes to play (although I was mostly interested in the story mode, myself), with secrets and collectibles to find and a good (albiet sometimes silly) variety of enemies to fight. The boss fights were a weaker part of the gameplay for me, they didn't feel difficult because they posed any kind of challenge, it was more they were difficult because they take a lot of time to beat, and so were more of an endurance test (although I found the final stage and boss to be a lot more fun). The graphics, as stated, are good; although they seem a bit unoptimized as I have a fairly high-end computer that runs much more graphically-intensive games with no slowdown, yet this game slowed down for me a lot (though it was never unplayable) even on lower settings. (EDIT: Turns out I was just playing with the wrong graphics card, oops! So the performance issue is actually non-existent for me, so thats one less negative for the game!)The story and especially the dialogue itself really fell flat for me though, it felt very cheesy and try-hard, and the voice actors were clearly not professionals. The artwork in cutscenes was so-so as well, although I give the game a bit of a pass in this regard as the game was fun enough to play regardless, although I admit I'd have liked it even better with some more polish in those areas! The storymode is also fairly short (around 5 hours or so) but it felt like enough to me, I enjoyed playing it for about an hour a day over the course of a week. Plus, there are other modes to try out after that!All in all I recommend this game to those who enjoy top down shooters with a bit of exploration, zombies, and going for high scores! Worth the time you'll get out of it for the price.			"

												Well the game is not an exceptional intellectual challenge but me thinks it's not intended to be. Just to hop in for a few minutes and blow everything up and kill hordes of zombies  is a lot of fun.If you consider the free game you get if you give them your email and the trading cards you get the game for next to nothing. The game has no major flaws it's average with well made visuals and compares very favourably with the dreck you see in this price range.I think I even discovered a new game mode which you can combine with others. Play it in 4K so everything gets really tiny and you have to aim very accurately. Now you have a new challenge to beat.Considering the guilty pleasure I have I give the game a 6/10 because it's nothing special but still a no brainer to buy.			"

												Seems like a fantastic game, but still plagued with problems.. Took 15 min to change the controller to Keyboard & mouse because it seemed to pickup my joystick as a priority in the game and assigning the move & aim axis to my throttle.. and it kept reverting to ""controller"" when i swapped it.. After unplugging the joystick, it kept crashing every 5 or so minutes, or the menu wouldnt go away but the game played on in the background.. or lastly, my guy just ran in random directions like a stuck key... hopefully it keeps getting updated.. it would REALLY be nice to see online Co-op..

												At first glance, the game looks like a bland shooter, a carbon copy of other zombie games on steam. Don't be fooled by the game's trailer and screenshots because the game is much better than what is marketed.Splatter is a top-down shooter that has a (cheesy) plot, great pacing, amazing sound design and aesthetics. Various infected types, side missions, weapons and mechanics will be introduced as the story progresses, keeping the game fresh. There're three game modes to choose from: Arcade (with various difficulties), Local co-op and Survivor. Grab this if you like twin-stick shooters and brainless (zombie pun :D) carnage.			"

												This is a very interesting top down shooter in the veins of old school GTAs and Hotline Miami. It's a simple story, you play a guy who lives in an area overrun by monsters and you have to shoot your way out of it. The addition of control pad support is very helpful. It's a easy game to pick up and play and just have some mindless fun.The graphics are strong for the style of game with lighting and a color fade to B/W when you're hurt standing out as cool effects. All in all, this is a fun game that is worth giving a go to espc if you enjoy old school top down shooters.			"

												Overview of Gameplay:A shooting game that feels like Hotline Miami and the top-down GTA's had a love child, Splatter makes for a nice simple shooting game that rewards ingenuity with a scoring system but may be completed with plain attrition for those who like to take things slow(er).  I've only played on Normal at the time of writing this, mind you. The two difficulties above normal might contradict the slow-but-steady success.For those unfamiliar with the two games I mentioned, you control the character with four-directional keys (defaults to WASD/Arrows) from a top-down view and use the mouse to rotate-and-aim your guns.  The aiming reticule is essentially a stylised mouse pointer, bullets may hit obstacles in the way of where you're aiming though, or fly past it, so bear that in mind.Without giving too much away, foes come in several shapes and sizes to force prioritising of who to deal with and how to deal with them (do I stand in the corner and hope the big guy dies before he gets to me?).  Some even require a hard counter to defeat, such as one that may only be killed by explosive barrels or deterred with flares.Pros:I quite like the music for the game, it doesn't feel jarring in comparison to what's happening in-game for the sake of including music.  The main menu music is pretty nice as well, it's not so repetitive that you want to sort out your settings as fast as possible lest you hear a five second loop some more times.On the topic of sound, I like the fact that internal and external sounds are affected by walls and the like; when I started the game I noticed that the rain would get louder the closer to the window(s) I moved.  It's a subtle touch, but it makes the game that bit more enjoyable.The game doesn't suffer from giving you weapons that strictly only hurt enemies either, who's heard of a grenade launcher that only damages people?  Tables, sinks, doors... they may all be destroyed by your arsenal, or left to get in the way of your foes!  Forcing enemies that can't destroy tables into choke points has made my life a lot easier on many occasions, and also given me a nice score bonus for multi-kills to boot.Destructible objects also give way to the other feature I appreciate in a game, adding exploration value.  Splatter contains several secrets in most of the levels that give the player perhaps early access to some weapons, money (to upgrade things), health kits (no nasty, cheap health regen! :D) and more!Missions with escort/protection elements to them weren't overly annoying either, I never felt like I had to make myself a meat shield to keep someone alive, or pull a Wanted and shoot around them to kill foes.Another subtle touch I appreciated was the slow motion resuming a paused game resulted in.  If I'm in the middle of a mission and have to AFK in a hurry I do not want the ESC key on my return to lead to my immediate demise because I couldn't remember where the multitude of enemies were with perfect clarity.Cons:My biggest qualm with the game has to be how immediately a mission can end.  I like to explore levels as I progress through them and perhaps double-check I didn't miss anything before finishing it, however on my first playthrough of a mission I never really knew where 'the end' was; I would finish an objective to then find the screen is fading away to give me a mission score screen!  I don't like playing a mission twice just to collect some money I missed.I mentioned earlier the enemies are varying, and of course there's your typical slow, big, and tough enemy.  The problem is their pathing AI is the same as the smaller enemy that attacks in a similar manner... this leads to a bulky enemy trying to fit through a door that is way too small for it!I also noticed that the larger enemies consist of several sprites stacked on top of one another to give them more animations.  They don't fall out of sync (no scary floating torsos, yay) but the legs do look odd when the enemy is shot at.  I often used a pistol to whittle them down from a distance and a shotgun once they came too close for my liking; however the fast pistol shots led to the legs turning static while the torso played an impact animation.  Pistols don't really slow enemies by much so the big guy would continue moving towards me with static legs... unless they're on roller-skates?Splatter also suffers from way-too-excited-NPC syndrome, practically everyone I spoke to would be way too happy to say everything as if I was across the room and in need of severe motivation to do anything (granted, the protagonist does have a gruff demeanour).  When gathering the objective from strangers, ignoring the way it's presented made things more enjoyable than listening intently.Speaking of listening intently, each mission would give a transition cutscene to give a sense of story progression... except each mission is around 10-15 minutes (or less if you like to speed run) but the conclusions the protagonist comes to are as if he's been reflecting on matters for days!  For example, after helping a settlement (not in that way, Preston) for a couple of missions my character gave the impression of it being the last bastion of humanity that he had grown attached to.  I don't know about you, but I don't miss somewhere if I've only been there for half an hour.Pausing the game unfortunately does not quieten the in-game ambient sound, hitting ESC on a rainy level meant I didn't have the sounds of enemies and the like, but I instead had to put up with loud rain on its own!The slow motion on resume also led to an interesting bug.  There are upgrade stations that bring up an overlay when approached for you to decide on what to upgrade... however my character would still fire when I click on the menu as if the overlay wasn't there.  I couldn't see the shots, or what I hit, but I could hear what was going on.  Make sure the slow-motion ends before interacting with stations!Last of all, a couple of achievements could do with being made secret.  I won't say too much on the matter other than reading their descriptions led to me being prepared for a few sudden events.  If you want to at least be surprised, don't read the achievements on your first playthrough!Conclusions:If you want a top-down shooting game and don't care much for plot then I definitely recommend giving this game a go; it's not flawless in execution, but I enjoyed playing it.If RPG-esque immersion is something you want, or a deep plot, then steer well away!Rating:6/10Reviewed by Ahkrin 'Descol, community member of Validus.

												This is probably the best indie title of the genre for years to come. Splatter is an incredible dense and atmospheric top-down zombie shooter with a unique Max Payne noir style. Everything in this game has so much artistic detail put into it. The latest version is fully voiced, the voice acting is decent and supports the atmosphere.Animation, lighting and effects (especially the splatter) are great, the noir-storytelling is awesome and the gameplay offers despite its linearity a lot of variety that keeps you motivated. Besides ammo and health you collect money to invest in upgrades for different weapons (genre typical pistol, shotgun, AR, flamer,  RPG, ...).Be warned though, the medium difficulty already gives you a taste of survival in a zombie apocalypse:You run blindly into the streets, you'll die.You rush into a room without checking your six, you'll die.You let yourself get surrounded or cornered, you'll die.You rush into a corridor without thinking of a emergency exit, ... guess what... you'll die.There are a few things you have to set up in the options though:First, turn down music and effect volume and turn up the voice volume.Second, set the control style to 'cardinal direction' or you'll be moving like Jill in the first Resident Evil game.I prefer to play with the xbox controller, but mouse controls work great as well.

												With an assortment of top-down shooters to choose from, Splatter is a gem.With the exception of one level segment and (to my knowledge) a bug only I've encountered thus far regarding the final boss, there aren't many flaws to be found in the game beyond those that are minor (occasional spelling errors in the dialogue and item texts being the only thing that stands out readily and even then they aren't hindering enjoyment of the game overall).Dreamworlds has managed to nail exactly what makes this particular type of game fun to play vs. turning it into an interminably difficult chore. The dialogue and art-based cutscenes don't drag on longer than they need to, leaving plenty of time to enjoy soaking multiple parts of a level's floor with the blood of enemies.The game's story is one that, whether intentional or not, is reminiscent of the best ""worst"" B-movies of all time (with voice acting to match). Going in expecting the plot to make sense is not recommended, to say the least. It's not confusing but it certainly doesn't have a strong foothold on logic either (which is a good thing, since a game like this would only be hurt by taking itself too seriously).Gameplay is rather typical for the type - you run and gun down hordes of monstrosities, with the occasional boss or arena-styled fight thrown in for variation. A difference in the formula comes in the ability to toss a flare to the ground which will act as a temporary repellent for a majority of the creatures that want to tear you to pieces. There are also a small number of collectible items to be had for those looking to explore the levels, mostly extra cash to be used to upgrade existing weapons in your arsenal (which is generous but not particularly extensive beyond essentials like a pistol, shotgun and flamethrower to name a few) but there are others such as pieces of a flak jacket and a weapon upgrade that negates putting all your money into upgrading the starting pistol.The environments, each containing destructible elements, are varied enough that you aren't left looking at a parade of the same color all the time (though eventually you'll be looking at red and green frequently once the bodies begin to drop) and the lighting in the game affords it some nice tricks in terms of enemies that remain stationary until the player comes into their line of sight.Splatter also has a medium element of replay built into it. Beyond the collectibles, there are branching story points that can be taken on subsequent plays. While they aren't as in-depth as those featured in more story-focused games, they do serve as a nice and simple way of extending the time one spends with the game. Dreamworlds has also included a survival mode, complete with leaderboards, which should satisfy anyone looking for an arcade-style experience.Overall, I can't recommend this game enough, especially if you're the type who has enjoyed any top-down shooter made within the last decade or so. It certainly isn't the kind of game everyone can enjoy but if you're willing to give it a chance, it just might surprise you (as it did me).			"

												This is probably the best indie title of the genre for years to come. Splatter is an incredible dense and atmospheric top-down zombie shooter with a unique Max Payne noir style. Everything in this game has so much artistic detail put into it. The latest version is fully voiced, the voice acting is decent and supports the atmosphere.Animation, lighting and effects (especially the splatter) are great, the noir-storytelling is awesome and the gameplay offers despite its linearity a lot of variety that keeps you motivated. Besides ammo and health you collect money to invest in upgrades for different weapons (genre typical pistol, shotgun, AR, flamer,  RPG, ...).Be warned though, the medium difficulty already gives you a taste of survival in a zombie apocalypse:You run blindly into the streets, you'll die.You rush into a room without checking your six, you'll die.You let yourself get surrounded or cornered, you'll die.You rush into a corridor without thinking of a emergency exit, ... guess what... you'll die.There are a few things you have to set up in the options though:First, turn down music and effect volume and turn up the voice volume.Second, set the control style to 'cardinal direction' or you'll be moving like Jill in the first Resident Evil game.I prefer to play with the xbox controller, but mouse controls work great as well.

												Trash-filled, simplistic top-down zombie shooter. Kinda similar to Shadowgrounds, with the storytelling reminiscent of Max Payne.Graphics glitched out on highest gfx settings, but setting shadows to 2nd best option fixed it.Got the game for 0,49€ and it's worth every single cent, probably one of the best bangs for bucks I got on Steam so far.Definitely recommended.

												No, the STORY IS NOT CO-OP.It has 4 player local co-op horde mode and a deathmatch mode though.I had the game lying in my library for a long time. I installed it today and the result was...SURPRISING.This game was nearly as fun to me as Dead Nation on PS3( at least 80% as fun, and that is a very good thing ). The gameplay is amazingly good. Don't be fooled by the price point(like I was). This game has a full-fledged single-player campaign and is very well-optimized.Also, the game looks much better than the screenshots posted on steam. Much more immersive.GET THIS and more importantly.... PLAY THIS.How much is this worth for? well I can bet you won't regret spending 5$ for this game.			"

												I'm fairly new to the realm of PC Gaming as of this Review.  And this was the first game I purchased on my Steam account.Not certain as to what I was getting into when buying this game.But seeing as it was on 49 cents when I purchased it on saleI figured I would give it a chance seeing that I enjoy zombie games.This game has taken me by surpise at how good it is.The graphics are of a good quality.The sound and voice acting is decent as well.And the controls are spot on (at least with an Xbox One controller).I would seriously recommend this game for anyone who likes twin stick shooters.Or anyone who simply enjoys killing zombies.Not to mention the little touches it has in the game thus far :-)I hope my thought's have helped in some small way.I am certain that not everyone will agree with my above statementsAnd that is alright.To each their own :-)			"

												I bought this game because the Something Awful reviewer said it was absolutely precious. They're right. The main character in this game is a generic noir detective in a zombie apocalypse but for one thing: he's an absolute tool to everybody around him at all times. Like, he's aggressively the worst, and lets you know it through a bunch of voice acted monologues.The game is a generic twin-stick shooter. It's not great, it's kinda silly. It's good for killing some time. If you liked Alien Shooter or Alien Shooter 2 or any of those other games, you should BUY IT for like a dollar on sale.			"

												Splatter - Zombie Apocalypse is a very simple top down shooter, nothing more nothing less. The control is not clunky, BGM is okay-ish,problem free no crash issue or whatsoever. Splatter is an excellent average joe game that sold for heavilly discounted at 90%. You just go in rampage mode, destroy every furniture you saw, shoot all the zed, collect goodies and upgrade your weapon. For a 90% discounted game, this is unbeatable deal of the year.You get yourself a few hours of fun,steam cards, 3 games mode: Story,arcade,multiplayer and despite all the cheesy storyline and so-so voice acting; Splatter is pretty entertaining and fun to play. Definitely is a deal to catch for the value and fun. You paid more and spend shorter time in cinema for a movie than this. What could be better?! Popcorn anyone??			"

OVERVIEWSplatter - Blood Red Edition is a film-noir-influenced top-down zombie shooter with a crazy sense of humour.You play Max, a hard-bitten guy interrupted in his house one night by his ringing doorbell. He answers the door, only to see a crazed zombie being gunned down by a soldier in the hallway. At the soldier's insistence, Max leaves the house and follows the soldier out onto the street, where he sees chaos has taken over the city. Picking up a pistol from a nearby dead body, Max proceeds to shoot his way through hordes of zombies in his escape from the city and onwards.GraphicsSplatter has great graphics. Everything is played from an overhead view and characters and enemies look quite small, but everything is nicely detailed and reasonably animated. The graphics remind me of a cross between early Grand Theft Autos (GTA 1 or 2) and the fantastic 90s adventure game from Empire, Dream Web.Interspersed between the game levels are atmospheric graphic-novel-style cut scenes with completely over-the-top voice acting reading a typical film noir script. It's like an indie version of the first Max Payne, and it's alternately appalling and hilarious, or sometimes both at once.Graphics options are fairly numerous and on my aging gaming laptop (first-gen i7 with 485m graphics) the game mostly runs well at full HD with everything at Max (except for shadows, which are 'nice' -- the highest setting caused weird flashing on my laptop), with only an occasional pause or slowdown in sections. In typical film noir style, it's almost always dark and raining, and it looks good.SoundSound is mostly pretty good, although the standard pistol sounds decidedly unimpressive. There are appropriate groans and growls from the zombies and other creatures, and suitably squishy sounds when you shoot them.The game has full voice acting that is very appropriate to the style. Some of it is awful and some of it is good, but it's all over the top and is mostly great fun. I laughed out loud in a few places at the absurdity of the script and the actors hamming it up. Assuming that it's what they were going for, it's very well done.GameplaySplatter plays like most other top-down shooters: WASD moves your character, while mouse aims his weapon around him, and LMB fires your chosen weapon. RMB is used for tossing magnesium flares, which scare the zombies away, allowing you to break their charges and more easily pick them off. Weapons are easily changed to once collected just by scrolling the mouse wheel.Enemies are very numerous and range from normal zombies, to overgrown super-zombies, weird crawly maggot things, annoying leaping creatures that like the shadows, and various other evil flesh eaters. A nice addition over other zombie shooters is that the zombie hordes charge at you when they notice you, reminding me of the infected from 28 Days Later; these are no shambling corpses!The environment is mostly destructible, allowing you to use cars and other explodey things as booby traps for the unsuspecting hordes. Your pistol must be super powered, though, as one shot is usually enough to detonate even the strongest-looking vehicle parked on the side of the road.The game keeps you playing with upgrades, which you can purchase at set points through the story by using cash collected from killing zombies. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it works well at keeping the player interested, even if it does feel a little grindy. Weapon upgrades are definitely worthwhile, though, with the top-of-the-line pistol upgrade giving you bursts of magnesium-infused bullets that have a chance of causing your targets to flee for a short time.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Great graphics+ Silly script and humorously overdone voice acting+ Good range of weapons and upgrades+ Trading cards+ Achievements, most of which are actually pretty satisfying to get+ Great sense of humour (""It must be Art"" Wtf!? This one made me laugh!)+ Shooting up the scenery is fun, if a little unrealistic at timesCons:- Some grammar errors in the writing- Some mispronunciations and not-so-great voice acting as well- Some of the enemies really annoy me (but I suspect they're meant to, so it's not really a con)CONCLUSIONSplatter - Blood Red Edition is a fun top-down zombie-and-weird-creature shooter with film-noir influences. It has a great sense of humour and doesn't take itself too seriously. Recommended for good fun and (mostly) mindless violence. 7/10 "

			The protaganist seems somewhat familiar. Still a budget twin stick zombie shooter thats dressed to kill? Count me in!		

A decent length campaign and a survival mode ensure replay value, and the controls are tight and precise. However the visuals are quite impressive for the budget price - this is an indie game done right. Also should add that the rocking sound track for boss fights is catchy as hell. The only gripe I guess is the sometimes odd difficulty spikes, but then a game should be challenging so its not a dealbreaker by any means.			"

												I've tried a few times to play this game and I really want to, but it just doesn't seem to want me to. Controller input is all screwed up (I've tried it with a Logitech RumblePad 2 with Pinnacle Profiler, and an Xbox 360 controller as well), nothing works.The menu screens also jitter every time a new selection is made, and then will jump back to another position.Fix the game, and I'll fix my review, otherwise, this is an extremely disappointing gaming experience.

												HOLD ONI know what you're thinkingthis looks like some throwaway steam title right?Like something you'd play for 30 minutes then forget you ever bought it?Wrong.This game is honestly one of the most well done top-down shooters I've ever played, especially in the last few years. It has hints of SAS Zombies and a bit of Zombie Shooter, but the story! Oh god where to begin.The game is brutally difficult, even on the normal setting. You'll be rewarded for exploration and secret-hunting, like if you get the 8 golden gun parts you won't need to spend money on upgrades.Each gun has 4 upgrades, which cost 300, 500, 750, and 1000 each. Looking for money is very useful.The zombies and various creatures are afraid of flares, and some weapons can be upgraded to use tracer rounds and magnesium bullets to startle them.The boss fights are incredible, i'e played at least 3 hours so far and I'm not even near to finishing all the upgrades and modes, but I think the campaign is 5 hours long but there's tons of bonus modes i haven't even gotten intoThe game is very gory and actually quite good looking. it reminds me of the graphics from the upcoming title, The Hong Kong Massacre, and at max settings it works flawlessly and looks fantastic.Along the way you'll be forced to make moral choices, most of these are just side missions but they are always quite rewarding and sometimes they are the only way to get all the upgrade parts and secrets.The game is worth the 9 bucks you spend and honestly I've enjoyed this game about as much as Hotline Miami and even more than alien/zombie shooter thanks to the in-depth story, great voice acting and cutscenes and the white-hot shooting.The only downside to this game is the amount of time you will waste playing it, and the difficulty. The game, I'm assuming, can be played multiple times and there's even a hotseat 4-person coop, and survival modes. The combat is fierce and you will die in 4 hits from zombies most of the time.Honestly? I'm very, very glad I got this game. I play mostly fps games and this was exactly the something different I was looking for. If you're into shooting games and want something as intense as Killing Floor with the story of, say, Max Payne, then you'll probably love this game.			"

												Fun so far, still need to finish it.  Pretty traditional top-down shooter.  Seems like it's going for some sort of Max Payne type thing with the black and white storyboards and the noir-ish protagonist.  Not a particularly good looking game, the enemies are fairly bland looking and environmental stuff like explosive barrels look weird.  That said, the gameplay itself is pretty fun.  So far it's standard top-down shooter fare with zombies and some special zombies sprinkled in.  Beat the first boss, which was alright, fairly easy.  Kind of a bullet-sponge, though, which was lame.  I'd prefer something more challenging and less spongy.  There's also a currency system which you can find throughout the levels (and maybe from killing enemies too?  I don't remember), which you can then spend to upgrade your weapons.  The upgrades I've gotten so far seem pretty meaty, not just minor incremental upgrades, you definitely notice the extra punch (plus the laser sight in the case of the handgun).  Also, blowing up barrels or other explosives is very satisfying.  There's a lot of destruction in counters and cars and boxes and whatnot and seeing all of that blow up along with the zombies is pretty fun.  Anyway, I'd recommend picking it up for under $1 if a top-down zombie shooter sounds interesting to you.			"

												I played it, i tried to like it, but i couldn't manage to handle the problems and bugs i encountered during my play.First, as a personal note, i didn't liked the story:  a cynical character, always wearing a fedora and a black jacket, scornful towards humans and spiders, but at the same time trying to help the survivors of the first race to survive against the zombie pandemic. But we won't know from our protagonist why he is doing so; as for this, many cutscenes may leave us without important pieces of history, expecially when the story progresses after the introduction of our ""hero"". And also, what do we have as the final boss, the villain that is the cause of the pandemic in this story? Cthulu... I'm sick to death of these myths already, thank you plot.  Nothing new or different that you can find from a tale for babies.The second biggest and worse problem involves it's gameplay, where you already find out how the game becomes bugged at some point:  the harvester ""boss"" was it's first sign, where  i struggled to let the fight progress, as to defeat this boss it's needed to move him first, but most of the times it just standed in it's place, or instead of charging me, it flinched. Yes, instead of charging to me, it just moved away from me. The Worm boss was another fight of this kind, where  it stucked at some place while it was moving around the place of the fight, covering it's only weakspot.The last problem, but not the least, that annoyed me alot and accompanied me most of the time of the gameplay, was the low health screen warning; as i were pretty experienced in top-down-shooter games, i tried to start the game at the biggest level of difficulty available, and still now i regret that choice, not for the difficulty itself, that wasn't anyway that hard, but for the change of the screen's colors to a very bright white and a low black when your health reaches around the 30%.It was a damn pain in the eyes, curable with the few medikits scarred around the levels, which weren't easy to find in these bad colors in a top-down visual. They could've at least allow an option to disable this ""feature"", but they didn't.My experience were painful and tedious, and so is my opinion of this game: Bad and Tedious.			"

												Nothing really horrible about it, but it's just another top down 360 shooter that doesn't really do anything spectacular.  My play time might show more than 30 minutes but that was only to earn the trading cards.  I lost interest in it pretty quickly.  It's not the worst game I've ever gotten as part of a bundle, but it certainly is not worth ten dollars and the current 89% positive reviews on Steam makes this game look like it might be something special and it just couldn't keep my attention for long.  Oh and the targeting reticle is way too small to see.   If I had a constructive criticism that would be it.  Make the reticle adjustable in size and transparency.			"

												Great game I am already in around 1hr and 40 mins around there as of time writing this, sound is good but the effects are louder then the voice. But you can turn that down, two major problems. The low light and the controls, there should be better brightness to notice the enemies. And the controls needs a little working, but with controller it is better. But still keyboard and mouse you manage, but I only played normal. In hard you might need controller, overal great game. Get it, it is a great game, get it.P.S Also you can talk to people by going to them, they automatically start talking. But lets say there is 3 people together, you can only talk to the person that will give a mission. And if you go up to the people or person they talk again, they say the same thing. Edit: And if it had randomized missions it would be better, but overal its good.			"

												Game starts and runs well on Linux, though it does not handle keyboard input, as in keyboard does not work at all, with my setup (Logitech unifying wireless keyboard).

												Almost like Postal, except I guess this is more justified since you are killing zombies? To me it seems like the same concept, kill everything, destroy everything, so I do not understand why this is not rated for more mature audiences, but I guess killing zombies is different from killing people running around. This is a top down shooter, there is a story, but it is just there, and at times, almost weak and stereotypical.			"

												Sadly, I cannot recommend this game. I'm sure its fun to actually play, but I never was able to get there. Like SO MANY mac users, we bought the game and were unable to play the game. The Dev did seem concerned about the inability for some of his players to run the game, and bought a Mac to test it, but after he didn't receive the crash himself, I heard nothing of imminent patches.I'll likely purchase the game again if I see that it gets fixed, but right now, if you have a Mac, DO NOT BUY.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Splatter Blood Red Edition 

			Views: 611		

			Splatter Blood Red Edition is a top down shooter with some story. Available on Steam here http://store.steampowered.com/app/281920/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing here:...		

Splatter Blood Red Edition is a top down shooter with some story, and the main question, is it worth your time? Sadly I have to say no, for the reasons that while the game does have a strong atmosphere, the story however has many gaps in it. The voice acting and art style of the  cutscense is very well done, but they leave way to many unanswered questions. The music is good and fast pace but one of attack attack, not suspense or fear of being attacked. That aside, how the weapons handle, the animation and very small number of weapons you have are nothing special.  The combat becomes very repetitive after the first mission, and the enemy animation and art style do not invoke any fear or suspense to the game. For more reviews be sure to check out the channel here, and thank you for your viewership.   http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

DOES NOT WORK ON MAC.And what does the developer have to say about that?""Hm. Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately I don't have a Mac anymore, so I can't fix that bug. This will probably change in the future, but I guess you don't want to hold your breath until then. So please use the Steam Refund function, and please accept my apologies.""That's from October. It's January now. The game is still on the store for Mac and Linux. You can open the menu, but you can't click on any options. When asked to take the Mac version down from the store (since it is unplayable), the developer has this to say:""I understand your gripes, but I'm pretty sure I'm already delivering a way better support than most large studios and publishers do. So please let's not make a mountain out of a molehill. Most OSX users can play the game just fine, and for those who can't I'll come up with a solution, but just not now. So for the moment I suggest using the refund function, and maybe leave an angry review. But stopping sale alltogether seems like overkill to me.""No, gnarf. You are not delivering ""way better support"". You're not providing *any* support. So here's your angry review, and now it's time to refund the game. We aren't ""making a mountain out of a molehill"". You are selling an unplayable game. That's kind of a big deal. Sucks too, cause this game looks like a lot of fun. And yes, I know I could just dual-boot, play in Windows. But you promised that it worked on Mac and Linux. It does not. It's the principle of the thing.			"

												Utter garbage but reminded me of good old UTK (Ultimate Tapan Kaikki) which is an old finnish freeware game and has thousand times more attitude than this hipster zombie crap. Gameplay: -Run backwards and shoot zombies (weapons feel like throwing cottonballs)-Intense flashlight-based exploration (♥♥♥♥♥ dark) -Shoot boxes to destroy boxes (best thing right after shooting zombies) -Fight against dead (and naked!) dudes who run towards you with their hands raised up!! Damn! Graphics: -Revolutionary top down, third person view-Dark-Some lightsStory:-Suddenly a random hipster runs before youa)shoot himb)allow him to take a weaponColors:-Not Blood Red enoughPros. -This is definitely a game, interactive, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story-Start Splatter to collect awesome cards! (then uninstal)Cons. -Not good enough to be better than average -Voice acting from german adult films -Needs and option to commit suicide-Easy on hardest setting (wtf, made for noobs?) "

												After 5 minutes I had to refund the game.There was already more than a few things that really bothered me.To start with, the lighting gave me a headache. Not because the strobe effects... no, it was because the game mixes static lighting with real-time lighting in a REALY weird way. The real time lighting is nice until the static light cuts it off in really weird angles. I'm not talking about walls, although the lighting on walls is pretty messed up too.The guns don't reload. I like my guns to reload, the guns in the game feel cheap.... some vibration  in the gamepad would have been nice too since the game was designed for use with a controller.Some other things just feel off as well.I only paid $0.99 and I felt the need to refund because there are just too many design choices that throw my groove off. I know if I kept it I wouldn't play it so I put in a request for refund.			"

												Fairly entertaining bit of over-the-top zombie splattering fun. Reminds me a little of playing Into the Eagle's Nest waaaay back (but with fewer Nazi soldiers, obviously). It does contain a number of cheesy Max Payne-esque interludes where it tries to get a little noir and promptly disappears up its own backside but other than that, you'll be mostly dishing out lead first come, first served. The main campaign is a little short, mind, even if you're trying to explore every corner of the map.			"

												I stand behind my original review one hundred percent and would hold it up as a particularly fine example of modern critical analysis. With that said, I suppose this game's pretty fun if you like shooting things. It's repetitive and when it does try to switch things up it relies on instant hordes spawn and leaving you clueless as to what you're supposed to be doing. But all in all, fun enough if you like this sort of thing, especially for the price. I recommend it. ORIGINAL REVIEW:I like the way that you get stuck on scenery in the busy backgrounds, and I especially like the way the screen tints when you've taken some damage so you can't possibly tell what's going on. Two thumbs up out of five. Die, die, die. In case you can't tell, I truly hate you.			"

												Splatter has a very simple gameplay and a setting we saw so many times, it will not surprise you in any way, it is pretty enjoyable though.Two minor details I found interesting:Con - The hard boiled protagonist doesn't feel to be in the right placePro - After resuming the game from pause you get back to action slowly with a progressivly increasing slow motion. A simple and yet genial feature I would like to see in all the fast action games.			"

												Nice indie game made with a lot of love for the old topdown shooter genre. The story is gloriously dumb but it's made entertaining due to its Max Payne noir sensibilties. I encountered a few glitches but nothing game breaking - overall it was very polished.There is a progression system in the form of an extensive range of upgrades for your weapons; by the end of the game you'll have collected 7 weapons in total and there are four upgrades per weapon, each of which affects said weapon in a different way. Money is limited so you won't be able to upgrade everything, which creates some replay value. It should take you around 6 to 7 hours to beat on the hardest difficulty.Would reccommend for some mindless fun.			"

												I think it's safe for me to say that it IS a toned down version of hatred, It's not exactly what I expected challenge wise, but after a couple of stages, the difficulty has risen and the challenging levels have grown to be actually time based attacks, and planning towards not being stuck in a corner. I would grab it if it is on sale, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pay 9.95 for it. 6/10			"

												Great graphics, and the  controls feel really tight. I hate playing top down shooters with a mouse+keys, the Xbox controller is a MAJOR improvement from many other top down shooters.The graphics on the store page makes this game look like a 2D hand drawn game. The game is either using a 3D engine, or the graphics are pre-rendered and they are using a lighting shader trick. (normal or bumpmaps). The walking animation of the player is a little lame, but I am a professional animator. For an indie game the animations are definatly up to par.The greatest part of this game is the price. On this sale I got it for $1.00 and I can definatly justify the paying price.Have only played some of the first level, but I can already tell I will be returning to play this game after I win Fallout 4 again.

												This is by far the best ""2.5 D"" style shooter I have ever played and there are several reasons behind that:-the graphics are great.-the game encourages you to explore its world, usually rewarding you with secrets, weapon parts and other goodies.-the game has a really neat system that allows you to upgrade your weapons which I really love, allowing you to get an instant dose of satisfaction when you see the changes.-the game is action-packed and tries to make you come up with a strategy in dealing with the zombies. You have to think what horde of zombies you have to shoot first, about where should you position yourself while shooting zombies, when to throw flares, what weapon should you use, etc.-it has a pretty good story and features some really good voice actors.-it's quite cheap, comparing to similar titles, but that doesn't mean it's bad; on the contrary: it's a cool game with lots of interesting stuff for you to explore.Overall, the game's awesome and I definately recommend purchasing it. I'd rate it 9.5/10.			"

												While it's not my normal cuppa tea. This game gets excellent performance and the atmosphere is wonderful. If I am ever in the mood for a frantic Hotline Miami-styled Zombie shooter I'll launch this one! My laptop is not the best system so I knocked it down to 720p to get a better framerate and the map scales beautifully.Given to me by Epic Quest games.			"

												5 - Great 4 - Good 3 - Regular2 - Bad1 - TerribleSplatter - Blood Red Edition is a fun top-down-shooter with noir-like elements. If you're a fan of the genre, I'd say definately pick it up full price!The plot is linear, but it draws your attention enough so you want to keep playing to see what's up next. Although the plot is linear, the gameplay is not: sometimes you can make choices, even though they are minimal, and also can take on sidequests for some extra cash or ammo/loot -- there are not a lot of sidequests, but they are there to be completed.Enemy variety is not abundant, however, I think I like it that way; I mean, c'mon, it has zombies and its mutations and also some animal-ish mutations for good matter, what more can you want for a zombie shooter?Arcade survival mode is self-explanatory, always fun for some casual mindless shooting.I can say the game is polished enough, but there was one problem that made things difficult for me and even got me killed once. It started happening on the later stages: lightning effects issues. At first, it was just some crazy lightning effects -- like near a flame; but then it got to the point where I'd be in a dark room and my flashlight wouldn't work whatsoever! It's hard to explain, but the problem basically is: sometimes the game won't activate your flashlight because it thinks you're on a bright area, but you're not. You can see that's a glitch because, for the most part, the lightning effects are pretty satisfying for your eyes, but for the later stages, you might often see your character on a dark place without his flashlight on and some weird lightning effect dancing on your screen. Although that can get you killed, it's not a game-breaking issue by any means.That glitch aside, game's awesome. Acquiring and upgrading weapons is satisfying; shooting zombies is relaxing and fun. It's a good casual fun for fans of shooters and zombies.			"

												I really enjoyed this top down shooter.  The mechanics for all of the weapons work well, the maps are fun to explore and offer the occasional puzzle to solve, and the boss fights and hordes of zombies are fun.  The handgun can get pretty overpowered when fully upgraded, so I find myself using the other weapons a bit less.  Maybe if the weapons were balanced a little different?			"

												A few hours of fun in the story mode. The story is pretty dumb, but in a fun way, keeps the satisfying action nicely together.The simple controls work great, graphics are lovely and gory, music fits the game. Voice acting is a bit... all over the place, but it's still kind of charming, and the main character is voiced fittingly. Reminds me of Max Payne, as does some other aspects of the game's atmosphere.Solid indie title for its price, 8/10 if you enjoy the genre.			"

												Great graphics, and the  controls feel really tight. I hate playing top down shooters with a mouse+keys, the Xbox controller is a MAJOR improvement from many other top down shooters.The graphics on the store page makes this game look like a 2D hand drawn game. The game is either using a 3D engine, or the graphics are pre-rendered and they are using a lighting shader trick. (normal or bumpmaps). The walking animation of the player is a little lame, but I am a professional animator. For an indie game the animations are definatly up to par.The greatest part of this game is the price. On this sale I got it for $1.00 and I can definatly justify the paying price.Have only played some of the first level, but I can already tell I will be returning to play this game after I win Fallout 4 again.

												Recommendedtl;dr Game's fine. Decent graphics. Good amount of variety. Mostly fun shooting. Crappy story.Pros: Decent enemy variety: each enemy has an attack pattern (my favourite ones are the toadmen) You can mow down zombies with a threshing machine. Combat is fairly nuanced with different weapons fitting different situations. Advanced weapons have meaningful upgrades and feel satisfying to use. Gallons of blood and  hordes of enemies. The campaign manages to stay fresh thanks to sidemissions, a decent amount of exploration, various environments. It also introduces newer game mechanics (like fireflies) the more you progress into the game. When he's not trying to sound grim and somber and instead just acts all snarky, the main character is actually quite likable/funny. Graphically the game looks good enough with nice lighting effects, even though character models aren't great.Cons: Voice acting and story are utter trash. They are on the same level of the Alien Shooter series. You really don't care  about the other NPCs and are likely to skip their dialogues. Ammo is rare enough that you will be forced to use your basic pistol a lot. The pistol has infinite ammo and is somewhat efficient at killing most enemies. The problem is that it's just not that fun to shoot with. When your HP is low enough your view gets grayed out, until you find some (rare) health-pack. This is obnoxious because you can't see jackshit in this mode. The basic ubiquitous enemy zombies sport crappy uninspired models, bad animations and are generally unsatisfying to kill. Bosses are infamous bullet-sponges. They really take a million years to die, not fun at all. "

												I think it's safe for me to say that it IS a toned down version of hatred, It's not exactly what I expected challenge wise, but after a couple of stages, the difficulty has risen and the challenging levels have grown to be actually time based attacks, and planning towards not being stuck in a corner. I would grab it if it is on sale, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pay 9.95 for it. 6/10			"

												A top-view shooter which relies on the simple arcade gameplay which has been around for decades. No memorable characters or dialogue (some of the latter was quite cringeworthy though), no surprises in the arsenal available and a story like which you can fit thirteen in a dozen. Too bad, as the game seemed to be built on a technically solid basis, the graphics and combat pew pew were adequate for a game like this. I wanted to recommend this game, but simply can because of the (lack of) original content. "

												Splatter is the name and this game really do deserve it! It is fullblown action from the very first second 'til the last one. Actually I started today, took a break for a while (since I actually should have worked) but couldn't resist to go on playing 'til the end. So much fun mowing all those zombies with your weapons. Man....this is pure adrenalin. Usually I'm not that much a storyguy for actiongames, but this one is well made with short cutscenes between the levels.... loved this game!			"

												Nice indie game made with a lot of love for the old topdown shooter genre. The story is gloriously dumb but it's made entertaining due to its Max Payne noir sensibilties. I encountered a few glitches but nothing game breaking - overall it was very polished.There is a progression system in the form of an extensive range of upgrades for your weapons; by the end of the game you'll have collected 7 weapons in total and there are four upgrades per weapon, each of which affects said weapon in a different way. Money is limited so you won't be able to upgrade everything, which creates some replay value. It should take you around 6 to 7 hours to beat on the hardest difficulty.Would reccommend for some mindless fun.			"

												I'm not sure how I ended up with this game, I must have bought it a long time ago. While surfing my library I happened to see it and gave it a try. I gotta say, I really love it.It's probably my favorite twin stick shooter. Too many games just use arena or survival formats, this one has a plot, objectives and secrets a la Doom style. The graphics are also pretty great in my opinion for a game of this type.Two things I especially love about this game is that #1: There is a lot of variety. Almost every level introduces a new enemy, sometimes a new mechanic or a new weapon, which leads me to #2: None of the guns seem redundant. Every weapon is useful in certain situations. You're not gonna upgrade the heck out of one gun and use it the entire game, you'll be switching on the fly. Upgrades themselves are great too. Overall, I bought it at 4.90 USD and I'd say it was worth it, let alone now on sale for under a dollar. Also there is multiplayer, I haven't tried it yet so I can't comment on that.The only con's I can think of is that (one time for me) you can get stuck between objects and get trapped. Again, it happened once for me so it might have been a one time thing. Either way my autosave brought me back a whole five minutes so no big deal. Second is that flares seem a bit OP and you get a ton of them, but that's my opinion, plus I'm playing on normal and not hard. Third... lol the voice acting is horrendous. The main character does an okay job, but every NPC is laughably bad.PS: Almost forgot to mention, the sounds effects are awesome. From the gunshots and explosions to the various creatures moans and screams and explosive gory deaths. At .50 you'd be silly not to pick this up. Even if you, for some reason, don't like it... it's .49 cents...			"

												Great game, not sure why people dont think the controls are good, they are fine, like any normal top down mouse to aim shooter. Bought it because it was 91% off and why not at 15p, but to be honest Id have been delighted with the purchase at full price of under 2 quid. Quick download, easy to run spec wise (id imagine) so cant think of a single reason for you to not take the plunge and buy it.			"

												This game is like Zombie Shooter. The gameplay is simple yet addictive. For a game that costs almost nothing it has so much to offer.			"

												Enjoyable top-down shooter reminiscent of Gauntlet. Playing on Linux system and haven't encountered any of the bugs so far mentioned, including issues with controls: WASD and mouse work just fine here.You can't go wrong at the current price either!			"

												Completed game after 10.5 hrs and must say enjoyed every minute, this is only the second top-down shooter i've ever played the other being Shadowgrounds Survival which is good but Splatter- Zombie Apocalypse is better. A word of warning this game is hard i played on normal difficulty maybe should have started on easy because even on normal the Bosses on each level will end with your death quite alot but this game also comes with quick-saving even in Boss battles so progression might be slow but wont be halted. Windows 10, Nvidia GeForce GTX 770, Intel Core i7-3770, 3.40GHz. 16 RAM no problems at all. So be like me and give it a go you will enjoy it yourself.			"

												Got this on sale for $0.49 so take this with a grain of salt.That said, you get another generic zombie massacre game, there are already more than I could count out there, still this one is one of the better ones.Core gameplay works for what it is supposed to be, artwork is good instead of a crappy horrible mess like most other generic zombie massacre games, and even has a rather unique style to it.There is kind of a story that might work for some people, again not a horrible atrocity like in most other generic zombie massacre games, but you're probably not playing it for the story anyway.Even has some tactical depth to it if you play on hard mode.I've no idea why I'm writing this much about a game I bought for $0.49 so I'll just head out now...

												Aboslutely love this game.  An unhealthy mixture of pain and pleasure and it has a good enough story.  For the price you really can't beat it, I paid .49 cents for it and will likely do a couple playthroughs on the different difficulties.  Will edit this when I finally beat the damn lightning level.This game will surprise the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.			"

												Haven't played this kind of games in a long time, but the theme and neat graphics/engine hooked me. I couldn't try out the multiplayer which I'm sure would've been fun.I also love breaking stuff and a few of the mechanics they introduced thoughout the game. I just hoped they didn't advise on upgrading the pistol since you will get all the upgrades once you collect all the golden parts, and I could've upgraded other weapons.			"

												A trenchcoat and fedora wearing neckbeard who hates people and is misunderstood shoots some zombies. Gameplay and controls are good though for a top-down shooter and I had a lot of fun with it for 4 hours or so, easily worth $5. Framerate was consistent the whole way through and didn't encounter any bugs or technical issues.			"
