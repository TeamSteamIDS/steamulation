								It's like Pacman but with parkour and instead of ghosts you're trying to punch other pacmans to death.  The movement system is fun but the game beyond that feels kind of weird and it's not clear how much anything you do matters.  Getting killed puts you into this quasi-ghost state where you can sort of interfere with other players and have a 'tag' objective of a certain player to hunt down to earn points.  But the ghost objective doesn't really feel very satisfying and I think there's room to improve on this concept- it's just not good right now.  But it could be better.The 'stream interaction' aspects are a mediocre gimmick at best for 99% of the playerbase, only really being interesting for people who have thousands of viewers at any given time on Twitch.  While it's a cute idea, it basically means there's no way to actually play the game as intended unless you're big on Twitch.With some more work this could be a fun game, but right now it's clumsy and hard to understand on top of being very limited unless you're a big-time streamer.  I enjoy the base gameplay but it's not worth spending money on yet, and I hope it improves in the future.			"

								I initially got into this game because I thought, ""Hey free trip to Twitch Con if I can be good at this game."" Pro tip: Don't expect to win or be good the first time you pick up the game and definitely don't have your first game be in the comp itself, lol. However, that's not to say you won't shine when you log in the first time. Anyway, after suffering a shameful defeat, I was still drawn back to the game. I met players through the Proletariat discord and we ended up playing a lot together. After playing this game for about two months, I've made so many friends and met so many amazing people, including the amazing Proletariat team. This isn't just a game. This is a community full of such diversity and awesomeness. You'll always have someone to play with and you'll always be welcome on in. After their newest release and listening to some of the ideas thrown around, there's no stopping the progression of this game and there will always be something for everyone. As a note of their customer support? Outstanding. They're always willing to help and make sure you're able to get back to gaming asap. Even if it's late at night and they might not be around, if you pop into discord, there's almost always someone awake who may be able to help you out. <3			"

								This is a really fun game, especially with friends. I have been able to play quite a few rounds on stream, but also just joining a game in chat and alternating what is happening during the matches is great. You can bet on your favourite player, win points and use that to alternate the matches by adding things like ""the floor is lava"" and more extras. Controls are really easy to get to used to, and you can play this both by using a controller or a mouse and keyboard. The addition of character customisation by getting packs builds up anticipation and adds to the personisation of your game. More stuff is being added, so I am sure this will be a game to play for a long time.			"

								“Quite frankly, because we’re trying something that’s never really been done before. While there have been a few games with Twitch-interactivity built in, Streamline was built from the ground-up with Broadcasters and their audiences in mind. We’re trying to make real-time interaction between the Broadcaster, their players, and their.."" and on and on it goes, the sales pitch for streammote.tv. This game, in short, is just a way for them to sell a service to developers thinking streamers need more ways to connect with their audiences.Now, unfortunately for them, Lumberyard (free Cryengine 3 developed by Amazon) does this and more, ohh and BETTER. Holy crap, log into twitch to then get forced to log into their website to then force everyone who even remotely wants to play with you to do the same then hand them all streammote links to your channel to join the party because steamworks and all other easy stuff is for plebs.If you want to make a game to sell a damn website that just restreams twitch, you could have easily gone with a much more easy solution for the user. I can't see anyone bothering to put up with all the crap you need to go through to just make a party. Then face the ""Oops, not enough people to start playing the game!"".Free game or not, it's lazy, it's definitely not innovative in the slightest considering that other streamer-bait scare game did the same thing. Ofcourse, at the time of writing this game was free, when you read this it will probably be worth 20 euros or however much.For anyone interested, amazon just burried these guys before their game was even known. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/releasenotes/lumberyard-v1.6.html#lumberyard-v1.6-highlights-metastream-gem ontop of the ability to basically whisper game invites on twitch and a bunch of other goodies. ( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/chatplay-joinin.html )Ohh how does the game play? I wouldn't know, spent a good 20 minutes spamming ""Log in with Twitch"" which 504'd, 502'd or straight up gave me a generic error. Then once we got in, had to spend however long to figure out how to party with people and by then nobody wanted to even bother with the game. You click on Party and game just goes all ""Hey, check out this website for more info"". Because it knows that if it straight up told you that you have to sign to yet another website to access some super basic feature after signing into twitch to just access the damn game is a very stupid move. And so you click it, and the steammote site launches, which is just dominated by people playing -what else- Streamline, with signs and stuff to contact them if you are a developer, sign up if you are a broadcaster or log in if you are one of the people who wants to play with someone else but won't really bring them money (kinda like an extra in a movie, no fanfare there).Options-wise, it has nothing. 4 Presets to chose from (Low to Ultra), limited resolutions, no vsync and generally pretty barebones. If I didn't know better and saw that options menu I'd think it was some basic unity game.Ohh and can I say, they somehow managed to make the character creation pathetic, feels like no effort was put into it at all. You get some Rockband tshirts, a Portal and TF2 outfit then like 3 or 4 of their own stuff. And it all looks pretty weak. You get to pick one of 3 smurky-as-♥♥♥♥ faces that you would want to punch in the street if you found one, some clothes that look pretty uninspired and one of few haircuts. Don't worry though, they already got the majority of that ♥♥♥♥ locked behind a shop system that probably wants you to log on twitter or something before you can unlock anything.Atleast I didn't need to log into any websites to exit the game. I was actually half expecting I would be asked/forced to. ""Ohh you want to exit the game? Ofcourse, just sign into twitter, facebook, twitch and +1 our social media! THEN you can exit"".Having said that, for a lot of people the game does not run, for others the game refuses to exit and will stay running in the background.			"

								[Player review]My review of Streamline based on the experience of a player that does not stream.Streamline is in my opinion an incredibly fun and challenging game because it offers a different experience every time I play. This experience is formed and changed each time by the Players,Viewers and Rules which change every time I play.The movement in Streamline is easy to jump into but requires some practice to get down, don't be afraid to maybe lose a few matches while getting into the game. Once you get the movement in the game down however it opens the gate to play every match in a diffrent style. Be it avoiding the hunter by staying on map wide distance of him/her or challenging the hunter straight on and getting that satisfying ""Bear wrestler"" accolade at the end of the match by stunning the hunter throughout the game.The look of the game is very cartoony which bases on your prefrences can be either a pro or con.The ability to join and play with a streamer and his/her community can be enjoyable yet for some perhaps a bit scary.For those who enjoy meeting new people I encourage joining on going streams to chat and play together. For those who do not feel the need for community play there has recently been an update which added a ""Quick Play"" mode. This allowed for players to play without being forced into a new group of people, this mode even eliminated the dependency on streamers to host in order play the game.For streamers who have a smaller group of viewers getting a good feel of the game might feel a little bit challenging at first. However it is still possible to get the most out of Streamline.Streamers are for example able to open their game to both viewers and ""Quick play"" players, this makes it easier to gain a full party without having a big viewer base. ( The downside is that these players might not join the stream and will thus not join in on the betting and voting/buying rules.)Another way to gain more players is the publicly open discord from the developers ""Proletariat"". In the discord Streamers are able to advertise to and communitcate with player and other streamers, this often increases the players who are both active on streamote and in-game.A last option would be to join with multiple streamers in one hosted game, through using the (Streamote.tv/Hostofgame/via/secondstreamer). this way each streamer has their own streamote channel and viewers but the betting/voting/buying is shared.Thus yes, it might be hard at first but there are options provided to help you at it.Since there has been quite some changes and additions to the game I will not review this until further in developemnt.I hope this adressed some of the important aspects for players/streamers deciding to play and/or buy streamline.

								Runs smooth for an EA game. Multiplayer is deader than your grandma's grandma. The game expects you to know everything right off the bat when you launch it the first time. That means, no tutorial. Practice mode? You run in a map collecting points for nothing. No bots, no goal, nothing.  Don't ever get this game.			"

								Game looks great and *can* be fun at times but unless you're a streamer who has thousands of followers the game is kind of dull, as just a regular player or a small time streamer nobody bets and the 'viewer interation' is really no better than just having the 'rule changes' on random, they always happen at periodic intervals and never felt like they had any real impact on the game. If you are interested in the game buy it have a play around for an hour or so, you will have played the whole game by that point and can decide whether or not you want to refund it. PS. No Oceanic servers for my Australian bretheren so keep that in mind.			"

								***I'd like to mention upfront, plan on playing this game with a community to get any fun out of it, otherwise it's going to be a lonely experience.***So that's out of the way, it can take a bit to get your bearings and understand what's going on. Really after a match or two you'll quickly find out it's basically like a 3d Pacman where a bunch of players are trying to collect points, and one ""hunter"" is trying to eliminate them. But that's not quite the whole picture; the community portion involves players using an app/twitch to vote on rules on a game in progress. This is where the magic is! Mid-game you can expect floors to turn into ice or lava, weapons to turn into pool noodles, players to randomly explode on contact, just crazy #$#@!If you can get passed the initial confusion, this game can be a blast. Especially if you are tuned into twitch while playing and getting everyone's reaction to the action on screen. Totally worth it!			"

Early Access Review
Streamline is a fun multiplayer action game filled with parkour, sprinting, gathering points and hitting players.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You have to run around, being careful not to get hit by the player, currently holding the stop sign. While doing that, you have to gather as many points as possible to climb on the leaderboard. If you get hit by the player with the stop sign, you become the holder of the sign and you are not able to collect points until you manage to hit a player. While the chase is ongoing, random events also occur, an example of those is lava floor.Pros: Graphics | The game looks quite good. I really like that everything is bright and colourful, which is something that I miss in a lot of games. The game itself is quite fast-paced and a different colour scheme would probably confuse players if too many things would be going on at the same time. Animations such as jumping and wall running are also surprisingly well-made. Movement | As mentioned before, this game also includes wall-running, which is very fun to do. Wall-running in weird places usually also enables you to get much more points, which makes it an essential skill to be able to compete for the highest places on the leaderboard. You also have double jumping and trampolines. With those, you can jump really high and have a lot more fun. Character Customization | I was really surprised by the amount of character customization this game is offering. You can change almost everything: your shirt, your pants, your shoes, your face, your skin and so on. Most of the available items also have a number of different colours to choose from, which lets you create the perfect colour combination for you. Twitch Integration | Although integrating Twitch so deeply into the game also has a big downside which I will mention later in this review, I have to say that it also brings a lot of fun into this game. As one viewer sets up his stream, other players can join his party. Viewers of that person's stream can then bet on any player in the party they want using their in-game coins. They can also select an event, which will then occur in the game and influence all players. (Random) Events | As written above, viewers of one's stream can pick an event that will influence the game. If there aren't viewers or none of them choose to pick an event, an event is selected randomly every once in a while. Those events can really make the game much better. Let me list some of those events: Lava Floor (you must not touch the ground or your die), No Touching (if you touch another player, you die), Concrete Feet (you can't double jump), Continuous Jumping (you can't stop jumping) and a few more. I probably got a few names wrong, I apologise for that. Maps | There are currently 6 maps in Streamline, all of them are quite good. Some of them have more trampolines than others, some have much better wall-climbing. If you get to choose the map, there is certainly a map which is right for you. Pack Drops | After most matches, you will get a pack of items shaped like one of those bags you go to fitness with. The better you perform, the better are the chances of getting a pack of higher value. Each pack contains one or two things. You can either get a new item (most commonly a piece of clothing, a hairstyle or a pair of shoes) or, if you get two items, the second one can be a new colour for one of the items you already have. I really like that you get those packs so often because there are quite a lot of things to be unlocked. Achievements | There are 49 achievements in this game and they contribute a lot to the overall quality of this game. They are really fun to achieve as they actually reward you for something special you do, not for grinding something for a long time.Cons: Twitch Requirement | As much as Twitter integration can be fun, I find it weird that you can only play the game after logging in with Twitch and setting up some things first. I don't really have a desire to stream my gameplay and I'm also not really keen on being on someone else's stream. Developers are supposedly thinking of getting rid of this requirement, but as of now, it still exists in the game. Hit Detection | Sometimes, you get hit by players that are not really that close, but you still get hit. If you figure how to use this, it's very easy to kill other players, which is (in my opinion) giving an unfair advantage to some players. Connectivity Problems | When I try to start playing, I am sometimes not able to do so because of some server communication problems. The issue usually goes away in a few minutes and it's not really that often, but it's still worth mentioning. Resolution Issues | When I play in fullscreen mode, I can't see all of the menus properly. When I wanted to check the commands in the options menu, I had to switch to windowed mode, or some of the menu would be cut off for some reason. Pricing | Honestly, I'm not sure if $20 is the right price tag for this game. Sure, it has a lot of content and it's pretty fun, but for $20 you can get some much better games-The final verdict:The game is certainly very fun. Although it was lacking players a month ago, the influx of new players certainly gave this game a huge boost and now it's not ever a problem to find somebody to play with. The game looks awesome and plays awesome, which outweighs most of the negative things in this game.If you're looking for some fun multiplayer action, this is certainly the way to go. Although the price is a bit high, there's no reason not to get this for yourself when it's on discount.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. "

								You must have a Twitch account to start the game.  That's annoying, but whatever.  So I logged into Twitch.I then tried to play multiplayer and found out I also needed a Steamote account.  WTF is Steamote?  Okay... second account created just to attempt to play the game.I joined a match, which involved running around collecting gems while 1 player tried to spank me with a stop sign.  The gems provided me no benefit whatsoever.  There is no end goal, you just collect gems until the time runs out.  Whoever collected the most gems wins.  There are no power-ups for you to pickup and use, no real player interaction other than occasionally spanking people, and no real variety to the gameplay.  That's boring...So 3 strikes already and I haven't even attempted to play with friends yet.  Now I invite my buddy to join me and we attempt all kinds of things to get into a game together.  This process is so convoluted that the game isn't even worth playing.  With the game running, you have to [Alt]+[Tab] out of the game and access the Steamote website.  One player must then create a party and all other players need to go to the party's webpage in order to join the game.  Then (for private games) the host has to manually approve each person who attempts to join the party (the host cannot simply invite friends).  When you think you're done, [Alt]+[Tab] back into the game and discover that Steamote didn't actually work, so you have to repeat the invite process.  Maybe it works the second time, maybe it doesn't.  If not, you see if you can find some random other person's public game that has enough open slots for you and all your friends.  Finally, you can play the game.Then you remember the game is unbelievably boring and playing with friends doesn't make it any better.I played about a dozen matches on the various maps and with various player counts.  The game simply doesn't offer anything that makes it worth coming back to.			"

								Opinion:**I love this game- when I found out about it this summer I was blown away that more people weren’t paying attention to it.  As a streamer on Twitch I am always looking for games that get the chat involved- many times the game I am playing has zero integration and occasionally it is nice to provide an experience that is all-inclusive for the viewers.  Here's the basic gameplay description:There is one game mode currently: Elimination which pits the “hunter” against the “runners” to gather the most points before getting eliminated! The parkour movement allows everyone to get around the level with ease: double jump, sprint, power slide, and dodge left/right. The hunter is the only one with a melee weapon and their goal is eliminate the runners- pretty simple! The hunter also recharges stamina over time where the runners are vulnerable with limited stamina (runners pick up lightning bolts to refill it). The hunter is normally the host of the game who is streaming on Twitch but you can also choose another person to be hunter or a random choice.The runners can punch the hunter / other runners if they have good timing and use the parkour movement to avoid them.  If you get eliminate you come back as a ghost to “haunt/grief” other runners. Press G to taunt their failures (or pay your respects).It’s a tug of war to get the most points with unpredictable rulesets that are voted on in the chat through the proprietary streamote.tv site where you (using a virtual points system) can bet on who wins, buy rules from the rules store, vote on rulesets during the game, and play Bingo!  Chaotic, action packed with an excellent soundtrack that will leave your head bobbing involuntarily. (available on Spotify, Google Play etc.)How to get started:Once you launch the game you will connect your Twitch account which is super easy to do- then your ingame name will match your Twitch name.Click on inventory* to customize your character- before you “get good” you gotta look good. Just sayin’!!The options menu has the ability to view / rebind controls (I play with inverted mouse).If you are a solo player you can just hit quick play* and get into the action- you will be assigned to a random party.  Once you find a game you can go to the host’s streamote.tv site- for instance if Kappa was playing Streamline theirs would be streamote.tv/Kappa However, where this game shines is the Twitch integration for streamers- using the streamote.tv site that gives everyone something to do- the host (streamer) chooses who is allowed to join the party- open for anyone to join including those who use the “quick play*” feature, invite only to choose specific people, and subscribers only for a quick and easy Sub Sunday event!  The party system even detects who owns the game for ease of use when inviting players.  One of my favorite additions recently was the quick play* feature which allows new players who don’t understand how the streamote.tv site works yet a way to get into a game and meet other players.  And this is a game that can get quite competitive- I was recently at TwitchCon and saw in person how the skill ceiling for Streamline is something that no one really expected.  I got a chance to talk to the best players in the game right now and they are all very friendly but once the game starts so does the competition.  Conclusion / tl;dr:A fast paced, smooth parkour Pacman where one hunter aims to eliminate the runners asap!  A great game for streamers to involve everyone in the chat and get things hype!  The current game mode is limited and there is a high ceiling for potential other game modes.  Team Elimination will be all I play once that mode is finalized. Currently there are 5 maps and many different customization options including exclusive Steam items or Twitch Prime items if you end up owning that version too (free on Twitch Prime through October).  As a streamer this is a must play- if you are the competitive type you can try to take the crown from the best players currently.  Best and only game of its type out there. Worth.*Inventory and Quick Play, other features are this way as of the current version and may be subject to change.**Objective opinion, not compensated for this review.  I received this game for free as part of the alpha testing phase. "

								After sitting down with Streamline for just a few hours, I know this is definitely a game to watch. It's still in early access, with a few rough edges, but Proletariat looks to be pouring additional support into the game, so I'm guessing we'll see a lot of improvement. In the meantime, it's a pretty great game for some quick multiplayer sessions.First off, player movement is a blast. While it's super easy to get the hang of wall-running, double-jumping, and boosting around a level, the best players I faced were able to pull off some amazing moves. (Very much in the ""how the heck did they do that"" vein.)Rounds are also quick, and eliminated players don't have to just sit and watch the remaining runners play. They can interfere as ""ghosts,"" stunning other players and chasing after ""haunt"" targets for extra points in the round. (Yes, you can keep scoring points when you're dead.) Some of the game mods play around with ghosts as well, like giving them the ability to eliminate other players or even come back to life for a short time.I did have a few issues with the game: between each game you have to wait a few minutes while stream spectators place bets on the players and use their stream currency to purchase what game mods will appear in each round. If you're not engaging with the stream, (which as far as I can tell requires running Streamote in the background,) this part of the game can drag on. More integration of the stream tools and chat with the game itself is something I'd look forward to in the future.The game mod system in general also adds some great variety to each round, but otherwise it's mainly there to give spectators a way to interact with the game, since players don't interact with it much themselves.If you're a streamer, this game is a must, even in Early Access, but even if you don't stream, there's still something here for you. I imagine it's especially good for LAN parties or played wherever you and your friends can smacktalk each other.			"

								Streamline looks more complicated in gameplay videos than it actually is. Within a few rounds you can get a good grip of the game. The game can include up to 16 players. 15 Runners plus a Hunter. The Hunter has the ability to kill the Runners in one hit. The runners compete for points by collecting orbs of differing values while using a dash meter. The dash meter is filled by pickups and you gain more points if you collect orbs while dashing. The movement in the game is context sensitive, as you can wall-run and do similar acrobatic feats while holding a button. If you are killed, you become a ghost. A ghost can no longer collect orbs, but can gain an increasing amount of points by punching a randomly assigned, still-alive runner. The game is played in 3 rounds that last a few minutes and the point total is cumulative, so if you die early in the first round, you can try to make up for it in the second round (and perhaps sabotage the runners who have amassed more points than you). If you are still alive at the end of a round, ghosts disappear and a sudden death commences, where you are finally able to kill the hunter by landing a hit on him, you just have to survive long enough and land a hit. The Hunter is scored via a letter grade (F- to A+ it seems), while the runner with the most points wins.There is intergration with twitch, as you can host or join lobbies by linking your twitch account in-game and then using the developer's twitch player at https://streamote.tv/. You do not have to install anything, as some people seem to be confused on how this works. The end result is that you are able to find lobbies via this website, join a party, and play with a streamer (or if you are a streamer yourself, host). Viewers are able to view the stream of the game and use a point system to influence the game through different global buffs/debuffs that they choose when to activate. They can also bet on who they think will win and rack up more points via bingo in the lobby.To put it simply it's a competitive score-based platformer with asymetrical gameplay (Hunter, Runner & Ghost). It also involves optional stream integration, so that viewers may influence the gameplay. It's still early-access at this point, but feels solid and I have enjoyed the quirky experience so far. Recommended.			"

								For a game based around movement, its movement system is very clunky. The whole Twitch.tv integration seems to have taken up most of the developer's time since that seems to have more effort put into it than some of the basic gameplay mechanics.			"

								This game is a great time! It's easy enough that anyone can pick it up and run, but there is also a great community of people who have pushed their game further. Every skill level is welcome and with the stream integration on Twitch it's a blast for streamers and viewers alike. Viewers can change the game in an instant by enacting rules that they've purchased or voted on. They can also play bingo and bet on players. If you're looking for a game to get your entire channel active, this is the one for you!			"

								Game is DOA. Matchmaking is a !@#$ing joke. Found one match where a team of level ones was up against a level 40 and a level 29.That's the only match I found. I waited for 10 minutes to find another match and found nothing.If they can fix baby's first matchmaking system then this game potentially has a chance. I do see a lot of potential in this game, especially with Twitch integration.But as it is now you can only have fun playing this with friends, and even then Move or Die is a much better game.			"

								I know I haven't played a lot, but I feel like I should give this game recognition.From what I've played, nice game that fills an arcade niche and has a pretty good stylised art style.I think the number 1 problem with this game is the lack of people playing it. It has the potential to be a fun little game to mess around in or join up with friends, but there are simply not enough people playing to warrant the price tag.It's not a super serious esports-level game, which is great, because it's accessible. If this game goes on sale, give it a shot, because it just needs the boost in playerbase to become a fun way to pass time.That's just my opinion though.			"

								I love this game, but there's some caveats I need to address.PROS: + Really fun+Unique game+Good personalization toolsCONS:-Lack of graphic settings customization-Not worth $20 imo (get it on sale, i got it on a promo where it was free)Also, one note. The servers are usually empty or there are a few people on. Occasionally you will get on a full server, but you have to try a couple times to get on a populated server. I like how they integrated Twitch. It's a great way for Twitch streamers to interact with their audience in game.Would I reccomend this to a friend...? maybe. If it's on sale then yeah totally! Even if you buy it full price, it's a good game. After all it's only in Early Access.			"

								This game was made for streaming! I like how it lets your viwers interact with and affect the game, while at the same time events ingame affect minigames in your chat.Viewers can easily join the game and/or play the other half of the game, which happens in your stream channel, where they can add events to the game to help or grief you or the other runners. Ingame, the players are running to collect the most points from orbs, while trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same. These actions and other ingame events appear on bingo sheets played by your channel viewers. Beware of the opponent wielding a stop sign! Avoid getting tagged or killed, depending on the game mode (more modes have been announced). If killed, you get to haunt opponents until sudden death.Visitors to your channel earn coins (or whatever you decide for your currency) that can be used to bet on the players, Betting and bingo winners will recieve coins (or whatever... my channel has cookies!) and ingame character customizations.You don't need to stream if you just want to play. You can also host a party without playing ...or switch between the two. Also, you can play bingo in multiple channels at once, if there are other streamers in the party.Good investment for streamers, great fun for everyone!

								Surprisingly good. Aim of the game is to collect the different coloured orbs for varying amount of points which eventually leads to a sudden death, most points wins. Modifiers are constantly changing the game and aren't irritating which is refreshing and gives it a ton of replayability. The movement system as well is brilliant (Parkour, Sunset Overdrive style), the maps have been designed in tandem with the system and being able to string together lines of orbs never felt better. No issues with the game so far besides some connection at launch however considering this is thousands more players than they are used to they are excused as far as I'm concerned, they had no idea it would be this popular presumably.TL:DR: Brilliant game, fast paced and brilliant movement mechanics, refreshing modifiers, lots of replay value.

								This is a really fun game, especially with friends. I have been able to play quite a few rounds on stream, but also just joining a game in chat and alternating what is happening during the matches is great. You can bet on your favourite player, win points and use that to alternate the matches by adding things like ""the floor is lava"" and more extras. Controls are really easy to get to used to, and you can play this both by using a controller or a mouse and keyboard. The addition of character customisation by getting packs builds up anticipation and adds to the personisation of your game. More stuff is being added, so I am sure this will be a game to play for a long time.			"

								Streamline is fast-paced game with 2 (technically 3, but two of them are similar) game modes. In the first one a player tries to hit all the other players with a stop sign, while everyone else collects points by doing parkour across various terrains. The second game mode is similar to quidditch in that players try to score goals with a golden ball, but they still do parkour rather than fly on brooms.Players move very fast and rounds are full of additional effects that influence each game (chosen either randomly or by viewers' vote if the game is being streamed on twitch). Things such as the floor turning into lava, players exploding if they touch each other and the camera view rotating at disturbing angles make the gameplay diverse during each game.Moreover, you customize your character with items gained from packs which you open out of play similarly to Hearthstone. From making your character run around in their underpants to having them wear antlers, a gas mask or a hoodie. You can even change your race and gender at any time. Also you have a taunt action which makes your charater do a little performance such as doing the chicken walk or dabbing. It's perfect for when you want want to show off while winning the game.I got Streamline during a free weekend that was held a few months ago and I've been hooked ever since. I already reached the maximum currently available character level but don't plan on stopping. I just find it that much fun.P.S. As mentioned above all in-game items are cosmetic, so they don't influence the player's perfomance in the game, i.e. the game is not pay2win. So only play if you've got da skillz :P			"

								I think This is a really neat concept. being able to interact closer with twitch streamers and viewers by affacting the playing field in many different ways. I was fortunate enough to get this game during a livestream for GassyMexican which winners of the games would get to compete at twitchcon, Twice had i been chosen to compete alongside others, unfortunately i had tech difficulties on my end with connection and my laptop not being as powerful as it ought to be to load the game quicker. But playing in training mode to familiarize myself with the game mechanics it is quite the fun game to play.You can wall-run, jump off the walls, double jump, you can crouch and slide across the ground, you can dive left or right to avoid getting slammed by the twitch streamer's Stop sign, and be the one to collect the most points in the end and then everyone turn their gazes at the twitch streamer and kill him.The idea of allowing even the viewers to participate in the game even if they cannot afford it is quite something. I've seen games where it's just voting by typing a word or phrase in the chat, but with streamline and the twitch modifications, it makes it more enjoyable by selecting different power ups, modifiers that could help or ruin players, Bet with streamote currecny on who you think will win (not real currency) play bingo with everyone and earn more streamote currency. I really enjoy the game and would like to play this on my stream someday. first i must amass a following to do that. sadly having 7 followers who rarely appear won't be enough. feelsbadman			"

								Streamline is an alternative pvp title that is balanced towards quick bursts of gameplay during which you parcour around the arena and try to earn as many points as possible while dodging beaters that trade off when they tag you.  Matches are just long enough that you can squeeze in a match when you have some down time and aren't quite sure what you feel like playing next.  You can tell that the developers took careful care to balance the gameplay, ensuring that the matches never lull through use of dead zones and gameplay modifiers that occur over the course of a match.  The avatar customization is a bit basic, hat/shirt/pants and colors for each, but at the very least there are plenty of options to unlock for each of those slots.  Ultimately, the only downfall of this game is that the timing of the release ensured that this diamond is completely buried by not only the rough, but bigger and nicer diamonds.  It is hard to get those moments of downtime that this game could capitalize on when you could be busy playing the new Overwatch patch, Final Fantasy 15, Titanfall 2, Watchdogs 2, etc.  It is a shame because for what its worth, Streamline is a fun game.  It just lacks a thriving community because everyone is busy with other titles.			"

								It's an amazing game. Even at a $20 pricetag you get great value. No P2W features. You play with a ton of streamers and when you join their discord you end up meeting a ton of cool people. They are pulling the Twitch community together quickly.As far as the game goes it's extremely addicting and fun. We've already had tournaments with cash prizes and contributed tons to the game. The Devs are amazing and interact with their community. They listen and you may end up seeing your idea implemented into game.Yes there are bugs (most are rare and you may not ever see one), it's in Alpha, the Devs are working very hard to address those. Obviously there were technical issues when they released the game for 24 hours as F2P. All games have that issue when their servers are flooded. Nonetheless, the game is still fun. :DSo what are you waiting for? Join their Discord, get the game and have a blast!!!Happy Hunting "

								 PARKOUR and PLAYING TAG on fun maps is a great combination for a multiplayer game. Some people might get put off when they first start the game and it asks you to login with your Twitch account. A lot of people are not even going to try it because of that, and I think the developers made a mistake forcing it. It's a shame too, because you don't need to stream it, just make an account in a second (if you don't have one) and you can join a match instantly. The game itself is very fun and fluid. Running around, doing parkour, jumping, fighting other players in mid air, wall running, cool tricks.. It has it all.			"

								When I first looked at this game I wasn't too impressed by the images. I was putting the game off until I randomly searched it on Twitch out of curiosity. I've watched the same stream play the game for about 2 days before deciding to install it myself(Twitch Prime game at the time) and just jump into it. Was a bit confusing at first but I eventually understood how to pull myself near 1st place every time. Now I'm pretty much one of the tougher players in this game.So I figured I'll write a positive review after playing the game for 70+ hours.Streamline is a fun game once you understand the mechanics well enough.  If you watch a lot of Twitch and a streamer you like play this game weekly then I would recommend the game to you. Otherwise I would say wait till the game becomes a bit more feature complete. The devs are active and the regulars of the game are mainly helpful to new players. I may be terrible at describing this game to people... I mean I tell every new person this game is ""Mirror's Pacman Extreme Tag Edition + Viewer Trolling DLC.""To sum up the game for now.-Run around and gather points to be the highest scoring player in the round.-If in a streamer's lobby you'll have viewers on that stream voting for random rules to help or mess you up!(Don't need the game for this).-There's a player with a stop sign that like hitting other players.-The game seems to be a quest to see if you can dress your virtual character in random outfits. 11/10.

								First let me say i'm not very good at games, that being said i love this game even if winning doesn't happen. I've met so many new amazing friends playing this game i love the community that's being built around this game. I think the twitch integration bingo/betting is my favorite part, i like hanging out in Streamline streams that have a lot of people from the community on discord voice chat, the ""playful"" trash talk is amazing.Overall the game does take some skill and can be very challenging depending on the group you're playing with. The developers of the game are very community minded, they have a constant direct line open on their discord to problem solve and to receive feedback because they care about the community, most problems are addressed immediately and taken very seriously. So yeah if you see negative posts here in regards to tech issues they've probably been handled long ago or are issues they've been made aware of and are being worked on. Definitely recommend this game to everyone.			"

								This game is very fun. Runs extremely smooth for an Early Access title and has fun gameplay! The game is a combination of Parkour, freerunning, tag, Pac-Man and sudden death matches. It just took a couple of rounds to learn how the game worked. I recommend the game when it goes on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Thank you for the free game devs! It's a great game! Like a 3D pacman. Running around parkour style collecting points and avoiding the hunter. Still, finding a game and connecting to it should be easier. Also please dont force people to sign up for twitch - kinda sucks that you need a twitch account to play this game! UPDATE: According to the devs they will be changing all of that in the near future (see comment section) At this point the game is really promising but still needs a bit of work.Try it if you like the concept!P.S. Check out the trading cards for this game if you are a badge collector - they are rather cheap at the moment!			"

								A breath of fresh air!Streamline has me hooked! The interaction between Twitch chat and the game keeps you on your toes (never know when fallen players will rise from the dead and beat your points out of you!) . Broadcasters will flock to ths interactive game for their chat and fellow opponents. Always fun for chat to grief the players with Ugh, Ice Level and The Floor Is Lava events!Aside from the hijinks, the game has some great customization options; which is always a plus for me in any game. I can swap from a sporty look one game to a kawaii fox outfit, then taunt my foes with a victory Moonwalk. If you're looking for a fast paced game with shifting in-game events that you can play with a great community, Streamline is a great addition to your library!			"

								The game works well with relatively big or small streams, and while the mechanics are simple (the hunter has to find the other players), it definitely keeps you engaged and includes the viewers as well. The player's ability to go after remaining survivors even after death and the betting system make it even more fun. You can also hit people with stop signs.10/10 would crab core again			"

								First and foremost a super fun game. Gameplay is tight and fluid both as the hunter and as a runner. What really makes it shine is the Twitch integration: people can play along while watching and actually influence the arena in the game they're watching. Easily the best-in-class game for streamers and their fans to play together.			"

								Streamline is a really neat parkour game where you run around collecting ""gems"" all while trying to survive and eliminate other players. I really like the art style and smooth gameplay. Right now I feel like the biggest issue is that Streamline has a very low playerbase. Hopefully as development continues the game gets more press and can be pick up in popularity. I recommend anyone interested try it, its not bad, even if it has low population at the moment. The game is actively being developed but fingers crossed that it makes it through early access.			"

			My review of ""Streamline"", multiplayer free-for-all game about free-running with Twitch integration developed and published by Proletariat Inc. Copy supplied by developer.		

Game: StreamlineGenre: Free-for-All MultiplayerDeveloper: Proletariat Inc.Publisher: Proletariat Inc.Copy supplied by developerStreamline is a multiplayer free-for-all game about free-running with Twitch integration developed and published by Proletariat Inc.GRAPHICSDeveloped with Unreal Engine 4, the game's cell-shaded graphics and cartoonish look are polished and pretty. While nothing mind-blowing, each level looks and feels different, and there are enough small buildings to climb and crates to vault without being too big or overcrowded.GAMEPLAYThe game is a 16 player free-for-all version of Tag. One player is the Hunter, and he has to hit another player to make him become the Hunter, while everyone else is a Runner, and they have to collect as many points as possible.The free-running feels smooth but never too fast for its own good. The big gimmick of the game is that it is integrated with Twitch, and viewers can interact directly by adding powerups and variables: turn the floor to lava, force all players to jump or only move sideways, remove all points from the map, etc. They are fun and they do make each game feel different from the others.The only issue I have is that it lacks variety at its core: there are no other game modes right now, and there is a lack of players, so good luck in finding a full server.CHALLENGEThe game isn't particularly hard, and you get the grasp of the controls and parkour very fast. Runners can punch each other to steal points and let the Hunter get to them first, but it still isn't enough to change the tides of your situation. It is really hard for you to succesfully recover from a last position after the first round, but thankfully the game is pretty fast and you can level up pretty easily nontheles, making the experience not frustrating.SOUNDThe soundtrack by Matthew Harwood and Breakmaster Cylinder is solid and fun, bringing a lot of energy to the game. The sound effects are fun, with a couple of noises that tend to get annoying in the long run.REPLAYABILITYThe Twitch integration and its Early Access status make this a solid game to play multiple times in the future. Hopefully the player base will increase.Overall, this is a solid multiplayer game with a nice gimmick and solid controls. Recommended!Story: n/a

Early Access Review
								So far, I love this game. It might take you a bit longer than some to get the hang of, if you're stoned like I was when I first tried (lol) but once you get into it, it's actually pretty entertaining. Love the lighting effects, the fast pace, the different modes you see throughout a single match, let alone a single round. I love the references to Valve games and others (TF2, Portal, Fallout (I'm *pretty* it's Fallout, at least), etc. I love the little bag drops you get after a match, unlocking new aesthetic and other implements to tune up your player as you go along, such as clothing/item colours, new clothes/shoes, new taunts etc.This game, from the start, made me think ""Pac-Man World meets Battle Royale"". At this early point, the only thing I would point out is that the required Twitch login and how it's implemented makes it difficult for plebs like myself who can't rightly figure out how to create a party to get a new match started (though I'd previously had a Twitch account, I was never an avid user by any means, so I'm unfamiliar with any sort of streaming interface).Overall rating of 8/10 for an early access game (and, note, at the time of this review this is still pretty early af access kinda, idk maybe? yeah.) One last thing: though I got the game for free, I'd say its well worth its actual list price.UPDATE: This will be kept in my review until I know why it happens or until it is fixed. Since updating the game, whenever I try to launch, it just crashes. Anyone else experiencing this?			"

								Ehh... well, I loaded it up and it appeared on my main monitor in the incorrect resolution. Took forever to get the options to to change the res. I don't like how I was forced to sign into Twitch account (why in ♥♥♥♥ would I want to do that) I almost quit the game when the resolution suddenly worked.10 minutes ago I started searching for a game on the EU Ireland server, still waiting.... not able to go back from the waiting screen so I guess I just sit here and wait for it to find a server that isn't there or I ctrl+alt+del this ♥♥♥♥.OK  so the match finally loaded up, I was finally given options to look at controls and options. Enjoyed the character creation, the game is ""fun"" but it's also ""not fun."" I played one match, came 3rd and I had no idea what I was doing. No InGame VOIP or Chat to speak of.6/10 - download for free, wait until it is further down the development .			"

								Parkour PacMan Tag with a frantic super smackdown at the end? Sign me UP. I'm a simple creature, and the game is fun, period. A match goingfrom a leisure point grabbing party to frantic dodging left me and my friends swearing vengeance at each other amidst laughter at every smack and punch. Any game that does that is my kinda game. No real complaints there that won't be tackled by the more critcal player. The character customization is well done and nice to look at; always addicting to keep winning new options so keep em' coming. (I wouldn't mind being able to wear some of the options in the hat section with the hair I actually chose, just to nit pick there.) As far as cons, my biggest is with the party creation. It was such a pain trying to hop into a match with my actual friends. Going through the join game option on your steam friends list isn't always reliable, and with streamote I'd get a full lobby easy on the first try, but it wouldn't attempt to refill as others were leaving post game. Also had some issues actually disbanding the party. I had to shut the game down a few times because it got stuck. I don't mind making a twitch account just to play, but I'm looking forward to the option to opt out of using it.			"

								Product received for freeI initially got into this game because I thought, ""Hey free trip to Twitch Con if I can be good at this game."" Pro tip: Don't expect to win or be good the first time you pick up the game and definitely don't have your first game be in the comp itself, lol. However, that's not to say you won't shine when you log in the first time. Anyway, after suffering a shameful defeat, I was still drawn back to the game. I met players through the Proletariat discord and we ended up playing a lot together. After playing this game for about two months, I've made so many friends and met so many amazing people, including the amazing Proletariat team. This isn't just a game. This is a community full of such diversity and awesomeness. You'll always have someone to play with and you'll always be welcome on in. After their newest release and listening to some of the ideas thrown around, there's no stopping the progression of this game and there will always be something for everyone. As a note of their customer support? Outstanding. They're always willing to help and make sure you're able to get back to gaming asap. Even if it's late at night and they might not be around, if you pop into discord, there's almost always someone awake who may be able to help you out. <3			"

								Want to play a hyper ♥♥♥ game of tag?! Streamline is it and them more with lots of random effects changing how the game flows. Honestly seeing some of the reviews here, a lot of the unrecommendations are for really petty reasons.So let me give you what you need to know.Each round is more or less 5 mins of playing human pacman, running and collecting points, beating up other Runners to steal their points, beating up the Hunter to get style points. Last 30 secinds become a free for all where you must smash bop and BONK everyone insight still you the last one standing. Lots of levels of mind-games are included. You also get loot after every game. So you feel rewarded regardless of what you do.The con, more or less it would be that you need a twitch account to play and even host matches.All and all it's shaping up to be a really great game, and I'm sure the full release will be something spactular with tons more stages and outfit items.

								An interesting concept that reminds me of the TF2 mod TF2Ware, but without the speed ups and minigames, rather competing for points while facing modifications to the game or the map itself placed by viewers. It's fun, simple, and easy. It's not very competitive too, allowing for a good casual experience to just have fun with other players while viewers vote on previously mentioned modifications.			"

								I've had Streamline since early alpha, and I'm still pretty excited whenever I see a party forming. It's a great way to relax for an evening- it's fun, lighthearted, and easy to get into. The poppy art style and kickin' music are easygoing and suit the game nicely. The character customization is especially fun- the sheer number of cosmetics ensures that you'll always get something new after a match.The gameplay is fast paced and fun, easy to jump into but contains several nuances that make it competitive for those who want a deeper experience. Things like dodge rolling and knowing your lines can separate a good player from a great player.I'm most excited about the new modes that Proletariat has been pushing out- Tag is an excellent addition to Streamline, and embraces the multiple ways to play and win a match. The extra maps that have been added are also super enjoyable- and super gorgeous. Overall I think that Streamline is definitely worth your time! It's fun to hop into a game with a streamer you know, even if it's just for a few rounds of Tag. For free, that game is a gimme- and a good way to kill an evening with a dozen of your buddies.			"

								Nothing beats the adrenaline of dekeing out all of your opponents, becoming the last person standing, and taking out the hunter yourself. Streamline is a great Parkour Multiplayer game that doesn't involve shooting, killing creeps, or magic. Currently, the population is fairly low, however, you can get a game during most evenings. When you get in, it's a ton of fun.			"

								While the game is very fun and interesting, it is really hard to find a match with more than 2 other people. I don't think it is worth the  $20 yet.

								De: www.crgamershub.clubLa oferta que encontramos en Streamline es sencilla, donde eres un Cazador o Corredor, si fuiste seleccionado para comenzar la partida como Cazador te ves en la necesidad de buscar a los demás jugadores para golpearlos y poder convertirte en Corredor, si te toca ser Corredor tu objetivo es conseguir puntos. El juego es desarrollado por el equipo independiente Proletariat Inc.Quizás la característica principal del juego sea el enfoque que tiene hacia la plataforma Twitch, que por si no lo conoces, es un servicio gratis para realizar o mirar streams de juegos de video, etc. El juego esta diseñado y creado pensando en ofrecer streams calidad. Stramline permite a los jugadores que utilizan Twitch para transmitir sus partidas interactuar con sus espectadores; los que estén viendo la partida pueden participar directamente en las rondas, apostando por sus jugadores favoritos, cambiando las reglas de las rondas en tiempo real y competir en mini-juegos.Lo mencionado en el párrafo anterior es posible gracias al Streamote.tv, un sitio web creado por los mismos chicos de Proletaria, una herramienta que permite a los streamers y espectadores interactuar entre ellos mientras juegan Streamline sin tener que hacer un desmadre en el chat de Twitch.El título se juega en linea, en partidas de hasta 16 jugadores, donde ya sea como Cazador o Corredor nos vemos enfrascados en partidas donde las reglas del juego cambian a según las elecciones de los espectadores de la partida, con game changers chistosos, como por ejemplo: uno de los cambios en tiempo real nos limita a solo poder caminar como un cangrejo, de medio lado (y haciendo pantomima de cangrejo), otras nos ponen a brincar durante un minutos (sin que lo queramos), otras ralentizan el tiempo y todo va en cámara lenta. También existen cambios en el mapa, como que empieza a llenarse de lava en el suelo afectando los jugadores, o el mapa se empieza a hacer más pequeño poco a poco. Acá pueden ver un video del juego que subimos a nuestra pagina de Facebook.Otra característica es la posibilidad de poder cambiar la ropa y accesorios de tu personaje, con cientos de combinaciones posibles dándole un toque mas personal, con distintas ropas y muchos colores divertidos.Streamline es un juego que podría ser más divertido, pero se queda un poco corto. El problema no es que sea poco divertido, el asunto es que el título es un poco lento, la jugabilidad se siente lenta, y se atenúa aun más cuando todo en el titulo se centra en correr. Para mi gusto los jugadores tienen poca velocidad, y eso le resta emoción. Los saltos, piruetas y plataformeo serían más emocionantes si el desarrollador le añadiera un poco más de velocidad a los personajes, convirtiendo la experiencia en algo más vertiginoso y dinámico.Los gráficos de Stramline son regulares, con un aire a Team Fortress y Battleborn, no son ni malos ni buenos. El audio es sumamente molesto para mi gusto, pero no es peor que el “reggaeton” de la vecina al frente de mi casa, así pues, es recomendable bajarle el sonido al audio y poner tu propia música para evitar algún cáncer en el tímpano.En corto, Streamline no lo hace mal, las cosas que merman la experiencia son fácilmente corregibles y con el tiempo podría ser un juego regular-bueno, vacilón para jugar con los amigos. Un juego que cuesta originalmente $20, lo cual es caro para la experiencia que ofrece, asi que mejor agarrarlo mientras se pueda.			"

Early Access Review
								For a full picture of what this game is like, there are plenty of reviews one can read, or even watch videos from your favorite streamer or ‘tuber and educate themselves about the game and all the small details it entails, I'm not here to write a full review, but to simply make a small first impression comment, which is the following;Streamline is the red-headed step child of what you would get if Mirror's Edge and Pixar decided to make the first community driven Parkour game that focuses on streamlined (har-har) map activities, rather then being open world, via the gratifying fast paced game-play and loot system akin that of Overwatch.However, the praises stop there.The game suffers from a chicken or egg situation, I cannot attest if it's because the community (at least here on Steam) is passing barely the 130 people mark on a day to day basis, or because the servers refuse to put people together, but the community is more scarce then even Dark Souls 1 ever was during past summer (and that's saying something considering networking was broken by BamCo in DS1 during 2016).Fan's don't want to admit this, but it's true, the matchmaking is a nightmare to say the least.On several occasions, in Streamline, I idled for not 5 or 10, but almost 50 minutes flat waiting for a match to start, and this is during mid-day in NA region, where apparently most users are online. I can only imagine what a pain it must be during the ‘off-hours’ (you know, when people are off work and actually can play games) when around those times, the population can drop as low as below 50.Forget about playing late at night, because unless you enter the Twilight Zone for EU and Asian time zone, and meet your occasional late time players, there literally won't be anyone playing.Say what you want, but if an old 5 year old ‘dead’ game which only has the most basic of networking (Dark Souls) still is able to have people playing together in less then 5 minutes, I think it’s fair to say Streamline has some issues.Even though in theory that shouldn’t be an issue, because a match is a match and a match can allocate up to 15 people, so at any given time, with about 150 people, I should be easily finding 10 matches ongoing, I still find myself barely scrapping by in 4 people matches.You best bet is to idle in Streamote and wait for someone to Stream the game then and join their public party. This is the best bet at finding constant matches, or wait for the specific week-days in which the Dev's themselves Stream the game, which seems to be always bursting with people strangely enough.Maybe Streamline will bounce (pun intended) around and become essentially a more casual version of Overwatch without guns, or maybe, some smarmy British accented ‘tuber will make a video and inject some new blood in the game, or maybe all those ♥♥♥♥♥ who were idling in the game for 10 cents cards will finally decide to play games instead of working for chicken feed.

								Streamline is a very fun and fast paced game, I recommend it totaly. even though I have very few hours in this game.It reminds me of the good old S4 League in some aspects, I want to see this game grow and become succesful when it comes out.Its best if you play with friends, but playing with random people is also very fun.I'd rate it 9 out of 10, because it still needs to add more gamemodes and such kind of things.Also it doesn't seem to be paytowin so thats great.

								It's obvious from the tutorial and my short time playing that Streamline desperately wants to be a fast paced free running three dimensional game. It's also obvious that it just isn't. The game is slow, the controls aren't smooth and responisve like you'd want them to be, and the game honestly just isn't fun.The visuals are alright, and character customization is varied and that's cool, but I'd pass on Streamline.

								I tried that game, Streamline for about 35 minutes according to steam. Had two matches.It's very .... Lackluster.The parkour is automatic, it doesn't control like you want, the maps force you get more enclosed as time goes on, and it's basically a giant game of tag where you people who aren't tagged can hit each other anyways.The performance runs fine, but the content is lackluster.Not to mention but the randomized effects caused by twitch streamers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful.Sjit like ""The floor is lava"" on maps where you legitimately can get trapped behind the lavaSlow down mode. No touchingThats not even the worst of it.The levelup system is slow as hell, I got second place in my first two matches in a row, and got 40/150 for each one. These are matches where you're expected to have 16 people in them.The map selection is also fairly limited.I got cycled back to my first map on the potential third round, except I couldn't even play cause I was sitting there for five minutes and nobody joined the lobby.While I admitedly got the game for free, it goes for 20 bucks, and i'd not recomend that price even for hardcore streamers.

								Set the Scene:1V1: My buddy and I playing tag.  He's looking for me when all of a sudden he hears ""JOHN CENA!"" as I come flying out of the rafters and stun him.  I laugh and start to run away only to have a stop sign cleave my skull in half.Honestly this game is fun with friends.  They need to add more maps, fix some glitches, and add more players.  But those are the only downsides for me.  Funny and trolly game.  Grab a few friends, join a tag loby, and remember what it was like to play in primary school.			"

								This has potential, but for now I have to recommend against spending money on it(though if you can get the free copy, may as well). I really dislike that you have to use a Twitch account to play, for one thing. Also, I do realize it's still early access, but I am reviewing the game as it is. I did not encounter any actual bugs, but I was incredulous to discover that even after relenting and signing into Twitch, if you play a game it signs you back out each time. Gameplay is only semi-intuitive, and there is not currently a tutorial(there is a practice mode, but even this is just puttng you in a level and literally just telling you to learn on your own how to manuver. Graphics are so-so, with minimal tweaking other than resolution(which also seems to reset itself.) It overall needs a lot of pollish, but at the core is a game that can be fun. I expect it will improve with patches and it may eventually be worth purchase, but as of right now it is not.			"

Early Access Review
								Streamline has nailed the party game format, but the most I can say is I'm glad I got it for free - It's mildly entertaining for about 30 minute sessions, but the problem with games based around Twitch interaction is that they're entirely throwaway.It's an incredbly simplistic game that already feels dated due to some of the terms in game (Ripperoni/Crabcore etc.) that are meant to be hilarious, but aren't funny the first time (Nor anytime after that) and ultimately makes the game feel like it should be played soley by the very audience it's going for; screaming Twitch users and their teenage fans that are entertained by random gameplay and XD humour. It's clear from the beginning that there's very little depth, in part due to the random nature of the modifiers that thrown in, which frustrate more than they entertain (Which I'm sure is great for the twitch audience, but not much fun for the player). The parkour mechanics are OK at best - the levels work relatively well around them but if I don't feel certain that I'm going to wall-run everytime I attempt to wall-run then you have ultimately failed at creating a good parkour game, nevermind any additional mechanics that improve a parkour game even further. The levels are a decent size but the way they're slowly closed off is frustrating and should probably only start in the sudden death section. The aforementioned section itself is quite annoying too, as the attack with the stop sign seems to hit enemies after the swing animation is finished but prior to the sign being placed on the characters back again, resulting in unsatisfying kills and frustrating deaths (I can't say that for certain, nor do I intend to go back and test if that is the case). I can't see the multiplayer community sticking around for long either (Especially with no in-game chat function or mode to just run around the maps with others). To sum up, it's not worth £15; maybe a fiver at most. If you manage to see this while the game is free for the day give it a download and see what you think, you might enjoy it more than I do. Maybe I'm reading too much into a game where you're supposed to just turn your brain off and have fun, but that just brings me back to my main point; it's a throwaway game. As my main interest in it was the parkour system which isn't particularly good, I won't be playing much more of it and I can't see many others playing it either.			"

Also it requires you to login to twitch (which is complete BS) and then if you want to play w/ friends it requires a sign in to another streaming site that I've never heard of			"

								Not worth $20 or it's sale price for $15, no real objectives in the game other than running around to grab light orbs and to hit your opponents around. Game is a mess with connection issues and optimization issues. Wait for several patches before you decide to buy the game if you still insist on doing so. Other free to play games available on steam which is much much better than what Streamline can offer you (Team Fortress 2, Warframe, War Thunder+ MORE or Garry's Mod for $9.99 which has way more to offer compared to Streamline)			"

								It's an okay game that some genius made a tedious task to even play. Do not spend any money on this - even for free it's not that good.You have to login throught twitch, when the match starts you have to wait an eternity for the match to start and the forced twitch integration might work for streamers, but for me as a normal player just deters me from ever trying to play it.Also, in the main menu one of the highlighted streams of this game was actually playing Rocket League, which I guess speaks volumes about how successful this advertisement of a game works.

								This game looks like TF2, a little sad that it chugs framerate like a dying alcoholic and the controls are sticky and the movement is a joke. The muliplayer matches take about 7 minutes to connect to if you get one at all. If you do manage to get in a game youll be stuck waiting for the match to end. Once youre in, you'll die by 6 level 30s or fall off the map, then the cycle is complete and restarts. Sorry, but even for early access the game shouldnt look and feel like absolute ♥♥♥.			"

And in theory, it doesn't look like something that should work...BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES.The character customizability also takes some time to develop [you need to unlock the assets] but once you get quite a few, it's a really deserve and time consuming process to make just the right character.

								Amazing fun addictive mp game that mixes parkour and tag with a lot potentinal!!(was early access when I got it + still is at the time of this review)Pros:-Super fun and addictive-Lots of stuff for char customization-Already has a nice number of stages and I hope more to come-Rly nice graphics-Never ever have I experienced lag/crashes or anything similarWhat it needs: (if they don't do it con list after it exits early access)-Few more game modes altho this one is pretty awesome!-More stages-Server list (for now u can either start o join a rnd game)-1 tinny fix -> if u respawn in a bad place or wrong time u insta die againAll in all this game is awesome and it will for sure become an even better full game once it exits early access.If u like parkour/competition/tag this is for you!!

								It's basically a game of Tag online. You run away from the Hunter if you're the Runner. You chase the Runner if you're the Hunter. There's a ranking to know who wins. You collect points from different things like attacking the Hunter when you're the runner, being the last man standing, collecting different floating circles, stealing points from different players by attacking them and many more. Main goal is to collect as many points as you can get to be the top at the rankings. I don't know the rewards on top cause I haven't achieved it yet.You unlock more skins as you level up. It can be your hair, outfit, shoes, taunts and many others.The only downside is I don't think there's a custom game wherein you can choose who joins your game. I'm fairly new to the game so maybe there is one, I only join games and not create one.			"

								So I was looking around twitter and I found that steam had a ""Free till November 18"" or something like that. I got the game, cause I thought it was a limited time play time... So like where you only have 5 hours to play it or something like that, but after that day it was still there. I didn't get it for my friend, who uses an account at my house. I was a bit bummed and was requesting it be free again. Nothing happened, and I never played it since. It's really laggy in game and a little on the menu. Game is really boring and enraging, not what I want from a parkour game (raging is understandable but this is because of fighting other players). I might go back to it, if they add a story mode or playing it locally with bots or something like that. I will give this a 4/10 until that is added. I can't recommend it yet.			"

Early Access Review
								So I was looking around twitter and I found that steam had a ""Free till November 18"" or something like that. I got the game, cause I thought it was a limited time play time... So like where you only have 5 hours to play it or something like that, but after that day it was still there. I didn't get it for my friend, who uses an account at my house. I was a bit bummed and was requesting it be free again. Nothing happened, and I never played it since. It's really laggy in game and a little on the menu. Game is really boring and enraging, not what I want from a parkour game (raging is understandable but this is because of fighting other players). I might go back to it, if they add a story mode or playing it locally with bots or something like that. I will give this a 4/10 until that is added. I can't recommend it yet.			"

								i really wanted to enjoy this game. but heres my few problems with it. for a game that kinda bills itself as speedy in general, the actual movement in game is pretty slow. consider it like Jet Grind Radio, instead of Jet Set Radio Future. same attitude, but much slower in all aspects. if they made the boost speed standard speed, and made boost faster, it might be more fun.but then theres the modifiers. ""cement shoes"", ""slow thuggin"". these pop up very rapidly, often just as the last one is ending. i had a match where the entire game was in slow motion because we got slow thugging over and over. these *might* make the game more fun, if they didn't happen so often. as it is, they kill the pacing. lastly, theres the ""closed area"" rule. where less than a minute into a game, half of the level gets closed off and kills you if you go in. this might be better as a more gradual effect, but no, its a big nope stamp coming all at once. on one level, in the last 3 minutes of a match, everywhere was closed off except for a narrow platform suspended between two buildings. locking off areas of a free running game sorta seems like a mis-step to me.in any case, this game has a serious problem of too many mechanics. cut out any two, and the game might be a lot more enjoyable. maybe future patches will help. as it stands, i cannot reccomend it.

								At this stage of the game, I'm going to say that it isn't satisfying to play. When you start up the game you are forced to use a twitch account which is unreasonable as you should be given the option to create an 'in-game' account. Also, when logging into twitch, you find the browser they set up is very slow and unresponsive.To create your own game you have to start streaming on twitch which for some can cause slow gameplay due to the strain on their internet. If you join someone else's game you find that their are 0 people in any lobby, other than you, which makes the game unplayable as you can't play with other players.The graphic quality is quite unusual as 'Low' and 'Medium' are quite unpleasent to look at and 'Ultra' causes PC's to start losing frame rate. 'High' quality is quite unusual to look at as there always seems to be a slight blur which can make it hard to focus sometimes.However, the game does seem to be quite fun with an emphasis on fast-pace gameplay with a  very simplistic look and  an exciting theme. Also, the Valve-themed cosmetics does bring in all the 'fan-boys and girls' to play which can bring in a larger audience to meet and play with.I can see the game improving in the future to make it actually be playable and functionable but at this current time; I would'nt reccomend this game untill a future update.

								Clearly designed to be FTP with micro transactions. I got this game for free, and it's an ok low strategy time waster. Basically just run around and hit people while collecting points. Had I paid $19.99 for it, I would have asked for a refund. Since the lobbies are pretty empty, wait for another free offer or wait for it to become FTP. That's the only way I can see this game gaining any sort of real following.			"

								Streamline is a game that's nailed the party game format, but the most I can say is I'm glad I got it for free - It's mildly entertaining for about 30 minute sessions, but the problem with games based around Twitch interaction is that they're entirely throwaway.It's an incredbly simplistic game that already feels dated due to some of the terms in game (Ripperoni/Crabcore etc.) that are meant to be hilarious, but aren't funny the first time (Nor anytime after that) and ultimately makes the game feel like it should be played soley by the very audience it's going for; screaming Twitch users and their teenage fans that are entertained by random gameplay and XD humour. It's clear from the beginning that there's very little depth, in part due to the random nature of the modifiers that thrown in, which frustrate more than they entertain (Which I'm sure is great for the twitch audience, but not much fun for the player). The parkour mechanics are OK at best - the levels work relatively well around them but if I don't feel certain that I'm going to wall-run everytime I attempt to wall-run then you have ultimately failed at creating a good parkour game. The levels are a decent size but the way they're slowly closed off is frustrating and should probably only start in the sudden death section. The aforementioned section itself is quite annoying too, as the attack with the stop sign seems to hit enemies after the swing animation is finished prior to the sign being placed on the characters back again, resulting in unsatisfying kills and frustrating deaths (I can't say that for certain, nor do I intend to go back and test if that is the case). I can't see the multiplayer community sticking around for long either (Especially with no in-game chat function or mode to just run around the maps with others). To sum up, it's not worth £15; maybe a fiver at most. If you manage to see this while the game is free for the day give it a download and see what you think, you might enjoy it more than I do. Maybe I'm reading too much into a game where you're supposed to just turn your brain off and have fun, but that just brings me back to my main point; it's a throwaway game. As my main interest in it was the parkour system which isn't particularly good, I won't be playing much more of it and I can't see many others playing it either.			"

								Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Parkour game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some resolution sizes available.You can play fullscreen, windowed mode and borderless window mode.There is a master volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a mouse sensitivity slidebar.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to play on the controller.There is a controller sensitivity slidebar.About the game.The game is fun at some points but at some points really stupid.  You are either a runner or a hunter in an arena, if you are a hunter (which is randomly selected at the start of the beginning), you will have a stop sign as a weapon. You have to find someone and hit a person with the weapon in order to insta kill it - when that person that has died is going to respawn back, he will become the hunter. The runners have to collect points (that looks like pacman balls) that is scattered all over the field. Hitting someone else, will steal some of the collected points in that match. There are 3 rounds, and each time a round is about to end. There will be sudden death.. Here comes the fun part.... If you have died before the sudden death has started. You will remain dead and you can't respawn back. If you get stunned or whatsoever before the sudden death has started. You will be in a disadvantage and most likely die. everyone has an insta kill weapon in sudden death and only has 1 life. At some time the arena match is getting shorter and some zones will be unable to play.If you are staying in these zones, you will slowly lose HP and eventually die.Character customization.Objective less/aimless wandering.Has sudden death but can be unfair at points.Level progression.Matches are relative short.Alot of loading time (joining/leaving lobbies and finding connection to server)Game is 20 bucks and this is way too much what the game has to offer.Pacman.Blurry graphics, even on ULTRA.Low replayabilty - after 5 games you know what to do and have seen everything.Other things.Has alot of references and memes from different game.You need a twitch account in order to play. You dont need to host and you can actually just join a server.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"

								A great concept that is terribly executed. You can't play the game without a Twitch account and additional third party accounts which I forgot the name of, not that it matters anymore... It should be an option, not a requirement! You create bunch of accounts inside the account... link friends etc just to find out your friends cannot join and after waiting forever you play with randoms. Lots of lag/desync. Basically a waste of time and effort, this might be perfect for people who have no life and enjoy waiting for nothing. Like this the game shouldn't exists but now that it exists in this form it should be 'free to play' with a donation option. Can't reccomend this at all no matter what. Hopefully this game will be ovehauled one day.			"

								It's nice game if you want something for fun.Played it for like 30 minutes and it's ok, but there are many things that triggered me a bit and hope they will be changed with time:- It relogs you every time you finish a game. Ffs, it triggers me so much!- When you click on setup stream, it auto opens Internet Explorer... Gods be Praised...!- Can't run it in 60 fps with GTX 650/i5 4440 :(So let's go to the Pro's:- Simple, take points and don't get smacked.- First time I see that kind of twitch interaction, that's the plus for authors.- Has its style and looks good, even if you run it on low.It is still Early Access, but hope you'll make it way better than it is now, would recommend it if you are bored and wanna play something for fun. May get start boring if you play it too much.EDIT:""Play without Twitch!A Twitch account is no longer required to play. Players can simply use their Steam name to play with their friends on Steam, join other matches, and more.""This is the recent update on Streamline which has caused downfall to it. I won't recommend this game until they revert it, the policy and rules of Steam are worse than Twitch so people with bad profile pictures and names will keep playing it (because who tf bans person who has almost nude ♥♥♥♥ on avatar, either male or female).

								Absolute load of crap, and I havent even gotten into a game yet.To start off with, you need to login to twitch which I didn't mind doing. EXCEPT the authorize button doesnt work 90% of the time so you can't actually login. If you do manage to login (somehow) and you want to play with friends, you then need to go to a slow ♥♥♥ site, link your twitch account and do some broadcaster bs. When you eventually get to start making a party, the search function doesnt work properly so you can't search for who you want to party with.0/10 spent all my time on the menus trying to get ♥♥♥♥ to work.

								This game, is not worth the price.I even got it for free actually, a friend told me it was free one day, but even then, I had fun for around 5 minutes, and that's it. Then I let the game open for the cards, and uninstalled it. But even then after the 5 minutes I played, not only was I bored of the exact same thing all the time, collecting some cube-things, and maybe becoming a ""hunter"" in multiplayer (basically a game of tag while you run and jump around for cubes, not saying others can't enjoy that of course btw don't missunderstand me! ) but the ""gameplay"", reminded me alot of another rly GREAT game! Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. An awesome game, for the same price. And the ""Ninja Run"" in said game, the way you run, which has more variety in movements actually, is the same. But cooler. Now if you go into those ""VR"" (virtual reality) missions, you also have brightly coloured places, and some cubes to get for points! =D So the same, but the difference is : Metal Gear Rising has a million times more content, those are just sequences thought of as mini-games, little challenges that's it not the whole ♥♥♥♥ing game, and does for most people and myself atleast, alot more fun. It's an actual game, not some mini-game or mobile game. And yes as I said above, I'm not saying people can't enjoy the game, I played it and I get what's entertaining about it, but my point is : the price is waaay too high. Metal Gear Rising may not have the same obviously with the VR-missions, even tho' it does come rly close, but that was just an example. A very small part of that game with the same price (including the story dlcs!) is smth with a rly similar concept. People should buy that game instead, in my opinion it's much better and it's one of my favourite games, as well as for maaany other people.I do recommend Streamline to a few people tho', and it's obvious that the game was made for such people, Twitch streamers that stream almost daily, and kids. And maybe SJWs if you look at the girly customization of the guy x) I don't rly like that fact either personally, but that's not what I wanted to talk about with this. But even for those people, wait for a sale :/ There are sooo many better games out there, for the same or a lower price even! =D			"

17/11/2016For those people who complain about creating a twitch account, i dont see nobody complaining about creating one on World of Tanks.The game is pretty nice, but needs more modes. Geting it free is worth it, trust me, but 20 euros i think its a litle bit excesive for a game just for streaming. For the ones that didnt got it free, wait, actually its not recommended.I'll keep updating this review.			"

								The shor two days that i have played this game have been the funnest ones i've had to date  Because you can play with twitch broadcasters and people from there chat. and it only takes minuets to pick up the game, because constantly you are explaining the rules to people who come across the game and say ""What am I watching"" and this and you say ""its called Streamline you collect points and run from the hunter"" iand if you get hit by the hunter you will become a ghost who can still earn points from players who hace a ghost above there heads and the screen says Haunt Target and there name. when it comes to watching the audiance who are not in the game can still troll the players by voting on rules and playing bingo on  www.streamote/broadcaster and it even works on you phone browser.

Early Access Review
								   ""Get the ball into the goal"" is too simple a premise for you to call it an orginal game. There's plenty of games that do that, but there are usually complexities that make the game interesting and fun otherwise; adding new elements, tight mechanics, or complex rules. This game fails in all of those regards. It lacks anything that makes a game interesting.    It's art style is colorful in a way that seems almost sterile, like a test pattern. None of the pick-ups seem to do anything, they have numbers on them so I assume they're money, but what for? Your characters appearance? There aren't any skill trees or anything, so I really can't see what collecting these little tokens is even good for.    The animations are clunky and the controls seem unresponsive because of it, making you feel like you need to wait for an animation to be done to give your character a command. The goal of the game seems to be just to run around. I'm being literal there, and not overly reductive; there doesn't seem to be any incentive to get the ball into the goal so most players just seem to run around and parkour the tiny levels.   I want to separate this paragraph, and note that my feelings on the SJW-ness of this game did not influence my feelings on the quality of the game itself too greatly. It's a crappy game despite that. That said, the world built in this game (what little world was built) is so overtly preachy in it's left-ness that it almost seems like the only reason the developers made it in the first place.    The blurb that the creators came up with on the Steam page reads like an seventh grade girl trying to make up a sport that will still let her eat cake and daydream about horses. That's a bit of a stretch maybe, but it just reeks of  immature ""no Boys allowed"" type garbage.    Then there's the fact that the character that everyone starts out with is a black woman, in a sassy pose, and a wide smirk on her face. The only thing that doesn't bother me is the fact that it's a black woman. What does bother me is the smirk and defiant pose. It's like the developers are saying ""Yeah, this black woman is the default and there's nothing you can do about it, you racist!"" when there wasn't anyone saying otherwise in the first place. To me, staunch defiance in the face of zero opposition is just as cowardly as fleeing or shrinking from opposition.   Then instead of ""gender"" there's just a ""body type"" option, which changes you from looking feminine to looking masculine. Again, nothing inherently wrong with a gender neutral game, but making it seem like you've done everyone a favor is obnoxious.    My main problem with all stuff like this is how cheap it all is when you look at it as a whole. When I was a kid my parents were SUPER CHRISTIAN, and they would only buy Christian music and watch Christian movies and buy Christian postage stamps or whatever. At around the age of eleven or so I began to notice that if you didn't look so hard at the message the thing was trying to shove down your throat, you were left with a production so sub-par that really kind of insulted the audience with how bad it was. Stuff that caters to SJWs is the same thing to me. It's preachy and annoying, and when you look more closely you realize that it's cheap and crappy too.			"

 Twitch no longer required to play the game Play With or Without twitch, after its latest update they've added a new gamemode and the not necessary twitch log in thing now :DBut sadly...The game feels dead, there's nobody to play with, which is a shame the game has a good concept, i love the graphics, the customization, it lacks stuff but still the game is pretty good to be dead, it feels more like a free to play game than a pay to play too but if it had more content and more players, i'd definetely recommend it...don't get this game if you're expecting to find matches unless you get some friends to play with...---> I'LL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I FIND PLAYABLE MATCHES AGAIN <---			"

								EDIT on 23.01.2017: GAME IS DEAD.I don´t mind the twitch-force. Game mechanics could be more distinct. I can only dodge by clicking q or e twice. The character and enemies don´t seem distinct enough. And who hits whom first seems quite arbitrary...as if one has to play this game a lot in order to figure out the glitch which makes you hit the enemy before the enemy hits you. It doesn´t have that ""plastic"" feeling which would be awesome for this game. The reason for this is the visual fuzziness and the audio isn´t very elaborated, too. They try to cover the lack of sounds with the soundtrack constantly playing. This could become a competitive game (if they listen to me, hehe) or another dead multiplayer on Steam.			"

								Many of the reviews go on about how hard it is to party with friends but I experienced little difficulty. The game is fast-paced  ,simple and is insanely colourful making it fun and easy to learn. Even from Australia the online play (hosted in europe/us) is easily playable and lobbies seem to be quick to find. I recommend playing with a group of 5+ friends as it keeps the game fast but not clustered.If you are unsure about buying the game you should wait till further updates with added features come out, then make your decision			"

								Now that I got help from the amazing player support team, I can play the game now. This game is really fun and addictive. At first I had low expectations for the game, but I was totally wrong and this game is defintely worth playing.			"

Early Access Review
								I got this game back when it was in closed alpha and played it a bit, then went and forgot about it. I recently just picked it up again, and it's a blast. Basically, depending on the mode, it can be described like this: Multiplayer Mirror's edge where you have to avoid one guy who wants to murder you, Multiplayer Mirror's edge where you're playing basketball/soccer, or multiplayer Mirror's edge while you're playing tag.Now it's not perfect. The movement needs tuning since it feels sloppy in a lot of cases, and takes a while getting used to. Additionally the game doesn't really take balance into account. This isn't a problem in the free for all modes, but in the ""bitball"" mode (the one that's like soccer/basketball), there are two teams and it's up to the host to balance it manually. This can lead to wildly unbalanced bitball games.The last downside to the game is it currently has a very low playerbase. However, the developers run streams of the game several days a week, with a bunch of people joining in. I recommend people join the discord and watch for alerts on the stream announcement channel.Now the last question, is it worth $20? Well, probably not. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing game, but the amount of variety it has right now isn't worth it. However if the devs succeed in fulfilling their promises of new modes, it will likely be worth $20 easily. From what I've seen so far, the devs look like they'll be able to do that, but you'll have to judge for yourself whether it's worth the risk.			"

								This game is just fun. It's got bright colors, parkour moves and whacking your friends with a stop sign..... what more can you ask for.  The Streamote feature adds another layer for your veiwers, if you are a Streamer, BUT you don't have to stream to enjoy this game.  Anyone can host a game and bring in friends or make it public and play with anyone. If you're looking for a game to just have fun with, this is a good choice.			"

								I got the game for free, so I can't judge if it's worth the cost, but this game is quite fun.It's essentially a competitive multiplayer Pac-Man with crazy mobility options. Random effects also activate to make things crazier. Some of these effects can be annoying, but the more annoying ones usually last a shorter amount of time so it's not too bad.There's still a bit of room for improvement but the game is in Early Access so I trust the devs will fix most of the issues I have.

Early Access Review
								A pretty fun and simple game, but its definitely not worth of 20€. And they are even talking about rising price after the EA is done. In my opinion, games like this should be free-to-play or at least for 5 or so € if they want an active playerbase. There are already cosmetic drops that they can make some money from. Without a lower price tag the game will slowly die and without the last weeks  giveaway (18.11.) nobody would play it already.			"

								I've tried the game and have to say it's totally awesome. Better to play on open stream with some people and a streamer to have more fun, but you can play alone and join some random matches or even make your own stream too. :) If you like the style, to kill people in an area without weapons and blood, and have fun, it's your game. :)			"

								If you like running, jumping, and tagging people, then Streamline is for you.It's a very colourful game.Not exactly my cup of tea, but it was ok to play for a short while.(I had a go of it when it was available to play for free temporarily.)Mind you, it crashed about every second game I played - but only once during gameplay; mostly it crashed after the game was over (the game would hang), and sometimes when joining a game. On quite a few occasions I had to Ctrl-Alt-Delete to end the programme, and then restart it.Note: You have to create an account with Twitch.tv to play the game (unless you already have one).5.5/10.

								It's not there yet, but this game has potential.The concept is nice, but rather than stream-related stuff, the developer should be focus on refining the game instead.Anyway, it's not a bad game for killing time and you're not in the mood to play a long session.			"

								Very good game, love it beacuse it uses Twitch. Love the Steamote system too, you can vote for power ups etc, you can buy perks for all the 3 rounds. Sometimes this game is full, sometimes it's empty. ANW, 10/10 WOULD LINE AGAIN !			"

								The game is really good. A game of cat and mouse with a little mixture of parkour. The only problem, you can only play if you have a Twitch account. The game is still under development but aside from that it's really funny to play.Update: 19/12/2016You no longer need a Twitch account to play and you can use your Steam name. With that problem fixed, the game as no more problems to me.			"

								I got the game for free, so I can't judge if it's worth the cost, but this game is quite fun.It's essentially a competitive multiplayer Pac-Man with crazy mobility options. Random effects also activate to make things crazier. Some of these effects can be annoying, but the more annoying ones usually last a shorter amount of time so it's not too bad.There's still a bit of room for improvement but the game is in Early Access so I trust the devs will fix most of the issues I have.

								This game is just fun. It's got bright colors, parkour moves and whacking your friends with a stop sign..... what more can you ask for.  The Streamote feature adds another layer for your veiwers, if you are a Streamer, BUT you don't have to stream to enjoy this game.  Anyone can host a game and bring in friends or make it public and play with anyone. If you're looking for a game to just have fun with, this is a good choice.			"
