								This game is a lot of fun for the price, but there are a few things I would like to see improved.-More customizable point limits: With powerups off, 1000 ends too quickly and 5000 takes ages.-Better powerups: I love the powerups, but they don't last long enough to feel like they made a huge impact.- 4 PLAYER VS: It would be awesome.Overall, I'm happy with the game. I can't wait to see what happens once it's out ofearly access.			"

								Reminder of how much I suck at bullet hells and pong simulator 2016.No but seriously, this game manages to well-adhere a few genres into what seems like from an outside perspective, a game of pong. This game takes a lot of skill in bullet hell style titles to get used to, but damn is it fun. My only complaint is that there isn't an easier AI difficulty for babies such as myself. Everything else is well polished, and as for the price, you can beat it. The soundtrack as well! I wish it was included as a DLC, I would have for sure bought that.Overall, I'd say this game is definitely worth buying. If you choose not to, then enjoy the half eaten bag of chips you managed to buy from a smelly corner store with the money you didn't spend on this.Just buy it.			"

								The game is nice with the feel of retro game back in 80s. I recieved it from the developers via gamingonlinux.com. Runs well on my Acer laptop Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  The issue that I encountered here is missing exectable after due it is not on Windows OS. Only thing I did to install it properly on Linux is to Change it to beta Linux in properties to enable to install it. Promising game and I love multiplayer style.			"

								This is a great fun little game, cheap too!I've played it with versus few of my friends and we've had a few laughs whilst playing it.I mean it's obviously still in early access so there's room for improvement but the updates so far made some nice tweaks and changes.Not bad at all for the price of a chocolate bar these days!

								Only played a little but..So far, it's a great little game. Just on single player, its fun and weirdly addictive.Quite difficulty too, even at the medium setting.Haven't tried local multipalyer yet, need to find a friend so i can invite them round for a game.(no online multiplayer unfortunately, hopefully that will come later) Would definitely recommend, especially for the price.

								Based on the current early access, the Impossiball is a cheapest arkanodic game. The game and that mechanism is simple and fun. I think this game is suitable for multi-play with your friends.Maybe we can't expect improve graphic-I think the GUIs is possible by the devs- assets, but we can hope improve the challenging features with the Steam achievements and leaderboards, and some funny effects in the future.How many balls you can control?

								There are too many good things to say about this game, so let me just give a run-down on the options-Players- I couldn't test this out, because I don't have any friends, however I take it that there is some form of multiplayer aspect to this game (?)-Difficulty- Pretty much what you would expect, easy medium and hard. The only complaint I have, actually, is it is really hard. While it is Impossiball, or Impossible if you didn't get the name for some reason, I can't even get past easy and I have been playing this for around 20 minutes now.-Powerups- If one of the many, many, MANY of your balls (or opponents) hits a powerup, you have an effect put on your character. I have seen effects like invisible balls, shields, big character things, small character things, and inverted controls, however I am sure there are a few I am missing.-Score Target- The easiest way to put it is how long the game will last. For example, if you put it at 10000, the game will last until one of the players reach a score one 10000. 1000= shortest time while 20000= longest time.-Camera- Personally my favorite part of the game. You can have it in a classic 2d mode, a 3d 1st person mode, or 3d third person mode. My favorite is the 3d 3rd person mode, but that is just my opinion.Music isn't a setting, but I just want to throw in that the soundtrack is amazing, and if it was added as DLC I would buy it.In conclusion, it is easily the best dollar game I have bought. It is challenging, fun, and addictive, exactly what every game needs.			"
