												It's nice if you just want to make contact with a baseball, but the physics make the ball so jumpy. Just tapping it could send it over the fence. I'm not very fond of this take on it.			"

												It's pretty fun from what I've played so far! It does feel like the ball hitting physics are accurate. It's worth a buy.			"

												I played the heck out of the demo, so of course I had to buy the full version. As it was in the demo, Pitch Hit is intuitive, simple, and fun. I could show this game to a non-gamer who hasn't tried VR yet, and they could get the hang of it easily.There isn't a ton of content as of now, but this is the kind of game that I'll come back to every so often for 10 or 15 minutes  to get my VR baseball fix. My favorite mode is definitely playing catch with myself, which is way more fun than I thought it would be.			"

												Brings me right back to 10 years ago playing Wii Baseball on my 32cm TV in my bedroom at my parent's house. Fun little batting sim with great physics and batting mechanics. Feels great when you nail a ball sweetly. Very realistic.Could use some basic settings such as the ability to turn off the music and to move the hitting position. Would rather it to the side than the center to give more swinging room, I'm always afraid I'm going to hit something. Having to the squeeze the grip to hold the bat constantly tires out my hand somewhat too.Other than that, fun little game and shows the potential for a full baseball game in the future.			"

												I've enjoyed the game for the limited time I've played it. One thing that I think needs improvement is messaging about what your goal is for each level. Currently you have to try to select the next unplayed level to find out what you need to do in the previous one. When it came to the Juggle level I had no idea what to do. I probably spent 10 minutes throwing balls, hitting balls without any idea what I had to do to complete the level. Finally, I accidentally hit a ball twice and realized you had to keep the ball in the air by hitting it with your bat over and over. Overall, it's a fun experience with good physics.			"

												Ok.  This game scratches an itch that is needed in VR right now: swinging a club at a ball.  That alone makes it worth purchasing. With that said, there are a number of things that need to be fixed and changed in order for it to stay relevant in the future.  #1:  for the love of God, add an option to disable the music.  should be extremely simple to add.#2: definitely harder than the first: add an option for fastball pitcher instead of eephus pitcher.  #3: hardest of all: fix the jumps that pitched balls have.  sometimes it's like watching a flipbook because the ball just stops in mid air and jumps ahead.  I have pretty much the best system that money can buy right now, so it ain't my computer.  #4: home run derby.  duh.  Please, please, PLEASE add a music toggle before I go insane.  Oh, and get a sweat band or something for this game.  You will sweat a ton, and if any sweat gets into your vive, it will fry.  This game made me so sweaty the first time I played it, that I had to RMA my first Vive.  True story.  Sweat damage is dumb but it happens; be careful and take breaks.			"

												Shows you what sports games are going to be like in the future -- and these guys did it first!Fan since the demo -- great physics, and simply a lot of fun to hit baseballs around all over the place. Devs communicate with their users as well!I hope to see more add-ons to it as well. Great ideas so far.Much like Hoops VR (Basketball), it's something I think every Vive owner should try, esp for $10.			"

												I purchased Pitch-Hit baseball and instantly loved it,  I am a big baseball fan but that aside the game is just really fun. It forces you to get some high scores before moving onto the next mini game which is great. The best part of the game is just hitting the ball and then catching it moments later, actually very smooth and intuitive. Will be trying to take down all the high scores over the next few weeks.

												I enjoyed this game. The best feature was being able to hit a ball and then catch it yourself, that experience was really cool and intuitive and I hope it is expanded upon more in future releases.I am glad the hoops games difficulty was fixed, so now I have no complaints about the game. A pretty fun demo that seems incomplete, but hopefully more content and polish will be added in the future.Perhaps not something I would be willing to pay the full price for (I received the game for free for testing) but if you are a big sports fan I could see the purchase being worth it.

												If you're a VR enthusiast and baseball fan, this is a must have.  Tons of fun, especially hitting pop ups and then fielding them.  The UI could use some work as I've found that the option buttons are way too close and I keep hitting them on accident.  Could use some more updates/modes as well, but as it stands now at this price, it's definitely worth it.			"

												PROS: This is sweet.  Exactly what I wanted.  Batting cage VR simulator with fun game modes thrown in.CONS: I like to play with only one controller for a more natural baseball swing.  This works fine, BUT between rounds the game can't seem to remember which controller is the bat.  I'm constantly having to go pick up my second controller and swap it out.			"
