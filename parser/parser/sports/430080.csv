												Another day, another indie game biting the dust.3/10+Interesting stat system and short or long game modes with a small game package allows for quick rounds+Stat progression and arena progression always plusses in management games+Who doesn't enjoy gambling and winning?-Archaic, invisible, and head-scratching paper-rock-scissors outcomes devoid of correlation to stats or attack decisions.-Potentially interesting but ultimately useless bye-week activities for your non-active roster-Smallest scale imaginable for a management gameLong-story short: Unless they release a lot of extra content, I wouldn't recommend this game.Long-story:The main issue I have with this game is that you start off with 3 warriors (no indication that your team ever grows after completing a season and reaching the finals) and try to raise them into legitimate warriors.  These guys have a robust stat system of Strength, Agility, Speed (? redundant?), Intellect, and Durability, with stats ranging to 100 and age is a factor.  But herein lies the problem.  None of these stats seem to matter. There is almost no correlation of stats and attack choices to damage done or received.And with stats out of 100 (maybe more? but not naturally), and seasons at 20 days max, training and ambiguous 'soul quests' were largely tacked-on things to do with your inactive roster (of 2 gladiators that are generally needing to rest by the end of the season anyway).Graphics and audio, good god.... I felt like I was playing Baldur's Gate using only Open Source elements.  If you play this, listen for the sound of someone biting an apple when a hit connects. (This sounds like a joke, it's not.) This game had a lot of promise, potentially being a unique take on games like Football Manager or Franchise mode of popular sports game but fell tragically short.  In case a dev sees this, I would totally revisit with the following additional elements:Meaningful stat increases, both for gladiators and the arena. Money and attendance are the only benefits I could tell of upgrading, but attendance only increases money, and money can easily be generated by making decent conservative bets season-round.  Favor, gained from victory, only increases money and attendance.  Training costs money, but even maximum training only cost me something like 250g per gladiator and a victory generally nets me 3x that. (3 of course being how many gladiators you can have anyway). Meaningful arena upgrades.  I love the idea of unique upgrades a la lemonade stand or even dinopark tycoon.  Let me upgrade the chariot parking lot, or invest in armored lions (btw, these ♥♥♥♥♥ showed up randomly in a fight and did 30% damage to my warrior who was already being curb-stomped by the enemy despite a 2:1 stat ratio in my favor), how about some leg of lamb seasonings for more attendees?  Stat increases should be significant.  Gaining 1 or 2 stats per day while training at all is useless in a 20 day season, especially given how they seem to be awarded every other day in random areas? (Plus...:Stats don't seem to do a thing.  Strength seems to be a roll of the dice where the dice don't change despite significant stat differences.  I understand needing to keep a game of fighting management semi-random, but the unknown only seemed to leave me scratching my head.  Even using attacks that play to my strengths seemed to let my opponent urinate on my gladiator for 20 damage.Larger roster.  Without a larger roster, why even bother training?  I can likely hire a new gladiator with my uesless heaps of gold that is better than my current roster rather than spending half their life training at a snail's pace.Equipment.  Equipment would be an excellent gold sink, requiring upkeep, training, and a staff...I WANT A STAFF! How about providing a staff of people?  The game even compares itself to baseball, why do I not have a ""coaching staff"" of a blacksmith, nurses, marketing, and construction?  You could do some amazing things with these.  Upgrade your forge, your hospital, your construction and equipment, and upgrades and research take weeks out of the season.  You could pay for better smelting techniques and better staff in general, but you have to upgrade your arena to have room for them.Favor could be used to petition the gods for better victory, healing, or research. Lastly, bribes are so useless.  I bribed so many matches and lost almost all of them despite a bribe making victory ""much more likely.""  What a crock.This game leaves way too much to be desired.  An extremely interesting premise but what is ultimately less interesting than the colisseums of Caesar 3.  Spend some more time at the drawing board and release some free content that adds some actual management rather than pure RNG, especially if you're going to boast stats and upgrades.			"

												*key provided by developer for review purposes*O.O.T.C. 16...Out of the Coliseum 16 (BCE)First off, let's get the genre question out of the way.  Elysium Blood Games (EBG) is not an RPG (though it uses RPG elements), nor is it a fighting game (though fighting is the central activity of the game).  As I hope you gathered from my cheeky header, EBG is in fact a sports management simulator.  It has much more in common with OOTP or FHM than it does with, say, Pillars of Eternity. Or with Skullgirls.  EBG is a lite sports managmement sim that is complex enough to be engaging, but casual enough to fit in that perfect ""lunchbreak"" game niche.There. Trust me, you will enjoy the game much more if you know what you are getting into up front.  If you don't enjoy manager sims or casual games, you might want to think twice before purchasing so that you don't end up posting a thumbs-down review dripping with haterade the game doesn't deserve.Bread & Circuses: the Citizen's Schadenfreude...and a golden opportunity for an entrepeneurial gladiator stabler!The madness and decadence of ""the Empire Before the Fall"" is a well-known trope to scholars of history, and one that shows up often in video games.  It's an insane moment, during which the masses feel themselves lifted above foreigners and criminals, because the masses witness the bloody spectacle but need never fear they might end up in the ring themselves.  It's gluttunous and irrational, to take joy in another's suffering. But it became a tightly protected ""right."" Seneca the Elder observes that ""the populace, defending its own iniquity, pits itself against reason."" And so here we are to make our fortune by facilitating acts of brutish violence.  Gameplay is divided into seasons, and each season is divided into day-long turns.  As the manager, you get one stat point to distribute among your manager attributes at the beginning of each season.  These stats have global effects.  Then it's on to the stables. The gladiator population is randomly generated, so names, quirks, portraits, and stats will be different every game.  The fighters' attributes are of a type that will be familiar to sports management fans, including the ever-important ""potential"" attribute.  At any given time you may have 3 gladiators in your stable.  One gladiator must be designated as the fighter for the day's match.  For the other two, you can pay for them to train up attributes, or you may send them on a ""soul quest."" The choice of quests are each a generated combination of three numbers: risk, reward, and time commitment.  They will usually take several days but your fighter will return with some cash and often some improved stats. Or they will get horribly injured or die.You can also use cash to purchase or repair weapons for your fighters, upgrade your stables with permanent buffs, upgrade the stadium to seat more people, bribe an opposing gladiator, or, my personal favorite, place bets on the day's posted matches.  The stadium provides odds for each bracket and you can bet 100, 250, or 500 on each match (or zero if you're not the betting type).  The game's secondary currency is influence, which you may use to publicize your fights in hopes to increase attendance and payout.  More importantly, you can use it to purchase randomly generated stable-wide buffs that last for a specified number of turns.  There are so many different combinations of these it makes for great fun.Now that all your stable business is concluded, it's time to fight! The fight is turn-based and you may recommend a technique each turn or you can give a general recommendation for the match and watch it play out.  These fights are heavy on the RNG, but instead of walls of math, each turn generates a blow-by-blow narrative of the fight.  It's a really nicely done feature.  I asked the dev about the lack of explicit math and they said that this technique encourages immersion and discourages min-maxers.  Though I sometimes like to see a game's math-guts, I do in general agree with them.  Certainly it was the right choice for this game.This goes on until the season has been played out.  If you've done well, one of your fighters might get to fight in championship rounds for big rewards.  Between seasons you get to use your stat point, and then try to get the fighters you want to keep to stay with you by flashing money under their noses.  Fighters who have had a particularly rough season or who feel they've outgrown your enterprise will refuse to negotiate and just leave your service.Then it all begins again! I have found that one season, depending on how many days you've optioned for it to be, lasts between twenty minutes and an hour, making EBG an excellent game to hop on when you only have a short time and still have a satisfying experience.7/10-recommended for fans of sports management sims, gladiatorial combat, lunchbreak games, or bread & circuses in general.  Also, the pricepoint is fantastic for the amount of play you can get out of it. No Drama, Just Reviews  "

												This is a game that fails its great concept. You are put in charge of a ludus and must develop your gladiators to become the greatest dominus in Rome. Fantastic concept. But the execution leaves much to be desired in virtually every arena (heh).For starters, the RNG in this game is ridiculous. Your fighters will range from 4-8 feet with no weighting given any expected norms. The gladiator's weight is just as variable. Not that this affects the fighting, near as I can tell, but it is a prominent example of how insane the RNG can be.The weapons are INSANELY expensive. You can afford one at the start and they are tied to whomever you give it to. Even if they die, they keep their weapon. So if your main guy dies, you are borked. None of your development options really seem to help because the RNG is so wacky that you can send a very strong, well developed gladiator against a very weak foe and still hve your man on the slab at the end.It's just not a satisfying game. Plenty of frustration but none of the stuff you have to go though to get a guy built up is rewarding.Don't get me started on the character portraits. They are bad. Most of them have your guys looking like total putzes. Thumb's down for me.			"

												Okay, so there are things that need tweaking but now that I have played a little more and actually talked to the developer, this gets a positive review. It is hard these days to even get feedback from a developer but this one goes out of his way to make sure people are happy and heard. I have faith the game will be balanced and tweaked to satisfaction in the future.This game actually gets kind of addicting after a while, give it a few seasons, they don't take very long.My old review (which still holds relevance): At first this was a very novel idea and something I would be highly interested in. I love management games. I am finding that having an extremely good fighter who is much better than your oppoenet matters very little more often that it probably should. I am also finding that you do not have very much influence over the development of your fighters, it is pretty much random. This game feels a lot like you have very little control over what is happening at all. It is a great concept, it just needs more ability to actually control the development of your fighters.			"

												Considering you can get the game for a couple cents on a couple sites I guess it isn't bad. I've played it for a couple hours and I enjoyed it enough to continue playing at least. I however soon found myself bored and after finishing only 4 seasons was beginning to win multiple titles and felt like I had beaten the game already. At this point the game is unbalanced and I doubt this will be fixed long term given that the game is not exactly a new game. If you can pick up the game for a couple cents and have nothing better to do by all means go for it, but otherwise spending those half dozen hours playing any other game would probably serve the same purpose.

												Simplistic text-based Gladiator Management sim. Indepth enough to keep you entertained for a few hours yet casual enough that you'll be able to pick it up and just start playing. While it's definitely lacking on the aesthetic side of things, the music and writing is more than enough to make up for the graphical animations. Personally, I wish they would've delved a bit more into the equipment side of things, maybe given more weapons or changed the effects that weapons could have on a Gladiator's effectiveness in combat. For example, a giant 2-handed hammer would probably slow down your gladiator but his attacks would be downright nasty. In a short and sweet note, this is definitely something that text-based gamers will enjoy but also those who are fans of management style games can find something to like. Pros:-Very helpful tooltips althrough the game's screens that explain everything indepth yet don't clutter the screen.-Love the writing, simplistic but it gives a great visual-Music, although loops, is downright soothing-Simple but fun text-based managementCons:-Very limited Aesthetics throughout the game-Limited equipment selection, most customization for fighters comes from their stats. -Sometimes you feel like you get cheated by the RNG but the game can be forgiving-Feels like you've done everything after a few hours of playGameplay Footage:

												Ah, this game brings back memories of the PBM (play by mail/email) games I used to play back in the 90's and early 2000's. Good old arena combat! I could probably do with a bit more text detail of the fights, a homage to the rich text detail of the play by mail games, but it's still fun none-the-less. If you're looking for a graphical game, this isn't it, though the artwork used in the game isn't bad.  The creator of the game keeps updating it regularly which let's me know he is still striving to upgrade the game and make it even better even though it's already a finished product. It is addictive, you always want to see how well your main gladiator will do against the next opponent, and maybe cringe if you're fighting one of the best... though you could always try to bribe them to lose if the option is available for that particular opponent. Even bribed opponents may still win, then you'll be out both gold and a win, double whammy. Opponents (and your own) can be injured, even killed. And carry reputations per se, though I'm unsure how that aspect of the game works, your gladiators can become embroiled in scandals, but have a skill which can reduce (or eliminate?) these chances. Maybe your main gladiator is 8 and 0, with an easy opponent coming up, then blam, suspended for misconduct for 6 matches.  *Edit - Forgot to mention there is also questing, to try and improve stats and gain gold. And also training for improving stats. So basically you have three gladiators at any given time. One is your main gladiator fighting in the games, a second one will be training, usually your alternate for gladiator combat, and one will be adventuring on a quest. And through it all, you have to manage your stamina (and injuries, and the rare death). Overall, this game fills that void for gladiatorial combat. I love it, and didn't hesitate to buy it after checking it out. And it's a steal at only $5 I believe? ~Lawler			"

												If you like management sims, Roman style genres/history & aren't fussed about graphics, there's lots to like about this game.Quite a straightforward concept: You have 3 fighters, choose your best one, stick him in the ring & hopefully watch him win. Train the other two, or send them on quests for random rewards (either gold or improvement to their stats, or both), wait for your best fighter to get knackered or injured (or killed, if unlucky), then choose your next best one to fight for you. At the end of the season, if you've won enough fights, you go into a playoff to hopefully win the tournament, then do it all over again next year, by which time your youngsters will have ranked up due to experience, or your veterans may have declined.Certain power ups help you out - weapons, upgrades, individual fighter traits, bribes or potions.Decision-making matters to some degree, but you don't necessarily have to go through painstaking thought-processes about every tiny detail.Pro's:--Satisfying to watch your 18 year old prodige become a real man-Very good value for money-unpredictable (though some might say this is a con)-enough decisions to make to keep it interesting for a while, but perhaps not enough for a full 20 season campaign (although the developer has suggested that other stuff might get added to keep it interesting for longer)Cons:--Results can feel a bit random: Even when an opponent is bribed, injured, worse than your man, even when your man is pumped on steriods (well, potions), you will often still get beaten-A bit buggy: Have had saves just crash straight after loading (although the developer has fixed one within half an hour of me raising the issue)-No graphics, but I have a dinosaur PC, so this is a good thing for me because I can actually run it-As mentioned in pro's, not sure I could complete en entire 20 season stint, unless more is addedWould definitely recommend.

												A simple yet fun-filled game that proves stats aren't everything, someone with poor stats could win against someone who has higher stats. Just shows a bit of realism and doesn't give off that ""Oh, it's obvious who's going to win"" feeling. There are many features that make Elysium: Blood Games enjoyable, from managing your warriors, training them, sending them on quests, to betting on other matches as well as influence and earning gold. I also thoroughly enjoy the soundtracks as they do compliment the game very well. It's a great game to play when you get tired of the normal FPS and RPG gameplay and just want to sit down and play something more casual and relaxing, although it's not always relaxing, I sometimes scream at my warrior (ahem... my screen... ahem) because I expected a win but instead he brings me a defeat. But that's the beauty of the game. If I were to have a complaint about this game, it would probably be the lack of a tutorial, considering it's start new campaign and off you go. The avatars of some warriors are are ugly, and they're all bold/bare-headed. If they're warriors then I'd expect them to be wearing helmets or other pieces of armour, which is also not evident within the game. While you can give them a weapon, it would be nice if you could also give them some armour. As well as some of the timings of the various unfortunate events... The day before the semi-finals my main fighter decided to steal illegal weapons and he got caught, therefore suspending him for 7-10 days and putting him out of the season.Despite the stuff mentioned above. I really do recommend this game, kudos for the developer for making us such an enjoyable game. While it has been 2.5 months since the release of Elysium: Blood Games (at the time of me writing this) I really do see more room for ideas and features for this game. A solid game that I will continue to play. (2hours of play time as of writing this review)			"

												For the money this is being sold at it is a 'good casual game' if you have an interest in Gladiator combat, a sadly lacking area in gaming.  Also, the developer is actively supporting the community by interacting with gamers, noting improvements and providing these where they make sense (e.g. Weapons were a welcome addition).  This is an attribute to be supportive of, as some developers will leave gamers with poorly finished products or not engage the paying customers.The game: You are the 'manager' of a group of gladiators, and have to prepare them for fights, choose who fights and instruct them how they will fight (defensively, normally, or aggressively, or try for specific attacks to make the opponent bleed).  The fights are text based, and the interface is primarly text and statistical  based.  If you like very strong graphics or controlling characters in first person, this is NOT the game for you.  This IS the game if you like 'simulated management' of the gladiators only, where you choose actions on a turn by turn basis, in what is quite a basic interface but cleanly developed (and hence the price because it is quite basic and casual, yet easy to learn and a little addictive).Positives:Beautiful intro with nice opening graphic and strong music.You split your managerial skills between Loyalty, Performance, Development and Healing, and are assigned with a selection of Gladiators, making for a uniuqe team each game.If your gladiator is not in combat, you can send them to training or on a quest to imrpove their skills (but you dont get to do any other action while they participate in these events or see what they actually do in great detail).Choose who will fight each battle, they will participate in a league of gladiators. If you choose to try and play dirty you can bribe your opponent to fight worse, or, buy special brews for your gladiators.A nice side game is a betting game, where you place money on other matches on who will win, based on their statistics.You can upgrade an arena if you achieve certain levels, get bonuses for winning certain levels, and advertise to increase attendance and revenue at the arena.  Sometimes there's a chance the 'king' may attend your fight.Some random events can occur in battles, e.g. lions may appear once a season or so.Tip : -  Be sure to use the ? help button on each screen on first playthrough and read carefully to understand the game and mechanics. -  The first battle was over so quickly I wondered what was going on as the text appeared far too quickly.  So I went to the settings and changed the settings so that a manual pogression of text was required, a much slower and enjoyable experience.  Development required:Needs steam achievements.Hope to see more overall improvements and features to improve the depth of the game.  One idea, possibly armour? Switchable equipment.  I wondered what period this was actually trying to replicate, then I realised it's more of a 'fantasy setting' gladiator combat game, and doesn't really reference histroy with historical accurateness.  If you don't mind this, you can overlook this fact and focus on the gameplay, as the designer wanted to focus on the game of fighting more than the history I believe. "

												Elyseum: Blood games is a text based gladiator managemet game developed by SimProse Studios. In the game you are the arena master and you are given management over 3 gladiators. You can have a primary gladiator set for fights which can be changed at any time, and train/sent to missions the other two. The season lenght can be chosen at the begining of the game from three given days:10, 15, 20. At the end of each tournament you are given the opportunity to extend the contract of gladiators(they can also decline it) or just fire them to hire others. There are various buffs/weapons which can be used to raise your chances of victories. For some random matches there is a reward for the winner.The game lacks the details of the menu tabs. The game menu have a total of six tabs, 3 on each side. The ones on left are Warrior Barracks where you can manage your warriors, Back Alleyway where you can buy buffs, Praetor's Library as the ussualy settings tab. The ones on the right are Arenamaster's Basilica where you have another 5 tabs which are explained if you hover over them, Local Tavern Notices where you can raise your spectators numbers and the revenue for the matches, Town Meeting Hall where you can see the curent standings and attributes of the gladiators from the curent season. Even though some explanations lack with some playtime you will get familiar with the concept.The battles are random, and bribing and the equipment slightly raises your chances of victory(doesn't guarantee it). This could be seen as advantage of disadvange, advantage if you don't invest in the other functions and you win and disadvange if you lose after you have invested in them. During battles there is a chance of injury(don't know how it works, in my 5 played seasons never sustained an injury) and death chance where you lose your gladiator.What I especially liked was the sound. The cheers when the battle starts, blocking and moving(as in dodging) sounds as the hurtful yelling after you have been hit greatly enhances the game atmosphere.If you are interested in this fact, the game features trading cards, but lacks achievements.Note - This game was reviewed using a key provided by the developer.

												+ It's an easy-to-get-into sport simulation, which involves a little strategy (defensive for me).+ Almost every page of the menu got its little ""i"" somewhere on it, so you can get further information.+ Little side-goals, which bring quite some boost (beeing gold, influence, league points or even stats!).+/- There is randomness in this game -- you can beat gladiators with much better stats than yours, but on the other hand you - ofc - can loose against weaker ones.Also, your fighter can just drop dead if you're abusing brews too often.+/- Since it's easy-to-get-into it lacks the depths of MoO3, CK2 or EU4... but it wouldn't be casual then either ;)- After 12 seasons and the same amount of successful championships, I start to run out on goals (having achieved the biggest possible arena. almost 340k gold and a reserve of over 120 influence-pts, there's not much to go for).Once I get 1 or 2 of my fighters to (near) stat-cap, I will be w/o goals and can only hope something new will be added by then. Some kind of online-highscore after 10 seasons or such would be nice.++ Developers are quick to respond to questions and react to improvement-suggestions - so I can still hope some add-ons are to come to give me new goals.Last, but not least, I've gotta say that this game SCREAMS for a multiplayer option (w/o saving then naturally) - wouldn't it be fun to battle other players?!?So, overall, I paid much more for much less time of fun and can fully recommend this lil gem of a game!

												Elysium: Blood Games is an enjoyable casual strategy game about gladiators. Don't expect something complex, 'cause the game is simple and easy to play, and from my point of view, this is a very good thing. You can fight, train your gladiator or send him on a quest. What else do you need? Not much... Customization could improve a bit, since it's kinda basic at the moment, and some nice add-ons for the gladiators, like different items and weapons, would make the game even better. I'm giving this game a positive feedback 'cause I'm sure it will improve even more; the developer is very active, and he usually listen to what the community says, always triyng to fix and add things.P.S. Let's not forget about trading cards, they're really beautiful! "

Train them, send them on quests for glory and fame, fight them in the arena... and then scrape their remains off the floor because they're terrible and died...Quite a tough manager game, taking a decent amount of time to improve your gladiators and suffering many defeats before they're good enough to win often. Luckily everyone uses plastic swords since it's rare anyone actually dies on a loss.With some effort though you will prevail... You'll march up to Rome's gates, high five Hannibal on the way in, dance naked in the halls of the Senate and then slap Caesar in the face with your plastic swords!Quick SummaryPros:-Good progression-Interesting fights-Good commentary text of the fights-Super cheap-RNG allows for upsets, stats aren't everything-Equipment makes a large difference-Decent replayabilityCons:-The UI is very poor quality-Not much choice of gear-Hard to get into, not a clear tutorial-RNG can screw you pretty often			"

												i find this game fun and something you can put some hours into and progess and feel rewarded for it, i think some of the negative reviews come from not putting enough time into the game to discover all its features and the keys to making your gladiator a top fighter as at first it is hard and you will lose alot of matches but dont be put off or give up, it would be pointless to make a perfect winner at the start and nothing to aim for in the game so you need to earn some money by betting on matches to get your gladiator a weapon then you will begin to progress and win some matches and then for me the most fun starts in training hopefully a top fighter!this game is a gladiator management game thats text based so you wont see violent gory visual matches but there is detailed text of your gladiators attacks and damage to your opponent,it can get a bit dull after a season of reading all the attck/defence text i admit but it also displays the amount of damage you do or take so you can always just read that bit of it.a minor negative of the game would be the limited pictures of the fighters, they are just 3d headshots that are reused alot so i would have liked to see full views of the fighters instead but this doesnt affect gameplay in any way.the game is at a very affordable price so i would say its good value for what you get in return.to sum it all up this works and feels different to another gladiator management i love age of gladiators and while i dont find it addictive as that game it is something to keep you busy and entertained for a good number of hours so worth its price			"

												Inexpensive text gaming with some twists.Derek has created a slightly different version of his ""Imperium: Arena of Death"" to share over Steam.Text gaming, might not be for everyone, but his games are much more interactive than ""visual novels"" that you find here at higher prices. Is it worth the price to check it out?As its fresh from the programming press, the game portrays your personna as a Gladiator manager with 3 new recruits to start your roster.The combat is random, but influencing it is your pre-game descisions as well as your round by round tactical advice.Though the RNG is in play, managing your set of workers gives you a number of options besides fighting.You can bet on the other matches, use your gained influence to beef up the crowds, buy elixirs, send other workers on quests or exerscise regimes  to hopefully boost up stats.The battles play out in broadcasted play-by-play events. Though it may seem rinse-repeat activity and occasional bugs, Derek is continously working on this, adding updates and content. He seems to be willing to listen to his purchasers and try things out. There is a bit of cosmetic moddability capable with this game (which I hope he will open up more into the text banter itself). Derek has some clever ideas, give him a brilliant artist and storywriter and who knows where he could rocket into.I recommend this to support Derek's efforts, a stepping stone to greater things.Elysium isn't a game to consume Skyrim sized hours into it, nor the depth.It's a small priced gladiator management game in a fantasy world, something to kick the imagination in gear beween the ears.The interface takes a few tries to get used to before catching the flow of the game, there is a bit of improvement needed on visual clairity (there are popups to help)			"

												A fun management game that allows you to build up a stable of fighters to build glory for you during the days of the Ancient Romans. The UI takes a bit of time to understand what to do, but once you have it figured out the game plays very well. It isn't on Out of the Park Baseball's level, but you have to commend building such a unique concept.			"

												What are you looking for in a game?If you buy this game expecting flashy graphics and awesome fight scenes then you'll be disappointed.Why?Because at the end of the day, the dev is a solo outfit and concentrates his efforts and resources into gameplay and UI scenes. There's a lot of care gone into the visual screens you do see and a fair amount of thought into the layout.So. What's it like?Its a no-nonsense, casual management sim. End of.Gameplay is simple and UI is intuitive. The game itself has a fairly medium learning curve and there's nothing too complicated or hard to get to grips with.For the small price, you get what you pay for. This is a casual game that you can play quite happily hidden behind whatever you may be doing at work :) Theres not a lot to it, but there is a good re-playability factor.If you like something that offers a reasonable challenge with not a lot of frills for a reasonable price, then you can't go far wrong here.

												Elysium doesn't look like much, but this is a well balanced game and worthwhile for some casual play. The difficulty seems alright in the time I've been playing it. I have enough gold to do what I want to do, and nothing more. The Ludus upgrades give you something to play for. Since the updates , the better guy will win a fight as much as you'd expect (although there are upsets). The updates have improved the play considerably and they are coming frequently.As a downside, there's still a bit too much randomness in the game. For example, on my first turn I looked through the available free agents and found a guy who was a monster - his lowest stat was 78. It shouldn't bet that easy to acquire a fighter like that. I also think it would be better if you competed against other schools who could also bid on fighters. But overall this is worthwhile.			"

												( first review ever)I enjoyed this game - for what I view it as, which is a casual sim game. For those skeptical of the game, I encourage getting it - Its simplistic enough and the information panels do a good job of informing you of each stat and its purpose. The dialoge is fairly generic, doesnt have much variety but gives you enough to keep you entertained from panel to panel. Alot of the text-based combat feels akin to very very very luck based two handed rock paper scissors roll. I think this works in the games favor. And adds a level of frustration when you somehow lose a fight, but it makes you want to keep going. There is a lightweight stat upgrade system via sending up to two of your 3 member roster into 2 types of training. Theres a very light level of customization in-game. Tho if you are one of the master-pc race veterans like myself, youll discover you can edit almost anything in the game ( I put my own jpeg gladiator profile pics and .wave files into the game must like in wasteland 2/3) its a casual game, there arent many negative points from me after playing for a few hours. I would like to see a better gold sink, Sitting at 60,000+ gold ( from the in game wager system) with nothing to dump it into feels lacking, I would love to see a weapon system or armor system to dump it into. I would love to see more depth into the stat allocation. I also feel the stat weights are a bit high, I went into a 7 season 20 day game growthing a gladiator into over 120 or 2 stats, still was losing to glads with 40-60 of every stat whereas my lowest stat was 90... **got curious , edited the save file to 300 of every stat to see if it changed anything, it didnt by much** REALLY my only complaint. I wasnt paid to do this review, I wasnt given anything to write this review, all of the above is solely my opinon based on my expirences from playing the game, I recommend this game as a time sink to anyone who enjoys number games or stat games. I enjoyed it :D i only hope it improves. "

												If all your knowledge about gladiatorial combat come from display of testosterone in the ""Spartacus"" TV Show, prepare to get REKT in the REKTum with Jupiter's Member in Elysium: Blood Games. There is no glory and no pleasures to be had. Only hard work and failure await you and your fighters!  Being a Praetor ain't easy. There is no tutorial except poorly written scraps of help. There is no actual flow of actions, you'll get lost many times on you way to the arena. Your eyes will bleed red tears as you navigate the primordial soup of undefined UI made of free textures. Gladiators made of 3D poser blank faces will have no sympathy for their master.Your fighters will die in combat. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Maybe because you forgot to equip them with weapons. Maybe because you never found the sub-sub-sub-menu where you can buy a weapon. Maybe because you told them to be aggressive, so they got killed by a weaker defensive foe. And the rare times when they will stand victorious, they will get drunk, slap a woman and get suspended until the end of the game. Get used to it. Maybe you made good money on his one and only victory. Too bad you lost it by betting on the steroid-jacked gladiator with all the best stats who got defeated by a sentenced to death anorexic slave. But hey, money easy earned are money easy spent. I am a big fan of deep, complex and hard to learn simulation games and particularly those dealing with the deadly gladiatorial combat, so when this game got featured in Indie Gala Monday bundle, it was my selling point. However even if I keep struggling to figure out the game, I cannot fathom why all the positive reviews for a game so randomly designed and so bad in visual taste that it succeeds only to disappoint.

A Gladiator Management Simulator

In this game you train a small group of gladiators, and have this fight in the arena in hopes of winning and earning precious gold.+ Lots of player choices to influence fights which goes as far as even bribing the opponent to lose on purpose.+ An interesting stat system which you can improve by training or by essentially temporarily giving your gladiator performance enhancing drugs- The combat system seems to be based more on luck than anything else, and it's often completely unclear on what or why things are happening or who is going to win in the end.- Entirely text based, I wish there was at least a way to watch the fights take place- During fights the text scrolls by a bit too quickly (You can change this in the settings)Overall I'd say this is a pretty decent simulator for anyone who's interested in the inner working of a Ludus, training slaves to fight for you to win you glory and gold.

												I've wanted a gladiator game like this for a long time. It's a perfect setting for a management game, having to monitor your fighter's health, upgrade their stats, lead them to glory or fire them if they're not performing as well as you want. The first season is fun but the game gets better as you continue, adding to your own statistics and working your way towards the larger arenas, more money and more fame. It's also easy to mod, which adds tons of replayability and customisation options.			"

												ElysiumBlood games is a fun little casual text game where you take control of a ludus and its 3 gladiators and try to trian them to ultimate glory and legend. If you enjoy molding and building charatcers to become savage killing machines then this game is just right for you.The dev is constantly updating and adding new features. And he is very interactive with the community and listens to them in how they want the game to evolve.You are probabaly not going to get 100s of hours of game play for this but you will deff get well more then you pay for with this hidden gem. 4.99 is a  steal for this one.

												Very complete text based gladiator (micro-)managing and fighting game.You can choose the upgrade your arena, bribe people, upgrade gladiators. You can choose who will be your main gladiator and give them training so they will perform better next match. You do make an income from betting on matches. Who would have thought that this game would even include betting ?The game has so much information available about everything available that's it's difficult to sum up everything. If you want an almost endless amount of options, this game has it.Even the text based arena fighting has been done nicely. I was able to loose my gladiator on the first day. I do miss seeing gladiators fighting without having to read the text about their fights. I guess this is not the game for it.I'd give it a 7/10A key was kindly provided for review purposes.			"

												If running your own gladiator school appeals to you and you don't mind an old school interface, this is a fun and great value management game.   It's set in a fantasy world with only cosmetic similarities to Rome (e.g. gladiator schools are still called Ludas)  - but for me at least that's a good thing, as I find Ancient Roman culture rather un likeable.  There's several different options for improving your fighters, making sure they win, and maximising revenue and attendance.  The actual fights can be quite tense, with good, concise written descrptions of the action. Audio is a week point, but not an issue if you youtube some epic music while you're playing.   For a casual game, there is  a slight learning curve at the start-  no tutorial, so you have to explore the tool tips and info screens to work out what to do.  But this only take 20 mins and then game play is nice and simple, with enough moments of tension to keep it interesting.			"

												Behind some unexplained stats lies a reasonably fun little simulator. Send your Gladiators on quests, train them up and bet on matches.Don't expect epic visualizations of the combat, it is all via text. IMO, good descriptions beat terrible visuals any day.

It has an a good stat system with the ability to progress characters, its an easy game to get the hang of and has an easy to use layout. My main problem with it was there is currently nothing to spend money on but after speaking to the developer I found out new content will be added in time such as weapons and stable managment, Im really looking forrward to seeing the game develop and I think its worth the £3.99 I paid for it.

												to be updated...steam keeps kicking me off the review page, so updating on notepad.Disclaimer: I was provided a key from a developer in order to help provide honest critique and improve their game.Pros/Cons occur as I encounter them...you may want to watch the movie Gladiator[2000] if you're running out to ideas for improvements.Pros ++Good soundtrack+Simple starting menu+I for information button+Influence is temporary, so be wise when you want to use it.+Voiced battles+Weapons have durability+Weapon Repair+In-game settings, but limited+Save system+Hidden Objectives+Realism, what more could you ask for? Real life consequences for enhancements/brewsIn order to train a fighter you must take them off as the current fighter.Cons --No optimization: video settings[Resolution/Graphic Enhancements], music options-No Tutorial/Mini-game to help players learn the game throughly.Suggestion 1: doesn't have to be fancy, going through daily actions and combat with little information windows that is separate from main game like an option in the main menu.-Too much information is thrust at player when i button is pressedSuggestion 1: a pop-up text when your mouse pointer is hovering over characteristics[Loyalty, Performance, ect]Possible Suggestion 2: a mini information button next to each characteristic if suggestion 1 is too hard.-No difficulty setting-Music Mute Button doesn't work-Redundant Gladiator Strategy, start of match you have an overall attitude, but that doesn't matter since you're controlling strike by strike-Defensive attack should do more damage-No critical attacks rolls, or atleast let us know if it's a critical hit.-Gladiators should have a personality[aggressive, careful, deathwish, ect]-No possiblity of Murdering your opponentToo rare at the moment and it should be possible for fighters to die due to injuries sustained after losing a fight.-No current champion to challenge at end of a season-No generalized quests such as a challenge given from another opposing ludus.-Nothing to do except train, bet, or fight-No achievements-No gold alternative to healing fighters-No weapon shop refresh button-Not many uses for gold-Can't change weapons/unequip to equip on another fighter.-No alternative ways of making money such as requests from other praetorians for, ""time alone,"" with a fighter, but this may negatively affect the fighter if he's fighting tomorrow though i'm not sure what age group this game is targeting.@ it's current state...Overall Rating:4/10Honestly only needs polishing to become an 8, or better.0-3 Terrible/Needs work4-5 Average6-8 Enjoyable9-10 Excellent, needs no improvementI rarely thumbs down a game unless it's: unplayable on modern machines, support is gone, not updated[unless it's a finished product], falsely advertises, or a cash grab.Unfortunately, sim games such as these are not my taste, so my review may be biased towards the game genre that I am used to.

												Really good concept. Very surprised that so few Gladiator sim management games exists with the popularity of movies and shows revolving around them. This game is very simple, and does have an active developer. It has muuch room for exansion, tweaking and enhancement. There is a few visual optimizations that eed to be done, mostly involving the game not fitting windows correctly and causing some UI problems (Like trying to find where to click, Haven't compared i t to the other similar game ""Age Of Gladiatiors"" which also on Steam (Really cutting back on Steam purchases due to this market authenticator nonsense, so mostly only purchasing games from legit key sites, and the other simulator hasn't appeared on any of those yet TMK). But back to this one. It's pretty fun desite the little UI probs. Does get immersive and I'm enjoying it so far. Certainly worth the small price if you are into sims. Hopefully one day a seriously immersive one (Breeding..lol, personality, more stats, weapons, and so forth will come along one day). So I so reccomend it , for this price and it's casual nature. It can at least give you a small genre fix...and with continued support perhaps the Dev willl exand, tweak and continue improvements.			"

 Gameplay Elysium is a very good casual strategy game,we play commanding our warriors through battles in the arena,where we can choose their weapons,their attacks on the battle,their action when starting a battle,and much other things.The game itself is controlled all by the mouse,and have several features like changing the speed of things on the game,can be saved any hour(except in battles), if you lose a warrior you can change to another after the battle and much other things.you need patience and time to play this game,so if you don't like this type of games,jump to another because elysium is pure strategy game. Positive Points + Cheap+ Very good gameplay+ Long Duration and infinity options to play+ Small+ Saves Negative Points - Achievements Overall This game is really fun,but like i said before if you don't like strategy games skip this,it can be a boring game for you!8/10 Key given by the developer to review purposes  "

												Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the brand new Indie Management Sim Elysium: Blood Games.

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Another hit from SimProse. HIGHLY addictive gameplay. 4/5The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:SimProse Studios has done it again. Now, this game is NOT going to blow you away graphically or with it's sounds. They are good, especially considering the type of game this is. Elysium: Blood Game is very much a Stats/Management Sim. Although the comparison got me into a little trouble with Redemption, it still rings true: These games are like OOTP-Lite for RPG's, in a sense. Allow me to explain. Out Of The Park makes VERY deep simulations for Baseball and Hockey. What SimProse does so incredibly well is take that concept (managing your team to win it all) and translates it into darker, grittier aspects of past ages. Redmeption absolutely nailed this with it being an OOTP-Lite for Dungeons. This game here nails it for Gladiators.Pretty much a Sports Sim for Gladiators, really. Assemble your team, train your team, you can even gamble in this game to raise your funds. You can promote your fights (can you get the King to show up to your fight and cheer your guy on?). Recruit new Gladiators from the Free Agent pool. Watch as they get injured, retire, suspended, etc just like in pro sports! Performance enhancing elixirs? Yup. Got those too! Just careful of running that risk! Did I mention that ONE GUY does all this? These games are even more amazing when you consider ONE guy did all of this, and if it is anything like Redemption, he will work endlessly to refine the game. You have a dedicated Developer making some awesome, addicting games here. Swoop up the SimProse goodies, friends. Streets of Chaos, Redemption: Eternal Quest and now Elysium: Blood Games belong in the libraries of ANY Simulation fan, particularly if you enjoy the sports-sims like OOTP. This will be RIGHT in your wheelhouse. Take my monies, SimProse....you did it again! These games are cheap and insanely addicting. 4/5Happy Gaming!			"
