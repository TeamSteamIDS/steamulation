												I gave  2K15 a good review and that was after a couple Patches that made the game usable. 2K16 came around and it's the same engine, basically the same game but with a ton more flaws and issues and i don't know how that is even possible. I mean in 2K15 for example the Lakers had their real arena light, that means, all the lights on court while the crowd area is darkend. In 2K16 it's the same bright lit arena like everywhere.But that's just one of the more superficial flaws this game has. So far i encountered:  - During Games the commentators stop working, that was a problem in 2K15 but is even worse here now with the commentators stop all the time, in every match be it a mycareer match, a online match, myteam match, all the time- Sound effects and Music also stop, you play one match in Mypark with the Music, all sound effects and the next match you only have the sound effects of Park itself, like the Bird and Sea sounds on the Park or the Steel mill sounds on the Rough Riders Park but you won't hear the players, the ball or anything else.Now of course one could argue that sound is just one thing but there are many other problems- Invisible players, that happens everywhere be it the park or an offline game, sometimes player get invisible but they still play, making points and everything- You get fouled out (6 fouls) but you can still play- Players shoot at the wrong hoop (happens with the AI)- AI players don't know how to behave and resemble more a bunch of scared chickensThere are more issues all around, i have a screenshot of the Store where rings are displayed as pants, that's not fixed one month later. - Random crashes, unable to invite friends, connection problems, disconnections in the MyPark, connection errors (including crash to desktop) on MyCourt when you invite friends do exist. 2K's servers are notoriously bad and have been bad for the past few years over console generations and now on the PC. It's baffling they don't fix their crap which leads me to the next point: - Microtransactions. With 2K15 2K introduced  VC to the game, you earn VC by playing matches, be it online, mycareer, mypark or whatever which you can invest in shoes, jerseys, shorts or use on the MyTeam mode as with always, microtransactions on a game that costs 50€ (at least, the MJ edition was 69,99€) is questionable, while you can earn them, you can buy them with real money and 2K this year made sure you can't get enough VC without paying for them. MyTeam has Card Packs that cost 7.500 VC, there are shoes up to 15.000 VC, Jerseys up to 5.000 VC and regardless if you unlock shoe contracts or not, the shoes you design yourself in the main menu outside the career cost you 7.500 VC, regardles of a shoe contract and if you want to proudly display the jersey of your team you play in career in the online park you need to get to a certain park reputation and on top of it, the jersey is another 5.000 VC. Last year those Team Jerseys in the Park were free, now even for that 2K wants your money. The positive things, are the new things: Team relocation in MyGM and MyLeague are fun and in MyTeam you can use the same features about getting your own Logo (better make sure to not use any trademarked stuff becuase apparently even using and old Team logo that is not available can get you banned and the game only supplies you with the regular 30 NBA Team Logos, despite having classic logos and jerseys available in MyTeam but you're not allowed to use them in MyGM/MyLeague, so you can upload them yourself but you risk getting banned because it is actually a breach of their TOS)Speaking of MyTeam, it's a grind through hundreds of the same cards and the same old challenges, in fact, it was a lot more fun last year where you could chose between Current and Classic Team Packs, now you only have 3 current packs and at the moment a Rookie Card Pack that can net you anything from a rookie to a silver to an amethyst card pack but most of the time you get the same guys over and over, i got 3 times the same blake griffin rookie of the year card. It's like the game is trolling you and just wants you to waste your MT Points or VC on crap. Talking about that i want to mention more bugs people had: - No Keyboard support, while i think playing a sports game on Keyboard (i haven't done that since FIFA 96 personally) is kinda dumb, i think a PC game should support the Keyboard. NBA 2K16 doesn't really, you can't configure keys and the pre-made layout is apparently made for aliens with 3 arms and several more fingers- In MyCareer you might receive MyTeam Cards through connections...at least that's the theory. I unlocked a few, never got the cards- Same with the rival day on MyPark, the second week me and some friends helped the Sunset Beach securing a victory and despite constant ""Claim your reward on the kiosk"" messages, we never got the promised VC and reduction of Boosts. And now we come to the big hype this year: Livin' da Dream - A Spike Lee JointThe premise is actually fun: You start in High School, play College and then go to the NBA. Certainly better than the ""Not getting drafted story from last year"" but: You can't really customize your player, you are from Harlem, your nickname is Frequency Vibrations, shortened to Freq and you're basically forced to create a black player because otherwise it's absurd to have black parents and a black twin sister. So you start in High School which consists of 3 games followed by College (you can select 1 of 9 colleges but it makes no real change at all) which lasts for 4 Games and after than you're in the NBA, after you got drafted your rookie season consists of 8 games (and 1 playoff match, if you're lucky) while the rest is simulated. The game actually acts like you should have a choice, like teasing a decision about wether you do a second college year or go straight to the NBA or later ""state your oppinion about your shoes"" which was mistaken by many to be a shoe deal which it isn't, it's just cutscenes you have no influences whatsoever and most of those scenes drag on for too long (some are over 10 minutes) and you sit there and wonder ""is this a badly written movie or am i still playing a game?"" only to realize ""i'm stuck in a badly written story full of cliche, annoying (and sometimes racist) characters and plot holes (like your player constantly switching between a 3 time and a 4 time all-american) in a game full of bugs that make me play matches for the sake of seeing more stupid soap opera like cutscenes""Once your after the rookie season you start MyCareer but it's still not your Career as mentioned above, you can select a ""secondary nickname"" but the PA and the Announcers as well as the Pre- and Post-Game Show still call you Freq all the time. It's highly annoying. I could go on and on with the flaws, how 2KTV makes the game crash at random times in the main menu, the performance is abysmal because it's a very badly optimized game, how disconnections, crashes, glitches and limitations hinder everything and 2K doesn't care and of course how the online mode is filled with cheater on the park or the obnoxious ce-quitters in myteam and of course that even the music while being a great diverse soundtrack with various styles and some truly great songs is censored to the point where songs consist of mostly audio drop outss, the worst example being NAS - Made you Look which is so horribly butchered that the finaly 10 seconds only consist of the word spit because everything else is erased because it contains ""filthy words"". So all in all, while the basis of the game is still a good basketball game, it has too many bugs, glitches, flaws, cheaters with 2K apprently only caring about saving their precious microtransactions and nothing else. So all i can say, is: Don't buy the game and don't support 2K because they simply don't care.			"

												Before I go into the gameplay, let's address the elephant in the room. Spike Lee's My Career. I have a big problem with being forced to be black for the story to make sense. Not because there's anything bad about being black (full disclosure: I'm a black man), but because its lazy writing. Spike seems to want to tell his story of a struggling black kid from Harlem, New York making it to the NBA. That's great for a movie, but this is supposed to be a game. And the best games give the player the most choices. Choices are why Western RPGs like Dragon Age:Inquisition & Skyrim are more popular right now than Japanese RPGs that force you to play through a bunch of set pieces as their stock protagonist. I'm opposed to any game mode that removes choice from players, especially when those choices existed in last year's game.With that out of the way, NBA 2K16's gameplay has improved over the past two iterations. Defense is more effective & physical. You can't just bully your way into the post with a random SF anymore. Shot selection seems to be even more important this year & fastbreaks actually seem fast this year. The 2K Shop, however, is another matter. They're selling virtual Gatorade now?!? C'mon man...that's just a blatant cash grab. Everything costs VC this year. Designing your court would be great if they didn't nickel & dime you to death for accessories. I know that you can earn some things through My Career, but its still ridiculous to charge 500 VC for different colored nets.Overall, I enjoy the gameplay more than ever. But 2K needs to stop letting outsiders write stories for games & be a bit less greedy next year. Pick this up now if you're absolutely addicted to sports games. Otherwise, catch it on the next Steam sale.			"

												When you play NBA2k most like the Story mode, NBA2k knew that so they brought in somebody who knows Basketball and how to put together a good story, Spike Lee. This game proved to me that my assumptions about Spike Lee were correct. He cant write a good story, the only city in this mans mind is New York, and there is only 1 race in Spikes world, Black. If you enjoy personal player customization, than this game is NOT for you. Pike Lee stereotyped this game all over the place, if your Asian, Russian, White, Mexican, etc, than im sorry, but according to this game, your now African American, but you can choose what shade of African American, so thats good I guess. There is only 1 voice for your charactor. If you try to make your charactor look as much like another ethnic group as possible, you then have to deal with the fact you have a black family, which is fine, I can do the adopted thing, but wait, you have a twin sister who is also black. Now, your name, you'd probably like to have your very own name wouldnt you, too bad, you are now known as ""Freq"", which is short for Frequency Vibrations. Oh ya, you live in the projects in Harlem, nowhere else, you cant choose LA, Houston, Canada, London, nope, its Harlem. Your best friend is a drugged out loud mouth, your sister wont give you any privacy. How about choosing a college to goto, that you can do, aslong as your favorite school is 1 of the 8 they give you to choose from. Now, im not saying thoe entire game is junk, its not, infact the only part of the game thats junk is the MyCareer mode, all the other aspects of the game are fine. Well, except for those who pre-ordered the game and didnt get what was promised for those who pre-ordered, ugh!			"

												Much was made about the Spike Lee directed Career/Story Mode but I found it really lacking and hugely disappointing. The biggest problem I have with this was the absolute heavy-ham-handed scripting which instead of adding to immersion actually kills it completely.Firstly, My Career has always been about creating a player that is you (or that you want) regardless of race. Spike Lee pigeon-holes and shoe-horns you into poor black kid growing up in the projects in Harlem. Cliched much?My Career tries to present two of the fundamental choices/problems that blue-chip college/young NBA players have: such as whether or not to go one-and-done; whether or not to stick with your homie who's had your back forever but is a bad influence or to ditch him for the good of your career.So much is made about these problems and how hard it is to choose. Your character literally agonizes over each choice. Then the game/story goes ahead and makes the choices for you. Well duh ... if you're going to belabour the point and make it such a big deal, and if it really is MY career, then I would like to have a say in it, wouldn't you? I honestly only started enjoying the game a bit more after the script ended. Also another pet peeve is the big deal they make of your created player: high school phenom, blue-chip prospect, once in a generation talent, etc, etc. And you come into the draft with a skill level of 55? This may not be a big deal (and actually fit with the last edition where your player went undrafted) but the disparity is so immersion-breaking. From having 'boosted' stats in High School/College where your 7 foot centre can literally hit 3-pointers from everywhere to missing 2 feet lay-ups in the NBA ... i should think that if I'm actually good enough to be drafted top-20 in the NBA draft i should be at least be able to make a jump-shot or two.Also, because of whatever reason, your rookie season is abridged into eight games so that Spike Lee can turn your rookie career into a blurb. Which means you only play 8 games (i.e. compared to the regular season 82 you would have played in previous editions - meaning you literally miss out one entire year of skill points and never have a chance to break into the starting line-up). It also means the whole Rookie of the Year target which most players set their sights on is pretty much impossible/redundent.   Game-wise its generally more of the same with better animations. A more robust blocking/swatting system is much welcome. But generally the AI appears to be more tepid and less intelligent this edition. The point-guard hogs the ball way too much and makes really bad decisions/shots. The transition game appears better and fast breaks are a lot more viable but the PC-controlled teams appear to have a huge edge in the transition game (most of the time your team are not even back in their half-court set when the other team pushes the ball back up the court for an empty lane). tldr: Spike Lee's story kills the immersion and the real game/fun only starts when it ends. They should have made the story-mode a toggle on/off feature when starting a new career. I feel that 2k15 plays a little better and is more immersive.			"

												This review is mainly slated towards MyCareer.It's really upsetting, I played a lot of NBA 2K15 and after spending a majority of time finishing MyCareer and MyGM/MyLeague, I definitely got my money's worth after 300+ hrs. NBA 2K16, however, got pretty overhyped when regards to their MyCareer, which seemingly got worse.I think most people were under the impression that after all the positive feedback 2K14 and 2k15 got in regards to MyCareer, and how they enjoy a story around your character, 2k would finally go all out with one this year by hiring Spike Lee to direct it.Somehow, they went backwards. Even though 2k never had a white voice actor, hiring Spike Lee to be a ghetto visionary and make your family black and growing up in Harlem sort of ruins any illusion that most of the white players could relate to, which btw, alot of your audience is.As for the customization people were hoping for, it some how becomes even more linear with Spike Lee making a strict storyline with choices you can not choose. Literally, the only choices you can make in MyCareer is Choosing a High School (1 of 3), choosing a college (1 of 9), and at the end of 8 games played (of 82) you get to become a free agent. Meaning if you wanted to play the 2015-2016 league, you only are playing 8 games against the legitimate rosters, and then enter free agency.How did this happen? Outside of actual games, MyCareer lasted a total of maybe an hour. After completeing college and moving into the draft, Im finally in the NBA, next to top draft picks that have overalls of 78 and 77, meanwhile I have 55 overall and am somehow considered a top 10 pick. Where's summer league? Training camp? Where is anything that can allow me to actually progress without having to spend VC on attributes ? Most people do NOT want to start the NBA with 55 overall and don't want to have to spend money on VC to stay competitive.As for what they did right, High School and College felt legitimately realistic. You're a high school phenom, and as such your character is seriously OP. You can steal and run the ball and shoot better than everyone, and as you progress towards the NBA, games get harder in college. Unfortunately there was no real culture to talk about with colleges, the only differences is the uniform and logo, and High School + College combined are over very quickly.Edit: More time put into MyCareer and gameplay is still solid, and now that the mediocre story is over, the grind for getting badges and practicing in the gym is actually enjoyable. Connections would be more interesting if they were more indepth and you weren't able to exploit them, but overall a nice addition. Still disappointing overall.Another annoying thing to point out is the fact that during creating MyPlayer, while height and wingspan actually matter in this version of 2k ( which is a good thing ), the fact that choosing inside/outside/balanced position when creating your character limits your possibility as a player, and can't be changed. As a balanced 6'6 SF with maxed shooting, my 3 pt is below average that of another SF in the league.			"

												Having pre-ordered NBA 2K16 (following the hype train, woot-woot!), I got the opportunity to play already, and I was able to quickly form an opinion on the in my eyes most important mode of the game, the MyCareer mode. I’m one of those who basically bought the game for this mode alone, where you take control of a new player in the NBA and lead him to greatness.By now, I’ve played three quarters of my rookie season, after leading my player through high school and first year of college. I’m blown away by how much of a blowout this game is. “Hold it right there for a second,” you might say, “the game isn’t out long enough for you to have played so far ahead!” If I didn’t know better, I would agree with you on that. The problem is, however, your “rookie season” is 8 (eight!) games long.Yes, you’ve read right. I was shocked when I got to the “gym menu” and read that it was the first of eight games I would get to play in my rookie season. It’s frustrating. The game doesn’t give you any option to change this. This is not a basketball simulation anymore, it’s a farce.I want to lead my player through all 82 games of a season (plus even more in post-season, if possible), and in full-length at that. Maybe I don’t get much further than my rookie season until the next game comes out, but I’m with my player all the way until then. When the commentators praise my last game, I want to have been there for that. Why should I give a damn about what the AI made my player do? I don’t get any credits for that to spend on my abilities, I don’t get any chance to rise to starhood early on, and I don’t get any sort of information how I’m doing outside of the commentary for the next game I’m playing, or at least I haven’t found it in the cryptic menu structure.“Featuring a Spike Lee joint” is the worst thing they could’ve done. You’re forced to suffer through one of the most annoying stories I’ve ever played. And I’ve been through all of “Dying Light”. They praise it in the trailers with “Be The Story”. Guess what, that’s all you get to do, because you can’t make one on your own.I didn’t know what to expect, so my player is pretty much me. Every NBA 2K game I’ve played before gave me the opportunity to “be myself”, which mostly meant, a white guy with a similar name (so the commentators don’t just call me by my nickname) and “College” Germany (and a different height, depending on the position). In 2K16, that means a 7ft tall (Center) white guy has a black twin sister that seems at least a foot smaller, has no similarities in their looks whatsoever, and stays bland throughout the story, a problem all characters have in this. You don’t get to choose anything about yourself beside the appearance and some on-court details. Everything but the teams you play for is pretty much set in stone; and the teams you play for do not change the story a bit. You follow a story of some random dude, instead of forming him yourself. There are some major crossroads he just barrels through without you being consulted. But hey, you can choose to go to UCLA instead of UConn. Congratulations.Even when you think you can choose something important (what a heated discussion in a cut scene about staying another year in College or agreeing to enter the Draft builds up to), he just says, “here’s what I’m going to do…”, cut to black screen, and whoop-de-do, welcome to the NBA Draft 2016!I feel no connection to Harlem. I feel no connection to the family. Suddenly I have a girlfriend, and I have no idea why she’s here (when I first saw her, I was like “Hey, who’s that? Oh, she looks nice, and she’s in an important meeting… she might be my girlfriend. Oh her name’s Yvette? Cool.”). My so-called best friend is always up to no good and I spend six-figure sums in lawyers and settlements to keep everything quiet about him and his escapades. My agent (who I obviously don’t get to choose, either) is a New Yorker, a self-proclaimed “Shark” with italian roots, where every “Mobster cliche” bell in my head starts ringing like a shot clock. I have no say in this at all. The story tries very hard to create drama (to the point where it’s hard for me to suspend my disbelief), but it fails miserably at making me care, because it lacks decisions where my actions would have any sort of impactful consequences. If this was a movie, I wouldn’t see it in theatres, I wouldn’t rent it, and wouldn’t even waste my time on it would it be on Netflix.Technically, the game is up to snuff concerning the simulation part, even though I despise getting fouled out in the third quarter because of the mechanics for setting picks (and for calling illegal screens). Otherwise, it’s ridiculously bad. The menu structure is horrible, you don’t find anything quickly. A training option where you get to train the moves one by one is completely missing, instead you get four instructional videos with instructions read by NBA stars who can muster about as much enthusiasm as if they were reading a recipe for sour cream cheesecake - or dubbing a 70s sex ed video. In the few hours I’ve played, I’ve had about half a dozen Back-To-Desktop crashes, without the game freezing (it just closed the window). Other than that, the servers aren’t the most reliable, but that might be because the game isn’t even officially released yet. Oh god, I dread what it will be like in the week following the official release...Graphically, it looks very good, but that’s to be expected. There isn’t much more to improve graphically, anyway. Last year’s NBA 2K looked great, too. My PC isn’t the best out there, but it manages to give a decent image.UPDATE: As one of the comments so helpfully pointed out, the game ""reverses back to normal"" in the second season. The so-called ""story"" only ruins your rookie year, but oh boy is it bad, and cheesy, tacky, and all sorts of wrong. I write fanfiction for a hobby and I would've been able to write a better story on a tipsy saturday evening. After now going strong in my second season, the game does get better; but I still can't bring myself to recommend it, most of all not at full price. You lose the probably most important season of your career to a joke of a story.Bugwise, it's playable, although for me there's one recurring thing: it has a kinda useful feature telling you things about your opponent when you come into the game (at tipoff or from the bench), but sometimes it fails to load that overview (only showing the player in idle animation), and the game takes about 20 sec to skip that screen and go back into the game.TL;DR: It’s not a bad game, per say, and perhaps you’ll find joy in it if you don’t care about the MyCareer mode, but in that mode, it dumps all its negative points right in my face early on although I usually like the NBA 2K franchise. I will continue playing it at least until after my rookie season, and maybe pick it up again once they bring me a patch that fixes this abomination called “Featuring A Spike Lee Joint”. Until then, keep away from this because no way this is worth the full price.TL;DR: UPDATE: Got to second season. Story over, so game got better. Rookie season still ruined. Don't buy at full price.

												Been playing NBA2k games since 2k12 and I've noticed this year is pretty ridiculous. I generally play MyCareer as it is the most popular game mode, but I do occassionally play the others.Pros:- The game looks great visually- Easy to adapt to new controls- Harder to do certain things that wasn't exactly basketball-like that older games had- Overall very smooth with decent cpuCons:- MyCareer is a racist joke: I ain't black so why is my twin sister black. Stereotypes everywhere. Spike Lee was the worst part about this game.- Not new user friendly: Be ready to throw your wallet to get any sort of decent start because your mycareer starts with a sub60 rating.- HOF Cpu is cheese itself: Wide-open jumpers fall 98% of the time. More shocked when it misses.- Some players just don't make sense: Bench players in real NBA and with low ratings in game plays like Kobe shooting over three guys.- AI defense is horrible: 80+ rating 3pt rating guard that can't finish on the outside? AI leaves him open. Pick and roll switch up? Non-existent. Basic man-to-man? How about Otto Porter Shaqtin a Fool every game. 30 RPG as a team and your player point guard has 8 of them? Why not.- Moving like you're on ice: Your player slides and glides like he's on ice and occassionally gets stuck when defending. Absolutely ridiculous.- AI passing: Have fun with turnovers because your AI teammates can't do jack.- MyCareer is a joke: Spike Lee is the worst part about this game. Oh wait... I said this already.- Certain players are just overpowered: Stephen Curry is a prime example.- Certain players just don't match with their stats and tendencies: Lebron is like the easiest thing to guard and Jeremy Lamb shoots over anybody and everybody. James Johnson shoots threes with a crap rating and low tendency which essentially means a turnover if he catches the ball near the three. - Refs are walking picks: I run into the ref on the fast break cuz they just on the court. I called for a pass and that thing ain't stopping until it gets to China.- Player does its own thing: Getting stuck in animations, not being able to do anything in certain situations (dive for ball and catching it, spin move and it starts pole dancing), and hyping up the crowd when opposing guard goes coast to coast for a dunk.- Get rid of the coach: He's annoying. How you gonna tell me score more inside when the only baskets we get are dunks. - WTF timeouts: They don't make sense *PERIOD* You get subbed in and a timeout comes immediately after they score. 10/10 trash programming.- Bounce passes: Slow, clunky, and receiver thinks its a booger and runs from it. No more fancy passes guys, stick with pick-n-roll and hope they don't do some superhuman sh** and intercept it outta nowhere.- Opposing HoF Defense is hax: Melo jumped over 8ft into the air to swat an alley-oop pass. Checked it in replay and Anthony Davis's head was under his feet. I broke up laughing at how sh** this game was when that happened. Wasn't even mad. Oh yeah and every player has whips as arms since they block passes out of their range.While a lot of these cons are persistent problems in the 2k games, it's just getting worse. Hyping up the MyCareer didn't help; it just added a sh** ton of backlashes.			"

You cant play in your rookie season...well... you can like 8 games. I liked the highschool and collage part but the story is just simple Sh** , you just want to skip it, dialogueis cringy as hell, well it was written by Spike Lee nothing more to expect... i like the off days option to do things you would like and i like the ""Live practice"" but one thing is missing from that... you cant improve your attributes by going to live practice like you could have in 2k11, you will just get a boost and xp thats it and you can earn a little vc like 50. Upgrading attributes- i hate it, those upgrade bars or what ever you call it , its stupid, bring the simple old one.-Gameplay- has so many flaws , pick and rolls are the worst , and each update they try to fix it before updates it was good enough you could live with that , 1st update broke every AI play would reach on pass and you couldnt get the pass trought on the 2nd one they made it great again, 3rd one i dont know, and now i think 4th its bad , seems like noone can set a screen , Noel, Cousins,Okafor or any other center cant do a screen they will catch contact with like 5th screen every  one who plays basketball knows if you set a screen you have to catch the player so the defender will switch, but dude sets the screen away from the player so the defender would go over the screen untouched, like what the hell and if the screen works the bigman would run away from the basket and wont get into position, so pick and roll is not effective at all.-Should be more options to get VC, by playing MyGm for example.-Passing should be fixed if a dude is wide open next to you and you point at him and pass the pass will go across the court to another dude that is defended by 2 defenders ... like why .....MyTeam wise the game improved alot and its soo fun to play, but this might be the worst MyCareer experience ever, it will make you more mad than happy... Didnt try MyPark yet, but when i upgrade my player i will.Overwall just for updates that simply doesnt add alot, for bad MyCareer, for stupid AI , for cringy story and for most of all this game costs 50 euros and at most this game should cost 25... so for all that i will give it a NO. BUT.... BUTT... ha butt .. But if it costs 16-22 euros buy it its worth that, play MyTeam mode and live happly :)Just Updateing for Event.			"

												MyCareer character is so weak in the beginning, weaker than in any previous 2k. Only a 50 rating. 2k clearly tries to force players to spend extra money on buying vc. Beware, VC cheese is coming.Rookie year is the most important year in my opinion for a basketball player, however, 2k clearly doesn't see it this way. You are only allowed to play 8 games in total, meaning that you will not be a starting player in your rookie year. Too much Spike Lee and too little NBA.			"

												After so 27 hours of playing, i can definitely say, 2K games screwed up pretty badly..Story, gameplay, optimization, VC... This is not my first NBA game. I've been playing NBA games since 98 and this year i got very excited about 2K16, but it really ruined every expactation of mine. First of all My Career. Are you serious? Spike Lee did this? I mean i don't have a high opinion about Spike Lee but this much?! Let me tell you guys, You are gonna watch series of cutscenes till you get into NBA. These cutscenes feel very very dull after watching some of them. and story is one person's dream. Not Livin' Da Dreeeaaammm. It's Spike Lee's Dreeeaamm... Damn..... So called Livin' Da Dream (My Career) is this. Cutscenes... Cutscenes.. Cutscenes... Optimization. I won't even write about it. If any official from 2K reading this, this is not acceptable.Pre-order bonuses. Unacceptable.I will definitely not buy 2K17 until i see reviews and youtube videos next year.			"

												Spike Lee was the absolute worst thing to happen to this game. MyCareer's rookie season is useless and the story is completely static and the same every time. You don't want to be a hard-luck baller from Harlem? Too bad. You want your family to be white, Asian, Latino, or just not black? Too bad. Spike Lee has to make a stereotypical Italian guy who talks about pizza and says capeesh. Your family MUST be from New York and living a rough life. This is terrible. I really hope 2k17 has more options for the backstory of your player.			"

												My honest thoughts about NBA2K16 and the NBA2K franchise:NBA2K16's gameplay is great. The overall presentation is very smooth and the graphics have really stepped up its game since 2K15. I don't think the controls are as great as it was in 2K15, but I don't really have any complaint about it. No more ripped jersey shorts when players are dunking. No more of those alien-esque eye contacts when camera pans in on the players' faces. Also a lot less shot-clock cheese.MyCareer this year has given me the most emotional turmoil, ever. I really disliked the story, as you probably have heard everywhere how Spike Lee tried to add in his 2 cents to 2K, which resulted in the your player's family being African American regardless of what color skin your player has. I do enjoy the many accolades your player is able to achieve and how quickly you are able to level your character up to at least an all-star level. One of the things I hated about the previous NBA2K MyCareers is how little of VC earnings you get after every game, but 2K has fixed that issue in this year's release.MyTeam is a mode I enjoy very much. Every week 2K releases packs that you are able to buy and every week it has a different series of challenges that you are able to compete. 2K has really increased the amount of variety of player cards that you are able to receive. For example, for every NBA player there are multiple player cards such as the player's default card, dynamic ratings card, moments card, playoffs card, TBT player card, all star card, MVP card, and many more. Each card by the same player has different ratings depends on the type of cards, and it really adds in some flavor in collecting your cards and makes it exciting to open up packs because it always catch you off guard on what cards you may get. My personal favorite: a bronze Sim Bhullar rated at 69, but is an absolute beast in the post both offensive and defensively in the game.MyPark in my opinion is... ehhh. The gameplay is really great and all, but a lot of the times the park is either empty or is just a bunch of people who have formed cliques, or squads, to play against each other. If you are just trying to play a game by yourself, good luck finding a match because ""you can't sit wid us"".Now, onto the franchise. Ronnie Singh aka Ronnie2K, the NBA2K public relations and the main spokesperson, is probably the biggest joke in the gaming industry. The guy has very limited NBA knowledge and is terrible at trying to attract gamers to come back for more NBA2K. I remember sometime in April when @NBA2K on twitter reached 1 million followers, Ronnie2K promised every gamer will receive a gift as a thanks to such an achievement. So what did some gamers get? A simple T-shirt for MyCareer, a knee-pad upgrade, or bronze players for MyTeam. What did I get? A 71 Rating Kendrick Perkins. Yeah, what a joke. This really agitated the NBA2K gaming community and as such, the community started a #Unfollow2K movement which trended on twitter for a couple of days. The very next day after it reached 1M followers, the follower count was at 989K followers.I honestly don't know if I would recommend this game, or any of the NBA2K releases going forward. Unfortunately 2K is dominating in the sports games with no other competitors in near sight (Yeah I said it, EA), so I might consider buying some future releases... keyword 'MIGHT'.Thanks for reading this review. I hope you find this review helpful on making your decisions in purchasing this release or any of the new NBA2K releases.			"

												Have you ever just wanted to pick up a sports game and make your own character and dominate the game? Well too ♥♥♥♥ing bad loser, you have to sit through an eternity of Spike Lee's explosive diaherria disaster of a story that drags on and on and on and garuntees you will never care about any other character except your own. Seriously, this story is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow and boring, and the characters are so annoying. I honestly don't care about the backstory of my player. I just want to play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. I did not spend money to watch my player get abused by an italian american sports agent. But the tremendously long cut scenes are not the only problem, however.In addition to cutscenes taking forever, it seems whenever there is a time out you are forced to watch your team walk to the bench, which takes around 5 seconds, but again, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. in 2k14, as soon as i heard the timeout whistle i'd just skip it and start playing again. That's all I want to do. Play. I do not want to look at the atmosphere of the game or any of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Just let me play.Lastly, however, when you are playing and finally get into the NBA, you can only play about 8 games or so your rookie year because of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing cutscenes. So essentially, Spike Lee is cockblocking you from developing your character his rookie year. Also, your player ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Can't make a jumpshot to save his life, can't get into the paint without forgetting how to dribble and losing the ball, and, if somehow you do get in the paint, you will be swarmed and the ball will be smited out of your hands. The absolute only thing you can be good at at this point in the game is free throws, and with your miniscule minutes, you will only get about 4 a game. When you finally get out of the trainwreck that is your rookie year, you can finally play a whole season without Spike Lee's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brain child of a story groping your asscheeks. You enter free agency and can essentially join who ever you want. I joined the Knicks, so I don't know if this is true for whatever team you join, but your teammates are actually braindead. No one moves on their own. Everyone just stands there and moves in the direction you move. The AI are so bad in this game, I think I'd rather have Kwamwe Brown on my team than Robin Lopez.Also, what really annoys me are the Halftime report, and the post game show. I honestly think that the developers thought that we would actually want to watch them. My record for number of times I've pressed the A button to skip it must be around 3,000. Seriously, no one wants to watch that stupid crap. I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME.Spike Lee cannot write and should not write ever again			"

												If you are not playing my career, this is probably the best 2k game ever.The my career is the worst its ever been, and I've owned like 6 different 2k games. The entire rookie season is totally ruined, the story is totally unnecessary and obnoxious. Buy 2k15 and download rosters, or wait til 2k17 and hope they get rid of this nonsense.			"

												I (actual me) play as an average size/weight forward-center in Australia. I used NBA2K10 previously, and found that after playing it I was more conscious of my court position and defense in real games. Shocked! Playing from third person perspective made me focus on things that I hadn't really nailed on the real courts. I actually spent a whole season playing 2K10 for a couple hours before every game.Overall, I think a guy like me is in a pretty excellent position to judge the gameplay here, so I think I owe it to everyone to review it.I made myself in the game - Average size center. 7'0, 260. Though real me takes few jumpers I opted for all-around.So far, the good stuff;I love the post movement! It really echoes the way a lot of new players are being taught to post - not thinking about individual moves but thinking about position and response - You make a move and shoot if your defender wasn't able to respond, step through if he responded too hard, and make a second move if he responds smartly. It's very fluid, it's exactly how I think about my real post movement, and I like it. The second season (Takes a long time to get there...) is much, much better than the ruined first season. You have choice about your actions. You are coached... (it's rudimentary but at least it makes you think about changing your game up). You get to train (awesome!), doing some drills that might look familiar to organized ballers, and there is plenty of variation so you don't just do the same drill every time. So far, the bad stuff; The main reason I'm not recommending this: It's freezing. Sometimes it locks my computer completely, sometimes it merely quits the program mid-game. The first few hours this wasn't an issue. Today it seemed to be happening every game or two. I really don't have time to screw around with this kind of issue, and I'm sure a lot of you don't either.Skipping training is a smart thing to do in season 2? Plain stupid. Since you literally buy your skill, practice is now just a waste of valuable marketing time. I actually liked the training drills - especially as a guy who is new to playing virtual-basketball and using a game pad. In shootaround at training, you can't go back-to-basket and do a post move. What? I guess my guy is afraid of getting hit in the back of the head by a bricked shot. ♥♥♥♥♥. Let me post like in the home court screen. It matters to me, I'm a F/C. I don't want to shoot 3-pointers.     Slow players jump unreasonably high. Head crashing into the backboard but I can't change direction. In real players, vertical leap is pretty closely related to the general speed of the player on his feet. Very noticeable in 55OVR F/Cs.   Starter F/Cs react so slowly that there's no way they could ever play NBA. The slow CPU centers easily bust past 2 step sags.     Guards tend to misuse my screens - use me to shear off the defender! They are afraid of brushing my shoulder.To make up for this, 2k have put in some STUPID AI/animations where the screened opponent will go out of his way to trip over you. I've had a guy constantly changing direction just to trip over me while his man is 40 feet away making a layup. Insane stuff - it feels like cheating. I've counted guys running into me 4 or more times, long after their player has made his move. Sometimes they run into me even though their man is cutting away from me. They WANT to hit the screen.     I have my stats elevated by crazy bursts of speed when I go for blocks and rebounds from way out.     There's no context to the actions - player never seems to bail out of a rebound when he should.     Forwards aren't ready for rebounds. They seem to set feet after you tell them to rebound, not when the shot goes.     At least one 3-sec violation per game because he refuses to move after ignored call for pass. UNFORGIVABLE.The lack of depth perception (Not 2k's fault, but still a problem) means it's impossible to judge where a lot of shots will fall, limiting your ability to be ready for rebounds. CPU always gets the rebound on short airballs. Always. I'd say center is unplayable at 55ovr, but it gets a lot better once you up your stats a few points across everything. Pretty irritated about the amount of time it took for it to be playable though - I shouldn't need 10 hours of gameplay to be able to change direction and make a freethrow. Put me on an even footing. I don't want to dominate, I just want to be in the game. I am not able to believe I wouldn't get benched after 20 minutes shooting 20%, with a plus/minus of -15.As for the rest - you heard it in every other review. The first season is completely ruined. You aren't actually in any control until the 2nd season, so I guess it's NBA2k17. What were they thinking? The game runs as badly as my player does. Tutorials are garbage. A white guy will have a black twin... Everything bad anyone else says is probably true. Oh - and it's pretty hilarious to have my own shoe after half a season making 8ppg coming off the bench. 10/10 for comedy value. (And it's ♥♥♥-ugly. Didn't previous versions let you design them?)

												Only buy this if you mostly play MyGM mode. The MyCareer is even worse than last years. MyCourt JUST started working. Play now online is also broken as half of the matches or more will end after halftime. MyGM is really good, not much improved from last year though. You still get annoyed all season by players and coaches bugging you about training intensity. VC is also a joke, and its needed to enjoy sections of the game. Also, why the ♥♥♥♥ cant you change your uniform color once youve found an opponent? Thats so dumb. ive had to quit multiple matches just because both teams ended up wearing black or red. the graphics dont look like the trailer either - i have max settings on and it looks like a shiny, oily version of 2k13/2k14. Only worth off key sites for discounts and for MyGM mode. otherwise, until alot of stuff is fixed, its not worth full price to anyone.Also, 2K, PLEASE bring back individual stats in MyCareer and stop making it dependant on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ VC. Why cant I make a guy that can hit the midrange but not threes? what if i want to play a slashing power forward who has a post game? I still will play 2k14s career over this one or 2k15.edit:Now there are even more gamebreaking bugs. The commentary, AGAIN, stops after the first half of the first quarter, then doesnt come back at all until the end of the fourth. and oh no, not just for mycareer this time, but for EVERY GAME MODE IN THE GAME. ♥♥♥♥ing christ 2k. ive bought your ♥♥♥♥ since 2k9 and im refusing to buy anymoreupdate 12/1/15 - game has crashed on me 10 times in on week. ♥♥♥♥ing christupdate 5/5/2016 - the game seems to run very solid now. Havent had a crash or D/C in months. Im still leaving this a thumbs down as the more you play, the more you realize how broken and annoying the defensive controls are in this game. stay away unless youre a hardcore NBA fan, or you see this game on sale by some miracle.update 6/19 - still crashing again now. ♥♥♥♥ you 2k.

												MY CAREER ONLY REVIEW ONLYPros:--EDIT: Had to change this section as more crap was changed.  Less pros and more cons I am afraid.--The game is 60% SOLID GOLD when it is not fudging things.  It rewards you for hustle and punishing you for playing stupid D.  That is how it should be every game.  Unfortuately there is the other 40% and makes you want to throw your remote through the monitor.  There is nothing worse than playing a game and feeling like you have no outcome on the results.  Hmm...come to think of it...sounds just like Spike Lee's garbage.  OOPS!  Sorry...that was a rip in the PROS section.  Sorry!--The second season is how the game should be.  You have a lot of options to make money/points.  CONS:--I don't think I have to elaborate much on the utter BS that is Spike Lee.  He makes the first part of the game so painful that I am DREADING having to do it again.  I know you can skip things but you should not have to live through one second of it.  As other says....it's brutal.  What's funny is that if a white person had done this 'first year' he would have been called a racist.  Since it's Spike its ok evidently.  Add to it that you have ZERO control on ANYTHING that happens.....just f-ing brutal.   A cut scene where the parents talk about how they met?  Are you MENTAL?  OMG!!!! Who the SH-T gives a flying f-ck how his parents met?  Seriously?  If I wanted to read that I would steal my wife's romance novels.  STOP THE MADNESS!---The game is 'fixed' to an extent, worse so on the higher difficulties.  If you shoot 65% from the field the Ai will simply 'adjust' the game so that the other team will get multiple offensive rebounds (even if they are the worst rebounding team in the league), have 10+ points more from the free throw line (in one quarter) and of course the old faithful game 'balancer"" the 3 point shot.  Listen, this happens every F-ing game!!!!!  Its not a 'every once in a while' thing...the computer WILL make you miss/turn the ball over/<insert thing you did not do>.--As you play you will be ""throttled"".  In this I mean that in 'real life' the chances of you going 10 for 10 from the field is pretty slim.  Well, this is just a game of code so you WILL be forced to miss shots.  I am ok with missing shots...its just missing the WIDE OPEN LAYUP or DUNK....TWICE IN A ROW....that I can not tolerate.  If you are not throttled there it will happen at the beginning of the game (especially in game 2 or 3 of a playoff series).  You will 'magically' start only making 1 or 2 out of 7 shots.  That happens right? The problem is your shots are of the wide open layup/dunk variety.  I just roll my eyes becuase I KNOW that I will 'struggle with my shot'...and then magically make the next 12!  This exact situation has happened MANY times to the point that I can predict it after 3 shots in the game.  --I duped a guy in the post.  I went up for a layup (not sure why a 7'3"" guy would do a layup when he can DUNK while standing on the floor) and just...missed it.  Can't this happen?  SURE it has happened.  The problem is that it happens EVERY F-ING GAME!  This is 10 fold the story when you play the highest difficulty.  I passed to a streaking Jimmy Butler who was a few feet ahead of his guy...aka a BREAKAWAY.  He could have dunked it with his mouth if he wanted...but he does a layup and almost missed the whole rim.  Why?  We were past the magical number the computer said we could be ahead because it must REMAIN CLOSE!-- By this time last year I had almost 250 hours in game.  This year...pft!  I pick it up once a week, play a quarter, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and then rage off.  Double teaming is worthless for applying pressure.  Its only helps with contested shots.  Pressure, the guy just passes out of it with ZERO problems.  Then I stand in front of the guy I am guarding with my hands up.  He just throws a ball that flies right over my head to the guy under the basket.  The Ai can pass like that all day and there is NOTHING you can do about it.  Steals only happen if you jump the lane...but if you are standing IN THE F-ING LANE the ball goes just in front of your face..and the second guy...and the third...to the one under the basket who will F-ING NEVER miss the shot.  --They adjusted the passing so that if you are in an excellent spot to intercept a pass...and you are not allowed to steal it because the other team is on a run or if you have too many....the pass will move at 3x its normal speed so you are late.  Happens EVERY GAME.  This goes 10x for trying to intercept the ball on the inbounds.  It just simply goes faster so you can't intercept. --They adjusted the game so that if the ball touches ANY PART OF THE OTHER TEAM'S players it you will lose the ball.  Now, this seems to make sense right?  Yes and no.  Yes it makes since but no it does not because IT DOES NOT COUNT AGAINST THE Ai OPPONENT!  You dribble on a guy's foot..turnover (remember, you won't get 90% of loose balls).  The Ai will dribble the ball where it goes THROUGH your HEAD and CHEST as your arm goes through it as you try to steal it.  The ball will then go through the two defenders next to you and they will score.  This actually happens MULTIPLE times EVERY game.  Even had one game Kyrie dribbled through my legs and lost the ball...or so I thought.  It went 10 feet away, changed direction in mid air and then shot back into his hand so he could power dunk on me.  --Went on a run.  Did a pick and roll in which both guys tried to trap me.  Great right?  I bounce passed to the open guy 3 feet in front of the basket.  He catches it and...layup?  No! Dunk? NO!  He gets ready to jump but then just pauses until the defender 10 feet away makes it over.  Then he tries a REVERSE LAYUP...that goes INTO the defender.  This shot got...BLOCKED!  I know!  Shocking!I don't know why I bother playing this game.  I guess its for the 60% solid gold part.  Its the 40% FOOL'S GOLD part that make me quit.  I am quite sad as I know next year will be using 90% of the same code as this year.  It will end up the same and I just can't do this again.  They have lost me as a fan.  :-(			"

Then 2K blocked all the IP from Mainland, China, which meant I would never be able to play the Game online anymore. It sucks.

												I do recommend this game for any basketball fan out there, but NBA 2K16 has its pros and cons. I'll break it down. Pros:-Smoother Animations-Dunk Animations are a lot better-Improved MyCareer-Defense movement has been improved-Rebounding has also improved (Thank God)-Stunning Graphics-Shoe Deals are now gone so now you don't need to wait like 30 games+ for a shoe deal (Thank you lord)Cons:-Frame Rate Issues (Usual with early release games due to NVIDIA Drivers or 2K Sports optimizations not done correctly)-Where are the bonus's from the Pre-Orders?-Animations seem to stutter once in a while-Without the shoe deal, it requires you to purchase them with in game VC (Although this is a lot better than waiting 30 games+ for a shoe deal)-Default graphics processor is Intel's Integrated GPU (WTF?)With all that said,NBA 2K16 isn't a bad game and it's definiately a better basketball simulator than NBA Live series that EA is trying to bring back. It just requires new NVIDIA Drivers or 2K Sports to optimize the game. Gameplay and all is fine. Just the lag is just killing me.			"

												What a piece of junk. -Terrible, cheesy, racist and stereotyped (Thanks Spike) story for Mycareer.-Forced to play 7 meaningless games in high school and college for no VC.-Your player has no choices at all during the story mode-Your rating of 55 when you enter the league makes you an instant scrub, the lowest rated player in the league. -Offensive player movement is lethargic, and you literally stick to the defensive player when you have the ball.-Shooting is hit or miss, literally, even when you execute a perfect release, because they lowered the accuracy     percentage for open 3 pointers-Player avatars are laughable and some bear little resemblance to the real life player.

												Really good game. Make sure you have a controller however.To expand on my review a little bit, 2K has made strides to keep the community happy, while this hasn't always worked, the game keeps its consistency. With other modes then just ""PLAY BEEEBAALL"" like MyGM where you manage a team and can go as far as set ticket prices and keep players happy, to MyTeam which is a mode similar to Madden Ultimate Team where you gather cards to make a team to do challenges to get more cards and virtual currency to spend.I do have one con however, if you're looking for a constant online group to play with, this might not be it. In my own experience I can never get matched with people online, and when I do my connection gets dropped instantly, this includes all online modes such as The Park which is like a free for all basketball mode, allowing you to hop in a street game on command. I'm sure its different if you have friends that are willing to play, however I do not so I have to matchmake.My verdict is 8.9/10Also if you're interested, there is mod support that 2K likes to keep under wraps, check out the NLSC forum for HD mods for players, stadiums, and all other sorts of enhancements.

												Banned for playing the game normally and can't even get a response from customer service. It's a good game, but the multiple bugs related to online and the complete lack of care from 2K is really concerning. They care more about milking people for money from microtransactions than their actual game.			"

												Same crap, different year. For everything 2K fixes, they break another thing. For every feature they add, they remove another. As always with 2K PC ports, you can tell 2K put minimal labor and effort into a proper conversion. Paying full-cost year after year for essentially the same mediocre game has taken its toll on me and I think it's finally safe to say I'm abandoning this franchise.			"

												Pros:- Improved responsivness on defense- Removed some of the cheese from 2k15 (charge cheese and zigzag 27 foot threes)- Improved post play- Off days in MyCareer (ability to get MyTeam cards from MyCareer)- More realistic reboundingCons:- Minor improvement over 2k15 (They were saying that they removed the cheese in 2k16, but they actually created it in 2k15 with Patch #4. 2k15 just needed some sliders tweaking)- Hyped up MyCareer story didnt deliver- Short highschool season (3 games with 2 minute quarters)- Short college season (4 games with 6 minutes halftimes)- Only 8 games in rookie season- Not being able to play on custom designed arena in ProAM- Proam doesnt work most of the time (""Friend has changed park..."")- Blocking is way to easy, even with 6ft pointguard- Stealing is too easy, especially stripping players on fastbreak or under the rim- Big men (PF/C) have no ball protection in the post- Midrange shots go in 90+ % of the time, even with terrible players- Baseline midrange jumpers go in 100% of the time, even heavily contested- Post fadeaway still cheese- Hackers, hackers, hackers (even though they had one attempt of banning them)- People banned because of the developers lazyness (account rollback/reset would make more sense than BAN)- Real hackers still running around hidden as fake 55 overalls- Hackers in MyTeam/Gauntlet that make your game freeze and give you 80-0 loss- ""A problem has been encountered that prevents gameplay from continuing. This game will not be counted."" --> Caused when you press pause in 1st quarter and sometimes caused by CE users. Still rewards a loss even though it says that game will not be counted- Ball tangibility still not good (ball going through players, floating in players hands, ball teleporting dribble)- Poor AI for both your teammates in mycareer and cpu opponents (cpu still more effective because of HoF cheese)- VC harder to earn than in 2k15- Over agressive CPU defense (not that I like last year Nba Jam, but this is way too much)- PnR way too effective- Brick wall knocks down players on every 2 screens- Awkward automatic fadeaway on contested shots that arent that much contested- Barely any graphical improvement over the last year- Performance issues (havent encountered them personally, but many people with high end GPUs have them)- Invisible players in every game mode, even Park/ProAm- Same terrible upgrade system from 2k15 that they tried to ""balance"" adding stat caps. Grouping attributes in categories prevents players from specializing in certain areas and therefore all the players are the same. (cant make a player that is good at freethrows but sucks at 3 pointers etc..)- Inability to configure keyboard controls- Controller settings often reset (boxout assist strength and defensive assist strength)- Took them 10 days to give us our preorder bonuses- Players missing from MyTeam collectionsTo sum up: Definitely not worth the full price. Get it in a month or two after few patches and on some discount.			"

												Online is garbageIf you love the NBA, get the game.If you want pure basketball simulation, do not buy this game.Do not buy this for the story, if you are a 2K fan, if you have a console, get it on there.Because 2K is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥es when it actually comes to the PC crowd, they do not care.I am in EU, so I have to rotate my ♥♥♥♥ing stick around for 5 minutes, or else my main controller will be my keyboard instead.Because 2K are that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that they remove the ability for mulitple controller inputs, so I have to unplug my keyboard if I want to go in and get cheesed in their horrendous MyTeam mode.The MyTeam mode has not changed since it's launch years ago, nothing has really changed in terms of gameplay.Some tweaks there, if you own 2K11 on pc, you could get some mods and get it to look just as good as this.I wanted this game for the online, which I do regret now, I can't play any fun team without facing the ♥♥♥♥ing Cavaliers every game.I just find it annoying that 2K used to be the good guys, like back when ESPN 2K5 football was like 20 dollars when Madden sold for 50, now they are just that bench guy in the NBA who keeps on getting checks even though the person is damn near 40.I hope something changes, I would still not recommend this game to anybody, because the PC version is such an obvious ♥♥♥♥ show like it always is.We are the minority when it comes to money, so they have no care for what we need or want.I have had this controller-lock problem for years, I have contacted Ronnie(♥♥♥♥ you), Chris(you are kind of cool but you seem like a ♥♥♥♥) and 2Ksupport. None of them have resolved the issue, even though I have spammed them and they have passed it on to their subpar devteam.The biggest most marketed feature of the game was the single player, well the first season is just horrible, just skip the cutscenes. It is like He Got Game, just like a thousand times more horrible, whoever even thought that it was a good idea to have a linear storymode be called ""YOUR STORY"" is just dumb.Just another marketing scheme to get the buyers to get it, I can safely say, that I won't invest in any VC or another 2K preorder until things have changed.

 2K abuses their dominance if not their de-facto monopoly on basketball gaming, as they would never dare with their other devs such as Firaxis (civ):    Microtransactions on a fully priced game, intentionally affects pacing: While on the first MyPlayer you make on 2k16/2k15 you will tolerate it, somewhat, any subsequent player will be a total grind if you don't buy VC  Unskippable cutscenes, or cutscenes that need delay before they can be skipped: entering a timeout, exiting it, half time breaks, news cast at the end of the game, etc.  Either you have to wait before skipping, or you can't skip, a nightmare.  Exploitable animations have only been fixed at the time of this review (mid May 16), just an example of the low update rate of this game  POOR PC support, now NBA 2K always disrespected PC, but this is nuts, delayed patches, less care for PC only bugs, and their history of bringing engines late to PC  These are just a small sample, did I say an abusing monopoly?

												Everyone gives this game a lot of negative reviews for basically pointless stuff. I've been playing NBA 2k since 2k11 and I can personally say I've had as much fun now as I did back when I first started. What everyone says about the MyCareer is not FULLY true. Yes the story is boring and pointless, and yes rookie year is a waste. But, after rookie season you are in regular MyCareer and it is actually very fun. There is no more pointless hour long cutscenes, and its basically classic MyCareer. Besides the start of the MyCareer, this is the best basketball game to date. The crowd is amazingly realistic, the graphics and atmosphere is great, and the game runs very well.			"

												This game is mediocre at best. Rebounding works good, thats the only praise I will give this game. Story sucks, character creation sucks, customization sucks, pay too win sucks, gameplay sucks and can be incredibly frustrating to the point of wanting to punch a hole through your monitor or smash your game pad into a thousand little pieces.  Honestly, this game just sucks. Below is what is broken.-CPU STEALS (Good luck dribbling in a straight line, the cheese cpu steals are real with this one, guess how many times cpu gets called for reaching in? NEVER)- ISO MOVES ( Also ties into the cpu cheese steals, I call it the turnover stick now. Even with the absolute setting and a decent playmaking skill half the time you will do a random move and often multiple random moves which results in, you guessed it, turnovers)- SHOT METER ( So you know for a fact you got a perfect release? Well 2k doesnt think so. So many times I've stoped the slider on the left of the bar only for it to magically appear on the right)- USER STEALS ( So youre hand goes straight through the ball and you think you've got yourself a steal? Think again, the cpu steal cheese does not carry over to your abilities, you're more likely to get called for a reach in. Many times the cpu will run right through you and it wont even phase him, you try to do the same? TURNOVER)- CPU DEFENSE ( So you just pulled off a sick spin move without turning the ball over and you're now 6ft away from your opponent with an open lane to the rim? Well too bad! The cpu wizardry will warp the player at light speed and stop you in your tracks mid dribble)- USER DEFENSE ( Good luck playing any sort of relevant defense as a guard if you dont have near max athleticism, you could play defense just as good as the computer but the cpu will most of the time either glitch right through you or run right around you with ease, and good luck getting back on defense if you take one wrong step because youll be stuck there for about 3 seconds)-CPU SHOT SELECTION ( So you just tossed Joakim Noah the ball right on the baseline with an easy driving lane to the hoop and you're wondering what kind of mystical dunk he is getting ready to perform? FORGET ABOUT IT, he's going to stay planted and shoot a fadeaway 12 footer and miss badly, costing you an assist and some points on the board.- TURBO BUTTON ( So you're mashing the turbo button because you see something in the defense you can exploit? Well too bad for you because it will take at least 2 seconds, if at all, before your character decides to start sprinting into a cpu player who wasn't there 2 seconds ago which results in more turnovers. I know I'm forgetting many more flaws.PLEASE, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT SUPPORT THE DEVELOPER WHEN THEY CONTINUE TO RELEASE BAD GAME MECHANICS YEAR AFTER YEAR AND DO NOT RELEASE ANY SORT OF RELEVANT PATCHES. STICK WITH 2K15 OR 2K14 FOR THAT MATTER, AS EVEN THOSE GAMES ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THIS TRASH. DO NOT BE A SUCKER AND WASTE 60$ ON THIS GAME, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. DONT EXPECT TO PLAY ONLINE UNLESS ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS PLAY BECAUSE THIS GAME IS DEAD, MY PARK IS EMPTY. ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO AVERAGE 8 TURNOVERS A GAME WITH YOUR MY PLAYER POINT GUARD.IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING FROM THIS REVIEW IT SHOULD BE DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												A review from the most despised guy on the 2k16 forum right now coming live and free of charge (no VC here) right to you:It's hard to actually find somewhere to start guys and gals because there is just so much wrong with this game. Maybe let's do it bit by bit:General:- good ol' VC is returning and damn it's good to have it back. I so missed flushing 50 bucks down the toilet for a game and then being charged for any and every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t item. The prices have gone up and are now really insane while how much you earn, even on HoF has actually gone down.- lack of technical support makes a return as well. Yeah like always the PC community is again the but of the joke because again we are desperately waiting for technical issues to be solved and are waiting and waiting and waiting. 4 weeks after the pre-release the PS4 patch is out for 2 weeks now and we still haven't seen ♥♥♥♥ or even been given a possible release date.- lack of support also makes a comeback. Yeah for a game that costs you 50 bucks or more you will actually have to wait  up to seven days to even get a random answer which does not relate to your problem at all and which, even when you press them, offers no help whatsoever because they either don't know or they aren't allowed to do anything.- commentary of the game cuts out like every quarter. It's unbearable.- there is a bug that displays players naked or makes the invisible. They are invisible yet they pass, dribble, shoot and score on your ♥♥♥ all day long.- 2k TV regulary crashes the game.- the audience is barely audible. During freethrows and timeouts it's basically like you are playing a pickup team on a farm in Iowa... no sound at all.- you have around 10-20 seconds before the actual timeout screen sets in allowing you to change settings and setups and you can not ever skip those 10-20 seconds. So have fun with that one especially when the stupid A.I. calls 2 timesouts back to back.- basically anything above Allstar Sim is getting close to unplayable because of all the incredible cheese the A.I. pulls off- defensive A.I. of opponent improved while the defensive A.I. of your team is absolute garbage in every situation- still too many animations in which your player gets sucked intoMyCareer:- hyped to no end because it's a Spike Lee Joint and because people were complaining about the player basically being chosen for you (background story and all) they produced a hillarious video in which they claim that you can ""be yourself"" and make your own story. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that one. You play a guy called Frequency Vibrations, I ♥♥♥♥ you not, nickname Freq. This is the name you will be referred to in game even though you have the option to name your player and the announcers will, at random times, call you by it. That no one thought to tell Spike Lee to ♥♥♥♥ off and that not even the actors themselves thought it is beyond stupid that anyone would call anybody Frequency Vibrations is just... well I can't find words for it. You are also forced to be African American because your family is black as is your twin sister and obviously everyone around you apart from some overhyped agent who speaks and acts like it's 1930's Chicago south side and an Asian girlfriend who seems only interested in your money. Yeah... you heard me.- you do not make any decisions in your career until you reach your second year in the NBA. Every cutscene is an overlong piece of film that you are forced to watch (some lasting 10 minutes easy) or skip. You choose no answers, you make no decisions and that stuff is so corny like someone actually tried to make a bad comedy out of ""He got game""- you get to play 3 games in Highschool which last all of 2 minutes per quarter in which you play against dwarfes ( I believe the tallest player might be Tracy McGrady's height and that guy plays center) while you stroll around in your up to 7'3 glory. What a joy. You can do everything, run fast as the wind, shoot threes and what not even though you are only rated 55. Once you get to college the real NBA stuff applies and unless you are buying VC (because guess what you don't earn any in Highschool and College) you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 55 rated player even though you are hailed as the next Madonna or some such.- your first NBA season is 8 games... with a 55 rated player unless you buy VC... yeah what fun. At the end you get to actually go into free agency even though you are a first round rookie so should have at least a 2 year contract plus 1-2 years team option. Oh yeah and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ end to the story happens.MyGM:- legacy issues like having to manually adjust every gameplan instead of the newest global gameplan being taken into account without having to delete the old specific gameplan for a team. broken player promises: even if you kiss the guys ♥♥♥ and do everything he asks you to, he will still return a day later and tell you that you screwed him over and lied to himn and doesn't like you anymore. Guys who put up 0,5 ppg in 1 minute of gametime will come to you asking for a starting spot etc.- no list for team names in relocation so you might end up with a team that has no name the announcers can pronounce- players still develope too fastOnline:- full of cheaters and yes I'm saying that even though I moderate a thread for the CE tables to this game. Funny enough the same ♥♥♥♥ as last year is still working and even more horrendous VC farming is possible. Now 2k swung the banhammer and guess what? Even though lots of people claim that they removed the cheaters, they actually only removed the guys who used VC glitches because of course it costs them actual money ;)Positive:- defensive A.I. seems improved- post game seems improvedEnd of story:As it is it's a pile of garbage. You want to know why? Check above... it's because the devs and producers were busier explaining ♥♥♥♥ that makes up 0,1% of the whole game in dope ♥♥♥ videos than actually improving last years installments. Buy 2k15 or even better... don't support 2k ever again.			"

												I really want to like this game but there's too many problems and when i bought this, i couldn't expect it'd be that bad.1. Spike Lee's my career story can only be described as utter trash.2. Crashes to desktop with no error. Almost everytime i finish a game in my career, the game will ctd with no error. This is not a problem of my computer, if you read other reviews you will notice that its actually a very common problem. Wtf 2K, fix your game before making a new one, you cashgrabbing monkeys! 3. Cutscene simulator. Seriously, i don't want to watch the cutscenes, i want to play the game.4. Microtransactions for my career.5. 2K clearly doesn't care about the negative feedback this game is getting and this is the most annoying thing. Seriously, just take a look around the forums and the reviews and you'll notice a plethora of people complaining about ctd's and bugs. Why do they expect us to buy the next game, if it's so hard for them to release some patches and fix their current game?Still, this game is the best NBA sim on the market and despite its flaws (which are too many) is quite fun, especially (when it doesn't crash) and when playing vs your friends.

												I guess Spike Lee thinks the only people that play this game are urban kids from Harlem. How annoying!!! The story mode is ridiculous. It's called ""Livin Da Dream"" for goodness sake. I understand that may appeal to a particular demographic, but I've been playing 2k for years and it seems I have to go to the ""hood"" and take some vernacular classes to know wtf my character is even saying. It is very frustrating and I figured it would be as soon as I learned Spike Lee was working on this. NOT EVERY NBA FAN IS A HOODLUM. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the fact that my family is black, but could there at least be an option to make them not say things like ""Man dis bout to get twisted, yo!"". Who really talks like that? ♥♥♥♥ing no one, Spike. Livin Da Dream????????? UGGGGHHHH. The actual basketball seems ok so far as long as you don't mind listening to what amounts to a cheesy episode of The Proud Family to get there. Or maybe more like Fat Albert. I wouldn't know becuase I've never watched either of those shows like Spike thinks. ♥♥♥♥ it's frustrating. Why can't I just be white!!!!!! Nobody in production ever said ""Hey Spike, what if someone that isn't black wants to play the game?""			"

												Overall the gameplay is much improved from NBA 2k15(which i put almost 600 hours into) between MYGM, and MyCareer modes. There are more animations and they feel smoother and more realistic. Dribbling and using the right stick to crossover and perform other moves is still very satisfying. The shot meter is back and feels the same helping you to guide shots into the net. Defense even has its own meter that shows how close to the defender you are and how much pressure you are producing on him.  There have been some small control changes since 2k15. Now the face buttons of the controller allow you to perform bounce passes, or lob passes alongside the standard pass. This helps you feel more in control and turn the ball over less. Centers and other big men down low feel more like you are playing their counter parts. Slow, not very good ball handling but big tall bruisers who use their size to their advantage. Defense has been slightly improved and shots are harder to make, as you are less likely to be wide open. This more realistically portrays FG % in the NBA and feels less cheesy online. Graphics are improved as well, with 2k adding in new body scans. Carmelo Anthony now looks substantially different than Lebron James. As mentioned before animations feel smoother and more realistic. I have experienced some crashing issues when in game and navigating menues. There are also some random glitches in game that detract from the overall experience. For example there is a new feature when your my player is subbed into the game.This feature shows the player you are currently guarding or being guarded by. It shows the players strengths and weaknesses. There is a problem that occurs randomly however when the players strengths/ weaknesses never appear and you are stuck looking at a semi frozen image of the player for 30 seconds. After playing last years version im sure the bugs will still be there months later(none are gamebreaking save for the infrequent crashes, just minor annoyances.)There is no ability to configure keyboard controls. 2k literally gave no thought to the PC gamer with this port. Crossfire is terrible but with my one AMD r9 270x i am getting 60 FPS with very little stuttering, so i am pleased with the optimization especially over last years version.There is a wide plethora of game modes in this years game, i have never dabbled in My team because i hate pay to win. But MYGM is fun and feels improved. The real reason i cannot recommend this game at full price is the changes to MYCareer and to be specific the changes directed by Spike Lee. Livin' Da Dream is a joke.You create a character like in past iterations of the gamemode however this time you dont get to choose a nickname because that persona has already been created for you. Spike Lee has dubbed your character Frequency Vibrations or Freq for short, sex toy or porn star either way the name is terrible. The story revolves around your character and his family, you are born into a african-american family with an african-american twin sister. If the story following all this was actually good and well written than maybe i could excuse my white character who looked totally out of place and confused as to why his mom had never told him who his real father was. Honestly its not a big deal, things like this have happened to other races and games in the past and i could get over it, the problem is the story is absolutely terrible. The story revolves around your friend VIctor Van Lier who is supossed to be a bad influence on you and you are warned multiple times by the team owner, your twin sister, and your characters girlfriend who comes out of nowhere sometime in college.   You dont get to make any choices about how your story unfolds besides the choice of High schools (1 of 3) and choice of colleges (1 of 9). The story is so melodramatic, people arguing over your image or multiple refrences to friends and family using you as a meal ticket. Choices of team do not affect the story any. Minor details like your characters celebratory dance ""freaking and vibin"" as well as interviews of family and friends during the cutscenes do nothing to add anything to the terribly written farse that is Livin' Da Dream.  Spike Lee seems to believe that people from Harlem have the same terrible vernacular that he embodys in his titles. This terrible story mode takes away your rookie season as well, which is something that 2k really seems to enjoy in MYCareer the last two years. You get to play 3 Highschool games where your character is truly OP and 4 college games but not earn any VC for them as well as not be able to change the game lengths. Your character than is forced to be a one and done player and go to the NBA draft with an overall rating of 55, which is terrible. You are heralded as a top 10 draft pick, i went number 7 but the other players selected around that time are 77-78. By design 2k makes you either a terrible player or have to open your wallet just to keep up. Your rookie season is only 8 games (instead of the 82 in a real NBA season) with Spike Lee's terrible 20 minute cutscenes in between. Also you can change the Freq nickname after your rookie season but for some reason announcers/ pre game show will still sometimes refer to you as Freq. After your rookie season MyCareer returns to its roots allowing you to play any games along the season you would like while also introducing a new days off feature and allowing you to select whether or not to go to a ""Live practice"" or hang out with teamates/fellow Nba players or go do endorsement deals. This is where MyCareer should have started. ""Live Practices are fun and really the draw in this mode is building a character and watching his career progress rather than slated cutscenes of melodrama.  Somewhere along the way this mode lost all its basing in realisim as well because after your first season the team owner realeases you to go into Free Agency where you can choose three teams that have varying levels of interest in your sevices and negotiate Money and minutes. I think Spike Lee tries to rationalize it with your friend Victor causing you to get fired. Honestly though has anyone ever heard of a top 10 pick being dropped because of a friends actions? Spike Lee just took the easy way out as he did with most of the other parts of this mode. Tldr: Really i cant recommend the game even though gameplay is so much better and graphics improved because of how much the Mycarrer mode has declined. I still find ways to enjoy the game, but get it on deal since this is turning into a yearly cash cow akin to EA's.			"

												NBA 2k16 has incredible graphics, gameplay is generally very smooth, and server performance is vastly improved from recent years.  However, there are an insane amount of small issues that add up and these have all been here since release, that makes gameplay very frustrating.  Many features are incomplete, or just dont work.  Directional passing for example, there is no way to pass to a player behind another player without manually selecting that player and allowing the defense time to react.  every second counts in basketball.  VIP Stats (their online stats program) shows in depth tendencies and stats about the opponent you play at the loading screen, but there is no way to see any stats besides PPG and Win/Loss for your own profile, when they obviously have the information available to them. Whenever a stoppage of play occurs there is a period of time where you are stuck just watching a cutscene, no matter how badly you want to skip, you cannot.  This happens at literally every single stoppage of play, and for me is the most infuriating part of the game when I am trying to play a fast paced game.Play Now Online allows players to choose their own jersey before they match up with another player, so if a player chooses a white home jersey before they match up with me, gets the Away team, and then doesnt change their jersey I will have no idea that he is using a white jersey instead of what should be a colored jersey since he is the Away team.  This means both teams in game have nearly identical jerseys and the game is so frustrating to play when you have to really stare to see who is on which team in transition.MyGM and MyLeague have a multitude of options, but lack very basic NBA rules such as the veterans minimum, and protected picks, the latter completely destroying any hopes of a MyGM or MyLeague with the Lakers without cheating and force trading their top 3 pick.   You can sign Steve Nash for 725k or so but in real life he cannot be paid less than $1.49m if he were to sign a contractAt times gameplay AI seems random, for example there seems to be a 50% chance that on a transisition you pass the ball to your teammate he will either stand still and catch it or keep running and theres no way to know what will happen.  On offense the AI actually sometimes feels like it is rigged against you, with your players playing either unrealisticly or flat out refusing to obey controller commands.   Example:  shooters that have a wide open 3 go inside the line and when I try to get them to go behind the line (and this has happened many times for me), they literally just wont go behind the line I dont get it. Defensive AI feels the same way.  Double team is set to manual but they still decide to leave their 3pt shooter wide open to double team someone who doesnt need to be double teamed, and wasnt told to double team2K puts no effort in updating hairstyles of players, with the majority of players having the same hair they had in summer 2015 when they got scanned, and there have been lots of changes during the season.  Allen Crabbe is one example thats not even close to real life anymoreMyCareer is terrible the first season is garbage the High School and College experience comes off as annoying and tedious since none of it matters at all there is no story that changes its the same thing every time, so after youve made your first player its just annoying to go thru it all over again to get to NBA.Cannot stress how bad MyCareer is we were told that we were going to Be The Story, and that couldnt be farther from the truth.  Its Freq's Career by Spike Lee for the entire first season, you only get to play 8 rookie games!!Every single game of Online play you will have to change your settings, they just do not save and there is no way to get them to default to something else.  This functionality does not work and has not worked for years.  It even changes the camera angle so if you dont get the first possession you have to play in Broadcast mode until you get the ball. In MyGM, MyLeague, and MyCareer, your gameplay settings (length, difficulty, sliders) all have to be set every single time you make a new franchise/career no matter what the default settings are.  The default settings seem to only make a difference in Play Now offline. Getting locked in animations.  Just ridiculous there are so many long animations in this game ESPECIALLY after scoring a bucket and celebrating your opponent can run the ball up court while you watch your player dancing and celebrating in the backcourt.   Just terrible.  Awful.   My controller actions are not suggestions they are commandsIf your controller gets disconnected during online play, you cannot reconnect it under any circumstances and have to restart 2k in order to be able to play it further.  This will always result in a loss unless its late in the game and you have a comfortable lead and waste the clock playing with your keyboard.  But idk even 1 control for thatMyCareer doesnt allow Draft classes.  cant think of any reason to not include this.  It also doesnt allow GM sliders so the trades and Free agency are unrealistic in MyCareer modeOverall this is a very good basketball game, but the tiny problems make it infuritating to playAs we unfortunately have to ask every single year in the 2k community, PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME			"

												I was so excited that they got a director to do the My Career this year, i saw it was Spike Lee.I just have to say that the My Career storyline was a good effort but sucked either way. Its like watching a cheap drama indie film. Ok so this review is more about the My Career mode so lets see some pros and cons.Pros- 1) Cinematic Experience  2) Tiny bit of character development 3) Engaging start ( the highschool-college thing was great and authentic)Cons- 1) If you aint black you will find it weird since you are born in a black family with a black twin. Now  thats not a huge problem but it destroyes the beliveabilty of the game and the connection you feel with the player.2) The bugs/crashes and VC missing have been fixed but still its not excusable for a big company to make such mistakes while asking for full price.Do not buy the game yet. Wait for a patch and even then give it a second thought			"

												Best basketball sim on the market... but mainly because NBA Live sucks that much. NBA 2k16 gets revised controls, slightly better graphics, and a new story mode. If you've played an NBA 2k game in the past you know what you're getting into. Sadly, this includes a lot of the AI frustrations you come to expect. Instead of playing intelligent AI the way 2k  ramp up difficulty is making you miss dunks, layups and making the computer intercept passes like crazy. Tough to recommend due to the poor AI, but then again what choice do you have as a basketball gamer? Also, who wants to see all those useless inbounding and timeout animations? Everyone is just tapping A like crazy to try and skip it... Also where is the ability to save different GM files? The new story mode has such a long and boring beginning it's hard to get into as well. Maybe I'm just being old and grumpy, but the 2K series is getting too cinematic for its own good. How about 2K focus on making the core basketball gameplay better and get rid of the fluff.			"

												Preface this: Been buying and playing NBA2K since the beginning... And 5 years straight on Steam. I put in hundreds of hours each year. I love NBA2k. But......This is the worst one. Ever. That's really all I can say. I really don't want to go back to NBA Live (hey that was the only option back in the day) but this PC launch is rough. Buggy. The menus werent ported, no proper key binding, a painfully awkward career mode where my bench player is a superstar... The awkward key assignments... ...How do you manage to actually REMOVE menu options from one year to the next? ...And I have to ask... wtf is that intro movie with the cartoon characters? Outsource your intro? I love NBA2K, but this is sad. I was so pumped at the prospect of playing highschool, college then going pro... but this untested, unoptimized, poorly ported mess is the most dissapointing basketball game I've played in a decade... And that makes me really sad... Patch this 2K. In the meantime I'm going to go checkout your competition because clearly the PC market isn't worth your time.			"

												so I play the 2k series since nba2k8.I say this first before i'll write my review, i keep playing this game most likely.So i start with the Pro's first-Great Graphics, awesome faces etc-mycareer,myleague,mygm and myteam are nice and well done-it runs very smoothly on my rigso cons, well where do i start ?Lets just start with animations, while animations on its own are sick and look awesome, Ingame they are a pain in the ♥♥♥!You'll get stuck in movements you don't press. while my PG is a 89Rating, he seems to forget sometimes how to dribble(which is weird with playmaking above average). Passing is pretty easy, but sometimes the players are getting into a movement right before you pass, those passes fly anywhere but not to a teammate( it seems to me this happens because the game has overall big problems with input lag). Input lag is annoying af, i tested it now on several configurations and two different rigs, as well 4 different controllers. Its always there and always affecting things on court.If you're an attacking pg, this game hates you then, while you drive to the basket and have a path like moses, everybody on the opponent team will catch you( not matter how fast you are)i witnessed it a lot that a sf or sg just kinda teleported to me and blocked me, while i was getting stucked in some weird layup animation i did not choose(i have the steph curry layup pack, which rarely applies). Big no go is also defense. Enemy Teams always defend like pros (which is actually nice and challanging)BUT your Team defend like a new born child, this is especially in mycareer annoying. Im sure that withour those animation stucks and rigged scores this game would make actually a lot of fun, ofc the input lag should be fixed(this seems like its pc only, as i watched many youtubers and streamers and they never really had it)one thing to the mycareer, while i like the idea its poorly made! hey they got spike lee and some actors WoW! the story is boringand never really interesting, also never really a surpise whats happening( besides the talk that im a superstar when i only play 12 min per game(12min qtr). its way to short as well.so this game seems to be only for addicted nba dudes like me, new guys wont like it. the controlls are way do difficult. and no help for new guys when they start a career or do something else, they have to search for help(yeah i know tutorials are boring but for new players in this type of a game, needed badly)my final conclusion is:if you love the nba and the nba2k series you most probably already have it, if not you may pass on, on this one.its way better then nba live(which tbh is not very hard)but since they got ""next gen"" it did get more and more a type of game that looks and plays awesome for the first 2 weeks, but if u know more of it and understand everything it starts to fall apart. i have also a lot more i could go on about but those things are in the series forever so i do not believe they fix it ever.ps i forgot about mypark:mypark is kinda fun but on pc their're a lot of cheated players (99ovr) which are mostly pretty bad but a lot of 2v2 groups are out there cheating their ways to the top. Also a lot of ballhogs and wannabe kobes,lebrons,kds,mjs. "

												Not until the bugs are settled. It's strange how other games play perfectly with no need to fiddle with the video settings , while 2k is beyond a mess. The breif moment I was able to play the game with sound was great. Pretty much binged played MyCareer. The story was a bit much , but it was pretty fun when the game worked (that one time). Ever since I had to update / uninstall anything to see if this game would work like it did before. 2k release a patch please!!			"

												I have played almost every NBA 2K game thats been sold, but this year I can't even bring myself to play against this year's ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ cheating AI, ♥♥♥♥ so annoying being up 10 and suddenly your defense just stops defending or you stop making open shots, while they drain contested up the ♥♥♥ 3's. This year is not simulation AT ALL, this year the AI will handicap you to make the game play the way they want, pretty much scripted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it doesn't matter how well your rotations are or how good you are at shot releases, made and missed buckets are based on some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t momentum system, its simply impossible to score 2 jumpshots in a row even with the likes of Curry.Before anyone questions my skill lvl, I've reached GOAT league on online play like it was nothing with 100-20 record, and msot of those losses came from invisible players or early in the game, I know how to use freelance and zone defense to shut down the paint or perimeter, but none of that ♥♥♥♥ works against the CPU, it doesn't matter how good you are on your rotations in defense and if you have your hand in their face, they will make the shot if they haven't made, say their last 2-3 shots, complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this year, and completely unplayable for me, which is why I've stuck to online play for a while until there is a patch to fix this ♥♥♥♥.

												This is my review of NBA 2k16(aka Skinner Box Simulator 2k16). I think NBA 2k is consistently the only worthwhile basketball title every year.  I love it mostly. But I was unable to even connect to this offerings server. It also follows a sad precedent that appears to be taking hold in the video game industry, especially in the regurgitated yearly sports titles. I named myself B F Skinner and wanted to get online in 2k almost as a ironic statement of protest, but wasn't able to. Back in the days, a guy named BF Skinner put hamsters in a box and studied their reward response through a small lever and a treat that was dropped upon pressing it. He figured out that when they press it and instantly receive said reward, they will eat the treat and lie down. But when the reward was randomly dropped they would continuously press the button to exhaustion. This is the basic underlying element of MyTeam. If you don't believe it, watch any of the pack openings on internet video sites. What you are witnessing is the highs and lows which stimulates the brains chemical response mechanisms. When the user taps the button(buying packs) he will repeatedly get cards he doesn't like leading to depression/frustration. When a gold/whatever other stupid color special card drops, they jump all over the place with glee, brains flooding with endorphines. This is troubling if one understands the mechanisms which are involved, considering real money is being spent. Seems to closely resemble the same involvement of drug abusers and their crack of choice. If doubles where eliminated, or if VC was more readily attainable, I guess it would seem more acceptable. It also seems to be marketed directly to minorities, which is another thing that may or may not be okay to you. I have also seen that when one shows a willingness to spend money, your myteam players seem to perform worse then they should. I can recall in 2k15, getting Steph Curry(Mr three ball cheese) and lighting it up with glee. All of a sudden he's hitting 2-30. Same with KD. etc etc. ""Gotta get more packs,,,, Next one is Mike,,, 50 dollars,,, just one more,, awww kostas kodsafjiosdfjioasdg? Emerald Dirty Ballscamp??? Double, double, double,  C'mon!"" <-- sound familiar? You've been gamed, boys and gals. Next time you needs a sammich, think of all the gold cards you can't sell. This may or may not be okay to write, as I'm sure this is not the info that peeps want you to hear. Could possibly get the business for sharing it. But they don't teach B F Skinner usually. I'm sure some may know, but it feels wrong when others are fleeced for their dollar and coin. Buy a game with some integrity, which actually has value, made by people interested in putting out a quality product. People who value your business, and respect your intelligence. Less taking selfies with millionaire b-ballers, less cute spokesmodels, less ""oh snap, a penny!"" <lunges to the floor to grab>. More community support, more involvement in production, more beta testing, more originality. An added bonus would be to consider the fact that the people you are taking money from are human, and may or may not be able to afford your digital heroin. Just my two cents. Honestly, I loved this game for years. Just feels so wrong on so many levels. My recommendation, skip it until they decide to make changes. This is the only way change happens. You keep forking over your dollars, it will keep getting worse.  "

												There are mixed reviews for this game, but now that it's on sale (as of Mar 16), I feel obligated to leave a review for those who may be thinking of buying. Ultimately, if you love the game of basketball, you should get this game right now. Notes on MyCAREER:- There are a &#$^ ton of people giving it negative reviews solely because of the subpar MyCAREER story, but if you can look past that it's still a solid basketball game. - highschool + college years are really fun albeit short- your MyCAREER players all share the SAME appearance that you define in the myPlayer menu, so you can change it at will if you wish (differs in height depending on your position)- You can keep playing with your MyCAREER player after you finish the main story, and even use your player for MyPARKNotes on MyPARK: - If you're planning on playing this mode, I have found from personal experience that the Sunset Ballers is the most populated with more active players.- You do NOT need to spend money on VC to be able to play well - Sometimes you'll come across players who won't play with you or drop out when you enter a court queue because you have a low rating -- don't let this discourage you just keep looking and you'll find some nice players who will play :)- Not sure if this is the case for everyone, but there is a tiny button delay; just be aware of it --  Also if you find that your controller disconnects when you enter a game, try restarting your game in Steam Big Picture modeMyGM: - Many sliders and options to pla around with to manipulate your team's playstyle- Enough control- Stat-heavy if you're into that9.5/10			"

												Carrer mode is awful. Seriously, Spike Lee made everything worst, the story is total bs and full of cliché. I've skipped half of film sequences because I really had enough of that ♥♥♥♥. It's boring, and stupid, and useless. And it's strictly scripted. It's a movie and has nothing to do with a videogame. F%uck  Spike Lee.Gameplay has worsened, shooting is inexplicably harder (even if the player is alone) and passing is inaccurate (half of the time it will launch the ball across the court when you were looking for the guy near to you).

												The MyCareer gets boring at times and its the only game mode that I really like.It left the immersive side of 2k15:-no more interviews after the game (at least for your player)-no more talking with your teammates other than practice with them which is not really that immersive-the introduction of all-stars is still not enough for you to get hype of (I mean come on its the weekend!)-I can't see the social media even if you can edit your social ID (you can't view the reactions of your fans)-the connections are boring (I expected cutscenes but was disappointed)-the free agency is boring without interaction from your agent-no more cutscenes from free agency-the team manager is also non-existing after the first season-you don't even have the time to visit your family on summer-no summer camps which is really really important to add immersion for the next seasonI mean they added the wishlists from last year such as the jersey pick and such but they removed the other immersive stuffs like WTF?

												If you have 2K15, don't buy this at all. Whatever mode you want to play, 2K15 is better.The gameplay is worse this year, and sticky defense comes back with a vengence. You can't even take 5 steps without the defense bodying you up.Worse than that, turbo is broken. Players who are slower are catching faster players regardless of attributes, and everyone can defend like Scottie Pippen 1v1, regardless of attributes. Not a fun experience.MyCareer sucks badly. I got tricked into buying the game because of the so called story, but there isn't one. It's the same  damn thing as 2K15. Essentially your entire rookie season is condensed into a cutscene where you watch stuff happens, stuff that you won't ever do. Also, no more custom nicknames, you're stuck with Freq. Forever.Online takes the cake, though. Cheaters are rampant, and the people who ends up banned are the ones like me, people who accidentally discover bugs in the game and report them. I got banned for simming games, trying to upgrade my MC.PC support sucks. XBone and PS4 already got patch 2, and not even a mention of PC.Don't buy it. Don't even accept it as a gift. If you get it as a gift, trade it in for store credit and go buy a decent game instead. Fallout 4 looks to be decent, grab that.			"

												To add-on to many of the other reviews.  The whole ""Livin Da Dream""  Is a complete waste.  While some aspects are nice, I.E free agency and player interactions after year one.  All in all not worth the time.  People want to play ""themselves"" not You cookie cutter version of what a nba phenom should be.  Gameplay is ok, player movements are still clunky to say the least but its the best out.  One thing that is still frusterating but will not change is the pay to win approach.  Gone are the days were you played games and practiced to improve and build your character.  I would be lying if it didnt feel like the certian ""speed bumps"" in gameplay werent introduced to nudge you towards spending more.  Servers have always been an issue with online play, so wont beat that dead horse.  My franchise is fun but again, C.R.E.A.M.  money = wins.  Hope this helps.  Dont get me wrong NBA2k is the best basketball game out right now...and the only one so.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but it's just not fun. 2k forgot that it's a game, myplayer is rubbish, the story detracts from the experience I was hoping for. You have a choice of where you go to college but thats it and after the rookie nba season (8 games) you have a few vc to spend on attributes to go from useless to still useless. Effectively you start the game with a skill level that would not get you signed with any pro team in any league anywhere in the world, let alone the nba. You're to slow, cant pass, can't shoot and can't play D. The controls feel sluggish compared to 2k15. It might become fun sometime but I don't think I'm willing to put the ""work"" in because unlike previous games it's not enjoyable. Back to 2k15 for me.			"

												Mycareer mode story is not even close to as imersive or nice as 2k15. You can select a nickname after your first season, but you will still be called Freq. The story has no choices until second season of pro, at which the game is the same choices as 2k15. The main character is likeable, but most of the side characters are not. Your best friend is an unlikeable jerk, your manager a stereotype, the owner is the devil, your twin sister and parents may or may not match your skin color(honestly those characters are cool), and the girlfriend is kinda just there. The Mycareer mode now has game days and offdays, which is a nice change added to break up games. The new way to get upgrades by consistently going to practice on off days is also nice. You can also see upcoming endorcement offer to plan accordingly. All in all improvement from 2k15. This is also the only not online gamemode I have played.The online is full of blantent hackers who get away with murder. If you want to fight them legit, be prepared to farm all the badges and atribute points you can. They seem to not be doing anything to stem the flow of hackers. I had personal issue with their customer support taking forever to reply and giving me the run around, until eventually saying they can't do anything. At least the courts are nice to look at. Between the Rough Riders, Flyers, and Ballers, only the ballers court seems to stay full.Gets 6/10 for Bad online and mediocre story, but extra points for trying to improve. Do not buy on PC if you plan on playing legitly online. If you plan on playing by hacking, please unplug you computer and walk away.			"

I'm mostly an online player and sadly online is not fair on PC unless you want to resort to cheating, just like 2k15 it seems as if 2K just doesn't care. If you are interested in only playing modes such as MyGM then go ahead and buy it, but if you are interested in playing online I would reccomend getting this game on a console.			"

												This game is utter ♥♥♥♥. Seriously, it is one of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had the displeasure to have. The controls are completely unresponsive, as in you just can't dribble the ball to the direction you want to go. Almost every time you try to change direction or a crossover move, not only does it take more than 1 second for your player to respond, you're either gonna bounce the ball off of the defender or he's just gonna stop you and you'll be stuck in a stupid animation where even if you're pressing to go forward the controlled player is just going to stop. 9 times out of 10 you're unable to get by the defender. I've had situations where I had Russell Westbrook with the ball and I couldn't drive by Jose Calderon. Yes, Russell Westbrook can't get by Jose ♥♥♥♥ing Calderon in this game. Now, I've been playing basketball simulation games since NBA Live 07 and NBA 2K8. I'd like to think myself as a decent player. In NBA 2K16, however, no matter your skill you are going to have a bad time scoring.And defense. Don't even get me started on defense. You'd think you would be able to defend the AI, since it can lock you down no matter what. But, of course, that's not the case. Unresponsive is the defining word of this game. It only takes one change of direction, one little crossover for the AI to get by you. Seriously, your controlled player takes around 3 seconds to change direction, so you just get left behind almost every time in defense. The AI just effortlessly gets by you.The AI is terrible, and in MyPlayer your teammates' AI is even worse. They often pass the ball to you at the worst time, lose the ball in a stupid way or try to do a tough fadeaway shot when they're being guarded by 3 defenders while you and the rest of your team is wide open. They NEVER box out, and there are times where you literally have to guard everyone in the court only to see your teammates allow an offensive rebound and easy score for the opposing team.The game forces you into the worst animations possible, making you miss the easiest shots possible.I could go on about the terrible Spike Lee story and dozens of other issues, but you got the picture. This game sucks. Don't waste your money on it. ♥♥♥♥ 2K Sports.			"

												Supposedly one of the greatest sports game in history is actually one of the most bs games in 2k history. Controls are all changed from what everyone is used to. The pick and rolls are now even harder to perform as the center or power forward takes a while to get into position or sets a screen for only a miniscule of a second. Shooting is disgusting because even the tiniest bit shy off of a perfect release or over would result in a miss, even in a situation where it's the most wide open shot. Passing is the same as usual, you try to pass to one guy but will pass to someone all the way across the court. Zig zag cheese is not gone as the CPU now zig zags you into their picks. In conclusion, the new mechanics of the game is what is actually ruining the gameplay and improvement was mainly focused on the different modes rather than gameplay itself.			"

												First and foremost: They gameplay is awesome and anyone who loves basketball will love NBA 2K16.So why would I NOT recommend this game?Publisher 2K simply doesn't care about its community enough. The MyTeam Domination mode is not working for pc players for about 2 weeks now because of a problem on 2K's side. There is 0 information on if or when it is going to be fixed. 2K won't even admit publicly that there is a problem in the first place. The support team is unable (or unwilling) to help and the community management absolutely fails to communicate with the player base. And that's only the icing on the cake. Since the beginning, there are a lot of cases of players losing their MyCareer character because of a corrupted safe file and not getting any compensation even if they bought their VC with real money or heavy lag online which basically persists since NBA2K13.So sadly I can absolutely not recommend NBA 2K16 even though it is an incredibly fun game simply because 2K gives a ♥♥♥♥ about its playerbase.

I'm writing this on the official release day of 9/29/2015 and STILL have no bonus content. Has anyone who preordered this got their bonus content? If so, how?PC optimization is also bad, I have a GTX 970M that can run Witcher III on medium ~40-50fps, I can't run this mess on medium everything without stutter that's killing my eyesGameplay-wise the dribbling feels much better, more fluid and elusive. The quick substitution feature is weird. Why is MyCareer so strange this year? It seems like you can't make any off-court choices that influence the cutscenes!! The story has no impact to me not only because I'm not from Harlem but also because developements just seem to appear from nowhere!! When did I get a girlfriend? Why is my best friend such a bum? When did I pay my lawyers to bail out my bum friend? WHY IS THE ROOKIE SEASON ONLY 8 GAMES LONG??? Why is myPlayer only rated 55 but is a top ten draft pick???Overall I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it until they fix the optimization.			"

Don't buy this game !First off, this game is buggy as hell and poorly optimized for PC but that isn't even why you should't buy this game... You shouldn't buy it because after hours of playing, you will get hit with an awesome bug that won't allow you to connect to some 2k servers and you'll lose all your saves. And reinstalling the game won't do it. Checking the game cache integrity won't work either. And don't lose your time trying to contact 2k support as it is inexistant... I would advise you to buy a game that isn't as buggy and unfinished. It shouldn't be too hard to find a game less buggy than this one ;-)			"

												This is an EXACT clone to 2K15 - the gameplay has changed ZERO.  You still miss every shot, you still drop rebounds, you still get 99% of your passes stolen, you still get dominated in MyTeam and it is impossible to have a good roster to even compete at the start of the game unless you pay about 50 bucks and buy cards.They did NOTHING to improve the gameplay AT ALL from last year.  All the crappy things you were hoping they would fix, well, they didn't.The whole Spike Lee movie thing gets boring very, very, very fast and the lines and scenes are embarrassing at best.

												Worst NBA 2K Game EVER! I don't even know where to start from. It's like they made this game just to irritate you. They have eliminated every element of fun. Playing defense is pointless at times, especially when you are above at the scoreboard and the opponent starts scoring like crazy when the game moves to its end. You can't drive to the basket without getting blocked. Centers make stupid moves at the post, just to get blocked.Games almost never irritate me, though this game never failis to make me mad every time I play.And this started last year. Up to 2k14, there were never issues like these.Moreover, the multiplayer is useless, as there is so much lag you have to completely readjust your gameplay.			"

Do not buy if you only play MyCareerComing from a longtime 2K Sports fan, I have mixed feelings on this entry of NBA2K. However, just because I have it not recommended I suggest you read the entire review to see if you would like it.I am not going to get into day one issues like crashes, bugs, and server issues because frankly basing a review off that this early before they can fix things is stupid. But there are issues I PERSONALLY have with the game. But I'll say a few things this game offers over 2K15 first.ProsImproved animations definitely.Finally readded create-a-team for MyGM, MyLeague, MyTeam, and other online modes. (And its actually really good)Tattoos are freaking amazing and you can place them all over your body.These were a few off the top of my head I was pleased with.The IssueHowever, as I mentioned before I had a huge gripe with this game. In my personal opinion they seem to have taken a step back when it comes to MyCareer. Others apperently like it but I was extremely disappointed by the fact the ""story"" was stereotypical, thoughtless and not enjoyable. I expected more from Spike Lee & 2K. So with giving us an actual story (if you want to call it that) they severely limited how we can play. This isn't OUR story. It is Freq's story. Yes the protagonist has a name and even if you had a simple name like Joe Johnson they will still say Freq regardless. You do not have a choice to be called something else like in previous MyCareers (my personal choice was ""Silky"" Johnson) If you want to play a white, asian, hispanic or really any race that isn't black you have to suspend your disbelief that your family is black and you are not. To make matters worse you have a fraternal twin sister so you really cant think your mom cheated on your dad either. You can't win Rookie of the Year because you can only play a few games in your rookie season. The ""story"" is insanely short, badly written, predictable, pointless and a waste of time. They took away more of our choices and options so they could waste our time with that?You may be saying, but wait! Didn't they let you play through high school and college? That sounds fun. At first yes it was interesting to just destroy the high school competition and finally see some college basketball, but its exactly the same as a normal game just reskinned. You only play a few games of high school and a few of college then you get drafted. And after a handful of years MyCareer has been out, THEY STILL HAVENT ADDED A REACTIVE DRAFT. Meaning if you get drafted first, guess what? The Timberwolves get two number one picks. You and Karl Anthony-Towns. So the draft is basically pointless because it's always the same even though you are in it no matter what your position is. Sucks for you if you play PF and you get drafted first because you're gonna share minutes with a guy who shouldn't even be on the team. Teams won't draft based on needs either apparently, in fact its hard to say for sure what they'll draft on. But if you're a center for example expect Detroit, Utah, Sactown, and Orlando to want to draft you even if they have a franchise center because why not. Same for playing any other position, they will draft you regardless. They should have just placed the MyGM/MyFranchise draft AI into MyCareer so we could get SOME chance of being surprised even if they arent that great as well.Once the story ends, its basically MyCareer as last year.I feel so ashamed of 2K and Spike to have made this game mode such a huge selling point of the game. If you are considering getting the game because of MyCareer, do not get the game.If you don't care about MyCareerThe other gamemodes are solid, if you can can see past the cheesers, hackers, etc in online modes you'll have a lot of fun in ProAm, MyTeam and other game modes. Personally I play mostly MyLeague/MyGM and I enjoy it throughly even though I was hyped to play MyCareer. The relocation aspect of MyLeague/GM was sorely needed in previous entries and they finally added it and its actually good and not bare bones. You can upload images to use as the team's logo, court logo, advertisements, arena name. You can edit the court exactly how you want it, all black if you want to. You can also do this in online modes, create your own team and court which is what it needed. The animations are fluid and smooth. They changed the passing mechanics a bit and a few of the controls so it's an adjustment. Still slightly disappointed that 2K still hasnt revamped the draft prospect aspect of League/GM because its still extremely generic. They could at least pull a Madden and give the prospects a storyline and allow us to actually grow attached or get hyped for a prospect. I was also going to say they could give the random generated prospects faces but they still use the team jersey portraits (say if you trade Damian Lillard it changes from showing his real life counterpart to some nasty ultra low settings doppelganger) so there goes that. Overall however, aside from MyCareer its what you can expect from a yearly sports game release.			"

												Really disappointed in the MyCareer mode, which is the only mode I played in this and 2k15.  It is a huge regression from last year for a number of reasons due to the way the story was put in place.  The biggest issues:1)  In your rookie NBA season, you only play 8 games.  After those 8 games, you move on to your sophomore season where you can then play a full 82 game season.  At this point, the game has sent players all over the place in free agency, so the teams are totally different than what they will be this season.  So for instance, I cannot play more than 8 games without Tim Duncan retiring.2)  The story is really stupid and feels forced upon you.  ""The team isn't sure about signing you because you are friends with Vic.""  Are you kidding?  And no matter how well you play, you get this way over-dramatic storyline that detracts from simply being a rookie trying to make it in the NBA.3)  There just simply isn't enough content in this game that responds to how you play in your games.  There were plenty of cut scenes in 2k15 that would cater to your performance.  For instance, the coach would call you in and congratulate you for your rebounding effort or how you distribute the ball to your teammates.  In this game I haven't seen any of that (though maybe I just haven't played long enough to see it).  All of the cut scenes in 2k16 play out just like a movie (a downright terrible one).  I play games for an immersive, interactive experience where my play affects the outcome.  This game is not that at all.			"

The game stutters a lot, the audio bug is back and strong, the parcs are empty or filled with 99 overall players, and they want to make us buy VC ?

												Don't buy this game in its current state, it is ♥♥♥♥ing broken. I haven't had to deal with such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t since BF4. This game has a cliched story to go along with MyCareer from a mediocre at best director, Spike Lee. The story is the polar opposite of what MyCareer is suppose to be; its not your ♥♥♥♥ing story. They should change their slogan from ""Be The Story"" to ""Be Spike Lee's Slave"". The gameplay isn't bad, but it is definitely rage inducing at times. The defenders stick to you like glue, then you can't guard for ♥♥♥♥. Your teammates are ♥♥♥♥ing useless, they just stand there and when they get the ball they can't make a damn shot. It seems like no matter if you play the Sixers or Cavs the other team is just made up of juggernauts. If you play MyCareer, you're teammates are ballhogs who can't shoot or defend, and in MyTeam you entire team is just ♥♥♥. The gameplay throughout all gamemodes is obvioulsy scripted, but the worst part about all of this is just how much 2K doesn't care. They took the money and ran, but what's new? An American company butt♥♥♥♥s the consumers again, what a surprise. Getting caught up in the hype, I preordered the damn game thinking it will be different this time, I was wrong. I normally wouldn't preorder a game, after this game I am staying true to that. If 2K would just patch the game(it would be quite a large patch) everything would be good because that means that they are finally listening to the consumer, something that is rarely done nowadays. Save your money, do not invest.TLDR; The game is ♥♥♥♥, don't buy it.***I WILL UPDATE IF ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE***			"

												Every year, basketball games like to brag about how much smoother and more fluid the game is. I think this is the first time it was very clear that a lot of things did improve. This is quite honestly the best basketball video game I have ever played.I haven't run into many performance issues, and the game runs much smoother for me at even higher settings than 2K15. Your mileage may vary, though. This game was designed with a controller, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a keyboard. The pro stick (RS) is essential to playing this game, and keyboards just won't offer you the same level of control.Most of the game modes in this year's game are pretty much similar to last year, but with more meat. In MyGM and MyLeague You can now relocate your team if you wish, and your owner can now give more dynamic goals (in GM). Also, AI logic is heavily improved and makes building a perfect team much more challenging, if not impossible. MyLeague also now has an online mode where you can play a League with your friends, similar to The Association Online from a few years back. MyTeam, along with the game modes present in the previous year, also has a new game mode called the Gauntlet, which is a 3 vs. 3 game against other MyTeams.The game now also has more online features than ever. MyPark makes a return from last year, which is pretty much the same, but now you also have a customizable MyCourt where you can invite your friends to play on. There is also the 2K Pro-Am mode which is similar to the Jordan Rec Center in the previous game, but not hidden behind the MyPark system. It also has a proper matchmaking system, which makes it much easier to get 10 people from around the world to get together to play a full 5-on-5 game. There is also Play Now Online which is basically a ranked online game mode where you can advance through different ""leagues"" which represent your skill level. Pretty similar to most other games' ranked matchmaking modes.MyCareer is in a weird place, where the game actually have already built a whole backstory for your created player. It has some weird quirks as I created a white player living in an African-American town, with African-American parents and an African-American twin sister. That takes the immersion out of the game mode a little. However, it is interesting in the way that you get to experience a custom curated story, unlike previous years where you're mostly just playing to increase your stats. You also now play through high school and college, which makes for an interesting experience, instead of just being thrown straight into the league.The presentation is also much improved. The menu interface is much slicker and more accessible than 2K15. The actual game also now has pre-show, halftime and post-game shows featuring Shaq, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith. The voice of the third commentator (replacing Steve Kerr) is awesome. There are also lots of player interviews which helps the atmosphere that you're watching a live TV broadcast. There are 50(!) in-game songs that make up the soundtrack which almost guarantees that you won't get tired of the playlist. Genres range from the standard rap/hip-hop to rock to pop and even some Spanish and one Korean song.And those are all great, but the best feature this game has is really how much better the actual basketball game is. Drives feel much smoother and traffic congestion within the paint is now no longer a problem if you run proper plays.  Defense is also much smoother and as a defender, I haven't found myself being left behind by the ball handler unless I make an actual mental error. The controls have changed, and there are now 3 pass buttons (seriously?), but the post trigger (LT) is a great idea and if you get used to the new controls, it actually feels more natural than the previous games. And of course, learn how to use the pro stick for best results.I'm sure if I play more hours of the game, I'll start to notice some annoying quirks. However, 5 hours and counting with the game and I can say that this is the most fun I have with a basketball video game. Even when you're losing, you're still having fun because the game doesn't feel like it's forcing invisible walls for you to get through.If you're interested in basketball, and you haven't played a basketball video game in a while, NBA 2K16 is the one to play.

It worked for 2 weeks, and was a great game. However an update caused the game to crash and be unplayable, and invisible players. The latest patch fixed the crash, but invisible players still there.

												Honestly, I don't understand why people are complaining about this game. This game is EXCELENT (apart from the Spike Lee Story mode smh). The gameplay is one of the best and I'm a 2k player since 2K10. It is balanced very well, I love it. The negative reviews probably come from the bad myCareer story, but once you get past that story, it becomes a normal MyCareer mode again. I really love the online modes (MyPark, ProAm, MyTeam, etc) so I had to buy this game, and I'm glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews on steam, because the game is excellent, it's running on 60+fps, having no problems. Maybe the bad reviews came after Update 1 and Update 2 (they fixed alot of bugs). If you love BASKETBALL and GAMING, 100% this game is for you. "

												Crap game to be honest. It seems like every year they are taking away features that are essential for this type of a game. Let's talk about MyCareer. Older NBA games such as NBA 2K13 had the interviews after each game. That was pretty fun and enjoyable, since the questions changed according to the way you played the game and the result of that game. Feature got cut. NBA 2K15 - interviews at halftime/after the game with the player - feature got cut. Talking to the GM about the team/playstyle of the team? Feature got cut. Almost nothing changes, exact same commentary lines every year, barely any new animations, ♥♥♥♥♥iest shooting release ever. If you couldn't be asked to read (which I know I wouldn't) - don't buy this game, an honest waste of money.			"

												This is hands down the best Sports game EVER created. Every game mode leaves you wanting to play more (offline). I personally enjoy more of the REAL life, simulation ball... and Pro-am fills that burning need for me on so many levels. The TWO things I don't like about this game.... The MC story is a joke and seriously racist... My other problem with this game is a HUGE problem... once again 2K has fully supported the console versions of this game, protecting their users from having to play with Modders or CE hacks... and again they fell short when it comes to the PC platform.. this SERIOUSLY ruins many aspects of online play. If it were NOT for the Hacks.. I would rate this game 10/10.. but do to the high numbers of CE users and 2K's blatant lack of  caring about it.. I am giving this game 5/10.			"

												Many of the same problems and bugs that were in 2k15 are in 2k16. If you're considering purchasing this game right now I'd recommend waiting until the 3rd or 4th patch comes out to resolve these issues that somehow keep coming up in every iteration of this game. Really trying to like this game, but it's very difficult with the bugs and some of the design decisions. Plus the storyline with myCareer and Spike Lee really came out of nowhere. I don't know anyone on the planet that was thinking, ""Hey I wish Spike Lee was involved in a basketball video game.""			"

												Well, after one day of playing the 2K16 I can say there aren't as many changes as I hoped. There is also a HUGE RACIST issue with MyCAREER mode. I play a 6'8"" WHITE dude, but still - his twin sibling is a black girl, which would be possible if their parents were an interracial couple, but they're both black too! If the issue was the opposite, you'd want to play a black kid and both parents and his twin sibling was black, there would be a HUGE scandal for days now. Don't know who to thank for, I think Spike Lee could say something about that - I remember him complaining that Clint Eastwood had failed to include a single African-American soldier in his films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, both about the 1945 battle for the Japanese island. Eastwood justified his choice of actors, saying that those black troops who did take part in the battle as part of a munitions company didn't raise the flag. So I suppose that Spike Lee defied reality and made white players to have a black background. It's just stupid and ignorant. There's only one world in his mind - New York City (Harlem especially) and only one race - BLACK. Keeping up with the story makes you facepalm twice an hour. Nevertheless, the game itself is almost pretty good, the tracklist choice is AWESOME. For now, I give it a strong 7/10. If you have NBA 2K15 you can easily stick with it. Still, if there will be NBA 2K17 next year, I certainly won't buy it before the official release and then some solid opinions form other sources.			"

												Let's set this straight, the gameplay itself is fun and well polished when it's working.  However the amount of bugs along with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MyCareer really forces me to not recommend this game.  The online works fine for the most part, no real connection issues, ProAm and all of those things are a nice addition.   I had a HUGE issue when I first started playing the game, I went into the graphic options and messed around.  I DISABLED V-sync and dynamic V-sync along with all of this, after applying the changes, the game froze and crashed.  So I then restarted the game and it began to run at 1FPS, luckily I remembered that 2k15 had a similar problem albiet less intense.  So I went into appdata/roaming and opened up the config file, only to see that the v-sync options were still enabled. I disabled those and launched the game again, now running at 200fps.List of bugs I've encountered:-FPS issue above-When subbing back in during MyCareer the player info pane never appears, forcing me to quit to the menu and reload-Player is litterally stuck in an animation when a pass or rebound is taken away at the wrong time.  You have to wait till the possesion is over-Some freethrows count for 2 points, then resulting in the team shooting to get the ball back.-The menu when you choose to either hang out/train or advance get's stuck on screen DURING the gameIf 2k patched out those problems the game wouldn't necessarily be better, just less annoying to play.  MyCareer is ♥♥♥♥, no real choices like they advertised, and you still have to pay for ♥♥♥♥ing accessories like socks with VC.  I only bought this game because it was on sale at GMG.  If it was full price, no way in hell would I have bought it.  There are just not enough changes to justify the full price for this game.			"

												The game mechanics are good, what kills the game to me are the hacked players online, the long grinding to unlock new attribute points (even if you zip through games and practices), and the fact that the promised VC for people who pre-purchased the game never were delivered.So if you stay away of myplayer and mypark game modes, you will probably enjoy the other features.Plus that Spike Lee joint was cheesy and a loss of time. I got really tired of being called ""Freq"" in the games and see that celebration ""vibrations"" after a play...I still play the game from time to time, but i would not recommend it.			"

												What even is this game... awful narrative, awkward writing, and impossible gameplay (for new players). There is quite literally no tutorials to help you learn the game or explain how the shooting system works and then it throws you into this plain awful career mode that makes absolutely no sense if you have a white character created as you have an entirely black family. No explanation of the controls whatsoever mixed with impossibly hard gameplay doesn't bode well.			"

												This game is trash but it's the only sports game on steam that isn't managing or cartoony. A summary of all gamemodes:MyCareer: Absolute rubbish until you finish Spike Lee sucking his own ♥♥♥♥. You don't get to make any choices for yourself even though the tag line is ""Be the story"". I don't know why anyone drafted me when I couldn't play well in college. I wanted to stay there. Nope.You lose points for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You lose points for leaving assignment when it might change playes on you out of nowhere. You get your shot blocked, lose points. Some guy dunks on your teammate? Lose points. The ONLY way to get better attributes is VC, which is easiest to get by PAYING.MyGM:Manager. Plenty of other games for this.MyLeague:See MyGM.MyTeam:P2W and unbalanced. Domination pits your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter pack players vs a max chemistry pro team. The Gauntlet puts you against any old chump playing the game (for instance, my first game was vs 2 amethysts). PROFESSIONALS miss casual layups and they even miss DUNKS!!!!!!!!!!MyPark:Cheaters and cheesers in every game.I still will play the game., but I'm not paying these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s a dime.			"

												From what I have seen this game simple is a worse version of NBA2k15. While there are actually quite a few possitive changes to the gameplay mechanics they are completely overshadowed by the the fact that this port is even more buggy and even less optimized than the previous iteration even though it is clearly made in the same engine. Just to top it off the Spike lee directed storyline is uninspired and frankly just lazy. I when you make a Myplayer of an ethnicity other than black or a mix of black you still have 2 black parents which would still be acceptable except for the fact that they were so short sighted as to give you a black twin sister which is 100% impossible. Considering that the Online play just god aweful on PC the only reason I bought the game personally was for the single player experience so in my opinion you should just save your money and buy 2k15 when is goes on sale if you really are craving a basketball game.

												The game is pretty chill; character customization is suprb! This is my first NBA 2k game so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I bought this game for like 6 bucks and decided I needed variety in my life. My career mode is very...odd. I feel like I have no free will in the game at all. I am fine with the family, and having a twin sister, because well I’m black. Spike Lee directs the story of a black kid coming up from the slums of the projects just trying to get into the NBA. While on your way to fame. The story mode only caters to one race. Spike Lee being who he is still created a very deep story for your character that will leave with ""Oh damn"" When everyone refers to you though they just call you 'Freq’. Secondly, the game feels more like a pay to win game. If you want to upgrade anything you have to put some real life cash into the game to get their online currency of VC. -Shooting at certain distance never guarantees you a shot for some reason even if it was TIMED PERFECTLY-Teammates will forget how to shot- The opposing team will become 3pt good out of no where.With all this in mind and the price they are trying to sell it for, I can't recommend the game.

												At it's current state, I don't recommend this game, not even if you get it from a gray key site. No, not becuase ""This game is racist because my family is always black and BLAH BLAH BLAH"" (those people need help if the really feel like that's racism). I don't recommend it because of what really matter: the gameplay.Now the game has made some improvements over last year, like some animations are better, it's not as easy to make shots as it was in the last game, slightly better player customization, the rival of MyCrew via the new ProAm mode (even if we can't play on our courts yet), MyCourt, some bugs/glitches fixed, etc. However there's a lot of new issues in the game, incuding some from the old game. For example, Demigods and hackers are back on MyPark. People have had 99 overalls since the day came out for people who preordered and managed to get things outside of their rank (skateboards, shirtless option, mascot gear, etc). Speaking of MyPark, the servers are very hit or miss. Either it runs smoothly or everyone lags the entire time and the game runs like a slideshow. Also there's an issue with the Got Next spots that sometimes happens that prevents anyone from getting on them. Also, that 1v1v1 mode they have in MyPark is kinda lame, but that's just me nitpicking.Moving onto MyCareer, it's also kind of a mess. The story is lame. I understand them wanting you to feel like a high school/college phenom, nad those games were fun, but once you get drafted is where I have issues with it. You're being being drafted amongst player that have ratings in the upper 70s (probably some in the lower 80s as well) but your overall is at a 55 to start, and yet the characters in the story talk about you potentially going lottery pick in the draft. The rookie season is only 8 games, which isn't that bad, except you basically get no VC at that point so you don't rank up that much going into your 2nd season. Also they advertised the new MyCareer story to make you think it's all about choices, but you really don't until you finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story. The only choice you get is the college you go to, and even then you only get about 10(?) choices for schools. Once your rookie season is over is when you actually get to make choices, which I enjoy. I like that you get to choose how you spend your off days, even though I wish you'd get more VC out of endorsements (since it doesn't seem like you make that much in games, regardless of how wellyou do).The biggest issue I have with the game, however, is the stability. Whenever I do MyCareer or Play Now games, my frames drop a lot, the game stutters, and the game crashes a lot. The game sometimes switches from full screen to windowed mode for no reason no matter what my settings are. All in all, I'd say just wait for a patch before you buy the game.			"

												I play the NBA 2k games every year because basketball is my favorite sport and NBA 2k is, unfortunately, the only halfway decent sim on the market.  The problem with this is that they have no pressure to get their ♥♥♥♥ together.I gave this game a positive review after playing maybe 10 hours because some basic issues with NBA 2k15 were fixed.  The movement feels more fluid than in that game.  NBA 2k15 is without a doubt the worst NBA 2k game ever made.  This is probably the 2nd worst game in the franchise though.  A new review is being written after playing many more hours.  I only play so many hours because I assume problems with the game are my own lack of skill for a bit, until you really get to notice specific problems.  I also just love basketball and keep getting fooled every year.  And it's such a shame because NBA 2k14 on next-gen console, not PC, had such great potential to be improved dramatically in the following years.  They removed all their progress for God knows what reason.The big draw is that Spike Lee did the MyCareer mode, and frankly it's by far the worst career mode in any sports game I've ever played, or any game with any mode even remotely comparable.  They put you in a Spike Lee film basically, except Spike Lee was obviously not allowed to make something like he'd actually put in a film (most of his films are R rated and this game is E rated, so you can imagine all the things he'd have to censor himself about).So they make your character's background be this incredibly stereotypical borderline offensive plotline, something which would be called racist if Spike didn't do it because it'd be called a parody of black life in New York.  You use 90s rap slang in a modern setting and have all kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t happen which doesn't actually move the plot of you being a basketball player forward.  I'm shocked Big Daddy Kane didn't have a writing credit.  You play like 8 games, 4 high school 4 college, to determine your draft slot.  Not a terrible idea by itself.  But they paint your character the whole time as being this godsend of a player.  Think of the way Lebron was anticipated as a kid out of high school.  Yet, if you spend no VC on your character before the draft, he comes in as a 55 overall.  This makes your player the worst in the league, literally.This is problematic for 2 major reasons: (other than the absurdity of being painted as Lebron and then coming in to be the worst in the league by far). 1) College and high school games are a complete waste of time.  Draft position couldn't matter less in any context, just your own role playing.  I normally care about draft position in these games, but they also usually care more about how I play during MyCareer in return.2) You cannot skip this for new players.After you're drafted, they only let you play 8 games of your first season.  It's abysmal.  Also, Spike's story actually has nothing to do with your real NBA career, i.e. the reason you're playing.  All it does is give you 2 hours of cutscenes interspersed between the pointless high school and college games.  There's hardly any actual story once you're a bonafide NBA player, which defeats the entire purpose of the mode.  The only thing you get are ""meetings"" with some select few famous players, and that's not actually anything more than clicking on menus and seeing some kind of a stat or VC boost at best.The MyGM mode is plagued with the practice time issue.  It becomes a nuissance immediately.  The mode itself is pretty easy, it's nowhere near as complex as something like Out of the Park Baseball is, obviously, but it's probably as bad as its ever been.  The trade logic, despite promises to the contrary, is equal to how bad it always is.  There's always so many dumb trades you can pull off.  It boggles my mind that the game allows such game breaking trades to be made.And the gameplay itself: again, the game feels better than it did last year, but not better than 2k14, and not better than almost any other year before that.  The shot meter is the one thing I like, and even that is bad half the time because you'll regularly miss perfectly aligned shot meter shots.  It defeats the purpose of the meter if you miss midrange jumpers with an 88 overall player on a perfectly in the green shot.The game feels like one of those old hockey tabletop games where all the players are stuck to the floor and you can only rotate them to shoot in a puck.  The players feel stuck to the floor.  They are moved against gravitational logic into positions to contest shots in ways which, after watching replays, make you want to tear your hair out.  The AI still cheeses with the shots it takes and makes.  The teammate AI in the MyCareer mode is, honestly, worse than it was even last year.  It makes it so that on high difficulty you can average over 40 a game and a triple double and still lose by 20.  How am I supposed to win when I get double'd, pass it out to open guys who can't hit shots that I'd make in real life?  2k NEEDS to get their act straight because the game suffers immensely.On PC the multiplayer modes have low populations.  The one mode which doesn't, where you take your MyCareer player to the park, has strange limitations.  If you don't choose to rep the park with the beach and the aquarium, you'll basically be left all by yourself in the ironworks park with no one to play with.  That mode has tons of hackers and cheaters in it, based on the complaints on the forums as well as what I've seen myself.  I haven't done much of that mode because the people who play that mode play almost exclusively that and you'll get killed repeatedly.  I'm really good at full team vs team basketball but the population is too low to rise in rank on that mode, all the people who play that regularly are already all at the top ranks.  You aren't allowed to play with higher ranked people for some reason in spite of population issues, it's a terrible design choice.And the VC gouging.  Everything costs more.  More money.  Pat Riley talked about the disease of more, where people wanted more playing time and more money for themselves to break up a potentially winning basketball team.  Who knew that you could also apply it to a video game franchise about basketball?  This game feels like the biggest cash grab yet, and that's saying a lot given the antics of last year's game.  They kept the terrible ♥♥♥♥ing system of upgrading stats in blocks, and now you have even stricter limits on your player's ability to rise in rank.  I'm stuck at 88 overall, I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do to be allowed to go higher in rank.And come on, 1000 VC for a ♥♥♥♥ing headband?  It's disgusting.  Absolutely disgusting.  I'm a fool for buying the game every year but I just love basketball so damn much.  If the Out of the Park guys made an NBA or even fictional basketball manager sim, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.  All the games that exist of that nature are awful, I've looked, so don't point me to that terrible basketball manager game that's on Steam.  And if those guys are reading this, you too should get your act together because there's money to be made and a complete void in this market.  If somebody came along and gave us a good basketball game, we'd all play it.P.S. It's a game where the players in real life actually are able to do better things than in this game.  It's a basketball game where you can't ever actually dunk on someone because of the flawed defense system.  There's still problems with height advantage in this game, a basic ♥♥♥♥ing concept in basketball.  This game is about a 55 overall, same as the rating they start your MyPlayer at.  But if they spend money, they can pay me and I'll upgrade their rating.  Or maybe just work on the gameplay this year?  And yes the 2kTV girl is hot but is 2kTV really a necessary feature?  It's just a waste of resources that should be going into the actual product.			"

												The ""story"" by Spike Lee is just stupid.- you create a caucasian player, but your family is african-american- your twin sister is african-american- your name is Frequency Vibrations............I did not get past my draft, because I couldn't even laugh at the story anymore.Everything in this game is very cinematic. You press something in the menu - whoosh whoosh baaam Steph Curry shooting for 3 points and then you can do something.There are so many cinematics in game that you cannot skip. Someone fouls, you have to watch the cheerleaders for 3 seconds. Someone gets fouled, something has to fly over your monitor before you can shoot. Oh, and then you get to 4th quarter.4th quarter in this game is absolute hell. Timeouts every 10 seconds, which means that you can't play for another 10 seconds, because the timeout animation can't be skipped. This happens maybe 3-4 times 4th quarter and some times before. And if you play a close game, then the players start fouling each other, which makes sense from a basketball point of view (probably), but I get pretty irritated when my players do something I did not tell them to do. Last 30 seconds of 4th quarter take about 2-3 minutes to play out and after 3 games it becomes a drag.If you want to play some basketball on PC, you have no other choice. And sometimes the games can feel pretty good, but everything in this game apart from the actual basketball is just dumb.			"

												If you want to play with friends, MyGm, MyCareer, there are no problems and you will have a ton of fun. Easy 10/10 Get it.When it comes to online, MyPark does seems like the only real playable mode. Rarely lags(on a lucky day at least), and good performance.But boiii... if you try to get on MyTeam, prepare to play on trasha** potatoe-lookina** servers. 1. The servers are SO trash, not even oscar the grouch would wanna live anywhere near them. You will lead by 5/10/15 or even 20 points, the connection to the fu**in' 2K servers will die, and you'll get an L  because the other guy is playing on some kinda rain forest bamboo-broadband type connection. And guess what? Exactly, he'll get the W.2. No voice-chat. Basically 2K not giving a **** about the PC-Community.3. The online 3-point cheese. Your opponent will -> hand the ball to his point guard -> call for a screen -> drive to the basket -> the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI-Defense will switch from peremiter-defense to the dude driving to the basket, even though you're chasing down and there is no need to, since there is still a defender in the paint -> he'll pass to the now open peremiter-shooter -> threes on threes on threes. You can excessively call 3-2, 2-3, Man-to-man etc., the AI wont care. It'll leave it's assignment whatever you do.Conclusion : This game is easily the best sports game if you have friends to come over to play local 1v1/2v2/... , MyCareer, MyLeague or MyGM. Solo : Recomendation.When it comes to online multiplayer on PC, think of DeAndre Jordan slam dunking the 2K servers into the trash can like he did on Brandon Knight.Edit: Was leading a game by 3 points today, disconnected, got handed a 0-0 L        Was leading a game by 2 points just now, disconnected and, take a guess, got handed     another 0-0 L. Both in the first damn half.2nd Edit: I live in Germany and got100Mbit/s, so don't even think of telling my that I'M the one with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet.			"

Summary/Overview NBA 2k16 is the most recent in cutting edge technology acclaimed for a decade now by fans, critics, game reviewers and writers as the premier and ultimate experience for a pure basketball simulation that remains bar none to its other former competitor, NBA Live made by Electronic Arts. Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics & mechanics) Features  Game Modes    There are so many game modes that for the sake of the review length limit I am allowed to produce on Steam, I can't go in-to-depth on all of them. Thus, I will discuss the game modes I have taken time out to play. Those are Play now, my Career & My GM.    The play now game mode is what all of us 2k sports consumers have grown to love over time for those of us that have played 2K basketball before. However, for those of you that have never played a 2KXX game in your life, it is synonymous with quick game where it gives you the option to play in the NBA today matchups which update every single time the NBA season as a whole progresses and then the most common game mode being where you choose a team and then choose who your opponent's team will be if you are playing against the computer.  Presentation in Play Now    The presentation has improved over outdated NBA 2k games such as NBA 2k12 and even now NBA 2k14. It is much more realistic showing pre-game rituals, pre-game warm-ups, half-time shows, a message time to time from a player with their thoughts on things when they are interviewed and finally a post-game analysis with ShaQ, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson. The reflections upon the light reflected off of the court is accurate to a tee representing the hardwood floors in an exact 1:1 replica portion of the real thing in the NBA. My favorite part overall of this is when the public announcers announce all the famous cliché sayings all of us have grown to love over time. These include sayings such as, "" Rockets ball"", ""Detroit Basketball! "" and so much more.    Growing up in Houston, Texas half of my life at my current age of twenty-three, my Dad would win off of the radio many NBA tickets in the various states we have lived being Houston, Texas; Oregon and even Mississippi to see the Memphis Grizzles. I used to appreciate the announcers the most because of their personality and charisma. I still to this day while playing 2k sports national basketball association games, absolutely love teams that have a good announcer with a great personality, the way that they are able to craft the names is what still brings me in. My favorite teams currently based on their announcers alone in the way they say player's names in order are: Detroit Pistons, Denver Nuggets, Cleveland Cavs, Houston Rockets and the Miami Heat.    Now I will get into my primary disappointment within NBA 2k16. They took out some of the signature animations they had put in NBA 2k14 and other ones near that year such as when LeBron James goes over to the mat near the sideline to wipe off his feet while rubbing lotion together as it disperses in the air during his famous pre-game clap. I miss this so much. Another example are some key points dealing with Kobe Bryant. Some of his same signature behaviors we have come to know and love have now been eradicated, null, non-existent. For example, if you want it to be accurate in a 1:1 ratio, Rasheed Wallace, yes I know he is retired now but we will just use him right now to illustrate this example along with Metta World Peace (Formerly Ron Artest). Rasheed is known as a class clown that picks on teammates and is very displeased when the referees call something that goes against his favor.      He should be seen in-game with behaviors that promote foolery and arrogance. Ron Artest on the other hand, now still currently active in the 2K series and known as Metta World Peace now should have his signature move of patting his teammates on the butt, because he always does that often and it is unique to his personality and character upon the court.    Through this review, I have only had the opportunity to thoroughly try out two different teams in quick match, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Houston Rockets.  1. The Milwaukee Bucks    The Bucks play just like they do in the actual national basketball association. Each team is designed in a 1:1 ratio to play based on whether they are a team that shoots the lights out normally from mid and three-point range (e.g., Warriors, Cavs, Heat, Spurs & Thunder). Other teams that are excellent defensively but slower down the court offensively (e.g., Celtics, Bulls, Pacers, Hawks & Grizzlies). The bucks are a primary offensive team, they push the ball up the court fast, usually nail buckets from mid-range and even three-point range pretty easily and always get toward the free-throw-line. 2. The Houston Rockets    The Houston Rockets are one of the safest teams to use all around in NBA 2k16 and beyond and here is why. Since the Rockets have acquired Jason Terry, James Harden and Dwight Howard, they are a good threat, and force the defender to know the mechanics it operates under.  I have been playing the Houston Rockets so long in NBA Live and NBA 2k, that I now fully recognize how the whole team's chemistry works despite what players they have. They share the ball like the Spurs do, dominate you in the paint, work it out to mid-range and push the tempo at a steady pace to get up in your face and make you question the team's interior, exterior motives. I won't lie, I do miss not having Kevin Martin, but, instead, now there is James Harden on the Rockets which perfectly takes his place and he is much healthier.My Career Mode    My career mode is a brand new edition this year by the direction of Spike Lee in order to include a storyline for the first time in a simulated basketball game. Highlights: Production quality matches Grand Theft Auto V voice overs, graphics and emotion. You play in the life of a guy named Freq surrounded by his twin sister, Cee-Cee and his best friend, Vic (Short for Victor). Freq is a straight A student out of high school distinguished by honors and is from Harlem so him and his friends use urban slang in their dialect. GM Mode    It is best defined as a mode in which you become the general manger of any team you want while controlling finances, assets, accounting, projections, recruiting new free agents, players on your team and signing them to contracts. You work for the owner of your team and are not allowed to disappoint, you have to learn responsibility, resource; time-management and humility in order to survive the simulated life of what real-life general managers in sports face up against daily, weekly and monthly.Pros & ConsPros•Excellent atmosphere, production quality, storyline, new features, new game modes, presentation and graphics•Fun, easily enjoyable and endlessly replayable•It can replace the NBA for those that don't keep up with the games on television any•Accuracy in character models, the 2015 NBA draft selections, team dynamics, player tendencies, behaviors and reactions•The best 2k game since NBA 2k7 and NBA 2k12Cons•Online matches crash often on the PC, so be wary of that•Laggy online connection when playing online with others normally•Some player's signature behaviors through non-verbal cues have been taken out but have been replaced and made betterOverall- 10

												The game that I played in February 2016 seemed free of the bugs that a lot of people have mentioned and ran very well on a GTX 980. I thought it was a great basketball sim with amazing graphics, so much stuff packed into it, would take ages to exhaust all it has to offer.			"

												Good Game, but the bugs and crashes are terrible. I have a good computer that exceeds the recommended requirements. However the game is full of crashes, you will crash in mid game. Often times the game will start then crash right away over and over. My Player Mode is terrible in 2k16, Spike Lee ruined it. He needs to understand that not everyone that loves basketball is from Harlem with black twin sister. It makes no sense for my character to be any other race than black, if my twin sister is a black girl. It is not MY PLAYER, its Spike Lee's Player. Can't even choose my own name, I have to be called Freq (Freak) all the time. Character customization is terrible.			"

												Recently the game started crashing after every other MyCareer match, At the end of the game it just crashes to the desktop and none of the progress gets saved. When you load it back up you have to play the game all over again and it makes progression impossible. Also MyCareer was just plain bad this year. You have no control over your Rookie season. They let you play 8 games and the rest are simulated so you can't even be rookie of the year. I know this review is a bit late but even if this game is on sale it's not worth purchasing at this point because the crashing issue makes it pretty much unplayable.			"

												I've always been a fan of 2k. It's my third year buying the game, but this time they got it all wrong.The game is full of bugs: naked people, invisible players, comentators stops speaking for no reason, game crashes for no reason, nobody is playing online, a lot of cheaters and lack of support from 2k that didn't solve any of the issues yet (it's been more than a week). By far the best engine of the history of the franchise, but by far the worst game of them, it's almost unplayable at this point. Don't waste your money on it like I did.			"

												It's not that NBA2K16 is a bad game, it's just not a really good game. And when they're charging AAA prices for it, I can't really recommend it. The pros:- Interesting and plenty of online and offline game modes- Good graphics (if you can run it)- It's better than NBA Live and one of the only sports games left still available on PCCons:- Clunky controls and animations. Even in offline mode the controls are clunky and feel unpolished. Animations finish slowly even in high energy situations like when youre on a fast break or when youre stuck in the paint trying to pass the ball. I constantly deal with things like my player receiving a wide open pass on a fast break, but he takes the pass with no urgency so by the time the catch animatino is over and my jump shot animation begins, I'm covered. There are many many more examples of clunky controls and animations getting in the way. I could go on for paragraphs. Very frustrating.- Mostly luck based. Want to do anything besides post up cheese? I hope youre feeling lucky. Drive the basket? Maybe you'll do an awesome move, freeze your defender and score, maybe you'll get blocked. Jump shots are by far the worst. You can never tell when they are going to drop. Wide open, fully contested. There seems to be little rhyme or reason to them. I understand real life basketball can often be like this as well, but trust me.... in this game it's very difficult to develop a strategy besides get a guy open and pray. Or just cheese up the post.- Lag. The online lag is often unbearable. Sometimes it's good, most of the time it's not. They rely on p2p connections which can be confusing to some players causing lag for everyone in the match.- Buggy. Never remembers account info. This game tells me every other day that my account is expired and I have to re-enter all the information. I get my account back, but it's a process. I have tried everything on the support page to solve this. It also happens in the mobile companion app.- Buggy. I literally have to change my controller setup every game. The pro stick by default is used for dribbling and shooting so I turn it to dribble only plus absolute. Every. Game. Every game after I hit it and notice it's reverted back resulting in breaking up my play.- Buggy. Every single day when I play guantlet, the first match I can't move. Like my character literally can't move. I have to alt+tab, kill process, try again and it's fixed. This means every day I have to start my online play with a loss.- Buggy. Many random and lazy bugs. Like your character not putting his arms on the table in interviews.. they sort of oddly float. I have no idea how that passed QA. Your arms or jaw will just random shake when on the bench. And many more things like this.- Spike Lee. I won't even elaborate on this as it's been done to death. Just google ""LIVIN' DA DREAM"" and you'll know what I want to say since nobody has anything good to say about it.I could easily go on with the cons. Yes, all games have bugs and minor problems, but in NBA2k16 they seem to stack up. They stack up and weigh against very few good things about the game. Considering this is your only option to play Basketball on PC, I guess I could recommend it based on that. If you could live with or whithout a basketball game though, then I would recommend you save your money.			"

												2K Games’ NBA series has proven to be the basketball game of choice over the last few years, much more popular than EA’s Live brand. One of the main reasons behind this is the constant drive to evolve and provide memorable experiences. Some have entries have been excellent, like the previous NBA 2K15, while others, such as 2K14 left a bit of bad taste behind due to various constraints.NBA 2K16 isn’t the biggest departure from 2K15, but there is one major difference and that is the change to the MyCareer mode. Film director Spike Lee has brought his experience to the mode and added a story that has a big impact on the rookie season of the MyCareer mode. In this mode you control a person called Frequency Vibrations, or Freq for short – that isn’t his real name, which is left to you as you create the player. If you have saved data from 2K15 then you can import the player from that game, though only his appearance will transfer over and not attributes.The Spike Lee directed portion of MyCareer is called Livin’ Da Dream, and sees you go from high school, to college and then the NBA. It is a different approach to what we saw previously, as you shape Freq’s choices, such as the university he goes too, so that I ended up at the University Of Kansas. The acting is well done by all that were involved, and seeing your player’s history unfold in such a fashion is an interesting idea.However for Livin’ Da Dream to work, a major component of MyCareer has been cut down, and that is the rookie season in the NBA. It is still there, but it’s been reduced from a full 82 game season to just eight games from different points of the season, with a couple more at the end if your team reaches the play-offs. I honestly don’t know why 2K chose to cut such a major piece of the game, especially since the story doesn’t make up for the reduction.The rookie season has traditionally been where a lot of player growth and development is done. Each match can see you improve as you acquire more points to increase attributes with, and if you’re good enough, you can even compete for Rookie of the Season. At least, you could. Here there is no chance to try for that accolade, and the fewer games mean that in the second season of MyCareer your Freq is much lower rated than others players at the same point in their careers within the game.There have been other additions to MyCareer which do add to the experience of being a pro basketball player. Your agent helps you get endorsements and you can also hang out with players from around the league. These options are available on your off days, so you can get some points shooting a promo or potentially do some networking should you decide to spend the day with others. You can also choose to train on your off day and try to improve skills from there. However, these options are only available from the second season onwards, due to the Livin’ Da Dream being the most important aspect of your rookie season.As before, the best mode for play with an entire team would be MyGM, in which you control everything from team roster, the way the budget can be allocated, and the action on the court. Each team’s owner will have different goals for you to achieve with the squad, be it making the play-offs or winning the championship. You’ll field press conferences too with the answers given affecting how the team see you, and how the media views you.NBA 2K16 does play well, with team movement seeming to be more fluid, and the way the ball is passed about a lot more. The AI is challenging but not to the point where it is frustrating, with each team having their advantages and disadvantages. Neither opposition AI nor team AI is infallible and occasionally mistakes will be made, like a pass being thrown too early or the ball being stolen leading to a turnover.Team mates will usually run into the correct lanes so you have an easier time of passing around, or defending when needs be. Fouling also seems to be less of an issue than previous games too, allowing for the matches to move forward with fewer interruptions, and you can choose to call a time-out and manually sort out substitutions, or allow the game to do it automatically for you.On the multiplayer side of things you can play locally and online competitively. MyPark allows for you to team with other individuals to play matches against others, while MyTeam is the mode where you can collect players through opening card packs or obtain them through picks after winning certain games. The goal is to create a highly rated team as well as collect every card possible, which will take quite some time, since there are over 2400 of them. Online leagues are back too so if you have a group of friends to play NBA 2K16 with it is definitely worth setting up.NBA 2K16 isn’t a huge jump over NBA 2K15 in the graphics department, but it remains an incredible looking game. The commentary also continues to be the best of any sports game so far, and with the addition of the pre and post game shows to MyCareer, you get much more analysis of players and teams through the game.

												I'm a huge Fan of the NBA 2K title's, but this year - i don't recommend it!YES - NBA 2k16 is still the best Sport Simulation out there imo! YES - it provides fun for 1000 Hours!But why I shouldn't buy it? Simple reason:First of all, Spike f*ing Lee? Yeah, you guessed it. This year MyCareer is a total disaster. I hate every second of this ""Story"" ( yeah its actually a Script Story ). For me MyCarrer starts after the Rookie Year. And then? Its ok I would say. Nothing special after the Rookie Year.Other negative Points:- A.I. is a joke this year. Every Difficulty under HoF is too simple to beat and HoF itself is just cheating around ( hitting every contested 3 Pointer in Clutch situation f.e. )- Perfect release can miss- No free agency after Seasons ( MyCareer )- Spike Lee Story- 2k Servers are still pretty pretty bad- Connection Timeouts in Multiplayer- On release so many Cheater ( i think there are still in the game )- Framedrops ( not PC optimized )- NBA doesnt keep my Settings- Spike Lee Story- Still VC SystemAND NOW ladys and gentlemen, my favorite Point:2k doesn't save your progress on there Server! What does this mean? F.e you spend 100+ hours on one player and maybe some Money too.If your File got corrupted or ( in my case ) you reinstall NBA (without Cloud activated), your progress and spent VC are lost. You have no Chance to get anything back. And thats ridiculous! I tried to contact the support and they are just said ""you accept our EULA and we can't give VC back""What a great way to steal your Money!GreetzFetzL			"

												For as amazing as the console version of 2K16, the PC version is still a VERY buggy affair. From issues with frame stuttering, input lag, audio drop-outs and online connectivity to the absolute lack of real help by the 2K Support crew, as much as I want to love and play this game, I can't help but tell people to steer clear of it.

												The game has it's flaws. The graphics are gorgeous. But the gameplay has become intolerable. You spend most of the time trying to get the player to move where you want them to move. I don't know what it is, but when a path is open and you push that direction, there is no reason for that player not to move there (no matter how bad their stats are) So instead you will continuously press harder in that direction (don't do this, eventually your controller will break).My biggest gripe is the ""My Career"" mode. It's not moving in the right direction drama-wise. Before I bought the game, I read all of the criticisms regarding the Spike Lee story and didn't think it could be that bad. It was BAD. It was basically a bunch of LONG cutscenes that are incredibly boring, there is nothing interesting about the story. I remember Spike Lee movies having a little oomph to them but this story was vanilla and played out like a Tyler Perry story. Painful. Besides that, it is the same ol' become a NBA player and get mandatory endorsements (I would rather endorse a cheap shoes like Starburys) and become a corporate shill, just how the NBA is supposed to be.  But those things aren't the worst part about My Player, it is the slow pace that you get VC. They intentionally gimped the amount you get to entice you to buy some online. Like a free-to-play game.  And you almost have to buy it because your player starts off awful stat-wise. My character was a  pg whose stats are so bad it is painfully obvious that they don't belong in the NBA let alone have teams competing for their services. No rookie of the year possibilities (I'm not even sure if it's possible)When your stats are bad, your passes go to the defenders. While playing defense your character automatically RUNS AWAY from offensive players. Opposing defenders don't allow you to effing MOVE and when you try to move (spamming turbo)... turnover. (same crap as the other version) so nothing different there.  Boring post game press conferences supplant the obnoxious cut scenes in season 2, it's just not worth it (in MY Career at least)  Fun!I am a huge NBA fan, and would like to play a basketball RPG for once that I could relate to, but year after year, the same basic premise and actor. The direction they take My Career is so far removed from who I am IRL, I lose immersion. Instead of changing the formula up, they double down on the formula. Who asked for this? So, be warned. Then again, this is just my opinion.			"

												Okay, I feel obligated to actually post a review from the standpoint of someone who actually enjoys the game. There are many positives to the game if you play it with the correct mindset. However, with that being said, there are a few issues that are rather annoying when they pop up.MyCareer- Spike Lee screwed up the mode quite a bit, but once you get past the storyline, it is better than ever. BUT the storyline, is absolutely hilarious due to the fact that I am a white Point Guard who acts not like the average black man, but the average ghetto, uneducated thug. Good for a laugh for sure but definitely a bit unrealistic, considering that you have a black twin sister. It is just a story mode until the end of your rookie season, and then the choice is all yours as to how you do things. MyTeam- Great gamemode if you put enough time into it. Any game you play will have one or two players who bought their way to skill. There will always be that one guy who just dumped a bunch of money in the game and therefore is automatically at an advantage. The other big problem with player vs player is the fact that there are many ways for you, not neccesarily to have an advantage, but play in a not so polite manner. Spamming three pointers is very easy especially in modes like gauntlet so beware because most people do it. The same goes with Zig-Zagging and other tactics that lead me to question the amount of fun that they might be having. Also the computer is infuriating at every turn. The game is designed to make it challenging, so you will end up missing wide open three pointers and dunks but the computer, somehow dunks on everyone and shoots threes fading over centers. Sucks, but deal with it because there is nothing that you can do to combat it. No matter how good of ball handles your player has, you are prone to suddenly dropping the ball at random points. Game Quality- So despite the problems I just mentioned, the game itself isn't that bad. If you have an older computer or a lower quality computer, than you may have to lower the game settings in the menu. Does it suck, yes, but you get used to it. Most of the people who have lag and framerate issues are trying to run the game on max settings on a computer that has the gaming ability and power of a microwave. Don't blame the game for your bad computer. Overview- Worth the buy for sure, but like every game has its issues. You will enjoy the game if you have regular expectations. I love the game and we need more people on the online servers so the game is worth the money.			"

												Got this game as a part of the 2K Humble bundle. Installed it with a bunch of the other games and started the career mode which was fun. Stopped playing for a couple days while I tried some of the other titles. In the meantime Windows 10 updates to the newest version. Come back, unable to play the game. Do research, find out it's due to the Windows update. I'm like, ok, I'll wait for the devs to get a patch out. I'm still waiting like 2 weeks later... Right now the game is an unplayable brick on my hard drive. I do not recommend this game to anyone who actually enjoys playing the games they purchased. I do recommend it if you simply collect games and never intend to play them. It fits nicely into the N catagory on your alphabetical list.			"

												NBA2K16, the game and series as well, truely expresses my love for the game of basketball.  Basketball is actually my one true passion in real life, aside from playing video games.For me, it is an escape and it is unlike any other sports video game.  Like, if I could I'll play this game for 24 hours in each day, I would but I shouldn't coz that would be insane. My very first ever basketball video game was Double Dribble on console and NBA Live 97 for PC.  From then on, I've gotten a hold of every NBA Live basketball game on PC up to 2008.  NBA 2k9 by 2K Sports was my first game fom the company and it change everything for me BIG TIME.  Compared to EA Sports' NBA Live, 2K Sports' version of the game is the best bar none.   No. No, I don't want to hear your NBA Live argument. It's the best basketball video game and that is it for me. 2K Sports' version got it right for me in every single way.  The speed, fluidity of movement, the level of player detail, the shoes and accessories, etc. This video game is almost the same as real life basketball...not really LOL.My only rant about the game is when you play MyPark.  I am pretty much an average player but most players there should learn how to play like a team and learn how pass the ball specially to the open guy.  ""Hey!!! Look I'm open, are you blind, WTH?""  Moreover, most if not all should definitely learn how to play defense.  More often than not, your teamates only knows one (1) play, and that is, pass it to him  and get out of his freakin' way, again WTF.  Sadly, that is not how to play the game.  But seriously, NBA2K16 for me has become a channel for letting go of my life, my thoughts, my worries and my burdens.  I cannot complete my day without playing this game.  In real life, I cannot go more than a week without feeling the touch of a basketball.  For pure hoop fans, I recommend this game.NOTE: I play basketball on a keyboard and if you ever been beaten by yours truely, just keep that in mind - again by a keyboard player.  Peace out.			"

												I love the 2k series and this one was the buggiest they have ever released for the PC. In one case, I had to play the same game/opponent 3 times before the game finally let me finish it without crashing. Every game, the announcers will stutter and fail. Every game.Otherwise, this is the best in the series in terms of control, playcalling and over all feel. Unless they fix the crash bugs, I do not recommend this one. The frustration is just too much.			"

												Disclaimer: I almost exclusively play MyCareer and MyPark so that's what my review is about. After finishing incredibly boring and distasteful first season (Spike Lee shenanigans), it turns into a pretty good game. Rebounding is seriously improved over the past few editions, and park is better balanced (still not perfect, of course, but at least it's not full of 7'3 people). Stat caps are serious business this time around, and they really help that balance. However, it does mean that you hit the wall pretty early in terms of progression and then it gets really slow afterwards. Graphics are really nice and the game works fine for me in 4k on a single 980ti (60 FPS, no hiccups). Bit of a downside is that MyCareer still doesn't offer proper challenge and balance at higher difficulties. For example on Superstar, my team will simply lose more games than on All-Star, but I am still able to average around triple double (31-11-9) on my All-Around SF in 2nd season. Seems that increasing the difficulty just makes your team miss more, and other team hit absurd shots. But then again, this is really no different than before.			"

												Well best basketball simulator if you play offline. Well AI sometimes still do stupid things.Worst arcade basketball game if you play online.Just pick Cavaliers and choke those threes whole game, and at the end of the game you get your win.No skill needed, sometimes it looks like this game based on scenarios. Tie game? Last seconds? There is big chance that someone get clutch points to win a game. Or if you alone at the three point line you have big chance to splash that three. Specialy if you playing online. If game start to get laggy you can't defense seems like other players just  freeze watch and how opponent go straight line to youre basket. "

												For the ones that are really in love with the game of basketball and like to spend some good time playing offline, this is the go to game. If you are planning to go online, i warn it you in that in any Nba 2k game will not be a good exprienced, the servers are laggy and despite that there's a huge number of cheaters around MyPark and AM's.In terms of gameplay speaking, this is not the best NBA 2k in that aspect the offense seems kinda slugish and you will feel, especially offline, a huge struggle to go past defenders without having that Ankle-Breaker badge, there's some problems around defense as well, but with some time playing you will get the touch of it and it's pretty functional when you get the point. Be sure you set your controllers configuration for Absolute this will change the feel for the game, becoming more fluid and less frustating than camera relative.During my time playing the game i do not experienced any crash issues or controller bugs during the time i bought a new pc.

												I've been a player of NBA 2K since 2K10, I really like the way it improves every year, graphics, controls, realism gets better. They removed setting up your own bench, quick, defense etc lineups, so subing in people is a little time consuming, no vocal controls. Other than that I really love the way this one turned out, I'm not really a MyPlayer person, but it's pretty fun.I fully recommend this game for any type of basketball nut or casual player.

												Extremely too difficult.I understand you want a realistic basketball sim, but this is ridiculous. I have the difficulty set to pro and I have yet to win a game in MyGM. The AI makes all of their wide open shots, while even if your player is wide open and you hit the shot timer as close as you can, you will still miss. Even if you manage to build a small lead, the AI immediately becomes unstoppable for a few possessions just to even everything out. Making adjustments makes absolutely no difference. The passing controls are garbage, if you are running a play and you try to pass it to the open player it almost never goes to the right player.I want a realistic basketball game, but I don't want to have to watch youtube tutorials for two weeks before I'm even able to become decent at it.

												This is an amazing game, if you can deal with the issues that sets this game a step back. First of all, gameplay is great. Most of  the player movement is realistic but there are few animations that are apsurd and some exploits that some users take advantage of, and of course cheaters. MyCareer was interesting when played for the 1st time but it is very repetitive and boring at times. Pro Am is fantastic, in somewhat ways. The worst part of it is that if you want to play Pro Am solo is very difficult to find players, especially during day because it has really terrible matchmaking. This is the worst part of the whole NBA and is needed to be addressed in future releases. Making something like general chat in each game mode is the key to improving the gameplay for players.All of the above said is really a small part of this game and is ignorable because this game has so many great features which you will enjoy like never before, and I am saying this after playing since NBA 2k9.

												This is literally the worst game. 2k went way overboard with the computer defense. They also made the computer godly at every aspect of the game. Even scuba make every shot they take. If you try to cross up the computer you will be unsuccessful and the ball will be stolen by a big man, which leads to an easy fast break every time.

Not totally optimized for competitive online games on PC._______________Steam Optimization as of 18/09/2016[tested with Win 10 Pro - 64 bit - Version 1607- OS Build 14393.187, MoBo MSI Z170A Gaming Pro - FW Build 1.B0, Intel i7 6700k, Gigabyte GeForce GTX 970 Xtreme Gaming Edition - Driver Version 372.70, Kingston Hyper X 8x2 GB 2666 MHz, game and steam client installed on Western Digital Blue 3TB model WD30EZRZ-00Z5HB0]As usual when talking about NBA 2K games, the title faced technical issues throughout the year. Some issues were promptly repaired, others required a longer period to be fixed (remarkable was an online-breaking bug following the Windows 10 anniversary update which impeded almost all the players to connect to the servers for more than one week) while others were never totally resolved (such as the above mentioned online cheaters issue). All in all a well optimized and supported game which, however, didn't really favor the players who wanted to participate in competitive gaming.			"

												I'm just gonna get to the point here since this is my first time on writing a review for any kind of game, so I'm gonna keep it short. Lag, Random Crashes, and disconnections in MyPark are just a FEW of NBA 2K16's glaring flaws. You would think that after all the money 2K makes from their microtransactions, that they would atleast fixed most of the mistakes in their previous games. But Noooo, they decide that it's a waste of time and resources to fix problems on a single game in an annual released series. I swear, 2K is becoming EA in some ways. But 2K maybe worse, mainly because of the fact that unlike EA, 2K doesn't bother fixing any big glitches/bugs. They are only in it for the money. Whoever reads this, please save your money on games that are worth your hard earned money. If we all stop supporting 2K, or any developers who don't care about their fanbase, we can make them change their money grabbing ways.			"

As a gamer myself, I know this experience can be extremely annoying and discouraging. We appreciate customers like you who have the best interest of a fair game in mind. However, here at 2K technical support, we do not have the necessary administrative tools to ban players. But not all are bad news, the developers are aware of unfair player’s and they have procedures to ban those who cheat.You can report unfair players to Steam through their support page. Naturally, if, at any moment, you would like to report someone who's not playing fair, you can always come to us.I hope this clarifies your question, but should you have any other doubts or concerns, let us know and I’ll be happy to assist you.Good luck on the courts!Kind regards,Flora R.2K SupportTo sum things up, if you wanna play with cheaters and have 2k do nothing about it then buy this game, Cheers.

												If 2K fixes the bugs, I'll make this review positive. Maybe..  ""Contains spoilers""MyCareerFirst of all, lets talk about Spike Lee's ""Livin da dream"" story to MyCareer. The story is stereo typical on the highest level possible. I made a  white player, but my whole family is black. Slang words in every sentece is frustrating to hear and watch(subtitles). Conversations are so unreal, stupid and too long.. And you cant even choose your own nickname. So prepare to be called one thing and only ONE THING. The story starts in High School which is pretty cool. 2K tries to add an nice atmosphere, and it's actually decent. After the High School games which are apoximately 4 games(2min quarters), you are getting offers from several Colleges around the country. Then you choose the college you want to attend to and 8 college games later, you are littereally in the NBA. I dont know why 2K want you to rush through theese stages. They should allow you to choose between how many games you want to play, aswell as how many minutes the quarter should last. Because in the end, it doesn't feel real at all. After you get drafted to the NBA, your first season will likewise only be 8 games and then you become a free agent. Luckily after you have chosen your new team, during free agency the main story ends and you can move on with the game and your career. Your second season in MyCareer is where it all falls back into place. It feels like home again and I was actually starting to enjoy the game because I could play throughout a whole season, making endorsements, connections and so on for my player. Pro-Am New to this year's 2K is Pro-Am. I have been looking forward to it, and it was one of the first things I tried out when i started up the game. This game mode is better than ""MyPark"", and especially if you have a couple of friends to play with. It's a 5v5 game, where you control your MyPlayer amongside others, either you team up or you simply just join and wait for 9 others. This game mode has a unique feature, where you can build your own team from the buttom and have friends to join in and play for it. You are able to design and UPLOAD!! your own logo, shirt, arenas and even the scorer's table advertisements! I have already made my hometown's team ""Aalborg Vikings"", designed their jerseys so they look 100% as they do in real life. Costomized their homecourt aswell, and added real advertisements. Let me just say, that I cant wait for my friends to join in!			"

												2k just doesn't care about the PC community and well, I can't blame them in the sense that it's not as big on consoles but it doesn't make me want to purchase the game next year. Optimization seems to be good now. Game keeps crashing. I love 2k I've been playing it as far as I can remember but it's sad to see them not giving a F. But let's focus on microtransactions shall we ? Pay $20 to have your played maxed out why not ? The mycareer just seems like a big joke. What were they thinking hiring a racist prick like Spike Lee ? Cmon now. After the latest patch they fixed the PNR cheese but now you can barely make one. I don't do them often at all but when I do, they never work. I'll keep playing this game and you will see my hours increasing because I love basketball and because EA is just a joke (not sure why they keep releasing games) but it would be a lie if I told you that I would recommend this game.

												The game is great, when it works, but constant issues make the game unplayable for extended periods of time, whether it's having  the commentators going silent almost every game, or objects like the crowd, players or the bloody court disappearing altogether, CTDs while loading on the loading screen.  And those are only the minor things.There's also issues with the servers, ""bugfix"" updates that seemingly fix nothing but your ability to successfully launch the game - i.e. CTDs about 2 seconds after the game is launched.To be fair, 2K sports games on pc have always been really buggy in many ways, but this year the variety and consistency of the bugs are pretty damn egregious.  This is the first year that I have actually been frustrated by NBA2K.I would advise caution when purchasing this game if you are anything close to an impatient person, because this game can and at times WILL test your resolve.  I per-ordered the game and I am really disappointed in myself for not waiting for a sale.However, all that being said...When it works, the game is great.			"

												This game crashes and bugs out more than any game I've ever seen. I play a lot of MyTeam. Every game is a minimum of 25 minutes. I constantly get arbitration failed to load, or the game just crashes. Then I have to give up the win, the MT, and the 25 minutes i wasted. It's funny how their games are like this every single year. Do not buy this game unless you like wasting your time.			"

Most of all, where on earth is our pre-order bonus. 2K go kill yourselve. Your game is a disappointment. Instead of wasting $79 on this game; go buy youtselve a csgo skin!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												This is a tough review to write because there are some things that are really great about this game and others that are really bad.  First of all, if you don't have a new nvidia card then dont even bother because it is not optimised for anything else.  I have a gtx 970 so i can play it pretty much maxed though.  I am going to talk about the my career mode mainly since thats all I have really played and it is pretty much what I buy 2k for.  The problem with this game is the story kind of ruins it.  Your family is black even if you make a white character and the story is really cheese and you don't actually get any choice in any big decisions for your character.  The cut scenes are 20 min long even though they could be summed up in a 1 min scene.  The story definitely affects your character too much.  You don't get to decide what type  of person you want your player to be- spike lee decides that for you.  He also decides that you will leave college after your first year even though they make such a big deal over what a huge decision it is.  One of the biggest issues is that you dont get to play your rookie year.  You only play 8 games and you have no chance to make the playoffs.  Also, your ratings in this game start out at the lowest ever.  only about a 50 overall.  And best of all, you make no vc at all for the high school or college games.  And since you only play 8 games in your first season, you pretty much go into your second season with that same rating.  I think that this is just greed on 2k's part trying to get you to buy vc because if you didnt preorder the game for the extra 10k vc and you are just playing from the starting rating it is really brutal to try and progresss.  It is basically like taking a middle school kid and throwing him in to play with professionals.  It is really annoying to see this happen in a game that I paid 60 bucks for.  And, after all this hype over the story, it ends after the first season.  The story really ♥♥♥♥ed up this game and I really think 2k should just give you an option to skip it entirely and just play your first season as normal.So that is a lot of bad stuff so you would think that this would obviously be a negative review however there actaully is a lot of good stuff as well.  Mainly in terms of the actual gameplay which I feel is what matters most.  2k has fixed a lot of the cheese from previous years and I really do feel like the game plays a lot smoother now and all of the animations look a lot better.  The high school and college games are actually done extremley well even though you dont get to play many games.  There is a lot of little details that they took the time to add that really add to the realism of the high school and college games.  You also have a lot more options to customize your player.  The practice mode and the other options of how to spend your off days is a really nice touch except for the fact that the practice mode is stuck in a side view camera that you cannot change (2k PLEASE FIX THIS) which makes some of the drills pretty much unplayable.  I also really like that you have the ability to see contracts from 3 different teams and try to haggle with them to get more vc and minutes.  Another thing I will add is that, in my opinion, the music in this game is a lot better than in previous 2k games.All in all, there is a lot of bad in this game but I do think 2k pulled through where it really matters which is in the actual gameplay.  And I think that the gameplay is actually so much better than every other 2k game that it makes up for the storyline cheese which is why I gave it a positive review.			"

												The people in this god damn mother ♥♥♥♥ing game are idiots. Spike Lee's storyline is total crap. It makes you an African American in Harlem, New York, no matter what race you are, and only has one story line. The highschool and college aspects of the game are trash as well. You get 3-4 games in each, and thats that. They only have 10 ♥♥♥♥in colleges to choose from (I only had ♥♥♥♥in 9). You also get 8 NBA GAMES PER ♥♥♥♥ING SEASON. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ 2K!!!??? WHY WOULD YOU LET SPIKE LEE RUIN ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MODES IN YOUR ♥♥♥♥IN GAME. This game also has 2 other modes that are absolute trash (because of the game itself, and all the ♥♥♥♥ing idiots that bought this game). My♥♥♥♥INGPark is god awful this year. All the idiots that go on for the PC can not ♥♥♥♥ing play at all. And when there are courts open and there are three other people in the park (if you're lucky) you might be able to play a game of 21 with them. But what do the ♥♥♥♥ing idiots on mypark do when I'm on. They go to other ♥♥♥♥ing games that have 4-6 player slots when there are 3 ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYERS IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. Also the Pro-Am is complete trash. There are never enough players that join the games to EVEN GET THEM STARTED. I only bought the pc version because I knew it was moddable, but after this, I am considering switching to my non-moddable PS4 for NBA 2K games. DO NOT BUY!			"

												New year, new NBA 2KXX...Ok, let's be brief and let's forget for a moment the most devastating, racist and stupid story ever produced for a videogame... also, let's forget the simple fact that the game is, at the end, an NBA 2K15 version with some absurd and useless ""improvements"" (like, the pre-match, the post-match, a lot of cash-grabbing useless accessories...).Is it the game fun? Quite, not as I expected.The control system is still a real pain, too simplified and too difficult at the same time.The animations are... strange! Sometimes they are decent, sometimes they're terrible.Just an example: if you manage to get past some useless story chapters, you'll see a scene where your ""mother"" has exactly the ""smile"" of Alien!Look, not kidding...Also, the game suffer for an incredible list of poor design choices and strange behaviours, that, for example, let you with a terrible shooting system (and, sadly, this is a problem that got worse, with this season game).At the end, not really worthy his price.

												It has its issues. MyCareer story was awfuly bad and cheesy. VC earnings are to low for the rating your player is when you enter the NBA. I don't mind having a 55 rating but come on 300-500 VC a game will take like 2-3 seasons to hit rating 80. Other than that gameplay is excellent as always and smooth as well. So if you are looking for a solid basketball game you can enjoy this is it.			"

												OVERVIEW:Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10MyCareer: 3/10MyPark: 8.5/10MyGM: N/ASTORY A.K.A MYCAREERWhat a story. Not. You don't get to play every game which is a huge negative (not sure how it was in other NBA games, but that's a big turn off). You only get to play eight games in your rookie season. I mean, what? Sorry? Nah, get outta here. Three quaters of the time I was on the bench, too. The actual 'storyline' wasn't too long either. However, the overall story was, how can I say it? Average. I've seen better stories, but I've also seen worse.As for the gameplay - top notch, can't fault it. I lag a little bit because of my specs, though. Anyone with good enough specs should be able to play this game at a high frame-rate no problem.Being as MyCareer is a big part of the game, I'm giving this game a negative review because it didn't stand up to expectations and could have been improved a lot more. The creative teams need to think long and hard to improve it for 2K17. However, everything else runs alright. What I have noticed & encountered are a lot of cheaters online. Which, again, is a big put off. If you want it just to play occassionaly, such as quick games and whatnot - go ahead. For the story? I wouldn't buy it after playing it. But hey ho.			"

												Bought the game when it went on sale on Jan 30, but have not been able to enjoy the game for 2 weeks.  Everytime I finish a Domination game on MyTeam I get an ''Arbitration is taking too long' error and I lose my game progress BUT I still use up my contracts.  I thought it was a minor blimp, maybe some server problems with the increase traffic because of the sale.  So I tried another game, and another, and another, and another...all still with the same error.  I tried to get a refund but was denied by Steam because I played over 2 hours on my each attempts.  I set up a ticket with 2k Support, this was 2 weeks ago when I started to have this problem, and they still have not came back with an answer, just running me around.  If you look through Reddit  or the Steam forums, you can see this is common for the PC version.			"

												I love the 2k series but I'm seriously considering not buying for PC next season if at all. First of all this release is extremely unstable and as usual 2k is slow to fix the bugs. I've been dealing with framerate issues from launch. They've patched it and now the issues seems to be isolated to playing career mode where the game fluxuates from running fine to speeding up to slowing down. I've tried playing the game with all of the graphical settings on low and I'm seeing the same results. Aside from the technical issues, I wasn't very happy with the opeing of career mode either. Going from high school to college then the NBA was cool but being forced to watch Spike Lee's preach story was not. I was forced to watch a 20 minute cutscene that I couldn't skip or pause? Ridiculous. I feel that the story had a good moral but came off as forced and preachy. Not to mention the game features another stereotypical portrayal of an Italian American with questionable character that Spike Lee is now becoming known for. I as an African American male can't support all of his views.On the gameplay front, 2K is still top notch. Controls are again improved. Excellent game on that count. However I'm hoping that another developer starts making A+ basketball games as 2K hasn't been forced to step it up since they have no competition. They need to stop releasing unfinished products.

												Being a huge Basketball fan I gotta say this game is a real disapointment, 2k really needs to take out there earbuds and just listen to the fans feedback and maybe they will be able to make something worth while. As you can see I played this game for over 100 hours which shows you my love for Basketball and lemme tell you a few of the many problems I've encountered. One some of the shots in this game is ridiculous, Playing as Michael Jordan he missed 12 out of the 20 shots he took in the game and all of his shooting attributes are over 90 which just adds to the ridiculousness. Also playing as Allen Iverson (the god of Ankle Breaking) he hasn't broken ankles barely at all no matter how many dribble moves I do. And don't get me started on the Small Forward and the Layups in this game, Even on Pro (Medium Difficulty) the opposing players play as if it were the playoffs, It's near impossible to get pass the defense hence you have to shoot 3 or mid shooters and like I said before they will miss easy even if you are WIDE OPEN and have a 90+ overall at shootings and even if you get a near perfect release, I man heck I missed a few even with a Perfect Green Release. Not only are these the issues but the game crashed a lot and I have a Windows 10 Alien Ware so I should be good. MyCareer is not as good as last year although there are some good aspects to it. If you try to send a ticket to 2k support they will mostly likely tell you the same thing they tell everyone else, Verify the Cache or redownload the game. All in all the 2k support service is trash. Now that I got that out of the way lemme get to the Pros. The graphics are amazing 2k does really well at graphics and there are a lot of things you can do such as play as a bunch of classic teams and players such as Jabbar and MJ. Really that's all the good stuff I can think of off the top of my head. All in all in conclusion the Cons outways the Pros and as you can see from the reviews above from User Reviews people will probally agree. I suggest you get 2k15 or just wait for 2k17.			"

												This game is complete garbage, it's not worth reviewing so I'll list a bunch of problems I have with it.The shots are a complete gamble, whether it's a wide open layup or a contested 3 pointer. It doesn't matter if you're Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, or Joel Anthony, you'll miss pretty much every shot. Even if you're wide open for 3 with a 99 overall 3 point shooter, you'll miss it most of the time. The AI literally shoots through you, and don't bother trying to defend the shot, you'll get a foul. According too 2k, players like Leandro Barbosa can make 360 layups THROUGH players like Moses Malone. It doesn't matter what your layup rating is, you'll miss them all. The. Time.My Career is complete garbage, you're forced to play as a stereotypical black guy from ""Da hood"". Even if you're white and make a white character, you have a ""twin"" black sister and black parents. You're forced to interact with a typical loud mouth black guy and you can't say ""Hey! I hate this guy! I want nothing to do with him!"" There's no choices in this god awful ""story"" so thanks piece of s**t Spike Lee, the only world and dream in his mind is all black. You're not ""Livin Da Dream"" you're living Spike Lee's stereotypical race obsessed world. Stay the hell away from 2k. And don't give me the whole ""Most video game characters are white"" because in this game, you're supposed to create your own character and play as him. I don't see any games where you create your character and you're forced to play as a certain race. Thank god you can skip most of the cutscenes and it only lasts one season. Speaking of the one season, it's your rookie season which is wasted since you only play 8 games. You also can't skip these games, or the high school/college games, so if you've played MyCareer before, you have to do the same thing again.The game is filled with hackers and 2k is doing NOTHING once again, people should stop supporting this terrible company. Say what you want about Live, but EA is actually improving the game. Sadly it's ""cool"" to hate EA so the biased ""reviewers"" give it a 5/10 or ignore it, and the blind sheep bash it. MyTeam is completely dead, I started Road To The Playoffs after completing Domination, and of course I can't get out of the 9th seed because the mode is dead. It's bad enough that I can't do a ""Head to Head"" and use my very good team, instead I'm stuck with dog s**t bronze players (they're the worst in the game) even though I have 6 amethyst players the rest being gold. I only managed to play one game, and it lagged like crazy! The shots were delayed, the FPS dropped to 30 during free throws (which were also delayed) and timeouts. It felt impossible for me to play defense, it felt very loose. The servers still suck, SURPRISE! As I said above the servers STILL suck and 2k isn't improving them.The animations are clunky, slow, stiff, and unresponsive. When you go up for layups you will either (A) Miss and your character slowly walks AWAY from the basket instead of grabbing the rebound, or (B) Miss and you jump multiple times because this god awful game can't register movement properly. It's impossible to play defense because the AI EASILY blows past you and you can't turn around in time to catch them.DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE GAME EVEN IF IT'S $10!!!! STOP SUPPORTING THIS GREEDY COMPANY OR THEY WON'T IMPROVE THE NEXT GAMES!!!!EDIT: Another big problem with this game is turnovers, if you try to dribble near a defender they'll steal it most of the time.

												The MyPlayer/MyCareer is jank. I'm as white as you can get. My parents and my twin sister are black. what the even heck. 2k also doesn't care at all about anything. I can't join friends, friends can't join me, there's no players in MyPark, and I can't buy anything from the store. The same stupid message pops up, saying something about how I can't connect when I'm obviously connected. It also gives me an error code to type in on the website.

												This game tried to do so many cool things but all of them are buggy as all hell. You'll jump for rebounds and half the time it clips through you and goes to the guy you boxed out or the AI will just throw you behind and them even though you're in front of them.Also, if you like them to poke out the ball in the most ridiculous ways that make no sense along with more clipping to go along with it to help cause that problem.You'll also miss good shots all the time. Like too much of the time. I've missed 16 shots in a row that were all great shots that were in my strong zone.I just can't give a good review to a game that has so many issues as much as I play it. it's bugginess is just bad....Also the Turnovers from the AI ARE TERRIBLE!  They literally are telepathic mind readers just an FYIYou're character also has a lack of hands. half the time the balls just bounces through his hand without grabbing the ball at all. Bad mechanicsAlso the refs are blind half the time. Especially when it's a player with a decent rating they will get away with a lot of fouls. In a game? right? idk explain to me why I hear a loud smack on my player and the ref acts like nothing happenedAny player considered good also will make you miss 90% of your shots. Just by staring at youThere's LITERALLY an Endless list of ♥♥♥♥ wrong with this game. Buy it on sale if you absolutley have to have it.There's a reason that this game's negative is above 50%. They got really lazy and just plain pooped on their good ideas.The controls are terrible.Your guy will fumble about like a bumbling ♥♥♥♥en retard every time you try to do something.

												Easily the worst NBA 2K to be released since 2K12. The dribble moves this year are awful and useless, pick and rolls don't work most of the time, plays are clunky and bad, and the AI defense is godlike. MyCareer is bad, once again you just get lackluster teammates and you can't do anything useful without buying VC or playing other gamemodes for hours to earn it because your character starts at a 55 overall which is a joke. Not bothering with this game anymore, the gameplay is simply terrible and anyone who states otherwise is playing on Rookie or Pro difficulty. I wish I could get my money back for this; I've been playing every NBA 2K game since 2012 and this one is genuinely the worst.			"

So far Ive encountered serious interface complexity, and in game bugs which ive had to troubleshoot. I havent played much, a few games.. but in my 3rd game the court was not a court. It was a black rectangle i was playing on.. I checked and found that its a bug that has been reported for quite some time yet nothing has been done to fix it, also found a control bug which wouldnt let me exit the game, had to ctrl alt delete several times..

												In an interactive media form such as gaming, the my career story has no level of interactivity.  The other characters say that the choice for certain things is all yours but in the end, Spike Lee makes the choices for you and you are just along for the long drawn out CGI movie of a story mode. ( the story is actually a watchable movie at the end.)   Once I saw that, I knew that none of my choices would change the story at all.  This story mode was a bore to play.  Mechanics of the game are good but I guess no one had the courage to stand up to Spike and tell him that the story mode was just straight up bad.  Story Mode: 3/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall 5.5/10I'm going to not recommend this game at the full retail price.  I got it for half off so I can't complain about that too much but for $60, I don't think enough innovation has been made to justify that.			"

												Game is beautiful, runs well at 4k resolution and the classic teams are great as well.I liked the game from what I played of it.  If you are a fan of the current NBA roster and teams might be good for you to pick up.However, for me, I'm just going to stick to 2k11.  As I'm not a pro at the game, and I'm not interested in my player, just team vs team and doing franchise seasons of 83 games 2k11 works for me still.That game runs at 4k, still looks quite good, though not as realistic as 2k16.I'm too casual of a player of NBA games to jump to this version. It piqued my interest because of the Michael Jordan edition, however for an MJ experience 2k11 still wins in that regard with Jordan challenges and the teams included.I usually buy a 2K bball game every 5 years as usually enough has changed by that time for the game to feel very fresh for me.Maybe I'll buy 2k17 next year, depends on the changes.

I have a GTX titan x card and the game just lags and crashes .I can't play online due to they crappy ♥♥♥ sever once again, i get a error code when trying to connect online. No VC code was giving to me when i pre-order the game. For what i'm reading. There are 99 overall players in my park which make online playing very pointless now.  I'm done with the PC version of 2k basketball games. They don't care about us.  I'm going to take my L and buy the ps4 version next year.			"

												This is the first basketball game I've played in a long time and it is a great basketball game, but the career mode really sucks and game support is nil. Since the last windows update server connectivity is gone and you can't for some reason play your career mode without being online. I bought it for $5 in a bundle with other 2k games and I'm still disappointed. I can't imagine how bad it is for people who paid $80.			"

												Bought it today because its on sale.. HUGE bball fan and a big gamer, This game is awful. The detail and graphics are great. But thats all I like. So far Ive encountered serious interface complexity, and in game bugs which ive had to troubleshoot. I havent played much, a few games.. but in my 3rd game the court was not a court. It was a black rectangle i was playing on.. I checked and found that its a bug that has been reported for quite some time yet nothing has been done to fix it, also found a control bug which wouldnt let me exit the game, had to ctrl alt delete several times.. Basically super messy and buggy. 2k cares about getting paid but doesnt seem to fix issues which they are aware of.			"

												In an interactive media form such as gaming, the my career story has no level of interactivity.  The other characters say that the choice for certain things is all yours but in the end, Spike Lee makes the choices for you and you are just along for the long drawn out CGI movie of a story mode. ( the story is actually a watchable movie at the end.)   Once I saw that, I knew that none of my choices would change the story at all.  This story mode was a bore to play.  Mechanics of the game are good but I guess no one had the courage to stand up to Spike and tell him that the story mode was just straight up bad.  Story Mode: 3/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall 5.5/10I'm going to not recommend this game at the full retail price.  I got it for half off so I can't complain about that too much but for $60, I don't think enough innovation has been made to justify that.			"

												The pre-game show, the interviews and pretty much any ""story"" or non-gameplay element in this game really drag it down. You cannot take this game seriously when each game starts off with some crappy analysis by a horribly modeled Shaq with unsynched voice over. Hell, even the tutorials are basically videos of gameplay voiced by unenthuastic pro players reading off a script. You can't understand what they're saying because they're basically mumbling. The money they spent getting pros to do voiceovers would have better been spent on quality programmers, because the game runs like crap, the online is unplayable and none of the instant replays, ""slam cams"" or Man of the Game cut scenes work. With that said, the gameplay is pretty solid as usual but nothing new from the previous NBA2K games.			"

Online play is always a huge risk because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I completely turned away from this game because this bug kept ♥♥♥♥ing my ♥♥♥♥ up.

												Seeing as how I have 850 hrs in 2k16, I feel I have played the game to warrant a full opinion and review on this product. This review will cover multiple aspects of the game, and will hopeufully serve as a guideline so that others can refer to it when necessary. With that being said, i'd like to stress that this review will focus heavily of the woes of the game, particularly for the PC audience. This review will cover 3 main topics: Gameplay, Gamemodes, and Community, as well as final comments and extra's. Each topic will then be scored out of 10, and at the bottom will be my conclusion as well as a TL;DR statement. Lets begin.Gameplay: While the game's movement system is flawed at times, for the most part your controlled character is able to move fluidly and resembles the real thing. In game controls differ slightly from previous 2k games, but its nothing you can't learn relatively quickly. In regards to animations, the game claimed that ""you would never be locked into an animation again"" but that is simply not the case. there are countless times when you go up for a dunk, but your character will just throw the ball across the backboard, resulting usually in the other team grabbing aan easy 2 points. Animations can somethimes go a bit wonky, but for the most part it looks good. the same options that are available in previous games are available, and the game can be customized to fit how you want to play. There have also been multiple patches to the game, most of which are needed to fix game breaking bugs (See reviews below regarding Win10 bug) the gameplay is solid, but it leaves a bit to be desired. my score for the gameplay would be a mediocre 6.5/10.Gamemodes and Online Functionality: NBA 2k16 features a plethora of gamemodes, each providing a different and fun experience... to console players. PC contains the same features that are present on console, however, with such a small player base, it is near impossible to find an online game in any mode other than MyPark. Modes like MyLeague (Previously Association), MyTeam, and Play Now Online all contain an online aspect, but it is barely played as there are not many players that aare participating ONLINE in those gamemodes. (These gamemodes are still fun in a local setting, but you are not playing 100% of the game) It is because of this lack of online functionality that I didnt fully enjoy my purchase. The gamemodes in 2k16 are great fun, earning an 8.5/10, but the online sections of the modes failed miserably, earning only a 2.5/10.Community: Many players within the community are extremely helpful, and some can offer great advice and have a strong opinion regarding the state of the game. The PC community is paricularly special as we don't condone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from devs.  if your game sucks, we will tell you.however ther is a section of the community that spols it for the majority, and that would be hackers and cheaters, of which there is a significant margin of players that do so. Hackers ruin the game for so many, an its a shame that they exist, but the main cause that they do is that the devs have a terrible anti-cheat system, sometimes even banning those that did not commit any sort of unjust act. in addition to hackers and cheaters, there are also scammers that will attempt to trade with another member of the community, just so they can cheat them out of a card. iit is because of these types of people that the community is not where it should be just yet, and why i have to give the community a 6.5/10.TL;DR: All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone wanting to pickup a basketball sim. Rather, I would suggest you acquire this game by other means. If, at that point, you decide that you want to play modes such as MyTeam, and MyPark, even though they have a dwindling player base, then purchase. As of right now, this game is not for PC players, because it lacks suport in that area. I hope this review was able to inform potential buyers. Peace out ganstas.			"

												Its all about the story right ? Well that's the career mode and going right there like I always have when I get a new 2k game, im greeted with a story more so. Not gonna go into a review of the story, the story line, or the overall format of the game mode, my problem will and always be the god awful skill level they stick you at. Don't you dare make me play highschool games, college games, and then go into the leage at the same skill level throughout all three. EVERY YEAR THEY GIVE YOU A POS PLAYER TO PLAY IN THE NBA!!! Me sitting on my computer chair am litteraly as this guy they give me to play NBA basketball and thats so freaking stupid! Dont make me play those pointless pre NBA games without letting me get into the NBA at a half good skill level, it's a joke,			"

												NBA 2K16, on the PC.Well, its a amazing game.  I played NBA 2K since Iverson was on the cover.The graphics are amazing on this game.There's MyCareer, people are giving this alot of hate because if you make your Player white he still is sounding as an African American. I dont have any problems with this and I dont know why people are making a really big problem of this Just get over this. Are you playing 2K16 for the sound of your player? Or do you want to play some basketball. MyPark is good actually. I thougt that if you're playing on the PC, you will not find any players on the park. But there are some people. But I recommend you playing with friends. Ofcourse you can play with randoms, but I can guarentee you that you will rage. Since people dont pass and have no teamwork. And think that they are Stephen/Lebron or ma boi Paul George.Dont even think that you can hoop in my park alone and dont even pass to your teammate. Be a nice teammate and help each other and dont do things solo. If you want your Rep dropped. There are some annoying things in MyPark... 1. Its really hard to find a game if your a Rookie, since everyone just leaves if you join the 'next spot'. They think a rookie cant hoop.2. There is lag/glitches.3. This is my opinion but the taunting is really annoying, If you take a L ( Loss) on my park all your opponents are going to be in front of you and just taunting you. And you just have to accept it :(.MyTeam:What else can I say? its actually good really fun has a nice FIFA Ultimate Team feeling.Pro-Am: I never had a chance to play it on PC. But I played it on XBOX. The problem with Pro-Am is that its actually really hard to find some people when I join Pro-Am I just see 2 people. Or is that me? I'll update this when I get a chance to play it.You can customise everything.You can change your player from head to toe, you can even change your Court.PlayNow: What can I say?Performance: No problems,  some lag on MyPark and the other Online modes.Should you get it?:NBA 2K17 is coming out soon, and If I was you, just get this game cause if you really want a good basketball games just get this and play MyPark till 2K17 comes out. Dont even try Live 16. Just get this. At full price: No :(.Finisher:I give this game a 8/10, fix the glitches/lag 2K.  "

												I haven't played a NBA game since xbox 360. I picked this up on steam summer sale. Game is littered with microtransactions. Feels like you are playing a brick of a character. Going down the court side to side with someone or even infront? Nope hes bodying you the whole way slowing you to the basket. Career mode is probably the worst thing I've ever played in my life. Just wait til draft. It's five minutes of them drafting til you can continue. Why is there so many unskippable cut scenes???? Seriously? I picked this game up to play basketball not watch a cutscene simulator.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed NBA 2K16.I played NBA 2K13 on my WII and I was amazed, but 2K did much more in NBA 2K16.My Player-The story is okay, which is different from most reviewers that hated the story. I liked the aspect of having a family and all, but, I'm not a racist or anything, you don't choose the color of your family. My character's color is different from his family. Also, you can only play 8 games in your rookie season. However, you do get to play in high school and college.My Team-I never played My Team on NBA 2K13 on my WII because it wasn't a feature. I did like My Team, but it encourages people to spend more money to get better players. It challenged me because I don't have a controller so no perfect releases for me. It was good, though. I do have a terrible team, but it is a money grabber.My GM/My League-I don't know how many of you watch CSB YT, but I do. I really have wanted to ""rebuild"" teams in NBA 2K16. I'm an avid basketball fan, so I was really excited. It's easy to do but it is very fun and creative to give you a simulation of what it is like to be an owner of a team. Who should you sign? Who should you trade? Who should you draft? Etc. I really enjoyed My GM/My League.Play Now-I liked Play Now. I enjoyed playing as my favorite teams online against other people and their favorite teams. I notice that most people choose the Cavaliers or the Warriors, but I like playing as low seeded playoff teams or non-playoff teams like the Bulls and the Jazz.Online-Heck yeah! Online is great! I was able to download new rosters, new draft classes, and was able to play online cleanly! You could do a lot online!Overall Score-This game was very good. It's not a 10/10 game, but I would rate it 9/10! Very enjoyable and fun!			"

												MyCareer 2k15>2k16Ok, so I bought the game on the release. It didn't work. I couldn't play the game for atleast a month. I had to be in touch with the customer service with 3-4 diffenrent people which got annoying during time because I had to explain what I had done etc. to each person. The fault was 2Ks. They fixed the bugs after awhile so I could play and I was disapointed.I am playing MyCareer only and loved the nba 2k15 MyC, it was visually good, gameplay was fun and you could be the hero who made the shots that were ment to actually go in. This year I desided to make a Shooting Guard, who was just focused on shooting. My SG is now 81 overall, 85 shooting, 50layup, passing 40 or something.1. Shooting (85). I can't make any shots that are open. This shooter shouldn't be in the nba, fact. I haven't even tried to do contact shots since I can't even make open shots. (tried different animations Kobe, Klay and some free ones. Didn't have any impact. Simulation, default, casual doesn't matter. I tried if the sliders worked, nothing. And I'm playing on Superstar, im no rookie, HoF in 2k15)2. Layups. This guy should definetly not be in the nba. This guy misses every layup even on a fast break alone and he manages to miss a layup. 50 layup shouldn't be that critical on that point.3. Passing. Man I can make every pass. Don't boost your passing skill since it is useless. (Unless you want to make traffic lobs)4. Dripple. It's so sluggish. Dripple is extremely hard because the guy doesn't follow your controls at all. (Can be fixed with dirrenent animations, maybe? But if this is true, 2K, delete the rest of the animations because they are useless so stop making more of them)Spike Lee start off was kinda boring since it didn't have any inpact on the gameplay, just some random cutscenes.2K, You really don't have to make the game more ""realistic"" with the scoring % because it makes the game extremely unrealistic when you can't make buckets that even I would do under preassure and exhaustion. I don't even play basketball. 2k15 to 2k16 was just a cheese fix patch.If you are considering buying this game, don't do it. Online is fun but if you want to play MyCareer it will ♥♥♥♥ you the f off. 2k15 was great and I'm going to start playing that instead of this. Maybe 2k17 will be better, who knows? Listen to the community before you buy it though. I wasted my 50e and I actually regret it.NBA fan from Finland			"

												The gameplay is beautiful but this game has so many bugs. Since I bought NBA 2K16 I have only had issues. Servers taking to long to process, problems with coins, cannot proceed in MyTeam Domination etc. Will not buy NBA 2K from steam again, due to these issues. Cannot recommend.			"

												Was really enjoying the NBA My Career mode. However, after you finish the storyline part and begin the meat of the career,  a major issue occurs. When playing the games in My Career, you will get to the end of the game and choose Advance to get to the next day of the season. Unfortunately, this causes the game to crash for me. When you restart, you have to play the game over again....and...another crash. There is a major thread on Steam and appears related to the latest patch. Unfortunately, it is still unresolved as I write this (started in May, now it is August). So while the gameplay is fun, the features are limited and ultimately leads to a thumbs down.			"

												Comment conseiller un jeu où le système de shoot te fait croire que tu contrôles le tir alors que ça rentrera quand ça en aura envie ? Comment faire passer un jeu où il est impossible de faire une p*tin de passe à un coéquipier devant toi ? Comment s'amuser avec une IA conne comme une botte de foin carbonisée ?Je ne parlerais pas du mode histoire qui est consternant, tout le monde le sait et ce n'est pas la peine de s'étendre dessus, mais le reste est horriblement foireux: des personnages qui marchent à deux à l'heure et comme des crabes, une interface qui mérite la lapidation avec des boites de cassoulet, un button mapping qui est une suite d'absurdités et de non-ergonomie ...Bref, gigantesque déception, si c'est le top des jeux de basket c'est uniquement parce qu'il n'y a rien d'autre. :(			"

												This game is huge. There are lots of different things to do, different playmodes, everything from single player to multiplayer, to fantasy draft teams and realistic seasons.EDIT: I am changing this review into a negative one, because a recent patch to fix an exploit broke the player icons, where they stopped showing. It is now impossible to do icon passing, pick and rolls and other passing as there are no icons indicating which player you are emphasizing on. Actually game-breaking.Why I like it the most is that it seems as a realistic simulation of a basketball game. It's hard, but in a rewarding way. You can learn and get better: there are tactics to take care of, learn how various players play best, practice complex offense and defence strategies, learn how to do combos to score. There are seemingly endless possibilities, and the customization of every single match-up seems endless, if that is what you want. The story part of the game is a little weird though: you can customize your character, but no matter what, you will have a twin sister who is black. If you chose a different race, it can take away some of the immersion..The game crashes a few times in the menus, and a few of the cut-scenes were a bit laggy. But the game plays smoothly and fine, and I haven't experienced anything game-breaking. Note that it is absolutely essential to play with controller. It also works really well to do local coop with two controllers. I suggest it to every basketball fan, without any doubts.			"

												Ya know, after NBA 2k15 (which was IMO the best basketball game made in a long time) I was very excited for this game.  I read the reviews, which a lot of them were negative.  Well, I have major regrets that I didn't listen to the reviews.  THIS GAME IS FLAT OUT HORRIBLE!!!  It seems like the devolopers spent all their time on the story portition & no time at all on the actual game play of the game.  The game play is just awful!  The players move very slow, which means you will lose your guy on defense very easliy (even in turbo mode).  The controller settings are a little different from 2k15, so you'll have to get used to them.  When you pick your player on the court, it feels like you're a robot & not a player.  NBA 2k15 was much different.  You felt like an actual player on the court and were a part of the game, not just some robot running around (slowly) not doing much.  I was going to return it, but I thought maybe I was being to critical, so I gave it more and more chances.  Now I can't return it, and I will most likely go back to NBA 2k15.  This pisses me off, because I want the roster to be up to date, but I guess I gotta sacrafice a new roster for better (a lot better) gameplay.  I don't know what the developers were thinking releasing this crap.  Next time I'm going to listen to the reviews...  ;(			"

												Absolute trash. If you want to spend money on a basketball game, get 2k13. I'm not quite sure how the algorithms work for this game, but in My Career mode, as the Golden State Warriors, we can cream the cavs or pacers or clippers, but when it comes to playing the bucks or 76ers your team cannot even hit open jumpers! I was up 15 points at the half, I got out of the game for 6 minutes and we were down by 10. 6 minutes!!!! This game is also trash because when you get caught in an animation there's nothing you can do, if yopur guy decides to cross twice, he'll just lose the ball to a center. Absolute trash, these devs were only worried about flashy content, not stuff that would actually improve gameplay. 2k blows, I wish I could have a refund!			"

												Having been a huge NBA 2K fan (I have put in more than 100 hours into each iteration for the past 6 years), this years is a HUGE disappointment.  The new soap opera that is My Player is beyond corny and unrelatable.  The one thing that this games is supposed to be about is basketball, however in the first season I was only allowed to play 8 games and had what felt like 3 hours of unwatchable cutscenes.  The lack of playing has left my player still in the 50's as I am unable to improve the player if I can't play with him.  I've only played this game for a handful of hours but I am ready to uninstall and spend my time on something that I will actually enjoy.  I kept coming back to this series due to the MyPlayer mode, however this year you have the least control over your player and they made it a joke.  Unless this changes goodbye NBA 2K.			"

												Bought this game expecting a lot more than I actually got. I expected the graphics to be a lot better, but they are actually pretty bad, it doesn't run in 1080p which bothers me because there is a lot of pixel work you can see. Also the game is really buggy and it's hard for me to get through cut scenes in the game without it glitching or freezing. There is also a lot of bugs in this game, like the sound cutting out and the commentators voices stop playing. Also the online portion of this game is absolutely horrible, majority of the people hack on this game and you have to face people who are taller, faster and stronger than you and it just sucks. Basically, I bought this game expecting it to be better and I just really didn't like it at all. If you're thinking of buying this game, and are looking at the reviews for it, I suggest not buying it. It is a waste of money to buy on PC. If you are really in to basketball and like the NBA series, I suggest buying it for console, it would be 10x better. I was one of the people who read the reviews but yet still decided to buy it, don't be like me and waste your money. This game is not going to be anything like you expected it to be, DON' BUY IT!

												initially the game are OK. and i am rating the game as the best ever NBA game that i ever played. but once the PC patch file arise, the players are without shoe, accesories, and some mplayers are even naked (without jersey). this must be a joke. i hv posted this at the NBA 2K facebook page, but somehow, there is no response. the game is not cheap, but i value the hardwork behind it. hence, i view it as a good quality game deserve for a reasonable price for a consumer to pay. but this really make me dissapointed. i am unable to play my NBA 2K16 for 2 days. and hope that for whatever reason 2K franchise is going to give, please ensure my game is fix and no such issue arise in the future. coz for what i know, patch files are for rectification or enhancement, definately is not causing for extra issue.

												Updated:  Dear NBA 2k16,     ♥♥♥♥ you too.  I pre-ordered the Jordan Version for 80 dollars....  They did not provide promised pre-order bonus because apparently they can write whatever they want on the store page and than not deliver but that's ok apparently.  I have owned many versions of your product (this is my 3rd just on steam) and let me tell you this will be the last.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  This company is a bunch of lying scheming scumbags who ♥♥♥♥ over people who buy there product.  I WANT MY PROMISED PRE-ORDER BONUS YOU ♥♥♥♥S.  I also want MYCAREER not Spike Lees trashbag story.  No offense to Spike Lee and go knicks but you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s have ruined MyCareer mode (my favorite ofc) and turned it into a trashbag story mode full of hammy cutscenese with NO ABILITY TO DECIDE.  Even the couple of schools they offer you are always the same.  I want to play for Duke or Kentucky but ofc I can't but its ""My""Career right?  Hardly....  Now the bonus for the MJ $80 pre-order...  I got 30k VC Pablo Prigioni, Nene and some other ♥♥♥♥ player... WTF????  Wasnt I supposed to get Emeralds????  Really? ♥♥♥♥ing Pablo Prigioni is a pre-order bonus? Even the Jordan they give you is crappy for Jordan.  Literally I feel like NBA 2k went out of its way to hose players.  In summation ♥♥♥♥ YOU TOO 2k....  You want to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over your best customers (the ones I shelled out $80 so you can bend them over and ♥♥♥♥ em good dont be surprised when NBA 2k 17 sales fall flat.  I honestly was a lock to buy this game every year but having been ♥♥♥♥ed over this hard they are on my ♥♥♥♥ list w/ Sony and I will not be purchasing any more of there products.  So ♥♥♥♥ you 2k and ♥♥♥♥ you Sony (had to sneak it in they ♥♥♥♥ed me a few years back and I have not forgotten and sold my Playstation and all games).  P.S.  If you actually stop being toolbags and give the players the pre-oder bonus THAT YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S promised (my missing emerald cards and VC and crap) I would consider buying you product next year.  NOT Pre-oder mind you as this was outright a FIASCO but if you make amends and reviews come in strong I would consider.  But if stays as is than ♥♥♥♥ YOU TOO I will never buy anything you make.			"

												Wellcome to the bad ports of 2015 ""the home stretch"". -bad optimization-Cheats/hackers-Buggy buggy buggy beta.-my career controversy.-TL;DR; Bad port, buggy, bad servers, dont buy until patch or serious saleIts not new for nba2k to value PC gamers the least. We get almost no support, no online control to stop the 99cheats. Dodgy servers and from nba2k15 they started to Optimize the game for pc pretty awefull. I am running a pretty deasent geforce gtx 970 4gigs, i5 cpu, 8gigs ram gaming rig. This game tanks with standard settings, you have to go in turn of vsync super sample, and buffering to get something playable (still hard to maintain that 60fps). That combined alot of people are reporting crashed and freezing games with loss of progression. I myself are having a lovely bug that a reinstall wont fix, where i have no commentators after 1min of play every quater, and sometimes the crowd goes away also, it gets a bit... silent on them 12min quaters. Lastly alot of people is complaining about mycareer being diffrent, the big issue here is that the story is designed for this 1 specifik guy, and not you. They could have easely made it so that you family changed race depending on you, made you choose your own nickname.. all that said and done, the player progression and ranking on winning highschool games, to get diffrent scholarships, and playing well in colledge to get draftet higher is one of the best way the game has handled the preseasen i think. and after your rookie season you get the nba2k16 mycareer with alot more features, so concluding that mycareer is the best it has ever been, but 2k needs to know that a movie directer, havent got a clue what makes a story good for a video game.

												Worth it if you mostly want to play Singleplayer. Runs butter smooth at 144FPS for me. Online is kinda OK, but some modes are pretty dead on PC. Has its flaws, but still the best Sportsgame on PC by far! But don't forget, when 2K17 comes out in September 2016 2K16 will be pretty much dead and the Servers will be shut down sometime in 2017.

												It's not a terrible game, in my opinion its quite good. But the gameplay seems a bit choppy and the lag is very odd, one half it lags when I'm playing on defense and the next half when I'm on offense. That can be fixed so its not that big an issue.The MyCareer story is a bit much. I'm not black, but I was raised by a black family, with a black twin. I enjoy MyCareer actually having a story line, it gives it a sense of creativity, but it would be better if it can relate to other nationalities. It's weird being Asian and being surrounded by a black family, calling me ""Freq."" So far I just decided to commit to Kansas State, #Jayhawk lmao, so I don't what else to expect from the story. 2K is taking a step in the right direction with the story, instead of the straight-foward: play the rookie showcase for your draft stock. Once 2K can make a better story and not ♥♥♥♥ up w/ lag, they will truly make a work of art. But so far, NBA 2K16 is just eh.			"

												Do you enjoy crazy long load times?Do you enjoy watching long cutscenes in MyCareer about a guy that is supposed to be you but has an African American voice and family even if you aren't African American? Even going so far as to have your sister be your twin?Do you enjoy a forced simulated high school college and even nba career where you play 4-8 games per season?Then go ahead and get this game and play MyCareer. By far the dumbest thing to be in a basketball game I've ever played. Spike Lee is an idiot.All of the other features in this game are great and i'm getting a lot of playing time out of them. But i have always enjoyed MyCareer and I didn't make it even halfway through my rookie NBA season before i stopped. Based on MyCareer mode, dont touch this game with a 20 foot pole. If you are ok with not playing MyCareer, the steam sale right now is an excellent deal.			"

												Day 1 of release (will keep my review updated for a bit)I was expecting so much from this game only to be let down.Cant play this game on maxed out graphic settings which blows... Spike Lee's My Career Story Mode thing is meh... I feel its focused so much on cutscenes and the story instead of the gameplay. This is the first time i bought NBA for PC over console and i regret it lol. Alls I can say is. Its been almost 10 years since I played a NBA Live game and I think it might be time to give it a try again....Update 9/30/15After getting through year 1 of career mode of spike lee's trash story I am finally starting to enjoy the game. They added a lot of new features since I last played this series (2k14). Still not worth $60 tho			"

												The basketball so far has been excellent.  The story in My Career has not.  Anyone familiar with Spike Lee's previous work can guess what it is: Preachy ghetto story that has been told 1000 times.  The whole thing is just very very cheesy.  All credit to the actors for trying to salvage the script, but they really had their work cut off for them.I've just realised the first 3 lines of my review sound like a review on iMDB.  So..... basketball.It's a lot more fluid, the players have a better sense of weight, and it just feels right.  Controls have been changed quite a bit with more passing options, and after a while I really like the change.Presentation is very good, and I love the post game show (whenever I quit early Shaq seems to give me a filthy look).Sound is a bit wonky though, and I have had a few odd bugs where the sound goes a bit mental.  Otherwise, it's technically fine turned up to the max.If you love basketball you'll enjoy this.  If you can suffer through the god awful story the My Career is actually quite engaging.  Thankfully you can skip the cutscenes.Oh, and get used to being called Freak (Freq? whatever).I mean seriously Spike. Frequency Vibrations?  Really?  I swear you ran a competition in local primary schools and a local 8 year old kid thought that up.  At least I hope that's the reason.Signing off as I'm ranting.			"

												Cant figure out the reasoning behind the bad reviews. The visual are gorgeous, animations on every level are top notch, controls feel fluid, my team mode is great and even season mode is cool. The only things I dont like are that you cant use a controller on multiplayer matches which is understandable I guess but they should give the other player the option to make that decision. The story/my player mode is fun but very bland and you have to build your player up from nothing. Overall though its the best basketball game to date.sorry after some peoples help you can use the controller for multiplayer in big picture mode			"

												Let me start off by saying the reviews for this game are really unfair. Yes MyCareer has flaws but not enough to cause all these negative reviews. (I just started playing on PC, I've played console mostly) Here are the pros and cons imo.Pros1. Graphics look amazing. I have a 400$ laptop and if not for my screen resolution the game would look really nice. I have to run it on fairly low settings though.2. Gameplay out of this world.3. Presentation is just so good. Feels like a real NBA game when playing.4. So many customizable options. MyGm allows relocation and customizable stadiums with tons of options. You can even create your own shoe. The amount of options are almost over the top.5. Gamemodes are fantastic. MyCareer lets you play as an actual college team and play in the 2015 NCAA Championship against Wisconsin (and they have Kaminsky and Dekker lol)Cons1. You are basically forced to be black in MyCareer. Your Family and biological twin sister are black. And if you do choose a white character it looks kinda wierd.2. You are called Freq all the time and on game commentary. It would be nice if we could choose between a few nicknames at least. (I get that if you were called by your players name, it would be hard technologically speaking.3. 8 Games your Rookie season in MyCareer. Worst part of the entire game. Forget about impressing as a rookie. 2k forces you to sim most of the games. Pathetic thought process by 2k. 4. Your stats are terrible to start out with. During high school and college you are hyped to be the next NBA allstar. However, you enter the league as an 57 overall. Makes no sense.5. MyCareer in general. I still find it as a fun gamemode just because I like sports but I can see why people hate it. (Plus I have a low attention span to stick out through full games.In conclusion, as long as MyCareer isn't the only reason you play the game, there are still so many more options and gamemodes. My personal favorite is MyGm.			"

												Never thought this game was this good.I always wanted to play a NBA 2K.. game. But spending 50 euros is a bit much for me.So when the game was in sale. I Tried it. And since then I'm addicted to this game. And cannot stop playing it. Nice meme for putting an IGN quote in the thumbnail.Getitng in was weird. Since I was only used to play fifa where you can faceroll defend by holding one button LMAO. But here you really have to time the jumps to defend. And react fast. MyPlayer career with Spike Lee is very interesting. Feels like a movie for some reason. Playing online. Teaming up with other players picking a court etc. It's really fun. Graphically this game is very nice. People that have played 2K15 and disliked this game. I can't really give an opinion on that. Mainly because this is my first NBA 2K game. But if you like a sports game. Basketball game. I really recommend this.+++++++++ENABLE DJ KHALED PLAYLIST IF YOU ARE PLAYING THE GAME+++++++++++++			"

												The game sucks if you're someone like me who spends most of the time in my carrier, which is more than half of the players.It's very detailed, but a lot of the basics are terrible, for example the cutscenes... oh god the cutscenesHalf of the play time will be watching those cutscenes, which are unskipable, and that makes playing an entire season very long... two times as longNBA JAM is MORE FUN than 2k16, and when a game that is 44 gb size is less fun than a game from 1993 that's saying something			"

												Im for real, i only play/watch football but i always loved basketball. Never watched it, didnt care about it, but since this game was for 10euros i should give it a try.Was the best thing i did, seriously. Im addicted to this game.Now i care about NBA, now i watch NBA, now NBA is ""my sport"".This is maybe one of the best games ive ever played in my life. I have fun, its hard, its competitive, you have an objective to conquer and you have to work hard for it. I only play MyCareer, the story is not 10/10 but i would give it 7/10.The gameplay (since its my first NBA game) isnt that hard but isnt that easy, i would give it a 9/10.The graphics i would give it a 8/10, 2K should really work on those faces.The only thing i have agaisnt this game is that i cant find any players in MyPark, maybe cuz im new to the game and i dont understand how to connect, idk, and when you finish a game ( Only happens to me on MyCareer) sometimes the game wont save and it will automatically shutdown and you have to play the game againIn general this game is a 8.5/10 but seriously, BUY IT if you have a chance or if you want to try it. You will have tons of fun			"

												The story mode is probably a top 5 entry to my list of worst stories ever, this includes every movie and every game, tv show, book, commercial ect. that ive ever read/watched.Spike Lee did a extremely horrible job, full with smug references and pathetic attempts to be a hip director.The 2k team probably drooled themseves wet when Spike Lee agreed to do this ♥♥♥♥-story, because it looked like it would be a great addition. It turned out to be a racist, smug and just as pathetic as Jimmy Fallon when he tries to make his guests funnier by doing that patethic gestures while laughing at thier bad jokes.Pathetic typical-hollywood pice of ♥♥♥♥.The rest of the game, excluding 2kTV is good though.

												2016 is a mix of the good and the bad. The basketball is good and worth the 12 bucks I paid for it.The bad... 2K, change your number and never let Spike Lee look at another 2K product. Living DA Dream? If you can't English, you can't direct. Be less racist! Some of us white people like basketball too. Your story is VERY exclusive. Not that it would be a very good game, but it would be like making a game about astrophysicists and making the family white or Asian and Neil deGrasse Tyson playing it and saying ""WTF? I'll take my degree in physics from Harvard and my doctorate in astrophysics from Columbia and you can take a hike!"" The only way you can salvage it is pretending the sister is your hot girlfriend and her parents just have an unusually close relationship with the main character...Also the intro is too long and can't be skipped. Last night I made a second player and instead of sitting through it, I did laundry... doing laundry is better than the intro.... think about that for a moment....I like the GM mode.

												Coming from someone who put around 600 hours into 2k15, NBA2k16 is the best and most complete sports game I have ever played. It has it's bugs and issues, but it is the most real to life version of NBA 2k ever.PROS-2k did a great job this year of reducing the ""cheese"" in every way (It is VERY hard to draw charges, run baseline for an easy 2, or pull up for a contested 3 and knock it down for example)-You feel like you are in complete control of your players much more than last year, mainly because you rarely are ever stuck in animations-It isn't easy to score. This might sound bad, but this makes the game so much better. As I'm sure some people remember in 2k15, RT+X to the basket or shooting a 3 with any half decent 3pt shooter gave you a free basket.-Excellent graphics, the best looking sports game I have ever seen.-Fluid and varied gameplay, overall fun to play with many different modes, difficulties, and playstyles-Much better connection to servers/lag issues than previous years-Music/overall atmosphere- pregame/postgame show with Shaq, Ernie, and Kenny is great. The music is a wide variety of genres and cultures, mainly hip-hop and rap however so if you arent into that kind of music you can turn it off-Lots of settings/options, very customizeable and in some gamemodes you can even adjust gameplay sliders (percentage of 3's going in for example)-VERY ACCURATE RATINGS. This is so important, because many cards last year had extremely over-boosted ratings, which contributed a lot to the ""cheese""CONS-Some framerate issues, especially in cutscenes, but I have a 750 ti and I'm doing fine framerate wise with some medium, some high settings-""BE THE STORY"" except all you do in mycareer is follow the exact storyline Spike Lee has laid out for you, rarely being able to ever make your own decisions-Sometimes the game can be frusturating, players missing wide open shots when it seems like you should make it or things like that-Lots of bugs unrelated to gameplay, cards having the wrong ratings (Rookie vince carter has the same ratings as the 15+years later vince carter) and other things like that, but im sure these will be fixedOverall- 9/10, I really recommend this game to anyone who remotely enjoys basketball, I don't watch the NBA all that much but I love me some 2k.

												The only way to make this game good is to make your character look absolutley ♥♥♥♥ed up.

												Let me start off by saying the reviews for this game are really unfair. Yes MyCareer has flaws but not enough to cause all these negative reviews. (I just started playing on PC, I've played console mostly) Here are the pros and cons imo.Pros1. Graphics look amazing. I have a 400$ laptop and if not for my screen resolution the game would look really nice. I have to run it on fairly low settings though.2. Gameplay out of this world.3. Presentation is just so good. Feels like a real NBA game when playing.4. So many customizable options. MyGm allows relocation and customizable stadiums with tons of options. You can even create your own shoe. The amount of options are almost over the top.5. Gamemodes are fantastic. MyCareer lets you play as an actual college team and play in the 2015 NCAA Championship against Wisconsin (and they have Kaminsky and Dekker lol)Cons1. You are basically forced to be black in MyCareer. Your Family and biological twin sister are black. And if you do choose a white character it looks kinda wierd.2. You are called Freq all the time and on game commentary. It would be nice if we could choose between a few nicknames at least. (I get that if you were called by your players name, it would be hard technologically speaking.3. 8 Games your Rookie season in MyCareer. Worst part of the entire game. Forget about impressing as a rookie. 2k forces you to sim most of the games. Pathetic thought process by 2k. 4. Your stats are terrible to start out with. During high school and college you are hyped to be the next NBA allstar. However, you enter the league as an 57 overall. Makes no sense.5. MyCareer in general. I still find it as a fun gamemode just because I like sports but I can see why people hate it. (Plus I have a low attention span to stick out through full games.In conclusion, as long as MyCareer isn't the only reason you play the game, there are still so many more options and gamemodes. My personal favorite is MyGm.			"

												Never thought this game was this good.I always wanted to play a NBA 2K.. game. But spending 50 euros is a bit much for me.So when the game was in sale. I Tried it. And since then I'm addicted to this game. And cannot stop playing it. Nice meme for putting an IGN quote in the thumbnail.Getitng in was weird. Since I was only used to play fifa where you can faceroll defend by holding one button LMAO. But here you really have to time the jumps to defend. And react fast. MyPlayer career with Spike Lee is very interesting. Feels like a movie for some reason. Playing online. Teaming up with other players picking a court etc. It's really fun. Graphically this game is very nice. People that have played 2K15 and disliked this game. I can't really give an opinion on that. Mainly because this is my first NBA 2K game. But if you like a sports game. Basketball game. I really recommend this.+++++++++ENABLE DJ KHALED PLAYLIST IF YOU ARE PLAYING THE GAME+++++++++++++			"

												This game is semi-good , semi-bad.First of all , it has improved a lot from last years. From graphics , to better gameplay and structure of the mods this game has been the best nba 2k game so far. The models look more realistic than ever , gameplay feels a lot smoother but it has some flaws (more on that later). Defense has been improved a lot. There are a lot more animations and these make the game feel like a true NBA game. The atmosphere of the matches is good. Especially in moments where the score is in a critical condition and every move determines the final outcome of the game. You can feel the crowd . It breathes energy and ""motivation "" , so to say. One thing I really liked is the fact that If the home team loses by a lot , then you start seeing the fans leave the stadium and you end up with like 1k spectators or less. A small detail , yet a great one.The commentators also do a great job both on the post-game and pre-game shows as well as in the game. Pre-game shows are very entairtaining to watch and they effectively fill the time you to wait for the game to load. In-game , commentators do a great job at transferring the atmosphere of the game to you , the player. Although some lines get repeated a lot and I would like to be monthly updates to them. Aside from these things , some things I also like is that every team has the right coach , a full-modeled character, and not a common one to all teams. In timeouts coaches talk to you and ask various things such as pressure more or shoot more , etc. . Also the soundtrack is good although it feels like it needs more tracks , a thing that may be asserted in the next game. It contains music from different genres , with Rap being the leading one. Now to modes : I will only talk about MyCarrer and MyTeam because these are the ones that I have only played. MyCareer:MyCareer is pretty solid for another year , with the exception of the Spike Lee addition. And that's where the mode starts showing some problems. For example,  you feel like you dont have a lot of freedom . It's more restricted in comparison with the previous games. Your family and friends are black (no intention of racism) and that's awkward when you made your player a white person. Maybe Spike Lee oversaw that and didn't fix it. But aside from that you basically follow a premade story and you cant do anything to change it. I found the story interesting and I liked the fact that we had the chance to play college games. Even though they were small in duration , they were pretty fun. After finishing with the Spike Lee story , MyCareer gets a lot more interesting. Endorsements are a great addition to the game and a big reason to keep you in the game for a long time. Practise manages it as well. (although not in the same degree as endorsements)MyTeam:MyTeam is the game mode that's held me the most on this game. Almost all my game-hours are spent on this mode. It's fun , interesting and you have to think sometimes on how to make the most out of your auctions and so on. I really like opening packs whenever I have the money , even though pack odds are not very good, something that definitely needs to be considered heavily in the next NBA2k. Then you have the auction house. AH plays a huge role in the mode. It's  basically the one that determine if you're gonna be rich or not. You need to think sometimes on how to handle your auctions , like when to sell them , how much , etc. Modes are good too. Domination is definitely the mode you want to start with. After you complete it ,something that's not so difficult to do, you can hop in to Road To The Playoffs mode. There you play online with other players so make sure you have a good team. Gauntlet is another online mode too. Even though they are fun modes to play , the lack of stable servers makes them really nerve-racking and make you rage a lot. And that's a serious reason why some people quit the game. A lot of times I have found myself lagging for no reason and get thrown out of the game , thus losing it . This is a problem that needs to be immediately addressed in the next game.Also 2k has to do something about people that buy mt from 3rd - party sites. It makes the AH go nuts and prices go way higher than they were supposed to be and that's causing the players to feel frustrated and quit trying to buy players.Overall , I recommend NBA 2k16 to everyone that like sports games , and just wants to have fun. MyTeam is guaranteed to keep a lot of players busy with the game. Even though a lot of problems need to be addressed in NBA 2k17 ,  2k16 still remains a pretty solid choice for NBA lovers.			"

												I would actually not recommend this game when it first came out. It was full with bugs and glitches, not to mention early release server issues, and that it is easily tampered by cheats and hackers with a simple Cheat Engine tool. But, I can't blame 2K for releasing such game on schedule that still needs alot of fixing, they gotta earn money right? I don't really have any choice but to tolerate these flaws since I really love playing NBA 2k, and with the effort they are trying to exert on fixing those bugs, I really have to give them credit.PROS: Smooth gameplay, great graphics(obviously), good cpu logic(kinda)CONS: After all patches, some minor bugs still exist; MyPark still thrived by cheats though they ban ocassionallyOverall, I recommend this game for those who really like to play basketball simulation games and those who have high tolerance to its flaws, coz, what choice do we have? nba live? meh			"

Graphics are awesome... animations as well... so is the sound.It has everything u could wish for ......EXCEPT a nice career mode !!!!U can't influence anything until ur 2nd NBA year rly... u just follow a premade story with barely any decisions to make except what high school, college or NBA team u join. And the first two don't matter at all. The story is clearly written for a black person... ur relatives are black and the way the dialogue goes u can't even pretend to be adopted as a white guy so... if ur a white dude... ur ♥♥♥♥ed. No immersion there.You can't even rly influence ur draft position... no matter how good ur stats are and how much u dominate games in college ur draft position still goes down after every game since the story wants it to...Plus all this rly has no replay value at all...Gotta decide for yourself if u can live with all that.

It has it's bugs and issues, but it is the most real to life version of NBA 2k ever.PROS-2k did a great job this year of reducing the ""cheese"" in every way (It is VERY hard to draw charges, run baseline for an easy 2, or pull up for a contested 3 and knock it down for example)-You feel like you are in complete control of your players much more than last year, mainly because you rarely are ever stuck in animations-It isn't easy to score. This might sound bad, but this makes the game so much better. As I'm sure some people remember in 2k15, RT+X to the basket or shooting a 3 with any half decent 3pt shooter gave you a free basket.-Excellent graphics, the best looking sports game I have ever seen.-Fluid and varied gameplay, overall fun to play with many different modes, difficulties, and playstyles-Much better connection to servers/lag issues than previous years-Music/overall atmosphere- pregame/postgame show with Shaq, Ernie, and Kenny is great. The music is a wide variety of genres and cultures, mainly hip-hop and rap however so if you arent into that kind of music you can turn it off-Lots of settings/options, very customizeable and in some gamemodes you can even adjust gameplay sliders (percentage of 3's going in for example)-VERY ACCURATE RATINGS. This is so important, because many cards last year had extremely over-boosted ratings, which contributed a lot to the ""cheese""CONS-Some framerate issues, especially in cutscenes, but I have a 750 ti and I'm doing fine framerate wise with some medium, some high settings-""BE THE STORY"" except all you do in mycareer is follow the exact storyline Spike Lee has laid out for you, rarely being able to ever make your own decisions-Sometimes the game can be frusturating, players missing wide open shots when it seems like you should make it or things like that-Lots of bugs unrelated to gameplay, cards having the wrong ratings (Rookie vince carter has the same ratings as the 15+years later vince carter) and other things like that, but im sure these will be fixedOverall- 9/10, I really recommend this game to anyone who remotely enjoys basketball, I don't watch the NBA all that much but I love me some 2k.

												This game isn't good, apart from the general gameplay. Story - 5/10The story is directed by Spike Lee, and it is - quite frankly - terrible. I don't think it's bad due to the 'ghetto hood rat' type of story, but it is just not good. No character development, and I don't understand where it's going. It almost feels downgraded compared to 2K15. Gameplay - 8/10The gameplay is pretty good, and is a lot more fast paced than 2K15. However, the camera is utter ♥♥♥♥ in this interation of the series, and that makes me hate it. Although, you still have basketball at it's core and that's all that matters to some people.Graphics - 9/10The graphics are pretty damn amazing. Not lifelike at all, but they feel immersive. That said, getting the game to run without any frame drops is impossible. My GPU is a 660, but I've turned everything to low and even the crowd off and I get around the same frames as I do with everything on ~high.Multiplayer - 0/10Have fun trying to get this to work. I spent 3 HOURS TRYING TO GET THIS TO WORK. But steam still has the audacity to tell me that I've played to much, even though I tried to refund it on the day I bought it. I've sent them around 10 refund requests, but to no avail. Steam obviously don't care about their customers, or they would have realised that this game is broken in a lot of places and therefore I have a vaild reason to get a refund. Don't bother buying this for co-op/multiplayer. Overall - 5/10. Don't buy it. Do yourself a favour. Waste of money and steam won't even let me refund it. I hope they realise that they are being ridiculous. If you just want to play MyCareer, make sure to grab a GTX 970/R9 390 so you have the best experience. The camera pan frame drops are stupid.			"

												If you ignore the first season aka the ""Spike Lee Joint"" Part, of this game, then you will find proabably the best Basketball Game in quite a few years. The amount of content is impressive, the graphics are great, the controls are tight and you know it's your fault if something doesn't work out and not the game's. MyCareer has probably the best fake twitter ever, which is also nice. I've spent several hours on the free weekend and utterly enjoyed it. But I think I now am at my limit for a while and will wait for another deal down the line.			"

												Never thought this game was this good.I always wanted to play a NBA 2K.. game. But spending 50 euros is a bit much for me.So when the game was in sale. I Tried it. And since then I'm addicted to this game. And cannot stop playing it. Nice meme for putting an IGN quote in the thumbnail.Getitng in was weird. Since I was only used to play fifa where you can faceroll defend by holding one button LMAO. But here you really have to time the jumps to defend. And react fast. MyPlayer career with Spike Lee is very interesting. Feels like a movie for some reason. Playing online. Teaming up with other players picking a court etc. It's really fun. Graphically this game is very nice. People that have played 2K15 and disliked this game. I can't really give an opinion on that. Mainly because this is my first NBA 2K game. But if you like a sports game. Basketball game. I really recommend this.+++++++++ENABLE DJ KHALED PLAYLIST IF YOU ARE PLAYING THE GAME+++++++++++++			"

												This game is semi-good , semi-bad.First of all , it has improved a lot from last years. From graphics , to better gameplay and structure of the mods this game has been the best nba 2k game so far. The models look more realistic than ever , gameplay feels a lot smoother but it has some flaws (more on that later). Defense has been improved a lot. There are a lot more animations and these make the game feel like a true NBA game. The atmosphere of the matches is good. Especially in moments where the score is in a critical condition and every move determines the final outcome of the game. You can feel the crowd . It breathes energy and ""motivation "" , so to say. One thing I really liked is the fact that If the home team loses by a lot , then you start seeing the fans leave the stadium and you end up with like 1k spectators or less. A small detail , yet a great one.The commentators also do a great job both on the post-game and pre-game shows as well as in the game. Pre-game shows are very entairtaining to watch and they effectively fill the time you to wait for the game to load. In-game , commentators do a great job at transferring the atmosphere of the game to you , the player. Although some lines get repeated a lot and I would like to be monthly updates to them. Aside from these things , some things I also like is that every team has the right coach , a full-modeled character, and not a common one to all teams. In timeouts coaches talk to you and ask various things such as pressure more or shoot more , etc. . Also the soundtrack is good although it feels like it needs more tracks , a thing that may be asserted in the next game. It contains music from different genres , with Rap being the leading one. Now to modes : I will only talk about MyCarrer and MyTeam because these are the ones that I have only played. MyCareer:MyCareer is pretty solid for another year , with the exception of the Spike Lee addition. And that's where the mode starts showing some problems. For example,  you feel like you dont have a lot of freedom . It's more restricted in comparison with the previous games. Your family and friends are black (no intention of racism) and that's awkward when you made your player a white person. Maybe Spike Lee oversaw that and didn't fix it. But aside from that you basically follow a premade story and you cant do anything to change it. I found the story interesting and I liked the fact that we had the chance to play college games. Even though they were small in duration , they were pretty fun. After finishing with the Spike Lee story , MyCareer gets a lot more interesting. Endorsements are a great addition to the game and a big reason to keep you in the game for a long time. Practise manages it as well. (although not in the same degree as endorsements)MyTeam:MyTeam is the game mode that's held me the most on this game. Almost all my game-hours are spent on this mode. It's fun , interesting and you have to think sometimes on how to make the most out of your auctions and so on. I really like opening packs whenever I have the money , even though pack odds are not very good, something that definitely needs to be considered heavily in the next NBA2k. Then you have the auction house. AH plays a huge role in the mode. It's  basically the one that determine if you're gonna be rich or not. You need to think sometimes on how to handle your auctions , like when to sell them , how much , etc. Modes are good too. Domination is definitely the mode you want to start with. After you complete it ,something that's not so difficult to do, you can hop in to Road To The Playoffs mode. There you play online with other players so make sure you have a good team. Gauntlet is another online mode too. Even though they are fun modes to play , the lack of stable servers makes them really nerve-racking and make you rage a lot. And that's a serious reason why some people quit the game. A lot of times I have found myself lagging for no reason and get thrown out of the game , thus losing it . This is a problem that needs to be immediately addressed in the next game.Also 2k has to do something about people that buy mt from 3rd - party sites. It makes the AH go nuts and prices go way higher than they were supposed to be and that's causing the players to feel frustrated and quit trying to buy players.Overall , I recommend NBA 2k16 to everyone that like sports games , and just wants to have fun. MyTeam is guaranteed to keep a lot of players busy with the game. Even though a lot of problems need to be addressed in NBA 2k17 ,  2k16 still remains a pretty solid choice for NBA lovers.			"

												The game breaking bugs I keep encountering are extremely frustrating and seem to be experienced by numerous people.  It's too bad that you don't really get to play much right off the bat, you'll spend most of your 2 hour return window watching cut scenes...  Right now I cannot recommend this game to anyone.1st MyCareer character won't go past the 1st press interview of the second season, which is really sad because I read that's where things get fun and interesting. You get to plan your off days, choose who to befriend and what sponsorships to take.  I was really looking forward to it.2nd MyCareer character crashes to desktop when I select a College.// Review follow up.  Loving the game now that the problem has been figured out.  All of us that were experiencing the crashing issue simply replaced our .exe with the Patch 5 version and it works!  They screwed something up in Patch 6.They still get a thumbs down from me, as they don't seem to be eager to fix it with 17 right around the corner.			"

												In the beginning of the game the story line is average. There is nothing you don't expect to happen. After your awful rookie year of literally 8 games. You go to the actual game. This is where you actually play 82 games(regular season.) This game has incredible graphics, Really cool ways to control your character. BUT IF U ARE GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME BUY A WIRERLESS CONTROLLER. JUST DO. The animations are sub-par but nobody really cares about that right? OK, so here what I wanted to tell you If you try to play myPark nobody is online ever!! Besides all of that the games just get repetitive after a while. This game just sits in my games collum waiting to be played but it probually never will be!! their is more to this game though there is character customization relistic purchases. I still have a lot of fun every time I play this game it's just that If you play it for a long time it gets a bit too repetitive. I wasted my money a bit. Like I said before average gameplay. Wait until this game drops down in prices like $20.00 or so or just wait for the next one.			"

												EDIT: i just wanna add that the reason the game is designed the way it is is so that users get frustrated and end up spending real money on in-game credits called Virtual Currency to help upgrade their in-game teams and players. today this is a very common method in the gaming industry. it facilitates the siphoning of extra money out of consumers. they prey on the young and on those with disposable income who are not too proud to pay to win. sadly, improving your players' skills with VC does not necessarily imrpove your winning record or the game's fun. sincere advice: if you are unfortunate enough to have purchased this, then whatever you do, do NOT EVER purchase VC. it would be giving in to 2k's predatory business tactics and you can earn VC by playing the game (trust me, don't play the game). as gamers, we have to come together if we want to stop these actions by boycotting microtransactions and games that seek to make microtransactions necessary to fully enjoy the game. successful microtransaction sales result in innovation-free, content-free half-games like this because developers start to think that they really don't have to put as much effort into their products in order to yield satisfactory profits.would you go to a movie thater which had coin slots at the seats and asked you to put in a dollar for better sound, and another dollar to continue watching beyond the 60 minute mark, etc?terrible game. my friend and i have been playing it for a few weeks and it is extremely dissatisfyng mostly because it uses bad AI to cheat you out of certain(most) games. it has many problems that can make you want to break your computer. for example, when the CPU possesses the ball, it can handle it anywhere and the ball will noclip through any object necessary for it to complete the scripted play and score points. yet, when the player has the ball, he will lose it any time it collides with any part of an opponent's body. the cpu has a good chance (FEELS like 60% and in certain games more like 70%) to make any shot from anywhere, but in order for you to make a shot you must have no opponent within 6 feet of you AND make a perfect/near-perfect shot release, or be very lucky. i can(could, before i uninstalled) make about 1 in 20 shots that dont meet those criteria. the cpu constantly pulls off magic johnson/rondo-style acrobatic passes from everyday point guards like trey burke. but if the player tries to make a good, normal chest or bounce pass then there is a chance your target will quickly move into the way of a defender, forcing a turnover (this is a self-proclaimed ""sim game"" PUNISHING players for making a good real-life basketball decision). on the other side of the same token, the AI is just so bad overall that your best option on offence is often to pass it straight into a bigman in the middle of the paint despite traffic. the CPU defence can anticipate every dribble move and lead pass you make, but chuck it into the key where all the defenders are and you'll probably get an assist. you have very little control over your successes/failures especially in the higher difficulties. mycareer is unplayable because any team mate of yours that is controlled by the cpu suddenly has a very low IQ, will run out of bounds, leave assignments(very prominent and game-breaking), take stupid shots or refuse to take/fail to make great shots, however the opposing AI is usually psychic and is able to react to your actions immediately (it simply reads the button inputs, it feels like when you control your player you are controlling the opposition at the same time). yeah the game doesnt look that bad, but thats where the praises stop; theres a bunch of gimmicky BS in the game like a shoe creator, a bunch of corporate endorsement-inspired activities, (by the way 2k youre not fooling anyone, this adds nothing to the game gameplay-wise so its a cheap, blatant wat to start stuffing advertisements into our  games, like seriously how much more money does 2k need) and that stupid new mycareer thing they call a ""movie"" which basically only forces you to watch/skip through annoying cutscenes and to be this stupid personality, giving you minimal life choices, completely destroying the immersion aspect of mycareer mode(the only thing that made it more fun than a reguar exhibition match) and is an eyesore of a stain on spike lee's legacy. the voice acting is awful, cutscenes look like an xbox/ps2 gen game(i thought cutscenes were supposed to look better than the gameplay, wtf??), and the script overall is just meaningless and painfully cliche.its really clear that 2k is just trying to sell $60+++ updated rosters every year and the quality of their releases doesnt mean much to them as long as theyre raking in the bucks. year after year 2k has failed to produce an impressive simulation game. 2k10 had me intrigued with its innovative myplayer mode at the time, but 6 years later this is a monumental disappointment. seriously, in terms of realism and AI this is on par with previous 2ks and the maddens of the early 2000s, only more frustrating because even if you anticipate every action of the cpu it doesnt matter because, if it has to, the game will basically make your player move like each of his feet are submerged in 3 gallons of wet cement. (yes thats another thing i forgot to add, if you manage to outsmart the cpu it'll just heavily slow you down and delay your control inputs)i could rant about this maddeningly pathetic excuse for a sim game forever but ill just stop here by saying i really regret this purchase, but i am relieved that  got it during the summerr sale for only $12.

												I don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. Yes, My Career sucks. There's several other games modes for you to enjoy outside of the ""story mode"". The game play is absolutely amazing. The graphics are amazing. The commentary is really in depth. The soundtrack is amazing. Everything about this game is amazing. All the aspects of the actual game play are stellar and make you feel like you're not just playing a basketball game you're watching a basketball game. Does that make sense?Great game.			"

												 First off I would like to say that this game is extremely racist. The game also encourages you to spend another $60-$100 or more to upgrade your player from a 55 overall. Now the biggest problem with this game is the crashes... The game just recently started crashing after every other MyCareer game, and the hundreds of people on Steam forums can attest to this. Suprise, no comment or response from 2k.... They just copy/paste some generic troubleshooting response blaming Windows or your graphics card. I believe the ""crashes"" are a marketing scheme from this money grubbing company to get us to buy 2k17. Think about it, they put the game on sale for $12.99 for the Steam Summer Sale then about a month later these ""crashes"" started up after a recent patch. Now also consider that 2k17 comes out in 2 months. Coincidence? Don't think so... DO NOT BUY!			"

												I'm a huge basketball fan which makes me invest 60 dollars a year (usually) in the new addition of basketball games as little changes usually make a big deal. This year's addition was definitely an improvement in gameplay yet the PC port was ♥♥♥♥ poor and little effort or comittment was made for the PC. It's inferior in a lot of ways that the consoles don't experience. I get that it's harder to optimize for multiple systems but my expectations are heightened when I pay 60 dollars for a game. The same price that someone on console pays, I expect the same quality and you don't get that here. I can't even play the game anymore and I refuse to support them on PC as of now. I'm honestly done with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The only way I'd pay for it was if they knocked the price down upon RELEASE. Either that or take the route WWE went and release the game at a later date than on console for a more polished release. As it stands, I do not recommend this game to anyone on PC...			"

												I was thinking whether to give the game a positive or a negative vote.  I've played a lot of basketball simulations and in this case, NBA 2k16 is certainly one of the, if not THE best game ever to be released. Why the hesitation, then, u might ask. Well, 3 months have passed since the release of the game and it's the first time when it's fully playable (in my terms).  What's happenned? Looks like 2K Sports decided to give us an incomplete product and made us pay for the beta-testing of it. I'm pretty mad about this fact, and I'm not sure if I wanna' do it again. Probably not. Not to be baseless, I'll give you some examples of my negative experience with the game:-invisible players, not allowing me to do almost anything against them since their actions are unpredictable(on- and offline)-fps drops-sound stopping in the middle of the game, not returning at all, or after a few quarters-lots of connection problems with the servers-black, instead of colourful floors of the arenas, 3pt line not visible-gameplay things like still being defended hardly after passing the rival in animation.And I haven't even played the MyCareer and other modes than Exhibition, as I'm not that much interested in them, so I've got no clue how many errors are awaiting me in there. After all, the gameplay is really, really nice (but that's what we got used to when playing 2k sport games). Nonetheless, this is the first time when those errors have occurred, and I suppose I can't give the game a positive vote. Maybe next year. Maybe...			"

												Please note in advance that I've spent a lot of time also playing a console version.Do I recommend this game? Sure, with a few asterisks involved.PROS:Great actual basketball play.Variety of offline modes.Runs smooth on my admittedly average computer.CONS: MyCareer. No, not the ""racial"" issue. The fact that it was sold as YOUR story when it is anything but. It's entirely Spike Lee's story. And honestly, I wouldn't mind that so much if, after, you're asked how YOU would have done things. For example, there's only a handful of colleges recruiting you. As good as you allegedly are, you should have every major basketball school in the nation coming after you. Notably absent (I am a touch biased in this regard) are ACC powerhouses UNC and Duke. What if I want to pull a Steph Curry and go to a relative unknown like Davidson? Nope, you take what you can get. Furthering issues is that your rookie year is shortened to 8 games, most of which are just placeholders for filler intros about playing against LBJ, returning home to Brooklyn, etc. On draft day, unless you've played other modes and/or bought VC, you'll enter the NBA as a whopping 55 overall. That isn't potential legend territory, that's roster filler territory. VC. Expect to grind for it or buy it if you actually want a useful MyCareer player.Remaining issues with the actual basketball play. From time to time, centers who have no real life skills beyond post play will nail wide open jump shots from beyond the 3 point line, while you'll attempt a driving layup against a smaller defender and...miss. If you like basketball, and can pick this up on sale, go for it. Otherwise, the better option is to wait for next year's. "

												You know what I’m not even gonna be nice to this game. The story line makes no sense, the characters are dull and annoying, people keep calling your character Freq which makes you feel like you’re not playing as yourself but some dumb ♥♥♥♥ guy with a dumb ♥♥♥♥ nickname. Your whole rookie season is practically wasted, Vic and his crazy idiocy just makes me want to punch my monitor. Your character’s sister is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, she wants to control everything, she even called Freq’s girlfriend a GOLD DIGGER when she herself is making money off her brother. Speaking of Freq’s family, they are all ♥♥♥♥ing black and so if your character is white you’ll have a ♥♥♥♥ing twin sister who’s black, what were they thinking? When you go from college to pro you’re agent kept talking like you had a choice to stay in college if you want to. The cut scene ends with Freq saying I’ll think about it but next, BAM you’re in the ♥♥♥♥ing NBA draft. This year’s draft was horrible they just went through it with pictures of the drafted players. Then everybody around you keep talking about how Vic is a bad influence but they don’t give us a choice to continue to be friends with Vic, they ♥♥♥♥ing killed him off for Christ sake, what’s the point of those cut scenes then? There was one scene where Freq had a long talk with Vic in the car and NOTHING ♥♥♥♥ing happened! They talked a lot of ♥♥♥♥ which ended so awkwardly and makes you feel like what the ♥♥♥♥ have I just watched for 10 minutes??? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? Everything about this story sucks! Most importantly how are some people ok with that ♥♥♥♥ing Frequency Vibration ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? I thought this is supposed to me MyCareer, all we got was a ♥♥♥♥ing Freq Career or some horse ♥♥♥♥. I had absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing say for my character. I’ll be honest this is the WORST MyCareer I have ever seen! To sum up, the entire story was nothing but lama ♥♥♥♥ talk, the characters were boring and ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, the cut scenes were so long and pointless, the ending was that your ♥♥♥♥ing friend died from a car crash. What is Spike Lee trying to say? 	Aside from the story, the gameplay in MyCAREER sucks as well, you start off as pretty good player in high school, then in college you might start experiencing some difficulties to play as good, then in the NBA you’re a complete ♥♥♥♥-tard who has a 55 overall rating. I had to redo the game, buy a lot of VC and boost up my player to about an 80 overall. I play as a 6’8 small forward and holy ♥♥♥♥ I can only max out my speed to a 70. Like really bruh 70, Kevin Durant’s way taller than 6’8 and he don’t run that slow. ♥♥♥♥ing 70 man how am I suppose to chase down a fast break or something. One ♥♥♥♥ing thing, I had this 80 rating before my first high school game. And in high school and college I was fast, but after I got into the NBA I suddenly became slow as ♥♥♥♥, what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the people who made this game. How can a player suddenly decrease so much speed when they transit to pro, where’s the logic. And ♥♥♥♥ if you’re teammate is wearing then number you want to wear you can’t ♥♥♥♥ing wear it like previous installments. 	2K, I have never been so let down and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playing your game. I am writing this review because I’ve been playing since 2K7 and I really have NEVER EVER EVER been so disappointed. I genuinely love NBA 2K but seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ happened this year, you guys completely took the hype and ♥♥♥♥ on our faces. This is the worst MyCareer I’ve ever seen you guys don’t even let us choose our body types anymore.			"

												Just like every other 2K they make strides in some areas and then make dumb decisions in other areas. They felt the need to redo the passing and changed the input for the controller and made most of the buttons passes. After a couple hrs you get used to this one. The one that most people hate is the pick and rolls in this game. Man did they mess up. 80% of the time of getting a teammate to set a pick messes up. Half the time the ballhander will get free but fumble and pick up his dribble. The other half of the time the player coming to set the screen completely misses the defender and then just blocks the driving lane. The amount of changes that made the game better are completely overshadowed by the mistakes they made. It still is fun like every year, but i have almost broke my controller a dozen times by wanting to throw it against a wall after stuff happens in the game. Lastly the thing that i hate the most at the moment is how broken the paint play is at the moment. The amount of time your front court lets passes get past them for an easy layup is ridiculous. I give up more than half my points because of this even though i tell them to protect the paint and make them sit down in the post. Verdict: only buy if it is under $20 otherwise you will hate yourself for paying full price for this.			"

For a new game there is just too many bugs to pay $30-$60 (it's one of the few games that gave me a blue screen).I think it crashes more than a modded Skyrim.			"

The story is mundane at best, it's meant to be gripping and draw you in, personally found it boring and more of an inconvience since I could of been playing a match(Thankfully you can skip them).Not much of a graphically update from 2K15 slighty better but not by much, gameplay is pretty much the same from 2K15 not many major tweaks but now you can miss wide open lay ups (hurray), Myteam is literally a carbon copy from... you guessed it 2K15 (seeing a pattern yet?) Mypark is Mypark you have to have a certain build and badges and stats to do anything, oh yea and if you're a rookie no one will play on your team (in some cases no one gets on till the rookie, gets off) extremely grindy for badges the game really doesn't like new player's since the higher rank you are the more benefits you get on court like higher steal rate, shooting and such, no one for new player's to really enjoy MyparkOverall I believe this game to be hardly worth the £40 or £60 price tag but if you really want it get it when it's on sale.

Gameplay isn't as good as it used to be tbh and the story in mycarrer... <sigh> pacing is off, it's slow, it's boring, it feel much more ""one lane traffic"" than other years, very non-dynamic. Spike Lee should stick to movies, he doesn't understand games.			"

												Graphics 10/10Sound 10/10Thats about it, if you actually want to play a game, this is not it.  This game is worse than most basketball games i played back in the early 2000's.  They players move like a giant cube with an animation stuck into it.  Its like the first time someone tries to use a game make for the first time and makes a circle collide with a square.  In this game you cannot make your player walk next to another, its just not possible, you will be stuck against an invisible object.But all that is dwarfed by the impressively large input lag.  I'm not talking about the time it takes for the instruction to go from my controller and be recognised by the game, nope, i'm talking about the animation almost a second long that must happen before your character actually does seomthing.you want to shoot, wait a second.you want to move forward, wait a second.you want to steal the ball, wait a few seconds.you want to change direction, wait a secondetc, you get the point.Its annoyingly hard to get your character to stand near the 3 point line because you can't slightly move, you either run, walk, or stand still.. no variable movement at all, its just isn't in the game.There are camera issues and glitches that i could not be bothered explaining.Also, there are far too many unskippable cutscenes, for series that used to excel at being a wonderful couch potatoe game where you sit infront of your tv and play with your friends, the annoying amount of unskippable scenes and transition scenes take away from the game.Oh, and the my career cutscenes.. .. ..  they suffer from poor writing.  Its like watching an interview with donald trump about americas neuclear triad.  I should give 2k props for trying to imitate the culture of harlem, but when a white surburtan office worker in australia thinks a heap of crap, imagine how the people who actually live there think about it.  I'd imagine they would be quite insulted.This game is an unsult to the past titles which i absolutle loved with over 140 hours played on nba 14 alone, with 13 being the best.If the older titles were released into todays market, they would have done far better.

												As someone who has owned NBA 2k's since 2k12 (was originally a console peasent) I believe this is one of the worst ones I have purchased. Not because of the graphics, because 99% of the time, those are spot on, but because the biggest portion of the game for me is MyPlayer. Spike Lee royally ♥♥♥♥ed it up. The addition of highschool and college ball is awesome, however, whether you are white, black, indian or asian you will have black parents, and a black twin sister. You also, only play 3 HS games, 4 College games and you only play 8 games in your rookie season. This is a very brutal part of myplayer compared to installments before.The game plays relatively well however being locked to 60fps. Graphics and general playability is about the same from past games.If you only play NBA 2k for myplayer, you may be dissappointed like me. If you play other gamemodes, it is probably a solid pickup.7/10 general game1/10 myplayer.			"

												I hate how you have a ""set"" story line and it makes you an African American. Some people want to be a great white basketball player and go against racial stereotypes, or be the next Yao Ming or Jermey Lin and be asian but in this story mode you arent really allowed to be because of your African American parents, your African American TWIN sister (no claiming you're adopted) and your African American best friend. You're pretty much restricted to following stereotypes and being a black NBA player which is a little racist itself. And the career mode is very buggy and my game crashes multiple times, it doesnt even allow me to pick my college to go to because it always crashes when I try to pick one. Also, that handshake thing you do with your sister is so cringey it gave me cancer.			"

												I was hopping that the game would be better than this. As others have said the story mode is stupid, and not only is the story extremely generic, it is target toward a specific character, even though you get to choose what your character looks like, is. The idea was intersting but poorly executed. The game just feels broken half the time, players don't behave properly, random fouls and calls, which make the career mode even worse when you are ""graded"" on these glitches. It becomes painfully clear that you are not going to make your career player good through gameplay alone, after 9 hours, i could barelly upgrade a handfull of attributes, but luckly you can BUY the points to do so, YAY!...I think the most telling point, is throught most of my playtime, the thing I capped asking my self was ""Who thought this was a good idea?""

Player models are upgraded with new, more detailed body scans, and that has a profound effect on the overall experience.You can relocate and completely rebrand your team with a mind-boggling amount of options.Even if a heated conversation was all about a choice I needed to make, I was never allowed to make it myself.For the first time in several years, I’ve only experienced a few online hiccups.Defense wins championships, and the improvements to AI defenses in NBA 2K16 bring this year’s iteration of the long-running basketball sim another title. Due to some big AI upgrades, the offensive tactics that I had been accustomed to using simply no longer work, so I was forced to think like a coach and constantly adapt. Running pick and rolls and calling plays finally felt like it was necessary, as opposed to a tougher option I had to enforce on myself. NBA 2K16 is a great representation of the sport of basketball, and it plays like a dream – both online and off.Upping Its GameThe big reason to show up this year, though, is that NBA 2K’s gameplay has been completely upgraded in nearly every way, resulting in a more true-to-life simulation experience. In previous years, I always found it easy to score by cheezing my way past AI defenders, running in circles and forcing them to make unrealistic mistakes. All of that is gone this year. Zig-zagging will result in steals and frustration, and attempts to drive the baseline will end up in terrible or blocked shots. The only reliable way to score is to use real basketball concepts, so if you’re a student of the sport you'll find yourself being rewarded for your knowledge.You have to improvise, because opposing AI coaches will start to learn your tendencies and try new ways to stop you. For example, defenders had been going underneath screens, allowing me to step back and take open jumpers; after a few successful attempts they started going around screens, forcing me to drive the lane instead. This constant game of cat and mouse kept me on my toes, searching for new ways to make plays.Whose Career Is It, Anyway?There are a staggering amount of ways you can play NBA 2K16. All the game modes I expect of the series make their triumphant return, some with interesting new wrinkles. The new Play Now Online mode makes head-to-head matches matter a bit more, since it features a promotion and relegation system. MyGM and MyLeague modes are now both fully featured management sims, allowing you to go so far as to relocate and completely rebrand your team with a mind-boggling amount of options. That same team editor can also be used in MyTeam, the card-collecting game, which has new challenges and ways to earn virtual currency.Racking Up WsLivin’ Da Dream reaches its conclusion after your rookie season, which only has eight playable games. After that, it opens up and plays more like the mode I was expecting, with 82-game seasons and new and exciting ways to improve your player on off days. That’s why I can enthusiastically recommend NBA 2K16 even with MyCareer’s failure to properly contextualize my player’s rise to stardom: at the end of the day, it’s all window dressing for the gameplay underneath – and in this case, that gameplay is spectacular.ConcludeNBA 2K16 is one of the most complete packages I’ve ever seen. Developer Visual Concepts continues to raise the sports simulation bar by completely retooling its silky-smooth gameplay, adding brand-new physics systems, and refining its traditional game modes. Not all of the changes work as well as others, most notably the Spike Lee-themed MyCareer mode, but it doesn’t take away from the impressive overall package.			"

												Updated Review:I should have changed to thumbs up for awhile because the updates fixed a lot of the original issues.  I liked this game for about 2 monthes until 2K decided to step in and mess stuff up again.  The MyCareer gameplay seems really awkward with people speeding up and slowing down the game at odd times in order to try and keep the game difficult.  Things like balls magically floating through my player when I jump a lane to steal.  It seems like the game restricts you from being unstoppable, throwing in weird glitches which I have taken pictures to prove.  Players on your team will start moving one way, glitch and move towards his defender, causing turnovers that leave me like, ""what just happen?"".  This gets quite annoying but as you can see, I am still a pretty avid user of this game.  It is addictive but honestly I just turn it off in the middle of the game when those weird momentum changes seem to be forced into the gameplay, forcing odd-looking turnovers, taller cpu teammates getting blocked and characters seemingly molding together, the player missing steals, cpu teammates missing wide open lay-ups.  The list goes on; and it only seems to have gotten worse lately with these updates.Also, with the new updates I have noticed random crashing.  Once in the playoff's, I have crashed at the end of a game and then had to restart from the beginning when I reloaded myCareer.  I also tried to use the ""Save and Quit"" option in the menu; only for the game to crash, forcing the game to open a file from a previous save.  If it crashes and no previous save, quess what?  You're restarting the game.  I just recently lost an entire 3rd Quarter from this crash and it is not the first time.  The crashes seem to have become more frequent as the game has grown older; which is rather odd. Original Review:I seriously think 2K Sports are tipping off companies to boost sales and hype up this game.  I don't even know why I paid money for this game.  Mycareer is broken; missing wide open shots all the time with an 85 overall jump shot rating.  Not to mention missing uncontested lay-ups half the the time with 80+ overall rating for inside shooting; those are always great.  I respect Spike Lee but the story is completely wack and nobody cares about behind-the-scene stuff about how you produced this POS game.  Not to mention you can't skip cut scenes in between quarters, forcing you to watch pre-game and post-game videos which takes A LONG TIME TO DO ANYTHING.  After 2K's huge update, my replays stopped working, only showing scenes of the follow-up reactions after the play where your character is talking or whatever.  Who wants to watch that, seriously?  Vsync causes a lot of visual tearing and was the only fix I could come up with for the replay problems.  So now my replays work, but the crowd stutters and everything looks choppy and poorly animated.  I played this game and gave it plenty of times and opportunities to impress me but it's terrible.  Mycareer would be awesome if the gameplay wasn't completely messed up; the calender system and customization aspects are much better than last year.  Yet, I haven't even tried any other aspect of the game besides mycareer because this game frustrated me to the point of no return.  Like I said it's a waste of money.  All the missed shots, choppy framerate, and bugs are a constant reminder. 3570k @ 4.1 GhzAsus GTX960X-Box One Controller			"

												Has some legitimate improvements over 2k15. Would recommend based on my initial reactions.MyGM/Franchise has re-introduced 3-way trades and made some minor changes to add to the realism (promises to the GM now have consequences, trades destroy chemistry, staff contracts are negotiated, etc.). Gameplay feels tighter than in the past. Shooting is far more difficult, but that seems fair. The timing of button presses and appropriate spacing is now an aquired skill rather than automatic. Players respond better to inputs and the sense of control seems more legit.Ernie and Shaq are back, but now Kenny joins them on the desk. Add in Barkley next year, and it'll be worth it just for the pre-game/haltime/post-game shows.MyCareer is actually a lot of fun. There's a lot more interaction than in 2k15 in terms of what to do on off-days and how to earn Virtual Currency (VC). The ""Spike Lee Joint"" is completely unnecessary, but starting in year 2 the game takes a huge leap foward and it becomes a real improvement over last year's encarnation of the mode. I'd recommend skipping every cutscene and just flying through year 1 ASAP. If you want to see the movie later, it's made available in your second year. It's not awful if you're a fan of Spike Lee, it's just way too much if you want to actually play a game. The entire cutscene film is nearly 2 full hours in length. That's ridiculous for a sports game.All in all, a legitimate improvement over 2k15. I've heard online play is a mess, but I stick to single player. If you're like me in that respect, give this a try.			"

												Graphics 10/10Sound 10/10Thats about it, if you actually want to play a game, this is not it.  This game is worse than most basketball games i played back in the early 2000's.  They players move like a giant cube with an animation stuck into it.  Its like the first time someone tries to use a game make for the first time and makes a circle collide with a square.  In this game you cannot make your player walk next to another, its just not possible, you will be stuck against an invisible object.But all that is dwarfed by the impressively large input lag.  I'm not talking about the time it takes for the instruction to go from my controller and be recognised by the game, nope, i'm talking about the animation almost a second long that must happen before your character actually does seomthing.you want to shoot, wait a second.you want to move forward, wait a second.you want to steal the ball, wait a few seconds.you want to change direction, wait a secondetc, you get the point.Its annoyingly hard to get your character to stand near the 3 point line because you can't slightly move, you either run, walk, or stand still.. no variable movement at all, its just isn't in the game.There are camera issues and glitches that i could not be bothered explaining.Also, there are far too many unskippable cutscenes, for series that used to excel at being a wonderful couch potatoe game where you sit infront of your tv and play with your friends, the annoying amount of unskippable scenes and transition scenes take away from the game.Oh, and the my career cutscenes.. .. ..  they suffer from poor writing.  Its like watching an interview with donald trump about americas neuclear triad.  I should give 2k props for trying to imitate the culture of harlem, but when a white surburtan office worker in australia thinks a heap of crap, imagine how the people who actually live there think about it.  I'd imagine they would be quite insulted.This game is an unsult to the past titles which i absolutle loved with over 140 hours played on nba 14 alone, with 13 being the best.If the older titles were released into todays market, they would have done far better.

												I was hopping that the game would be better than this. As others have said the story mode is stupid, and not only is the story extremely generic, it is target toward a specific character, even though you get to choose what your character looks like, is. The idea was intersting but poorly executed. The game just feels broken half the time, players don't behave properly, random fouls and calls, which make the career mode even worse when you are ""graded"" on these glitches. It becomes painfully clear that you are not going to make your career player good through gameplay alone, after 9 hours, i could barelly upgrade a handfull of attributes, but luckly you can BUY the points to do so, YAY!...I think the most telling point, is throught most of my playtime, the thing I capped asking my self was ""Who thought this was a good idea?""

												You know this game is not at all what I expected, I think the only reason that I plajy it is to live the real-time roster that is currently available.  But the MyCareer is trash complete and utter garbage.  Spike Lee accomplished nothing in this and should never be brought on to operate anything in NBA 2K again.  They need to stick to the NBA 2k14 and 15 template for my My Career.  Please fire Spike Lee or get a better developement team for that mode.  I have more hours played on 2k15 than I do 2k16 and I think I am finally going to call it quits on 2k16 and go back to the 15.			"

												My experience in basketball games ranges from the NBA Street games (you know, the best ones) to 2K15, and now 2K16. There have been stellar reviews for 2K16, praising it for the most quality basketball game thus far. Well I have to say, all in all in comparison to its previous installment, I'm not impressed.Yes, 2K16 has an actual story to its game (a Spike Lee Joint apparently), but the story is streamlined in various ways. This is not necessarily a good thing. Regardless of your nationality or ethnicity you get the same family, the same hometown, and the same story. It feels lazy and borderline offensive even. Kind of feels as though 2K Games thinks only black people are playing basketball, which is just kind of stupid. Not to mention that the story takes too much out of your hands. Want to pursue your education first and hone your skill with your college basketball team? Too bad! Spike Lee says you're off to the NBA! Unprepared I might add, because you simply aren't of the appropriate skill to handle these kinds of games yet. Almost like you should have stayed and honed that skill first. Oh well, too bad that option wasn't available eh? Kind of makes the time you took deciding on which college to go to pointless.Aside from some random cut scenes with the cringeworthy cast of characters (Jesus your in-game girlfriend [another decision you weren't allowed to make by the way] is downright nightmarish), the game basically falls back into the same game NBA2K15 was, with minor tweaks.That's the best way to explain the game as a whole, minor tweaks. Nothing special, but I suppose if you missed out on 2K15, then this game will be a newer experience to you. It's not a bad game, just not good enough to warrant calling it a brand new game.			"

												Game is very choppy and laggy. Frame rate issues cause for very frustrating gameplay. Just doesnt seem meant for pc i can run ARK: Survival Evolved on High with less lag than a game of 2k with medium settings and no crowd. I'd request a refund for the game but i put well over 2 hours into just trying to get the game playable by adjusting with the video settings, testing out the game play for a min or two than going back to re adjust.  I put so much time into trying to get this game to work because i actually really enjoy the nba 2k games and have purchased every one since 2k5. Then there are just the issues of getting the pre-order through steam i did not recieve any bonuses even though i bought the Michael Jordan edition and that seems to be a problem that occurs only through steam. Those that bought a physical copy or through amazon have all recieved their pre-order bonuses. I figured id get this game on on my laptop because of  better graphics and frame rates but it doesn't even look or perform as well as 2k14 for my xbox 360. With 12gb of ram and AMD 8700 processor and an AMD radeon r6 8700 graphics card you'd think that wouldnt be the case. If steam and 2k can fix the gameplay issues and the pre-order bonuses missing than game is good but as it stands right now the game is almost unplayable and extremely frustrating and absolutley not worth $99.99, should of just got it for my xbox one id actually be able to shoot the ball without lagging into a travelling violation every so often			"

												A really fun game to play with friends or solo. However, this is probably the 3rd or 4th year in a row that 2k has had release issues with the VC purchases not working at all as well as the pre-order extra VC not being added. The graphics are amazing on the PC and the modes are fun. BUT, it is sad to see 2k fall short and not be 100% ready on launch day. We pre-ordered for a reason and paid for services that have not yet been provided by the mfg... some might call that fraud. I am hoping that 2k will resolve this issue quickly, if not it might be time to go back to NBA live or stock to playing a college title. My recommend is yes/no. Just like last year it took them a while to fix most of the issues, right now I would hold off on the game, but if you love basketball I would check the reviews and 2k website in about a month to see if all has been fixed and then get the game.

												Okay.. I already played NBA 2K since 2K9 for the first time ever I disappointed with 2K SportDon't get me wrong, there's some improvement this year. And this is a review based on the pre release date. Pros :+ The gameplay animation and physics is good. I like it, feels more real now.+ More animation for players. More varieties of movements.+ Dunk feels more powerful+ Good concept idea on MyCareer (From High School to NBA Draft)+ AI is harder than last year. AI's Defense is more intense and quite hard to breakCons :- Always crashing after half game of the 1st NBA Game of MyCareer. Now I can't continue MyCareer- Quite lagging compare to NBA2K15 with the same game spec- MyCareer storyline. You just played as Freq, it doesn't matter what's your name is, you always become Freq. What I enjoy about MyCareer from all the other 2K is I can be myself. Now it doesn't matter, it's Frequency Vibrations who will become the all star. And yes. that's your nickname Frequency Vibrations.- Some bug where suddenly pass icon just appeared out of nowhere, very annoying especially when I tried to shot and that pass icon suddenly appeared and I end up of passing.- Stuttering especially on commentator's talk. So lag and they are late to comments any action in courtOf course I will recommended this game if 2K Games is already optimized this game, waiting for some patch and a new GPU driver that support this game. Let's see until the release date, if there's some optimizations and get better, this game is 100% recommended. it's funBut for this pre release review it's a naaahhSorry 2K..

												Firstly, just look at my hours for this game and the previous 4 iterations. Obviously, I'm a fan of the NBA 2K series. HOWEVER...One of the more recent updates they did broke MyCareer for a lot of people. When you try to save and quit, you crash to desktop with no error 50% of the time. If you finish a game and try to advance to the next loading screen, it crashes 50% of the time. I've even heard of people crashing while just trying to simulate through games. Imagine the frustration of playing a masterful game, netting a triple-double, and then having that progress erased with no chance to save it. I paid full price for this game when it first came out, and have since then probably bought $50 in VC, but now my characters are all unplayable. If I could, I'd get my money back for the game and the VC I bought.In short, do not buy this game. EA broke it, and they have no intention of fixing it because they'd rather you just buy 2K17. I don't know why I would expect anything else from a publisher with as much garbage history as EA.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP, PLEASE KEEP YOUR MONEY FOR FALLOUT 4 OF SOMETHING. JUST INSTALL A ROSTER UPDATE TO AN OLDER VERSION.UPDATE: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP.""The most impressive supports game ever assembled"" my ♥♥♥. Although if someone paid me that much money I'd probably say that even right now.DON'T BUY IT.Ok now, I've played my career enough to hate this gameThe rules state and I quote ""Contact initiated by the defensive player guarding a player with the ball is not legal.This contact includes, but is not limited to, forearm, hands, or body check"". So If a defender charges to me and im not moving, that should not be a foul.Except it always is, always. Especially in the layup attempts. I don't seem to get such fouls.My teammates have a basketball IQ of 25. Say Someone got their shot blocked and it went out of bounds in my halfcourt. The guy inbounds immediately, giving me the only chance of a hail mary.Also they miss wide open layups, their body movement while finishing a play always say ""BLOCK MY ♥♥♥"". Did i say I always miss wide open shots while my shot meter is very close to centre? (sometimes green releases too)Gotta mention, you cannot skip in-game cutscenes (such as timeouts, free throw prep stuff, the black and white matchup animation etc.)You cannot sim to offdays is another annoying thingI am in Miami right now and in the game i just finished, Luol Deng inbounded into the backboard twice.I will still play this game from time to time but my last message is this.♥♥♥♥ YOU 2K FOR WASTING HOURS OF MY LIFEUpdate: On a scale from Einstein to the devs, I think teammate IQ is much more resembling to the devs. If I want my SG to carry it while playing a PG, what he does is pass it back to me immediately. This means backcourt violation.Update 2: I definitely think Developers' IQ is lower than their shoe numbers.			"

												Jacko Rating9/10Well another year and another NBA2K - This review assumes you are familiar with the series.This year the team has given us something a little different and have included a story driven My Career mode, while some will hate it I thought it gave some fresh blood to the franchise and it can be mostly skipped anyway for those who aren't interested.  The game itself has been improved in several areas but to sum up it has become more realistic with the AI playing better and not so many easy dunks or silly looking alley oops in My Park for example.Graphics and Audio are both top notch and the commentary is an absolute treat with a surprising amount of variation, gameplay has become in my view slightly harder which I luv and My Park has had a few tweaks for the better also, mainly toning  down the massive advantage that taller players had previously and dampened down the 3 point shot success rate in Sunset Park which was very annoying previously and turned the games into rubbish ball for 5 year olds rather than resembeling the real game.Amazingly the game worked right out of the box - unlike the last 3 years releases which were full of bugs and issues that prevented many gamers from playing the game they bought for several days.  All in all NBA2K is still miles in front of any other BBall sim out there today and this year's release in my view has improved the franchise, given My Park a much needed face lift and brought back the highschool and university ranks to play through in My Career.A big Thumbs Up on this one :)			"

												I've never left a bad review for a game before.  I've always felt like if a bunch of developers spent a huge amount of time on a crappy game then it'd be messed up to leave a bad review.  Well in this case I figure it's ok.  Because they take a pretty good game and absolutely ruined it.  For insance.  This game has a shot based around a cage taht fills and a timed release.  Well you'd think they'd make sure that guage is always visible.  WELL THEY DON'T.  Occasionally the guage will go off screen, behind other players or behind annoying popups that tell you things like who the announcer is that's talking or how big the last run was.  It's so infuriating to go to take a shot and suddenly have the guage covered.  It's even more annoying because the guage fill time seems to vary based on which player is shooting and how far they are from the goal.  And sometimes it doesn't even fill up.  It just shoots.  And there's no real good tutorial in the game.  Like you're just suppose to already know how to play.  So then you get to the passing on offence.  You tell it to pass and maybe it'll pass somewhere good, maybe it won't.  WHO KNOWS.  Then on defence you switch players by pressing A.  So press A repeatedly until you get the player you want.  But it transfewrs you to the player closest to the ball.  Not the player who should be covering the shooter.  And there's no alternate button as far as I can tell to choose.  So when you're cycling players sometimes you periodically interupt another player running to position, disrupting him, then you get the player you want, but the person that other guy was suppose to be covering is wide open.  This kills the game.So... given all of that, how do you make it worse?  Well, let's throw in a crap load of ads!  For instance, every time you try to shoot a free throw, on the second shot, the gatorade logo will always block you from seeing the guage.  This kills the game.What else?  Well the game calls timeouts every friggen 2 minutes.  This is an unskippable 20 second loading screen essentially every 2 minutes.  There is no way to turn this off in options or alter the volume of timeouts that are called.  This more than anything... kills. the. game.Now if this was a crappy game, I wouldn't care.  I wouldn't even want to play it.  But this game is actually fun when you can actually play it to spite the crappy passing and defense controls.  It just needs a good tutorial, a fixed position for the shooting guage that's always on top, and the ability to turn off timeouts.  If I could do that, I'd probably play the crap out of this game and LOVE it.  But... unfortunately I want to play this game all the time and it does nothing but infuriate me because it's so close to being good and just seems to be intentionally destroyed by ads, and timeouts.  Also as a side note... the story line is garbage.  It says it's a Spike Lee joint, but if I was Spike Lee I wouldn't want my name on some garbage like that.  It's horrible.  I haven't tried online play yet.  So maybe that'll be what saves the game.  But I know better than to play a game online before practicing offline for a long time.  I guess we'll see.			"

												Id love nothing more than to recommend this game to you guys but even after the patches and updates this game is nowhere close to being worth the 60 dollar price tag. First off I know what your thinking"" the my player mode cant be all that bad"" trust me it is, its honestly as if your playing as a character that you made but that's going through someone else's stereotypical life, and to be honest I hate the guy I made if found myself rooting against him most of the time. Not to mention your first season is literally 75 percent cut scenes that are terrible and predictable and if you skip any of the them you will be lost as hell as to what's going on. But seeing how awful the plot is I guess that could be a good thing. 2k16 does improve on the terrible AI of the past making help defense run a little smoother, not to mention ally oops and dunks aren't unstoppable anymore, improvements like these make exhibition matches pretty fun to play. The different online modes are fun to play.... that is if you can find anyone to play with in the first place, as finding a match can prove to be quite difficult it often seems like the only people on are me and ""cool daddy421"". Overall there have been some improvements but not enough to justify paying 60 dollars for it, don't buy it for more than 25 dollars or just go back to playing 2k15 you aren't missing out on much here.

												Cons:Exact same gameplay as ten years ago. What exactly has changed. Oh yeah...Spike Lee's race baiting MyPlayer garbo. Yikes. Moving on...Why does the commentary just disappear in the 2nd and 4th qtrs...Shooting is a dumpster fire in terms of the actual game mechanic...Nice predictable scripting for the AI tho...Don't use Supersampling beyond '1' or your Icons will disappear over player's heads. I could go on and on about bugs...Unoptimized beyond belief...Game makes me want to kill myself. Oh well, at least there's still FIFA. How does 2K even exist still, I don't even.Pros:Ernie & ShaqPS - Transitions in this game are glacially slow. Bugs like waiting for the ref who's holding the ball for no reason for 30 secs before handing it to a player for an in-bounds pass still exist decade later. Remove all cut scenes otherwise 10 min qtr games means you're playing for at least an hour.			"

												If you're assuming this game was overhyped and had way high expectations, then here's the review for you. This'll be quick.Anyways as an overview for this game, servers right now are terrible. No one online, first day of pre-release had vc hackings, server bugged for the vc store. Graphics? Amazing...if you could actually play on them. Is playable but has alloottt of lag. Like fr. Still waiting for that preorder key for the pre-ordering bonus. ): still didn't get it.My career? Terrible story. You are forced to be African-American (No problem with that) with an African American family, with one voice, as well as a terrible name (Frequency Vibrations [Freq]) and cannot create an individual character such as pale skinned, or tanned. You can't customize your character fully because of Spike Lee's stereotypical scenario which puts you into this ""world"" that is already pre-set. So gonna say. 2k Realized they needed to step up their game, brought in Spike Lee to make it happen. Didn't happen the way I wanted it to, but oh well. Graphics are majorly improved, but have more lag. Servers are trash right now. Multiplayer would be fun if nothing was hacked. Mycareer is just );< Could've been way more better in terms of the ""open"" world they were trying to create to actually ""live the dream"". But in future patches, well.. hope it'll better. 2k needs to step up the game on the pc platform. fr.			"

												NBA 2K16 is a great game, like its previous titles, but I'm giving it a negative review simply for the fact that the developers don't seem to fix the bugs that persisted through their previous titles. As well as some few good things that they don't seem to keep from their previous titles.1. Commentators cut off during the game sometimes. Commentary starts again at the next quarter.2. Referees sometimes just sit there with the ball for half a minute before giving it to you.3. There also seems to be problems with the VC sometimes not reaching the server properly.4. (Personal) I want the option to make a fantasy team with just the playoffs, whether it be MyGM or MyLeague. This was done in a previous 2K title. I don't know why they got rid of the option.Overall, almost nothing has changed from 2k15. I mean, there were a few changes that has inevitably made the game better (ie. speed mechanics, blocking fouls are now shooting fouls), and I understand that graphically theres only so much more they can do. It feels like there's way too much emphasis on MyCareer, if ONLY for the fact they earn more money from it. I would love to give you more money for your titles, if you released a title worthy of it. This to me tells me that the developers don't care much for the fans except for their money, and how to exploit that fact. But honestly this game is just 2k15 with different controls. Please at least fix the bugs before releasing your next game.			"

												The actual gameplay for this game is alright, almost great. So if you just want to shoot some hoops with a friend this is a nice sports game. However, if you care at all about the game delivering on its promises in any actual game mode besides quick matches, you'll be disappointed.Street - Sure, as long as you don't mind just walking around watching other people playing. You won't actually get to play any games, since as soon as you queue up, everyone else will leave, because they don't want to play with your low ranked scrub. If someone actually takes pity on you, get ready for the bashing of your life, seeing as your skills are probably mid stat and everyone else is maxed out. So time to open your wallet, pay good money and max out your character, wait another 20 minutes to even get into a game, lose anyway since everyone else also bought game potions.ProAm - I still haven't figured out how this works. As far as I can see it has the same tedious problems as Street - this is just a 5 man version.You character will still suck. And you'll have to wait 30 minutes or so to fill up all slots to get the game going. 2K advertises this as a game mode where you can create your own team where there is an actual ranking, but to my knowledge you won't get anywhere near actually playing as your custom team unless you bring 4 friends.Career - The ""Spike Lee joint"" part is ridiculous. 2K tries to feed you a storyline and crams in all kinds of characters that are supposed to add immersion. It does just the opposite. I have no idea why my white 5'8 geek was raised in an african-american family in Brooklyn. Nor why he speaks with the deep voice of a 7' giant. I mean, I get cut scenes where my stepmom (well, you explain it!) explains how she met my stepdad... and this is supposed to immerse me how exactly? How you perform in high school makes no difference. What college you choose makes no difference. How you perform during your rookie season makes no difference. Then onto your first real season playthrough. And chances are big you'll finish dead last in your conference. Make a trade, the sooner the better. For me, I still thought my team had a fighting chance of making the playoffs, so I stayed on until it was too late. Then came the last season game and after that - Boom! Next season. I didn't get to see how the playoffs went, no awards, no summary, nothing. Oh well, atleast I can request a trade now? Nope! You need to play 10 games the next season first. Oh, so is that like an NBA rule? I'll just sim through the first ten matches. No, no. You actually have to play 10 matches. The fu....? So I'm stuck on this roster for ten more games? I'll just sim through the rest of the season, maybe some other team will take an interest in me. Not going to happen, silly... Now you're back at the start of a new season on the same crappy roster. Only now, your popularity on the trade boards have gone from 100% to 10-15%.MyTeam - *Uninstalls game...* "

												The most annoying game you will ever play.-Controling you character is unresponsive and too scripted.-Turn off the commentators right away because they're poorly programed, will repeat sentences multiple times in a row and a lot of the time what they're saying makes no sense at all.-MyCareer story is simply - ♥♥♥♥. You are an honor student from the projects who is also an amazing b-ball player. Oh yeah also your nickname is ""Freq"".-""2K Beats"" is a soundtrack of then popular songs that are censored (it goes ""blow a kiss, **** * ***"" apperantly) and just repeat over and over until you lose sanity.And the worst part is:-The mother♥♥♥♥ing AI. Your teammates (that you don't control) can't play defence or offence at all.On D they can't deffend the pick & roll and are unable to rotate so when I play great defence but my team allows 15 inside baskets I can't do ♥♥♥♥.On offence They either hog the ball untill time runs out or you call for the pass or they try a hand at the worst possble solution so they ♥♥♥♥ up your whole day.In conclusion: Awful AI, boring and unnecessey MyCareer story, bad soundtrack, bad controls.How to fix: Hire better programmers, keep to a simple story, bring back 2k12 soundtrack, make your player more responsive to controls.If you read all of this I feel bad for you son, I got 99 reccomendations but this game isn't one.

												This game is probably the only game that has aggrivated me enough to write a review. I bought this game to play with my friends. I thought it would be better than the old NBA 2K games but its not. Now im not the best gamer for NBA; however this game is clunky with or without the ball. With some practice it will get better but thats not what pushed me over the edge. What my problem with this game is, is that when you create a character you are automatically a black highschooler from the ghetto in New York. Why can't i be white? This is saying to me that you cannot be white to play in the NBA, which isnt true, but also it tells me that the majority of their audience is black. This to me is racist. I HIGHLY dislike this game and think it is a waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT!			"

												Ok, so first off, 2K straight up lied to us about pre-order bonuses and said that we would get 3 emerald packs (which would ensure us all 3 emerald cards) and low and behold, I get 2 bronze's and 1 gold. That is 100% false advertising. Also, the game lags like crazy and the loading times are especially slow. Yes, go ahead, tell me I'm being too harsh because the game hasn't even officially been released yet. These things however, have nothing to do with the problems I'm experiencing with the actual game right now. That is for another rant. 2k, you and your team have turned one of my most beloved franchises into absolute monetizable garbage. Time to sweep you under the rug.			"

												If you're interested in simulation basketball, this game runs a mean fast break on all previous iterations -- I'm talking New Jersy Nets Gerald Green head above the rim alley oop windmill dunk. Gone are the days of the ubiquitous jack-of-all-trades superstars. More than ever, the basketball IQ of the person behind the controller matters, and I welcome that. Sure, some cheaters still exist, but, if you learn at least part of the art of basketball, it's not a forgone conclusion that you'll lose.Despite the backlash against MyCareer mode this year, it's an enjoyable mode with a storyline that can be forgotten entirely after your rookie season. In fact, from the second season forward, this mode is probably the most in-depth and satisfying career mode in any sports game. If you're considering buying this game, don't listen to those who wished for the moon and were delivered a game rooted in great basketball mechanics.There are so many modes in this game (I'll let you read about them elsewhere) that any basketball fan should be able to find something they like.

For the last few months since I was blocked out I have been playing offline modes, which quickly became stale and repetitive. What really pisses me off is that I was really enjoying this game despite all the negative reviews, and now i just feel ripped off. My brief time with the online gameplay was great, but with my experience it is difficult to recommend this game.			"

												Great game, very different from the past releases. They have completely remodeled the defense making it a lot harder to just zig zag through the cpu's defense which means you have to really work hard for those shots. Also passing is different with new controls and animations and with the new defense some passes are you may have used to do are a lot harder leading in several turnovers They have added a lot more gameplay animations blocks are more realistic, player movements are alot better with faster reaction times. Each player also has their own way of playing. Also body animations are added such as flexing playing with their mouth guard, dunk face animations, gum chewing, etc.The rating system makes more sense this year even though some of you may disagree they are doing it by comparing the players ability to the greatest in that area like for example the best avg rebounder is Dennis Rodman so he has a 99 OFF and 95 DEF in rebounding compared to a current dominating rebounder with DeAndre Jordan who is given a 92 OFF and 94 DEF and same goes for other attributes so if you dont like it, no one cares.MyCareer also has the Spike Lee storyline which has lots of mixed feelings. I just want to mention in my opinions stop b*tching just cause yoour family is black, there are countless games that I've played where I'm given a family that looks nothing like me as a created player and like many others we dont complain we just play and enjoy what they give us. Also they'd need more voice actors which would be too expensive for something they're just trying out.Any way in MyCareer you now have offdays where you get to do either connections (haging out with someone in the leauge such as player, teamowner, celeb) where you get rewards like VC or my favourite you get to pick your game day jersey. Also there's training on off-days for attribute boosts and Endorsments that also give VC. So those are all your choice. Only problem I have with it is you play 3 HS games and 4 College no VC games but are fun and only 8 rookie season games while I would prefer having the whole rookie season to play.MyGm has been redesigned and is more realistic with team relocation added.My Team added several new things like player cards that attributes change as the season goes by with their performance. I may missed some stuff but if this hasn't made you want the game, I don't know what will.So if you want the best NBA... No, a sports game of all time. Here it is.Well till 2K releases something better anyway.			"

												This game is so terrible you cannot even call it a sports game you simulate the whole time, the only people who would enjoy this are people who enjoy being accused of fouls for simply standing in front of a player or taking shots and watching as they constantly miss, please do not buy and support this game, there is so much wrong with this like the horrible mechanics how wonky the controling of a player is and just how it seems to flow so awfully.. Please pass to something else im sure the old NBA 2k games were bad but definitely not this bad...sDxѮ'#Murp 5 hours ago  I saw a post on reddit about how you can pay to have wins in the game....

												The Spike Lee Joint portion of this game does not take your gameplay into account at all. It's irrelevant how poorly you play, you are a superstar and that's it. Still, the actors are seemingly giving this annual release of a sports game their all and that makes the lengthy cutscenes in between games worth checking out. The story line certainly goes to some peculiar, melodramatic places that can be entertaining in ways that aren't always intentional. If you snagged this, give the MyCareer mode a try.			"

												Only played 33 hours so far but gameplay and my career mode have been improved nicely so far! Even more realistic than last years game, get ready for some authentic basketball! You start off now in High school and do some games then you get some offers for college basketball and you pick where to go. Then you get to play college games and then off to the NBA! Nice improvement to My Career no doubt! 2k just keeps improving!I will edit this review after 50 hours or so again. So far so good though, only issue I have had so far is that the preorder bonuses are not working yet (I think they might not unlock until the game fully comes out on tuesday). Everyone seems to be writing bad reviews because they don't like Spike Lee, pretty pathetic if you ask me. This game has the best gameplay every in a 2k game and people are angry a black director helped on My Career mode.The game is also running very well (75-80 fps for me atm) and I am not having many issues, just hoping to get my preorder bonus on tuesday and I will be set. Sports gaem of the year so far! Better than Fifa and madden so far.			"

												This game is really a piece of ♥♥♥♥, nothing works in here and I'm really, really tired of getting it another chance. It's by far the worst NBA 2K I've ever played. Everything that worked one day about the gameplay, doesn't work in here. The only good thing to say about it is that some annoyng bugs of previous versions where, finally, resolved. For the rest, rules doesn't work good, the CPU has some magic moves to steal balls, making impossible shots and you, even whith a perfect release, can't even make an open shot with Ray Allen, totally realistic. I'm not buying anything from 2K for a long time, because I give them too many chances, not anymore. And, again, nothing online is good here, no one to play, bugs, hacks, why do I even try?			"

												After playing on free weekend, I'm glad I didn't purchase it. It was buggy and the graphics were not on par with 2015. The game however, was easy to pick up on, having never played any sports games before. If this is your first, I would suggest looking elsewhere for quality because you won't find it here. Glitches were everywhere and made it near impossible to play.  I feel I don't have enough to properly review it, but I can say what what I had played, this game is not all it was cracked up to be.

												NBA 2k was once a respectable franchise, 2K16 was the first I got on pc however the devs give absolutely nothing about the PC community and just like last few years. The game is full of bugs and gamebreaking glitches. The reason I keep coming back is the pre release hype, this time being the MyCareer story mode that on a sidenote is completely garbage, I'm not black and not from Harlem so its not even your own career.The online community is toxic and full of hackers, the 7ft center of last year are 5 ft '11 guards this year, for new players there is no point in getting the game this time of the year because when you go online nobody will play with you because you are a low rated player, everyone is a 99 overall in the first weeks of the game.The controls feel sticky and the gameplay is slow compared to 2k10,11 and 12.If you're not a basketball fanatic, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

												This game is terrible. I can't describe it any other way.Granted, I am a very casual gamer so maybe I don't have the patience required for this game but there are so many things wrong with it.Cons-Career mode is a joke. Your player is so bad it's not even fun. Misses 75% of his shots, can't shoot freethrows, it's just aweful. -Constant UI lag. I don't know what's wrong with this game, but it seems like everything you do is horribly slow. Press the X button for a jump shot and your player will travel for almost no reason (like a player can't do a jump shot on the move or something?). Release the shooting button on time and you'll actually be late (falling down or away once you release) for again no reason. This is not a Specs Issue either, I'm running a machine with specs much higher than recommended. -Game is just horrible with Steam Controller, I couldn't recommend playing in this manner to anyone. The dunk stick just dosn't work right because Steam had to be different and go with some sort of scroll pad.-Learning Curve is too high for casual players. I'll do a simple pick and role and the player will just pass to someone else. How stupid is that? I call for a pick and roll and go to pass, and the player kicks it out to someone on the wing who's being guarded...game is so poorly designed in this regard. -Driving to the basket is unneccesarily difficult. The game actuallly punishes you for not running designed plays and maintaining a certain tempo about your play. In real life (I have NBA league Pass) these players would not miss the chances I create in the game when driving to the basket. Yet I almost nearly always miss when driving to the hoop. I also cannot shoot 3's because the shooting command on Steam Controller is delayed or something. I tap X to shoot and the player releases the ball a milisecond before coming back down to the floor. Like the type of real-life shot a player would make as he's getting fouled near the basket. Complete garbage.-Passing is also not right. I can't tell you how many times I move out to the wing and try to pass directly to the center who's got some space and the ball gets picked off in a manner that isn't consisten with the physics of basketball. Again, the game is designed to force you to play a certain way and you cannot simply work around that. -The substitute menu freezes often and interferes with what would be the bounce pass or B button on my controller (configurations vary). It causes me to have to restart, in which case I generally just turn off the game.Overall I don't have the patience to learn to be good at this game and I think it's a horrible waste of time and money.

The graphic is pretty good the game mchanics are also good. The only downside are the minor bugs like having a ball inside the face or the shorts going up to the waist, and whe I was changing the lips on myplayer he couldnt speack normal anymore his lips wher e moving way to fast.

												For all you basket ball lovers then this game is for you however im not recommneding it as it is clearly designed for console or use with a controller having just sold my PS4 lol i will soon no longer have a controller and that is quite annoying. You cant really get anywhere without a controller as its very annoying and you can hardly do anything			"

												Well when you can play it`s a fun game, but when 2K turns into the lazy aasss motherfu*kers you don`t even get to play the actual game and you will have to sit on your chair/sofa/whatever and wait untill they finally fix the servers... I only say that this game is good because it`s fun to play... But if you are not patient enough. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever buy this game. that`s all.Peace.			"
