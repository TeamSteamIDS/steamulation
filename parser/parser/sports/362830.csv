												A very simple, straight-forward MiniGolf game. The fundementals are not bad, but each hole seems to be a variation on the original hole with some obstacles in the way. I was hoping for something a little more picturesque, or elaborate. Winmills, Some kind of theme to the overall course, anything could have made this a fun game. As such, it felt very repetitious and was overly simple with a hole in one being easy to score on several holes of the first course. Normally, I can find at least a few positive things for a game, but even the music annoyed me to a point, it was like Harvest Moon on repeat, Save your money folks, The PGA games, or even some of the Tiger Woods games offer so much more value for your buck.

												This game rubs me the wrong way in too many places for me to be able to recommend it.  For one, there's only local multiplayer and not online multiplayer.  Next, the camera controls are limited in that you can only change the angle by changing your shot angle.  I would like to be able to zoom around the hole freely so I know what I'm getting into, say, over a hill (which you can't see over from where you're standing).  Also, getting the ball in the hole is referred to as ""pocketing the ball""...is this billiards or golf?  There's also no golf terms like eagle, birdie, bogey, double bogey, etc...it's just Par+0, etc.  This is as basic as miniature golf gets and frankly, it's not enough to justify the price tag.

												Firstly, let me remind you about the lack of online multi player - which they have since edited the store page to indicate this, AFTER I brought it, partly because of that point.Visual ""next"" prompts get annoying too, especially when I'm trying to lower my score to match PAR, even on single player (one to begin the match, another to indicate I'm to play).Graphics are good, but I wouldn't say overwhelming; on a few occasions the graphics glitched out for me and the camera was placed under the map for some reason. 5/10, over par with a bad handicap. Much prefer 3d ultra mini golf, even though it's probably over a decade old.			"

One-Sentence SummaryA simplistic, bare-bones minigolf game that suffers from really bad physics, stiff controls, dull gameplay mechanics, numerous bugs, and strange interpretations of minigolf rules and terminology.Pros+ It's a no-frills, straightforward minigolf game (sorta)Cons- The ball moves and feels like a weightless ping-pong ball- The wall deflection angles are really wonky- No camera free-look controls, zoom, or map to plan shots- The swing mechanics are not fun and require no skill- The single music track loops quickly and gets repetetive- ""Par"" for every hole is a hole-in-one!  What?!- Strange boundary mechanic and ball drop rules- Numerous bugs and odd design choicesFinal ThoughtsI've been looking for a nice, straightforward minigolf game without all the wackiness and superflous zany things that usually are often put in to ""spice up"" the core game.  3D MiniGolf, on the surface, looked like it might fit that criteria.  Unfortunately, the terrible ball physics and lack of ability to plan shots really detracts from the experience.  I think a simple two-click swing mechanic could have worked OK in a simple minigolf game like this if the ball physics were at least somewhat realistic, but as it stands it just feels like you are smashing a ping-pong ball around in some alternate universe where momentum and deflection angles do not exist.Additionally, for golf/minigolf enthusiasts, the strange use of terminology and rule interpretations make the game seem like it was programmed by someone who has never actually played a round of golf in their life.  Things like par for every hole being a hole-in-one make it impossible to score below par.  The use of the term ""par +1"" instead of bogey or just flat out a number of strokes.  Strange boundary lines on the actual green which if you don't cross you have to drop your ball again from the start.While I respect the idea and ambition to create a simple, straightforward minigolf game, this one needs a lot of work and refinement in order for it to actually be any fun to play.Suggested AlternativeGolf With Your Friends, also available on Steam, is an excellent alternative for those looking for a simple yet well-made minigolf game.

This is by far the worst minigolf game I've ever played.I spent twice as much time waiting in between holes and shots than I did actually playing the game. When I did get to play, it was monotonous and infuriating.Pros:● NoneCons:● Physics are horrible!● Hole designs are boring.● Aiming is a bit wonky.● Slow loading and obnoxious menus.● BuggyThe physics are downright awful. Good luck figuring out how much power you need to get up a hill or across a slanted platform because the ball will not react how you expect it to. This can cause the levels that aren't just a straight shot to the hole to be immensely infuriating. Sometimes the ball will bounce off something and then start spazzing out, bouncing up and down repeatedly until it comes to a stop.The hole designs are boring. Half of them seem to be straight shots to the hole which make the added obstacles pointless. There are some with ramps and slopes that take a thousand tries before you hit that one lucky shot that works. These are super obnoxious. The rest, while they have a few twists and turns or bounces, are still really boring to look at. The courses have next to no decoration. A lot of holes have unfair pars, so if you're in challenge mode you get restart the level a million times to hit your shot perfectly for that hole-in-one. Some of the holes also reset or move your ball if you don't land your shot in the marked area. There is seemingly no point to this feature.The aiming seemed a bit off. The aiming arrow is really short and practically useless. I swear I always had to aim slightly to the left of where I thought the arrow was actually pointing. Not to mention when the game sets you up for your next shot, half the time it points you in the complete wrong direction and have to slowly turn yourself the correct way.The most obnoxious thing of all though is how much time is wasted not actually playing the game. When you start up a hole, it takes a few seconds to load, then you need to click past a menu that pops up, then you have to watch or click to skip the hole preview, then it tells you it's your turn and you have to click continue again (Even if you're in single player!), all before you finally get to shoot. Then once you shoot, sometimes your ball takes forever to come to a stop and there is no way to skip this. You just have to wait. Then as I said above, sometimes on follow-up shots the game will point you in the wrong direction, further wasting your time. For every hole you get to repeat that process over and over again.Lastly the game is buggy. When I alt+tabbed out of the game I could not get back in. The game would just not come up. It happened multiple times and I had to kill the game through the task manager. One time I went to load up a new tournament and the game just hung on a black screen forcing me again kill it through the task manager. If you try to turn the music off (it's repetitive) by moving the music slider to 0, it does work, but every time you restart the game the music comes back until you go back into the menu and click on the down arrow again. Also, if I hit the hole but the ball bounced out/ringed the cup, half the time the game would play the sound effect like if the ball had gone in. Then of course there was the ball spazzing out, bouncing up and down sometimes as well.I had hoped for the best, but this game was the worst. I've played free Flash golf games that were way better than this. If you're thinking about buying this game, don't waste your money. If you already got this in a bundle or something and are thinking about playing this game, don't waste your time.			"

												There is a big problem with this game : BUGS ! When you play a tournament, sometimes, the ball go through the hole, disapears or reappears farther and it's considered a miss. Worse, sometimes, the bug continues and you have to restart the whole tournament !			"

												The physics seem very obviously off. If you've played pool or actual mini golf, you have some idea about the direction a ball should bounce when it hits a wall from a certain angle, but in this game that relation often seems completely random. There are times the ball will hit a wall at an angle and then bounce directly back in the direction it came from, which shouldn't happen. Makes it unplayable unless you want to sit and randomly try different angles against walls until you get lucky. Waste of 10 bucks. I'm a little annoyed.			"

												With only 3 courses available you will probably get bored very quickly. limited replayability. A level editor would be a real boost and the ability to share these maps as well as online multiplay.Very bugged game. No window mode. Cant switch in and out of game without it locking up. Actually had to decrease grafx setting to get the game to even work...seriously wth. All that being said I think it would actually be a good game/distraction if these bugs where fixed. Requires a lot of graphic optimisation. Until then im not going to recomend this game. If this had a star rating instead of a recomend yes/no i would give it 2/5 and if the above faults where fixed i'd give it 4/5Having said the above, it is selling at -80% off at the time of writing this so buy it im sure the bugs will be ironed out.Edit: Actually managed to play a whole game without issues.

												Very bad game.No real mechanics.  You line the shot up, You pull the mouse back to how hard you want to hit ball...once you are happy, you click your mouse to actually hit it.  There's no type of swing mechanic, no 3 click golf type mechanic or anything else...tahts it.  You say how hard you want to hit it on their gauge, you line it up with mouse, then you click to let the game proceed.On top of that, the rebound mechanics seem horribly off.  Basically one shot I hit towards a wall at an angle, and instead of travelling off the angle in the other direction like it's suppose to, it came back to me as if i hit it straight on at the wall instead.  Also, some walls seemed to be sticky or something, the ball would hit it, and slide along it instead of bouncing back.A very poor attempt, glad I got this in a bundle.			"

												The holes are all standard mini-golf setups.  Most holes are either a complete miss where you just hit restart or a hole in one.  There aren't really any par 2 or par 3 holes where you try and get below par.  You are pretty much just shooting for a hole-in-one on every shot.  This doesn't work very well for this kind of game and doesn't really encourage you to try this playing against someone else.  I played practically the same game 10-15 years ago.			"

												Wow.How can you build a golf game without a proper physics engine, where THE ANGLES DON'T WORK!Seriously. Hole 4 is unbeatable. It involves playing two right angle turns. So of course, you angle your putt to bounce off the walls at roughly 45 degrees. Imagine my surprise when the ball bounces back at 180 degrees. Leaving it right where it started. And on this hole it puts you back to the tee if you don't make the first corner. Literally making this unplayable.Piece of crap game.			"

												Temporary review.Quite a good game. Could be more challenging, but lacking skill levels, a game for all players. Controls are very simple, and easy to use with one hand. Appears to be disabled accessible in many ways (though no telling if it's intentional.)The achievements are appropriate and worthwhile. The more I play, the more fun it gets to be. This is one I intend to finish.Wish the courses were a bit more exciting, but there's time for that later (hopefully.) Maybe a little pricey for 54 holes, but I was fortunate to get this nice little game as a gift. Can't get used to swinging through the barriers, but no big deal. More when there's more.

												I love mini-golf/crazy-golf, and had high hopes for this game. Unfortunately, while it was fun for a short while, the bugs and limited courses get boring quickly. UXThe actual controls are okay, but there are long delays between responses where you aren't sure if the game registered what you are trying to do or not. Restart on the challenges should put you back ready to take your shot, but puts you back before the preview of the course, for example.Also, there are bugs where sometimes you put the ball in the hole, but it lags for 20 seconds, then registers the stroke, but either puts the ball back where it was before your last shot, or hides it beneath the ground, both forcing you to restart.COURSESThe 18 courses available are great for a tutorial, but once you get into tournaments, it is disappointing to find out that those 18 courses are the only courses in the game, and you play them in the same order everytime. The game needs a lot more variety of courses, and many more difficult challenges.SUMMARYThere is a little fun to be had here, but the game still needs a lot of work. I woudn't recommend buying this on it's own, but if you get it in a bundle, it's worth a little play.			"

												In general, I simply can't recommend this game. Some people will be able to enjoy it and you should think about whether or not you fall into that category as you read my review. There are several things that need to happen before you can enjoy this game even a little. You need to be able to tolerate ""low budget / low quality"" games, really simple ""gets the job done"" physics (which really don't work that well) and you need to be able to enjoy the mere act of ""pocketing the ball,"" since any other features are essentially non-existent in this game. You may be able to enjoy some local play with friends or family, but I could imagine most people would look at you funny if you tried to make them play this game.Detailed Review:-It's a mini-golf game at its core and despite its poor physics, features and general quality there don't seem to be any game breaking bugs or flaws. Despite aiming being difficult due to the camera, the ball will almost always go where it should. -There is a diversity of courses which offer [very] minor changes to standard courses, giving you a bit of variety as you play through a tournament. But, IMO the courses are mostly uninspired and far too similar, plus some of the obstacles are pretty iffy when combined with the low quality physics. -There is a tournament mode where you can play against AI players on various difficulties, but the difficulty / AI (like the physics) is there just to ""get the job done"" and doesn't feel like it's actually dynamic on how the players are arriving at their scores. Even on the typical straight-line hole-in-one hole there were AI players taking over 6 shots to ""pocket the ball"" and defaulting to a score of +7, which is rather silly. -There are challenge modes where you can play a course over and over until you get a hole and one. It's kind of a neat mode except for the fact that it really highlights some of the problems with the game. Every single hole in the game has a par of 1. That means, unless you get a hole-in-one, that you are over par for that hole. This is the main reason that so many of the courses feel almost identical when played since they're all basically one and done, where you're aiming right down the middle of where you need to go. It also contributes to a less enjoyable experience since you're constantly reminded that anything above a hole-in-one is above par, and thus essentially a failure.Ultimately, this game is worth a shot if you can pick it up for $1-2. It's an almost certainty that it really isn't worth your money, even at that cost, but for mini-golf nerds like myself, it isn't really worth passing up for only a buck. Like I said, there isn't really anything insulting/game breaking in the game, so you pretty much get exactly what you'd expect from a game that you only paid a dollar for. At >$2, don't ever, EVER buy this game. Seriously, don't.			"

												ORIGINAL POST: This game does not have online multiplayer!This is a 1-4 player game under one purchase. I bought two copies of this game, one for myself and one for a friend and unfortunately it doesn't have online capabilities :(EDIT: As far as the game mechanics go, they are a little flimsy and the ""handicap"" white lines on the first 18 holes are a bit intrusive. As others have stated, Hole 11 has a spot where the camera is obstructed, which results in having to take a blind shot at an attempt to move your ball.The reason I recommend this game is due to the fact that it works well for their intended audience. Their tagline states ""Mini Golf for the whole family"", incinuating that the game is local only (which was originally stated as Co-op) and it works well in a family environment. Their target audience can be hit dead on with this game, however it wasn't originally marketed that way.Overall, I enjoyed playing the game solo but none of it was entirely challenging. If you like Steam Achievements and don't mind dropping a couple bucks, then go ahead and buy this game. But if you're a serious gamer and enjoyed the unrelated 3D Ultra Mini Golf game, then I don't recommend this game for you.Hope this helps :)			"
