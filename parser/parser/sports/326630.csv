												Sports Interactive’s Football Manager franchise gets some flak for its lack of innovation year on year. However at least it gets it right. Club Manager 2015 is an attempt to compete with the might of Football Manager, and it most certainly does not get it right. It has some things that Football Manager doesn’t, but the amount it removes, and the poor quality of the core concepts makes this a product not worth spending your money on.The menu system is appalling, and when the whole game is designed around using menus, you know you are going to be in for a bad time. You open a window to view some information and then have to look around for the button to close it, because it changes based on what kind of menu you open. The localisation is poor, to the point where you are sometimes just not sure what certain stats mean. I spend a long time thinking that “Strength” meant, you know, strength. However it’s actually an overall rating for the team or player.There is a semblance of a match engine so you can see highlights of your games. However it doesn’t use the kit colours you pick for your team, and all it does is rehash the same ten or so animations over and over. Since there are so few options, you would have thought they at least would look good, but nope. Once you turn off all the extraneous stuff, you can blast through a season quite quickly, in under an hour or so. You get into the rhythm of choosing your training program for the week and then jumping into the next match. The training system isn’t robust at all, you simply choose whether you want certain players to work on their general play, their energy, or their stamina. There is an odd way of dealing with sponsorship. Before home games you can essentially bet on the outcome, and if you get it right your sponsor will give you a certain amount of money. You can expand your stadium and change ticket and merchandising prices and the like, but it’s not rewarding. The way you deal with buying and selling new players is bizarre. You approach a player you want to buy, and if they don’t want to join your club it won’t even let you bid any money for them. You can’t even make plans to buy players since it won’t let you do anything on the transfer market outside of the transfer window.Even when you have got the players you need, choosing your team is difficult because the formations don’t look like they are supposed to. Also I’ve still not worked out how to make substitutions during a match.Club Manager 2015 has very few redeeming qualities to speak of. There’s no way you can get major things wrong and it brings nothing new to the table. It’s a little bit cheaper than Football Manager, but the price needs to drop a whole lot more for it to be worth the price. If you’re really on a budget and want to manage a football team, just buy an older version of Football Manager, it’ll still be better than this.			"

												A pretty good football business management game. Would more accurately be named Football Club Director. I can easily recommend it to anyone who enjoys management games, and especially to anyone who plays Football Manager and always wanted to try playing as the Chairman instead of the Manager.See, unlike FM, where you manage the team in great detail but any big financial decisions are an endless struggle with the board, here you ARE the board but have limited control over the football side of the team. This means the main gameplay is deciding how to spend your limited finances. There's no transfer budget, no wage budget, no restrictions on building and improving stadiums, no restrictions on staff, no limits on youth spending, etc. You just have to choose what's best to invest in.One of the main things you'll be doing, of course, is buying and selling players. Much like in FM, you need reputation to attract better players. Once on your team, players' value will increase when they play in matches. Negotiations are thankfully quite simple and straightforward, and there are no infuriating agents around to mess with you.A pretty cool aspect of the game is the Youth teams feature. You have 6 tiers of Youth squads made up of kids in different age brackets, from 17-18 years old in team A all the way to 7-8 years old in team F. You can only bring those 17 and over into the main squad, but the ones you see in the younger groups are the ones you'll have available years down the line. You set a Youth budget at the start of every season and it determines how quickly the youngsters' skills increase and how talented the new recruits are. Youngsters with higher talent will grow their skills faster. While you can't really fill your entire team with home-grown talent and compete at the top level, you can get at least 1-2 top level players per season if you invest enough to get talented kids and let them reach their potential.It's important to note that once you bring a youth player into the main squad, and this applies to everyone else in your main squad too, you won't get the quick skill progression available in youth training. Regular skill training for the senior squad is almost ineffectual, and most of the starting 11's training will be focused on recovering their fitness/condition after matches anyway.However, there are 2 factors that offset this. First, there are training camps at the start and the middle of every season. These cause random increases in skill for a few players. The impact depends on which camp you go to. The basic camp, in Germany, is free and provides little benefits (sometimes no increase in skill at all!). Other camps cost way more than a small team could afford, so you'll only be able to use them once you get rich.Second, at the end of every season, some players will gain a fair amount of skill and others will lose some. I've not been able to figure out how exactly the game decides who to buff or nerf and by how much.Another prominent feature in the game are stadiums. There are tons of options for them, including type of stand (standing or seated, roof or no roof) and number of seats for the 4 sides of the stadium; different ticket prices for the different types of stand; VIP sections and catering; internal upgrades like pitch surface, floodlights, loudspeakers, toilets, TV screens, refreshments, security, etc.; external upgrades like bus stops, tram lines and train lines, roads and parking lots, restaurants and merchandise shops, training fields and youth centers, doctor's offices and business offices. Overall, a lot of the gameplay is about how to manage your stadium. Upgrades are expensive and money is tight, so choose wisely what to invest in.What's probably a dealbreaker for many people is that there's no match engine. You get a video on every goal opportunity, but other than that it's like playing FM on Commentary Only. Personally, I'm completely okay with that. It lets you focus on the long-term growth of the club rather than match minutiae.And speaking of long-term growth, there's a lot of that. The game features only one league system, a semi-realistic German one, with 8 tiers. Those at the bottom are so far from those at the top that we're talking orders of magnitude. People who like to take super obscure teams in FM and turn them into world champions will probably feel at home here. For extra zero to hero potential, you can found your own club, with not a single player, no reputation to speak of, a tiny stadium with no upgrades, and some starting capital.It's also possible to just take over management of a major team (You can take any team from any of the 8 tiers), but that isn't very appealing, as there's little growth possible.Another thing worth mentioning is that tactics aren't deep. You only choose a formation. Basically, choose the one that lets you have the highest total skill on the field. Players don't have any positional ratings outside of GK/DF/MF/FW, so players in those 4 groups can be used interchangeably. Other than that, you have an aggression setting, which, as far as I can tell, makes your team play a bit better but also get injured and booked more. And the final tool with which you can influence a match is the win bonus, up to €20,000, to be shared among the players if they win. Only use it for really important matches while you're still small.Now, onto the game's problems:First and foremost, there's an unbelievably stupid ""feature"" that would much more accurately be described as a bug. See, one of your few sources of income is selling merchandise. You buy it from the manufacturer, set a price, and sell it primarily at home games. But, I'm not kidding, if you have any merchandise left in stock at the end of the season, it's just gone for good. You get no compensation. And you can only buy merchandise in the first 15 days of a season. This means you have to save at the start of a season, buy lots of merchandise, then speed-play through it to the end, then look at how much merchandise was sold, then load the save from the start of the season and try to estimate how much to buy for real. And you have to do it EVERY SEASON. I just went ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and decided to use Cheat Engine to give myself some money instead.Another stupid issue with the game is that while it's possible to change the soundtrack volume when you start a game, there's no way to change the volume of the main menu music, and it's waaaay too loud. So much so that I mostly just disable my PC's sound entirely before starting the game, so I don't have to turn the volume down then up every time. What's more, I'm fairly sure the different tracks aren't normalized, but it's hard to tell when they're so loud to begin with.Also, even in-game, there's no way to change the volume of sound effects.Yet another stupid issue is that it's impossible to exit to the main menu or to load a saved game while in-game. You have to exit to desktop, then start the game again, then load a save from the main menu. And every time you start the game, you have to click through a ton of screens, for no reason that I can imagine.An annoying issue is that it takes a very long time for the game to save and load, especially for a game of such relatively limited scope. Usually I just get up and do something else while I'm waiting for it to save or load.A further issue is the UI, specifically exiting menus. The X button with which you close most menus is much too small and hard to click, so it would have been very useful if the right mouse button had the same exact function. But instead, the RMB takes you all the way to the game's main screen, closing everything.A minor issue is the poor translation. Sometimes funny, rarely confusing. Somewhat breaks immersion.Overall, the game's strengths significantly outweigh its weaknesses, and I find it quite enjoyable.			"

												First things first: This game is so poorly made it's painful. Just moving around screens feels like navigating the web on a 56k, and saving? Good grief. It's not like the game is full of data points that need updating, but you'd think it was 100x the scale of Football Manager judging by how long your first save will take.It is designed terribly, too. Menus are confusing, the visual hierarchy is screwed up, and the design language is inconsistent. It's a mess.This can all be forgiven but there are little things that make it such a hassle to even start. What's the difference, for example, betweent talent and str? When saving, why does it ask if you want to overwrite a score when it saves? That's just two of many. Honestly, I'm not going to play a game that's a hassle, not unless it's overtly great, and this? This isn't even close.Don't waste your money.			"

												This game, while having it's quirks and limitations is actually a very good football club director simulator. I say director, because there's very little management in the traditional sense. It focuses more on the business side of things, while keeping a level of simple, distilled gameplay akin to that of the DOS games of old (Football Limited jumps out as an example).The game only features the German leagues, and quite unrealistically too, as there are 8 divisions down to what is known IRL as the Kreisliga (aka City Leagues) but strangely, the game features a completely 1 to 1 linear structure, not the pyramid football fans are used to.The match engine is almost non-existent, with opaque number crunching happening behind the scenes and small highlights appearing every chance or goal, but nevertheless it's solid enough to make the business side of things fun. One gripe I have is that the engine seems to make a big deal of underestimation, where if you have a vastly superior team, your team has a chance of completely being swept aside, although I have noticed that upping the win bonus to about 5000 euros and higher offsets this somewhat, while also giving you an edge in closer matches.The facilities building feature is great, you get to pick what parts of your stadium and grounds you want to upgrade, and it gives you a birds eye view of the area, where you can slowly build the crown jewel of your footballing empire. Of course, it's mostly in 2D but it's a nice touch anyway. Adding crowd capacity is easy, as is upgrading them from standing room, to seating with roofs. VIP boxes are also a part of the game, and you can even add catering, TV systems and service.The transfer market is quite iffy though, you can only buy players in January and July, with no ability to offer in the off-period and get them when the window starts. The negotiations are simple and to the point, as the game will tell you how close you are to them closing negotiations by shrinking their happiness bar. Contracts are pretty much the same.You may obtain sponsors, usually a main sponsor with bonuss based on wins, matches, promotiona and avoiding relegation, and as of update 1.42 you can get other sponsors which just pay a certain fee every month. Also of note is merchandisng, which you must stock for an entire season before July 15th or risk not being eble to sell anything. It's an exciting system which is certainly more fun than checking every so often to restock on a permanent basis.You may buy player insurance which pays you when players get injured, I personally haven't used it, but it's a nice touch. You may also speculate on the share market, which I haven't done either. Also of note is socking money away as ban investment and getting it back a 1 to 7 years later with interest. The longer the term, the higher the interest rate.Actually setting the formations is a chore that is confusing as hell, which is why I say it's more of a business simlator, it's so deep in business but lacking in actual management. No tactics to speak of, but I guess that's what makes the game so simple and fun. Usually, I just hire an assistanr manager to do both training and squad picking.There's a plethora of stats screens in this game, which is a nice touch. I also love the found a club mode, reminds me a lot of the days when I played FIFA Manager religiously, back when it was actually good.Anyway, I guess I should close this review now, so let me outline the pros and cons.PROS:* Good football club business sim* Stadium and ground building is nice* Financial options are plentiful* Plenty of stats* You can hire staff to do the actual football stuffCONS:* The actual football side of things is sorely lacking* The transfer market is confusing and restrictive* Formations are hard, especially with no tactics* 30 dollars/euros/pounds is a bit much, prices aren't currency converted either.OVERALL:A good game for the tycoon guys out there with an interest in football. If you like football management games but find Football Manager too hard and complex, this could be good for you. If you're a diehard football manager, keep playing FM, you might not like this. If you love both tycoon games and football, you'll love this game.			"

http://www.gamersftw.co.uk/club-manager-2015/Club Manager 2015 takes you into the back-end of how a football team is run; from selecting the right players to taking your team to glory; to the actual running of the club; and even right down to designing the stadium.As you start, you will be run through a few helpful screens which will give you the basics of how to use the interface. Unfortunately, this will happen every time you start the game; making you click ‘Next’ often, just so that you can get to the main title screen.Once you do start though, the game begins to take shape as something well worth playing. As you click on ‘New Game’ you are given the option to name your player; decide on how many players you would like to have in the game; game difficulty; and whether you would like to use an existing club or found your own.Founding your own club will make the game far more difficult because, unlike selecting a pre-existing club, you start with some money and that’s it. You have to do everything from build your stadium; to buying players; to competing in matches.Unlike most football management games, CM15 lets you see everything that you can do with your club. You can manage your team by:changing your squad layout;defining the training parameters;seeing who’s contract will be expiring soon;whether or not you want to keep them;buying new players; as well asrenting your own players out to other teams.Managing the club gives you the opportunity to hire staff to help you to run the club.  It also provides the opportunity of checking your youth team’s status; and deciding how much you want to spend on their annual training.  You can also check your prestige and view the history of the club.Once you get into the finer points of managing a club, your work includes building the stadium and raising finances.As an example, you can’t run a football club without some good revenue coming in and the one way to do this is to make sure that your stadium look pretty. CM15 gives you a view of the exterior of the stadium where you can build everything to help players enhance their skills and even build bus stops for the fans.The interior of the club gives you the tools to build your stadiums stands; the floodlights and even the public toilets.  The better the appearance of the stadium, the more fans will come and watch your team.You can also set ticket and merchandise pricing as well as purchase the merchandise yourself, as well as deciding on how much you want in your store at any one time.Financing the club is also made quite easy. You can apply for credit; choose sponsors; adjust merchandise prices; and get investments, all of which will either make or break your club. You can even insure a valuable player.You also have a manager’s pass which will warn you when there is something wrong anywhere in your club. This little tool is very helpful when you don’t want to look through every detail of the club simply to find a problem.As you click ‘Next’ you will move up the calendar days until either a match day; match draw; or construction completion comes up, if a match day comes up you will be taken to the match screen where you will have to decide on the line-up or, alternatively, let your assistant coach choose the best line-up. You will then move to the pre-match screen. Here it is made easy for you to decide on how you want your team to perform and whether or not to give them a bonus if they win. Both are slide bars from ;do little; to ;play aggressively. You are then moved to the match screen where you can watch the time run up and adjust the speed of the game. You will also see what penalties are being given and a short cinematic of a goal either being scored or missed.The matches could have been made a little more interactive as most of the time you are just watching the time run up. It would be better if there was more control of the team. For example; throughout the match the ability to give commands to players on how aggressive they should be with their attacks. Speeding the match up, just to finish it, is all you would want to do so that you can get back to running the club.After hiring an assistant manager you can give him tasks to do but, the problem here, is that you can’t see what the tasks are because they are all over-lapping each other. The language in the game could use some work too, as every once in a while you will see misspelled words or badly placed grammar.Overall, Big Blaze Games has developed quite an addictive game, even though some of the playability is a bit irritating.Whether you are a casual gamer or a hardcore football fan, this game will keep you playing for hours. Even when you aren’t playing, you will be thinking of ways to improve the club’s standings.			"
