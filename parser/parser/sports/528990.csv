												Actually a good workout and a fun basketball game akin to the arcade hoops games.  Dev should add some kind of money/gold system for when you hit X points to unlock stuff.			"

												As far as gameplay goes, it's just a pretty on rail ball thrower and well I like throwing balls as much as the next guy, especially at a girl who keeps getting in the way of said balls. Is it worth $20, no not really, probably a good one to get on sale.Also for those wondering, if you're fine with a low score, it can indeed be played with one hand.			"

												At $19.99, it's a scam, but I got it during the winter sale at 3.99 worth of monies. Neener, neener, neener! For this reason, and my general taste for chinese vr apps of this ilk, I will not put in a negative rating. They should drop the price though; it's good, and might as well be your vr basketball program of choice, but there's not much there, there. Transboundry!
