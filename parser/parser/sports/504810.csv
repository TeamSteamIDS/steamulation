MXGP2 - The Official Motocross Videogame CompactAttention for everyone, who is going to buy this game!!!Maybe someone is thinking, ""why this game is cheap""?- Because, this isn't the full game. It's just half from full game.MXGP2 - The Official Motocross Videogame is the full game!So, i did same mistake with this game.But, in this game you still have all what u need.- Bikes, tracks and championship/GP			"

												not very good. Charaqcter system is okay but the main flaw is the controlls. You can only use the arrow keys and even then its very sensitive. Also the out of bounds area is to enclosed and its very sudden when you get restarted. I think the effort on the game tho was good. Devs please fix this problem			"

												Loved it , includes single gp and champonship and all the riders / tracks and teams of the 2015 season.Not the full game but provides a cheaper alternative to the full game.Would maybe recommend playing using a controller.
