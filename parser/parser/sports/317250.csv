												The perfect game if you've always wanted to be a tentacle monster. Also if you want an insanely difficult game. Think Super Meat Boy, except gravity can be just about any direction.Might not be great if you get motion sick easily, though. There's a lot of spinning around.			"

												Mixed feelings about this one. It's almost really good, but a few things stop it from shining.I feel like I would have enjoyed the game a lot more if it was a bit easier. The difficulty around the middle of the game was perfect, but the last few levels were just frustrating. I loved Super Meat Boy, and managed to 100% that game, but I really don't want to go through that kind of torture again, especially from a game that looks so cute.There's also a lot of minor bugs in the game, that add up and start to get a bit annoying. In the level with the moving squares of water, the music broke when in the water, and got so distorted that I had to mute my audio. Fireballs sometimes clearly hit me but I don't die. Stuff like that.Rocks really annoyed me. I kept thinking they were part of the background! So many deaths caused by running into rocks.The graphics are also kind of bland. They're passable, but just... not that interesting or appealing.Anyway! The game still has some solid platforming gameplay, and the gravity and swimming mechanics were implemented very well and were surprisingly intuitive. Collecting sea creatures was satisfying, and I got all of them so far in the first 16 zones, minus one. Fans of Super Meat Boy should check this game out, if they want something very similar. Possibly not worth full price, but worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre and it's on sale. "

 About Airscape - The Fall of GravityBeneath the cute visuals of Super Calamari BoyAirscape lies a hard-as-nails platformer (the credits helpfully informed me I died 1663 times in the course of completing it) with interesting level design and a solid amount of diverse content, and it's definitely worth checking out.Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a fast-paced, gravity-shifting action platformer about a deep-sea octopus who has been kidnapped by a mechanical alien race. Control a Dumbo Octopus (Grimpoteuthis abyssicola) on a skybound adventure to save its family from the clutches of the motorized menace. Jump, dodge, and swim through a breathtaking environment full of floating islands, water formations, and robotic terrors. There's no fighting in Airscape - you'll have to rely on your wits, speed, and reflexes to navigate through the deadly gauntlets.  Release Date: 11 Aug, 2015The GameplayYou play as one of five octopi (unlocked through the course of the game), each with a special ability of sorts (one's faster, one's floatier, one can slow time, one can teleport a short distance, and Red... doesn't seem to do anything, as far as I can tell), fighting a mysterious mechanical menace to rescue sea critters. There are usually two or three critters per level, some in convenient locations and some out of the way or requiring a mad dash through the level to reach in time, and unlocks are based on these, which gives a good deal of freedom to pick your levels and avoid some particularly nefarious ones if you so choose (full disclosure: the levels featuring maneuvering in water almost made me give up on it early, but I'm quite glad I stuck it out). The LevelAs the title might indicate, there are some gravitational shenanigans involved - the levels usually take place on essentially tiny planetoids, and the direction that is 'down' will often shift several times over the course of a level (and as many levels have curved ground, often without even thinking about it). It's all part of the level itself, though - the controls are pretty elegantly minimal (up/right/left/shift-for-special-ability). This leaves the levels themselves to hold most of the complexity and they do that well - there are 15 areas in the main game, each with their own style and features, and you end up winding your way through an impressive array of platforms, lasers, cannons, robots, water, acid, homing missiles, mines, and of course the final boss, a force too menacing to be described.All in All  Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is a very nice Indie Game!9/10 From Me Sweep "

What is this game?Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is an action platformer made by Cross-Product, a small team of students from around the world. An octopus is abducted from its homeworld and is forced to save its family and return home while evading countless dangers along the way.What do I do?You control an octopus that is taken away from its homeworld along with its family and must either reach the exit teleporter in each level or rescue an octopus while moving through obstacles, traversing through land with each one having its own gravity and avoiding enemies that may or may not chase and follow you in order to return home. Objects and enemies include lasers, mines, spikes, robots, etc. There are a variety of octopuses (or octopi - take it as you will) to choose from with different unique abilities and with the first being unlocked by default and all subsequent octopuses requiring to be freed.There are additional optional objectives where you can rescue trapped specimens (they are other sea creatures that have been confined as well) and find secret exits to unlock more levels and rescue more specimens.My overall experienceThis game was quite the roller coaster ride from start to finish. It's relaxing at the start but spiked in difficulty towards and at the end. I loved this game at the start, felt frustrated two-thirds of the way through and satisfied in the end. It was a blast.The beginning and tutorial were very welcoming and helped to prepare for the gradual increase in difficulty and complexity in later levels. The next zones added a light challenge and a different atmosphere. It was at halfway through this game when its difficulty began to show, but the soundtrack kept me in and I pushed through all the way to the end where the level of difficulty never went down.What should I expect?Expect an easy and enjoyable experience from the initial part of this game, but don't be surprised when the levels become much more difficult and require good reaction time, precise movement and good decision-making. You will be punished later on for mistiming jumps or making the wrong moves but don't worry about making mistakes, because it's all a matter of trial and error. There only penalty is to be sent back to the last checkpoint reached (or the start of the level if no checkpoints are reached).Things to look forward to:- The start of the game is soothing and enjoyable to play.- Controls are simple and easy to grasp.- Unique physics and gravity mechanics.- The atmosphere and feel of the game is quite comforting and welcoming.- The orchestral soundtrack is excellent and accompanies the levels very well.- Gameplay is smooth at 60 fps and frame rate drops are very rare.- Enemies and obstacles are introduced at a consistent rate and are easy to understand.- There are a good variety of enemies and obstacles, requiring strategic planning to pull through.Things to look out for:- The levels are linear and rarely reward creativity, if not punishing for it.- The rotation when moving around may cause nausea and motion sickness.- Difficulty will spike around the second half of the game and will require precision and timing.- The movement of the octopuses is a little slippery and can cause a lot of deaths (and frustration) especially when the direction of gravity changes suddenly.- Some levels are deprived of important checkpoints and will require a lot of focus (anger doesn't count).- The teleportation ability of the blue octopus does not work when used to move through lasers and can cause suicides.- The slowdown ability of the green octopus is very inconsistent and can ruin specific movement patterns of enemies and obstacles.- The music can become jumbled and buggy when going in water.- There's no way to change the zoom of the camera, reducing awareness and preventing some levels from being traversed properly.Tips:- Adjust the screen rotation rate and shake to what makes you feel the most comfortable (the rotation can get a little crazy and the shaking can be distracting).- Never stick to one particular rate of rotation and keep the orient camera button within reach.- It is not necessary to complete the levels from a to z in order to progress through the game (only rescued specimens are required to progress).- Watch out for a sudden loud noise when rescuing an octopus.Who should buy this game?Players avid about platformers will likely enjoy this game especially with the increase in difficulty during the end-game, but casual players looking for an easy experience may want to avoid this game for the sake of sanity. People who get motion sick and nauseated easily may also want to stay away.Personal commentsI'm not sure why I pushed myself to 100% this game but there's something charming about this particular game that made me want to come back. Maybe it's the soundtrack I absolutely adored or the love-hate relationship with the layout of the later levels or the design choices that were made, but I really enjoyed this game for everything it had to offer. I guess the frustration was worth it in the end.Thanks for readingKevinEdits:Added a 'What is this game?' and 'What should I expect?' section, reworded some sections and made the headings more concise.

												Challenging platforming game with a lovely feel!The variation in design for each of the worlds is great, as is the actual level design.  It's certainly the best take on ""2d Super Mario Galaxy"" that I've seen, and I understand the comparisons to Super Meat Boy.  It absolutely does continue to get harder until the very last few worlds, which all took me quite a while ;).Also, the option for how fast to rotate the screen is a nice touch - I find that having it move faster bothers me less, as it stays more consistent with the orientation of my character.  But if the rotation really bothers you, you'll find out quickly, so you can always ask for a refund.Pros:+ Solid, Unique Platforming Experience+ Charming Style+ Varied Mechanics/Level Design+ Secret/Bonus Levels+ Great Music!!+ A lot of content for the price - took me 10 hours to complete it+/- Don't expect it to be easyCons:- The rotation *might* make you sick- The physics are sometimes a little slippery (you can get momentarily stuck jumping on angled surfaces, and stuff like that)Edit: Changed a couple things since beating it :)			"

												This game is ruthlessly fun. I am inventing new cuss words and reaching a new level of enjoyable anger than I previously thought possible.If you even remotely think you'd enjoy this it is seriously worth the buck. I intended to play a level or two just to try it out and found myself getting sucked into a two hour session.While cutesy in art I consider this to be a solid design that is harder than most. I enjoy this more than I did Battle Block.			"

(Yes you'll die a ♥♥♥♥♥on of times) and because my finger hurt :cBut it's a lovely game it truly is! it's cute and relaxing (at least the first few levels :)) and it's really well made!those are a few reasons you should totally buy this game but honestly the sound the squid makes while walking should be enough :p			"

												Ok so basically you're an octopus living in the sea and then all of a sudden aliens smash into your house and abduct you and all your friends, which happens to us all from time to time, but you somehow managed to escape and now you're on a quest to save your friends. Oh and you also have to save a bunch of other random sea creatures but they're less important. You zoom around each level searching for sea critters and dodging exploding things and laser beams and like, drones and stuff which you'd think for an octopus shouldn't be so hard since scientists are always talking up how smart they and all but it can be VERY challenging at times so prepare yourself you WILL rage during this game. It is fun though and reminds me a lot of Super Mario Galaxy, did anyone else pick up on that whole Super Mario Galaxy vibe?			"

												Usually I try and complete a game before I review, but this is one I won’t be completing this lifetime.There is a BIG DIFFERENCE between CASUAL GAMERS and HARDCORE GAMERS, but interestingly Australian developer Daniel West ( https://twitter.com/JustASquid ) has tried to bring those differences together with this game called Airscape by adding an artistic flair reminiscent of a Nintendo world and combining it with the hard-core difficulty play of super meat boy. The problem with this choice is that those who would REALLY be interested in this game usually dont even give it a second glance because they think it might be for kids. Make no mistake about it. This game makes super meat boy look easy peasy. The best thing though is that there is enough here for casual gamers to be interested. The learning curve is quite well presented in its gradual approach. You know each level is that slightly bit harder, but maybe with enough tries you might be able to master it and this is where the game constantly teases you. ""It's only that little bit harder!"" ""Surely the next save point is just around the corner!""The story is simple. Aliens are sick of abducting steak for dinner, they feel like seafood. Unfortunately you and all your marine buddies weren't fast enough to escape their tractor beam. However while everyone else gets kidnapped, somehow you make your escape in a little glass astronaut helmet and you take it on yourself to traverse the alien landscapes to free your buddies.Each Octopus buddy you unlock has a special skill, from double jump, to dash etc., however to free them you have to have saved enough fish in the first place to warrant saving them from their alien prison containing diabolical traps. Everything wants to kill you on these alien landscapes that's all you need to know. To save most marine creature you'll have to work out quickly how to get to certain areas, or be at a certain place by a certain time or your friends gets kidnapped again.It's easy to pick up, incredibly difficult to master. Eventually if you’re talented enough to unlock all your buddy octopuses then you'll be given a chance to go against a boss. I've only seen 1 person ever complete this level and it took him well over an hr that's how hard it was. He even completed all the levels of the game, but did he save all the fish? Hell no, even he knows how hard this game is to 100%.Below is me playing the first really easy levels and rescuing the first octopus. It gets way harder, but it should be enough of a sample for you. The question is are you up for the challenge? With puzzles that you will mentally have to wrap your suckers around, with enemies that will make you want to ink, with danger that will make you want to squidaddle. How deep in the game can you go?

												Airscape is a playful gravity platformer that feels like an essential buy to any fan of challenging platformers, and is a joy both to play and watch.A demo for Linux, Windows and Mac can be found here.The story starts when you and your group of octopuses are suddenly abducted from your peaceful home inside a water-filled asteroid. You're all lifted up through the sky by a massive tractor beam, but you alone happen to fall off and come crashing down on an unfamiliar planet. Dazed and confused, you have but one thought; to reunite with your friends.Through the first few levels, Airscape is relatively standard platformer fare. You can walk, jump and run, and you have to avoid minor obstacles, like pits and moving enemies. In each level, you'll find a small amount of sea critters held captive in orbs, and your objective is to rescue as many as possible of these and make it to the goal pad. Some of these sea critters are timed challenges, and if you can't make it to them in time, a spacecraft will arrive to take them away. Their locations will still be marked though, so if you see an empty dotted circle, you'll know what you have to do.After making it through the first zone, the space map opens up, and you'll see the next zone of levels, as well as a fortified containment level. From now on you're free to zip through space and select levels as you wish. There are four containment levels in total, and for every one of them you beat, you open up a few more zones on the map, until you've unlocked all 15 and the final boss. Here's where you also get a bit more freedom of choice: Each containment level holds one of your octopus kin captive, and when you release an octopus, it's added to your lineup to choose from at the start of each subsequent level. The different octopuses have their own unique skills, which facilitate different play styles, and it's likely that you'll find a favorite among them. Some can't run, but compensate for their lack of speed through other means. One octopus can slow down time in its near vicinity, and is thus a good choice for when things start getting hectic. There is also a teleporting octopus, which has the ability to zap straight past certain obstacles. It requires a bit of precision though, since it's easy to smash straight into the ground or an enemy, but this octopus seems like a good option once you start learning the ropes.The way gravity works is that there's a pull perpendicular to whichever surface you're closest to. In effect this means that if you're going uphill, the surface will tilt towards you to keep you on a level plane, and if a jump brings you closer to the ground above you, you'll flip around and fall towards that surface. In water, there's no concept of gravity, and you're free to move whichever way you want. There are hotkeys to adjust the screen rotation rate while playing, so it's easy to adjust rotation to a level you find comfortable.One of the game's main strengths, in my opinion, is that there's a ton of variation; not just in enemy types and obstacles, but also in game mechanics and design. The gravity mechanics enable a level design where the ground not only is functional, but also has a curved and visually appealing topography. There are both low and no gravity levels, and even a level with alternating gravity. Enemies range from robotic tanks and aggressive UFOs to sniper rifles, homing missiles, huge showers of meteors, and a bunch more.Each zone have their own orchestral musical themes. I'm especially fond of Eclipse, which has sort of a gothic rock opera feel to it. At least that's what I'm imagining it to be, though I don't have anything to compare it with for reference. You'll find the soundtrack on Bandcamp[samulis.bandcamp.com], where you can give it a free listen before deciding to pay-what-you-want for high-quality downloads. The visuals are colorful and clean, and though there isn't a ton of variation in textures, there's an attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. Like the leaves and cotton balls floating around in the foreground, and plants jiggling a bit when you walk past them. There are also some subtle changes in the expressions of the octopus protagonists, like when their eyes bulge slightly when an enemy is near. Another thing that I found adorable is how when you rescue sea animals, they bob about in a trail behind you throughout the rest of the level.It took me slightly less than 12 hours to rescue enough sea critters to unlock the boss encounter and get through the game. That time also includes finding and completing two hidden levels and well over 2000 deaths and retries. There are more than enough sea creatures to rescue to complete the game, and since difficulty varies between levels and your choice of octopus and player skill, you might find that you'll get through the game faster. The hidden levels can be unlocked by finding a hidden exit in some of the levels, and levels with such exits are marked on the map once you've rescued every animal in them.The game can be played with either a keyboard or a gamepad, and though I prefer keyboard controls, my wired Xbox 360 controller works well both in menus and in-game. Most input buttons can be remapped, and in addition to movement and screen rotation, there's also an input to quickly restart from the last checkpoint. There are a few graphical settings that can be tweaked, but I had no problems running the game at a stable 60FPS on my laptop with Linux Mint 17 KDE and GeForce GT 630M. I did eventually decide to turn a few settings to low, but only because the back- and foreground effects started to give me a hint of motion sickness. By default, the game will try to adjust settings to give you a stable performance, but this can be turned off if you prefer to tune things manually. There's also a timer that can be turned on and will be displayed in the upper left corner, which should be handy for speedrunners.Airscape is unlike anything I've played, and though it looks like a Super Mario Galaxy in 2D, you should expect something closer to Super Meat Boy or Dustforce DX in terms of difficulty. The game has a fair share of checkpoints though, so less experienced players should still be able to get through it with some persistence. I finished the game a week ago, but I'm far from done with it, and have been picking it up for a bit every day since to try to rescue more sea creatures and uncover more secrets.NOTE: This review was originally published on GamingOnLinux[www.gamingonlinux.com].

												Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is an action platformer game about an octopus lost in a strange and dangerous world, where regular laws of gravity simply don’t apply, and it’s sure to attain decent amount of attention from platformer genre fans. This indie title was developed by students from around the world, and its simple premise allows for the focus to be solely on the gameplay, rather than the story of a platformer game that really doesn’t need one.When you hit solid ground for the first time, after a some kind of a movement tutorial,  the feeling is surprisingly familiar. As you may guess, you don't stay there for too long. Soon enough you start floating around and defying the laws of gravity. Your little octopus is able to sprint, run and jump its way around the level, and even backtrack or spin around itself in all possible directions.I often found that many sections of Airscape required a lot more thought than some classic side-scrollers and you really can't rely on any kind of luck when progressing. Everything is thought-out perfectly and it's up to you to step up to the challenge. There sure is alot, and I really mean alot of trial and error in Airscape, so it’s definitely a positive circumstance that level times don’t have an impact on any scoring in the game.There is no score system in Airscape whatsoever, you progress along by means of gathering collectibles and thus unlocking future stages. Here, these take the form of a variety of sea-bound critters held captive by the mysterious glowing, circular machines. Guiding your octopus to the end of each stage is barely even half of the battle, and it’s in freeing these captive sea critters where the real challenge lies.The gravity-based puzzles are extremely interesting, and the original mix of liquid and land plains makes for some snappy button mashing from time to time. Precision is everpresent, that is obvious from the very first level.At some aspects Airscape's inovations really do extend far enough to make it a really great game, although overall floaty style can occasionally make it as frustrating as it is interesting. One thing I really regret is that you can't kill off your enemies by any means. Sure, the game isn't designed in a way that you could directly kill, but at some occasions it would really be a neat touch.Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a amazing example of platformer-puzzler game with a quirky premise and many interesting mechanics. I've personally been waiting for a chgallenge like this since the release of Super Meat Boy, some years ago.Those who stick with it until the end, or should we say – those who are skilled enough to actually finish the game, will definitely be in for a rewarding and different experience.FULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com] "

												It's a simple, easy to learn-hard to master type of platformer with unique elements like gravity shifting. Not one of the best platformers you will ever play but ""meh"".Graphics wise, it appeals to the eye. Even though the screen rotation might make you dizzy sometimes, there is an option to adjust the rate of rotation. I like the user interface generally, and the story presentation.			"

												I think it's safe to say, based on the fact that there is an achievement for ""die 2500 times,"" that this game is a poor execution of ""super meat boy with rotating gravity.""  While the art and music are fine and definitely suit the atmosphere, the touchy controls, water physics that never feel quite right (especially when you start to bob around the water's surface), the constant spinning that you have to keep up with (yes, even when you adjust it to spin slower), and finally the overly difficult scenarios you're plopped into make this game an unenjoyable experience.  In conclusion it feels a lot like BEEP - another platforming game that knew what it wanted to do, and yet when it came down to the level design and how the player moved in the levels, it was clunky and unenjoyable.  I strongly believe that this is the reason why the game failed, not simply because a game's success is ""hit or miss"" as they laughably claim it is in this article: http://www.pcgamer.com/airscape-the-fall-of-gravity-developer-looks-at-why-it-flopped/ "

												I can understand the reason why the screen rotation-rate slider goes from ""Less dizzy"" to ""More snappy""...I don't get seasick easily. But when i stood up after having played this game for the first time, it took quite a few minutes until the sense of balance went back to feeling completely normal againOther than that, the game is a blast! And the orchestral music is just amazing!So, be warned if you are very prone to getting motionsickness, have a neck-injury, (or playing it when hungover)...(EDIT: For me, It actually felt less ""dizzying"" just putting rotation-rate to maximum)			"

												Good: *Challenging  - Reminiscent of Super Meat Boy, though somehow not as rewarding. Controls are tight; most, if not all, deaths are your fault.*Clever Level Designs - Some levels felt phoned in, but MANY took advantage of the game's cool gravity mechanic. Not to mention, the different worlds vary in atmosphere greatly, which is very nice.*Adjustable motion rotation for camera - I turned mine up all the way, and only a couple of moments made me dizzy. The option is still there to turn it down if you are susceptible to motion sickness.*Ambience - Music and graphics fit well together. They don't bring the game down.*Sale price - So cheap. Definitely worth $0.49. I'd have paid full price if I knew I'd enjoy it as much as I do (still only $5). Bad:*Exhausting - Being challenging can be a bad quality, too. I've been able to play 3 sessions, a half hour each. There's a reason most reviews you see for this game are 3 hours or fewer. Every moment requires your full attention and hard concentration. Not the kind of game to spend an afternoon on, or to play while watching a movie or TV show on Netflix.If you like platformers, there's no reason you shouldn't try this one out.			"

												Do not let yourself be fooled by the cutesy graphics and the screenshots - this is a properly difficult game.A platformer by nature, you play as an octopus on a mission to rescue your friends. You will traverse many worlds, each with its own unique layout and challenges. The game starts off gently, slowly easing you in and helping you to grasp the mechanics and controls. However, things quickly begin to ramp up and you will find yourself tested. Be warned - you will die many, many times before reaching the end. There is an astonishing amount of content for such a low price. Added to which, the controls and mechanics are fantastic - if you die, you will know that it was your own fault. The graphics and music are also a perfect fit for the game itself, and the worlds are wonderfully designed and thought out.A word of caution - some people get motion sickness from the screen rotation. It can be adjusted, but may not alleviate it for those prone to such things.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys platformers, or for anyone looking for a proper challenge. You will not be disappointed.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.			"

												This game starts out as a fun platformer, with tight controls, a good level design and mechanics, but it soon derails into a sadistic and  frustrating sequence of really bad and unforgiving level design, that makes it feel like it's dumb luck when you finally can get past some of it's obstacles course. Take a look at it's global achievements page and you'll see how it unnaturally drops right after the third achievement, which is how far you can get after about one hour of play. And after playing I understand why, as it's where the level design starts its sadistic and frustrating trend.It has it's moments, but I can't really recommend it.			"

												A cute platformer with interesting environments even though it can be kind of janky at times.The game is not visually complex but the environments are a lot more varied than I expected for an indie game, each of the 15 normal worlds has its own visual style, and they all look pretty nice.The gravity shifting is mostly used to make linear levels coil around themselves which makes for pretty cool visual effects, but straightforward platforming. There are 1 to 3 optional collectables per level, never too far from the main path. A handful of these collectables are time restricted and require you to speedrun the level with a not too strict time limit.Some movement quirks take a bit of practice to get used to, notably the way jumping out of water works (the incline of the water surface against gravity determines how much of your momentum you get to keep) and the fact that whenever gravity changes your controls also change instantly, before the camera can even catch up.The difficulty curve is fairly smooth and the game isn't terribly difficult if you're used to the genre. For reference I'm (probably) the target audience for this kind of game and I beat it entirely in around 7 hours according to Steam. Actually challenging levels start to appear about 2/3 through when some enemies ripped straight from N+ show up.There are a few mostly inconsequential bugs; if you die in water sometimes the music stays muffled when you respawn and fixes itself next time you jump out of water. The very last secret level also has plenty of visual glitches whenever you respawn which may or may not fix themselves when you progress to the next section of the level.Overall I'd recommend this game to people interested in the genre.

 This game was reviewed with a key from evolve.pr via the developer Summary: For the platformer player who wants variety. The cute artstyle and peaceful music overlook a game that's actually reasonably difficult at its core. Variety is the name of the game here and levels don't repeat mechanics very often or reuse it in new and various ways, and you won't get bored with any specific mechanic or different character that you unlock. The game has some design issues in particular with the aesthetic and setting up the player for failure with some of its level design and the wrong use of color in certain action situations. It's going to wear on certain players of the genre, and there's nothing horribly unique about the game to make it stand out, but it's definitely solid in most aspects, and I did have fun even if I kept on dying at parts repeatedly. Also, be weary if you get motion sick. Even though there's options to deal with that in game, I do think it brings a worse experience in the end.  Gameplay Footage and Video Review:

 Lists: +: Strong variety in mechanics, as you'll be challenged by different platforming elements that don't twist the game into a pretzel, but do enough to make the game feel different from zone to zone.  Like the different play styles and taking advantage of the different small differences in each of the characters. Music is a strong relaxing soundtrack with appropriate action sections that give a feeling like Super Mario Galaxy's music would. Very appropriate to the gameplay.  Cute artwork, definitely get attached to the different octopi due to the artstyle and child like nature. Will provide a challenge for those who want it. -: Some of the level design goes against good platforming conventions with ideas of forced deaths (having to learn of vital information with a forced death). Can lead to frustration. Not really sure of the rotation camera mechanic and why it's so changeable in the end. Higher resolution of camera movement would have made a lot more sense. It's in a crowded field right now, and honestly it doesn't do anything really strongly to stand out in any one area, which can be a problem. It's mostly solid: but that doesn't necessarily bode well with the competition it's against.  Inconsistent in the challenge curve. Fluxates strongly in several areas, as opposed to a reasonable progression.  "

												Beneath the cute visuals of Super Calamari BoyAirscape lies a hard-as-nails platformer (the credits helpfully informed me I died 1663 times in the course of completing it) with interesting level design and a solid amount of diverse content, and it's definitely worth checking out.You play as one of five octopi (unlocked through the course of the game), each with a special ability of sorts (one's faster, one's floatier, one can slow time, one can teleport a short distance, and Red... doesn't seem to do anything, as far as I can tell), fighting a mysterious mechanical menace to rescue sea critters. There are usually two or three critters per level, some in convenient locations and some out of the way or requiring a mad dash through the level to reach in time, and unlocks are based on these, which gives a good deal of freedom to pick your levels and avoid some particularly nefarious ones if you so choose (full disclosure: the levels featuring maneuvering in water almost made me give up on it early, but I'm quite glad I stuck it out).As the title might indicate, there are some gravitational shenanigans involved - the levels usually take place on essentially tiny planetoids, and the direction that is 'down' will often shift several times over the course of a level (and as many levels have curved ground, often without even thinking about it). It's all part of the level itself, though - the controls are pretty elegantly minimal (up/right/left/shift-for-special-ability). This leaves the levels themselves to hold most of the complexity and they do that well - there are 15 areas in the main game, each with their own style and features, and you end up winding your way through an impressive array of platforms, lasers, cannons, robots, water, acid, homing missiles, mines, and of course the final boss, a force too menacing to be described.It's a great game. If you're looking for a platformer that's reasonably challenging - but not unreasonably challenging - look no further.(Side note: I got the 'complete the game in under an hour' achievement despite my playtime on the save file being around five hours, so don't be put off by that - it's probably summing the actual level completion times.)

												Controls are way too slippery to enjoy in addition to changing the rules all the time. The game tries it's absolute best to work with a screen that's can rotate full circle which in it's own sense is creative but fails to execute it nicely. It goes to show that not all ideas are a good one. I appreciate that it's something different for platformers but it's so confusing that it just isn't fair for the player in the end. There's no indication whatsoever as to where your character is oriented on land when you're in water. Once you leave the body of water you're character is re-oriented to land on whichever land you're nearest to which is impossible to figure out and confusing as hell especially in the later stages. Leaving a body of water can mean turning your character upside down, right, or left without any indication of doing so usually leading to your death because you're unable to know where your character will land when you leave said body.tl;dr: good concept, horrible execution. Not sure how this made it onto steam sigh			"

												I love the game, it's cute and is really unique. What I don't love is how tedious, annoying, and in general a little buggy it can be. I'll just quickly list a few things about it:- The art style is cute and funny, perfect for young children.- Extremely mild violence, so again, perfect for young children if that's what you're looking for.- The camera movement is horrible, why anyone would want to increase it is beyond me. I personally didn't get nauseous or feel affected by it, but it can for other people, especially anyone with motion sickness.- The camera will zoom in on you when jumping, making it difficult to tell if you've underestimated it, over-jumped, or are going to land it. It also makes it difficult to see anything coming.- The movement is wacky and difficult to use in water. You use the right and left arrow keys to direct yourself and the up and down arrow keys to propel yourself. This is difficult in parts that require finesse and precise movements to avoid mines or anything else closely put together as your character propels itself too far forward in most cases.- The checkpoints are far too sparse to make it enjoyable, it feels more like a chore to complete the level when you continuously die due to reduced vision radius or anything else, then have to start back from the checkpoint.- I meet the recommended requirements and yet I continue to lag even with nothing else open and settings lowered. Complete bullsh*t that I should have to even lower the settings, I set the water to low and it's textureless. I set the sky to low or medium and it's bland. I set the resolution to anything below 1280x[...] and it's blurry as all hell.- The music will begin to glitch and sometimes even cut out altogether. Otherwise there's constant static which you can't do anything about.Don't get me wrong, it's great to play, but it take far to long to complete a level and feels like I'm at work, not playing a video game. In general it's just too tedious and get's repetitive fast. If you're into that though, by all means buy it, it's worth the money. Otherwise, keep it and spend it on something else you'll enjoy.

												Bought this in a $2 bundle, so I guess I paid about $.35 cents for it. I don't actually like most platformers, but this one's cute, and the gameplay's fairly innovative. You play as an octopus-thing who rescues ""critters"" suspended in the air, and you reach them by alternately running along the ground and swimming through water. There's no real ""up"", as the gravity changes from area to area. It doesn't take long to get used to, though, and the controls work pretty well (which is important, given how many things in this pretty little world are trying to kill you). I personally wouldn't pay full price for it, but if you really like platformers, this is a good one. If it's on sale and looks like the sort of game you might enjoy, go ahead and give it a try.			"

												I'll be brief.The jumping is fine, the ""gravity"" mechanic is fine.Lasers, mines and  bullets are pretty standard and they work ok within the game.The art is cute and consistent.What's not fine is the close-up camera that doesn't let you see where you're going/landing most of the time.The sparse and arbitrary checkpoints are also quite frustrating when you can't even see death coming until the last second.The imprecise fans that blow you upwards are not fine. The water control are definitely not fine: the analog rotates you and the jump button propels you forward. Avoiding lasers, mines and chasers with these controls is extremely awkward, and they make up a considerable portion of the game from a certain point onwards.The game suffers from a few key design flaws that made me hate it as soon as stages started getting tough.The approach seems to strongly favor trial and error rather than skill and reflexes.I advise against purchasing this game.

												Now, This may sound like a biased review since some people know I know the developer of this game in real life... (Grew up together).I remember when he first told me he was creating this game for steam... It used to be a HTML 5 game that he made about 3 years back using Construct 2. I remember being in awe at the complexity of the game and how freaking awesome it was with the mechanics! I was so excited for him (And I still am now) I never thought he would legetimately make it to the steam store but as always, he has blown me away with this incredible game!If you like games like Super Meat Boy... Be prepared for a whole new world to punch your monitor over!!! I had the pleasure of bug testing this game before it's release and I was able to play the game during it's alpha stages as well. The game was so much fun at all stages of it's creation and kept me wanting more! - Fast paced? {Check}- Frustrating? {Check}- Awesome eye popping indie graphics? {Check}- Awesome music? {Check}- Wish you had more time to play for hours on end? {Check}- Amazing use of game mechanics? {Check}- Kawaii main characters? {Check}I could go on and on with that list but hey! Find out for yourself! I mean, 10 bucks is cheap for this game... I would pay more for it!The only negative... I broke a key on my keayboard during gameplay...

												Holy spinning cameras Squidman! Airscape is a game that gives the finger to all things oriented and flips all the platformers you love upside down and squirts ink in their face. Things seem simple at first as you and your octopi family are seemingly abducted and dropped into some sort of floating islands. Things start off casually enough for any beginner platformer and then suddenly everything gets flipped on its head. Pun intended. What makes Airscape good is that the difficulty ramps up significantly and challenges you in unique ways that play with the idea of gravity and momentum. The level design is superb and this shows in the 60+ levels. On top of that the controls are tight and responsive, if you mess up, it's your fault. Slap on the adorable art style, orchestral soundtrack, six different playable characters and suddenly Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is one of the best platformers to come out in 2015.(Thus far.) However one thing to keep in mind is that this game does cause quite a bit of motion sickness. It simply just spins and spins ALOT. If you are easily affected by visuals consider this a WARNING. It's a fun, great game but the games core mechanics cause nausea. EDIT: So sadly, after the last patch my entire progress was reset. Not a huge problem but a little upsetting.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is an action platform game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to play fullscreen or windowed mode.There are many resolution sizes available.There is Music volume slidebar available with a %.There is a sound volume slidebar available with a %.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to play with a controller.There are 3 different save slots available.There is a small tutorial available.About the game.You are playing with some Squid on some Airscapes or asteroid things. You have to jump and flip the gravity whenever you are moving to a different rock. If you have played ""Super mario Galaxy"", then you could compare it with this. There are collectable in each level and they are needed to move on to a new section. There are bars/lines in the bottom of the screen. This should be seen as a collectable counter.  There are different themes and worlds with their own playstyle. There are checkpoints throughout the levels. Whenever you do die, you will respawn back at the checkpoint but will lose all of the progress that u have made until the last touch to the checkpoint. So if you have 2 collectables, but you touch the checkpoint whenever you had only 1 collectable without a renewing. Then you will respawn back with 1 collectable. Some of the collectables do have a timer. If you are too late, You will be forced to restart the entire level. You have to save your other squid friends and you will be be able to play with them after completing the level.Calming Game.Calming Music. Each level has collectables.Sidewards screen rotation.Different squids has different ""effects""Has collectable counter in each level.Different world themes.It is a kid's friendly game.However the screen rotation COULD be a bugger for them.You are able to reduce the screen rotation including turning it off.There is a world map available where you are able to see the collectable progress and select your level.Some of the collectables are time based.Other things.If you are familiar with the Yoshi island ""Moon Raven"" Boss, That you are fighting him on the yellow moon. The screen also get sidewards rotated. This game is almost the same like that.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Excellent platformer indie game!To say it simply: imagine an indie game taking a bit of Super Meatboy, Ecco 2, and Rayman 1. Make it a bit more amateurish and unpolished, but preserve the hard core gameplay, the dreamy art design, the multi ways platform style... oh, and give it a very forgettable title: you got Airscape.The gameplay is a bit clumsy, the graphic design is a tad amateurish, the music is unfortunately casual, but all these weaknesses are nothing compared to the feeling that Airscape provides you gaming-wise. Indeed: you may start the first few levels, wondering what you can expect more from that kiddish game. Then the difficulty will rise up and rise up, and if you ARE a REAL gamer, you will KEEP on pressing RESTART even after your HUNDREDTH death just because you want to finish that DARN level! So: a very smart level design.Plus, there are Items to gather, Characters to unlock, Secret Levels to find, almost no bug whatsoever so far, and a real and authentic effort in the overall structure and graphics of that game. That is a lot of old-school way (I did not say retro) of thinking there, which is really satisfactory. All in all: if you can forgive this indie game's weaknesses and clumsiness, you may enjoy a real play time. I have more than 15 hours in that game already and I'm only at 75% I would say.Now I will look forward to what this developing studio is up to in the future because there is some real honest quality game here! I do recommend!Note 1: I played this game like many of my platformers, with the keyboard, and it works great! No idea how the controller gameplay feels.Note 2: Beware, the gravity/camera rotates a lot, so you may feel sick, depending on people (I am fine, my wife gets sick)			"

												tl;dr For the part of the game I've played, I'd recommend buying this on >50% sale.Amount played: the first seven or eight ""zones"", each of which has a few levels in it.Pros:  * Rotating gravity is a fun mechanic, and it's not beaten to death as a gimmick  * Art is well done. Cute but not trying too hard.  * Options to tone down (or disable) camera rotation for people who get motion sickness  * Each zone has a theme (beaches, caves, poison clouds, moon, etc.)  * You unlock different characters with slightly different attributes (movement speed, ability to float, ability to ""warp dash"")  * Great checkpoint placement - I've never felt screwed by the lack of a checkpoint  * Somebody put thought & care into the level design. It's not Portal-tier design, but definitely pretty good.  * Optional speedrun incentive: some levels have gems that can only be collected for a limited time.Cons:  * Movement controls take some getting used to. They're very predictable, but you need do need to be ready to learn to compensate for momentum to avoid running into everything, especially in water levels.  * There's a maximum camera rotation speed, and a few levels require you to think quickly while your character is rotation faster than the camera.  * Movement controls are relative to the character and not to the camera  * Some levels have fans in them. Imo fans are incredibly frustrating to work with: sometimes I'm blasted into the air, sometimes I hover. I have no ability to predict how I will move from how I approach the fan. It's a frustrating mess on its own, and even worse when combined with other obstacles. I get through those areas just by trying a thousand times.  * My current ""♥♥♥♥ this I'm out"" zone has guns that will track you and insta-kill you if you don't move out of their line of sight within ~half a second. They demand a new tier of split-second timing and movement precision that, in my opinion, this game isn't built for.			"

												Starting zone 3 this game gets insanely hard. Got it dirt cheap, enjoyed a bit, collected cards, fine with me.  I'd like to tell the devs - if you think people would enjoy dying 2500 times to complete a game, you are quite wrong.			"

												Its verry cheap and but not verry fun. The platforming concept is quite different... but unfortunatly not in a good way. The camera is going al over the place. Even if you turn the camera rotation to the lowest setting is gets annoying quite vast. Warning for people who easely get motion sick: Dont buy this game! No really dont you will puke. For me the game lost all its charm after 10 minutes or so, its just not intresting enough to keep jou playing and the camera is just way to annoying.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game.Levels quickly ramp up in difficulty. Camera is zoomed in close on most levels so it was frustrating to know where to go (if there was way to zoom out, I couldn't figure it out). Throw in a large amounts of overlapping, player killing obstacles that the only way to learn the path through is to die, die, and die again while struggling with controls that feel sloppy. With progress being stopped cold a number of times, while trying to get past a hazard choke point 50+ times, I lost interest in continuing.To sum up, it's not an easy game, and it isn't really any fun.

												Had lots of fun with this one!Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is an excellent game about some different coloured octopi that try to save their sea critter friends at the same time as fighting off a robot alien invasion. By saving their friends. Platforming is excellent in this game, as well as a little bit of difficulty that should keep you playing for a while, however, it could be a bit longer.Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is a colourful and cute indie-platformer that will keep you playing for long enough.

												Really fun and difficult platformer with 5 different playable octopi each with unique abilities that help them get around obsticles in the wide variety of levels. Pros:Platforming is smooth.Each playable character has a different and unqiue ability.Many different levels and puzzles to solve.Plays well with a controller (unlike some other PC platformers).Extremely cute artstyle.Cons: Some puzzles have no hint of what you should do.Some levels are just plain rage inducing. (I'm looking at you first stronghold level)Save points are sometimes few and far between.overall I would give the game an 8.5/10.(I know, I'm only about half way through the game but eh, I just wanted to reveiw it as the game follows the same formula) "

												Before I start my review, I'd just like to say how adorable this game is. Honestly I only bought it because it looked cute. The GraphicsAs I normally start all of my reviews, I have to look at the graphics first. Graphics are usually one of the first things people look for when choosing a new game to dive into. Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is a beautiful 2D-ish platformer. When I first picked up this game I honestly didn't expect much, especially for the $.50 that I paid for it. (Yes, I paid for it, but steam says I got it for free, so whatever.) But like always, I was mistaken. This game is beautiful, simply stunning for what it is. The edges are sharp, the visuals are pleasing and the art style keeps me coming back for more. I couldn't really ask for much more when it comes to a game such as this one, let's move on. GameplayThis is where I was extremely caught off guard, this game takes advantage of some insane physics, I highly recommend turning your rotation down when you start playing, because motion sickness is definitely possible when playing this game for too long. The controls are very simple, up (jump) left and right, and shift to run/sprint. However, that doesn't mean this game is easy. There's many achievements for dying in this game, in fact at the very end of the story it will tell you how many deaths you had in your play through. It seems that around 1500-2000 is the normal amount for this game, but don't let that stop you. It's a hell of a lot of fun to play. Story This game has a simple story, but beware there are spoilers ahead. If you haven't started this game, you may want to skip this section. So, in the beginning you find a group of other creatures, after swimming with them, you, and your new friends get captured and you have to find them. This game has a very simple story, beat level, play next level, advance. Rinse, wash, repeat. But, it is fun. I haven't personally gotten far in this game as of the time of this review, but I definitely will finish this game in the near future. SummaryAll in all, this is a very well rounded platformer, with a gorgeous are style and an absolute load of gameplay to go with it. It's cute, it's fun, and you'll like it. Buy it for the price, play it for the experience.			"

												Airscape - The Fall of Gravity Review - Raymond KTI heard this was inspired by Super Mario Galaxy, and i did see the resemblence. It was on sale and i seen my opportunity. I think the biggest issue with this game is that it just doesnt look good in screen shots. The character is bland and the levels arent interesting looking unless they are spinning. The aesthetic looks like a default setting in unity. Platformers are a dime a dozen and you are going to have to really do something different. I have played free ios platformers with more depth, design, and gameplay innovation. So i really dont understand why this guy is mad, he made a cheap looking and playing game and priced it at 10 bucks and thinks that the consumer is the problem? I wish them well on their next game, but this was NEVER going to work and its not steam's fault, its not the consumer's fault. It's the game, it just isnt that good.			"

												[I was given this game for free as part of a influencer promotion]Free Games Promoter gave me a copy of this game to play, its a styelised cutesy platformer as you can see from the screenshots where you can jump up cielings that then become the new floor. Falling off things is certainly possible though because the gravity does not change until you landed safely.Upon launch the game was very nausiating to me although i must admit that i was very tired that day. It looks like the developers know that the constant screenspinning can be an issue since a few levels in the game prompted me to scale the rotation speed down to suit me needs. After this the complaint was solved. The game runs stable on my system and i did not experiance any issues beyond that initial nausia.I am not that big in to platformers due to playing to many terrible ones on flash sites i tend to get bored of them quickly. This game did not stand out for me from some of the better ones on the sites, but for 0,19 cents it is a no brainer for anyone who wants to get a quick platforming fix. As a result i didn't end up playing the game for very long, but if you are in to platformer it is probably well worth your $0,19.			"

In Airscape, you play as an adorable Octopus creature. Levels have a lot of gravity based puzzles. You can jump from floor to ceiling, and rotate around small bits of land. It's pretty fun, especially in later levels when gravity is also used in traps and enemies.To unlock the next chapter, you have to save ""critters"" within each level. Most are just hidden collectibles, but occasionally you will have a timer that starts when you begin a level, in order to save them. It's not hard to collect enough, and if you feel frustrated with collecting some, you can simply complete the level without saving any critters, or skip to the next level.As you play the game, you'll save some octopus friends with different new abilities, which adds further freshness to the game.It's a very simple game, with easy to understand mechanics, although levels later on do provide a challenge for people looking for something a bit harder. It's a great game overall!			"

												Disclaimer: I received this game for free.I played through the first world and a little bit  of the second on my first run-through. I recommend this platformer because of its unique yet forgiving control scheme. It has a fun dynamic gravity feel and the controls are somehow immediately intuitive even though the camera is always doing weird things.It's not a particularly hard platformer but it does have some hurdles that will make you feel accomplished. I really dislike the platformers that seem to be nothing more than trial and error as you slowly uncover the exact button press sequence the developers had in mind. This isn't like that.  There's an open world feel in the levels and enough margin of error in dodiging and such that you don't feel like you have to be 100% perfect to progress.Overall I would say this is fun yet casual platformer based in a unique world. I'd certainly recommend at a sale price ($1-2), and would recommend it at full price ($5) if you were really into the genre. "

												Great game, weird pacing and theme:This game is very good and challenging but not engageing enough to become popular, interesting gamplay and good graphics are often not enough to capture people's attention for long.I feel like the pacing is wrong in some of the levels, they tend to get so big and you can only see a small part. The checkpoint placement sometimes makes you repeat large segments many times, this induces some form of fatigue.Another aspect in my oppinion is the visual theme, I feel like no one really cares about an octopus (a yellow blob really) with a fish tank in its head, its not eyecatching, same goes for the enemies.In general this is a very good game so I'll try to play it more, but ultimately cant see many people playing more that 2 hours.

												TLDR; The game's alright and cheap so get it if you're bored.I'm honestly pretty mixed about this game. The gameplay has several moments of fair and interesting challenges which can entice any average platformer fan. However, this quickly disappears as the levels begin to throw in unnecessary and often frustrating moments of difficulty.One partculiar case involves several missiles that are off screen whilst your character must navigate on a slippery surface and dodge several annoying robots. Another level contains fireballs that blanket the ENTIRE screen and randomly curve mid- air. The game too quickly spikes up the diffculty curb.Additionally, the unlockable characters are often useless in comparison to the original orange octopus for the simple fact that THEY CAN'T DUCKING RUN. It is also of unfortunate note that you can't switch characters mid level without returning to the start (and not dying). For levels that often involve speed and momentum, this can be frustrating for many players.The graphics and sound track are nothing special but are quite passable (hey at least the octopi are cute).Overall, however, the game has certain enjoyable moments with some flaws that can be worked out and I would like to see the developers' work in the future.

												There needs a better introduction to the game mechanics. The game doesnt leave you enough time to learn the execution prowess the levels want you to have. Here are my recomendations to improve it:-An easier start. I found that those levels would be great ""mini-bosses"". The 1st zone works well, but the 2nd zone introduces too many mechanics. I found the item kidnap the most unfair, taking into account the trial an error the game demands.-Make the game less demanding. Requiring the finesse in every level ended up tiring me a lot, adding easier levels between the hard ones, would be a lot less tiring.Overall, I found everything I've seen beatiful but the level desing makes the game really hard to play.

												Brought this game for £0.15 when it was on sale, an amazing purchase to say the least. The artwork and physics of the game are amazing for it's price and should cost more. If you are looking for a game to just sit down, listen to music and chill then this is the one. You may be asking what is the game about? You are a squid kidnapped by a ""mechanical alien race"" set to save your friends in a 2D side scroller action packed adventure. If Super Mario Galaxy was 2 dimensional then this would be it, also some of the features remind me of Yoshi's Island like how the fish follow you around when collecting the glowing orbs. £1.99 is a great purchase for 60 levels and a few hours of fun.Some infomation -Runs on low end devices / Single player / Cartoon GraphicsOverall I would rate this game a 8/10 - January, 2017			"

												Airscape - The Fall Of Gravity is a solid platformer, with blood of the old die-&-retry games of our childhood running in its veins (and you're going to die a lot, trust me my friend...).The visuals are very appealing to the eye and the little squid is so cute ! There's also enough variety in the environments to keep you entertained.The water and gravity shifting adds a modern touch to the plateform compared to oldies, and additionnal challenge, but it can make your head spin.It's not particularly fantastic, but it's a good skill-based game and it's so cheap you should get it right now.

												One of the neatest strategy games I have ever played. It is a gauntlet for a little octopus who is just trying to save his friends and return home. Not a relaxing game and causes frustration when you can get all but 1 of the critters needed to complete the level. If you do not pass the checkpoint and you die you need to start over again and some levels can be quite tricky and tedious. 7/10 for quality 5/10 for controls and maneuvering , 9/10 concept. 8/10 graphics and soundtrack. It is very simple but well done. Very adorable overall!			"

												I got this game for 0.19 euro, when I got it I thought it was going to be crap, and I was pleasantly suprised. The graphics look good, The gameplay is awesome , the controlls feel kinda sloppy but as a guy who has used construct 2 I know there isnt that much to do about it. I would give it 8/10. It is worth the money.			"

												Airscape has to be one of the most difficult, EASY games I have ever played. You start, and you are like, "" THIS IS EASY!"" ""This will be a walk in the park."" ""I feel like something is strange.""THIS GAME WILL MINDMELT YOU. Get ready for anger. Get ready for UNFAIR, yet perfectly EASY gameplay. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AS YOU PLAY.I SUGGEST YOU GET RUBBER FOR YOUR MOUTH, IF YOU DON'T, YOU WILL BITE OFF YOUR TONGUE IN FRUSTRATION.I have to say that I DO, in fact, LOVE the way this game is presented. I actually beat the game without dying OVER 2500 times, but that being said, I did die 2387 times before I 101%ed the game. <-- ACHIEVEMENTPROS:Octopus are adorable.You get to help them.You fall in love with the sounds.CONS:The sound in this game crashes if you die over ~100 times in a single level.Difficulty, IT IS A MIX OF A PRO AND CON.Simplicity. The simplicity makes this game ♥♥♥♥ you off. I love the simplicity, but it is so simple that it is hard. lolI HEAVILY SUGGEST THIS GAME, AND I WANT TO TELL THE CREATORS THEY ARE GREAT.Sidenote to creators, I know the last level is glitchy because of how much is on the screen, but there should be a way to make it work a little better.PERFECT GAME!

												Not gonna lie, I was surprised by this one, I think I got it in a humble bundle or something and I originally had no intention of playing it but I'm glad I did, the game is fun, decent to look at and really, deserves a little more attention. The gameplay is fast but also challenging if you aren't careful. My only gripe with the game really after 6 hours is, the water. The graphic for the water bothers me for some reason. Otherwise, great game!			"

I haven't finished the game yet, but I can recommend it from what I've seen so far.  An award-winning game with 90% approval from players deserve a whole lot more sales, and I hope it gets them.I saw Airscape at the PAX Aus indie showcase, and was reminded about the game when I read the article on gamasutra saying that not many people had played the game, so I bought it.  Also, I'm grateful that you support Linux, that's always a good sign!http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DanielWest/20150908/253040/Good_isnt_good_enough__releasing_an_indie_game_in_2015.php "

												A platformer that sports colorful graphics, decent music, solid level design, and Steam trading cards that cover the price of the game. Unfortunately, it also contains a difficulty curve that ramps up too quickly as well as an extremely disorienting camera due to the gravity mechanic. I don't ever get motion-sickness from playing games, but this one was an exception.Overall, it's fun for an hour or so, though I didn't have it in me to complete it due to its flaws. If you can get past them, you should definitely buy this game.			"

												I sincerely ask you to imagine a stunning panaroma of vistas scattered throughout deep space: caves with luminescent flora, poisonous green streams, and woody plains shrouded in a perpetual night. The awe and mystery of it all is further enhanced by the fact that its spread across small planetoids and floating water tunnels that create this sense of a magnificient, interlinked series of little ecosystems just begging to be explored. You walk out... and are greeted with the sharp, startling noise of gunshot as an auto-targeting turret blasts your insides into several pieces.I'll readily admit that I'm not one of those ""Super Meat Boy"" type gamers. If that's your thing, Airscape may just be your next itch scratcher. Believe me, it gets hard... quick. But even acknowledging my own tastes, I find it hard not to look at this and feel disappointed.Because shoot, this game looks and sounds absolutely beautiful. The orchestrated score is just wonderful and it complements the gorgeous vistas you'll visit throughout this game. The game feels like a cross between an adventure game and action platformer as you zig-zag between planetoids and navigate winding rivers of floating water. It controls well enough as well; when moving in and out of water, controlling your player's orientation can be annoying, but ultimately that's the only major control complaint I have. At face value, there's this game I just want to get lost in and take in the wonder and danger of it all.The problem is that the danger quickly eclipses the wonder in a major way. Make no mistake, this game is teeming with wonderful ideas and creative set pieces to throw you into, and throw you in it does. You're flung straight into these deceptively pretty hotbeds of death with little to no introduction. Yes, levels are short so death isn't always costly from a gameplay perspective, but that's not my main complaint here. Its just that the game does such a good job of stimulating the senses that all these one-shot deaths can just shatter the immersion. Those turrets I mentioned earlier? When I encountered them in their level group, I quickly lost my desire to explore that cluster of planetoids. They were such a jarring part of the encounter that it blew my excitement clean away.In conclusion, Airscape just feels like a game with something akin to an identity crisis. I'm certainly not against messing with player expectations or trying a ""bait-and-switch."" But for me personally, the ""switch"" was so frequent and polarizing between beautiful and vicious that it sucked the air straight out of my sails. If you're up for the challenge, by all means go for it, but I find it hard to recommend this game when you consider the sum of all its parts.			"

												Airscape is NOT the kind of game I normally play, as I have not been a major platformer guy. That said, something about the mix of art-style and music grabbed me. Certainly the the world going all 360 on you will be a big attention grabber for many but for me it was the simple, well 'charm' of the game. It is very challenging but fun and it certainly doesn't take itself seriously.  To both fans of 'platformers' and those that aren't I can say this title is certainly worth a look. I recommend it, now get out there and rescue some fish, oct-pod-like creatures!  :)   Enjoy!   - Mal** There is a gamepad option and frankly might make you life a bit easier, I managed 'ok' with the keyboard!I did put out a brief video overview, for those of you that are inclined:

												Super Mario Galaxy meets Trials meets Mega Man with Octupi?  Sign me up!This is a SUPER challenging platformer with a ton of interesting mechanics.  The feel and movement is very polished and once you get used to the screen rotation (the sensitivity of which can be changed at the press of a button) it can become very satisfying.  Gets you into that old school psychological flow state and once you're there you don't want to leave.  Plenty of different environmental features, enemies and challenges with harsh but fair checkpointing keeps you pushing forwads.			"

												I found it quite disorenting and caused me to feel quite motion sick. It's cute an' all but the controls are incredibly awkward when you turn off the screen rotation to reduce the nausia. Pressing the ctrl key to change the rotation didn't work either, when that happened, it just made me feel even more nausious. I do however recommend this game if you don't get rediculously ill from it. Wish there was an option to press Yes and No... < - <			"

I moderately enjoyed my time with Airscape: The Fall of Gravity. It started out as a strong, fun platformer that reminded me of Super Mario Galaxy. Then it turned into a game that was even more frustrating than Squirreltopia for me. I regularly play ""hardcore indie platform"" games, but the later levels were just beyond frustrating for a few reasons. First, it would be simple platform parts for about the first 40 seconds of the level, then after doing that 40 seconds of precision, but simple platforming, you get to the actual 'hard' platforming which ammounts to several environmental affects/enemies happening at once or an offscreen kill. Then the game ceased to be fun. Overall, great concept and execution, but lacking a bit in making levels fun, fair, and still challenging. Green squid levels are the worst since they literally drag on and on. I eventually just beat them all with purple. My video review of Airscape is above.			"

												Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a decent but unexceptional 2D platformer game. You play as an octopus in a space helmet, sucked out of your ocean and cast off into space for… no apparent reason, honestly (the game has no real plot, and the villain of the game has no clear motivation). Your goal is to navigate through the levels, freeing various sea critters and ultimately, the other octopi who were kidnapped with you, all on the way to defeat the final boss.This is one of those games which plays heavily with gravity. Gravity orients itself straight downward, including on curved slopes, meaning you can walk along a curved surface without ever having to jump or break your stride, similar to walking around a 3D planet with gravity. However, most platforming sections do only allow one orientation of landing on the platforms, so only select surfaces (marked by grass and similar things) are actually “walkable”.The game has a fairly simple set of mechanics – you can walk, you can jump, and you can, depending on your particular octopus, do one of several other things (run faster, float, teleport, slow down time, or double jump). As with many such games, the complexity comes almost entirely from the levels, wherein you must contend with twisted gravity, gravity reversals, attacks from missile turrets and moving lasers, bottomless pits, water (which always reorients your gravity according to the direction you’re facing, though you float in it so it doesn’t really matter), poisonous water you can’t spend too much time in without dying, and a very small number of invincible enemy types (no enemies in the game can be beaten). There are switches which are used to open gates and at times reverse gravity, and… that’s about it.All in all, the game is fairly simple, but it is generally well-executed. The levels are decent enough and generally quite short, making them relatively easy to beat in a short time – if you can do them right. Some of the later levels are quite hard, though, and despite the checkpoints in them can take upwards of ten minutes to 100%. The longest levels are the levels where you unlock your fellow octopi and the final level, where you confront a fairly difficult boss (though thankfully, with very generous checkpointing after each phase).The graphics look nice and are clean and attractive, and it is always clear what is going on. And if you don’t like the way the screen shifts around, you can change it to change the pace of screen rotation to avoid motion sickness and just keep it working the way you want it to.Sadly, the game never really feels exceptional. The game is consistently decent, and none of the levels are bad, but none of them are all that great, either. There was never a point in the game where I was wowed by it, and none of the levels really feel particularly organic (though they didn’t feel especially inorganic either – just sort of okay).It is worth noting that, despite the cute aesthetic, this game is not easy; while it isn’t Super Meat Boy level of hard, it is above-average difficulty for a 2D platformer, and some of the puzzles, particularly water ones, can be pretty finicky.It took me a bit under five hours to beat. If you want to 100% it, it will take more than twice as long, as the final levels are much, much harder than all the rest of the game. The very final level of the game took me nearly an hour to complete, and wasn’t really much fun – it was an exercise in frustration combined with checkpoint starvation, as you had to execute a very long sequence of tasks flawlessly, then do so again after the first checkpoint, then do so again after the second checkpoint. The endgame levels are often nightmarish in their difficulty, and are too hard to really be considered fun.On the whole, if you’ve already got this in your library and are itching for a 2D platformer, you could do worse… but honestly, you could do better, too. This is just okay, and the endgame is frustrating.			"

												The devs of this game were wondering why it failed. Well... I know exactly why. The mechanics initially give you the sense of a ""tight control"" system -- something that is essential for platformers. However when you actually play the levels, you realize that it's anything BUT.Example: Jumping out of the water to go on land, the height is inconsistent and hard to judge. The screen rotation speed always needs to be adjusted because on some levels if it's too slow, you again misjudge the jump height and get f*cked. Or don't see a baddie/obstacle coming your way. On other levels, if it's too fast, you need to put the controller down and take a break because your feel dizzy. It's a cool concept with potential, but the execution just misses the mark IMO. There are two types of difficulty in games - those that are artificially difficult because the controls don't let you translate your thoughts and into actions on screen the way you intended, and those that are difficult because you as a player need to step up your skills. This game is hard mostly because of the former, not latter.			"

												Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a decent but unexceptional 2D platformer game. You play as an octopus in a space helmet, sucked out of your ocean and cast off into space for… no apparent reason, honestly (the game has no real plot, and the villain of the game has no clear motivation). Your goal is to navigate through the levels, freeing various sea critters and ultimately, the other octopi who were kidnapped with you, all on the way to defeat the final boss.This is one of those games which plays heavily with gravity. Gravity orients itself straight downward, including on curved slopes, meaning you can walk along a curved surface without ever having to jump or break your stride, similar to walking around a 3D planet with gravity. However, most platforming sections do only allow one orientation of landing on the platforms, so only select surfaces (marked by grass and similar things) are actually “walkable”.The game has a fairly simple set of mechanics – you can walk, you can jump, and you can, depending on your particular octopus, do one of several other things (run faster, float, teleport, slow down time, or double jump). As with many such games, the complexity comes almost entirely from the levels, wherein you must contend with twisted gravity, gravity reversals, attacks from missile turrets and moving lasers, bottomless pits, water (which always reorients your gravity according to the direction you’re facing, though you float in it so it doesn’t really matter), poisonous water you can’t spend too much time in without dying, and a very small number of invincible enemy types (no enemies in the game can be beaten). There are switches which are used to open gates and at times reverse gravity, and… that’s about it.All in all, the game is fairly simple, but it is generally well-executed. The levels are decent enough and generally quite short, making them relatively easy to beat in a short time – if you can do them right. Some of the later levels are quite hard, though, and despite the checkpoints in them can take upwards of ten minutes to 100%. The longest levels are the levels where you unlock your fellow octopi and the final level, where you confront a fairly difficult boss (though thankfully, with very generous checkpointing after each phase).The graphics look nice and are clean and attractive, and it is always clear what is going on. And if you don’t like the way the screen shifts around, you can change it to change the pace of screen rotation to avoid motion sickness and just keep it working the way you want it to.Sadly, the game never really feels exceptional. The game is consistently decent, and none of the levels are bad, but none of them are all that great, either. There was never a point in the game where I was wowed by it, and none of the levels really feel particularly organic (though they didn’t feel especially inorganic either – just sort of okay).It is worth noting that, despite the cute aesthetic, this game is not easy; while it isn’t Super Meat Boy level of hard, it is above-average difficulty for a 2D platformer, and some of the puzzles, particularly water ones, can be pretty finicky.It took me a bit under five hours to beat. If you want to 100% it, it will take more than twice as long, as the final levels are much, much harder than all the rest of the game. The very final level of the game took me nearly an hour to complete, and wasn’t really much fun – it was an exercise in frustration combined with checkpoint starvation, as you had to execute a very long sequence of tasks flawlessly, then do so again after the first checkpoint, then do so again after the second checkpoint.

												Overall Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a good indie platformer. The game has some great level design and does a good job utilizing the different mechanics added throughout the game. The game is also quite long which includes 60+ levels (at the time of this review I have not finished the entire game). I expect the game will take around ten hours to complete unless you are really good at platformers.At the beginning of the game I would consider Airscape to be moderately difficult. Around the midway point the game gets considerably harder and some of the levels are kind of frustrating. If you like harder platformers I think you will really enjoy Airscape: The Fall of Gravity.Note: I received a free review copy of the game but received no other compensation for this review.Read My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com] "

			Airscape Review Section Timecodes: Controls and Performance: http://youtu.be/ndxykC48ROY_s?t=52s Difficulty: http://youtu.be/ndxykC48ROY_s?t=1m49s Graphical Quality:...		

IntroductionAirscape: The Fall of gravity is a platformer in a similar vein to games like Super Meat Boy.  The release date is August 11th 2015 on Steam with the primary platform being PC, but the dev has confirmed that release day Linux support is planned.  They also specified Mac support as well for August, but I haven’t seen anything else confirming it directly as yet.While the game doesn’t have the same degree of cartoonish gore as Super meat Boy, a number of the game mechanics will feel somewhat familiar.  The unique element that it brings to the table is game area rotation with a heavy focus on gravity to solve the various levels.You are an Octopus who’s friends have been kidnapped by mysterious mechanical beings.  And it is your task to navigate levels, rescuing critters while avoiding deadly traps and mastering gravity.Controls and PerformanceAirscape feels good to play from a control perspective.  The character movements are very responsive whether you’re using the keyboard or a controller.  By and large, the control options are fairly simplistic which adds to overall aestheticAs far as performance goes, the obvious intent behind Airscape is to maintain a crisp 60 frames per second.  It switches resolutions on the fly without reloading the graphics like most games require, likely a feature of its’ HTML5 base.  Further to that, it has an option to downscale graphical quality on the fly in order to maintain a high framerate which is incredibly important to platformers, especially ones of this kind where precise movements are the difference between success and failure.Normally, rotational motion is a huge problem in games because of people prone to motion sickness.  The devs included a very simple option to let you choose precisely how fast the screen rotates, as well as controlling screen shake which handles the motion sickness problem handily.  Turning the rotation down too slow, can impact how well you can play as the game is obviously intended to be played unadjusted, but that is a relatively minor gripe.DifficultyAirscape can be very hard, perhaps unless you’re a platforming master.  You will run into sections and levels that cause frustration but the beauty of the difficulty curve is that it is manageable.  A level is difficult for a while, until you master the movements to make it through.  And the devs did a good job of changing up the variety so that no two levels seem to have quite the same failure point.  I found that I never ran into a brick wall, two levels in a row which is clever forward thinking design. Graphical QualityWhen choosing to go with a stylized aesthetic as Cross-Product did, you can get away with some things graphically speaking that would otherwise be a problem.  It is not an amazing looking game by any stretch.  The color palette is very bright, the characters very cute.  I did feel that some more personality could have been added to your metallic opponents though.  The world is very style heavy, but a number of the obstacle types are lackluster by comparison.There is a fair amount of attention to detail though in minor animation on the level.  Everything from background animation and skyboxes down to trees and bushes swaying when you move past them.Ultimately, the graphical presentation isn’t harmed in any way by the simple aesthetic.  It is a game that should age very well.Quality AssuranceI have very few concerns on the quality assurance side of the coin.  Airscape is a very simplistic game in its’ overall design, which leads to fewer bugs and Cross-Product has delivered a solid game that I didn’t experience any major issues or crashes.  The only bug related problems that I encountered in my playthrough were related to music overlaps where the music would occasionally not terminate when exiting a level, causing multiple tracks to be played over top of one another simultaneously.  This is a frustrating problem that does require reloading the game to fix, but it also wasn’t something that happened all the time, so in the grand scheme of things is relatively minor.SummaryAirscape: The Fall Of Gravity is a clever platformer with game mechanics that are fairly uncommon.  I can’t say that they are entirely brand new ideas, but put together in a cohesive, if ridiculous and cute package that is satisfying from start to finish.  You will die, you will get stuck, you might even walk away ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, only to return an hour later and smash that tricky level to dust.The performance and control scheme is spot on, the game looks good and is a ton of fun to play.  People who get hit harder by motion sickness may want to avoid it, or at least try out the demo first before committing to a purchase.All in all, it is a very solid game with few problems.  If you’re a fan of platformers, then this title is right down your alley and is definitely worth your time.  It does what it sets out to do very well.Rating9 out of 10. "

This game oozes charm in ever aspect and the physic's engine is superb. Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a fast-paced, gravity-shifting action platformer about a deep-sea octopus who has been kidnapped by a mechanical alien race. Jump, dodge, and swim through a skybound environment full of floating islands, water formations, and robotic terrors. - Highly Recommended!			"

												A beautiful game with an interesting (albeit dizziness-inducing) concept and nice music. Not worth buying at full price, IMO.The game's main problem is its high difficulty, which cannot be adjusted. I already prefer to play many (mainstream) games on hard mode, but in Airscape I sometimes have to attempt the same little part of the game dozens of times before I get through. Reaching the Blue Octopus at the end of Zone 5 was nearly impossible (I surely died over 100 times) and now I'm stuck on the next level afterward. Casual gamers, stay well away! As for me, I'm getting frustrated and am inclined to quit.Nits: In my opinion, the camera is often zoomed in too far (not just in gameplay but also on the ""world map""). There should be a key or option to zoom out. Regarding the controls, my instinct is to use ""Up"" to swim up but ""Space"" to jump, and I'm not allowed to have it both ways. Also, it is strange that I can use W-A-S-D to move around on the world map but only the arrow keys work inside a level. Occasionally one encounters bugs (e.g. getting stuck in an object). Finally, occasionally I mistake background objects for foreground objects and vice versa.			"

												Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a gravity based platformer putting players in control of a Dumbo Octopus who must swim and jump through strange lands to rescue his fellow aquatic friends from aliens.Players control their octopus with the arrow keys with Up to jump and Shift used to dash or activate a special ability in some cases. Other octopuses with unique abilities are unlocked as players complete zones. My favorite is the blue one, which can teleport small distances instead of dashing. Each zone is broken into about three or four levels with a few exceptions. These zones are made of stylistically themed floating platforms and waterways and each introduces a new kind of danger or platforming element. Some zones introduce stretches of acid players must swim through before it kills them, snipers that instakill if the player stops moving, roving robots that follow the player along the ground, and later levels will combine these elements.Final Score: 8/10 - Great ""While not the most original platformer, Airscape: The Fall of Gravity mixes many elements into a challenging and nerve-wracking platformer that anyone can enjoy.""Read the full review: [http://techraptor.net/content/airscape-fall-gravity-review]			"

												eh. Its not really my cup of tea. The levels arent really that hard if you just take it slowly and the frame rate is slow (though thats most likely my computer). It has some great art and good music, but the gameplay is just not for me.			"

												Do not buy. This game is broken and incredibly frustrating because of it.Seems like it was going for some kind of interesting mix between Mario Galaxy and Super Meat Boy. Unfortunately, it utterly fails due to a god awful buggy control scheme and camera. The screen rotation mechanic is horrible. You can set it to quickly rotate with your character at the cost of experiencing constant nausea and being unable to track it with your eyes, or you can set it to rotate slower so that you will find it difficult if not impossible to control your character, and while swimming it's completely disorienting. Half the time I have no idea which direction I'll go when I jump, move or swim, and in a game like this which challenges you to be extremely precise and subtle with your platforming, it's a huge problem. This was somewhat bearable until I progressed to the poison water world with the teleporting octo, where you can only stay in the water for a few seconds. The complete and utter frustration I have experienced from this should be a warning to potential buyers. You will teleport in seemingly almost any random driection other than the one you intended, teleport into solid objects, teleport backwards for no reason, and you will die. Over, and over, and over again. Sums up pretty much the experience of the whole game.If you enjoy a challenging game with near constant deaths and frustration due to a disorienting camera and poorly implemented controls, then this is the game for you. If you want to waste a few hours on it anyway, buy it when it's cheap.			"

Orchestal Music! Simple visuals... and damn difficulty.Before reading my review, you may notive that most positive ones, doesn't have more than ~3 hours.Damn, game has some awesome (orchestral) music. And not bad graphics, but mechanics... are not so good. I really hate all lasers-time-based-♥♥♥♥♥-that-gives-you-not-much-time... Game starts quite easy, but newer mechanics, introduced later aren't that good.Also numerous bugs - music playing like underwater, while not being in water. Music not playing at all, but, when in menu it plays. And generally sometimes FPS drops... for this kind of game, it's really weird. I mention a lot that I have wooden PC, but game like Portal 2 works fluenty on 50-60 fps...			"

												A big NO. I don't know what the big fuss about this game and got so many positive reviews. I find it pretty mundane, sometimes confusing, sometimes extremely easy.

												There is a good game here I can feel it, but the learning curve is really bad.  The first 2 zones were really fun and taught me the basics.  Then I sudenly felt like I was playing a bullet hell game except I didn't get a weapon or any defenses.  Most of my deaths didn't feel like they were my fault; it felt like I was sliding all over the place.And the gameplay video makes the movement seem very fluid, and it very fluid unless you get nausea easily.  I suggest you go get a copy of super mario galaxy instead.			"

												Didn't like Airscape at all. Although I bought the game on sale and it was dirt cheap, the game is pretty generic and not very interesting. The game reminded me so much of the typical games you would find on sites like addicting games and that's pretty much what it is, a cute flash game. I typically buy games like these because I don't have the best computer in the world, it's fairly decent but it could not run at full fps even in the lowest quality setting. Overall this game seems like something I would really enjoy as a child but not as old as I am 2/10			"

												PSA for Linux users, beware - Controller issues reported as far back in Sept 2015 have not been addressed. Xbox Wired and Wireless and XBOX One controllers appear in some cases to have incorrect mapping making ""run"" all but impossible to use as it recognises ""start"" as the right trigger and whatever you do in the rebinding menu this seems impossible to fix as it doesn't recognise the triggers at all anyway.. rebinding to another button does not work.The developer moaned on social media that making a good game does not equal sales because of poor figures, well, supporting customers with issues would make a good developer, wouldn't it, perhaps garnering support for future efforts.If you're happy playing with keyboard, it looks like you'll probably be fine.

												This is a very fun and creative little platforming game. It can be a little disorienting at first, but you can adjust how fast the camera reacts to the shifts in gravity on the fly, which helps with the motion sickness you can get from these sorts of perspective changes. That being said if you ARE already prone to motion sickness, this is not the game for you. I normally don't have problems and I started feeling a little weird at around the 5th world (rotating 'planets' of earth start getting involved).

												Fun little game to kill some time. Super easy to pick up the controls. It did give me a little bit of motion sickness at first from the screen rotation but after adjusting the settings it was much better. Great value at £0.15			"

Airscape: The Fall of Gravity - A Steam Review [Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes] The good  The quirky graphics Nice gameplay idea  The not so good:  The rotation is a lot, even at the lowest setting. Can’t play this game more than one hour at a time. The distance the fans blow you differs even though you do the same thing, which can lead to some frustrating deaths The conclusion: Even though the graphics look childish, don’t be fooled, this is a hard game. You will die a lot and most of the time it’ll be your fault. You will get dizzy, you will get sick. I can’t recommend it because I couldn’t get into it, I think the rotation was too much. But if hard platformers are your jam, do give this game a try. You can see me playing it here -

												Good game if you get it for $0.20. The controls are too inaccurate and the physics system is irregular. There is a ""bug"" or undesired behavior when you change the gravitational plane. I would recommend it if you like casual games.UPDATE:The more I play the less I like it... the game is so unfair. It is unfair because you have to have perfect timing and with the current state of the controls is quite hard.			"

												stupid game, low quality. i got it for 30 cents and its still now worth my money. borderline awful game. this games levels are all the same. there are no new concepts after level 5 and awful graphics/plain art style. the GUI for keyboards is impossible to play with and its not fun or rewarding to beat a level. It includes close to no story, and like i said the gameplay does not make up for it. in the end this games main reason for being so bad is the fact that the levelsare so repetitive and boring.			"

												Airscape: the Fall of Gravity, or as I now call it, Airscape: Why you should be wary of review embargoes.Yes, Airscape does, or did, have a review and streaming embargo and at first glance one is hard put to think of a reason why. The game has a demo on Steam that is fun to play. It has simple but lovely graphics and a very easy set of game mechanics coupled to some fairly interesting physics and a decent control system. All these things point to the game being pretty damned cool and it is, right until it is not.At first glance Airscape: The Fall of Gravity may well remind you of a classic platformer on a Nintendo system called Super Mario Galaxy but in a colourful 2D. You jump around as various sea creatures from small islands or floating water globules spinning the screen, swimming fast or slow as you collect other various sea creatures who bounce along merrily behind you until you find a portal that sets them free. Between yourself and these lovable creatures are various traps, bombs, squid bashing robots, lasers and… well, everything really! It feels extremely smooth, very controllable and generally lovely to play.If you have been lucky enough to boot up the free demo (is there any other kind?) you will likely come away quite happy thinking that, yes, this is a game you could buy and enjoy once it is released. The problem lies in after you have purchased the full game at whatever undisclosed price it shall be. Hopefully just before you do you will manage to read this or other reviews that are allowed to be read a whole one day before the game goes on global sale because what you see in the demo is essentially it but with harder levels, harder puzzles that sometimes become frustrating in some areas and no real reward bar some small progression and possibly a chance to punch yourself in the arm proudly.Do not get me wrong, if you enjoy the kind of puzzle game you often find on your mobile device and if this games full release price is around five US Dollars then you could still walk away with a feeling of satisfaction however if you expect an actual in-depth PC game then you may well be best looking elsewhere because whilst the levels do vary in looks they do not vary much in the overall experience and this is why, based purely on assumption and forty years of gaming, I think this game had a review and stream embargo. I am quite sure the publishers and PR people will claim it is so as not to spoil the surprise of later levels or the bosses you get to fight but in reality I think we as gamers know that it is to avoid anyone saying “Is that it?” before buying it.

												The Game should be called Bugscape or Airbug cause the full game is buggy like sh**. You can't even play it very good, I glitched through islands and died because of water. Really I don't understand why people keep playing this because the game don't even work as it should. Even the Soundtrack was like I'm hearing a bad dubstep Intro.

												This game is seriously underrated - got it for 19 cents and didn't expect much of it, just a standard platformer. Wow, was I wrong. New challenges keep popping up and keeps you interested - it's not too easy and it's not too hard, plus there are a lot of really cute characters. Great animations, great controls, great music. DEFINITELY recommending this to anyone out there.			"

												The one word that comes up for Airscape for me is: frustration. Not the reason why I play games.All you can do is run around and jump, what you must do is time that very well or you'll get thrown back to a checkpoint.The game mechanic where all surfaces have their own gravity is clever, but that makes you dizzy too.Maybe it gets more interesting later on, but I just couldn't play it anymore.

												So youre a cute lil octopus whose underwater world has been distorted by presumably aliens or something. You have to rescue your cute lil fish friends in each crazy gravity distorted level while avoiding all the things that could squish you.

												Airscape is a platform game about a couple of alien octopus which are kidnapped from their home town and need to fight for survival. Graphics The graphics are really good for an indie game. The multiple colors blend nicely, creating a nice view for your eyes. The quality is not the best, but this is not a bad thing, because the game is nice for its simplicity. Gameplay The gameplay is really easy to learn, like the overall of platform games: you move,  jump and, dash and you can also float a little when you jump if you keep the jump button pressed. The levels start easy and start to get really tough when you progress through the game. Your octopus is reallty fragile, because only one enemy hit will kill him, so you will die A LOT here. Fortunatelly, you have infinite lives and you start at the last checkpoint you used.The interface has a map which you can roam freely at it, without needing to go through a fixed path, until you go to the level of your choice. At each level, you collect until 3 items which are used to unlock some special areas where you can unlock new octopus to play with. They are different colors and I have unlocked the blue one so far. Probably they are a little different to use, but I'm not sure, because I unlocked only one.The difference of this game to other platforms is the gravity theme: a little like Mario Galaxy, you'll get to some places where you'll upside down, pushed by the gravity of some places and this sometimes can be kind of annoying. Fortunatelly, it's a minor issue and it doesn't affect the gameplay. Audio & Soundtrack The soundtrack is simple, yet beautiful, without being annoying. It's composed of relaxing tones so you feel at ease.Storyline As a plartform game, the story usually is really simple, because there's no need to understand it in order to play. You are controling alien octopus kidnapped by an unknow force and need to survive throuygh the levels. That's all you know so far.The veredictIt's a nice and relaxing platform game, with easy controls, but with levels getting harder when you progress through the game. I really enjoyed and would recommend for any platform game fans. Grab this game while at a sale if you are uncertain about it, you won't regret.Rating:Graphics: 8/10Audio: 8/10Gameplay: 8,5/10Overall: 8/10			"

												It's a beautiful game with a unique concept where you rotate the world and climb. Unfortunately that concept is scientifically intolerable for extended periods of time (i.e. your eyes can rotate inside your head to stabilize the image, so they get confused when the world is rotating on them without their permission (you're practically guaranteed to hurt after a half hour of play)). But it is really fun. Catch it on sale, have a laugh, save some fishes, get a headache, probably repeat.			"

												I love games with interesting and lean level design and this game freaking hexcells in it.  For example on the secret level in zone 5 the level consists of 4 moving blocks and a small patch of water.  Too simple you say?  take a seat lad before you hurt yourself.  You have to platform under the blocks without getting crushed, then swim up the water missing some lazers and platform on the same blocks without getting crushed from above.  SUCH ECONOMY!!! MUCH WOW!!!!  On another level there is a water feature that spins in an erratic nature.  On first go you are able to get only two of the 3 little buddies because one is abducted much too quick for the time it takes to navigate the water.  After close exanimation of the level (WHICH YOU CAN F*&^% DO FROM THE LEVEL SELECT SCREEN!!! AWESOME FEATURE YO!!!!) you notice that the level is designed that from the start of the level if you get enough propulsion you can jump right to the end and catch your buddy before its kidnapped. DESIGN INGENUITY OVER 9000!!!!!!!   If you don't buy this game at 19 cents, your mother will be disappointed in your life choices.			"

												I bought this on a Humble Store sale, so it was more than the current Steam sale price of .19. I don't regret paying a higher price, because this game is great. I honestly think it's sad that it's on such a deep sale, because the developer obviously put a lot of work into this game, and it certainly shows. Buy it. If you buy it now for .19, you're getting the best cheap game I've seen. If you buy it for a little more or the regular price, you won't be dissapointed either. I hope more people find out about this little gem, and that people are willing to pay more than .19 like I did, because the developers deserve it for making such a great little game.			"

												Cute idea and cute graphics to match. The game has a neat feature where it will reduce the resolution in order to increase the FPS, so that gameplay can flow more easily. Sadly, this function works whether you want it to or not, and when put at a lower resolution the game is flat-out not attractive (particularly annoying since the graphics are simple, so it's an issue with programming). It left me with a game where ithe graphics were messed up enough that I couldn't really tell what was happening. There's also no story. Some big drill hits the starting area and sucks everyone away, and then you get a ""some time later"" thing that pops up and your avatar is on land with a helmet on. What happened? Maybe it's explained later, but I wouldn't be able to get that far with the graphics looking so bad.			"

												This is truly the 'Dark Souls' of the platformer genre. It's loads of fun with some replay value and generates quite the challenge. You will inevitably get frustrated, and it is likely the developers' goal for this to be so. For what it is, it's great. If you're not into games that are incredibly hard, then take a pass on this one. No one will judge you, and the litteral THOUSANDS of tiny adorable octupi that won't be killed thanks to your decision will be forever grateful.			"

												In interesting, gravity-based platformer.  It sadly seems almost momentus at this point but it's 2-D platformer with honest-to-god originality and creativity; even more surprisingly, it actually works well too.  Here are some high and low points,  - The ability to moderate how quickly or slowly the camera shifts orientation really does a lot mitigate any problems of possible motion sickness.  - The music is actually not bad, though maybe a little loud, but that's easily rectified messing with the sound mixer.  - The difficulty fluctuates easily with how hard YOU want to make it (moderately difficult just ""finishing"" each stage, or an intense challenge if you choose to 100% everything and rescue all the little critters).  - Good variation in playable characters.  As you proceed you unlocke different octopi, each allowing for a slightly different playstyle.  x Sometimes where the gravity shifts from planetoid to planetoid is non-obvious, leading to a degree of trial and error (quite annoying if the stage is lax on checkpoints)x F**k Sniper Rifles, seriously, I can't be the only one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of with entire levels composed entirely of running away from these guys.In summary, A breath of fresh air in a stale genre.  Pick it up, it's well worth sinking a couple hours into.			"

												Fun little platformer.  The gravity mechanic where the ceiling can become your floor is neat and works smoothly.  Collecting all of the creatures on a given level is fun, makes me want to try and collect them all even if I only need one to proceed.  I like the world system, with small stages making up a world section of the game.  I did a weird sound issue where it was like the audio was stuttering or something, kind of like when your fps is too low in an emulator.  Went back to normal after restarting but then it cropped back up after playing a handful of levels.  Pretty minor issue, though.  Otherwise, it's a fun little game that I'd recommend picking up if it was cheap enough (sub $1).			"

												Being a gamer, I love a challenge, but this game takes challenges to a whole new level. The physics on the game are so wonky and sensative that you will spend around 5 - 6 hours just trying to master going through water. And don't even bother trying to collect all of the rings 100%, Its next to impossible. You have to quite literally speed run the levels in order to make it to certain rings, and even then, you make it with 1/10th to 1/20th of a second to spare. If you bumb yourself wrong, or cant get on that 1 ledge that needs EXACTLY the correct degree angle jump, then you will never complete this game 100%. I have raged at a lot of games in my lifetime, but no game brings out my anger and frustration like this one. This game is obnoxiously difficult, massivly time consuming (Because of the THOUSANDS of times you will have to play the SAME level over and over), and just starts loosing its appeal and fun factor. On a good note, The graphics and sounds are amazing, and its fun playing as an adorable little octopus. But its just too damn unforgiving to actually make me want to play for more than a few hours. Maybe Nearly Impossible games are your thing, but its just not mine.			"

												A platformer that sports colorful graphics, decent music, solid level design, and Steam trading cards that cover the price of the game. Unfortunately, it also contains a difficulty curve that ramps up too quickly as well as an extremely disorienting camera due to the gravity mechanic. I don't ever get motion-sickness from playing games, but this one was an exception.Overall, it's fun for an hour or so, though I didn't have it in me to complete it due to its flaws.

												Seems like a pretty decent game, at least when you turn off screen rotation (which gives terrible motion sickness). Unfortunately, I can see why it wouldn't sell a lot. The difficulty caters to the Super Meat Boy demographic, and maybe hardcore platformers don't have that much of an audience outside games like SMB. They certainly aren't my thing, I wouldn't have gotten it at full price. Also, the story is virtually non existent which doesn't help the game differentiate itself from the pack.			"

You have to quite literally speed run the levels in order to make it to certain rings, and even then, you make it with 1/10th to 1/20th of a second to spare. If you bumb yourself wrong, or cant get on that 1 ledge that needs EXACTLY the correct degree angle jump, then you will never complete this game 100%. I have raged at a lot of games in my lifetime, but no game brings out my anger and frustration like this one. This game is obnoxiously difficult, massivly time consuming (Because of the THOUSANDS of times you will have to play the SAME level over and over), and just starts loosing its appeal and fun factor. On a good note, The graphics and sounds are amazing, and its fun playing as an adorable little octopus. But its just too damn unforgiving to actually make me want to play for more than a few hours. Maybe Nearly Impossible games are your thing, but its just not mine.			"

												A platformer that sports colorful graphics, decent music, solid level design, and Steam trading cards that cover the price of the game. Unfortunately, it also contains a difficulty curve that ramps up too quickly as well as an extremely disorienting camera due to the gravity mechanic. I don't ever get motion-sickness from playing games, but this one was an exception.Overall, it's fun for an hour or so, though I didn't have it in me to complete it due to its flaws. If you can get past them, you should definitely buy this game.			"

												I bought this game for less than 50c because it was on sale and I wanted to see a construct 2 engine game on steam. I only played it briefly but now I know why people love Super Meat Boy. This game feels like what I imagine meat boy feeling like (never played meat boy, I am just using my imagination here and extrapolating).I played with a controller and only a couple of levels in and it feels very nice to play. Level based games are not my kind of thing, but if I were into these kinds of games, this one would be something I would probably try to finish. The puzzles and mechanics of 360 degree movement + platforming + the ability to adjust the camera motion make the fluidity of the gameplay feel quite satisfying. The art style is adorable, maybe a little to pastel for my taste, but it's still charming :)If the rest of the game has this level of quality for a small indie studio making a game in C2, well, that's very impressive. The team should be proud. I loved the opening of the game too, felt like I was part of the inciting incident (wasn't just a cutscene). As someone who is looking to make a game in C2 (I am more into writing and drawing/animating, so need an easy engine to work with) I am very very impressed by what the team has achieved. C2 may not be optimal for lower end systems, but the game ran well on mine so far - reccomended!			"

												I haven't beat this game yet, but I aim to, and with that being said: This game is cute. I like octopi too. I'm not too big on platformers because I suck at them, but this the controls and objectives are simple enough to get the hang of, while still being challenging enough to offer enjoyment. Some of the levels were bogging down my computer both in sound and fps issues, oddly, considering I've played games with heftier graphical content with no issues. Maybe my computer is garbage. All in all though, I liked it. If you like platformers and games without a lot of bells and whistles, so to speak, you'd probably enjoy this.			"

I almopst gave up on the game but after they displayed the rotation settings I set it to 20% and then it was great. I think they may have given a better first impression by starting out with less rotation and let people increase it. Use j and k keys to adjust the spinning view and then give it a chance and you'll be glad you did,			"

												Cute little game. Rich imagination grativy world. Got it on 90% off with $0.49 so good value for that.Things I can think to improve:1. The rule of gravity doesn't rule as it seems to be. For example if I turn myself upside down and far from land, I would expect gravity rules change accordingly, rather than still falling into same direction. But I think that could be a challenge on level design.2. Even though you can change the setting, the game is still VERY dizzy. After 30 mins I feel very dizzy when I quit the game. And I don't even feel much dizzy when playing VR games.3. Difficulty curve is not that reasonable.			"

												The first reasons the I got this game is because it says that it was inspired by Mario Galaxy, and that is really true, the first levels of the game are amazing, great gameplay, great musics, great level design, I was really loving it at some times, but in the half of the game, it got too hard, oh my god how it got so hard? Why are people really doing this kind of mechanics and level design, what for?, then latter I found another level designs and mechanics master peaces, weird right? That is a inconsistency of the overall quality, sometimes it's the best action platformer I played this year, some another times it's a ♥♥♥♥ing hard broken mess, I already finished the game, but I'm not coming back, I don't want to suffer anymore, but it's a good game, just give it a try, it's really cheap anyway.About the sales, I think it's really selling so poorly because it's not on Game Consoles, mainly on Nintendo consoles, most of people that still really care about good platform games is there, better luck next time, I'm still looking forward for this company games, see ya.

												A fun platformer. Claims to be ""mario 3d galaxy-esque"" and it does deliver. However it has more of a ""raymen legends"" feel. The soundtrack is fun and gives a whimsical feel which is the feeling I would expect while trying to save my octopus brethren from robot aliens in space. 9/10 Fits perfectly into the category of game is extremely fun and challanging. However I feel the controls when exiting and entering different gravity zones can sometimes be difficult to deal with. Although frustrating at times, it is challanging and fun.			"

												Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is game where you play a little octopus swimming around in the sea, when you are suddenly abducted by Aliens and brought to an unknown world with the mission to get your friends back, but is it fun ?On the first hand,  isn't too bad. The gameplay is fun and also quiet different from what I was able to see in other games. As it is already in the title it play with another form of gravity. The gravity in the game works different than expected, which allows some interesting options when it comes to movement. Furthermore from what I have been able to see so far (which isn't that much) the game seems quiet diverse. After only playing for 20 minutes I already saw an ocean, a desert, normal grasland, and some more. Some of these parts even interact with each other. You basically play through levels belonging to a section. At the end of each section waits an endlevel ( I wouldn't call it an endboss though) where you have to rescue one of your friends. Through this you can slowly unlock other octopuses, which you can then play with. To unlock the final level you have to collect, let's simply call it stars, ( it's more kind of a sharp, but anyway). In each level you will find some of these stars. You actually don't have to collect all to get to the next level, so you still can come back later to get them, and let your inner perfectionnist be happy. Finally the graphics are neat. They look good, of course it's only a 2D game but no complains about that. The music is also nice.Though there are also some flaws. First off there is no real story as such. You do get what the game is trying to tell you, but that's it. It would have been nice to have a bit of storytellling in it. Furthermore the game is kind of repetetive. Of course you play yourself through different worlds, but the gameplay isn't changing that much. You keep jumping around, evading ennemies, and so on. Another complain I have is the resolution. There are in my opinion not enough options to chose your resolution from. I would have liked to have a 1440x 2560 option.Also the mouvement is a bit unprecise, that has to be fixed !Anyway, I would recommand the game if you like this style of game. To be honest it looks for met more like a mobile game, but for sure there are people that like that, and I think that you can have fun with it in that case. The game isn't really the style of game I normally play, but I will probably play it again.I also want to thank the developpers who offered me a free copy of the game.			"

												Initial thoughts:I just got this game and it is very good. It gets challenging quickly.There are a few issues I do have. Sometimes the octopus gets stuck when jumping to a ledge from underneath (very common in the water levels) and the effect when switching characters makes it a bit confusing (it keeps switching back and forth, which makes it hard to tell whether you picked a chatacter or not). While I haven't finished it, I do feel rather sad that it only has 60 levels. Will update review as I get more into it.			"

												At first, I got this game because it was on sale for 21 cents, and I had just that, so I got it.I did not realize what I was getting myself into. Such a good game... The gravity is a cool idea, and sometimes disorienting. Having to save all the critters is a hard task, especially if you do not know where they are, and even harder if they are timed. This makes me rage more than any other game, but I keep coming back to it, to try to beat it. I recommend this game to anyone who likes platformer games, and/or games that make you ultimately rage, but so, SO happy when you beat it.			"

												This is probably the most rage inducing game ive played, i mean the fact that i wasnt was in a good mood when i started playing probably doesnt help, but its litterarly mario 2 on ice when it comes to gameplay.The controls in water is confusing and irritating as hell.The fans are also insanely confusing, sometimes they let you float at a height, somtimes they behave like a spring, and you never know which one it is before testing it, and sometimes it even behaves like both.Which makes it even more irritating when you guessed wrong and have to redo almost half a level.The music is also confusing, its jumping between realxing and intense, like its unsure which its more of.I understand that its supposed to be difficult but i must admit that i would play any game at all, thankfully i barely paid anything for this.But i guess if you want a mario 2 on ice then have fun, if you want a hard plattformer then i would rather suggest something else like Bloody Trapland, yes its more expensive but id say its more worth it.Id say the only plus about this is game is that its a child friendly plattformer, but considering how rage inducing it is i wouldnt suggest it for kids.

												The game looks cute, has nice sound design and, from what I could see, has a pretty formulaic, but nicely done gameplay based on two core mechanics. On land it's non-violent platforming: you jump around, while gravity attracts you to the nearest surface, dodging as everything is trying to kill you. Underwater it's thrust-based swimming, careful and fast navigation of mazes and, again, dodging as everything is trying to kill you. This looks like it could be several hours of fun.Unfortunately, the first hour gave me motion sickness, so bad that I had to drop the game. Its screen just keeps rotating, making me dizzy, and I couldn't go past the first few worlds. If you never had any problems like this, give it a try, otherwise just look at the trailer fullscreen and imagining doing this for an hour.			"

												It started with a bad impression. Very soon in this game, every thing gets really hard. Like laser beams targetting you while you're trying to swim and changing the gravity at the same time, and even harder some times. You will start over and over, like 20 times most of the levels to finish them. Every level is a hard work on the pad to get through the whole world making everything to kill you.But every level is also a nice puzzle to solve, if you don't succeed after 10 times trying to do something, that means there might be another way that works. And graphics are nice, it's just an octopus wandering among the world, but it looks friendly.If you're not afraid of difficulty, play this game, you won't regret it!			"

												This game freaks me out man..I run around like a mad dude and eventually I get dizzy.I get blown up and do the same thing over and over again again until I finally get past it. I then get wrecked once again (unbelievable) before the next part... I finally get past it and do it all again on a different level with a different guy.There are baddies and cool looking loveable buddies with funny faces.I don't know if i'm playing a computerised version of my life or not... either way both are fun, cheap and somewhat slightly frustrating at the same time.

												This game's physics are a nice breath of fresh air in platformers but can make the game a bit disorienting at times. This game is also extremely challenging Dark Souls-level or greater difficulty, and the deaths felt just as undeserved sometimes. Despite this, however hard the game gets, it is always doable eventually, and there is very little penalty for dying: it is a natural part of the gameplay. 13 hours of gameplay for a 50 cent game (when on sale) is nothing to scoff at either. Pros:Interesting phyicsExtreme difficultyGreat soundtrackCons:Undeserved deathsExtreme difficulty on some levels Some bugs in objects not rendering on screen or getting stuck while moving(particularly on the very last level)  "

												The first reasons the I got this game is because it says that it was inspired by Mario Galaxy, and that is really true, the first levels of the game are amazing, great gameplay, great musics, great level design, I was really loving it at some times, but in the half of the game, it got too hard, oh my god how it got so hard? Why are people really doing this kind of mechanics and level design, what for?, then latter I found another level designs and mechanics master peaces, weird right? That is a inconsistency of the overall quality, sometimes it's the best action platformer I played this year, some another times it's a ♥♥♥♥ing hard broken mess, I already finished the game, but I'm not coming back, I don't want to suffer anymore, but it's a good game, just give it a try, it's really cheap anyway.About the sales, I think it's really selling so poorly because it's not on Game Consoles, mainly on Nintendo consoles, most of people that still really care about good platform games is there, better luck next time, I'm still looking forward for this company games, see ya.

												Ok so this game is pretty good if you can cope with two things. 1-It's really hard. Die lots, try again. (Thankfully, that suits me fine)2-The orbital gravity mechanic can knock you sick if like me you get dizzy easily. (You can reduce the spin speed on the fly but it still bothers me a little at it's lowest setting.)It probably could do with some more character too. e.g Give the octopusses (octopii?) more individuality. Name them. Maybe have different species rather than different colours. Despite these things, It's good fun and well crafted. It's on sale as I write this for next to nothing. Try it out.			"

												This is a very fun platformer. It does a great job keeping up the variety with mechanics like gravity flipping, swimming through sky bubbles, rocket platforms and snipers. Despite starting out super easy and looking child-friendly the difficulty scales up pretty dramatically as the game goes on.Camera flipping and disorientation are part of the core premise, but yes it could be nauseating for some people. And it can be hard to control in some parts (such as a segment where the camera flips every few seconds, or any part where you have to jump between sky bubbles in a hurry). Also there's a few segments later on that seemed virtually impossible until I switched to the teleporter character.Overall, for anyone who thinks the trailer looks remotely interesting, I recommend this game.

												Airscape really surprised me, I bought it on special for under a dollar and was expecting a cheap little game to spend a day or two on, I actually ended up getting a fast paced challenging game at a steal of a price that kept me busy for quite a while.At first it seems pretty basic and the controls/camera movements feel a little weird, but once you get the rhythm of the game down it really is a blast. It has kind of a Meatboy feel to it, but the underwater controls bring a whole new dimension and a plethora of new challenges to the game which I hadn’t expected in a platformer like this. I’ve always been kind of a completionist so games like this, with achievements, items to get in each level, and unlockable characters, tend to really grab my attention. Getting every ‘critter’ (3 in each level) was really a challenge, finding them can range from an easy jump to speed running through a level at impossible speeds, some of them require a certain character or precise timing; suffice to say you won’t be able to complete the game 100% without a challenge.Tl;dr : challenging game with unique controls and plenty of unlockables /achievements to keep you busy, well worth the price.

												I randomly came across this game during a sale one time. I find it fun and pretty challenging at times. I earned the Fried Squid achievement really quickly. The music is really nice, and the art is cute, but I did have to get used to the world rotation! (It's sometimes difficult for people to watch me play.) I'm normally not good at platformers, but I love puzzles so navigating the traps is fun and each little octopus has it's own talent. :)Note about motion sickness and rotation %:I get motion sick really easily and I didn't really realize this game moved the way it did when I got it. So at first when I was figuring out the controls and how to move, I got a headache and dizzy real fast. I tried to turn down rotation slower, but then the ""lag"" effect from the world movement being slower than the character was so hard to deal with and practically made it worse. Then I turned rotation off but it was just too hard to navigate the game even when constantly recentering the camera. So I took a chance and actually increased it to the full 200% and it was WAAAAAAY better. I haven't gotten any headaches, nausea, or anything. The faster rotation worked well because you can focus on your octopus and navigate with your peripheral vision. So if you get dizzy, it might sound counter-productive, but give the higher % a try. :)			"

												I was able to play about 15 minutes of this game before i became violently ill from motion sickness.  This does not mean that Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is a bad game, because it isn't.  The characters are pretty unqiue, as is the gameplay.  But if you are prone to getting motion sickness, I would not recommend it.  If you do not experience that, you are in for a fun and good time!			"

												Warning: this game has some fast camera movement that you may have to get used to. If you're not sure you can stand it, you might want to get an impression first by watching a gameplay video.I bought this game as part of a bundle, and was positively surprised. It's a nice, challenging platformer with a cute art style.There's not much story to this game -- you're an octopus that's happily swimming in the sea doing whatever octopuses do, when one day an alien disrupts the peace by abducting all the ocean's inhabitants. You will control the octopus on a journey to rescue his abducted friends. You will visit a lot of different 'worlds', and each world will have a few levels that introduce new gameplay elements and enemies. Your goal is to navigate from the entry portal to the exit portal without dying. This will start off quite easy, but soon enough there will be dangerous traps and enemies to tear you apart. Every level also contains a few of your abducted friends trapped in orbs, waiting to be rescued. They will be in harder to reach places, and sometimes you'll have to beat a timer to get to them before it runs out.After beating a number of levels, you will unlock extra hard 'containment levels'; they are extra hard challenges to test your skills. But if you manage to complete them you will unlock additional octopuses to play with. And each rescued octopus will come with a special skill (for example, extra float time, or a short range teleport).The variation in levels will keep this game from going boring too fast, and each world is also accompanied with great music. Add to this that you can probably get this for almost free during sales, you'll probably get your money's worth.			"

												The game looks cute, has nice sound design and, from what I could see, has a pretty formulaic, but nicely done gameplay based on two core mechanics. On land it's non-violent platforming: you jump around, while gravity attracts you to the nearest surface, dodging as everything is trying to kill you. Underwater it's thrust-based swimming, careful and fast navigation of mazes and, again, dodging as everything is trying to kill you. This looks like it could be several hours of fun.Unfortunately, the first hour gave me motion sickness, so bad that I had to drop the game. Its screen just keeps rotating, making me dizzy, and I couldn't go past the first few worlds. If you never had any problems like this, give it a try, otherwise just look at the trailer fullscreen and imagining doing this for an hour.			"

												Initial thoughts:I just got this game and it is very good. It gets challenging quickly.There are a few issues I do have. Sometimes the octopus gets stuck when jumping to a ledge from underneath (very common in the water levels) and the effect when switching characters makes it a bit confusing (it keeps switching back and forth, which makes it hard to tell whether you picked a chatacter or not). While I haven't finished it, I do feel rather sad that it only has 60 levels. Will update review as I get more into it.			"
