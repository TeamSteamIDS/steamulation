								First Steam Game ReviewIt has to be said right out of the gate. This is the best Virtual Reality Game that is out right now. It is competitive, online play is amazing and the game is such an enjoyable spin on racket sports.The graphics are perfect, gameplay is smooth and presentation is slick. It blows my mind that a AAA Studio did not make this game. Its just so polished.Do yourself a favor and buy this right now!			"

								(Edit: I'm obsessed with this game now) WOW! this game is one hell of a fun workout... the 3d sound is f**king incredible, its something i have not experienced at this level of accuracy yet in VR.. its faciniating how well this works you can hear EXACTLY where the ball is coming from 360 degrees around you, its like you are truly there in that arena... this is a great challenge and a heck of a blast.. the amount of precise control you have over the ball is amazing, the graphics.. everything... these devs are clearly very talented. i was not expecting this to be so awesome.. this is an extremely polished game and he multiplayer is so much  fun.. there's a good amount of people playing too so you're not waiting more than 2 minutes to find a game. hitting that ball is so incredibly satisfying and if you screw up and dont keep up, you will get closer and closer to loosing, You can recover by hitting the point squares all around you which are constantly changing... and oh is it ever satisfying... this is one of the most polished experiences available right now for the vive. im blown away by this game, Its just awesome fun and i very highly recommend it.

								I feel like VR has a lot of people writing their first Steam review. Well it's my turn now.As VR users know, most content right now relies on the ""WOW!"" factor to be appealing, and games that are still actually fun once the VR magic fades are few and far in between. Racket: Nx is one of the only VR games I played (my VR collection has ~40 games) that is genuinely fun.IMO, this is largely due to the ""power shot"" mechanics. By hitting the ball hard, it is possible to hit many tiles in a line, while the direction of that line depends on the shot's angle and spin. The concept is simple, but being able to hit hard while controlling both aim and spin requires a lot of practice. Very few VR games require any skill from the player, but this element of skill/mastery is what makes most games fun: sports, FPS, RTS, they all get more fun as you play and become better at them.However, because of that, it might not suit everyone's taste. Fortunately there's a demo, so you can see exactly what the game is like. You get more game modes (including multiplayer) in the full game, but you won't need that to see whether you like the game or not.Definitely do try out the demo, this game is what I'm expecting from VR in the next few years.

One of the best VR gamesThis game is one of, if not the most, immersive game I've played in VR so far, and is the only reason I currently use my Vive. The graphics, sounds, arena, and gameplay draws you into the amazing experince that screenshots and video cannot show. I would highly recommend checking out the demo to see how you like it. But speaking about the demo, it has one feature that is not in this version of the game; one which it should. That feature is a local leader board. I personally like to challenge myself to fill up the leader board with scores above a certian point, plus it is really cool to see your increasing scores. There is also something about entering in my three initals which is extreamly satisfying to me. Please bring back local leader boards!! It is a simple feature that you all ready have in the demo!

The developers got an one year plan with updates to bring the game out. Hoperfully they can manage to reach those goals.This game has a lot of potential.			"

								I play a lot of squash, so if the racket/ball physics are not right in a VR game I really notice it. I do not know how they have managed this, but no matter how hard or how soft I hit the virtual ball, the physics are ON POINT - I  never expected to see VR become this accurate so early in its development. It's a fantastic achievement from the combined efforts of HTC and the dev team on this game. Really have to congrat the dev team on this effort, the physics are great and the game looks fantastic. I can;t wait to see Multiplayer get busier and with more game types. VR eSports!!Probably the most polished game in my library and definately in the top 5 ""must show friends"" list.One last point, this game is going to sell wireless packs - end of.			"

								Ok so I’ve had my Vive for about two months now and during that time i have bought or downloaded demos of around 60 titles across both the Vive and Oculus (revive) catalogues...Yesterday I stumbled upon the demo for Racket: NX, i downloaded the tiny file lol and loaded it up for the first time.As soon I was in the game world things felt nice and very responsive and nicely laid out and I kind of felt a little twinge going back to my early days playing in the local arcades in the eighties. That’s the vibe I got. So I load up the demo training level and start to play.After about 30 – 45 seconds of playing I suddenly stopped, quit the game and went and immediately purchased the full version! ITS THAT GOOD LOLThis game is as near as perfect for a Vive right now as any I have so far experienced. I think the learning curve is really nice and gentle and I think the gameplay is simply wonderful.I think this is by far the most value for money and fun VR product I have yet come across and I cannot thank the devs enough for their vision, passion and talent to make such an awesome VR game!Hats off to all those guys and gals who are working on this and the VR community that must have helped shape the game into what it is right now… and to think it can only get better and better!To any who might be in doubt just download the demo, what have you got to lose lol and for the rest, just buy it, it really is great!Peace			"

Early Access Review
								There's a lot to like about Racket:NX.  The graphics are outstanding, the mechanics and physics of hitting the ball are superior to other games I've played.  It's a lot of fun and gets the blood pumping.  Unfortunately there are more things that I disliked about the game than things I did.  For starters, there's almost nothing that tells you what you need to do to play.  I know, I know. Hit ball with racket, right?  Except there are the times and how fast you hit the ball determines a lot of things.  The learning curve is steep, and it took playing through a few times to understand what I was even supposed to be doing.  Then there's the portals.  The devs seem to REALLY love those portals.  Unfortunately they destroy the flow of the game play.  ""Oh here! You have to hit this tile.  Let me surround it with portals that spit the ball back out from another location!""  As the difficulty increases, the game uses the portals to an absurd degree.  Which, maybe some people like, but it leads to the next issue I have.The game favors very slow accurate shots rather than allowing you to really get the ball going around the court.  Because of the aforementioned portals, it becomes nearly impossible later in the game to play fast.  Instead, hitting with any sort of accuracy to avoid the portals means taking single, slow shots, which becomes boring.  I get that the portals are meant to make the game more challenging, but instead they just make it more frustrating by forcing you to play a specific way.  I'm not sure whether to recommend this or not.  I'm just not sure it's worth $20 at this point.  I know it's early access, but honestly I think I'd recommend waiting until they've made some changes.***Update to Review***Because of the passion with which the Devs, who reached out to me after I posted my review, and the Racket:NX community have shown, I continued playing and have 12 hours of gameplay in at this point.  One of the developers suggested that it would take 12 to 18 hours just to master the basics.  Unfortunately, further time playing hasn't changed my mind. And, in fact, only reinforces my belief that the learning curve and increase in difficulty are simply too steep for the majority of players.  While I enjoy a challenge and find many aspects of this game enjoyable, I believe the 12-18 hours required to simply pick up the basics is more than most casual players will want to invest.  I think this game absolutely will appeal to those who want to spend 4-5 hours a day practicing to get to the necessary skill level, but for someone like me who just wants to play a game a couple of times a day as a way to break up my work, it's simply frustrating. As it is an Early Access game, I'll check in with it periodically to see if any changes have been made.***Second Update***I'm changing my recommendation from No to Yes because of the most recent update which improved the physics and, more importantly, added a Zen mode which allows new players to practice without the timer.  I still believe the level progression is too steep, but this is a fun, polished, and addictive game, and with the new features I think it's much more welcoming to new players.			"

								As someone who owns Holoball and Rec Room Paddleball I was wondering if I really need another raquet game. I'm rather glad that devs of Racket: Nx decided to offer a free demo. After playing that for a few minutes it became clear that yes, I do need another raquet game.The level of polish in this game is stunning. The game is beautiful, the sound is crisp, the game is fun in both single and multiplayer with quite an extensive road map. I'm glad to support the devs that clearly know what they're doing. Pick up the demo and if it seems like something you enjoy, grab the full game.			"

								I really didn't think much of this game when I heard of it. Oh, a raquetball-type game? How fun can it really be? Tell that my now completely destroyed but completely ripped right arm. I'm in constant battle between my screaminly aching arm muscles and my want to keep playing this game. The progression of fun goes like this. When you figure out the goal of the game, it's mildly fun. Oh, I can curve the ball by putting a top/bottom spin on it? Cool. Oh what? If I hit it with enough power, the ball will ride along the walls, making it easier to hit targets? Awesome! OH @#%^ MULTIPLAYER?! Highly recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								For a VR game based on a simple premise, I was afraid Racket:NX won't deliver in the long run like the countless 'A class' VR games I possess that either fall short or has promised to provide out of EA. Like many of you hesitant to buy a true esport game due to EA as well as spending money on something with low replayability value thus cringing your money short.Truth be told, at the beginning, I almost believed that was true but even in EA one, Racket:NX shines its magnificent primier of what TRUE ESPORTS can do for you. True Esports is one without seating, where your arena is room scale and you sweat and grind for glory, PHYSICALLY. (On  the one hand, being a fan of esports, I cringe the day MOBAs die off being replaced by VR competitive sports but boy am I glad VR took a healthy active turn for the better)Racket NX feels bland at first and as though the racket, ball, and shiny glowy things are just for show and you keep hitting it like its a toy. Your shots are going wide, your wondering whether your controller is ♥♥♥♥ed or development was stupid. Then, you start noticing sounds coming from different locations and your headphones actually can produce surround quality effects. You realise the ball itself emits a sound and so do the wormholes to indicate where the ball is coming from. After you score some finished sets, you begin to realise you are actually getting better not through mental training but literally both mental and physical training. The ball no longer feels like a toy, it becomes heavy and every location it is in VR IS EXTREMELY VITAL INFORMATION.Your shots start being accurate for once and you realize what happens when you hit the ball too early or too late because even that minute detail...MATTERS. Suddenly you got angry and saw a confident shot, you BLAM the ball in the best position and you realize the white smash speed trail that runs across the wall gaining you multiple hits. Before long, the smash starts becoming a spin. Yes...racket NX turned Tennis, Table, Tennis, Squash and Badminton sideways and puked on all of them by giving players the ability to SPIN!! Summary:Seeing a curving smashed ball clearing a score plate finishing a set? Priceless. What I'm trying to get at is the game's ability to play with physical elements of your body, essentially 'upgrading' your character manually...through YOU, physically, like natural sports. You actually progress through the game by actually being better, physically, no need for ultimates, abilities or mana, your stamina IS YOUR MANA. The cream on top for an esport EA 1? Multiplayer sets! where they essentially took the table tennis, squash doubles play and slam it in this high action impact sports but unlike any sport (since there is no dome arena except in cycling), you can 'snooker' your enemy by giving him a hard ball in the cleared section, which means you need to learn reverse racketing as well.There are many things that you will learn to do while playing this game, and you will never stop learning based on the game's ability to instill natural guides, that is your senses, into every playmaker move you make and that answers its replayability value. The game will make you learn more, its only natural and you will improve no matter how bad you are, that is another reason why I recommend this game as its progression is based on you and it will show you how naturally, you will know how you improve because the reward is instant the moment you feel the haptic feedback as the slow mo edge of your racket swings into vision and that aced smash ball zoning into that score plate breaking the glass of the dome, finishing the set.Good luck to you all racketeers10/10 would have a heart attack again flinging my touch into space for that sweet shot			"

As a tennis player, the feel of the racket and how the ball moves feel strangely perfect. I can definitely see a huge amount of room for mastering dexterity in the game.The biggest downside is that it’s really just a skill based arcade game.

								Racket:Nx feels like a sport that would be popular in the tron universe. It is an tennis like game that puts you in an arena with glowing hexagons you need to hit with a crazy, kinetic, alternate gravity ball. For a VR early access title, it is already super polished. The ball and racket physics feel pretty much perfect (I am not good enough at the game yet to verify this accuratley, but it feels fair for the most part) and the graphics are actually quite nice! It is a pretty simple game, but as polished as job simulator.Play the demo. It show you everything you need to know about the game and probably could be a pretty good tool for showing others VR all on its own. But the full game has many more tricks up its sleeve, and multiplayer if you are into that kind of thing. FYI RIFT OWNERS: It works if you have the touch and a 360 setup. It will require a bit of room to play this thing, so make as much space as you can! "

								For early access, this one is a gem! Graphics are absolutely AAA quality, spatial audio effects are SUPERB - (I play with my speakers mirrored ...bass all the way up - plus earplugs as well.) The rules of the game are fairly straightforward, but the nuances sorely need a tutorial! The solo sets are challenging, and will have you playing again and again to build your skill. This game is now part of my workout playlist.tl;dr: This is what VR is for. "

								Played the demo for good long time. The demo itself was more than some paid games for the VR, so I was thinking what more the actual game could offer on top of the experience I got from demo. Went for it finally and have to say that it is worth the money!You get nice new game modes for single player that add their own little things into the mix to spice things up. Full game felt all new although I played the demo a lot. Zen mode is a nice hurry-free casual mode that gives you that well-known ""one more turn/wave"" feeling. I got the came for casual relaxation and zen-mode hits that spot and gives your shoulders a nice warm-up. Really looking forward for the EA 2 update. Can recommend easily now at update 1.5.			"

								Absolutely loving it, both the single player and multiplayer are great. It is really polished for an early access title completely worth the price. An added note: for those like myself from australia where lag can be deal breaker for online VR games, because you are hitting the ball against the wall (like squash) rather then the opponent) any lag has real no effect on the playability.

								This game is quite polished already in its current state. They just added the ability to play solo while you wait for multiplayer matchmaking which is excellent because the multiplayer is the best part of the game. This game could use a bit more sound polish, more juice with the effects, and more variety in the levels. Overall the game is much better than any of the other VR 'pong' style games because it's more like racket ball or tennis. The skill curve is well tuned and is very accessible but at the same time allows for mastery.			"

Hitting the ball is satisfying, getting a chain going is fun and multiplayer is top notch! The game is pretty basic right now in it's first phase of Early Access, but ranked play, stats, inviting friends and more game modes will come in the future. There is a tight knit fanbase on Discord with really open devs. I can see me splitting up my competitive game time between this and Rocket League.I highly recommend Racket: NX!			"

								I've been waiting for Racket NX for ages since the demo came out.  If you also enjoyed the demo then you'll be glad to hear that nothing fundamental has changed now that it has entered Early Access.The physics feel natural and everything runs smoothly.  I've noticed one bug when trying to select a rematch in multiplayer but other than that the game's very well put together, this isn't an Early Access game that has only been in development for a couple of weeks and I'd be happy if this were the finished product.The graphics are nicely done and you get in-game options to increase anti-aliasing and supersampling.  I tried upping the SS but I felt the improvements weren't that noticeable (unlike a game like Raw Data where SS really makes a difference) and I thought it introduced a bit of lag (Nvidia 970).  I may have been imagining the lag but for this type of game where you need fast reactions it's not worth it just so that the already clear, polished graphics look a little bit prettier.I've had my Vive since June/July and this is the first and only game I've played against others in multiplayer!  It's a lot of fun (who'd have thought) and I didn't experience any lag or choppiness.All in all a great game and straight into my top 3 VR games (to be honest the demo already was :) .			"

								Reviewing from the perspective of ""Early Access 1"". Game feels great, polished graphics and audio. Audio plays a huge part in perceiving what is happening in the game. There are a couple of bugs such as the ball which occasionally gets stuck to a wall, or a ball you can't hit at the start of the game which the developers are aware of and I'm sure are already working to fix. All in all this game has amazing potential and is now within my top 3 VR games - this is an extremely promising start considering it's day 1 of early access. Highly recommend it for the price even in it's current state.			"

I've not tried the multiplayer yet but so far the closest thing I've come to a criticism is I feel like it is missing some killer music to put you into the zone.  I just play my own.

								Absolutely fantastic game, my current favorite out of almost 50 VR titles. The graphics are very polished, and there is incredible 360 degree sound that really adds to the game a lot. The actual gameplay is the best part though, the ball and racket physics feel very realistic and respond the way you would expect them to. There are currently 4 solo sets, the last of which has only been beaten by about 10 people so there is definitely an element of challenge to this game. There is also an arcade mode which just goes on infinitely until you run out of time due to missing too much, and then finally an awesome multiplayer mode. All of these features will be expanded on greatly in the future as it is EA so its a great deal for an amazing game. God i sound like im getting paid but i just love this game and want more people to get to play it because its a blast.			"

								Wow, so addictive, and great physics.  Ball spin, speed, everything.  Looking forward to more modes, more specials, and more powers!!Also, ow, my arm hurts.(I'm an avid tennis and squash player, and this game is like having a futuristic squash court in your living room.  Only better somehow.)			"

								Good visuals, great ball physics, great 3D audio. Has more depth to playing than I expected, took me a few sessions before I slowly gained more control over playing the ball. Great workout, even if a bit lopsided, unless you're ambidextrous (you can switch your playing hand mid-game by pressing the trigger).			"

								Best VR ""Game"" I've played by far. I quote game only because most other options call themselves games but in reality their nothing more than experiences; they have very little if any replay value. Pros:+Amazing Tracking+Realistic Physics+Ability to Apply Spin+Unique Player RepresentationCons:-Occasional Game Ending Bug (I.E Ball Stuck in Wall)-(Alpha 1) Really only one Gamemode-(Alpha 1) No Customization of Player or Levels			"

								I really like this game, but I have a few suggestions:1. I often push buttons on the controller accidentally. It would be very helpful to be able to disable them within the game.2. The dimensions for the racquet don't seem quite right to me. It would be helpful to have more than one choice in racquets.3. More haptic feedback would be nice, at least as an option. "

								VR Sport of the future right here. For Early Access it's very polished and worth getting. Definitely not a complete game yet but the developers seem very active with the community and have a lot of plans moving forward! Excited to play this for a long time! Great game			"

								Fracture on Arcade Saga is a fan favorite at my place. This looked similar so I picked it up and I enjoy this much more than I thought I would. It's more challenging than I thought, but after a few attempts I was finding it more and more rewarding. While Fracture has an arcade feel to it, Racket is a bit more polished with a modern tech feel. One thing I like about Racket is the need for only one controller. I find it useful to keep my free hand on the cable behind me in order to keep my bearings.Once you get down the basics, you'll notice that you can apply a good amount of spin on the ball for some really cool curve shots or shots that travel along the walls hitting multiple tiles. There's an announcer present to keep you informed and to compliment you on exceptional shots. 360 degree sound is your friend in this game. Listening can tell you which direction to go when you can't see your target.So I decided to go into multiplayer. That's where the magic happens. SO fun! You're competing against someone who looks like a bot. Wave hello! You take turns hitting the same ball. It changes color when it's your turn to hit it. It almost has a co-op sort of feel to it. I was only able to play one game, so please add to the player pool. :) Be extra cautious of your boundaries. I had a couple of collisions and I play in a good size area.tl;dr: Very polished, high tech racket sports game that rewards skillful play. Very fun multiplayer. A solid buy for anyone looking for a game to get their body moving.			"

								Wow, this is fun.  Challenging, but fun.  Btw, pressing a button on your left hand, or whichever is invisible, puts the racket in that hand.  And trigger is a tractor beam thing.  Don't know if I missed some ingame tutorial about that, but had to figure that out on accident.Highly recommend.			"

								One of the best games for the Vive right now. After playing the single player demo for a long time and absolutely loving it I finally got a chance to try multiplayer in the full version of the game. This is an amazing experience and really feels like the future of e-sports. Matchmaking works great and there is no lag. The only negative thing right now is that you easily get tangled up in the cable while rotating a lot in the game but hopefully this won't be a problem once the wireless add on for Vive is released.

								I played about 20 minutes of the endless arcade mode.  Good fun and definitely offers something different than Holoball or Cyberpong.  There's a lot more playability here beyond what's offered in the demo.  I use the HTC Vive for cardio and I will definitely be adding this amongst the ranks as a light-moderate intensity exervive game.			"

								This game is absolutely awesome if I may say so! This is like a true sport in VR, and with esport features coming I hope there will be plenty of players, and an active and competitive community. Not all want to play competitively of course, and the game is really fun, I'd say most people who enjoy racket sports to some degree will enjoy this, or if you played other similar games. The physics are incredible, you have extreme control over the ball. You can swirve the ball and apply spin like in real life, so it feel very realistic and convincing. This is a really great concept and so far it's really well executed. I have played this a lot, and it is my favorite VR game at the moment. That is because I love sport games, and this is like really long membership in a virtual sports club, and for only a small price I have all the facilities needed to practice and play other people at any time I want. I love playing sports and competition in real life, and this adds a very covinient extra option.I play on the Rift, and the tracking for high speed movements is bad, but I can still play and is quite competitive on the leaderboards, where I've been in the top 10 most of the time. Other than that it works, and it's highly recommended even if you have a Rift, just know that it's not officially supported so we are just lucky that there isn't any issues.			"

								Extremely polished tennis-/squash-inspired game that not only nails the graphics but also the physics (in contrast to other games such as #SelfieTennis where the ball goes through the racket all the time). Compared to the previously available demo, the first EA release has gained multiplayer and a variety of single-player modes. The game also has (equally nicely done) settings that can be used to really ramp up the graphics quality (AA and supersampling), even though it looks really good compared to some other games even at default settings. Highly recommended!			"

								Really enjoyed the demo for this.  The game is very polished and looks great in VR.  It really does feel like a finished game already, even though it has a lot of features that are ""coming soon.""  Things I would like to see implemented however:-Option to mute the commentator (it really annoys me)-Option to mute microphone in multiplayer			"

								So you've tried table tennis is VR, you've tried holoball.. You think ""I don't need this game too...""  Think again, this game is awesome!  Best of the racket games available, this is like Holoball 3.0 with excellent multiplayer!  Can't wait till they have ranked multiplayer also.  A must have if you have ever enjoyed a racket game (real or virtual) in your life.			"

								I wanted to like this game, but after playing for a bit I just couldn't get into it. Low intensity medium skill gameplay with a harsh starting skill curve until you learn how to play. Multiplayer felt cludged in and didn't really seem interesting at all. I expected a fast paced challenging game, but I got a game where your hits are fairly slow and dull when playing well, and missing meant waiting for the ball to come your way again. I feel like the game would have been better if there was less of a focus on 360 play, and the devs instead worked on making getting hits as fast and satisfying as possible.			"
