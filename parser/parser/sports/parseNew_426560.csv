												I like it. Its very similar to PokerStars program. Its a little even better than poker stars cuz it has beter disigne, but thats it. Bigest problem is what you cant withdraw your money but you can deposit... Well this is stupid and i dont like it... If you are gambling you are risking to get money and to lose, but not to win for nothing and to lose for wining... What?!So its another P2W game ? Its not even real gambling cuz you cant withdraw your money... I would like to withdraw my money (chips) to steam wallet and that would be very intresting to play. Or to play with iteams to risk to lose them and to get some money and ect... Well thats what im calling gambling.I hope it will get withdraw option later... If its going to be changed im going to rewrite my review. 4/10 cuz you cant win right now only to lose some time or even to lose your real money... :(			"

												In 2012 PokerStars (by far the largest poker website in the world) struck a deal with the U.S. Depatment of Justice to acquire Full Tilt. In 2014 Amaya Gaming purchased PokerStars and hence Full Tilt.So Full Tilt now is FAR DISTANCED from it's original owners (who were a bunch of crooks, no doubt).Why I wouldn't reccomend this.... Because it I think it's silly to play poker online for ""funny money"". ESPECIALLY when if you run out of chips you have to purchase more play chips with REAL money!			"

												I like Poker.This is Pay to gamble. Yeah, you won't be able to play if you don't pay first.But if you actually ""win"", you can't withdraw any money.There are actually some online poker games that don't require real money, but if you like poker, you know that you need to -look- at the other players.So if you're going to gamble, gamble in real life.Don't pay for this.

												UK review:Playing with fake money is quite fun. It's good to have a multiplayer poker game on steam.But the game includes gambling for real money too and I don't think it belongs on steam. There's something seedy about real money gambling and if nothing else I don't want steam to end up filled with tons of gambling games in addition to the shovelware and weekend code projects that's already flooded the store			"

												AVOID THIS GAME. FIrst, the game itself is badly designed. and the players on it are really really terrible. To the point that not only will you not learn anything related to poker, but it will also introduce bad habits in your playing method. Second, this is for play money... by making you BUY *play money*. There are better ways to learn the game.			"

												So we're letting scammers (Chris Ferguson & Co), whose domain was at one point seized by the FBI, advertise their shady product on Steam? I'm talking about an organization that the U.S. Justice Department filed a civil complaint against for allegedly running a Ponzi scheme, and this is getting the stamp of approval from Valve - one of the most respected video-game businesses out there? This is perhaps the biggest example of why Steam Greenlight is flawed like a bottomless bucket. Get it out of here!More information:https://legitorscam.org/full-tilt-poker-is-a-scam/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576582741398633386https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg "

Originally posted by Wikipedia:United States v. Scheinberg, 10 Cr. 336 (2011), is a United States federal criminal case against the founders of the three largest online poker companies, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Cereus (Absolute Poker/Ultimatebet), and a handful of their associates,[1] which alleges that the defendants violated the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) and engaged in bank fraud and money laundering to process transfers to and from their customers.[1] A companion civil case, United States v. PokerStars, et al., 11 Civ. 2564 (2011),[2] includes Full Tilt and Cereus as defendants and seeks the recovery of forfeiture equaling approximately $3 billion in assets belonging to the companies.Yes, that's right, the devs of this game are literally criminals. They were forbidden from having real money pay. Guess what though? They lied. It's on here. On top of all of that it's not even real gambling because you can't withdraw it. Avoid it at all costs and report to the local authorities.			"

												OK so me and my friend have been waiting for a poker game for some time, something not too shaby and to show off my poker skills to hammer my friend to the ground. Saw this game today and downloaded it 50mb? alright alright lets get into a game quick time, a few seconds pass then i started to play, created an account then made my self some penguin which looks high and i progress towards the browsing of the tables for blackjack, found some game ignoring any instructions (who even reads instructions?) before i hopped in, my friend was outta it just like the time he smoked one Pound of weed within a day and had no idea where the hell he was, the browsing menu, what browing menu? i said ♥♥♥♥ it and 'tried' to hop into this table i have been waiting on, some pop-up menu appeared asking for my details to actually play like CMON all i want is to play a game of poker to prove my pro status towards anyone who comes against me. shambles.

												It's the same client you can download from their .net site (most pokersites use .net for playmoney and .com for realmoney). You get 1000 playmoney and you can get 1000 more when it's gone for free. If you want to play higher playmoney stakes you have 2 options: 1 - Grind it up with your 1000 starting bankroll2 - Buy playmoney chips.But why would anyone buy playmoney chips for real money? Or why would you wanna play with playmoney? Here is my advice:Just start playing with real money! You can sit at a realmoney table for as low as $ 0,80 at the 1 and 2 cent blind tables. Realmoney tables also plays a whole lot different than playmoney tables, it's almost uncomparible. If you wanna learn to play poker better do it at a real money table. There are many poker affiliate sites (just google) that will give a small bankroll for free. That way you can learn poker on realmoney tables without actually risking anything ! If you lose it all, it doesn't matter, cause you didn't spend any money. And if you are good enough to be winning, than you have found a new profitable hobby.So, pay to play playmoney poker or get free money and play real poker?I'm wondering how much money steam got from FTP to put this in the store.

												Funny, how all the people are crying about spending real money on a poker site and that it's gambling. Guys, poker is a sport like chess, some are good some are bad. Or what do you think how players like Phil Hellmuth won so much bracelets at the WSOP? Definitely not because he had so much luck, it's skill. Sure, when you go all-in with every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand, you gamble. And playing with real money is part of the game. So get used to it. Some other people crying about that the site is owned by scamers like Howard Lederer and Chris Ferguson. That's not the truth. Pokerstars bought and reopened Full Tilt and all players who got scamed by the old owners got there bankroll back. So please, don't spread lies around. Full Tilt is a trustful pokersite, owned by the biggest pokersite in the world. They don't need to scam, they earn enough money by the rake you produce while playing.			"

												I Love Hold'em and I'm good at it so I like full tilt, pokerstars, bovada etc. etc.This is the most fun visually since you get redonk avatars. Its one of the first well known poker software shown on several tv. shows like Two Months Two Million, or any WSOP shirt or any Shirt on a Pro in any professionally advertised setting. The point is that this is a classic, I don't know if its the 'best', but its fun, just don't spend real money on FAKE PLAY chips. Although I wish I could play with real money, since i know i could nom some fish and make a pretty penny, but I'll settle for having fun.			"

You never forget how to ride a bicycle.Talking about this game, it's simply a poker app from a famous site; if you download it from here, you can launch it from steam, that's all. Note that, you'll need to create a Full Tilt account.There are many games of poker, but honestly if you play it offline it doesn't make any sense at all. Try the real one.Edit: looks like nowadays here you can play with virtual chips only. No more real money earnings.			"
