												First thing is first, yes, the Steam version of the game does not come stock with Ferrari or Porsche cars. This is a licensing issue and Steam is not trying to screw you over. However, you can easily return Ferrari and Porsches to your game by updating it and installing the No-CD patch (Note: Steam version is already No CD, you still need the patch though to get Ferrari and Porsche to work). On to the game. It's a very old game, true, but the physics are outstanding and with mod added content like cars and tracks you'll find the graphical experience to be pleasant enough to not be distracting and when you're in the moment it's very easy to forget how dated the game looks. The AI is like all AI: terrible. They can run real life lap times and generally speaking they're fairly competent -but- they are absolutely terrible at racing off the racing line. This isn't unique to GTR2 or the GMotor engine, it's an industry wide issue. It's AI, you deal with it, and it's not too bad at the end of the day.Other things to note: 1. The FFB is amazing once tuned properly for your wheel. It's horrible if it's tuned wrong. Take some time to set it up right.2. If you're using a controller, you'll find that the game is just as enjoyable and just as playable3. If you're using a keyboard, you can STILL be competitive with the right sensitivity adjustments. The game is that versatile, but obviously your experience will be the best with a wheel.4. The 24H day/night cycle works as intended and is gorgeous. Sunsets blind, nights are dark. 5. The weather system leaves something to be desired. There is no dynamic weather to speak of, though there is a mod that corrects this. When the tracks are wet it's more like ice and more often than not TCS isn't enough. 6. Most importantly, this game has a STRONG modding community. Is there a major track out there you want in your game? Someone has created it. Is there a series you want to race in? Someone has created it. The only major series absent to my knowledge are the latest models of NASCAR, but this is a road racing game so what do you expect?EDIT:I figured I should also mention how it compares to other games. The next generation of sims is coming out as we speak so it might seem weird to pick up an 8 year old game. I feel that Assetto Corsa is likely going to be GTR2's spiritual replacement (Not that I have anything against pCars, or that there is anything wrong with pCars) in terms of the ""sim"" quality and possibly modding community. But it isn't there yet. As it stands this is IMO, the best sim out there that you can buy overall, and it's largely thanks to the modding community. If you don't feel comfortable modding, then it's still a great sim with the 2004 GT championship, but I would advise picking up AC or pCars instead (once they release in full that is). The maturity of the mod community is what makes GTR2 what it is today, because they've pushed the Gmotor engine to its limits. Being said, AC looks better, handles better, and has arguably better FFB. It's too early to say how the career mod, modability, and AI are in comparison.If you're comfortable modding, then this is and will continue to be the best sim out there until either AC, pCars, or rfactor2 builds up its mod community. If so, buy the game and head over to nogripracing.com and see what I'm talking about.			"

												I've ran the championships a run once, currently working on my second run-through of the game. The time I've clocked in this game is closer to 40-ish hours than the 24 it says; the game launches a launcher (for file permissions) before it launches and when the launcher closes, Steam no longer says I'm in-game. ANYWAY. Right, review time.PROS - GRAPHICS. For a game made almost 9 years ago, the graphics hold up well. Vehicle liveries are clear and easy to read, cockpit decals are clear, and you can read the speed off your in-dash display. (All this, of course, can be downscaled, or in the case of the in-dash display, completely turned off.)  - REALISTIC DAMAGE. Run your engine too hard and it'll blow out. Hit a wall wrong and your splitter may come off which will make your vehicle tend to understeer, or you might have a blowout which will cause the vehicle to pull to that side. Your engine may even catch fire if you're running it at too much throttle. (This can be turned off.)  - TUNING. You can tune the cars almost how you'd like (within reason, of course!) and the minor differences in tuning can be felt on the track. The game includes native support for MoTeC, a powerful tool used in real-world motorsport, to be used for track data acquisition. (Sadly, the MoTeC acquisition is not live - you can't have it on one monitor and showing live changes in speed, steering wheel angle, etc.) Note that MoTeC is not included with the game, and you should either be familiar with the tool or search for a GTR2 worksheet, as well as how to use the data in tuning your vehicle before it will be useful to you at all.  - GOOD AI. Most of the AI will follow a realistic racing line, including when passing a wreck under yellow, overtaking or allowing someone to overtake, or recovering from a wreck. You can even adjust how strongly the AI performs (I believe it goes 75% strength to 125%?) as well as how their racing style is (Timid, Clean, Realistic, Aggressive, Psychotic I believe the choices are).  - DAY/NIGHT CYCLE. This is surprisingly one of the things I like most about GTR2. The game includes a day/night cycle which you can adjust the speed on in the menus. It goes from realtime (24 hours == 24 hours) all the way to 60Ã— (24 minutes == 24 hours) and the opponent vehicles will turn their headlights on at dusk and off at dawn.  - WEATHER EFFECTS. This isn't as surprising considering many modern games have it, but remember: this was made in 2006. It comes with basic rain effects (road mist, rain fall, rain splash on windscreen) and rain strongly affects traction in 4 stages, shown by the track condition with increasing amount of traction loss: Dry, damp, wet, and flooded. You also have 3 different types of tyres: Slicks (with 3 degrees of compound softness), intermediates, and wet tyres (with 2 degrees of compound softness).   - MODDING. The game makes itself easy to mod. Want a new livery for that car you've been eyeing? Go online, find a template and make one. You don't even need to place it in GTR2's archive files if you don't want to, the game will load loose files. You can add custom music as well (note: it plays in order of filename, 0-9 then A-Z). All-in-all the bits above are what make the game great.  CONS  - PROGRESSION. While this isn't a bad thing in itself, the way it pulls it off leaves a lot to be desired, and could have been worked much better. In order to unlock tracks, you need to win different championships (under the CUSTOM tab in the championships menu) and in order to unlock the different championships, you need to - of all things - get the gold awards in the driving school levels. NOTE: This can be bypassed by placing a blank file titled SDNDTG.DYN in the root GTR2 folder.  - NOT UPDATED. There is an updated patch of the game which solves some issues, such as Hockenheimring's AI not turning off their pitlane speed limiter after exiting pitlane, which was not released on Steam. The version you get is incompatible with versions using the most updated version, unless you manually patch the game.  - NOT ALL CARS INCLUDED. Ferraris and Porsches are included with the game, however due to the Steam game's design you would need to manually do some stuff to the files in order to drive them - I'd go into detail but it's not permitted by the Guidelines, so if you must know, you can search it. If you do NOT do this, some championships are cut from the game, and any Porsche or Ferrari you see will be from a manufacturer titled ""Gray MTR"" and unable to be driven outside of tutorial, or if you are able to get the game to glitch where you're able to drive.  - TOUCHY HANDLING. If you play with an XBox 360 controller as I do, you might be surprised in that the deadzone is virtually nonexistant. You have to gently nudge the joystick in order to take a turn, and speed-sensitive steering only goes up to a certain amount. Not a major con, and some people certainly may prefer this driving style over the traditional ""smash joystick against detent"" style on consoles, but it certainly takes some getting used to. OVERALLThis game has aged quite well over the years from what I can see. All-in-all it's a decent game, though I would NOT recommend it if you prefer more arcade-styled racing games, such as Burnout: Paradise, Forza Horizon et al. I've got to give it a solid 8 out of 10 personally.Edited 2015-04-08 23:27Z to fix a fragmented sentence.Edited 2015-04-08 23:30Z to re-organize a sentence in the damage section.Edited 2015-12-31 00:59Z to redo lead sentence in the progression section. Lead sentence no longer implies I feel negatively about progression in simulator racing games.			"

												It is the most realistic racing sim I've driven bar GPL, so I recommend it heartily, BUT, and that's not a small but, with several caveats.  Right off the bat, it's difficult.  It's not unfairly difficult, but it's certainly frustratingly hard, so stay away from the game unless you are willing to sink in hours and hours practicing your skills and tuning your setups.  Second, it's no looker.  It was brilliantly good when it first came out (Hell, I remember drooling over the first GTR's graphics back when I played it) but these days, the whole game looks rather flat and boring.  There are mods to fix the lighting, skybox and both car and track textures, but even after all the effort it will show its age under all the makeup.  On a bright note, the game has widescreen support, although the menu UI is stretched.  Third, it's not the complete deal; Porsche and Ferrari cars are not in the game due to licensing.  You can circumvent this, again, through mods/cracks but really, it's kind of a letdown.  Fourth, you should probably not really bother unless you have a wheel and pedals.  Playing the game with the keyboard is torture, and controller support is weak.  It's not XBOX controller friendly out of the box (which is fairly normal considering it was released in 2006) and setting comfortable deadzones and sensitivity for a controller can be incredibly frustrating.  I was never able to achieve a perfectly comfortable XBOX controller setup, but to save you time the best I could get was: Deadzone 18, Sensitivity 0%, Speed Sensitive Steering 60%, and finally Steering Lock 8 degrees (in car setup).  With these out of the way, and if you are still reading this, you are in for some incredibly tight and satisfying racing, which is a steal for the money this title costs.			"

												How good is this? well you can't quite smell the burning rubber and red hot brakes or the burning clutch, but thats about all that's missing.  One of the best old-school racing sims before the new generation. Still plays very well today. Another classy SimBin production with pleasing physics, cracking sound, pretty goodAI, and a host of tracks. Add to this the great community surrounding this and its is similar stable of games with all the mods, addons, tracks and cars (and yes, some online action if you want to join up on some forums and fiddle a bit).  Well worth any racing sim enthusiast adding to your collection.  Get some of the realistic engine sound mods, put some headphones on, max the sound to 11 and enter petrol-head heaven, and its cheaper than crack :)			"

												Great game if you just got a wheel and looking to get into sim racing. This will teach you some good fundementals of driving. It's also old but it holds up well. It's made by SimBin so you know the physics are great. The mods are where the game really shines. You get a good selection of GT cars from the base game but there's mods out there for almost every racing series you can think of. And they're compatitble with RACE 07 and rFactor.It might be a bit discouraging at first when you struggle to keep the car on the race track, but don't give up! Do the tutorials. They won't turn you into Michael Schumacher but you'll know how to drive decently.Heavily recommend a wheel.			"

												Where do I begin? I love this racing simulator so much, I've decided to write a review about it (Which I RARELY do.)I'd imagine the best place to start is a pro an con list. -PROS -Amazing AI (Possibly the best in any sim game)-Great physics-Great modding community-Large core selection of cars, classes, and tracks-Tutorial for new people (Not me, but a good feature for them)-Optimized engine-Amazing cockpit detail (For the time, and still pretty good for my standards)-Great setup menu if you know how to use it-Some of the greatest sounds in a sim (Next to Assetto Corsa) -CONS -Rather dim lighting, but still good for the time.-AI doesn't seem to make many mistakes (For me atleast)-I've heard that the multiplayer commute isn't very good, I've tried getting into a room, but there was none.That seems to put a perspective on some details I've noticed.Now gameplay and fun factor. With and without mods, I've had a great time with this game. The very competitive AI puts a racing feel, like you are actually racing real people. The AI also has no rubberband factor. (if you don't know what that is, look it up) So, is it fun? Yes, Most definatly. Final Thoughts Do I recommend this game? Yes, I really do. If you didin't get the point yet, it is the greatest sim on the market, and is older than most of them. You can have fun racing alone, and if your friends have this game and you want to play together, run a dedicated server and have him join your server.If you have read this all the way through, Kudos to you.

												Although old GTR2 is still one of the best racing sims out there.GTR2 is based on the 2003/2004 seasons of the FIA GT Championship, and its base content includes 25 cars & 15 track locations used in those seasons. The game has nice graphics, good sounds, handling of cars is very good, precise & intuitive, controller support is good, and there's lots of mod content available.Graphics can be slightly better than rFactor depending on the mod/track used, and replays generally look better than rFactor. The game only requires 512MB of video memory when run on the highest settings, so even if you have an old PC you should be able to get good graphics in this game.Controller support for Xbox360 controller is pretty good, the default controller settings work well, require precise inputs without being frustrating.Gameplay is very good, there's driving school, 24hr races, championships, or you can simply create custom race weekends with cars & track of your choice, being able to restrict AI to use only specific cars instead of allowing all base cars can make races more interesting imo. There's also weather & time change in all tracks, both of which increase the challenge and make races even more interesting.Base content might seem kind of slim with only 25 cars & 15 track locations, but mods more than make up for it. GTR2 has a lot of mod content (not as much as rFactor, though), there's lots of tracks & cars that can be found on the internet, and the large amount of mod content combined with the excellent gameplay can provide lots of replay value.I bought Race 07 before buying GTR 2 thinking Race 07 might be better than GTR 2 because of the larger amount of base content. Race 07 is a great game imo, but I think overall GTR2 is better, better gameplay, better car handling & controller support, more mod content, more replay value. Even if you already have Race 07 GTR2 is still worth buying.GTR2 imo is a must have for fans of sim racing, great gameplay, low price, lots of mods, and it can run fine even on old PCs. Highly recommended.			"

												This one stands out for me from the other (and equally epic!) SimBin series in that there is some great mods out for it.  So if you get bored with the oodles of tracks and cars (with the various offical add-ons) you can always load up the Corvete Meeting Mod in GTR 2 and drive your old school C4 Vette around! Also, this title works with everythng! TrackIR? No problem!  Eyefinity? Easy! Steering wheels and HOTAS? Absolutely!  Stereo3d (S3D) with IZ3d, Tridef and AMD3D? All verified and awesome!How about Simcraft professional racing Sims? Yes, motion and VR/HMD headtracking support?  All baked in.I've played this using all the tech stated and I can tell you that despite the latest eye-candy rich sims out there, I keep coming back to this one.  The hardware requirements are very low by todays standards and will run on almost anything.  It is nice though to crank everything on MAX with a decent modern GPU.  High fraps and it still looks very good IMHO.			"

So you can't do much about the problem. SadWith the worst behaving cars (e.g. Toledo) you basically have to wait......until the front of the car is inside 20Âº in relation to the following straight. Then you can apply throttle.still, a very good and realistic game but I'll stick with rFactorfinal lightening: I saw a review of ""chegster"" he called F1 2012 a sim			"

												I thought I was good at racing games, as I have spent hundreds of hours playing Gran Turismo... Turns out I suck at racing games with a keyboard. Who knew?! (Unless it's Track Mania, I'm beast at that.)What started as an urge to play a racing game, and not wanting to go downstairs and hook up the ps3, I ventured into my library to see what racing games I had, I found this! So here is my totally un-informational review of GTR 2 FIA GT Racing Game. Steam says I've played 0.0 hours, but I spent a few hours on this.First off, that name! It could be shorter. But none the less. If you are someone that is looking for a racing Simulator, you will probably like this. This game has menus and settings everywhere! I spent almost an hour looking through menus before I even got to race once! Once I figured some of it out and got to actually race, I had fun! I got to race in a Lambo, Viper, and a Corvet! I never won in any race, but I had a blast just racing!Now there is 1 HUGE problem I had with this. The graphics. According to the game, my PC can NEVER run this game on Medium or higher graphical settings, which is bull cause I've played way more graphical demanding games than this, and play them on High-Ulrta-Max settings. At first I didn't care and just raced a few times. I gone back later to attempt to change the settings to play the game on higher settings, but that just broke the game completely. The game could no longer even open after I changed the settings... Which was a shame. I would have liked to have played a bit more.I recommend this only to people that like Racing Sim games. If your someone that just wants to jump in and race, this is not the game for you! This game does require work and know how to do things in it. I would guess there is better racing sim games out there, I just don't know many, or haven't played many.			"

												No shame in admitting I am still a racing sim noob, HOWEVER I find immense enjoyment in learning how to drive fast.This sim has an extensive racing school to teach you everything you will need to know in order to be competitive on the track, it has a magnificent selection of GT cars (Lamborghini, Ferrari and Maserati, yum yum), and it still looks really really good for a title that is almost 10 years old.A must-have for every sim fan out there.10/10 would keep on trying to learn how to race with an old, sub-par wheel.

												I remember playing this when I was 7 or 8. The good thing about this game is how realistic it is. The engine sounds great and the car damage looks realistic. There is a bug where you can't control your car after touching the wall. Even if you reset the car, you still can't control it at all, so you have to restart the race. Not sure if it's the point of the game but most likely it shouldn't be. This one isn't really about the gameplay but for some reason, Steam won't fully keep track of how much hours I've played on this game. It only keeps track for 2 seconds after pressing play. Overall, I enjoy playing this game and I will never forget about the BMW M3 Motorsport. I love driving that car the most.			"

												A fantastic game that costs almost nothing. Use Reshade to inject some post processing to your taste to update the visuals. The in cockpit steering wheel can't rotate past around 270 degrees so it's best to turn the wheel off unfortunately.Game features weather, wide array of GT cars from the early 2000s and supports long endurance style racing as that's what it's made for. (Quick races are just as viable.) Excellent. Get it. Great sim.- Excellent mods are also available, The Power & Glory in particular is something that everyone who owns this game should have installed.			"

												How good is this? Well you can't quite smell the burning rubber and red hot brakes or the burning clutch, but thats about all that's missing. One of the best old-school racing sims before the new generation. Still plays very well today. Another classy SimBin production with pleasing physics, cracking sound, pretty goodAI, and a host of tracks. Add to this the great community surrounding this and its is similar stable of games with all the mods, addons, tracks and cars. Well worth any racing sim enthusiast adding to your collection. 10/10			"

												GTR 2 is a great full blown racing simulator, takes all of the realistic details into the game. Practicing, Qualifying, Pit Stops, Tire Wear, etc. Graphics are a little dated but not bad for its age. If you have a retail copy it can be activated on Steam, SimBin was good enough to use the retail cd keys to activate them on steam. The menu music is pretty awesome too.			"

												This game, this game is still boss. Add a load of tracks from around the world, car mods, skin mods from various web sites, and you're away. I still love this game, I ended up buying it twice. This is the only game I've had over 100 cars all racing on the same track, brilliant.This is not an arcade driving game, this is more sim, more like had you actaully have to drive a race car. It isnt full throttle never letting go of power like nfs or grid.You do need to set a dead zone on your pad steering!You do need to search for the fix for the greyed out cars. It's in several reviews!9.6/10			"

												GTR 2 is not a bad game.It is only $8 and it isnt worth it.But i got board of it after 1hr,the AI's are suicidal,the tracks are horribly modeled,you cant drive in the pits and it only has GT cars.No matter what you do u cant get your car to slid out its like an arcade game...The graphics are horrible as well,the sky and tree's are just a real life picture then everything else is 3D.This game has some pro's.-All weather conditions(excluding fog and snow).-Driving school-Porshe(which are all gray because this game didnt get the licence for the steam edition)Those are the pro's.I definitivly do not recomend getting this game,oh,and the music,you can turn on ingame music wich is horrible,but just my opinion.This game did false advertising when i wanted to get it,i was expecting well modled tracks,proper AI and Porshe,i didnt get any of that.I do not recomend getting this game,oh,the multiplayer does not work either.This game is for you if you want a cheap arcade game.And it does not keep track of your time,i have probably 10hrs on record,not 0.01.

It has custom and official championships, and a large number of cars and tracks available right from the start.  I still play this as much or more than any other racing sim on the market.			"

												I love open source games like these. I own this, GT Legends, and RACE 07, and all three were gemstones of my childhood (they still are, I'm only twelve). I love games where you can just do a quick race and drive around in a practice session (that's all I do). Only con is that if you venture into modding the game, you will find that the game can get a little unstable, and it can crash when loading a race if certain mods go wrong. However, I believe that you should still purchase GTR2, GT Legends, and RACE 07 because the price isn't that high. All in all, I think that all three rival Asseto Corsa as seperate games, not even combined. I am eventually going to go and buy Project Cars, I hope it's not as dissapointing as Assetto Corsa was. Out of the three, (back on topic) I think GT Legends is the best. However, I will let the game speak for itself.			"
