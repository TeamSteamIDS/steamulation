												I love this game. I have just lost my mom and mother in-law and my old faithful dog within 3 month period and the only thing that keeps me sane is Super Mega Baseball. The game stands true to every aspect of the real game. The way you can customize is absolutely a laugh a minute. I have put in over 200 hrs. Playing and I don’t look at stopping anytime soon. Great fun and recommended to all ages.			"

												TL;DR: You can tell that every ♥♥♥♥ing part of the game is made with a love of baseballI have been wanting a baseball game on PC for years, and it's no secret to PC gamers who are also huge baseball lovers that there is a huge lack of games for us. Sure, we have OOTP Baseball, but it's not a baseball game. I love it as much as the next sabermetric fan, but I wanted a game to actually play baseball. And then we had RBI Baseball, which was a letdown. So naturally, I was excited when Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings was announced. And now that it's finally here, it feels like after years of being deprived of a good baseball game has finally come to an end.Now, I only really have three complaints about the game, but they're sort of not even complaints at all. More like a couple of things I want added to the game in future updates. Let's get those CONS out of the way first:- Lack of sabermetric statsBaseball fans LOVE stats. We love OPS, WHIP, AVG, and ERA, and I'm glad those ones are in the game, but over the years, baseball has evolved to embrace much more in depth stats. I want to know the WAR, BB/K, ISOP, BB/PA, RC27, and G/F of my players. - Lack of customizing optionsI want some of those Chris Archer stirrups. I want my player to look like that 20-something Jaden Smith-looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. My nasty slider needs the player look to match.- Lack of online multiplayerI want to have my Harry Butts dominate another man's bat. I mean, he has a 1.45 ERA, 11.4 K/9, and .122 OPP AVG. Let me show him off.And now we get to the PROS list:-The game is beautifulThe player models are clean and fun. the graphics are vibrant. And the stadiums. Oh the stadiums are gorgeous. - The gameplay is funIT'S BASEBALL. IT'S INSANELY FUN.- There are no special pitches or swingsTake notes, Backyard Sports. Nobody likes to play against a pitcher who makes the ball corkscrew while it digs underground and pop up only to burst into flames and then into the batter's♥♥♥♥♥ Super Mega Baseball is cartoony, but it's never cartoony in an unfair way.- Ego difficulty sliderI love this. You don't have an option of easy, medium, and hard difficulties to play on. You have an actual slider that sets the difficulty in small amounts.- The names of the playersYou know the names you think of when you think of baseball? Babe Ruth, Clayton Kershaw, Sandy Koufax, Wade Boggs, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle, Rollie Fingers, Gaylord Perry etc. They're baseball names. Their parents looked at them and thought, ""Bob doesn't sound like a name for a future Hall of Fame catcher. Let's name him Buster."" Well, in this game EVERY player has a baseball-sounding name. It's awesome. -It's a game-It's a baseball game-It's a baseball game on PC-It's a fantastic baseball game on PCWHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW. BUY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.9 out of 10			"

												10/10 would KO a batter again!This game is one of the most surprising titles I have ever picked up on Steam.I got it under the assumption that this would probably be a super simplified game with the bare minimums by how it looked and hoped for the best...What I ended up buying was not only an amazingly fun and addictive baseball game, but a game with one heck of a lot more depth to it than you would assume by judging this game by it's cover.=== Gird your loins ye who read the full review below ===The batting in this game, completely on point.  The physics feel super tight and even in higher difficulties you don't feel like you're getting cheesed when you ground out or pop the ball a mile high.  If you swing on that pitch down in the strike zone and haven't reacted quick enough you know damn well you're going to ground out.  Everything feels very organic and proper as far as how the ball reacts. There are two different types of swings (plus bunting) : power and contact. You are also able to check your swing with both styles. For the most part the same can be said about the AI as far as their hitting goes; If you make your pitches and place them well you will get your outs and K's.  Again, feels very realistic despite it's cartoony graphics and light-hearted attitude.The pitching, my favorite part.  You have a plethora of pitches (8) to choose from, which is way more than enough considering every pitcher has the same choices. The pitches available are:  4 seam fastball (so-called Meatball), Cut fastball, 2 seam fastball, Slider, Screwball, Curveball, Changeup and a Forkball which is like a split finger fastball or Sinker as far as the movement goes.  You perform the pitch by first aiming for the spot you wish the ball to begin it's trajectory and then following the break of the ball.  You attempt to come as close to the break point marker (which appears after you start your windup) with your aim marker.   The closer to that spot you get the higher quality a pitch you perform. As with batting you have two different pitching styles available to you. Normal pitching and Power pitching. It is a very well done and fun system which I find more interesting than the common methods found in other baseball games like power sliders and such.   As much as I appreciate and love the pitching in this game, I also feel it is an area of the game that has a lot of potential to be made better.  Not so with how you perform your pitches but that each pitcher should have their own set of pitches. Along with that system it would more easily open the doors to having upgradeable pitches for each of the pitchers as well.If you're familiar with baseball games and the game of baseball itself there is not much to go over with baserunning and fielding so I will not say much here.   The fielding feels good but I can see people getting a little frustrated with how quickly (or slowly in this case) your fielders will move.  It feels very laborious at first but it is something you get used to and everyone's on the same playing field in that regard for the most part.  You can make awesome diving plays if you time it correctly as well as jump walls to reel in those homers you'd all but given up on.The baserunning, less to say here than the fielding.  Pretty much your basic baseball game here except you cannot be picked off on base by the pitcher.  The game uses an adaptive method, if it notices you are stealing a lot of bases it will start to give your runners less and less of a lead off.  That is one point of the game where it is lacking and unfortunately simplistic.The depth.Yes, depth! In case you haven't been convinced so far that there is more to this game than meets the eye, hopefully this will make it a bit more evident.As you play the game with your team in season mode you will be able to hire staff to help your team on their way.   Each member of staff you hire will have 3 modifiers to offer your players in four different categories.  Gear vendors, Trainers, Coaches and Stylists.  Your players will start out with a few slots open and available to have modifiers placed in and their stats will improve according to the type of modifier you set.  Each player can have up to a maximum of 7  slots for different types of modifiers that will be made available as you play through your seasons.  Any extra slots and bonus modifications you have done will persist from season to season with that team and you will eventually be able to make your players superstars, for lack of a better term.There is a bit of strategy behind this feature and you will also see the opposing teams players' improving in the same way as well.  In some cases even quicker than your own players if you did not approach the proper staff or applied your modifiers poorly.  For this part of the game I would recommend looking at SMB websites forums for a more in-depth description of the system itself just for a better understanding.There is also a decent amount of statistics in the game including (but not limited to ;) ) BABIP, AB/HR ratios, walk and XBH percentages, OPS/OBP/Slugging, Total Bases, etc.  And if by chance you don't know what any of these actually mean it is described in game.One more thing that adds to the depth of this game is the highly adjustable and customizable difficulty system, called ""Ego"".You can adjust the difficulty across the board, or you can go into what's called Ego mode and adjust the difficulty based on the positions you're playing.  For example, you could have batting and pitching at 50 Ego, but fielding and baserunning at 80 Ego so the game doesn't hold your hand as much for those bits.  It makes it very easy to find a difficulty which you feel comfortable playing at and that gives you a good run for your money sometimes.    The difficulty goes all the way from 1 Ego, through to 99 Ego.  Anything above 60-70 Ego (once you've gotten comfortable with how the pitches look and move) will give people who are familiar with baseball games a good challenge while at the same time feeling like it's a proper competition.An unfortunate truth that has been a big disappointment to many about this game is that there is no online multiplayer, nor is there plans for there to be in this game.   With any luck this game will have a sequel, which, from what I hear and have understood, online multiplayer will be one of the priorities for that as it has (quite understandably) been one of the most requested things by the community.   If by chance you happen to have friends within couch distance the game does have one of the most fun co-op playstyles I have seen for local multiplayer and a baseball game in general.If you have stuck around to this sentence and read through the whole review I have written up, I commend you, and hope that this has given you a good idea to make a well informed decision.  This game and the team behind it truly deserve all the support they can get for this game.  It has amazing gameplay somewhat hidden behind it's cartoony facade.Thanks for reading. :)			"

												Do you want a realistic, fully-featured, MLB-licensed game? Go play The Show. Do you want a super-detailed simulation of life in the front office? Play Out of the Park Baseball. Do you want a damn fine arcade-style baseball game that's easy to pick up but difficult to master, has insanely fun pitching mechancis, and a fine-tuned difficulty setting to ensure the AI is always giving you a good fight? Play this.			"

												TL;DR - I've been having a lot of fun with this game. But it's not an MLB Simulator.Pros:- Fun baseball game. It has all the essentials to make it fun, including smart controls.- Organic, real feeling physics. There is no ""cheat spot"", you have to adjust your timing for every swing, and getting a tater feels like an accomplishment.- Original difficulty system. Make your games as easy or difficult as you want, very precisely.Cons:- No in-game save. Once a season game starts, you need to finish it or it will be recorded as a loss.- Some stats are weird, like, since there are no errors recorded, if you hit a grounder to first and the 1B flubs it... it's still a base hit. I understand why they do it this way, it just feels wrong to get a hit that way though.Bottom line, it's a baseball game in PC, and it's fun. Stick with OOTP for realism, and grab this to blast that hanging slider over the left field fence!			"

												A great sports game for PC, which seems to be somewhat of a rare thing.  There is no MLB license but what you have are great looking stadiums, lots of stats, and excellent gameplay.  The graphics in general are very good and the cartoonish style and names of the players give them character.  Hitting and pitching is what the game is all about and its very fun...fielding is there but not as in depth.  You can train your players, manage your team during a long season, and compete for leaderboard scores.  One of the best features is the Ego system which is a difficulty setting (from 1 to 100) that increases your points the higher level you play at.  I play at 50 right now after starting out lower...50 is where it starts to get difficult and I have close games...mostly losses but the system encourages you to get better slowly which is nice.			"

												The game is alot of fun! It's taking me a while to get used to the controls, I'm now really good at batting though and can hit homeruns quite often, the graphics are real nice, very bright and ""cartoon-like"".I can confirm the optimization is good, the game runs really smooth 58fps constant with everything on the highest settings, 58fps seems to be the locked framerate on this game, this is run on a 960 GTX and an i7 3.4Ghz but to be fair I can't see why a much lower system would have any difficulty running it.Only downsides, I am using a 360 controller and it appears the game has no ""deadzone"" so if your analogue stick doesnt sit exactly back in the middle when you release it then the ""aim"" will move into the direction the stick is slightly set into which is a bit annoying.A little bit of deadzone input into the game would be nice.And.... No online multiplayer Booooooooo This game deserves multiplayer, It would be a great addition!Overall I am really having fun with this game 8/10			"

												Only played a little but I wanted to get this out there for people with concerns.  I was deeply worried about the controls as I prefer to use a mouse and keyboard.  In my first little game where I hopped in I had found the controls to be quite pleasant and I felt I was doing well right out of the gate for only my first game.  So in case anyone is worried I found 0 issues with keyboard and mouse controls.As far as the game....its fun.  Has a real nice atmosphere.  Im glad I bought it and Im glad devs are making games like this.Definitely worth the money in my book.			"

												This is a great baseball game that fills the itch quite well. Hitting feels good. Pitching is well done, with lots of options. The base running is okay.It reminds me of Baseball Stars of old, minus some of the customization depth of that old classic. A solid PC baseball game, made with love. Now we need to convince them to make a hockey version of this. Think 70's rough and tough, missing teeth and no hemets.... bloody hits, and broken legs. These guys could do it.			"

												Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Ladies and gents, today in our Super Mega Baseball match between the mighty “Sirloins” and the muscly “Wild Pigs,” it is all going to be about which meat will be the toughest! Now you have to pick who is going to be at the top of the batting order by looking very carefully at your players’ attributes and see who has the highest level of MOJO! If you are pitching first, you will be presented with eight different types of throws and it’s up to you to get your 3 strikes! Depending on what is going on during a particular innings, the tension, the emotion or even the expectation of scoring points might make the batsman tense and sweaty! But wait, the pitcher is as anxious and on top of that he is absolutely buggered with no MOJO left in him/her!Expect to see marvellous dives and acrobatic wall climbing catches executed by fun and cute characters. You can elect to have an exhibition game for the fun of it or jump into a season, choosing how long a season will last - short, medium or long (consisting of 16, 32 and 48 games respectively with play offs). During the season mode, you will be able to hire staff to train your team and hopefully get more wins than losses, and other goodies such as upgrades.I like the player customization due to the fact it simple and straight forward. The perfect KISS principle and you will have fun with this option.In terms of the controls, I would suggest you look at the tutorial. It is well designed and will help you to get the feel of the controls. It will take you some time to master them. After all, plenty of things to do on a Baseball pitch! Also, I would recommend you play with a gamepad. It makes the game more enjoyable.The graphics are cute, fun and the game runs smoothly. Positives: ~~~~~~~~   -	Good, cute and fun graphics-	Nice Audio-	Season option-	Nice and easy player customization-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives: ~~~~~~~~   -	Can’t see any so farSuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings is a well-designed game. Hardcore and casual baseball fans (like myself) will enjoy every minute! It’s fun, it’s hard, and it’s BASEBALL! 10/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Super Mega Baseball strikes a strong balance between the action and presentation of an arcade game and the depth of a sim. The offensive side of things is pretty standard stuff, but it's the pitching that has a surprising amount of meat on its bones. Lots of pitch types, a twitch-based cursor-and-target system, needing to mix things up to keep the hitter guessing - it's a wonderful system once you get the hang of it. Fielding is somewhat CPU-assisted (less so at higher difficulty levels) although you can still take manual control of your fielders to chase down fly balls, leap for line drives and dive for ground balls. All of these mechanics are layed out via a helpful in-game tutorial system that works quite well.I really like how the ""Ego"" difficulty system is implemented. It allows you to ease yourself in and gradually increase or decrease the challenge until you find your sweet spot. And I'm very satisfied with the quality of the port - Runs smoothly on my 7870 and has settings for AA (up to 16x), AF and shadow quality as well as Windowed Fullscreen support.SMB is lacking when it comes to varying modes, unfortunately. Exhibition and Season mode is it. Something like a HR Derby or the option to jump right into a playoff tournament would've been nice. There are also only six ballparks, though all six are well designed and full of life. Baserunning controls feel a little awkward at first but I'm certain it's something that will only require a bit of practice. And while there is local co-op, the absence of online multiplayer is disappointing.Despite its shortcomings, SMB's finely-tuned gameplay and charming personality make it a joy to play. Easily the best non-OOTP baseball game on PC since MVP 05, and recommended for both casual and devoted fans of the sport.			"

												So you want baseball.... you want a baseball game with all the thrills, all the spills, and the benches clear brawls.....Well... this game isn't that.. although it is still a pretty fun game to say the least.  The video and screen shots don't really do this game justice..  It's probably the best available baseball game on steam.   I'll list off some pros and cons for this game..Pros.. Good baseball experience, Decent stat keeping,Fast Gameplay,Not too arcady,Adjustable difficulty...Unique take on improving your teamFun yet fairly challanging pitchingCons..Lack of MLB license (although this isn't a deal breaker)Baserunning can be a bit wonky,at times fielding can be a crap shoot, especially on in field grounders..Only about 15 teams,Longest season is 48 games...Lack of trades or Multiple seasonsIn spite of a few flaws I'd still highly recommend this game, it's the best baseball game on steam that you can actually play.   It's just arcady enough to be fun while not detracting away from the game itself..   A nice pick up and play title that will see you burning through a few hours and wondering how you spent so much time playing.Once you find the right difficulty setting the game will keep you really engaged..

												Probably could give a much longer review but I'll just some up the things I love about this1) Replay value        - Many teams to play        - Different length of seasons ( 16, 32, 48 ) + playoffs        - Ego mode, leveling system, and staff (player boosts) allow you to always have a challenge2) Quality baseball mechanics        - Not 100% of baseball rules/ tactics are there (no pick-offs, double switch), but it has a great arcadey-simulation feel to it.         - Physics are solid        - Hitting is fun3) Look and feel        - Probably part of the game that is most charming.          - The characters and stadiums are fantastic.          - Ads are hilarious.  LOL Crab Pasta Bar ftw        - Made up players and teams.  Nice deviation from MLB as the players and teams are always relevant to the         environment.I would suggest to check it out if you like baseball "

												When i was a kid, i loved Baseball games.And today i found this game! SMB (not super mario :) extra innings!you start it up and it looks kinda childish, but it has so much to it!!!  you can chose default team or make your own without overwriting the default, which is totally awsome. The tutorial is great! and all the little things it has to offer!.first off, you might think, simple. WRONG! there are so many things, controlling every base runner where to run etc. really good pitcher fool system, pick a throw but change it after you throw it!Train your team in season mode, hire trainers, upgrade players, maybe even get power ups? and go for the win!batting controls are easy, simple with controller (i use xbox 360) many ways to hit the ball, normal swing, power up swing, tap swing. If you want to be really pro at this game, you need to learn all the deep controls which can be quite advanced and not easy to handle, but once mastered you will kick your friends♥♥♥♥♥ you can even play spiderman (Wall climbing to catch the ball)I really recommend this game if you are a baseball fan and like to watch awsome looking characters run wild, dont be fooled by the cartoonish graphic and that it might look sinple, ITS NOT.      *thumbs up!!!!*			"

												EDIT: Added a list of game mechanics I enjoy.Friendly visuals combined with its arcadey gameplay make this an extremely accessible baseball game on the PC!But don't let the skin of the ball fool you, this game has meat! There's much more depth here than you may expect. A ton of super-solid game mechanics with the right amount of control to satisfy those of us who want to jump in and play but also feel like we're mastering a game and crave the feeling of progression.Some of the solid game mechanics I enjoy:BATTING - has both tap button swing and power swing (hold the button to build up power and release at the right moment) all the while moving your mouse/controller to position the bat. Increasing the EGO (difficulty) will make positioning the bat more important!PITCHING - similar to batting, has a tap button pitch or power pitch by holding the button and aiming with the controller (or mouse).FIELDING - while simple, the options to jump, dive, and wall jump all exist. On higher EGO ratings, you will need to guide your fielders more towards the ball.BASE RUNNING - a nice feature here is you can tell all players to run at the same time OR you can control individual players (want 2nd base to run to third but 1st base to stay put? No problem).EGO (difficulty settings) - It has a difficulty system that allows you to fine tune the AI to provide you with the pefect non-frustrating balance of challenge (the values range from 0-99!), it's really quite incredible. This allows you to tweak the game's difficulty as you get better but keep it from being frustratingly difficult, unless you want it to be.To put it simply, Super Mega Baseball is brilliant and an absolute joy to play.My only con: multiplayer is local only.Super Mega Baseball came out of left field for me and seriously hits it out of the park!Highly recommended.Some gameplay footage:

												Although steep in price, I'm sure sports fans from all ages will enjoy this one. I got it on sale and do not regret my purchase one bit. Yes, it's Baseball (my least favorite sport) represented in the form of a cartoon but it's game play does not lack whatsoever. First off, the game is local co-op. I just wanted to make sure everyone knows this because this is an awesome thing on steam. Second, the game play is also varied in it's works. At first, all the batting styles and pitching styles may seem relatively the same. Upon reading the instructions (as I usually do after an hour into the game) you can definitely mix up your style in order to meet the demands of the play. The batter can swing using ""A"" in which is a straight through swing. ""B"" will let you bunt while holding ""X"" will let you decide how much power to put into your swing. Alternatively, using the right thumb stick will let you sort of have a say in where the ball goes. This selection also uses a power setting in which starts at 0 and goes all the way up to 99 then back to 0. Timing is important in the game and plays a role from batting to pitching. When pitching (playing solo), the player will have to line up his pitch into a small box that is displayed. The game is even nice enough to show you where the ball is planning to go. These arrows may point in a different direction depending on what type of pitch you choose. I believe there are 8 different pitches to choose from including fast balls and forkballs. Playing local co-op though, there are no boxes displayed as to where you should line your shot up. This doesn't take away from the game as you can still get some fancy throws off. Playing out field is relatively simple and you'll feel almost in complete control of your players. ""LB"" tells all players to run around the bases while ""RB"" tells everyone to run back to the previous. You can tell individual players to run to certain bases and even play some tricks running back and fourth. Pressing ""RB"" while playing outfield will make your player jump while pressing ""RT"" will make them dive. These are fantastic features but can sometimes be slightly misleading. Spacing sometimes plays an issue as I'm unsure whether to press one of those buttons or not in fear of completely missing the ball. You, as the player have to give some time to the actual players to pick up the ball. The ball is throwing accordingly to the button layout (Y - 2nd base, X - third base, A - home and B - 1st base) and holding down the throw button brings up a power meter of how hard to throw the ball. Releasing at the right time will give you desired power. The controls overall are pretty on point and you'll be blaming yourself more than it for mess-ups. Level of difficulty can be adjusted but be aware, anything over 20 is pretty tough (and 20 is medium)! The teams also have different characteristic settings as some are better at bat than pitching. All teams have ridiculously funny names.The graphics are very enjoyable and the character designs are fantastic. Everything seems like it was taking slightly over the top but it's absolutely suiting. I wish they would add maybe one or two more arenas to play in. The ones that are given are none the less pretty.The local co-op scheme is absolutely phenomenal and well organized. Don't know whose pitching? Don't know whose batting? Don't know whose playing outfield? Don't know whose controlling what? Take a quick glance before the pitch is thrown and you'll see which player is assigned which task. Sounds are funny as the umpire will have you laughing when he sends you off the field (YOOOOOUUUURRRR OUTTAAAHEEERREEE isn't the start of it...  a deep low voice will be saying some random stuff that you'll have to listen to carefully to make out what the guys yelling in a mumbling fashion). From the bat making contact with the ball to the throws themselves, everything seems on point.Overall, a really fun baseball game that closely mimics a real one. Don't let the cartoon graphics fool you, this game will challenge you. Just wish there was multiplayer.RATING : 7.9/10 Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B+ Overall  BScreenShots : What a home run looks like A display of the teams and their unique abilities  He should of dived Hey Arnold! is making his debut in base ball What a local co-op games looks like.

												Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings is just plain fun to play. If you're a fan of baseball and are frustrated with the lack of good sports titles on the PC, this game will help fill part of that void in your gaming life.While SMB:EI does have a local multiplayer and local co-op mode, it's worth noting that it DOES NOT INCLUDE AN ONLINE MULTIPLAYER MODE. I know this can be a deal-breaker for some and that's perfectly understandable. I would love to see online multiplayer in this game as well. However, I can honestly say I would still recommend this game to those of you who are being held back by the lack of online multiplayer. It's just that much fun to play! The lack of sports titles on the PC make SMB:EI a must-have for gamers who are eager to add a sports title to their gaming library.PROS Fast-paced gameplay Easy-to-learn game controls Fun graphics that are easy on the eyes Season Mode Player progression carries over from season to season Crowds are electric and enthusiastic Stadiums are very well done EGO system allows you to make the games as easy or as hard as you want It's a baseball game on the PC!CONS No online multiplayer mode Inability to save in the middle of a game "

												This game is great. I'd recommend it even to hardcore baseball fans. It's like how Mario Kart is to racing games. Lighthearted but can get very serious. (I won on a 2 out, 9th inning walk-off home run and it was intense! Ego set to 50)SMB is very easy once you get a hang of the controls but you can easily adjust the difficulty even during the season. You can hire coaches, gear dealers, and trainers to give your team a stat boost as you level up while playing season mode. It's a little confusing on how it works at first. There is no trading of players but you can customize each players look, name, and number if you wanted to attempt to make your favorite MLB team. The gameplay is quick. A 9 inning game usually takes me around 30 minutes.It has nice keyboard/mouse and controller support. No issues for me on Windows 10. I have not seen an option to unlock the framerate but it runs at an acceptable 60fps.			"

												Can't stop playing this! I'm not a hardcore baseball game player, though I've tried the MLB 2K series, and I found it and games like it to be way too realistic or simulation-like in the way they approach gameplay, and tend to have an overwhelming amount of modes and options that are just far too daunting for a casual player.Super Mega Baseball, though, is just the perfect blend for me of realistic baseball sim + jump-right-in-and-have-fun-immediately. It has only the essence of what's actually interesting and fun about baseball games, and removes or simplifies the parts that are tedious or overly specific. It's just batting/bunting, fielding, baserunning, and pitching, with some lightweight roster management.There are some definite shortcomings: for me, the most annoying one is the lack of a way to save progress of a game you're in the middle of. This is especially annoying when you're playing a season game that ""matters,"" because if the game crashes or if you have to turn the game off for any reason, that particular game gets recorded as a loss.But apart from a few small things, this is just a joy to play. A lot of people have dinged the art style for being too cartoonish, but I think it's fun and charming in a Mariokart kind of way. If you even remotely enjoy baseball, I think you'd love this game. A game controller is highly recommended, incidentally.			"

												This game is absolutely frickin' awesome.  The graphics are perfect for this kind of arcade-y game.  The controls are great and the difficulty system is unique and pretty solid.  The lack of MLB license couldn't be less relevant.  It is super fun and that's all you really need.  The price point is just right and I feel it is worth every penny.  I had some launch issues, but the devs were right on it with a new patch -  and this is a game that had console versions before PC.  That takes at least SOME dedication.  Comparatively, I actually like RBI Baseball '15 and the MLB players are nifty, but this is mostly because of my nostalgia for the NES/Super NES-gen games.  The glitches are somewhat ""ignorable"" in that game, however in this game, they are non-existent, at least thus far, which makes it even better.  I'm not going to tell you what to buy or how to spend your money, but this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Don't let the graphics or the nameless players scare you off, this is the best baseball game on steam. Has some silly cartoony quips, and the umpires voices are hilarious. You can change the names of players and looks, and augment their stats with various coaches with stat modifiers. Has exhibition or season mode, and keeps up with your player/team stats, as well as league leaders.  With (fairly) realistic physics, customizable difficulty (EGO system, 0-100 with 100 being most difficult),  customizeable players and a good selection of teams with strengths and weaknesses, this is really a fantastic game. 9/10			"

												At this juncture, of all junctures, I am just going to quote the Beast himself when it comes to this game: This game is straight up biblical. It's great. I would recommend it to all true Egorgians who are in need of biblicality in their lives on this planet full of social degen nerds.(Seriously, though, this is a great game that I can't heartily recommend enough to any baseball fans on Steam. Heck, even if you don't care much for baseball, try it out. There's just something endearing, addictively so, about this game to me. I think it's the old time feel, the idylllic interpretation of what's fondly called America's Pastime. Ever see the Hey Arnold episode when Arnold catches the last home run of Mickey Kaline? That's what playing this game feels like to me.The players might seem cartoony, but don't let that dissuade you from the game, as it's got quite a lot of depth to it. It's a solid baseball game, and within moments of booting it up, I was having a blast knocking 'em outta the park.The customization is a bit limited for my liking, but for what the game offers, it's still good - put your friends, family, whoever you want, really into the game and win the championship! No online multiplayer, so for those eager to slug it out with friends, you'll have to wait till the sequel. As well, can I just give a shoutout to the developers? A great bunch of people who are so welcoming and friendly to fans and newcomers alike. So sorely needed in an age where devs seem to want nothing more than to nickle and dime you at every opportunity, and without even the simple courtesy of civility about it too. So props to Metalhead - hopefully more devs will emulate them instead of resorting to childish nonsense like so many others on here).			"

												I like baseball games but I don't like overly complicated baseball games so I haven't bought a baseball game in years.  I've played the Xbox 360 trial of RBI baseball and thought it was terrible.After this came out on PS3 one of my friends snagged it and told me about it so I purchased it.  Don't let the cartoonish graphics fool you, this game is tons of fun.They did a great job on the physics and took care to make sure base runners were the correct speed compare to throws and whatnot so double plays are realstically difficult and you're not going to throw out a batter at first base from right field. The thing I like most about the game is the hitting.  If you play on the lower levels you can get away with just using a button to swing.  The harder you make the game the less help you get with batting.  The increments of how much you get help with this go from 0 to 99 and it's called ""Ego"".  This makes it very easy to fine tune exactly how difficult you want the game to be.  The Ego setting also controls how good your fielder's jump is on a ball and how much you have to control them before they get to the spot where the ball is.  It also changes the difficulty of locating your pitches.  In the PS3 version there was just an overall Ego meter.  In the Steam version they've changed it so you can either just change the overall ego or adjust specific Ego settings for Batting, Baserunning, Pitching and Fielding.  I haven't messed with the individual Ego settings as it hasn't been necessary for my enjoyment of the game.I have my Ego set at 50 and can still score between 5 - 10 runs a game just using the single controller button to hit.  I've tried the game on higher levels but haven't really attempted to go above 60.  Above that and it turns into the kinds of games I've avoided since then I'd have to move the cursor to get a bat on the ball and that's just not fun for me.Metalhead did a really good job on this port.  My system has an i7 3770 and an nVidia 670 graphics card with 2GB of RAM.  I have all the settings maxed out and the game stays smooth all the time.			"

												I have mixed emotions about this game. I will recommend it,because if you love baseball,its a great game.In itself it is an awesome baseball game. The physics off the bat and in the field of play are great. You can see the ball change directions on the lip of the grass or deflecting off the mound. The ball also plays very well off the fences. I do wish it was a little deeper. A 10 season Franchise mode with star points of course,more teams/divisions,aging players, pick offs,pitcher warm ups,deeper rosters,track errors, because they are a problem. I would also like to see it keep your W/L records for different egos, and be able to save multiple seasons.It could also use a stadium for each team(or at least for each team in a division) and the ability to pick your home stadium. I would be willing to pay for these additions. They would make a very good game better.It does have problems in my opinion....I start at a certain ego to start the season (65),every time I win I add 2 ego,and everytime I lose I subtract 2 ego. I hold steady from 67 to 73 ego. I have never won a game at 73. I believe the game has issues at higher egos. At 73 ego I can generally predict how a game is going to go. I will score a few runs(2-4) early. I will hold them for till 7th or later. Then the AI will start hitting the ball in nearly perfect areas on the infield, where you have to dive,but wont catch it and the throw will not be in time, or my team will commit 2 to 3 errors in the inning. I wont have an error all game till the late inning with a lead. If I'm losing, errors are not an issue.Player errors grossly outweigh the AI errors. Also there are issues with fielder control. I was trying to field a ball with a left fielder ,charging the ball and suddenly I switch to the SS. The ball drops in front of the LF and the tying run scored. This is because its perfectly placed between the LF,3B and SS, and I have learned it is usually better to use the OF.These issues are very frustrating. There is also times at high egos that if you throw a strike it gets hit hard. You can not throw a ball by the AI. This seems to be in big games vs. Division leader or a team ahead of you in the standings. Its generall early in the game...and doesnt last after a good lead.Why you ask do I still recommend this game? Because even with these issues...this is a great game. The physics ( which are a big thing for me in a baseball game) are excellent. Its fun and challenging. If you enjoy a good baseball game its right here. Play/load times are fast. It could be a little deeper ,but its a good game.Also I think the fooled/anticipated idea needs to go. Why would a guy anticipate a pitch out of the strike zone and swing at it. On the other hand a batter who is fooled will smack it to the fence.			"

												This game is incredibly fun and addictive. It's so fun to customize each player on the team from the ground up. The season mode adds to that customization, and let's you track stats for each player. There are a few things I'd like to see added like team customization (logo and name), online play, but most importantly... PLEASE ADD A REPLAY FEATURE! I've had so many amazing plays I want to watch again, save and share and there's no way to do it outside of recording your own gameplay. Other than those few minor details... Perfect baseball game.

												This is THE BEST baseball game I have played on PC, and possibly any console -- and I've been gaming since 1978!  It is an ""arcade"" type sports game, and not very strategy oriented (you can't shift fielders, for example).  The play is straightforward and physics-based.  It is also a ton of FUN!  The bobble-head characters are great to watch, even when you strike out.  There is a great attention to detail on this game, in a painstakingly cartoonish style.  The sense of humor and lightness continues right down to the stadium ads and billboards; I've fudged a few outfield plays laughing at them!  The very best feature is the EGO system -- it is a FULLY scalable difficulty system, like nothing I've ever seen before.  You can set an overall level -- incremented by 1s! -- and can ALSO scale individual systems (hitting, pitching, fielding...)  All in all, if you like baseball for the fun of playing and not the hair-tearing management parts, it's the perfect representation with everything great in our national patime!			"

												I typically don't play sports games, but for some reason I decided to try this one out.  Started playing today, thinking i'd do one game and ended up playing 10.  Nice leveling system, that allows you to hire better and better people to help modify and make your players stronger.  I'm doing a 48 game season (Longest), and it's fun.  Kind of wish there was some sort of trade and rookie type system to keep modifying your team, but this isn't the price of a AAA game, so understandable.Also has a ego rating difficulty system, which you can set between 1 and 99.  Right now I just left it at default of 15, most likely i'll start increasing difficulty...which from my understanding means the higher you go, the more you will have to control everything.  They higher difficulty you go the more stars you are awarded as well.Very nice game.			"

												Super fun!  Took the Beewolves through a full season on 20 ego - had a few up and down games including some awesome 9th inning comebacks and ended up going 14-2 for the season. Dominated the playoffs and ended up in the final game against the Herbisaurs with what became a homerun derby for the Beewolves and a final score of 30-1. It was a blast. Short version - it's an excellent baseball game - perhaps the most fun I've had in a sports game in a long time. Lots of depth and replayability with a stylistic charm of its own. Definitely worth the money.Couple of things I want in a future version - the ability to trade players (damn you, Billy Laboink!!), a better coach/gear system (the current one is ok, but confusing and limiting), better fielding controls, and non-local cooperative play.

												Is it perfect? No. Is it as good as The Show? No. Is it the best baseball game currently available on PC? Yes (unless you prefer the number-crunching spreadsheet greatness of Out of the Park). Yes, the game is designed to be played with an Xbox controller, and this is overwhelmingly obvious throughout and cannot be changed. Yes, there is no online multiplayer, local only, which may be a turnoff to some.  And, yes, the depth of season mode is limited; there is no trading players, no injuries, and a limited number of teams.But if you're willing to sacrifice depth for fun gameplay, then I'd say go for it. The art style is memorable, the characters standout (Hammer Longballo, you're my hero), and the lighthearted appearance does not detract from the fun of the actual 9 innings. If you have a PS3 or PS4, then you should obviously pick up The Show; it is undoubtedly the perfect baseball game. However, until we get anything remotely close to it on PC, this is your best bet. Long story short, pick this up before you even think of getting RBI, it is a much better game even without the MLB license.			"

												Super Mega Baseball is a fun little baseball game with a fair amount of depth. Though if I had to choose between this and MLB The Show (not even sure if they still make that) I would pick MLB The Show.The Pros:-Fun and simple to get a grasp of-The cartoon style is charming-It feels really satisfying to get hits/homeruns-Really cool difficulty management Cons:-while it is simple some of the simplicity can take away from the game-The cartoony style is charming, but it can feel kinda annoying after a while atleast to me-Pobabaly the biggest gripe i have with the game is the fielding its automatic for the most part other than choosing where to throw or diving. (Idk if this changes on higher ego level)-Lack of team creating which is odd considering this game seems perfect for that kind of thing.-The creators seemed to try and market this game to people who dont like or know how to play baseball which is extremely odd for a sports game. I mean one of the trailers explained all of baseball rules which is just weird to me. That might be why the game can feel overly simple. (This honestly isnt a big deal more of just an obvservation not really so much a Con)-Also no multiplayerTo sum up the game is charming and fun to play if you like baseball and have been waiting for a PC baseball game. 7.5/10			"

The graphics are cartoonie but great, and the gameplay is just plain fun.The only realy negative is that there is no online multiplayer. Hopefully they can add it in future installments.			"

												Such a fun game. Feels very reminiscent of Backyard Baseball, all wacky characters and designs. The hitting can get a little easy unless you have the difficulty up all the way up, same with pitching but it does get rough near the top difficulty. If you're a fan of baseball games and have played them I think you'll be good at the game and have a good time playing it. Would love an online vs feature sometime.			"

												★★★★★ If you enjoy baseball? I would certainly pick this one up. It is a great game. Smooth and fluid animation with the controls that match realistic gameplay. It does increase with difficulty as you progress which can be frustrating at times. Still really fun.			"

												Do you remember Baseball Stars on the NES? This isn't Baseball Stars, but that's the type of ""We don't have MLB licensing so we're going to replace realism with being really fun"" kind of game this is. The default controls are far easier than going outside and standing where 90 mph projectiles are hurled by your face. The game speed is set far better than real baseball games where spitting and butt scratches are eclipsed only by commercial breaks.This is baseball except it is better than baseball. Maybe that's why they added the super and mega to the title. This is an excellent game. I will probably sink more hours of my life into it than I should and in the end that is the point of all good video games.			"

												Love this game! Best baseball game on Steam. Not without its flaws tho. I rate it 3.5/5. Only real cons I have are there's no career mode, or online mode. Which isn't huge. But the fact that it's been 6 months without an update makes me think they COULD have done more and done better but refused too.			"

												Pros:  Perfect blend of fun freedom and unintimidating baseball.  Surprisingly deep player progression and specialization.  Keeps track of most relevant player stats.  Great difficulty system.Cons:  Some crashing issues that force you to forfeit.  Some very inconvenient player progression issues.I've put in a lot more time into this game than I thought I would, and its due to its consistent fun and high ceiling of player progression. Batters and pitchers have specific offensive and defensive stats that can be boosted through modifiers placed in skill slots. I've played through five medium-length seasons and still haven't unlocked all the skill slots for my players. You can play against your old teams by starting a new team in a new season and adding the old teams in, which is a very cool bonus. My game has occasionally crashed, which automatically hands you at 0-1 loss, which is frustrating. I've also experienced some inconsistencies with the available skill modifiers. For example, throughout my entire season with the Crocodons (a power pitching team), I had very very few useful pitching modifiers available to use. Other than these two issues, SMB is a huge blast that is definitely worth the price tag if you like baseball. Very much looking forward to SMB 2!			"

												I initially started writing a really long thorough review of the game and I realized I didn't have the patience for that so I'll just leave at this: I don't play sports games, save NHL 13 on Xbox360. This game is awesome. Sports and non-sports fans alike can find mass amount of replayable enjoyment. I love this game. If you ever played Backyard Baseball, you will be right at home.Another thing, I don't preorder games ever, but I am preordering SMB2 the moment it is available. Get it.EDIT: Most important note I'd like to make is that the developer is amazing. Very responsive to community and dedicated to the game 100% delivering the best content and gameplay. Play this and you will understand.			"

												I am new to baseball as of June this year, admittedly when there was nothing else on the sports channels at 1am in the UK. Man, am I delighted to have gained an interest in this awesome sport and also this awesome game.Now, I'm aware that this is my first baseball game and the benefit of that is that I have nothing to compare it to in terms of quality, playability etc. But I stress, I am a gamer since the Sega Master System days and my Steam profile is offline- so trust me when I say the 30+ hours I have ACTUALLY pumped into this game are filled with the utmost pleasure and joy.The physics and characters are great. There are excellent custom options, a unique perk system and unless you're getting slaughtered game-after-game, you can session game this over 2+ hours. It is simple to pick up but challenging to master. There's a very generous difficulty gradient and I feel this prolongs the life of the game. The only drawback (albeit minor) is there isn't enough variety in the stadiums and when you have more than one fielder chasing a ball, the auto selection overrides itself and both end up running away- which is costly to your innings.Small problems, I do stress. I am super excited for the second in the series coming soon. But I wholeheartedly recommend.			"

												Blowfish versus the Wild Pigs. Whoever wins this game is going to the playoffs. Bottom of the ninth, Wild Pigs are up by one, but you have men on first and second. Nirub Oowanga is up to bat. He's been swinging at wild pitches lately, so you pull him out and put in your super-sub, none other than Rod Forth. A pitch flies down the middle, one of Wes Yogurts trademark 98 MPH four-seam fastballs. Strike one, quickly followed by strike two. You charge up a mighty power swing in anticipation for Yogurt's strike three change-up. It comes right down the middle, you let go, a ninety-nine power slam goes into deep center and wins you the game.			"

												If you can get past the very cartoony art style there is a fantastic and affordable baseball game here. Possibly the best I've ever played. The pitching mechanics are incredibly satisfying. The developers really nailed the game feel on that front. The fielding has a bit to be desired (I believe you get a certain level of auto assist based on the difficulty level you're playing on) - errors can happen but for some reason aren't tracked. The hitting is OK for the most part. The trainer stat boosts are a unique and interesting mechanic that adds to the replay value. So fun stealing bases with a maxed out speed player			"

												This game plays on Windows 10. I couldn't find any reviews or information as to whether SMB would play on this latest OS from MS (although by the time I write this they will probably have come out with another wallet sucking venture). As a result I was reluctant to purchase this game. However, I decided at the price, what the heck... I would give it a try.What a beautiful game. So happy that it runs smoothly with Windows 10. Don't let the arcade style cartoonish baseball players fool you. It is still baseball and so much fun in its simplicity. The EGO system is a stroke of genius. There is still enough tweaking that can be done to keep it interesting. Re-naming player names to Actors names was a hoot. It is a wee bit confusing at first, but within a few hours and some experimenting you will get the hang of it. If you want to micro-manage every little aspect, then don't waste your time. BUT if you just want to have a bit of fun playing an excellent baseball game... it is well worth the $20.This game is visually stunning. The colours are vibrant and pop right out. The different ballparks are amazing. Please take note; the teams are not ""linked"" to any particular ballpark as there are more teams than ballparks. My understanding since joining the forum at www.supermegabaseball.com is that it takes time to create the ballparks and there will likely be more added in the future. The ones they have now are fantastic. The stands are full of cheering throngs of cartoon fans. The atmosphere is electric at times and you really get the feel of playing at a packed stadium. The cut scenes in between innings are outstanding. What a gem of a game. The streets outside the ballpark, full of traffic. Sparks flying off hydro poles. Subway cars, birds dive bombing the field, ferry boats... the detail put into this is absolutely amazing. I just cant say enough about the graphics. Outstanding!!!Since this is a console game ported over for computers it is a little tricky using a mouse and a keyboard. There is an option to re-map the interface controls to keys on your k/board, which I found useful. The fielding and throwing of the ball to different bases is very challenging. Using the mouse and finding the right ""sweet spot"" is difficult. Almost wants to make me go out and buy a controller, which this game supports. I would probably do just as bad though, since I have never owned a console platform and never used a game controller.The devs and programmers are very quick to address any problems you might run into. They quickly answer your question and let you know how to solve a problem if one should arise and if it can be fixed. At least they get back to you and you are not ignored. Bottom Line: Buy this game. It is well worth the money and I cant see it staying at this bargain price.			"

Slightly complicated to learn all the different control schemes due to all the well-represented game mechanics, but the ego difficulty setting helps ease you into the more fine-grained controls. Oddly, all pitchers have access to all pitches and base stealing is simplified, but otherwise this game has a surprisingly true-to-life and fun baseball simulation under the hood.			"

												Well, after my first game (a loss), I have to recommend this game. I've been playing baseball games since the days of Bases Loaded (NES), Hardball (Commodore) and some of the newer titles like MVP and The Show. It's definitely a blast to play and I'm only 40 minutes in or so. It's easy to grasp for someone new to the sport as the in-game tutorial messages are clear and concise.  The artstyle fits in nicely including the audio. I love how the umpire calls balls and strikes, and of course putting some wood onto the ball. CRACK! My first game went into extra innings after I brought in my closer and I gave up a jack in the bottom of the 5th (played a short game to get my feet wet) leading 4-3. I lost 5-4 due to an outfield error in the 7th.  I played well after giving up 3 in the first. Solid baseball game even if it doesn't take itself seriously like some AAA ball games do but still delivers some good ol' fashion baseball. Batter up!Do check it out, you won't be disappointed but do your due dilligence in case you are looking for something specific.EDIT: Started a short season. The game actually has some nice stat tracking, too. If you're into that.			"

												Excellent mechanics in this game, including pitching, fielding, batting, and running. I love the pitching, but still really bad at batting. I won't get too deep into the great things about the game since it's already been covered by many others. The game is true to baseball mechanics and that makes me so glad that they don't have MLB licence so they could simply focus on the mechanics, and what a superb job they've done.Another thing is that Metalhead Software responds to their customers in a timely fashion. I think these guys really care. Thanks.What I wish the game had:Personally I'd like to be able to swing at any pitch even if the indicator doesn't turn red and even if I miss by a mile, as I just feel restricted, but I'm sure there's a reason for it; I just don't know it.As others have pointed out, it would be nice for an update to this game or included in SMB 2 (if any), that the seasons continue on to be recorded (but not a big deal) and each team had their own stadium (big deal).The crowd should mostly root for the home team and boo or be quiet for the visiting team. For the most part, they cheer indiscriminately, and that makes it feel less like a real baseball game.I'd like to be able to skip the home run sequences.Practice features such as hitting and base running would be very helpful.This game is very fun and very replayable. The models are really basic, but it more than makes up for it everywhere else, especially gameplay and controls, and that's much much more important than the models. I score this game a 9/10.			"

												If you are bored of the games currently in your Steam library and are looking for something new, this is the game you need to buy! Affordable, addictive game-play, easy to learn but hard to master, unique integration of ""ego"" as the game's difficulty setting,... this game checks all the points that a gamer should want out of a game.It also has excellent graphics, funny player / team names, team customization, friend leader-boards...  a polished game that can only get better with future updates and added features. It has a small but active steam community so visit the steam forums and add friends to your leader-board and get tips on how to improve. Would be nice if it had online multi-player (currently has local multi-player) and MLB licensed teams, but I imagine this is the next logical step for this game. Regardless, if / when online multi-player or MLB licensed teams come to this game, the current version should be an ""insta-buy"".Super Mega Baseball hits the nostalgia spot too! If you remember having hours of fun playing baseball games for NES and SNES (Baseball, Base Wars, Tecmo Baseball, Ken Griffey Jr) then you need to buy this game now! If you never played a baseball game before but enjoy the sport, buy this game cause it will keep you coming back for more!It's the type of game where I come home after work and look forward to having some free time just so that I can play. So stop reading other reviews and buy this game now! You will get your moneys worth for sure. GG (Great game)			"

												All the best aspects of classic baseball games on early consoles. Keyboard + mouse controls were weird, but it is very playable with a 360 controller. With a controller I had no issues with players doing anything other than what I wanted them to do. The animations are fun and there is little downtime between pitches and innings.No online multiplayer hurts. Season mode is simplistic, this isn't The Show and if you come in with that level of expectation you will be disapointed. Overall an enjoyable budget baseball game.			"

												Baseball is one of my favourite sports; correction, holding the top up there with racing that I love. Yet, I could not find any baseball games, which would provide the gameplay satisfaction I experience when I play the sport out in the field with my mates. I've tried out most baseball titles I could get my hands on, such as Out of the Park, Hardball, RBI, MLB, MVP, High Heat etc etcAs such, I was reluctant getting Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings but based on feedback I decided to do so. And it didn't disappoint. Despite it's cartoony demeanour, it is fun to play. SMB has customisation of players & teams through a team editor, a good tutorial, adjustable difficulty levels, exhibition and season modes, with local co-op (handicapped). well most of everything that one would expect from a decent baseball game.On the other hand, it doesn't come with real rosters (huge effort changing every player manually) or leagues (blame MLB licensee Sony?), which is acceptable for an arcade style casual session. In addition, it has no online or any type of multiplayer modes (besides local coop), which could have been the stepping stone to make SMB a great game.Despite its few short-comings, Super Mage Baseball: Extra Innings is a good game to enjoy, in short bursts, baseball fan or not.

												This game is fun to play. After all the 'Sim' games I've played over the years, what a relief to just play and have fun. I'm not worried about injuries, the draft, warming up the bullpen, resting starters... I just play. The physics seem realist enough, I love the collision detection, having a ball hammer off the foul pole is awesome. Watching it bounce around after a HR is oddly satisfying. The depth is there with player perks you earn as you level up. My only real gripe is I wish the leveling up process held my hand a little bit in the beginning... knowing how to upgrade my players wasn't quite obvious in the beginning. I sort of found out by accident how to fill in all the coaching slots for my players. The perks you get to give your players really adds incentive to boosting your ego in order to level faster. Bottom line, lots of fun, worth getting.			"

												If I could complain about one thing where this game is concerned, it's this. When you're in the outfield, you have to move your mouse the direction of the base you want to throw too before throwing, otherwise it defaults to first base. I'd much rather see the base selection controlled via wasd. That aside though, it's a decent game. It's simple enough for casual gamers, but can be cranked up to be more challenging for hardcore players if desired. If you're a baseball fan, you'll like it. Me, I like it more then most baseball games, mind you I haven't really gotten into any since the days of Baseball Simulator 2000 and Ken Griffey Jr Baseball.			"

												One of the greatest arcade baseball games I've played. It's like Backyard Baseball but much more difficult and in depth, and it has a ton of replayability due to its varying skill levels and high skill ceiling in general. One downside is there's no online multiplayer, though the devs have said they want to make it but are limited due to their small team. If you're looking for realism, probably not your game but generally its a fantastic game.			"

												Best Baseball game ever! This game presents the mechanics,strategies, details, stats, and game play experience of Real Baseball, but in a graphic style that is cartoonish in the best ways - big heads, huge jaws, overdone gestures, great fan animations - and fast, deep, and fun to play. Almost all aspects of the game are presented here in delightfully entertaining details, from a pitcher throwing so hard, he closes his eyes on release, to a glove-pump before throwing the batter out at first.You have two modes, exhibition and season, each customizable; there are three season lengths, a dozen teams to choose from, and a fully remappable selection of detailed controls; yet, you can play the entire game with just the mouse.The gameplay is smooth, the animations are believable and reflect excellent baseball motions and actions. The pitches are easily selected either with middle mouse button or from a clickable grid, or keyboard. Batting is as simple as a click at the precise moment, or take a chance on a power swing, which has a limited-time hold-down effect to improve power, but you better make good contact!You have a full pitching rotation. You have a bench of subs, and every player is rated in two positions.Once you select your team, you can customize them in incredible detail, change the uniforms, but the most impressive addition is the staff; you can hire coaches, trainers, gear-suppliers, etc. Each one has multiple factors to consider, each is different, and all add skills to specific players, up to three per staff member. It will make all the difference in a penant run - you must use the staff to your best advantage.Personally I made a bad choice when I installed, adjusting the base-selection sensitivity (set too low) and I couldn't throw properly from the field; even with this handicap, by batting the way real teams do - forcing the pitcher to throw strikes, going to the full count, etc., and by pitching with both variety of type and position, I was able to win championships. Then, thanks to the great tech support, a correction to my settings brought the full game back into my reach, and allowed me to increase a fully adjustable difficulty level (change it at any time) of my own liking. Double plays, triple plays, throwing out steals, leaping catches, and diving saves are all part of a fantastic in-game experience.Hands down, the BEST SPORTS GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.    THIS IS A MUST-HAVE!Addendum:This game is really much, much deeper than a simple arcade sports game; I missed that aspect the first times around. The STAFF function turns this game into a deep, strategic, and flexible baseball management experience. Without going into details, there's a lot of fun to had and results to be enjoyed from carefully and lovingly assigning the right staff to the right players, and the displays make it easy. When you have great players sitting on the bench, and you start rotating and developing your players, it is more fun than ever. Finally, you can modify default teams into more interesting and different looking and differently named teams that you have personalized; then setting up a season, you can toggle on the newly modified team in place of its default. Very cool.This game continues to impress!			"

												Listen..this game is unreasonably addicting.The only things that need adding are custom colors for teams and a mpre franchise esque approach to the seasons.. as in lettin one carry over to the next .. and trades would be great . I love how its an arcade/sim deal and hope the develp[ers take it further.. the mechanics are simple but deep  the tension that builds feels genuine and part of the flow of thegame.The difficulty is extremely malleable, allowing for you to get your newb on till you get the swing of things or just jump in with the ego on 100 if you think you are hank aaron reincarnated. Maybe more stadiums will be added via updates or dlc but that was also a thing that could use some beefing up.. but this is the best baseball game ive played since super bases loaded waay back on the snes..Graphics are A1 even on low settings, Music was nothing special ..but you can silence that.. lol Also , more character models should be introduced via update just to add variety..if the dev team stays constantly fresh with this one itll be on the top list for a while because everything it does right it does perfectly..and it does alotta things right. #classic			"

												I was looking at this for a few months before I decided to buy. Two big hurdles were lack of multiplay and triple screen support. I've read multiplay is coming (the sooner the better) and the 3 screen deal I would have to see for myself, so I took a chance. The aspect ratio is messed up when using 3 screens (windowed or full) but it works fine if the user does single screen windowed (1920x1080 for me) and I can live with that, for now. The game itself is a lot of fun (and I'm not real hot on BB) and easy to learn and I can use the mouse and KB on PC with no problems, I can also configure the KB the way I like and that's a big plus.Bottom line is it's actually a lot of fun and it shows my friends (that have the game) and my own stats/points so we can (sorta) compete, until multiplay is in and we can play online together. It's worth getting IMO.			"

												It's a fun game with a lot of merits, but some flaws really annoyed me to the point of asking a refund:- Every pitcher has the same repertoire (EVERY PITCHER can throw a screwball! There's no sinker or knuckleball, though).- No way to control lead off for baserunners- No way to pick off baserunners (but there is base stealing)- No multi-season modeThese issues alone lost me. The lack of advanced stats, even though I'm a stats nut, doesn't bother me because in non-simulation baseball games (that being everything but OotPB) the stats are never consistent for the player-controled team (the characters will end up reflecting the player's skills and struggles, and I don't think there is any way to avoid it without removing the fun of the game). Too bad I haven't a Playstation for The Show and don't plan to buy one until more games are released (and hopefuly its price drops), so I really wanted to like this game. I really hope the developers make a follow-up game that solves the issues I pointed, because, otherwise, the mechanics are really fine-tuned.			"

												When I play sports game I don't want reality.  I want it to be mechanically sound and super entertaining.  In terms of playing a baseball game, then I must compare it to 2020 super baseball.  Which I must say SMB does live up to the greats. The game mechanics are fun to play, sometimes challenging.  My ego is still a bit low, because I'm always a bit slow to take bases with more than one runner.  I play with the remote, I find it nice.  In conclusion, its a great game and GO MOONSTARS!!!!!!!

												This is a really fun baseball game, something that the PC has been sorely lacking. Don't let the cartoony characters throw you off. There is a lot of depth and challenge here. I especially appreciate that the difficulty sliders, or ""ego"" settings, can be varied in four categories; batting, pitching, fielding, and baserunning.I've always enjoyed the batting and pitching part of PC baseball, and less so the fielding, so I let the AI handle more fielding than the others.Hitting has a very solid feel to it. When you jack one out of the park, you really do feel a sense of getting all of it. Solid base hits and extra base hits feel equally rewarding.The ""mojo"" facor and emotional reactions are a brilliant touch. Watching the pitcher and batter literally sweat it out in a duel at the plate in late innings in a close game really brings the game alive. There also seems to be a very nice balance in letting the AI batters swing at pitches off the plate rather than having a perfect eye like so many other baseball games have had. Even the umpires seem to have some leeway in their strike zone.Congrats to the developers. They were also very responsive to an issue I had posted in the dicussions page, which did indeed turn out to be a problem with my controller.			"

												Crank the ego up to 90+ and it will really test your patience, great to have a game that can actually still do that.For instance: Top of the 9th with 2 outs, I am the home team up 1-0. Batter hits a ground ball to short and the short stop boots it, next batter pulls a fastball that was low and out of the strikezone that hits off the top of the wall for a 2 run homerun. My three batters in the bottom of the 9th fly out to the warning track. As crazy as that sounds its a blast to play. I just got it last week and have put a decent amount of hours into it, I dont see that slowing down any time soon either. Great arcade style fun to play. Also, this game does support 3440x1440 resolution which is a huge plus for me.			"

												The game is fairly fun, despite a cumbersome trainer/skills systems. The biggest problem is that it crashes a lot, which is fine, but if you're in season mode you instantly lose the game and potential player stats. This makes season mode pointless. Of a 32 game season, I lost 4-5 regular seasons games due to crashes and 1 playoff game, in addition to my player stats being randomized for those games. Most games that crash due to their own poor programming let you start over at some earlier point, but this game just chalks up a loss for you and moves on to the next game. The fun of watching season stats progress goes out the window and the game goes on the shelf.			"

It is genuinely one of the most dissapointing titles I have played in a long while. It looks like a beautifully crafted game, and I'm sure the developers have put their hearts and soul into this, but the lack of a proper tutorial, as well as a poor feedback loop on when actions should be performed just left me frustrated and confused.Technically Super Mega Baseball runs very well on a modest machine, and the art style is charming, however I didn't find Super Mega Baseball 'fun' and that's all I wanted from this title, a little fun.

												I am not one for Bashing games. I'm really not, I will give any game a Chance pretty much and have a long history of Gaming and Developing.Then why was this game the first Game on Steam I have requested a refund for?Quite frankly its the lack of scope.There are two modes in the Game.Exhibition and Season. There is no practice mode to speak of - instead the Game forces you to learn through a trial by fire. Innovative? Sure, legit replacement of a Practice mode where one could practice pitching balls, batting and so forth? No.Season mode is literally an extended version of Exhibition - this mode could have easily been fleshed out (and I speak of this from a Programmer perspective) to be a Career mode with RPG Elements seeing as there is a half attempt to do that very thing by including Coaches to train up your team.Coaches that apparently work for free and Players that just show up to play for the hell of it.That is it.That is what you are paying for - Two Game modes. No Tournament play, No in-house Leagues to speak of, no Multiplayer 4 way split screem where you could control a player each as they each take their turn on the plate and then maintain control of them whilst they are on the bases to REALLY bring that team play co op element out. Nothing.I am more frustrated at the limited scope this game has. I have left it on my wishlist despite refunding it and will keep an eye on its development. It has potential but if like me you are used to sinking time into a Game and actually have friends who come round to play (as I do as well as play with my Girlfriend) this is just too lacking in gameplay variety to be worthwhile at the price it is.Cartoon Graphics which dont capitalise on the medium by including any wacky modes and yet doesn't take itself seriously enough to include staples that make games like these a long term steam purchase. By sitting on the fence between these two ballparks this Game is unimpressive.Also I WILL echo what others have said in other comments - to launch this on Steam and not include a multiplayer section despite having Leaderboard highscores feels like a Rush job to me. Including such a Feature and/or online monthly leagues would make this game top ranked in no time especially given how you can customise players - Id happily pay for DLC to customise them further.If you are looking for a Casual no depth Baseball game to spend a few sessions a week on, sure, pick it up.I won't be until the Developer actually gives this game the potential it deserves.

												As a baseball fan, it's games like this that just make me absolutely furious. Not just about the quality of baseball games these days, but about the monopoly Sony continues to have over the MLB liscense. This is why for the last many years we have had poor quality games like this, RBI Baseball, and many others. If you havent been playing baseball games for a long time, you might have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'll try to elaborate. In the early to mid 2000's there were quite a few good choices to pick from when it came to baseball games. The 2k games,  The MVP Baseball series, and the MLB series were in their infant stages. Shortly after the 2005 season, the story goes that EA wanted the exclusive rights to produce Football games, more or less giving Madden the supreme domination over football games on the market. So in exchange for their monopoly over the NFL, they would stop making liscensed MLB games. They made a few NCAA Baseball games which were alright but stopped after 2007. By this time, the 2k baseball games and MLB The Show games were competing for first place in the market. This was alright for a while, the 2k games were available to all platforms while the MLB The Show games were only available on Playstation systems. Both games had their own unique flair and continued to innovate pretty regularly year by year. After a while though, the 2k games started to take a back seat to the more popular MLB The Show series and by 2013, they stopped making baseball games due to low sales. So you might see the problem here. The only competitor left was the MLB The Show series. This series is exclusive to Playstation systems, meaning anyone who didnt own a Playstation was excluded from being able to play any baseball games since 2013. Even worse, the MLB The Show games haven't been innovating in a long time. It's currently 2016 and since I happen to own a PS4, I've bought MLB The Show 2014, 15, and 16, and besides the obvious roster updates, there is hardly any innovation. This means that Sony has a monopoly over Baseball games that quite honestly havent made any decent improvements for years, leaving everyone else to either take it or leave it. This is pretty lame to the community of people who grew up playing baseball games, and want for some competition to spice up the market. Competition produces better quality games with more innovation. Hell I'd love to see a baseball game with a career mode with as much effort as the NBA 2k games! Sadly we get crap like Super Mega Baseball. A ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious baseball game with lousy gameplay, a terrible art style, where you play as a team of down syndrome patients who've escaped from their homes and formed a baseball league with the most stupid names possible for teams.

												Don't be fooled. It isn't really much of the pick-up-and-play, retro style fun game of baseball that it seems at first sight. The clunky controls, lack of options and modes and ridiculous, cringe looking characters don't help either. There's only two modes and that's it, barebones at best, the options are lackluster and the controls are bizarre for a game that's clearly not a sim. At first, by judging from the screens and videos one would think it's game akin to Midway's MLB Slugfest, basically the baseball version of NFL Blitz, but not even close, the game is just not fun to play, it's a borefest, not a slugfest.And the art style is terrible to begin with, the players have the charm of a sickened, damaged Mii character, one striken with a terrible condition like craniodiaphyseal dysplasia and achondroplasia. I thought I could get past it via customization options like I was led to believe in some in some reviews but it's not the case, you're stuck with this ghastly, Spore/NMS-like, procedurally generated looking creatures with big butts. If that's your fetish, if that gives you a hard-on, then look no further.If you want an awesome, old-school, plain fun baseball game with simply controls and that you can instantly get into, go pick up Baseball Stars 2 now!

												J'aime le baseball, autant commencer par là.Le système d'I.A est particulièrement bien fait et permet de régler la difficulté au poil de nouille pour qu'elle soit a votre niveau, pour être sûr de toujours avoir un adversaire à votre mesure.Cela dit, deux points qui m'ont fait regretter mon achat: - il n'y a pas grand chose: juste des matchs simples et des saisons (+/- longues, c'est customisable). Pour moi, il manque des modes de jeux (multi, carrière, my player, que sais-je..)- les contrôles sont compliqués et auraient surement pu être simplifié ou tout du moins être mieux expliqué. là, en l'état on nous balance 5.000 infos en 30 minutes, j'en ai oublié la moitié, du coup je ne sais pas contrôler correctement mes joueurs.BRef, bon ""petit jeu"", mais même en promo a 13 €, c'est un peu beaucoup cher pour ce qu'il y a dedans.

												I occasionally like baseball as a sport (I don't follow MLB or anything) so i'm not a supers fan at all, but i like the idea of the baseball game in which you have to time your batting and pitching and run around the bases, maybe upgrade your team and what not. I played in solo mode (not even sure if there is multiplayer) so i'll base my review on that. The mechanics of the game are not that bad for a baseball game, in essence, it is what you would expect, you need to time and select a good strategy for pitching and batting and you have a few options for stealing bases etc. But overall, this was fun for 1/2 a game for me, the AI is not challenging so its sort of a walk in the park for 35 minutes watching cut scenes and being bored. At the end of the game I thought at least i would spend some time upgrading and whatever and maybe it would get more interesting with time but the upgrading options are so light that they could just be non existent. I tried a few games like that but it was just unbeareable as a ""career"" mode game. Sorry Devs, nice effort, we don't see many of these in the market. But it needed something else.			"

												My first, ever review on steam.It is, without doubt, a travesty that I must give this game a thumbs down.This is a well-crafted, hybrid of on-field entertainment and franchise management.I absolutely loved this game.  Until, that is, I had to spend a half-hour of real life fixing a pizza and feeding my pets.  When I got back to my computer, the game had minimized.No problem, I thought...no problem until I waited for ten minutes for the video to re-establish itself, which it never did.No problem, I thought...no problem until I closed the application, only to re-launch and discover that I had lost to the Overdogs 1-0.Two games away from an undefeated, short season, permanantly tarnished...in a baseball game that promises to bring in new fans to the game as well as captivate seasoned fans like myself.A permanent, black stain on my account, due to game minimization/crashing is unacceptable.  Not in a single player game, anyway.  To have to restart/replay a game is not just accepted, but anticipated for situations like this.  To have a permanent loss on one's record, is absurd.0/10			"

												If you're looking for a game that is an accurate recreation of the actual game of baseball, this is not for you. Awful AI, wonky, cartoonish mechanics, and bugs galore. It would be a good cell phone game to kill time, but as a stand-alone PC game, it needs a lot of work.			"

												When it works, it can be fun. But about 4/5 times I start the game, it doesn't recognize my X360 controller plugged into my PC. I have to exit and restart several times in a row usually to be able to play. A lot of the time, after 4 straigh restarts of the game, I get fed up with it and don't even want to play it anymore.Hopefully the rest of you aren't experiencing this, but it is annoying enough for me to not recommend this game.

												Ok, so I had to take a breath and rewrite this review. I hate this game, so, so very much. The controls, especially for batting but even more so for fielding are just unintunitive. There are much, much better control schemes out there on $0.99 mobile baseball games. What makes things worse is there is no play-through tutorial to help you learn how they expect you to play, only a set of vauge unhelpful directions that don't explain anything and certainly do not show how to perfrom the actions. Maybe, just maybe that could be forgiven, since there seems to be a decent game hiding there somewhere (and all the positive reviews can't be that wrong) but with no way to just sit there and practice batting until I learn the controls except to play the game it gets frustrating and annoying fast. And there is no way to change the control setup on a controller, and moving the right stick and hitting a button on the same said on the controller is too complicate dto be fun. I bought this game because my dad's a big baseball fan and we used to enjoy playing the 90's era games where we passed the gameboy back and forth and I was hoping thsi was something we could play together locally. I'm willing to be proven wrong, though so if the developers read this review - please, please fix this game.			"

												After playing 2 exhibition games, this is a great sports game and a great spin on the sport of baseball. It seems like a game that would be easy to pick up but hard to master. Its got a Dugout Heroes feel to it but with a pitching and hitting component to it that I feel makes the game much more unpredictable and has more of a learning curve than Dugout Heroes. This is a good thing. It makes the game have a reason to learn to dial in and master your pitches instead of most other games that let you lace one down the middle pitch after pitch. Im looking forward to playing co-op with this one with friends and drink some Pabst.			"

												This game is a treat to play as it allows the player enough depth and challenge without abandoning the fun principle, which in unfortunately overlooked in many current games.   This fun factor is best supported by its solid  and mostly intuitive control mechanics and vibrant atmosphere.  This is the first baseball game that didnt compel me to go out and buy a brand new baseball bat and break it over my knee because the mechanics and flow of the game were so infuriating. The cons for some (which in my opinion are strengths as it contributes to its charm) are no mlb licencing (which is fine because I dont want to pay for that) and limmited teams and field choice (again acceptable as sometimes less is more as I find i spend more time looking at the options rather than playing).  As many pointed out, the running system is a little unintuitive.Bottom line: a fun engaging wieldly game that doesnt take it self too seriously but offers the player enough depth to play a casual arcade slugfest and/or manage, customize and play a team throughout a season.  Very pleased with this game!   "

												I really like this game. I was looking for a baseball game I can play season mode and I get this and more. I enjoy playing season modes in baseball not only to see if I can make it to the play offs and win but to see stats stack up during the season. How will each player has done for me through it all. This game not only gives me that but as you play consecutive seasons your over all stats are added together. I am right now in the middle of my second season in this game and I can see how many home runs I have hit, how many times I have struck out, how many pitches I have thrown how many double and triple plays I have made and on and on. I love this!The difficulty setting is something I have not seen. I am use to difficulty settings of something along the lines of ""Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard""  In this game your  difficulty is based on your EGO number. The higher the number the more difficult the game will become. It offers a grander scale to work with based on your desire so it is actually easier to find a good difficulty level for you than any other baseball game. (That I have played that is). Which brings me to my next thought, I was hesitant on buying this game, because I usually find in baseball games that you can create a team and just power slug fest your way through, having scores of 40-0 lol Its fun sure for awhile but then there is no difficulty and becomes boring after awhile. WIth the difficulty system you can avoid this problem. I have 2 things that I do not like about this game. The season is really short even on the longest length. 48 games. I can over look that though, it is just sad though. The biggest issue I found in this game, and it may just be me, but the controls on the keyboard. Have mercy I had such a hard time trying to adjust and use it that I finally got a game controller LOL. I recommend this game w/ controller!			"

												Seems arcadish at first glance based on how zany it is however this game has all of the proper elements in place for a fun baseball game. Rotating starting pitchers and upgrading coaches are a few of the additional elements to career mode in which you play the season. It has the standard gameplay elements of baseball games, batting you aim a cursor and try to properly time the swing. For pitching you try to hit your mark to pitch accurately and with velocity. Attributes are very basic and easy to understand. Velocity/Junk for pitchers, speed/hit/power for batters and fielding for playing the field. The game indeed has physics so there aren't any nasty surprises when you don't connect well on a swing. You can also alter any player's appearance and name which can give them additional character. Definitely a recommended game for anyone looking for a simple, fun baseball game.			"

No franchise mode, but if you are looking  for a franchise mode you also probably want more control during play. This game is not about that anfd you should look elsewhere.

												While I usually prefer simulation baseball games (like Out of the Park Baseball and MLB: The Show), I still had a lot of fun playing Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings. The game is very simple to learn and play and perfect for younger players. Even though the game doesn't have an MLB license, it managed to turn that negative into a positive with the impressive amount of diversity in their players. Players of both genders and all ethnicities, ages, and body types are included. I wish the game had a few more features (online multiplayer, the ability to trade, etc.) but it is still the best (non-simulation) baseball game available on Steam.Note: I received a free review copy of the game but received no other compensation for this review.

												The arcade playstyle, graphics, and gameplay in this game are beyond fun. The enjoyment I've taken from playing SMB reluctantly pushes me towards the ""thumbs up,"" but this game is not without issues.Cons--First and foremost: CRASHES. I took my beloved Moonstars on a long, 9-inning season. We dominated, it wasn't always easy but we got it done. Here's the deal: if the game crashes (which it does, most often RIGHT WHEN YOU WIN A ♥♥♥♥ING GAME) you take a loss. That's right, 11 innings of intense ball, we walked it off with a damn homer in the  bottom of the 12th and the game crashed. I reloaded, we had ""Lost 0 - 1"" against our division rival. I almost broke my keyboard.-Limited customization on a team level. In creating a new team, you're really cloning one of the twelve pre-existing ones with the option of customizing the characters themselves, but only by appearence. Hopefully someday we'll see the ability to create new teams and edit their icons, colors, player stats, etc.-Two game modes: Exhibition and Season. No batting, pitching or fielding practice.-ALL THE CONTROL MAPS ARE IN XBOX CONTROLLER TERMS. You will occasionally and minorly be indicated as to what keyboard/mouse controls to use but by in large, if you aren't playing with an xbox controller you'll have some learning to do. This makes fielding extremely difficult.Pros--You're wondering after all of that why I reccomend this game. In truth- it's just incredibly fun. As a die-hard baseball fan, I love every minute that this game is functioning well. It has a long way to go (more parks, teams, options, fixes, etc.) but the ceiling is VERY high.-Stats. They aren't overly advanced (no WAR, RC, WHIP, etc.) but you do get to build your players batting average, era, etc.over a season and that's cool-visuals are great, the crowd dynamic is awesome (though the devs should know most parks don't blow fireworks when the away team HRs...)-Season options are great-""Ego"" difficulty setting is awesome. You can customize the difficult of most aspects of the game to suit your playstyle.			"

PresentationWe’ve all heard the cliché, “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” Well don’t judge a game only on its graphics. This game might have some PS2 level graphics, but at least it means basically any computer made past 2004 will be able to run it. The stadiums and environments are pretty cool. They’re nothing too spectacular, but at least there are some interesting things to look at in the background along with the crowd. Speaking of the crowds, visually they are very impressive. They all look like individuals and all have animations that go at different times, not just flat picture in the stands that bobs up and down. Unfortunately, the sound is off. They cheer just as loudly for both teams, and they usually end up rooting for the away team which doesn’t make sense. Also, the sound design in general is just okay. Most of it is pretty decent, but some of it is just really annoying. (Que the Ump). Overall, presentation leaves a lot to be desired, but that’s not the main draw to this game anyway.  ContentSuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings does have a lot to offer in the content category. There are a good amount of teams to choose from to start your season. I love the fact that you can change every single one of your players from their physical characteristics to their name. You can hire and fire staff to help level up you players as well. The further you progress the better staff you are able to hire. I also like that you have a full stable of pitchers including multiple starting and relief pitchers, as well as a closer. You also have to manage their stamina so you can’t start the same pitcher multiple games in a row. It’s a really nice feature, one I wouldn’t assume a game like this would have, but it only adds to the simulation of the game. I wish there was some way to trade players. That is not too much of a big deal, but it would add to the simulation even more. There is also local CO-OP play, which is a must for me for any good sports game. Unfortunately, there is no online play for exhibitions or for season mode. I certainly wish there was as it would help with the replayabilty a lot. GameplaySuper Mega Baseball: Extra Innings really hit gameplay out of the park. The pitching is incredibly satisfying. Hitting can be pretty hit or miss. Sometimes it’s really easy and you hit 5 home runs in a row, sometimes you pop every one up. It’s still a really nice feeling system that I enjoy using. Fielding is okay, I don’t like that you can’t catch the ball on your own, the AI does it for you and diving could use a little work, but making nice diving catches and incredible throws feels really nice. I really like the scalable difficulty, the ego slider allows for basically 100 different difficulties as well as fine tuning the CPU’s stats with the Ego Mode button. This makes it a really easy game to get in to, as well as a pretty difficult game to master. My biggest complaint about the gameplay isn’t about gameplay at all. It’s actually the distinct lack of gameplay. When you are simulating until you play your next game, you have to watch each game. They usually take about 8 or so seconds to simulate, but when you have 15 games  to simulate, you spend a lot of time just staring at the screen doing nothing. Overall I love the gameplay.			"

												Fun and addictive, even if you, like me, don't have a clue about baseball. The controls are excellent, not arcadey at all and the difficulty system keeps it challenging. It's one of the best learning curves I've seen in a sports game. Personally I could have done with more teams, but that's about it on the negative side. Also it's good value for money			"

												Absolutely love this game. Easily the best baseball sim on PC and tons of fun! A must buy if you're looking for a fun baseball experience on PC.Pros-Suprisingly deep simulation. Physics are great-Fun, light cartoon style (Check out the signs all over the stadiums. They are hilarious!)-Customization of players (aesthics)-Tight batting and pitching mechanics-Fast paced games. No wasted time, all baseball!-""Ego"" difficulty system lets you customize the game to your level. You can set it so that every game you play is competitive and exciting-Stat tracking-Local multiplayer-Works great with mouse+keyboard or a gamepad-Great looking stadiums at a variety of settings-Tons of fun!Cons-No online multiplayer-Lack of depth in season mode (No trades or management, clunky player progression)-Only 12 teams in two divisionsOverall a fantastic, light baseball game with suprisingly deep physics and tight mechanics.

												I'm a sucker for arcadey-baseball games. Was a huge fan of the old Slugfest games and Mario Baseball on Gamecube. This game fits right in. You can expect a lot of offense, but the pitching mechanics also are quite fun and old-school.  If you hit your locations and put together decent pitch sequences, you can really shut down the opposing team's offense. The game employs a difficulty modifier called ""Ego"" that allows you to tweak the difficulty as you get better and better, which is a nice touch that seems to work well at keeping the CPU competitive.  I've never been a huge fan of the MLB The Show franchise, it's just too serious for my taste. Super Mega Baseball provides a nice casual baseball experience on the PC, which has been needed for some time.Pros:-Accessible, simple control scheme-Surprisingly fun pitching controls-Awesome player names-Pleasant graphics, nice colorsCons:-No online multiplayer-If you're one of the stat-crazy sabremetric baseball fans, this game may not give you your crazy stat crack fix-The controls may be too simplistic for some-A narrow selection of stadiums			"

												I've played about 10 games between exhibition, local multiplayer, and season play, and it absolutely holds up.  It's a nice departure from the exact science of an MVP/2K sim without the half-finished feel of RBI Baseball.  The gameplay feels like Backyard Baseball for an older audience and plays really well with a controller.  It has surprising depth, especially at the higher Ego levels, but was still simple enough for someone who has never played a baseball game before to pick up and play.I like the atmosphere of the game, keeping things fun without going over-the-top trying to be hilarious.  The ball physics are impressive -- it's not unusual to get 7-10 pitch at-bats by fouling pitches away, and I had one particularly memorable instance where a bunt started foul and rolled fair.  Pitching is immersive and rewarding, requiring you to really think or risk getting hit hard from being predictable, and requires a bit more skill than simply point-and-click without relying on ridiculous stick gestures.  The Ego system is a unique and, I think, well-executed approach to the difficulty system, letting you individually tweak different aspects of gameplay to make the game challenging without being unforgiving.The game isn't without flaws, though, and arguably the biggest one is that fielding can feel a little sluggish.  The right stick is used for diving/jumping plays, and isn't as smooth or responsive as even MVP's controls were.  The players tend to automatically wander towards the ball, but there's not a ball indicator or catch circle to go off, so there are times where you feel like you're at the mercy of the RNG gods.  You also don't have a lot of control in customizing the game -- the team names, logos, and player attributes are all untouchable, but you are able to customize the players' appearance to give it at least some of your personal touch.  The inability to even change the players' handedness is a little disappointing.All in all, this is an incredibly fun game right out of the box.  It handles well and strikes a nice balance between realism and arcade-like fun, and I think a few well-placed tweaks could really put it over the top.  9/10 and an absolute steal for $15-20.			"

												Fantastic! I'm not really a fan of the actual sport but I enjoy some of the videogames (less so the more realistic simulations). This one has the nice arcadey quickness that I like while still providing enough control and player management others might be looking for. The individual difficulty adjusters for each aspect of the game (pitching, batting, etc.) is a great addition that allows you to enjoy the parts you like and breeze through what you don't feel comfortable with.Some people might be turned off by the character designs but I like them, especially with their reactions when they get struck out. Plus the customization gives you more wackiness.The only negatives have been repeated in other reviews and is the lack of a practice mode for pitching/batting, other than playing an actual game.Definitely a must buy if you have even just a slight interest in baseball.

												Seems arcadish at first glance based on how zany it is however this game has all of the proper elements in place for a fun baseball game. Rotating starting pitchers and upgrading coaches are a few of the additional elements to career mode in which you play the season. It has the standard gameplay elements of baseball games, batting you aim a cursor and try to properly time the swing. For pitching you try to hit your mark to pitch accurately and with velocity. Attributes are very basic and easy to understand. Velocity/Junk for pitchers, speed/hit/power for batters and fielding for playing the field. The game indeed has physics so there aren't any nasty surprises when you don't connect well on a swing. You can also alter any player's appearance and name which can give them additional character. Definitely a recommended game for anyone looking for a simple, fun baseball game.			"

												Outstanding baseball game that is a lot more than meets the eye. The pitching and hitting mechanics are as good as any baseball sim and it will scratch the itch of super casual and hardcore baseball gamers. It does lack a lot of the stat tracking and normal gameplay options you would find in normal baseball games (no pitch outs, no pick off​ moves, etc) but the things that are included are implemented, presented and executed at an above avg level.What really makes this game appeal to casual and hardcore and all in between is the way difficulty is handled. You choose from 0-99 with 99 obviously being the toughest. A few points tweaked either way can mean the difference between a fair challenge, a walk in the park, or a flat out RNG laced tirade mixed with occasional rage quits. Luckily the sweet spot can always be adjusted as your skill level goes up even between in season games. This in my mind is groundbreaking and it should be adopted in every sports game in my opinion and it's one of the main reasons there is so much replay value in this game.Overall I highly recommend this title and don't get caught up in the 'arcade' reviews of this. Yes the art is cartoonish and the animations are not the most realistic, but this game is a chameleon. It can be an arcade game for some and a sim experience for others, give or take a few things.Pros- Pitching and hitting mechanics are top notch. Incredible- Very nice team upgrade system in season mode- Mojo system where players become hot or cold and perform poorly or above avg if the game pressure is high. Slumps and hot streaks happen based on this system.- Team appearances fully customizable- Most major stats tracked (not all)- Short Med Long Season- Difficulty setting should be blueprint for all games to followCons- Lots of normal baseball plays ommited from the game like pitchouts and pick offs.- No online co op- Players not proportioned to the size of the field. - Sometimes runners hold up on balls that will clearly not be caught. This can cost you some runs before you get used to adjusting to this.If you are a baseball fan and refuse to buy a PS4​ this is a must buy. No need to wait for a sale.			"

												I just got this game today and I have already played for 2 hours straight. I can already tell how fun of a game this will be for me. I love baseball, and I was waiting for a good baseball game to come to Steam. Although this game isn't licensed by MLB, and thus does not have real players or anything, it's still really fun. Don't be discouraged from buying it due to the cartoon art, as it has real baseball mechanics, the controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay is fun overall. I was quite surprised with the fact that you could even customize the players on your team. I was glad to be able to change my center fielder's name to Mike Trout and (try to) make him look like him. Of course, certain things can still be improved. On the first game I played, I somehow scored 10 runs and got a no hitter against the opposing team with no prior experience. I still have to experiment with whether raising the difficulty, called ego, will make a difference in making the game less easy. I won't hold this against the game, however, as in most baseball games you can score an impossible amount of points easily, but that doesn't make the game less fun. As for bugs, I've already ran into one where my game crashed at the end of the 9th inning, which I then used that time to come here and write this review. If you love baseball I would certainly recommend this game to you.			"

												While The Show on PS4 tries to constantly be the most realistic baseball game, this game throws all that out the window in order to concentrate on fun.Don't get me wrong, the game is still realistic to an extent. The game plays like it should, and outside catching pop fly balls, you'll be in control of everything from pitches, swings, base control, and outfield control. It's just that the game focuses more on ease of use, something The Show fails at (in my eyes). This makes the game far easier to control than The Show, and thus is much more fun.Coupled with some funny characters, great looking stadiums, and some rediculous team names with the ability to change the team names for a custom team, the game is lighthearted, easy to play but challenging on higher difficulties, and a blast to play with friends.In fact, that's the only downside. The game still has no online play. There are leaderboards, but it's just not as fun as playing with the person in real time. If this would be added, it would GREATLY help the game. But if you can live with playing against bots, or if you have friends in the same room, the game is an absolute joy and one you shouldn't pass up just because of the cartoony look.This is a great baseball game through and through. Fully recommended.			"

												Not since Baseball Stars for NES have I enjoyed a baseball game this much.  The developers should be proud of themselves.  I think one of the greatest features this has is that it moves very quickly.  A 9 inning game only takes about 10-15 minutes to play.  Very very little time inbetween pitches, between batters and between innings.  Development of the players skills is done very creatively.  Hitting is challenging, pitching is interesting and choosing a fielders action is seamless.  If I were to change anything, I would give full control of the fielders movement to the player.  Fly balls are caught automatically, but what you do with the ball afterwards is entirely up to you.  9.5/10  If you've been waiting for a baseball game that you can't WAIT to play again, and play through an entire season without a minute of boredom, then get this game.  You won't regret it.			"

												I absolutely love this game.  This will let me delete MLB The Show from my PS4 to save some space.This is the perfect balance of Arcade and realisism that has been missing since RBI Baseball (that's NES RBI Baseball, not the reboot).  The games are fast paced, but there's a surprising amount of depth.  The pitching control is fun, but moreso it's great that they've worked the AI so that your pitch selection is equally important.  Batting is entertaining, though some of the base stealing controls can be a bit much when you're first getting into the game.Honestly, an MLB-licesned version of this would be my dream baseball game -- but as is, it's still very much worth the money.Edit:  The one issue I've found with the game is ""in-betweener"" infield hits.  I've lost two late-game no-hitters to either soft chops that landed between the pitcher and catcher, or soft grounders that went to the bermuda triangle of field coverage that is the area between the 1st baseman, pitcher, and 2nd baseman.  In these situations, all fields will soft charge, stall, soft charge, etc -- no one quickly gets to the ball.  It's wose in the 1st base situation, because the pitcher will frequently start running towards the base to cover 1st (as they should), but then back off and work back towards the ball.    Just putting this out here in case the devs ever check this feedback.			"

												Fanstastic Baseball Gaming on the PC!!  ...finally!-----------------------tldr;  awesome fun game from the first minute of play... more depth and upgradeability after you get your initial fix.------------------------This game really is awesome.  I've been waiting for years and years for a baseball game on the PC.  I'm not a console gamer so I've been saddened by the lack of anything worth playing in the PC world.  Well here is a truly great title that I was able to jump into and start playing immediately.  I could hardly believe pitching, hitting and fielding on my PC, and I was doing so successfully within the first 1 minute after installation.  You can jump right into this game with no studying ahead of time... the game teaches you as you actually play with pointers here and there in your 1st game.   The mechanics of pitching are fantastic and deep and the hitting is equally fun and challenging.  I have the difficulty setting set very low right now so fielding is pretty simple but I'm going to turn up the difficulty soon and gradually increase my challenge.After getting my fix on the first few games I started poking around I discovered some real depth with the ability to hire managers and use different manager bonuses to ""customize/improve"" specific skills on different players on my team.  Manager bonuses allow you to upgrade different player's stats such as power, fielding, mojo (mental strength and confidence), running speed, throwing power, etc etc..  Different managers have different bonuses that they can bring to your team if you hire them.  Each manager has a bonus that can be used on 3 different players and players have bonus upgrade slots... but not all players have all possible upgrade slots.  There is still more for me to explore here.  The point is there is depth to this game and it makes a difference to gameplay.----			"

Played a few exhibition-games in order to fully understand the rules and mechanics and then I started a season, which I'm currently enjoying a lot.So, pros and cons of this game would be:PROS:- Decent range of customization options.- Very smooth learning curve, yet hard to master at the higher EGO levels.- A difficulty that can be tailored at any time as you progress in the game.- Simple yet nice visuals.- Addicting gameplay.CONS:- No online multiplayer.- No saving mid-match.- Can't rename teams or change their logo/gear.Verdict: Awesome game that may seem overpriced at first, yet totally worth the price to anyone who likes arcade-style sports game. 9 out of 10 home-runs for sure!

												It's so refreshing to see a sports game developed by people who put their heart and soul (you can really tell) into it because they love the game.  Can't say the same about the big name sports titles that get regurgitated every year by corporate drones.  On the surface, this game harkens back to RBI Baseball, Baseball Stars, and Ken Griffey Jr baseball.  Beneath the surface, though, is where it really shines.  The physics are remarkably accurate and repeatable, and the team management system is almost as fun as the gameplay in terms of balancing strengths/weaknesses and deciding exactly what kind of team you want to take the field.  Difficulty is user-managed by the EGO system (1-99), which determines not only how well the CPU will play but also how good your joystick skills will need to be to pitch/hit your way to victory.  I can't recommend this game enough for baseball fans of all types.  It isn't just for older fans of the aforementioned games.  Rather, it should appeal to fans of almost any age or gaming desire other than hardcore simulation.			"

												This game is really good. The lack of online multiplayer doesn't even matter because the AI difficulty system is so perfect. You can set the difficulty to any number between 1 and 100. I'm currently finding around 55 difficulty to be perfect for me (I win ~60% of the time maybe), but that number is always increasing as I get better. It's so refreshing to play a game against bots that isn't soul crushingly difficult or walk in the park easy. It's probably even more fun than playing against people online because the games are just so close when you find the right difficulty number! And I don't think it's really possible to be good enough to find the maximum difficulty easy, so don't worry about that. Really happy with this game.			"

												Let me preface this review by stating that I am a baseball fanatic. In fact, I believe I am the only person in the United States that follows baseball and no other sport. I am a student of the history of the game - especially the Dead Ball Era. As such, I have played every ""serious"" baseball sim with mainstays being OOTP and Baseball Mogul.I've been looking for a fun arcade type baseball game. In the glory days of the C64 and Amiga it was Hardball, MicroLeague Baseball and Earl Weaver baseball - the latter a decent strategy sim. My best friend and I used to stay up all night playing Hardball on the C64. I tried other arcade titles such as Star League Baseball, and The Show. None of these could touch the sheer fun of the first iteration of Hardball - until now.Super Mega Baseball Extra Innings - known for the rest of this review as SMBEI - has completely captivated me. There are no trades, the longest season is only 40 games, there are limited substitutions, and the game looks like a nice little game forkids. But, don't be misled by these observations. SMBEI is a well done representation of baseball in an arcade format. Developer Metalhead have put a lot of love into this game and it shows. The game plays very well with KB and mouse even though the devs recommend a controller.There is a visceral feeling to hitting the ball and pitching is a blast. The cartoon aesthetic may put some potential gamers off but, this is really quite a serious baseball game. The parks look fantastic, the fans are hilarious, and the cusomization is pretty good.Difficulty level is determined by a mechanism nown as ""ego."" The higher the number, the more challenging the game is. And I would strongly suggest that after a few games to ratchet up the ego rating for a real challenge.All of that said, there isn't complete joy in Mudville.You cannot create your own teams, bench and bullpen are very limited and while replayability is good, it could be better with more teams as well as an option to import stats from the free Sean Lahman Baseball Database.It's the perfect baseball game to play when you aren' feeling up to the intricacies of games like Baseball Mogul and OOTP. Hardball has been dethroned; SMBEI is the new king. Long live the kin!			"

												I really like this game. I was looking for a baseball game I can play season mode and I get this and more. I enjoy playing season modes in baseball not only to see if I can make it to the play offs and win but to see stats stack up during the season. How will each player has done for me through it all. This game not only gives me that but as you play consecutive seasons your over all stats are added together. I am right now in the middle of my second season in this game and I can see how many home runs I have hit, how many times I have struck out, how many pitches I have thrown how many double and triple plays I have made and on and on. I love this!The difficulty setting is something I have not seen. I am use to difficulty settings of something along the lines of ""Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard""  In this game your  difficulty is based on your EGO number. The higher the number the more difficult the game will become. It offers a grander scale to work with based on your desire so it is actually easier to find a good difficulty level for you than any other baseball game. (That I have played that is). Which brings me to my next thought, I was hesitant on buying this game, because I usually find in baseball games that you can create a team and just power slug fest your way through, having scores of 40-0 lol Its fun sure for awhile but then there is no difficulty and becomes boring after awhile. WIth the difficulty system you can avoid this problem. I have 2 things that I do not like about this game. The season is really short even on the longest length. 48 games. I can over look that though, it is just sad though. The biggest issue I found in this game, and it may just be me, but the controls on the keyboard. Have mercy I had such a hard time trying to adjust and use it that I finally got a game controller LOL. I recommend this game w/ controller!			"

												It's so refreshing to see a sports game developed by people who put their heart and soul (you can really tell) into it because they love the game.  Can't say the same about the big name sports titles that get regurgitated every year by corporate drones.  On the surface, this game harkens back to RBI Baseball, Baseball Stars, and Ken Griffey Jr baseball.  Beneath the surface, though, is where it really shines.  The physics are remarkably accurate and repeatable, and the team management system is almost as fun as the gameplay in terms of balancing strengths/weaknesses and deciding exactly what kind of team you want to take the field.  Difficulty is user-managed by the EGO system (1-99), which determines not only how well the CPU will play but also how good your joystick skills will need to be to pitch/hit your way to victory.  I can't recommend this game enough for baseball fans of all types.  It isn't just for older fans of the aforementioned games.  Rather, it should appeal to fans of almost any age or gaming desire other than hardcore simulation.			"

												BTW, this is Becky's 30 year-old high-functioning autistic son Travis writing this review.Don't let the cartoony grapchics fool you, this is a true gem of a basebal sim considering its only baseball competiton on Steam is the R.B.I. Baseball which is OK gameplay but ths game has it beat by a long shot. Super Mega Baseball: extra Innings could be 1 of the biggest suprise PC games of the past 5 years IMO. From the game's cartoon-like graphics & stadiums to customizale player names this game will go down as 1 of the best sports games of the centruy IMO. This game reminds of a cross between R.B.I. Baseball for the NES & somewhat of a G-rated Mutant League series on the Sega Genesisi with the blood & violence. I'm giving Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings a definite 9.5 out of 10!!!!			"

												Outstanding baseball game that is a lot more than meets the eye. The pitching and hitting mechanics are as good as any baseball sim and it will scratch the itch of super casual and hardcore baseball gamers. It does lack a lot of the stat tracking and normal gameplay options you would find in normal baseball games (no pitch outs, no pick off​ moves, etc) but the things that are included are implemented, presented and executed at an above avg level.What really makes this game appeal to casual and hardcore and all in between is the way difficulty is handled. You choose from 0-99 with 99 obviously being the toughest. A few points tweaked either way can mean the difference between a fair challenge, a walk in the park, or a flat out RNG laced tirade mixed with occasional rage quits. Luckily the sweet spot can always be adjusted as your skill level goes up even between in season games. This in my mind is groundbreaking and it should be adopted in every sports game in my opinion and it's one of the main reasons there is so much replay value in this game.Overall I highly recommend this title and don't get caught up in the 'arcade' reviews of this. Yes the art is cartoonish and the animations are not the most realistic, but this game is a chameleon. It can be an arcade game for some and a sim experience for others, give or take a few things.Pros- Pitching and hitting mechanics are top notch. Incredible- Very nice team upgrade system in season mode- Mojo system where players become hot or cold and perform poorly or above avg if the game pressure is high. Slumps and hot streaks happen based on this system.- Team appearances fully customizable- Most major stats tracked (not all)- Short Med Long Season- Difficulty setting should be blueprint for all games to followCons- Lots of normal baseball plays ommited from the game like pitchouts and pick offs.- No online co op- Players not proportioned to the size of the field. - Sometimes runners hold up on balls that will clearly not be caught. This can cost you some runs before you get used to adjusting to this.If you are a baseball fan and refuse to buy a PS4​ this is a must buy. No need to wait for a sale.			"

												Yeah, do not scoff at this game because of it's arcade style looks. This game is hardcore. I jacked up my ego from 30 (when I was slapping the ball all over the yard) to 45 and it's much harder. I love it. It's fun, challenging and the gameplay is tight. I've played lots of baseball games and the physics in this one is up there with the best. Not to mention I can play with my kid and balance the difficulty with the ego system. Great game.			"

												Seems arcadish at first glance based on how zany it is however this game has all of the proper elements in place for a fun baseball game. Rotating starting pitchers and upgrading coaches are a few of the additional elements to career mode in which you play the season. It has the standard gameplay elements of baseball games, batting you aim a cursor and try to properly time the swing. For pitching you try to hit your mark to pitch accurately and with velocity. Attributes are very basic and easy to understand. Velocity/Junk for pitchers, speed/hit/power for batters and fielding for playing the field. The game indeed has physics so there aren't any nasty surprises when you don't connect well on a swing. You can also alter any player's appearance and name which can give them additional character. Definitely a recommended game for anyone looking for a simple, fun baseball game.			"

												I'm not a sports fan by any measure. But what I do like is local multiplayer games, especially head-to-head type, but co-op as well. This scratches that itch! Easy to get into and start a game with a friend. My only complaint is season mode isn't the same as exhibition, you can't play a season versus your friend.But, if Metalhead Software releases more sports games that are just as good and easy to play as this, SIGN ME UP! I'd beat down your door if you come out with a football game that was done with this art style but in the mode of Tecmo Bowl. Other sports would be welcome too. Hell, do the Olympics with lots of different sports as mini-games and I'd buy that day and date.			"

												Bought this game out of boredom, expected to not understand a single thing and refund it within 2 hours. Instead I ended up playing for way too long. SMB is an awesome arcade-style baseball game, suitable for baseball fanatics and people who don't know anything about the sport at all (such as myself). Played a few exhibition-games in order to fully understand the rules and mechanics and then I started a season, which I'm currently enjoying a lot.So, pros and cons of this game would be:PROS:- Decent range of customization options.- Very smooth learning curve, yet hard to master at the higher EGO levels.- A difficulty that can be tailored at any time as you progress in the game.- Simple yet nice visuals.- Addicting gameplay.CONS:- No online multiplayer.- No saving mid-match.- Can't rename teams or change their logo/gear.Verdict: Awesome game that may seem overpriced at first, yet totally worth the price to anyone who likes arcade-style sports game. 9 out of 10 home-runs for sure!

												Fantastic! I'm not really a fan of the actual sport but I enjoy some of the videogames (less so the more realistic simulations). This one has the nice arcadey quickness that I like while still providing enough control and player management others might be looking for. The individual difficulty adjusters for each aspect of the game (pitching, batting, etc.) is a great addition that allows you to enjoy the parts you like and breeze through what you don't feel comfortable with.Some people might be turned off by the character designs but I like them, especially with their reactions when they get struck out. Plus the customization gives you more wackiness.The only negatives have been repeated in other reviews and is the lack of a practice mode for pitching/batting, other than playing an actual game.Definitely a must buy if you have even just a slight interest in baseball.

												Seriously one of the greatest dark horses in the Steam Market right now. Steam is often to tied up to DotA 2 and CS:GO, but I urge everyone to just slow things down with a game of baseball or two with this game. If anyone grew up as a 90s kid will remember Backyard Baseball and this feels like a great upgrade from that. Nothing wacky here, but good ol' baseball. This game keeps my winter starvation away until the Spring Training season comes around. I definitely recommend buying an XBox 360 controller to play it. I did find using Keyboard+Mouse to be a little challenging at times where I had trouble throwing to the correct cut-off relay. Otherwise the mojo and pressure aspects make it fun and add slight wrinkles to player's effectiveness. This obvious becomes more recognizable at higher difficulties. Core UI and game interfaces is similar to MLB The Show. However you don't need to play a 162 game season. You're able to make things super casual and make uber short seasons. I highly encourage people to play all the teams as they start off with their own flavor. If you're confident in certain elements, you can try particular teams that cater to that and helps you learn the mechanic. I chose the Blowfish because I wasn't spot on with hitting. They're contact specialists. There's a team for anyone and everyone. If you not confident in fielding, there's a defensive team that can aid you as you develop your memory for this game. The only con I see for now is the depth of the team. There's about 5 bench position players (don't forget to upgrade them with your para-coaching staff). That's not bad. However at least for the Blowfish...there's only three relievers. AAAH!!! and the closer in my opinion isn't all that hot with this stuff. EEEKK!!! I guess my suggestion is make sure you take care of your pitchers and don't tire them out. Sure getting K's is nice, but an out is an out. I found CGs are gold in playing the season-long play mode.Playing this game since Christmas up to now (March 2017), I think it's a must-buy or must-gift to baseball fans that want to not play the usual popular Steam titles. Pick up a couple copies to allow for multiplayer. I can't comment on that just yet since I haven't found someone to play with.			"

												I still have Ken Griffery Jr baseball on the SNES and I belive the majority of people who played that SNES style of baseball will easily say that that might still be the best arcade baseball game.  So that is a very high standard set for arcade style baseball.  Does Super Mega Baseball meet that very high stanadard?KGJR baseball played fast and so does this game.KGJR baseball pitching was fun to control and so does this game.The hitting mechanics in Super Mega Baseball > KGJR baseball.You can adjust the difficulty by chaning the EGO number whereas in KGJR baseball, you were limited.And they are making Super Mega Baseball 2 as of this typing.I have a 3 GHZ Pentinum dual core CPU along with a Nvidia GT 730 1 GB GDDR5 GPU and I can play this game maxed out.Will I need Ken Griffery Jr baseball for the SNES after this?  Only for nostaglia purposes and it is going to collect dust until it ends up at a pawn store, a thrift store, or used game store.  Too bad they didn't port for the PS Vita like they said they would have done and it doesn't seem like Super Mega Baseball 2 is going portable as far as I know which is a darn shame.  Maybe a good Windows 10 tablet might do the trick here.			"

												This game has been the perfect baseball game for me. Filling the void in the gaming world left by backyard baseball, Super Mega Baseball is a suberb game that has some of the most intense moments of any video game I have ever played. The difficulty system allows for players of different skill levels to faily compete, and makes the game much more enjoyable, learnable, and challenging. The replay value is very high, as no two games are ever the same, and I often find myself forgetting that the characters on my team are not real people. That is, I think, a testament to the strength of this game and the way that Metalhead (devs) really made the game feel real. Another strength of this game is the ability for co-op and PVP. Playing with your friends (up to 4 players total) really feels clean and well put together. It is also very fun, especially in the era of diminishing couch co-op. The steam controller is also great for this game. The developers are great, and respond quickly to support requests and are active in the various communities surrounding this game. I highly reccomend it to anyone looking to play some baseball.			"

												This game has been the perfect baseball game for me. Filling the void in the gaming world left by backyard baseball, Super Mega Baseball is a suberb game that has some of the most intense moments of any video game I have ever played. The difficulty system allows for players of different skill levels to faily compete, and makes the game much more enjoyable, learnable, and challenging.

												I'm a huge baseball fan, and a huge PC gaming fan. Every since I've been on steam, I'd been sad to see no good baseball games come to the platform. When I found out about this game, it was an instant buy (even though I'm trying to save money and play the games I already own!) Well, now I can only think of playing this until I can't anymore. I love getting attached to my team and getting that difficulty just right to where the games make my heart race almost every time, with the occasional domination win providing much relief. If you like baseball and are on the fence about this one, do it. You won't regret it!			"
