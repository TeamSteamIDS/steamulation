												Who didn’t play games similar to 3 Coins at School when you were going to school? I know I did and there were plenty of different variances of those types of games that my peers and I loved to play. Therefore when I saw that the game was released onto Steam I was immediately interested in seeing if I could rekindle some of my favorite school year memories. I wasn’t expecting anything but that opportunity.Let’s get the technical issues out of the way first before I can get to the meat and potatoes point of my review. The game works as intended. The graphics aren’t pretty and I would have liked to see them improved upon but if they are nothing else they are serviceable. The game play mechanics work though I would have liked a better tutorial than just rules so that players could learn the game a little faster – though it has to be said that it is simple. I found it impossible to find a multiplayer game which isn’t surprising and there is no local multiplayer option. But why would you really need a local option because if you wanted to play all you’d need to do is get a few coins.So my problem with the game…. Playing against the computer opponent is a relatively boring experience. It’s a time waster and not in a good way. It’s impossible to rekindle the memories of playing these types of games with friends at school because when all is said and done you’re not necessarily playing because you love the game, you’re playing because you love spending time with friends. You’re playing to spend the six to eight hours a day that you need to be at school in the most social ways possible. You probably even played these types of games because you were bored and you played mind numbing games to get those hours done with.A game like this without playing with active people who you can laugh and talk with just isn’t a fulfilling experience. That is no disrespect to the devs at 89AM Studio and I appreciate their efforts in trying but ultimately they developed a sadly unnecessary game.			"

												So I guess there's this weird school game kids play with three coins, hence the name, where you try to flick coins at another kid and score goals between their fingers.  Weird.   Seems ok.			"

												Playing this game in real life can be fun. Playing this game on PC can be fun also. Playing this game as it is made by 89AM Studio is not fun.You have 4 options to play. Singleplayer with 3 difficulties and a multiplayer. Multiplayer is dead. Singleplayer has pretty bad AI. Even on hard difficulty AI seems to be able to use only two moves, repeating them randomly each round. Easy to beat. Nothing interesting, nothing exciting. You know where PC will shoot beforehand. Quite sad that this is released for 5 € as a finished game. In state where it is it offers like 5 minutes of gameplay, maybe less. Pretty expensive minutes of gameplay. Even for free. Btw, why the hell this game needs to download 500 MB if it is so light and incomplete?! Someone can download this game longer than will actually play ^_^			"

												3 Coins At School is a game about shooting coins into the other players/bots goal. yeah.. That's it...Pro's:- It's orginal- Eeehm.... T-there is music?....Cons:- Its WAY too expensive, a better price would be 0,80€.- The game has bad quality textures, it looks terrible.- The background people are just looking forward. Like if they are made from stone...- The game only entertains you for like 10 minutes. - Why would you play a game for on school on your computer? The game in real only cost 2 euro and 80 cents to play. This one 5 euro....Conclusion:Terrible. I wouldn't recommend you this game. It's too expensive and it only entertains for 10 minutes. Don't buy it. If you do like this then do it in real life.Do you want me to review your game?:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Archmeton/My sponsor:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SirAlexandersClub "

												I would really not like to ♥♥♥♥ on games because I know developers took time and energy to make them, but this game is complete trash. The concept of this game might be something fun you can play in real life, but the way this game makes it is just so bad I can't even... All of my additional hours are just to get the steam trading card drops so don't be mislead.To start, the only thing you can do in this game is play their idea. There's nothing else and multiplayer is 100% dead. The gameplay is also both very edgy and not fine tuned at all. There is no direction arrow, there is no option to lower speed, the AI looks like they just generated a random 3D model, when a goal is blocked, there are the most unnatural physics, and your ""middle"" finger bends like the most unnatural thing ever. Nothing about the gameplay is fine tuned. Remember that this game costs ♥♥♥♥ing FIVE DOLLARS at full price. I have no clue what this developer is thinking because this game is worth 20 cents the most.The only good thing I can think to say about this game is that it has a nice menu soundtrack, although it gets repetitive pretty fast. Also like I said before, the game's concept could be something you can play in real life, although I probably wouldn't be playing it anymore.Overall, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game presented at a real high price. I would not recommend this game to anyone because there is no fun playing it at all.Rating: 3.8/10Recommend Price: Under $0.20 (for steam trading cards)			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Way overpriced game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some different resolution sizes.You are able to change the Music volume by 10 each time.You are able to change the Ambient volume by 10 each time.You are able to change the Voices volume by 10 each time.Multiplayer is only online. But it's dead.There are Rules/instructions about the game.There is a difficulty settings.About the game.You are on school and you are shooting coins to the other side of the table. The opponent will do the same as you and players are taking turns. If one of the 3 coins are fallen off the table. Your turn will end. You can shoot 3 times and you have to shoot between the finger goals of the opponent. There is also a time limit, if you havent shot within the time. Your turn will be over. The game is sooo bad, that you are even able to make a goal without in finger reach. There is a red Line on the other side. If you have crossed over the red line and you are shooting, You will miss a turn.Unlogical finger movements.Bad graphics.Boring game.No progressing.There is a time limit.Other things.Game is way too overpriced than it has too offer! I should say 1$ or less is enough for this game.Alt tabbing crashes the game.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10			"

												At $5.5 this is overpriced. The game itself is simple enough. Reminds me of Knuckles from high school. Has trading cards, but I only got about 10 minutes of entertainment out of it. No pain, no game.			"

												3 Coins At School is kind of game that would be fun to play in multiplayer. Sure, it's nothing fancy, just a simple something that probably everyone of us played at the school. There is just thing that destroys everything - NOBODY's playing it. You can beat computer on different difficulty levels the same way without any trouble. But what after that? I haven't managed to find any real opponent. The most of the time I spend on getting cards, not playing. And this price tag... 4.99€ for a game that wouldn't make it big even as free flash game. It's just a waste of money, and if you somehow own it - don't waste your time and space on hard drive.PS.Why the ocean!? "

												Pros:Pretty good for the price.A game to play when bored.It's interestingIt has online multiplayerCons:The music is a bit repetitive. Not bad, but it needs more music.Needs something to keep you playing, maybe unlockable coins.Needs leaderboards (Wins, Losses, Goals)Overall:Can't complain, especially for the price.			"
