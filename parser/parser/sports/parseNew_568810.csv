												Yesterday I would have said that this is a great game, it has great direction and potential, but now I see that the developers are pretty much the same masterminds behind their previous Freestyle game.  And when I say masterminds I mean they charge 30 dollars for a character - which has significant stat advantages and is unobtainable without paying.Pros:+Character Customization+Decent Community+Skill Intensive+Can't Gain Significant Edge Through PayingCons:-50%+ of Content Microtransactions-F2P Content Is Lame(for the most part your character won't look unique unless you drop 40$+ on the game)-Goalies are AI and inconsistent at that.  Literally have watched a 3 point lead blown because the goalie stared at the ball.-80% of the community doesn't pass the ball-90% of Defenders don't know how to tackle-Everyone Plays Striker, No one is good at it-Developers Change Event Rewards at will-Overwhelming number of South American players.  No South American Server(which is in high demand and sure to come).-Game existed 2 years ago and eventually went under.A little extra on that last Con, and which was ultimately the last straw for me and this game.  Yesterday you were able to obtain E-Coins which are temporary versions of the irl currency alot of the microtransactions of the game go on.  Yesterday there was also several oppurtunities to unlock the 30$ characters - which was exclusive through a temporary two month long event.  However without any news, warning, or statement whatsoever the game decided to change the first 5 game of the day reward from 150 e-coins to a 1000 points(which to put into perspective is about two games, or 12 minutes) - Basically locking over 50% of the content in the game from the free to play community.  Overall I think the level 48 reward that existed(and was also changed) which gave the player 3000 e-coins(30$) was overwhelming, and they have pushed it to a level 56 reward to unlock 1000 e-coins, which is essentially a single premium stat item.  Ultimately it is a free to play game and developers have the right to charge whatever they want for whatever they deem should become a microtransaction and I respect that.  Overall the game doesn't punish the f2p players, seeing as every stat-based item has a free equivilent, however there is little incentive in the game to work towards.  If you don't want to drop 20 dollars in the game the max you will be able to do is kick a curve ball and have an afro - maybe eventually having a shirt if you decide to drop 30+ hours into the game to get a level 56 character.  However even then small portion of content will be unavailable because e-coins dissappear after seven days meaning to unlock a free character you'd need to get 3 characters to level 56 within a 7 day period.(like storing 3 of them at level 55 and getting that last level for all of them at once) - but seeing as they have already done random changes to the game to prevent players from getting free characters, it wouldn't surprise me if they decide to change the game again upon reading my review.   Ultimately if you're looking for a game to play with a few friends and kill a few minutes out of your day, this is your stop.  If you are looking for a game to actually pour some time into I'd recommend spending money on a different game up front.  I'd give the game a 6/10.  If they add a SA server and make goalies slightly customizable so as to be more consistent, less luck based, and not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times - the game would be an 8/10.  If they hadn't of screwed over the event-rewards and proved themselves to have a disconnect with the community, the game would be an 8/10.  If both of those existed, the game would be 10/10 perfect - seeing as all content would be unlockable, the playerbase would be consistent with its locaton(meaning less lag in matches), and goalies would be consistent so as not to tip games in the favor of whichever sides goalie isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(because nothinig says victory like your goalie catching uncatchable balls but the enemies goalie literally ducking to avoid the ball).Final Score: 6/10Developer Score: 3/10Would I play this game: With FriendsWould I pay in this game: NoEsport Capability: Not LikelyAudio: 8/10(Audio Queues are Useful)Gameplay: 5/10(Goalie AI sucks, Lag)Graphics: 7/10(Cartoony Art Style)Music: 8/10(Tight Soundtrack - Probably best part about the game is the rap soundtrack)Replay Value: 4/10(No Incentive for F2P players; Pay to look cool, not play to look cool.)

												I know people are going to get super offended by this, but they need to IP block Brazil and other south american countries from the US servers. Otherwise, it's a very fun game.(This has nothing to do with Brazilians or how they play. It's a matter of lag and bad pings. I got nothing against South American players. You guys just need your own server)			"

												Game is kind of fun for a while, interesting concept, you thrive and enjoy evolving your player level after level, understanding how the game works and such, until you start realizing how everything works.Eventually, after a while, you start realizing a couple of things that for me are game breaking, and thus, making it unplayable and unrecommendable. Here are the negative aspects (in no particular order):1. OffsideThe game's offside rule is extremely bugged. In many cases, the player is so ahead of your teams last defender, there's not a shroud of doubt whether it should be offside or not. This will happen a lot, and you will suffer a lot of stupid game breaking goals like this.The opposite also sometimes happen, your player is ingame and yet you have the ""offside"" label on the top of your head.2. TackleTo tackle in this game you need a couple of things: good stats, good positioning, luck. The amount of randomness in this action is so staggering that you sometimes tackle and ask yourself how was it even possible. Other times, you'll be standing right in front of your oponnent, and all your attempts to tackle will simply not work. It's too much stat/random dependent and little skill involved (apart from positioning and timing the tackle).3. GoalkeepersSometimes, goalkeepers are plain unexisting. You'll have games in which every shot will go right through the keeper. Others in which is just impossible to score.4. Pay to WinYes. He who spends more money will always have advantage over you. Items can only be bought using gold (obtainable only by using real cash) and items/chars can be quite expensive for such a dull game. I actually decided to spend 5$ to get points, but here (again) there's randomness in the way you can get points. You can get from 1.000 points up to 100.000 points. Guess what's the odds of getting the highest amount ...Overall, the game feels like i'm not in true control of my player. There's a lot of randomness involved that takes all the joy out of it. In some games, your player will do great (achieving mvp) others you'll be crap. Problem is, in both cases, you feel it's too much random...The only good thing i can say about the game is the community and clubs. Met great fellas there and the club is probably the only that makes come back from time to time.(forgive my english)			"

												Easy version if u want a fast review, and more detailed review is at the end. 7/10 score for me.Pros:Fun TEAMWORK gameNot that p2wRather stable host compare to other games ( EU server )A lot of eventsCharacter customization Cons:Special characters are way overpricedPlayer base is smallLeague system needs a reworkDetailed Pros:This game requires teamwork, a lot of people say that random players don't pass the ball that's why this game sucks, everygame has begginers and noobs and people with more ego, you simply have to be patient and wait to meet more skilled or players that work well with your game style.Some people say this game is P2W, it's not THAT much of a p2w game. The characters u can buy with money do provide higher stats, like the 39 USD Ginger has +27 stats, but this does not mean you as a free player can not beat them. You as free player can also buy gears which gives stats, it's just you need to grind some points for them, and by grind i don't mean u need to play 5 hours a day to get those. Not to mention you will also get e coins for different events.Some people complain about server, i'm from EU server and so far i only had two dc from the game, one of them was the server dc. Sometimes you dc because of your own internet, not the server, and to be fair they are providing a pretty stabled server already.God bless there is no card system yet like fssb2, i say YET because i do not know if they will change it later. If they start with this card system, that is the point where this game becomes p2w.Events, right now in the game there are two events, it seems like they will keep giving you new events when the current ones go out. this is something i like.Character customization, even tho a lot of the gears requires coins or e coins, but there are few gears you can buy with points, and like i said you can get e coins from events, so it's not that bad.Detailed cons:29 USD for Rachel and Dirk, 39 USD for Ginger. I've played a lot of games, but this price setting is way too overpriced for a game with such small playerbase. In one of the reviews, GM said you will get a free special char when u reach lv 52 for the event, this is NOT true, because you have to roll it, you might get exp and other stuff, it is NOT secured to get a special char once you reach lv 52. When we talk about this, i have to point out if even the GM can not give currect information, it is nothing but a failed service.Playerbase, the current playerbase is really small, it is next to impossible to find a league game in the morning, but i do think since this game is on Steam now, it will get better.League system, when you join a club, you can play league games with your premade club mate to win league points for your club. However, if you win, you get 3 points, if it's a draw you get 1 point, if you lose, you get 0. This means a club doesn't have to be good, but you can just zerg it to get to the top. Ofc being no.1 in rank doesn't mean you are best player, but it should not be like this, when you lose, you should lose some points instead of just get 0.Conclusion:I have always been a fan for the FS game art, this game is fun, takes time to master, and takes time to get use to play with a team. This game is old, but it is still fun to play. Special char price NEEDS to change, this is almost doubled price of FSSB2 chars.			"

												English Review:Pros:+ Although the graphics cannot compete with modern soccer games the atmosphere is very convincing+ A neat variety of skills and clothes+ Without tactical approach it is impossible to win+ Unlike most other soccer games this one focuses on slow and patient gameplay+ Well designed and memorable skills+ COOP mode up to 4 players against other players who try to flank you+ Workshop support is in progress+ The part which overwhelmed me most: the SOUND! The game is surrounded by terrifying and pompous sound effects which give you a realistic feeling of being inside a soccer stadiumCons:- A bit clumsy controls (cannot flick flack overduck) but not affecting the gameplay too badly- MISSING PLAYERS! The game is still in Early Access but it does not justify such a tiny playerbase. The game really is worth the money already!			"

												TL;DR - The game could be very good if servers and goalkeeper AI are improved, but the devs seem to be in it for the money rather than enjoyment.Okay, where to begin. I feel as if I'm mostly going to be recapping a lot of the issues already raised, but I feel like the more people speak out about this the more likely the devs are to respond.The base gameplay (not taking into consideraton the connection issues and terrible goalie AI) is actually really enjoyable and the music in the game is really high quality, but the business model and deceptive tactics of the devs is incredibly shady, downright deplorable and ultimately means that I would not recommend this game. As others have stated there is currently an event to commemorate the launch of the game, wherein originally the reward for reaching level 48 was 3000 E-coins (coins which are the event equivalent of the premium currency) which was basically $30 worth of free coins. This could be seen to be overkill, and it seems as if the devs thought this too. DURING THE EVENT, and I'm not making this up, AFTER THE EVENT STARTED they changed the rewards so that now the E-Coin reward is at level 56, and only provides 1000 coins. Not only this but they also changed the rewards so that players now do not get a free DLC character, but rather a ""capsule"" (a gacha/luck system) with a chance to win one of the characters. THIS IS NOT OK. Whoever thought this would be a good idea is seriously misguided, and really makes me question the intentions of the devs. Now some players have received 3000 free coins and a free DLC characters while others are stuck with only 1000 coins (which equates to just over one permanent cosmetic item) if they make it to level 56.To add insult to injury the daily reward system which had previously provided 50 E-Coins for completing 5 games a day has also now been changed to provide only 1000 points. These points are obtained from playing the game, and 1000 points is a very meagre amount. I understand completely that they probably thought 3000 coins on top of the EXP boosts was a bit overkill (which it probably was) but to change the event mid-way through shows that they don't consider the playerbase as much as they do their own profit. If they want to maintain their reputation they should either change back the rewards to how they were and compensate players to make up for what they lost or provide some kind of compensation after the event has ended as an apology (and I don't mean points, which is what I expect they would probably do). Currently all of the permanent cosmetics are locked behind a paywall, something which leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.I will say, however, that I still intend to play simply because of the club community. This is the only reason while I plan on continuing to play; being part of a club is essentially the same as a guild, and I've met a lot of friends on this game in such a short time. Also the league matches that come with being part of a club fix some of the complaints about lack of teamwork.If the Devs rectify their actions (and fix Goalkeeper AI/servers by creating a seperate Brazilian server) I may edit this review to recommend it but as of right now I would say that it's only worth playing for the clubs.

However, they are being fixed at this very moment so fingers crossed...Pros:+Great team game+Lots of new skills and items to develop your players.+Can play competitively without paying.+When it's good, it's very very good.+Teams usually well balancedCons:-servers have been unstable and v laggy recently-a few pay to win players in the game (not many)-controls can be frustrating sometimes-when it's bad, it's really bad...

												This is an awesome football game free to play ever made! There is a ""in game purchases"" but you dont really feel them against you, most of ""Purchases"" are stuff that will level you up faster and to make your own player stylish and look crazy or cool! this game have alot of very friendly poeple, you can join clubs and work it up with ranks! about the freestyle you have skills to play the bills! JK its really cool that the owner of this game added tricks and intersting stuff, i hope there will be more players to play coz the match loading takes pretty long time, from 30 sec, 1 min, and 2 or 3 min! so i hope this game will grow to be better!

												First game I have played and had so much fun. But the key is teamwork. It does NOT really matter too much on avatar skill as much as understanding Futbol (soccer here in the States). I played on a PuG team that went 6 for 2 wins. most losses were in begining. The downside is playing on a team that looks like real life 8 year olds playing.. everyone goes to ball no positions. However, get a team with people that play their roll and you wil have alot of fun.  "

												FreeStyle Football ReviewIn the newest creation by Joycity you get to play a customizable character, who ends up with a brain damage after a tragic head collision. For his cure he has to take medicine frequently and also get his brain scanned by the team doctor, who invites him to his office at the beginning of the game. But as soon as the scan begins you realize that something went terribly wrong, waking up in a completely other football field and the team doctor disappearing. I don't want to reveal more since it would spoiler the main story, so I'm just going for the pro's and con's of the game I've experienced so far.The Pro's+ Joycity has learned from it's previous developed games in terms of graphics, sound and storytelling+ Different pictures, E-Mails, audiologs and letters reveal parts of the story and open questions+ Fully explorable football fields, so taking your time looking for clues of the story will pay off+ A very unsettling and deep atmosphere, supported by the amazing soundtrack + The character you play and those you meet are interesting and also extraordinary+ There aren't as many jumpscares as in Pro Evolution Soccer or Fifa, but that's not a bad point. The maps are bigger and there is more to explore. In addition to that the stressful moments of the game are really well timed and intenseThe Con's- Some textures look stale and should be fixed - Occasional FPS drops ...The VerdictAfter all the game achieved what it intended to become: a thrilling, atmospheric and multiplayer driven Football Game.So if you are interested in any type of sports game you should definitely give this one a shot.

												*FULLSCREEN 1920X1080 CURRENTLY FOR ME DOESN'T WORK AND FLICKERS WHITE CONSTANTLY VERY QUICKLY, WINDOWED HOWEVER WORKS FINE*My Initial impressions of this game were bad, fullscreen didn't work, when the tutorial initially loaded the camera was ♥♥♥♥ed and then one of the tutorial parts made no sense and I have no idea how I completed it. However, after persevering through this I have come to LOVE this game. I have only just stopped playing the game after initially starting (6 Hours Later)-Gameplay-The game is very fast paced and depending on what role you play in the game will also mean if you need fast reflexes or not, as a defender you will be tasked with defending the goal and stopping anyone from getting through and scoring, midfield you are a playmaker and will either setup the attacker(s) or attack yourself, and a striker you will be mostly just scoring.The game has many different skills which you can learn and use as you level up which you buy/unlock via points that are earned in game, you can also use training to boost your stats.There are clubs in the game which is very awesome to see and it works really well!-Microtransactions-There are Microtransactions however they do not impact the game heavily, you are able to buy items but you can buy items without paying real money anyhow with in game currency though even with additional boosts to your character it doesn't boost them too much so it only gives you a slight edge anyhow so you'll still need a good team to win matches!-Bugs/Issues-Apart from the resolution bug I don't believe I have found any other bugs in the game.-Connection-I have only seen a few instances in my 6 hours of playing where the game has had a little sync issue which resulted in a player teleporting but this literally only happened a few times and didn't effect the game anyway.-Conclusion-While initial impression may be a put off the game is a very fun game which I love, I haven't had this much fun playing a game since I first started Rocket League! It's very well balanced even with the microtransactions in place. I give it a 9/10			"

Pros:-Many unique skills to confuse you opponent with-Very addicting gameplay-good music -Not laggy at all-theres a elo system, so you can face against people will similar skills -skills is needed to winCons:-it is a little pay to win but the characters are VERY expensive and is rarely seen in the game -since it is just released, not much people are playing this game. Queues will at least take 1 minute long-controls with keyboard is a little weird but it's still playablrOverall:8.5/10It is a really addicting game I think you should give it a try.

												Very fun and addictive game! 4 players with a bot goalkeeper, you play against each other with no rules, only offside. I don't like the connection, it's unstable and even if I have 47 ping sometimes I can't pass the ball or tackle when it's green. Another thing I don't like is the item limitation, it has a time limitation, with a upgrade to permanet if you buy with real money, there's almost no items you can buy with game points. Anyway, it's a good game to pass the time and for football lovers. It reminds me of Fifa Street and I liked that game on the PS2. It's free to play, why don't you try it for yourself?

												Good Game for soccer fans to partake on,Free Game,Fast Game play.Frequent and many events that gives items or perks to levelup.Alot of Hype when your team gains victory with good teamworK.Can be really fun and challenging, BUTVexing and totally ruined by having team mates who MIA, lags due to poor internet or plays solo/ dribbling football ignorant to the other supporting mates.No way to avoid these from happening, ONE out of Three games, you will encounter the above.Waiting time for match fixing last from less than a minute to a couple usuallyBut at times, it can REALLY takes a LONG time for a proper matchmake.Could take really long time and dollars playing the game to complete majority of the various class achievements.Gradually as you progress thru the game, you would be forced to consider options to purchase for item stats, else it would be a hard fought fight in most matchfixes since the higher the level, the harder and well-spent opponents and strong clans,unless you are lucky to encounter team mates who can think alike and play unselfish gameplay,you will struggle with three quarter of the matches.Pricing for the mini-transactions are way expensive, too many options to pay for in items, opening skill slots and cosmetic glory,which ONLY bind to Each CharacterIf not considering in long term stay at the game, just have a few fun games, P2P is inevitable in the long run. Does Recommend to try it out the Free portion.			"

												Pretty good game, but a bit too many in game purchases. Joycity fixed many of the problems that I wish they had fixed in freestyle2 street basketball, such as poor client, friends list mayhem, and lag/central servers for the most part, and have really polished their launcher and have cut down on bloat. The game runs much more smoothly than it's predecessor. The training system seems kind of odd, and currency is a bit hard to come by after spending all of it on training points. It is regrettable that without an attribute system, my character cannot specialize in ""run speed,"" but this new system alleviates the pay to win aspect of freestyle 2 street basketball. Only issue I have is that all cosmetic items seem to be 12 day temporary, even upon spending real money. They will likely change this in the future. Special Characters seem to be easier to come by, but this may be because of the early launch of this game.			"

												Fun in the start, boring after some few hours. I still prefeer to play Freestyle2: Street Basketball.When i was ""still"" playing the matches most of the times were laggy (not just me, everyone) and the server often crashed into the ""menu"" (again, not just me, everyone was complaining in the main chat), and im not even going to start in the ""searching for players"".Anyway, Fs2 as alot of mistakes and downsides, but after 800 hours is still funny as ♥♥♥♥ to play. I got bored of Fs after 60 hours, and its not because of the ""sport"", its just the game itself.Maybe after some months or years i will return to this game to see if something has changed (besides, Fs uses the same graphism and etc of the first Freestyle Street Basketball game, which came along time ago, at least, it should use the same as Fs2).For those who still play, good luck.

												Freestyle football is good, simple fun that captures the feel of a game of soccer.  Despite several very obvious failings, it's fairly easy to recommend thanks to the combination of the free pricetag and a not especially crowded field of similar games to compete with on Steam.  The main failings of the game are controls and matchmaking.  On the control front, the characters don't move that well on the field and the controls in general feel kind of clunky and awkward.  Character movement isn't responsive.  This sort of game begs for a gamepad, but gamepad support is poor because you're locked to moving in cardinal directions and diagonals and because skills that require pressing multiple buttons don't work unless you bind your gamepad buttons to their matching keyboard buttons using a third-party app.  Additionally, the tutorial and practice mode do a poor job of teaching you and letting you practice the controls.  Matchmaking wise, wait times can be long on the order of several minutes to find a game.  I typically ALT-TAB away and browse the web while listening for the game starting while searching.  Occasionally when I'm already in a lobby with a team or partial team, it seems to break and won't find a game after I've waited thrice as long as I would normally expect to find a game or longer, provoking me to quit and start a new search.  Also as a negative, but one that is to be expected from all but best F2P games, it is an F2P game where you can buy mechanical advantages for yourself.  With your free currency you can buy small, time-limited stat boosts, a chance at tiny permanent stat boosts via ""training"" that are priced to be a near-bottomless hole for points at the rate you earn them once you get to level 20, and a variety of skills to help you manuever the ball on the field better.  When you reach level 40, the game pulls it's meanest trick of promoting you to an advanced class with a whole bunch of new skills that cost much more than the default skills.  You can equip a lot of them- 5 by default and more if you buy extra skill slots- and playing for free I wouldn't be surprised if it took you more than 30 hours of play per skill unlock to earn.As far as the paid currency, for non-cosmetics you mostly get access to more of the same, although for $3 for 12 days you can get a double-effectiveness stat boosting clothing item and for $39 you can permanently unlock a new character (with a unique model) that has some small stat boosts built into it as well.  The one paid currency item of note is extra skill slots beyond the 5 you start with, which is something you'll want eventually and costs $6 per slot and can be bought up to nine times.  This is not great, but I recognize that F2P games need to make their monies somehow and this is one of the less obnoxious P2W implementations I have encountered.  It's relatively straightforward, doesn't pull some of the nastier tricks like tempting you to spend real currency in-game or holding loot hostage, and the stat increases don't have much of an obvious effect on gameplay.  Still, it is what it is so be aware that it is a factor.  For all that I have dedicated the most of the text of this review to negatives, however, I would still recommend Freestyle Football.  It's free.  It's easy to get in to.  It's fun and addictive.  Playing it feels like you're playing a small-team game of soccer or basketball, with a focus on postioning and coverage.  There's not a ton else like it on Steam, so it both feels fresh to me and doesn't have a lot of competitors.  If the idea of playing some internet sportsball has any appeal to you, I'd recommend at least giving Freestyle Football a chance.  Even an hour of play should give you an idea if you like it or not, and if you don't you're not out any money.			"

												In all good conscience I cannot give this game a thumbs up. Almost 200 hours of playtime and I haven't seen enough when it comes to updates and new content as I would like. Joycity, the developers, have a pretty lackluster attitude when it comes to responding to their community and it shows in their games' declining player-bases. I have sent in tickets to their support team only to be given a response that seemed as though they could care less about what I had to say. Their rankings follow an ELO system which doesn't support their matchmaking very well at all. At over 1k ELO you'll still be paired with many people who are just starting to play their first few matches and even if you happen to win you'll only gain about 4 ELO, but if you lose it's about 20.

												For a start: the game is pretty fun. It's fun to play and if you have people to play it with, even better.But then comes everything else, the negatives.- Must stuff on the shop is behind a paywall. And it's not a low paywall, it's on the same level as some mobile games.- To follow on prior point, the stuff you can buy with $$$ nets you in game stats. If you're facing someone with a paid character and paid clothes it can become a problem, but I think it was more notorious on Freestyle Basketball.- They changed the rewards of the leveling up event from a guaranteed payed character, to a slot machine between the payed characters and points.- The servers are miserable. Which is reasonable, since the game is """"new"""", but are long due to a fix.- I saved the ""best"" for last, which envolves two in game mechanics: first, goalkeepers. The goalkeepers AI is ABSOLUTE THRASH. I can't even describe, you just have to play 5-10 games to see for yourself how terrible it is. Goalkeepers defending balls onto the goal, 90% of the shots close to the ground go in under the keeper, the ball is in front of them and they stay put on the goal and much more. The second one might be due to the terrible condition of the servers, not sure, but sometimes you just can't get the ball. It's like the ball is destined for the player X and unless X goes get it, no one can get it. I've seen people stall entire games with that because no one else can get the ball besides them.Then again, the game is fun to play and even more if you have friends. Maybe if the issues get fixed it might have a future, but I see it getting old pretty quick if they don't fix some core stuff. As of right now, as a standoff game, I don't recommend it. But I have hope that the game will improve.			"

												Overall, game has a lot more minor bad and good things going for it that I never stated, but let's say that it has potential. With some love from developers and some interest from community it could become one of better free to play games on market and for that alone I will give it a positive review.Pros :- Fast paced and captivating gameplay- Developers read discussions on steam and respond to them- Free to play- Not pay to win ( Free and premium equipment differs only in apperance )- Game starts you with enough in game currency to fully outfit your character for 30 days and do some basic skill training- Character creator- You can own 3 different characters- You can create or join clubs- Adequate stylized visuals - Uncapped framerate- Supports keyboard and controller and offers option to fully rebind both of those- You level up quickly- Game regularly gives you free stuff- Good animations ( Not quite as good as FIFA but not as♥♥♥♥♥♥ robot with a broomstick up his♥♥♥♥♥♥levels of PES )- Lightweight and not demanding performance wise - Convincing atmosphere of freestyle football ( Soccer if you live in third world country with no free health care, gun ho, mad cops and weird hatred for anything even slightly socialsitc even though you have no clue about economics )Cons: - Team based, to a point where one bad teammate or simply a one unloved troll will lose you a game- Not much in terms of character development- People with bad ping will teleport on your screen and have advantage over you, even if your ping is ~20ms- No russian servers for russians and their potato fueled internet connections ( there's a lot of russians in this game, ps: we love u guys, plz no nuke )- You rent your items- Buggy and unpolished- Goalkeeper AI is bonkers, sometimes he's god in human form and sometimes he's a stale old potato on wheelchair. You will lose many games because of that, but also win some- Feels like an alpha with little content- Outdated archaic ELO system for matchmaking- Tiny population, specially at higher levels- Barebones character creator ( NO SLIDERS IN 2k17 ! #shamedingdingding )- Unbalanced subclasses - Matchmaking is bad, unfair and takes too long ( 20min wait times at saturday evening just to be put against team with 200 more joined ELO than you )- There are no setpices like Freekicks or penaltys, also there are no fauls- Lots of little things like shots on goal looks to be calculated by a diceroll based on yours character stats, so your personnal skill isn't as important as you might want it to be...

												The game's population is highly Brazilian. Most of the defenders suck, the midfielders are innocuous, and all of the forward refuse to ever pass. The solo experience sucks, in other words. Your shots will sail over the goal even when wide open and with boosted shooting stats.When I started playing this game the ""Level Up"" and ""Attendence"" events both promised free unique characters with boosted stats. However the very next day they replaced them with a chance to get those characters, rather than a guarentee. Upon recieving my two chances I got EXP and Points, both of which are relatively worthless.Since this was an obvious bait and switch opperation I asked JOYCITY support (developers) to kindly give me one of the two characters I was promised no strings attached no hard feelings. Never recieved a reply.The game's free. It's good fun with friends. If you don't believe me try it for yourself. But be warned, the game is a grindfest, pay to win and JOYCITY will do anything to ♥♥♥♥ you over while you're trying to have some fun.			"

												Overall this is a pretty fun game (when it isn't laggy as hell) that has a rather surprising amount of depth to it once you have put in some hours. If you want to have some fun with friends, this is a great game for that. If you want to get serious, make a club and reach the top of the leaderboard, that is possible as well. There is tons of character customization, the community is pretty good (for now), although most would say the language barrier between South and North American players causes a ton of problems, but I will get into that later.Character Customization: At first the game seems pretty simplistic with the 3 positions (Forward, Midfielder, Defender) available to you in the character creation screen, but once you start leveling up you will see that you can mold your character into different types of roles. You can buy many skills (with in-game currency) that will allow you to perform curved shots, give and go passes, different types of skill moves, and even more tactical skills, like the ability for defenders to tell the goalkeeper to stay in the net or to come out. You will also be able to pay for training in different skills (again with in-game currency). It's similar to slotting points into a skill tree in a RPG, you can put points into shooting accuracy, shooting power, dribbling, running, strength, agility, passing, and many more. At level 50 or so, you will be able to choose a more defined position, for example, a forward will be able to choose between becoming a striker and shadow striker, a midfielder can become an attacking midfielder or a central midfielder, a defender can become a centerback or sweeper. After picking one of the subclasses, you will have other skills available that you can buy. Community: As I said earlier, the community for this game is pretty good, for now. There are 3 servers, US Central, West EU, and SEA. Since launch there have been a huge amount of complaints about the servers. People have been getting disconnected from the servers, causing the game to close, people get disconnected from games over and over, which results in a loss and can make your stats look worse than they really are. The US Central server is plagued with having to accomodate both North AND South American players. This obviously causes tons of lag for everyone playing and the language barrier can prevent proper communication and teamwork. I can't really understand what people want from me if they are constantly screaming: ""Boa, mds,♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥!"" and I'm sure some fo them have problems understanding the plethora of english words we throw at them too, haha. As for the other 2 servers, I am less familiar with them because I have never played on them, but I have seen the forums loaded with complaints about people not being able to connect to the West EU server at all. There are other issues that have plagued all of the servers, such as errors that wont allow people to connect to the lobby, barring them from queuing up for games. As of today (March 2nd) it seems a lot of these problems are being or have been fixed, I will try updating the review according to the current state of the game.......if I don't get lazy.Gameplay: The gameplay is fun and has a good amount of depth to it. There aren't really any crazy exploits....yet, and everything is relatively smooth. I must say the tackling feels off to me, I think it could use work. It makes no sense that I and 2 other teammates can all attempt to tackle one person at the same time and he/she just jumps over us. Also it feels like some things are completely manual and other times they feel ""assisted"". For example, sometimes a teamate will send you a pass that you have to run to in order to take control of the ball, rather than a regular pass that goes straight to you. Well the problem with this is that sometimes your character will ""lock on"" to that pass and you simply have to run to it and once you get there, you will control the ball. Other times you will run past or over the ball completely and you might run over the ball again when you try to go after it again.Another weird thing is that sometimes the ball might be in the air and you know it is coming to you, so you immediately press the key to pass. In an ideal situation, your character will attempt the pass when the ball actually gets to you. Other times the character will immediately attempt the action even though the ball isn't there yet. This not only makes you look like and idiot, it also lowers your player's rating during that game (albeit only a little, but add up all the time you screw up because of this and it adds up.). This happens with shooting as well by the way, so if you want to pull of a sweet 1-timer, think again.Controls: Good enough except for them being unresponsive in the examples I provided in the gameplay section. If you are planning to play this with a controller, good luck. I have seen quite a few complaints on the forums about the controller support being a little.....shallow, if you will. One problem is that when you buy skills they require you press a combination of keys sometimes, these are shown to you in a keyboard format, for example, you might have to press Q + E to control a ball without making a first touch. When you are using the controller, you are not told these combinations in the format of the controller, so you must figure them out on your own. You might say ""That's not so bad"", but before this whole situation arises, you will notice that the very basic controls are displayed as keyboard only, so you will have to learn what each button on your controller does what in the game in a practice room I guess. Keep in mind, I am just going off of what people are saying from their experience with controllers in this game, I however, have not tried out a controller with this game (might do it later and update the review.......if I am not feeling lazy.Graphics/Performance: They look cute I guess, if you hate anime-ish looking stuff, you probably aren't reading this anyway.  There has been a little glitch that has these black backgrounds for the characters. The only way to solve this is buy putting your game into windowed mode. Just set the highest resolution for your monitor, and it will basically be the exact same as fullscreen. The performance is fine enough on my crappy 1.7 Ghz I5 (nope, not quadcore, I ♥♥♥♥ing wish), Intel HD4000, 8gb of RAM laptop. If you have anything better than this you should get above 30 fps when playing.Developer: This is my first time playing a game made by this developer, so I can't say a ton from my own experience. There are other reviews covering the whole fiasco with the 3000 E-coin reward event thing. There are quite a few incidents where people bought certain packs and did not recieve them, so they are working with tech support to iron out those issues. Of course there are the server issues that I talked about earlier in the review and many others have pointed them out. Other than that, there isn't much else I can say about the developers/publisher, except that they seem transparent and helpful, but it seems they weren't totally prepared for the launch of the game. Again I will update the review to parallel the current state of the game...if I'm not feeling (you guessed it!) lazy.I think that is all I can say about this game, although I probably forgot about some things, I guess you can ask me about them in the comment section or read another review about it.TLDR: Game is pretty fun when there isn't tons of lag. Servers are in need of and are getting worked on. Community is alright, language barrier is a problem on US Central though. Controls are good for the most part, but can feel unresponsive at times and controller support is a bit shallow. Gameplay is smooth, graphics are cutesy anime-ish stuff, performance isn't a problem. Lots of character customization, both cosmetic and gameplay wise. Devs have been transparent, but seemed 'ill prepared'.			"

												I was a fan of FreeStyle street basketball 10 years ago (even before it became part of GameKiss), it was great and you have to practice hard to be better at the game. But it went downhill eversince. Never really cameback. I played all of their previous game including this. Micro transactions ruined it, plus inability to carry the game if your teammate is screwing things up. Poor balancing in matchups. Became pay-to-win instead of gitgud 2 win. This, football, and the streetbasketball are not good to me. PS. If you still play and love FSSB, go try it.			"

												I dont recommend this game unless you are +- 12years old.- Game is buggy - Defending in this game makes really no sense aswell shooting at the goal- Dribbling is complete non sense just walk around- If your character stays in one place its impossible to tackle himMost thing i hate in this game ! Stuffs that you buy at shop makes you better wich means people who pay for premium stuff have better Skills ( Not Really ) ! Lets say Guys who paid for this game has better character skills so if he just runs a enemy guy with a worse tackle cant even tackle him.      I really dont recommend this game for people who wants some realism and no pay to win			"

												Compare this (22Feb2017) to FS2 and you'd see the difference is night and day. Not gameplay wise, there's obviously differences between football/soccer and basketball. But compare it in a.. lets say technical way.First the cons.A minor con but,the controls are super unresponsive and sluggish.They're terribly unresponsive, there is a reason to this though, the controls need to act late so you have time to do another move, say, a kick feint, you NEED to press Q afterwards otherwise you'd mess it up and accidentally shoot.Grinding for points takes AGES. Having to train your character to keep up with the stats in the higher ELO/Level games is difficult if points are super hard to get, I've gotten to LVL4 Training and I can't upgrade at all now, takes too much time to just get a ""Training Failed"", either increase the chance of training success or just give us more points.The tackles are super wonky and weird.It seems as if it's ALL RNG based, If you aren't a defender, slide tackles are only possible from the side and stand tackles have a huge chance to miss, I'm assuming the character's only SOLID meshes and entities are the legs,torso and head, seeing as theyre the only thing that can trigger a header,tackle,block, but maybe that's way too technical and more realistic than it should be, I say keep it the way it is right now.Pros:The game is not pay2win AT ALL.Literally. There's nothing that gives others an advantage that they can get with real money, the only real thing they can buy with real money are skill slots, but I'll get to that in a second. Gold coins are purely for cosmetics, and E-Coins were the best idea I've seen in a F2P game in a long time, you're heading in the right direction, devs!The skills.The skills actually seem quite fair.I've played in high elo games as a low lvl character with no skills equipped and I saw no advantage to the opponent's use of skills at all, we all played the same and it was completely skill based rather than SPAMMIDY SPAM SPAM like in FS2.No cards to give extra stats.All clothing items regardless of price or premium/not give the same amount of stats.EVERY single clothing item in the game gives +20 in a stat you choose, premium doesn't give more and non premium don't give less, this is absolutely amazing.There's alot of positions to choose from.You get to branch from:FW to CF, SS, ST, WFMF to DMF, CMF, SMF, AMFDF to SW, CB, WB, LIBEROI have to say I've never heard of the Libero position before, but after doing research I found out that it was an ACTUAL position in real life football!The lobby.The lobby is excellent, it's well made and you don't have to be in the main menu to be invited by people, you also don't need to have people added on every character you have, i'll talk about that next.Manager.Having a manager where you can manage all your characters at once and add people and their characters all at once is quite a good thing to have. In FS2 you had to add people on specific characters, now you can add them by their manager name too!Clubs.Clubs are pretty good, as I said, the same club is on all your characters due to managers. And even after 5 days of the game's release, there's already rivals! Keep fighting for the top spot, mates.Music.The music in this game is such a big improvement from FS2 that it's superior with only 5 songs.None of that ""WE BE BALLIIIIIN"" stuff to annoy you to headaches, you've got quality main menu music IIIN ENGLIIISSHHHH and NO ingame-music, which keeps you focused till the end!My favorite song in the game is Break It Down - Galaxy Express!

												Dissapointing game and easily unfair, a few reasons;-In game skills that help you play you have to level up and buy with points you earn, this is a football game having such is stupid and unfair. To add to that you can buy boosts to make it even easier to level and such.-You can get cosmetic items but you have to pay real money for all of them, and they might not even be permenant, seriously......-You have to pick a position on the field and depending on what you pick you will have longer waiting times to get a match.-Oh you can buy characters with better stats......-Character custimization is a joke, unless you pay real money-You can use controller but it constantly shows you keyboard controls aside from the tutorial. -Gameplay itself is rather dodgy, tackling is hit and miss and goal keepers are AIs.Might not seem totally unfair at this moment, well the microtransactions definetely are, but just look at the Freestyle Basketball game they made as well, they will most likely do what they did to that game to this one.

												The game itself was fun and addictive but there are reasons that I would not recommend this game (yet). Servers need serious improvement: you could lose the connections for 5 matches out of 10 you played Tech support team do not answer your email (or maybe takes too much time): I sent an email to support team that I constantly got the error box ""The league is closed"" which forced log-out to my character. When re log-in, the error box kept popping up. It was really annoying. Currently it has already taken half day and I still have not got any reply. In my opinion, it is rude not to let me know if is is fixed or not. Or players have to keep logging in to see it themselves? Cash shop items are expensive. At this stage, the game has too many bugs. If you think you can accept these drawbacks, then the game is enjoyable for you. The game concept is great and promote team-based strategy to excel. Solo-type players alone cannot guaranteee success of a team even if they are very good.I really wish I could recommend this game. But I could not accept the mentioned drawbacks especiallty frequently lost connection problem.Though I would be happy to revise the review if there are improvements because I really like to game concept.

												I really enjoy Freestyle Basketball, and everything I'd seen got me excited for this game, but practically every part of it has dissappointed. Other than the some of the people in the game I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this game, key word there is some, plenty of insufferable ones,These are the gameplay elements that I feel really need to be looked at.Interceptions. It's a pretty fundamental part of the defence, so I wonder why they decided to have intercepts have the possibility of knocking the ball in any direction after you stopped the pass. It's infuriating stopping a pass only for the ball to fly to a guy in prime position to shoot, who you can't stop now because you moved to stop their pass. Tackles also have this possibility so it's not 100% guarenteed to stop the attack but that I can at least understand happening realistically. My player kicking the ball half way across the pitch because they intercepted a slow rolling pass is dumb.Goalkeeper A.I. I've won/lost a handful of games because one keeper preforms better than the other. For something that no one, except defence has control over, and that control is literally just telling him to leave the net or stay on line, it's again infuriating that it can be a key factor of why you lost. As I write this review, I quite literally just lost a game where the enemy team had a 30% pass success rate at the end of the game. They had 2 shots on goal, both directly at the keeper, both going in. Meanwhile our forward had 10 by himself and only managed to score one. We literally played them off the pitch but lost because their A,I, preformed better. The thing is, they can't do anything to fix that. I'd imagine both keepers have the same A.I, so it's literally down the chance, but that shouldn't be a deciding factor in the game. Goalkeepers needs to be a position played by an actual person. You shouldn't lose a game because of something you have little control over.Passing, As a mid-fielder directional passing literally felt almost necessary for me after a certain amount of time. Without it, the game seems to pick the most ridiculous decisions of who you intend to pass the ball to. It's annoying wanting to do throughball to the forward sprinting down the wing, then you kick the ball to the guy directly in front you, heavily marked by 2 people. It's a rare enough occurance, but it's annoying as s**t when it happens. I imagine it's only a possibility to justify the need for the skill to be in the game to honest.Now onto their monetization. Day 1, their method of monetization was quite user friendly you could earn some of the cash-shop items by just playing the game or get discounts for better ones, this was perhaps a bit too user friendly, so I can understand why they wanted to tone it down. But they pretty much removed any user friendly aspect of it. With characters costing $30 and decking your character out in the decent looking equipment costing upto $100 it made their price tag a bit more decent.The game has 3 forms of currency, 1.Points, that are earned by completing matches and are used to buy the average looking equipment that last for 12 or 30 days per purchase depending on the amount spent, used for training stats and purchasing skills. 2.Coins, which require real money to get, are used to buy the better looking equipment, that last either 12 days, 30 days or an unlimited amount of time depending on your purchase. They can also be used to capsules thar contain the gear you can just outright buy, but from experience this gear always lasts 12 days and you might not even get any gear from them.3. E-Coins are their final form of currency and why I would say this game was quite user friendly with it monetization before they changed how they were earned. E-coins work exactly like coins you purchase with real money, but can be earned in-game by doing daily rewards, where you got 50-150 e-coins, which last 1 week before they expire. They could also be earned from the current event running and I would imagine future events.Initially the events rewards were quite good, you could unlock 2 of the cash shop characters along with 4000 e-coins.  Unfortunately, they recently butchered many of the possible rewards from the event, so now it's a small chance for one of the characters and they lowered the amount e-coins you recieve to 1000, which honestly isn't the bad part, 4000 seemed a bit much anyway in my opinion. On top of that, they removed e-coins as a daily reward, so events are currently the only I'm currently level 55, but once I hit 56 and get this last event reward i'll probably be giving this game a long break, and come back to see if they improve anything. Until then I can't really recommend the game. It's fun if you find the right people, but all those negative aspects ruin the game experience for me a bit. I can honestly probably even live with those gameplay issues, but these guys literally♥♥♥♥♥♥on their brand new community within 3 days of releasing the game, so screw em.			"

												The game is fun & well constructed BUT ... There is a HUGE BUT, some mechanics clearly make it unplayable I will list most important three of them:1) Tackling & Lag: if you have over 50 ping to server which 90% of the players do... forget about tackling. You will never be able to steal ball or block passes. Your character will miss 99% of your attempts to steal a ball even if you time it perfectly. Where a guy with 10-30 ping will be stealing & blocking king. basically if you see your ping is over 60 ~ due to the way they made the game, forget about playing. You just cant play.2) Offside mechanic: when ball switches opposition it gives 3-5 seconds of ""no offside"" time. In other words... if you steal ball and your teammate is near goalpost even if he is 100% offside position, you can pass to him and he will score. basically making this a game of ""camping the offside zone for counter attack"". As defender you wont be able to leave your goal post because the fact they can pass to offside zone with no problem.ALSO OPPOSITE applies. You may be at offside zone and sometimes game keeps telling you are at offside zone even 2-3 seconds after you are clearly not in offside zone... preventing you to take passes.3) RNG, Yes it is a stat based game yes it has random number generator to determine if you succeed or fail. Where if you are p2w player, you can have characters which gives you increased stats. Which shortly makes this game pay to RNG to win. Considering you have below 60 ping otherwise none of these works.			"

												For a free game, this title promises some nice graphics and some decent game mechanics.If you can ignore minor bugs and the over all feel of a low budget game, then you'll have a good time.However that's only the case when you just simply want to play soccer games.If you fall in love with the art (like I did), you'll probably be interested in the character creator and in the different ways of customizing your game. At first the game promises a good variety of really stylish clothing and skills to motivate the player to earn ingame money in order to buy an outfit he likes.Too bad you can only buy the few ugliest peaces of clothing with that ingame money.All other items have to be purchased with real money. And the fun doesn't end there.After you bought an overpriced item for 5€ (Like socks... Virtual socks), you see that your item is only available for 12 days. In order to keep your item forever you need to spend around 10€ for just one single peace of clothing.I get it, a man's gotta eat. But I personally prefer spending 20-40€ once for an indie game once and earn my items with efforts instead of spending around 100€ on day one and have everything I'd want only to lose motivation in the game.I enjoyed the gameplay itself, but its quality isn't nearly high enough for the high prices.Imagine having a free version of Super Smash Bros where you can only play as mario and online multiplayer is the only gamemode. You could however buy one character with only one colour for 10€.It's such a minor problem that's ruining the whole game for me.Turn down the prices and you'd have a decent game.Or just release it for a fair price (I'd say 30-35€) and make the content be purchasable with ingame money.If there are some new sets of clothing you think are worth paying for, then just simply make them dlc clothing.Just like Rocket League releases new dlcs for money.I may have talked a lot, so here is my opinion in two sentences:The game is okay, but it has too less to offer unless you spend more than you'd spend for tripple A games like GTAV or whatever. And even then the quality of the game isn't near the standarts of these games.			"

												The game doesn't know what ""an offside"" is. Well, technically it does know what it is, because it signals it on correct players with a related symbol over their head, but when they receive a pass... they can just keep playing like nothing happened (not even talking about remotely ""close situations""). Bad/unresponsive controls, yet the game is still way too easy if you get a team with enough braincells to keep passing and moving to a free field. Randomly didn't add me to the match (no, not my connection's fault like some kid in lobby chat tried to tell me) and apparently we don't have the technology to implement ""reconnect"" feature in 2017, so you automatically receive a penalty for that even when it's clearly a game's glitch.Overally terrible game not worth your time even as f2p title, it's literally better to even just go and play anything on sites like kongregate and I assure you that you'll find much better games in there than this ""great"" creation.

												Awesome F2P Soccer game with focus on team play and positioning, I recommend this game cause despite it's free it is a way of magnitude better than PES and FIFA, the physics are just good , game is balanced and not entirely dependant on  player stats like PES and FIFA, no scripting or momentum, no pay to win mechanics ...FIFA has tons of scripted actions and bounces, Freestyle Football is based on physics, the ball doesn't adapt to where players are which happens in FIFA all the time, no bounces straight to your opponents, no passes sent straight to opponents cause FIFA decides to,  no instant interceptions or tackles, pure physics, a lot of fun and personal skills at play.This game is what AAA soccer games FIFA and PES should be but they will never be simply cause EA SPORTS and Konami value Money more than anything else, so they make games where personal skills don't matter much but they invite you to spend money in the game with nothing in return.Freestyle is simply awesome and what all soccer games should be ! I'm quite sure it will soon be considered an E-Sport.			"

												It's good for a free game. The game is fun, though a little buggy. A few bug fixes here and there and you'd have a really good game. My only real problem is that customisation requires you to empty your wallet. I know they have to make there money somehow but you shouldn't go with the ""Nothing is permenant unless with cash"". Buying position changes and name changes sure that should be real money to stop people constantly changing names but the whole ""Nothing is permenant unless with cash"" thing is what killed Blacklight Retribution or whatever it's called.You should definitely get this game if you want a fun team based game that is great to burn away spare time!

												freeStyle Football is a decent football game, with some customization, special moves etc. Sadly, the community is toxic for most of the part and I have doubts about the functionality of the report system after having played other titles from this company ,in which the community is pretty much the same. People going for forfeit because they are lagging, or because their toaster is not able to run the game decently, bad internet, or quitting for any other random reason does not help to get a better ELO (ELO is supposed to indicate how good you are...). In conclucion, the game gets a thumbs up the community does not.			"

Yes, noobs dont pass, noob Defenders go high on the pitch and drives you crazy at the begining. But when you get more exp, and find a avarage club for yourself fun is unlimited. Music, art and game play is awesome. As i wrote above, only cons. are some rare lag issues coused by players with bad internet connection, and because of defender players are less then others, matchmaking sometimes gives and headache. I think they are going to improve this game and its already the best f2p game i ever played.			"

												I have read some of the top ""reviews"" those people who are claiming Pay to Win haven't actually played or looked at the game in depth. So if you are a ""Power Gamer"" like myself I'll give you the info you want.Currently you can get 3 different characters who you can ""P2W"" (locked height/weight which can matter on gameplay, IE headers, animations etc)  for 24/29/39 USD$. They give 24/29/39 extra stat points. There is 21 Statistical Categories that create your character. You have 5800~ skill points @ level 40 when you can pick your specialty(I can literally confirm this via spreadsheet), So you have on average 275 points per skill, each of the unlocked characters divide that bonus over 4-6 skills, so you can see here you are talking 2% bonus on 5 random stats that are not always in use. My fun Pro/Con list:Pro: Extremely fun to play with friends while winning!.Con: You will want to kill your friends after they panic miss 3 empty nets and you lose 1-0. Pro: Sometimes you completely make magic happen. Con: Sometimes you turn into complete hot garbage and throw away the game.Pro: Sometimes your Goalie completely stops everything.Con: Sometimes he jumps out of the way of the ball.Pro: Pub matches can be awesome and competitive nail biters.Con: Pub matches can be absolute clown shows when you have idiots on your team.Pro: League matches with your club are great.Con: Sometimes you just lose games, and you learn more about yourself.Long story short, right now they have great leveling bonuses for points, they have generous rewards, and all the haters here have no idea what they are really talking about. They think this game is P2W because you can buy items.. you got those items for free. Get in here and play, quit reading.			"

												Awesome F2P Soccer game with focus on team play and positioning, I recommend this game cause despite it's free it is a way of magnitude better than PES and FIFA, the physics are just good , game is balanced and not entirely dependant on  player stats like PES and FIFA, no scripting or momentum, no pay to win mechanics ...FIFA has tons of scripted actions and bounces, Freestyle Football is based on physics, the ball doesn't adapt to where players are which happens in FIFA all the time, no bounces straight to your opponents, no passes sent straight to opponents cause FIFA decides to,  no instant interceptions or tackles, pure physics, a lot of fun and personal skills at play.This game is what AAA soccer games FIFA and PES should be but they will never be simply cause EA SPORTS and Konami value Money more than anything else, so they make games where personal skills don't matter much but they invite you to spend money in the game with nothing in return.Freestyle is simply awesome and what all soccer games should be ! I'm quite sure it will soon be considered an E-Sport.			"

												It's good for a free game. The game is fun, though a little buggy. A few bug fixes here and there and you'd have a really good game. My only real problem is that customisation requires you to empty your wallet. I know they have to make there money somehow but you shouldn't go with the ""Nothing is permenant unless with cash"". Buying position changes and name changes sure that should be real money to stop people constantly changing names but the whole ""Nothing is permenant unless with cash"" thing is what killed Blacklight Retribution or whatever it's called.You should definitely get this game if you want a fun team based game that is great to burn away spare time!

												i didnt spend a coin and having fun... cant understand those who said p2w as i never saw op player. This game is a teamwork game. Yes, noobs dont pass, noob Defenders go high on the pitch and drives you crazy at the begining. But when you get more exp, and find a avarage club for yourself fun is unlimited. Music, art and game play is awesome. As i wrote above, only cons. are some rare lag issues coused by players with bad internet connection, and because of defender players are less then others, matchmaking sometimes gives and headache. I think they are going to improve this game and its already the best f2p game i ever played.			"

Posted: February 28
												Hello, I've been playing this game since 6 years ago. It's one of the best game I've ever played and I have spent thousands of dollers and hours into it. When i moved to Australia 3 years ago i was sad because it was unplayable due to the ping. when i went back to korea the year after for a holiday, it ahd shut down and Freestyle football Z was created so i devoted my time into that. But again, when i came back to AUstralia, it did not work. When this came out on steam i was so excited.However, There needs to be some changes that i would think in helping the game. 1, servers need to be more stable and diverse. Currently there is only 3 servers but i hope you expand it to oceania, etc.2, Matching system needs to be fixed for a more balanced game. Im currently a lv 40 SS and im being matched with lv 9s and 10s.3, The pricing on the items could be reduced. When i played the game in Korea, the prices of clothes (permanent) was really cheap. For example, a top would be 5 dollers where as here, it is 14. 4, More items including characters. I've played this game for a while and i was there to see the end. I have a good understanding of what characters you will bring out but the characters you have now are way too overpriced for the thing you are getting. It only gives you 24 more stats and doesnt have a special skill or more stats. I hope the developers look at this and also if you want tips to this game if you are new, please add me, ControlTower I am willing to help anyone who is interested in learning!			"

												Overall, this game is fun and it will definitely get any football lovers hooked at first and from there on out its whether you decide to keep playing despite many flaws or play, hope for short matchmaking, hope for a nice game, etc.So what makes this game great? Well its pretty much 4v4 fifa for absolutely FREE and for what its worth, its a really nice game. Its fun to play and with the ELO rating it gives us a bigger purpose to keep playing the game: To become number one on the leaderboards. Character customisation is pretty good, which is expected from joycity since their games do have a fair amount of character customisation (fs2 basketball). It's got ""freestyle"" in the name so you can expect to do amazing skills and you have a shop to buy them (in game credits) and equip whichever one you love. The ""skills"" which are just abilities like auto slide tackle are definitely relevant to playing a match as you'll need them to make your player and yourself more experienced and skillful. I don't know what will happen after the launch commemoration event (free stuff for levelling up) but lets wait for that.So the bad details; the cons. It's a game by Joycity. Lets not forget that. Their games are never perfect, and so are their servers. At the moment servers are pretty bad but the game is playable most of the time. There can be frequent disconnections from games for some specific people however im sure a quick restart to the game client wouldn't hurt! Technically, this game is leaning towards the bad side. After playing for a short time, probably one match, you'll easily notice that some of your tackles dont connect, you don't shoot properly, you dont intercept properly, etc. The game isn't that old though, so we can maybe expect many technical updates, although it is Joycity, i don't know how it will work out.THE WORST THING: The controls when configuring gamepad. For me at least, i cannot change controls at all. Whenever i click something to change, it changes to Z-axis which is probably my mouse click. I've tried literally every way to change any controls and that doesn't work. ;(My final rating of this game is a 6 or 7/10 for technicality and 10/10 for enjoyability and replayability. Unless you don't actually like fifa, you can expect to be playing this game alot. MY ADVICE: Do not play this game literally every single moment you're back on the computer. Remember that this is still a game and if you want a game to still be fun to you forever dont play it literally all the time. Trust me, just dont.			"

												I've never review before.. so here it is..Pros:+Good community (In Asia server.)+Good soundtracks.+Barely P2W like the others said. Maybe because they never get Unique characters? Unique characters doesn't give much of an edge to game play. (I got unique Forward character, Rachel for free. I'm using her right now and she's not that OP. Still not recommend you to pay real money to buy Unique characters. Not worth it.)+Team work based. If someone is doing something too much. You might lose the match.Cons:- Goalkeepers is AI.. which I REALLY HOPE they would add a systems. Where players can actually play as goalkeepers.. not stupid AI Goalkeepers..- Abit clunky controls.- Gameplay feels abit weird sometimes. (It maybe I play too much FIFA?)- There's too much players on each server right now. Expect connection lost, Lags etc. (They trying to add more servers now. South America has been added today.)- You have to pay real money to buy MOSTItems. AND IT HAVE LIMITED TIMES FOR EACH ITEMS.- It might be rough for new players to settle in.For me 6/10. This game is ehh okay to good. I like this game and I'm currently addict to it right now.  I hate the part that I have to pay real money to buy.. not some Items. Most of it and it have limited times... But as F2P I think I don't have much problems with it. And if you complaints why people are not passing or bad at this game? Join the clan. You'll get to know an actual good players to top players.			"

												This is a pay-to-win game, make no mistake. The gameplay is fun enough, but finding a match is a pain, and the controls are kinda wonky. There is a slight delay between inputing an action, and your character performing said action. It forces you to try to play ahead of the game, which is difficult. The menus are pretty cluttered as well, with some random card game popping up in my face when I first entered the main menu. The character setup is not completely clear as to how the system works with matchmaking, which can often be pretty bad. To make it slightly worse, there are those that play this game very often, and it shows. They can take advantage of situations that you never knew you were in. The art style is fun and refreshing, but the pay-to-win and wonky controls are not.			"

												The game is in desperate need of a BR server. The entire (and only) US server is constantly flooded with people with extremly low ping, making the game borderline unplayable as a US player.Until the game is patched, this is a pretty big issue, and it's one I can't really overlook.			"

												I'm not sure how I feel about this games choice in game store with its limited use items you can purchase with the in game currency. It kinda bothers me since I'm a casual player and I generally don't come back to the same games for awhile trying to play this would be hard for me since I'm not dedicating large amounts of time to unlocking these outfits over and over that give you more points toward different skills since most of the ones I've seen only give it to you for 12 days I don't expect myself to play this game more than 3 days top and then I'll probably stop for awhile and come back later when I have nothing and have to start from scratch since I can't purchase any of the items permanently with in game currency. So my review will be a no until they update this and make it more viable for me to want to come back. Other than this I think the game has great potential and others might really enjoy playing even if they have to keep the grind going.			"

												For those who played ""Kicks Online"", you will find a very similar game.Very funny and addictive game. It may take some time for you to get used to the gameplay, specially on defending as tackling is a bit hard. The special thing about it is teamwork. As soon as you get the hang of it, and have a few good matches, you won't stop playing. Just give it a try and dont give up on the game after 3 or 4 matches.			"

												After playing for 10+ hours, I do not recommend this game.I do not know for the other servers, but the SE Asia server, it is flooded with Thailand players, making it impossible to communicate in English to enhance teamwork.Gameplay:Pro: Fun before level 40, it seems that most players are willing to pass, and the defenders willing to defend at all cost.Cons: Most players level 40+ seems to not pass the ball anymore. Defenders do not defend anymore, most of them play SW to attack. I rarely see any defenders defend past this level, making gameplay unenjoyable.The verdict: I do not recommend this game for players looking for a soccer game that deeply rely on TEAMWORK.			"

												Ive played thousands of hours of games, this is the only experience that has left me so dissapointed im going to review it. Pure crap, clunky feeling, stat based rolls on tackling, irrelevant positioning, cones which change colour and mean absolutely nothing. Its like someone tried to take a board game, and smash it into a 4v4 football game with bizzare mechanics that make little sense and simply dont work as intended. Why they have tried to incoporate the offside rule on a game with a pitch the size of my living room is beyond me, on top of that it does not even perform as intended, if a player recieves the ball in an offside position then he/she should automatically pass the ball to the opposition. In reality the player often shoots or sets up a team mate automatically. Ignoring the fact the game doesnt seem to actually know when someone is offside, most of the time you can just sit behind defenders with no consequences. Its just a bizzare pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ buy an actual football game, like any other game with a ball will do.			"

												Unfortunately this game has a bad server issue for American players.  Basically 90% of the players on the US servers are South American.  This means that most of the players you're playing with have really bad ping and that makes matchmaking painul, communicating impossible, and playing a proper game very unlikely.Long story short;  They need to open up South American servers, but even when they do most of the players will stay because that's where their main characters are.

												This is a pretty good game when nobody in your game has a bad connection. If a single person has a high ping however, everyone in that match suffers. The single player is also completely inplayable. Of course you can win and it doesn't require much stratagy, the AI goalies will either block everything magically or they're complete garbage and can't block a straight on shot. On top of that, AI teammates in the single player mode are  pretty useless, they contantly make completely illogical passes or shots. When a multiplayer game goes well though, and everyone has a good connection, the game is great. Fix your servers and make the AI a little less useless.			"

												There is almost no skill in this game imo. At most points it seems like rng, and often the goalkeeper's ability to save the simplest of shots is unparalled to the other goalkeeper, and their's simply nothing you can do about it. Intercepting passes even takes rng, and comes down to complate luck. Nothing you can do most of the time. I don't reccomend this game because it most comes to luck, barely ever skill. You'll have more fun with Freestyle 2 Street Basketball, but imo, not this.			"

												FreeStyle Football is a decent football game, with some customization, special moves etc, a lot of outfits for male and female, a costume that looks like you are sitting on a donkey or various wings, helmets etc. you can make your character as you want.  There is a fair amount of toxicity in this game, as you would aspect in a free to play competitive game that has some flaws; server stability, P2P problems (Peer-to-peer not pay to play, just to clarify.) basically the connection is evenly distibuted over the players and if a certain connection is not met, the game crashes or will not start or you will be waiting in a lobby forever, best thing is to have all party members with a good conection, so be sure to check your region before you start on a server before you have to start all over again. Roles, now this is something really crucial in this game, as you can pick your character, you also pick a position on the field. You want to be a defender, you will have stats as a defender, that means that you should be good at intercepting, defend your half before the situation is getting too difficult and aid your GK, block etc. Beeing out of position, or not respecting your role will give you a bad end-result at the end and your party will not be very happy either. There are also more all-round positions, but additional positions options can be unlocked on level 40.  In the category soccer games or football games (There seems to be a difference for some people) this is a very enjoyable game with the right people, or just join a guild with like-minded players who also enjoy the game in a nice 4 vs 4.

												Garbage. Trick hat for more money on the side. Pros: Small download size.Cons:Small game.Full of newbies so the ""somehow-already pros"" are always crying and leaving.Small playerbase.Kicking the ball in the goal is one of the hardest things to do. The goalkeeper never gets to block a goal kick. The ball always flies out of bounds(vouch for me on this).Nobody uses the offensive abilities because they are so minor and extremely pointless. You can't play soccer before playing this game, otherwise you will most likely rage and uninstall(unless you have no money for FIFA).Did I mention this game is garbage?Servers suck.You get kicked from the game for lagging. Never returned to menu.Characters look like silly putty from hell with lighting.When a game starts, the characters look back and break the fourth wall by giving you a gesture. This is more creepy than a Kinect watching me give my Xbox a blow job(to get the dust out, you dirty thinkers).The AI can be pretty stupid.You can't block a goalkeeper's pass to the opposition if he rolls it. Literally just goes past your legs like butter. You can't play goalkeeper.You can't play most of the time because quitters in lobbies and games are usually met with that ONE pro player who keeps scoring. You have to be devoted to learn what a mechanic is in this game. Freestyle2 Basketball is better. Albeit garbage, FS2 garbage smells better. Easy to ragequit though.No point in buying new characters as they are just pretty faces. One of them doesn't even have an animoo-style picture... Just silly putty as if it was a toy you could play as. You can be an idiot and still win.Oh, and don't let your friends know you play this game. You will lose your friends if they attempt this garbage.  "

												I have no idea how I feel about this game,I can love it one game to hating it the next and let me explain why:-Tackling is broken 90% of the time(Standing tackle is useless basically and slide tackle you have to be SOOOO precise with it and in that you can go through the opponents legs and still not get the ball but if you go too far ahead you seem to get them ... makes so damn sence)-Matchmaking is so damn broken as you can get players that are top notch and people who are new to the game .... this result in games being so randomly generated its poor to know if you team is any good or not-What is with the clothing(Not an issue just something I dont truely agree on) You can buy clothes but they are not perma clothes .. they last either 12 days or a month for double the price .... and thats just for one shade of colour not even the whole thing .... plus the abilities hardly change the play and for something im paying for not to keep is pretty trash I think-Rare Capsules are pointless .... the chance to actually get anything solid is hard but the lower tier items are okay but are they worth the wait ... no because you can get something better from it the day before .... and some items you get you can pay with the points currency... so why are they rare???????-Now the game is broken and I cant even get into a game as a pop up happenes so much that I cant even view my character or get into a game without it saying 'League is over' which really annoys me!-Sound is annoying ... change change how loud it says ''GOAL'' and that is way too loud ... unless I mute it but then the game just feels weird to play-Not enough different types of players ... everyone plays striker or midfield and not enough defender ... I understand no one wants to play the role but without it you cannot play as midfielder unless you are lucky to find the rare ones-Bugs of black boxes everywhere and some things I can never see .... not just me so I know its not a graffix problem and my friend sees black boxes too so plz fix .... However despite all of this the game before this prior update was still very fun and worth it for a free game. me and a friend team up him as attacker me and defence and it works out pretty well and I have not had a day where the game has been bad... beside today...What truely needs fixing ... how the game goes... tackling ... and the characters need to be more diverce ... every game pretty much has the same thing Plz fix ... 9/10 would play if again if fix			"

												In the beginning I immediately hooked on this game, because the concept is good, a team game, nice graphics making a bit of thinking about mangas, a gameplay without too much unbalance between the different players, but I Quickly understood that this game was not for me, with a ping of 20 impossible to do a game without lag, actually at first I thought it was a connection problem but in fact it is the servers of the game Which are overloaded and are not suitable.Not to mention the many bugsThe community is also really bad, insults in the main chat all the time, people who think it's a solo game while it's a team game, do not pass the defenders who go Take on for attackers and lose their team, when they have the misfortune to reproach them or give advice, they are insulted and in the worst case they stop playing voluntarily to lose the team.I counted in 1 month I was wished to have the cancer 4 x to situate you the kind of person who play in this game.Attackers and midfielders who never defend and who blame the defender when they take on a goal when it was 1 vs 3Trolls that enter the games just to not play and lose their team, Afk people in full part who do not play.People who cheat to win, use software or macros to automatically tackleThe game does not even have a system of recording of the parts, so it is necessary to record each parts oneself and send them to the support to postpone the cheaters and in any case the cheat is undetectable so the cheaters will never be banishedNo function to block users ...A free game, but if you want to become good you have to pay and the price is way too high $ 50 for 5000 e-coins and with that you get nothing at all, you might need $ 500 to get all Parts and features.A team of developers / moderators who do nothing to improve things, I was expecting a lot from the latest update, but nothing has changed.There are still a lot of negatives, I'm not exhaustive because I think I've already lost enough time with this game, I was a finger of breaking my pc so this game is frustrating.This is just a little glimpse of this game that has enormous potential but is spoiled by Its community and the lack of professionalism of the developers.

												Community so toxic, racist and down right vile. Play as a newbie only if you're ready to be screamed at for not playing the 'perfect way'. Not to mention the dodgy keyboard controls with only 5 directional way movement (in 2017?!) obnoxious soundtrack and voice acting you wouldn't ever want to be credited for. Also special mentions to whoever designed the tutorial not to mention ANYTHING past how to play the game (I nearly got lost in the menu screen)There are better free to play games out there. and there are better free to play football games out there. I'd say even the FIFA community is more welcoming and that's saying a lot. It could be a good game, but not in this state.			"

												First it was really fun until i start to get so many loses.When you start to get 2-3 loses in a row, matchmaking system will get you low elo players and high elo players to the other side which will cause you to lose more matches which is stupid af. For 3 days, i have won only 1 match because of this matchmaking system.Also games are laggy sometimes, servers need to be checked.			"

												Im saying this from years experience of Fifa and also quite alot of hours on this game on my main steam account which i've stopped using for a while.Pros:-Pretty much 1% of players that play this have actually played a football game before such as fifa, so most players are horrendous which makes it an interesting experience when both teams suck.-Great with a team that coordinates well.-Controller support which actually makes the game playable.Cons:-Controls are super rough.-Matchmaking for anything that isnt defender is forever.-Most strikers are useless which makes the game less fun when you have to do all the work.-Micro transactions (I get that the game is free but any game that has them is just terrible)-Latency problems. Mostly due to the fact that you can tackle a player that would 99/100 times hit the ball, but it doesn't, it makes being a defender almost impossible and ruins the entire experience for me personally since i only play Def and i get screamed at by my team cus the other team has horrendous connection.-No in game menu for either leaving or sound options.-Announcer volume when goals are scored doesnt go down when all sound options are practically at 1%.-Elo ranking system is useless. My teams ELO was 700 one time and we got paired against a team with 900.-Get penalized for getting disconnected from games. Even game crashes which happens quite often. Quick tip: Never click on loading screens. It isnt a big decrease in points & exp but its still the dumbest thing ever,-Needs better controller support. Its only used in game and even then theres still some stuff that you cant do. -Profanity Filters. You can't have the most british sport in a game and take away one of the best british things about it. Even then, you cant say ""Offside"" without it starring letters out.-Missing some rules and core aspects of football. Offside doesnt work properly,ball can go out of the pitch and sill be in play (Somehow).-Goalkeepers are biased. 8 times out of 10 the enemy team has a goalkeeper that can save godly shots and even shots that RL goalies cant save. Then my teams goalie lets the ball hit him in the face and then watch it roll into the net.Regardless that theres not much good about this game, i'd still recommend it cus its the best thing to get if you cannot afford a decent football game.

Team work is definitely key in this game.AT and MF are easy positions but DF is quite hard as there is a serious lack of teamwork and you get isolated pretty quickly.Matchmaking is poop, but what does one expect from a free game?Only going to play it when I can't be bothered playing with myself.

												Super enjoyable when you get a good team!Sometimes the waiting time to get a match can be a bit prolonged, but the player base has a decent ammount of players to support great gameplay.This game is super fun, the only aspect it lacks is spectating games and the occasional player lag that can make the player ""teleport"" without you being able to take the ball from him.Other than that, this game is a super fun teamwork-based football game with lots of skills to learn and positions to master.10/10 would play again			"

												This game warrants a cautious recommendation from me.Even though the game was (re?)released not that long ago, there didn't seem to be that many people actively playing it when I stopped logging in a couple days ago.I exclusively played the DF class on two toons over lv50 and my ELO was typically 1200+ yet matchmaking would always put me in teams with much lower (we're talking low 20's to mid 30's) leveled players.Granted, playing with friends or clubmates technically solves the issue, but matchmaking would then take a very long time.And as many people mentioned, GK skill levels are completely arbitrary. I've had matches where skilled FW players would struggle to get a goal in, where other times I could shoot from a little after the midfield and score.YMMV. You should at least give it a try though. It can be fun.			"

												This game is pretty awesome. Personally I don't even like the cartoony graphics but who cares when the gameplay is so fun.However, the matches are laggy even though my ping is 30. It's worth the free price anyway but it makes the game a lot less enjoyable than it could be.Only gameplay problem: Clear offsides are sometimes not counted at all and when they are, the offending players are just forced to pass the ball backwards (often back to their own players). So the penalty for offside is too minor in this game. I'd suggest that they were forced to pass the ball without a chance of failure to the opposition 100% of the time in this case.			"

												The game is actually really fun, it needs a bit of work on the programming and there really isn't enough people playing to have that kind of level range requirement for skill moves. Deffinitely needs a tweak. Also, the audio is very disturbingly loud. Even in you turn it down, the in game sound is very loud and almost repulsive is the voice actors, obviously they weren't integrated very well. The characters also need more customization. Although by what I can tell from the 2010 publish mark is that the game was ported from a foriegn country other than the US (my native nation) and is actually an old port. However, the game I believe is fantastic. It's very fun and I really hope to see some more people playing soon.			"

												Let's start from the point you launch this game.The servers are laggy no matter how good ping you have and also i've seen people get crashes at start.The matchmaking is awful and if you don't play with premades you'll loose no matter how good you are.The game is slighty p2w. By that i mean clothes you buy with real money give you bonus stats and stuff and characters that you buy are overpriced around 20$ each.The controls are pretty clunky and combined with awful servers it's like going all over the place.And when you get kicked by the horrible servers from the game or ever better loose connection you get a penalty and they take points and exp from you.Overall score 4.2/10Not worth playing and it's far from enjoyable.

												This game has SOOO MUCH POTENTIAL....That said, this game has the WORST matchmaking I've had to deal with in a ""bigger"" game. To be fair a large part of this is because we were screaming for a S. American server cause most ppl are from Peru or Brasil and didnt speak english (not a big part of this game, hence F1-F5) and we got one. Being as most people that play this awesome Futbol game are S. American we (US servers) got d*cked. This isn't really the Devs fault, they were just trying to make it better, but somehow it made it worse. The other reason why I am NOT recommending this game is because almost 30% of the time I ""lag out"" of matches, meaning I'm lagging so bad that if I don't quit or press F9 to switch to AI then my guy will basically just stand there or run a lil do nothing. THIS HAPPENS WAAAAAAY TOO MUCH FOR A SPORTS GAME NO LESS FOR A MULTIPLAYER ONE!! For reference I do not lag on games twice as graphic intensive as this one on Steam.OVERALL I'd say this game is pretty well put together, it is def a PAY TO WIN at the higher levels but you can still have fun not paying, new classes and what not to try out. BUT even when u lose your stuff after 12-30 days cause I guess clothes just fall apart by then xD Play but expect horrible matchmaking at later levels (700 ELO vs. 1k+ elo) and LONG a** wait times (NA servers), OH and you may just lag for a whole game or 3 for the 1000th time and write a review.

												Overall: 6.5/10There's not another game like it on Steam where you can control your own player like this...so that counts for something.  I was hoping for a more realistic simulation of the beautiful game.  The latency, unrealistic skills and cartoony nature can be a bit numbing if you're looking for a more real experience.  The lack of consistent offsides calls being made is a turn-off.  I wish skill moves could be made with the combination of a top button and moves with my right joystick.  Also not a huge fan of skills having to be unlocked via purchase, it would make sense if you could do a skill once the right attribute points were reached.  I would like it to be similar to a PES-style arena football team-up.      There is some fun to be had.  It depends on what you want out of the game.  I really wanted a true to life experience. Pros:         - simulation of football teamplay         - short matches          - some fun to be hadCons:          - not real to life          - latency issues           - Offsides not being calledVerdict:  It's worth a try if you want a football teamplay simulation, there's not many games like it on Steam.

												Freestyle Street Football is a team-based sports game that was produced by Gamekiss, the same studio behind Freestyle Street Basketball 1 and 2, in which you compete against other as a midfielder, a forward, or a defender with different sub classes as you get into higher levels.PROS:+ Free to play + The matches are fun and usually fast-paced+ Very beginner-friendly. + Rewards for leveling and logging in + A soccer game. There aren't many out there and there aren't any free to play soccer games, Fifa world was a good one.+ Multiple servers depending on where you are from. Everything isn't forced onto one server+ Customization CONS: - The community can be kind of toxic at times- Matches can be hard to find depending on what position you select.- There are a bunch of brazilians on the North American server. Another server is need for these players. They are only playing with same language speakers. - The game crashes from time to time, especially if the f9 hotkey is pressed. P.S. I use f9 to record. - There aren't a lot of players.- There can be a learning curve for players who do not understand soccer/futbol. - There are people who like to shoot and not pass.Overall, this is an awesome game that I hope more people find out about. This game shut down prematurely because it was in the shadow of Freestyle Street Basketball. Hopefully, Steam helps the growth of the game because there aren't any enjoyable free to play soccer games. Fifa and Pes are best bets for soccer games. This is solid and super enjoyable. This is a good play for people who want to have some fun It's too brilliant not to play.My rating: 8.0P.S. My YouTube Channel : Zapsy.

												This is a really fun game that can get you hooked if you're a football/soccer fan. I believe I saw Freestyle Football years ago but I never tried it at the time because I didn't have a pc suitable for gaming. Now, I finally do so I downloaded it as soon as I saw it. I played for hours straight! At first, you don't have flashy moves when you're trying to get through opponents but that builds up through progression. As you level up, you gain access to skills that you can purchase and add on to your character. However, there is a limit to how many skills you can add and the only way to unlock skill slots is through real money. This isn't bad because you can still be a good player if you manage your skills well. Unfortunately, there are items in-game that you can buy with real money and improve your character, but don't let that deter you from playing this game because it's quite easy to buy the items by just playing normally. There's no advantage between in-game currency items vs real money items, except for the permaneent duration option. Yes that's right, with in-game currency you can only own an item for a max period of 30days, but you can choose to buy an item with real money and keep it forever.I know the game just recently came out again and it's not like the developer is a giant, so I was not expecting a clean game. There are bugs, unpolished music and server issues but I have big hopes for the game. I hope the developers work out the issues since I really found the game to be a blast. It's an excellent free to play game for any football/soccer fans out there!			"

												This game is so generous giving rewards...  I was gifted a lot of experience that I'm lvl 31 and I played only for an hour. I'll keep playing it because I had a nice experience with some players.•The game is fun even if you're not a fan of football games.•The controls are acceptable for being a football game.•It's competitive and you can make a football club with some friends and grow like a team.•It's free-non android port game that you'll enjoy. (Good 2 know)•The waiting time it's not soo long.•The player customization it's okay: Like many games you should ""pay 2 look cooler than the others"" but meh, the game gives you rewards and you can have free clothes too at start.

												Well i havn played this game for a bit of time now and while mechanically it doesn't compare to a game like Football superstars I personally do find it fun.  Pros - Easy to pick up + If you like light hearted games its great + Outside football superstars their isn't really anything Like it on the free to play market. Its fun Cons -Graphics and connection stablity arn't the greatest but its early.Some aspects of the game lack good communication - such as early rewards crossing between characthers. Only one real game mode [ 4vs4] would be nice to see larger games.    Tackling is more of a minigame than physics based. -----If football superstars had the same playerbase i wouldn't recommend this game but alas it doesn't			"

												Fun game. Hadn't played a football game in years because I got bored of them, but I'm having a blast with this one!+Controller support works fine, better than recent AAA games I've played.+Easy to learn basic controls/ game features.+No connection problems from my end in EU server (10-30ms), although I've seen people with bad connections dropping out of matchmaking lobbies.+The best ballance system I've seen in F2p games so far. (For beginners atleast. Haven't experienced more advanced ratings)-Could use some more customization items and permanent purchase for Point items.-Only has 2 genders: Male and Female. Where are the other 153? (I kid of course)-Could have some more ways of getting E-coins than dailies, like through quests or achievements.Overall, I rate FreeStyle Football ͏7.8/10.͏͏			"

												This game is free? I would have paid to play this game thats how good it is. The single only complaint i have is lag. Servers are so laggy some times and players from other countries are on the wrong server so you literally cannot stop them becuase nothing you do registers (similar to H1Z1 if you've ever played it). Still it doesnt take away from this games fun. There is a training system where you can upgrade your character's stats permantly and equipment that gives stats temporarily. Solo mode for players who just like bots, only played a few games of it and it was too easy for me after coming from multiplayer but still was good. Playing with friends is awesome, and if your competitive you can make a club and join a league to compete. Controls are pretty good once you get a grasp of them, feels a little unresponsive at times but its not too bad. Just fix the lag and the players joining wrong servers to gain advantages and this game is one of the best free to plays on steam.			"

Now I have to judge it as a free game and for that reason you must get this game. Does it have problems, yes. Serious one when it comes with the servers. Either way when you get going is hard not to come for a match or two, or the 5 it ask of you daily. Get it you'll like it.			"

												Really fun game to play with friends.I am a US based player in the top 200 and yes occasionally (1 out or 8-10 games) you will have a laggy SOB in the game that will cause a problem, or kick to lobby if its before the start. I've never seen someone lagging the game make it through the game all the way, they just get dropped and turn into an AI player.Anyone who calls this Pay to Win has some serious issues, you can get the exact same items with the exact same stats for free. Yes you have to PLAY the game to get them, but its not even alot. IE: It takes 8000 Points to get a 30 day Shirt, on which you pick which stat to improve (Same 20+ Points as a Pay Player)  Depending on how much you play 8000 points isn't a whole lot for a month of stat boost in a F2P game. If you play 1 hour a night or something, you may find it difficult yes. But you weren't that invested anyway, right?Solo play can be rough, but... if you are playing a video game on the internet, surely you are not surprised that every selfish little kiddie wants to be the star of the game. The tutorial being updated with some additional advanced commands for shooting/dribbling/defense might help some players. It is not very indepth. Most of the people who complain about defense not working just dive at everything or try to steal every ball. The same people who just slap everybody in NBA games trying to steal, and give away easy buckets. Stay in front of your defender, wait for the right opportunity... y'know.... like real defense.TL:DR Best played with friends, or be social and find yourself a nice club (I've met quite a few good un-selfish players)           Certainly not pay to win, people on the internet just repeat phrases they hear other people say.8/10			"

												It's a better version of Football Superstars but it's very American... it's SOCCER not football is what the developers must be thinking in my opinion.Football Freestyle is decent enough for a free2play and no pay2win either, all the microtransaction are cosmetic addons you cannot buy better skills or gain an advantage. Do not expect anything near Fifa or Pro Evo and you'll have a good time this is something you can pickup and get into a match quickly every now and then to kill 30 minutes to an hour.If you want a simple version of the famous BE A PRO mode then try this, it's more MMO style play and cartoonish though it hasn't got the engine or advantages of Fifa or Pro Evo. Don't expect anyone to pass or play with any skill until you get to a better skill cap, then tactics, passing, interceptions and character skills are worth while and the games become less one sided. This game has a lot of room for improvement but is a solid base and most football fans will like it.Easier to play with friends and a gamepad! I've gotten a few hours of fun out of it and I'm sure I'll fire it up every now and then.			"

												Pros:-Fun, quick matches-Simple controls, but still requires skill and teamworkCons: -Server gets laggy sometimes-Toxic community-Buggy ball catching and stealing sometimes-Match-making takes a long time in US server after SA got their own serverPretty fun game. Reminds me of Kicks Online, but the server lag can be annoying sometimes. Very addictive game. I just want to keep playing game after game. The match-making is starting to take a long time though and it's a bit annoying. Unfortunately, I predict the playerbase will fall hard after a few months (typical for games like these..).			"

												It is a very good concept and is very well executed , I wish that there is  a west America server and pls make it so that points can buy items permanently because I hate having to pay for items every 13 or 30 days its annoying, it would be okay if you raise their price or add items that are permanent but have no effects. Thank you			"

												Really fun game to play with friends.I am a US based player in the top 200 and yes occasionally (1 out or 8-10 games) you will have a laggy SOB in the game that will cause a problem, or kick to lobby if its before the start. I've never seen someone lagging the game make it through the game all the way, they just get dropped and turn into an AI player.Anyone who calls this Pay to Win has some serious issues, you can get the exact same items with the exact same stats for free. Yes you have to PLAY the game to get them, but its not even alot. IE: It takes 8000 Points to get a 30 day Shirt, on which you pick which stat to improve (Same 20+ Points as a Pay Player)  Depending on how much you play 8000 points isn't a whole lot for a month of stat boost in a F2P game. If you play 1 hour a night or something, you may find it difficult yes. But you weren't that invested anyway, right?Solo play can be rough, but... if you are playing a video game on the internet, surely you are not surprised that every selfish little kiddie wants to be the star of the game. The tutorial being updated with some additional advanced commands for shooting/dribbling/defense might help some players. It is not very indepth. Most of the people who complain about defense not working just dive at everything or try to steal every ball. The same people who just slap everybody in NBA games trying to steal, and give away easy buckets. Stay in front of your defender, wait for the right opportunity... y'know.... like real defense.TL:DR Best played with friends, or be social and find yourself a nice club (I've met quite a few good un-selfish players)           Certainly not pay to win, people on the internet just repeat phrases they hear other people say.8/10			"

												It's a better version of Football Superstars but it's very American... it's SOCCER not football is what the developers must be thinking in my opinion.Football Freestyle is decent enough for a free2play and no pay2win either, all the microtransaction are cosmetic addons you cannot buy better skills or gain an advantage. Do not expect anything near Fifa or Pro Evo and you'll have a good time this is something you can pickup and get into a match quickly every now and then to kill 30 minutes to an hour.If you want a simple version of the famous BE A PRO mode then try this, it's more MMO style play and cartoonish though it hasn't got the engine or advantages of Fifa or Pro Evo. Don't expect anyone to pass or play with any skill until you get to a better skill cap, then tactics, passing, interceptions and character skills are worth while and the games become less one sided. This game has a lot of room for improvement but is a solid base and most football fans will like it.Easier to play with friends and a gamepad! I've gotten a few hours of fun out of it and I'm sure I'll fire it up every now and then.			"

												I will give thumbs up when these issues will be adressed : - Repeated game crashes because of the anti cheat that detects hacking when i'm not using any hacks, or any other software like OBS or chrome. These caused me to lose Elo, XP and in game points.ready button : I would love to have a ready button that I need to press before going into a match with random team mates. This will prevent playing with players who you already played with and didnt apreciate playing with, or didn't match your teamplay, or weird matchmaking teams ( 3 forwards, and me midfielder in defense position ) Apart from that, it is a fun game with great teamwork aspect. I hope more and more people join so we can have more fun.I would like to add however, that there are some things that could be added to the game and make the overall experience better.for example : ready button : I would love to have a ready button that I need to press before going into a match with random team mates. ( Sometimes, I play with a player that is not willing to communicate, so when I see that I am matched with him again, I don't press the ready button and I can leave ). Also, the ability to access the game settings during a match would be great ( to adjust sound settings for example )Pressing H removes the ""controls help"" pannel. However, I have to press it every single game. which is annoying.Thanks for the nice game though, it's a lot of fun. I hope my review will help you enhance your game.			"

												2nd Review:Im Re-reviewing my review after a while. This game is still fun!, i just wanna warn other for the negative votes and tell the truth.This game is not based on luck and or such things!Yes you can spend money in the game (like all games anno now), but no you don't need to. To get skilled and or play league and or buy clothes you just need to play. You just wanna join a nice club and start sparing points and e-coins on events and try to unlock (ran out of time) clothes and buy them with 700 e-coins or unlock a nice extra skill for 600 or any of the other coin related items. You can play league, why not?Theres no P2W in this game only a P2Advantage, but it still comes to YOUR input on a keyboard or controller and not just some stats!This game is alot of fun and requires teamplay and such. It is only as easy as your own elo is. Dont cry cause this game can make you cry! It is a hate and love game, the types i love! This is not for quitters. The game is really underrated!Need help? pm me....peace......PASS ME THE BALL!1st Review:Why the hell isnt the whole world playing this game? ok the chat filters really suck tho, but this is fun!
