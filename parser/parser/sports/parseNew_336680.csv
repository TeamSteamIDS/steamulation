												An instant classic and one of the best games I've ever played. This game looks great and and has the most simplistic in depth strategic flare I wonder why I havent seen it anywhere before... Epic!			"

												Easy to get into, a surprisingly deep & original challenge. If you like board games you should pick this up in a sale or build a real board.			"

												A really nice board game that is simple enough that you anyone can get into but also complex enough that one have to put quite a lot of thinking into it in order win the game. Online Muliplayer is not supported yet as far as I know so its limited to LAN only.The graphic and gameplay is good with no form of bugs or glitches as of yet.I would recommend it but not worth the full price. Get it only on sale. (I got the game with 75% off sale)8/10			"

												I recommend getting it at the sale price, or trying to find free versions of the game.  Why?  It might not be everyone's cup of tea.  I have played 3 easy games so far.  I lost the first and won the other 2.I'm sure with enough time and study there will be strategies that immerge, but until then, it is a very alien playing field and having ANY IDEA AT ALL of what to do gives a disorienting feeling.That said, this is certainly deeper than checkers and approaching the depth of chess.  Probably not as deep as Go (but notice, it's in the same league as these very strong games).  The biggest difficulty is that for most moves there are at least 3, maybe 6 or more balls rolling around the board!  So to get my head around that is proving more than I bargained for when I bought the game, and it's challenging to say the least.  The whole board may look very different by the time your opponent finishes his move (which is really 3 moves).I can imagine getting good at it and getting to the point of predicting opponent's moves, but that seems like a huge stretch.  I'm happy just to find an openning for the current move - not even considering several moves ahead.But if you're not too worried about whether you'll get hooked, I recommend the game purely for the aesthetic beauty and genius of the game mechanic.  It is a simple mechanism, and beautiful to watch it play itself out, even if it makes me feel stupid in the process.  Hats off to the inventor of the game, and I'm happy to support this sort of ingenuity.This game begs to be played as a boardgame with a real board.			"

												TREBUCHET is classical board game where your goal a kill the enemy ""king"" or get your king to the opponent kings square. This game you will find in mobile devices too.Well, when im started to play this game, i never heard about it. In the past i remembed seed somewhere this classic board game in real life, but never played it. Now im fixing that issue. In this game now you will find a one and two player mode, in future its been updated with online multiplayer to. When you start a game you can choose from 3 difficulty levels and 2 board style (but i think a classical seems better). When you play, you can do 3 actions in each round, you can do two tilt and one move or one tilt and two moves. To destroy the enemy piece you should use at least two balls, to destroy the enemy balls you should use at least 3 balls. In a game your final goal is to kill the enemy ""king"" or get your king to the opponent kings square.The graphics looks clear and simple. The sound effects sounds good.So my verdict+good sound effect+nice classical board game+good animation+challenging +good to relax-a bit high price-no multiplayer at this moment (will be added in future)So this game is a classical board game, what you can now try out on pc too. This game challenging and can improve your strategical view. A price is a bit high, but if you find on sale and you are a fan of board games it can be instant buy to you.			"

												Ironically, the preview video above shows catapults, not trebuchets... Despite that glaring error, this game is a blast. It's great to see a new style of board game that forces me to use different mechanics than the traditional ""Classic-style"" board games. It's refreshing to build strategies and experiment with new ideas, new combinations, and overall new gameplay. I would *love* to find a physical version of this for my home!			"
