												Just writing a small review of my first impressions:- It seems to have that Rocket League-esque competitiveness to it- Easy to learn, hard to master- Super fun with friends (or alone!)- The retro/vaporwave design and feel is extremely well done (I love the narrator voices!)- The soundtrack is amazing- Tons of customization like arena variety, music, background color, narrator, etc.- Arcade mode for solo play, which is pretty fun- 1v1 to 3v3 games on local, private, exhibition and ranked- Price is actually really decentAll in all, definitely a buy. If you're not convinced, watch the trailer!			"

												I really like how this game combines all these different terms and moves from sports like a homerun, touchdown, etc. and throws them all into one simple and easy to play game.The game itself is simple enough, shoot a triangle and hit the ball into the opposing goal. It gets more complex and more like something along the lines of Lethal League when it adds in charging shots and countering ""slams"" as the game calls them. You can even put down a defensive block to stop the ball if you want.The premise is simple but there is strategy to going first, or countering the attack with a counter slam and making the attacker look like a fool by reflecting their own shot into their goal.It has a simple aesthetic and great color choices and two announcers to choose from. It's great simple fun for the whole family or your frienemies. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants a good, fun party game!			"

												VIDEOBALL is a great game!I would recommend you play it even with its' faults, which are minor. It would be 100% awesome if you just played entirely with likeminded friends in the same room as you. The design is pretty phenomenal.I wish you could change the main menu music and I wish you could set announcers to randomly switch or alternate between games.Possible downsides:- Online is cool but has a fair amount of host advantage, host always plays the game smoothly but the clients connected can often get some pretty bad lag with no way to check ping for any players, or cancel a match, or chat.- No dedicated 'quit'/'back' button that I can find, because every button is confirm.

												DISCLOSURE:I've met TIm at PAX a few times, I read his articles, and I think he's real cool, I paid for the game however.REVIEW:Scroll up to the trailer -- its claims are true. Winning does feel REAL good. The soundtrack is slick. The minimalist design is excellent (Jony Ives meets Johnny Madden).Now for some of my personal experience. You'll be screaming lots when you play. The game elements have a combinatorial thing going on, where even though there's only, like 7 types of objects in the game, and there will only be a dozen in your vicinity, that's still 7 to the 12th power number of situations you can be in, and it's never obvious what the best thing to do is. You have to strategize while having good gamer skillz to turn your strategies into action. You can be a hotshot and do sick plays with your chevron. You'll have that temptation to show off, whether it's a good idea or not.All in all, it's brilliant. Multiplayer games just keep getting better and better. This is one of the best ever made.Local MP is the main focus. The aforementioned screaming is better in person. It's one joystick and one button, so Grandma can hop in and figure it out in a few minutes, although an experienced Videoball player will still kick her wrinkly butt.There is online play, and it's a little sloppy -- it's hard to find a match sometimes, sometimes inviting friends doesn't work, sometimes there's goofy lag. Uh, whatever! It's good enough, and for a ten dollar game, it's gravy.There is however, one major threat to the well-being of this electronic sport. It's called VIDEOBLOOD Doping. Unscrupulous VIDEOBALLERS attempting to gain an edge in VIDEOBALL will inject themselves with blood that contains caffeine, taurine, and B12. This is a horrible practice and sets a poor example for young athletes. Please help me to raise awareness of this issue.			"

												There is a pretty small demographic that I am a part of, and due to there being little local PC games for party nights, I'll take anything I can find. I saw this game during a humble promotion first, and it looked like a simple and fun game. Recently however, that ""probably pick it up on a sale"" ideal turned to a must-buy after finding the game at a local convention I went to two days before release. I actually met the publisher of the game there, super cool guy by the way.PROS:Anyways, I have a lot of ground to stand on due to how many local PC games I play with others. VIDEOBALL managed to wow the first group I played it with earlier today. Simple controls and concept make the game easy to play for pretty much anyone. Throw a controller in anyone's hand and they will soon come to terms with how to play rather evenly to you. The gameplay turns hectic and so much fun, especially with more people. This is a game made to be played with others, and gameplay makes skill gaps as small as possible. There is a multitude of ways to play in basic terms. What I mean is you can play aggressively, defensively, focus on scoring from afar, amid the chaos, and many others. The variety of stages and customization to the rules make it easy to mix up the classic game to make it more interesting. Toying around with stages is extremely fun. By far the smallest thing I love about this game is the sound and visual design. A weirdly Nintendo aesthetic to the simple shapes and bright colors, and I swear the music is ripped from Wii Sports. It gives this game a wonderful lighthearted tone. My friends have to work really hard to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off with it.TL;DR VIDEOBALL's gameplay is engaging and simple to newcomers, and a warm and upbeat Nintendo feel make it simply fresh and fun.CONS:I haven't tried it myself, but I would assume that keyboard controls are completely unreliable. Pull out some wired console remotes to enjoy VIDEOBALL at it's full potential. As previously mentioned, the gameplay makes it easy for newer players while lowering the skill ceiling by quite a bit. I personally love that, since I don't accidentally go 10-1 to my other friends like in Duck Game, but some might not enjoy that. There is many tactics and ways to mix things up however. The menu's are my personal biggest problem with the game, adding a back button would really help menu navigation, and maybe give an option to limit control to player one because my friends are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who love to ruin everything when I set up the game.TL;DR Gamepads are the only way to go. A high skill ceiling makes mastery a more slight improvement rather than a massive advantage, and the menu's are a pain to control.OVERALL: Review scores are something I don't necessarily agree with, but if anything VIDEOBALL makes a clean 8/10. What I would say however is if you like Duck Game, Towerfall, and other quick match local games, VIDEOBALL will fit right in and deliver a amazing experience. If you need a game to satisfy a room full of friends and xbox remotes, VIDEOBALL will not disappoint you. VIDEOBALL is fun. VIDEOBALL is chaotic. VIDEOBALL is the funnest game I have played in a while.			"

												Even though I've only played a few local and online matches I can tell you this game is fantastic. It's the most polished $10 game I've  ever bought. The soundtrack is spot on as well.It has a very addictive arcade feel to it. I wasn't very excited for the game based on the trailer alone, but I became hooked  right after my first match. Everyone should give this a try. It's simple enough that even my mother watched me play it and immediately understood what was going on.			"

												A game of astounding depth, nuance, and intensity. A masterpiece of minimalist mechanics manifesting myriad makeshift methodologies. As pure an electronic sports game that has ever existed; this game is not merely an inferior simulation of a convoluted traditional sport (e.g. FIFA, Madden), but a novel sport designed specifically to take advantage of the videogame format and remove every remnant of that which is not absolutely vital to the game's thrust. You will find yourself agonizing over fractions-of-degrees on your attempted cross-court Downtown in a 9-9 game. You'll feel the exultant triumph of a game-winning Grand Slam. A sneaky Slam Dunk. A cocky Jam. Everything in this game *feels good*. It's a game that's as forward-thinking as it is reverent to gaming history. The design philosophy represents an ideal that has increasingly vanished from the aims of major development studios. Simply: a breath of fresh air.Highly recommended.			"

												Though the trailer is very well done and convinced me to get this game, it just doesn't hold interest for very long, especially with the only really 'fun' I could have existing in the multiplayer function. The multiplayer is difficult to access, though; it's difficult to find anyone playing the game without waiting a very long time, especially for matches with more than 2 persons.There are specific ways to hit the ball as well, which are never explained in game and are only referenced in the achievements, for example, I found out what a ""Home Run"" was by guessing, did a ""Jam"" by pure accident, and still have no idea what a ""Slam Dunk"" is or how to perform one.I'm sure it appeals to some group that isn't me, though, so if you're into VIDEOBALL™ or VIDEOBALL™-related activities, go for it.

												Videoball... Sorry, I need to clear my throat for this one...VIDEOBALL is an air hockey-Asteroids-Crossfire(the board game) mashup sports game where you shoot projectiles at the ball(s) and can use them to stun other players (including your teammates). Games can be 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 if you're feeling up for one VIDEOBALL match you'll never forget. The controls remind me of Asteroids except more floaty, but they're fine. I also appreciate the intuitiveness for just using the control stick and any one button to navigate though menus, though it can get somewhat confusing at times. It's not a horrible thing though. If you're a shut-in like me, you'll be glad that there's AIs, each with their own behaviors. You could have an AI for scoring, an AI for defending, and you, for.. Whatever you want to do, I guess. Even with the large amount of customization available in exhibition matches, there's also an arcade mode where you (and a friend (assuming you have any after kicking their♥♥♥♥♥in VIDEOBALL)) can play against predetermined AIs in several different arenas. There's also an online mode which I h̶a̶v̶e̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶t̶r̶i̶e̶d̶ ̶y̶e̶t̶ ̶(̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶u̶p̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶r̶e̶v̶i̶e̶w̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶I̶ ̶a̶c̶t̶u̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶o̶n̶e̶)̶.̶ tried and it's actually better than I expected with all the stuff that can be onscreen. Sure, there were a few hiccups here and there, but I played a 3v3 with little to no lag and that's awesome.So yeah, that's pretty much Video- VIDEOBALL. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go relax my throat again... After one more game of VIDEOBALL.Now my throat is dead. Meh.			"

												So, Videobal is here and you need to read a review to buy it? I disapprove but I'll try my best. Also, what's wrong with people leaving an online match after the first one? What it is christmas outside? Get real, play again.This is a real videogame, you can feel your brain building new connections while playing, the controls are amazing, there's depth to discover in every moment and angle. The music was composed by someone that surelly does this for a job, it's serious. The voice that does the commentary remind me of Real Human Basketball (another good one).I still hadn't the opportunity to play it locally, clearly it's the perfect game for screaming with friends. The online works despite a few launch problems.Only thing that I'm hating are the menu, the one button idea from divekick is not so cool, also the back button is often incoherently placed. There's no audio notification when the online player connects to your match and when an error happens online you can't see it since you are pressing the button and dismissing it immediatelly. When you have to select multiple CPUs locally it's a pain (UPDATE: it's a feature! they're different characters).But those are minor stuff, Tim Rogers basically doesn't care, the game is about people that can jump in the same room. The online will help ok if needed.BUY-IT.P.S. The police stealed this man car. That's the best reason you've got.			"

the digital entertainment sporting goodVIDEOBALL may seem simplistic at first glance, but take a look at it, and you’re looking at a very good model for adapting the adrenaline-filled world that is Sports to Video Games.SportsssssssssPros:Simple and relatively easy to understand, yet like all sports has a intriguing amount of depth to it.It’s retro presentation and unique style gives what is a simple game a lot of flash with its substance.Coda’s Soundtrack for the game is enjoyable and a good romp in matches.Local Play is fully customizable with a slew of unique bots, profiles, customization, and more!Nitpicks:The Online Netcode can be a mess due to it’s peer-to-peer connectionThe Arcade Mode’s AI makes for some fun challenges but the unique bots can be absolutely obnoxious at timesCons:Those that don’t play many local multiplayer games may find themselves limited in enjoyment due to the low online player count and the minimal content made for single-players.The ReviewVIDEOBALL is a game that can be understood by the time you’re done with your first match. VIDEOBALL is a game that has enough complexity to literally appear as it’s own, individual sport. Despite being confined to the contextual actions of the controller’s buttons and the code of it’s own engine, Videoball still plays like a emergent, energetic, and entertaining team-based sport.


VIDEOBALL

This is how VIDEOBALL works. You shoot triangles at these balls. Charge up your shots to shoot bigger triangles that have more strength. Push the balls to the enemy goal (like in Soccer/Football) to score points. Score Points to win. In execution, it just works. The game doesn’t feel convoluted or especially cluttered with it’s simplistic mechanics, rules, and map layouts, making it incredibly easy for anybody to pick up on the fly.With the simple pick-up-n-play design, VIDEOBALL becomes an absolute hit for parties and game nights. Practice isn’t required for people to play proficiently and it’s profile system allows for player statistics (goal tracking, amount of wins/loses, etc.). While it’s eSport appeal may not be as strong or nearly as successful as other games, it’ll definitely still be a stellar pick-up for someone wanting to bring some competition to their LAN Parties.Oh, and it has online-multiplayer as well! Which is nice, but it’s all peer-to-peer, meaning there’s a good chance your experience with it will be an absolute mess regardless. It has leaderboards, 3v3 matches, and Team Matchmaking, so it isn’t just some cookie-cutter online experience. However, don’t rely on it for finding matches though, as the player count is unfortunately incredibly weak for the game at the time.Those looking for some single-player action may also find themselves a bit on the short-end on the stick. However, there is Arcade Mode, which presents a series of challenges against unique bots that while don’t come close to capturing the thrill of the multiplayer matches, are OK and decent puzzle-like challenges. The bots included while are unique, often can be obnoxious with following simplistic patterns and behaviors that can be aggravating to counter alone.


that'LL DO VIDEOBALLERS

It’s presentation is incredibly slick to top off the rest of the package, however. It’s minimalistic design carries on to it’s aesthetic of popping colors and simple visuals. The game itself evokes the unique humor and personality found in its trailers/promotional material, with it’s cheesy narrators and constant branding of itself as a digital entertainment sporting good. And also, it’s soundtrack is pretty decent, with coda providing incredibly energetic and enjoyable tracks to go along in the background.The final package of VIDEOBALL may be a bit lacking for those expecting a single-player experience, but for everyone looking for a fun local-multiplayer game, you are absolutely in luck! VIDEOBALL is one of the most elegantly designed multiplayer games I’ve ever played, and you shouldn’t miss out on it if you frequent LAN Parties.TL;DR - [VIDEOBALL is fun, VIDEOBALL is great for local-multiplayer parties, VIDEOBALL is VIDEOBALL.]  RECOMMENDED FOR MULTIPLAYER GAMERS.

												Videoball is a sport defined by the millisecond differences between success and failure. You charge shots. You position yourself at optimal scoring position. If any enemy shot hits you you are knocked off of your trajectory and your charge disappears. Shot power isn't linear -- shots come in discrete shot types. It takes time to charge to a particular shot type. Videoball is all about the bargain between the right time to shoot and the right shot type to shoot with.Charging to certain shot types -- the level 3 shot, for example -- is terrifying. Seeing an enemy's level 3 shot hit the ball is even more terrifying. Videoball is a test of how well you can deal with pure terror.Winning at Videoball always feels like an impossible event, something that can never happen -- even after you've already won a hundred times. No matter who you play against in Videoball, Videoball is a fight against giants. Literally, the closest game to Videoball is Shadow of the Colossus. Videoball is what Shadow of the Colossus was supposed to feel like.			"

												I always thought this game was cool ever since I played it years back at PAX East but I was always worried that it would only really work with 2 on 2 (and in my situation it is much easier to get a 1 on 1 local game going). After playing it for several hours I can say that 1 on 1 holds up well and is very fun to play. That combined with decent bots allowing for an OK 2 on 2 experience (1 player and a bot on each side) makes the game worth it for me. Due to the niche nature of the game if you want to do online play you will probably have to set it up with friends. The local experience is great if you are in a situation where that is possible.My major complaint is probably the inflexibility of the online play. You cannot do multiple local players + online. You cannot add bots online. There is no server browser or any sort of indication of how many people are online. Do not buy this game expecting to play with randoms online. Also there are some small PC issues such as lack of an exit button and not being able to skip the Unity launcher, but supposedly these are being worked on and hopefully will be patched soon.Note: I probably have a low amount of hours played on this account. This is due to me mostly playing this game locally on a seperate family shared account.			"

												Great local multiplayer game with suprisingly deep mechanics. Online has no server list, two different playlists, no bots, no splitscreen online, and couldn't find anyone playing. There is also no quit button, ALT-F4 is the only way out. If you have at least one other person to play this with then it's worth it, just don't expect to play online.			"

												VIDEOBALL's really good.This game's simple mechanics provide a lot of emergent depth. As you get more familiar with the game, you begin to fully understand and appreciate all the four different charge levels for shots.This game makes you feel good: scoring a touchdown, aiming a level two triangle perfectly so it can push the ball across the court, being advantageously blasted by an opponent into a better position, reversing a level three shot, etc. You're bound to encounter countless feel-good moments in every single game.This game's at its best as a local multiplayer game, where you can sit down with some buds and play the game latency-free. However, there is an online mode. Although you're unlikely to find an open random lobby, you definitely can play online if you coordinate with the friendly folks in the official Discord server, where people are setting up ranked matches throughout the day. Or you could play with your friends online of course. It's unfortunate you can't just pop in a game, but it's not too inconvenient to coordinate.There can be some latency online for everyone who isn't the host, but it's not unbearable for me usually and I still have fun.If you're into competitive games and you have friends to play with or are willing to join the Discord server, you should consider buying this game.Also you should play with a controller.

												It's Videoball! It's the newest sport in the world! It's much less confusing than Aussie Rules Football, but slightly more confusing than playing with a frisbee! However, consider this: Videoball can not get caught in a tree. Playing Videoball will not result in physical injury. Videoball has a much better soundtrack than a youth-league ice hockey game. It has better announcers than the NFL. It's Almost as good as tennis. One day, you will look at a Videoball player, and you will have the same feelings you had when you first saw Roger Federer - that's a promise. It's Videoball! Get it on your computer and play it!

												Decent game, way overhyped in the reviews/media I read and saw about it before purchasing. Online Mode is a waste, nobody is ever on. Totally baffling they have that as a selling point, do these guys not realize you have to have OTHER PEOPLE online to actually use the mode? Arcade Mode is nothing special, fun at first but gets repetitive. If you know a ton of people who'd like to play and have extra controllers then Local Mode could be fun.			"

Online is possible but I havent tried it so I cant speak to the netcode.  Excellent game feel and an aesthetic that is pleasing and doesnt get in the way of the gameplay.Don't let the terribly annoying announcer in the trailer turn you off; this game is great.			"

												VIDEOBALL is a great game game with a simple premise, easy to approach graphics and controls (move and shoot), and a design which allows new players to immediately enjoy playing (or watching) VIDEOBALL, while masters still enjoy honing their skills. The only problem with VIDEOBALL at the moment is that it is hard to find multiplayer games due to them not being backed by some giant studio, the only solution to this problem is for you to buy VIDEOBALL.

												I don't know why people like this game. I really don't. There's no tactics, no real teamplay, stunlocks, multiple centers of attention, everybody is doing his own thing, just random shooting of everything that moves. The game itself is well made, local+online mp and all, but the gameplay leaves much to be desired! If you are looking for a clusterpuck alternative...this ISN'T it!Edit: Just to clarify, I've been playing the game in local coop and I've watched several gameplay videos (incl. Giant Bombs) and my experience just underlined what I was seeing in the videos.			"

												4.6/10 (Mediocre 2-D ""shooty ball into goal"" game)(EDIT, i will add this disclaimer: alot of this is MY opinion on the game, so alot of this is not true nor false. this is not meant to anger anyone and if it does please be professional about it. thanks)(SECOND EDIT, i changed the review score to be fair as this could be bound to change due to update)The game had high hopes, but at the last second it went down the road as possibly the most annoyingly hard to play ""shoot the ball into the goal"" game i have ever seen. The controls are stiff  and the gameplay is just too fast and challenging for a newcomer to games like this (like me). Now let's adress the controls. On a PS4 controller (don't even attempt to play with a keyboard), the main controller i use(d), was confusing. It was like having controls that say: ""Anawog styck muves d aoww an evwy butin iz feyre"". Moving to the gameplay. The gameplay is waaaaaaaaaaay too fast and the levels are just too damn small to do anything in. Charging a shot takes too long and by the time you do get a high charge, you've hit someone and your charge resets! Now combine that with the controls of this game and ""Volia!"": You have a Mediocre 2-D team based goal game with annoying controls, stiff and annoyingly complicated gameplay and a dissapointed gamer. THOUGH: i will give it the benefit of the doubt here and say that i will probably shift an opinion here if i feel like it.			"

Simple but competetive fun for little money. Great.Eventhough this kind of game is ideally played in Couch Multiplayer, they have included Online as well, which is great for people without or far away from friends to play this great game with.The are how ever few players in matchmaking, thus it is difficult to find an online game, especially ranked. I do not know who's fault this is. Also, there is no actual exit-button it seems, so you have to manually close it down by going to the desktop or using Task Manager. Weird.			"
