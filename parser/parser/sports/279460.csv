												don't even think about the rating of the teams in this game it doesn't matter.  the ai is also set to only foul if you get close to them.			"

												Controls are shotty at best, the gameplay doesnt flow, will probably give it a second chance. I am going to bank on my terrible knowledge of handball as to why this game isnt very good. It feels a little dated but I am no snob. I purchased on sale for fairly cheap. Everything feels like this was a game made by accident.			"

												I do not understand why this game gets such poor reviews. I am an avid sports gamer, and I love the old along with new. Yes the graphics are dated, but the gameplay is not. I really enojoy playing this game as it is unique and I only saw a bit of this sport while stationed in Germany. If you are like me and an overall avid sports gamer, this game is worth getting for your library. This game is not for the faint of heart, it is challenging. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE THIS GAME TO THE LIKES OF FIFA, MADDEN, THE SHOW, OR 2K SPORTS.IHF IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN, WHAT I TERM AS NOVELTY SPORTS GAMES.			"

												As a fan of Handball an d a player myself, I followed the developement of the game closely, and was happy when I bought it. I didn't expected much... but I was still disappointed. KI is basically not existing, neither on the own team (standing in perfect offensive Formation is nice....but not when your own goalkeeper has the ball and is looking for a player to throw it to), nor on the other. And what bugs me the most is, that the most significant errors should be fixed pretty easy, e.g. the given example. I was only able to stand it for some minutes, I don't think I even played it for an hour... it was just...sad			"

												Buy the cheaper, better IHF Handball Challenge 12 instead of this. The only two things better with this game is that you can make the spin shot, which is really nice, but most of all the hilarious and cringe announcers; Basically it's a Swedish and a German announcer trying to talk English with really broken accents and with no feelings or empathy at all for the game or plays. It's really funny and cringeworthy so if you have the money it's worth to get just for them (you can also watch gameplay on YouTube for free). They're also not tested properly and do not tell the score, says wrong lines about situations and keep making stupid and unrelated comments about their job. Other than that this game is a disaster and is even badder than its predecessor IHF Handball Challenge 12, which is actually a really good game. You can read my review for it on its page if you want the pros and cons and why I fell in love with it despite its awful graphics and mechanics.			"

												I was waiting for this game.. It was over advertised, took a long time to develop.. but the final result is probably the worst game I ever bought and played. Totally disapponted by this game. And I'm sure many handballers and fans will be as disappointed. It was probably better to make an ""Handball Manager""-ish game, instead, giving the result. Difficult to play, embarassing animations (we're almost in 2015)... I expected something better, since the game has been advertised four / five years ago!!			"
