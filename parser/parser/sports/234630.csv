├Professors Review┤Game Pros• Clean menu• Beautiful Graphics• Smooth Gameplay• VR Hardware Support• A lot of different controller supports• Decent selection of cars to choose from• Manual or Auto Transmission optional• Damage effects car performance (If enabled in race setup, you can make pit stops to fix damage)• Weather Effects car performance • Online Play (And private races for just you and friends)• In-depth car statistics while racing (Tire heat, Vibration, RPM..etc)• Text bubbles help you with complicated mechanics Game Cons• Non-friendly to players new to racing games• No full on multiclass races• The AI doesn't know when it's appropriate to let someone pass and ends up crashing into you• You get penalized due to fault of another player forcing you to go off track• AI ignores flagging system (Wont get all the same penalties you would)Relateable Games• Forza (Only in a few aspects) ConclusionProject Cars is a realistic racing game. While racing you must account for everything. This isn't another racing game where you can speed through corners to pass up other racers. One little mistake can cost you the race. So if you are looking for a racing experience that allows you to make many tests of trials and error to create your own personal setup. Then this is the game for you.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

												I’ve played a lot of Project Cars, but I’ve had enough and I doubt I’ll go back to it.  It’s a nice looking game, at 4K resolution and with the video settings maxed out runs very smoothly on my system.  There is a wide selection of cars (if you buy the DLC) and plenty of tracks, but that all counts for nothing when so many other areas of this game are sorely lacking. The opponent AI in Project Cars is absolutely dreadful; It appears to be almost pathologically incapable of not colliding with you.  It has this apex or nothing mentality, which means if you actually try to race with it through a corner there is almost bound to be a collision. By way of comparison I’ve been playing Assetto Corsa again recently and the AI - while not perfect -  is so much better, you can actually race closely with it through corners without the constant likelihood of being rammed off the track. At any track with a tight first corner (Oschersleben, Nurburgring Sprint and GP for example) there is almost always a huge pile-up there on the first lap, where the race will sometimes grind to halt altogether, I think this is caused by the aforementioned apex fixation.  I’ve also seen AI cars actually collide with the end of the pit-wall on the way out of the pit-lane and spin, although this appears to have been patched by simply making the AI cars able to ghost through anything (including your car) when they exit the pits. So much for realism. The AI also cheats constantly. It’s able to cut corners and chicanes and go outside of the track limits with impunity.  Being able to set qualifying laps and gain race positions by doing things that you would be penalised for. I've seen some pathetic excuses on the Project Cars forum that the AI is just ""making mistakes"", yeah right.  Also in practice and most qualifying sessions you have to warm up your tyres on your out-lap, but the AI is just able to go at full racing speed straight out of the pits. Similarly, the AI is also able to traverse gravel traps and grass without losing any speed, where your car would quickly grind to a halt.  After the first two or three seasons the career mode becomes really dull. Apart from the one or two race series you unlock by completing career objectives, you have the same championships you had before at the same tracks in the same order with the same weather.  There’s this cringe worthy “Fan Chat” feature in career mode which is basically a feed of repetitive comments with your driver’s name copied and pasted into them with a wince inducing hashtag at the end.  Whenever a racing game tries to incorporate a faux “social media” element (GRID 2 for example), it just looks a bit sad and desperate and this is no exception.   Flag rules are also poorly implemented, blue flags in particular are a joke.  On a qualifying lap at Barcelona I pass a car as it’s coming out of the pits on the main straight, then on the way into the first corner I’m shown a blue flag because that same car is behind me albeit some distance away.  Just laughable, which pretty much sums this game up, a game I've uninstalled and consigned to the backwaters of my steam library.			"

												If you do not have a wheel, and only have an xbox controller, I advise you to replicate the settings that I have below, in the controller settings in project cars. If you do not do this, you will hate the game. This game may not be as good as Assetto Corsa in terms of steering, handling, and over all life-like simulations; but it is better in terms of online matchmaking (with friends) and graphics. Overall, the game has decent simulation physics. I recommend this for anyone who simply wants to just ride along a track with a group of friends.

												Firstly I'd like to say that most of the negative reviews of this game are completely unjustified. I see reviews of people complaining that this is a bad game because it is too hard, or the car spins when you accelerate or something like that. This is an authentic simulator, not a casual race game. It has been intricately designed to feel like genuine driving, and the people who complain about this don't seem to realise that. Then you have people who complain about controls, and I'll say the same thing. This is a simulator. Its supposed to be realistic, and I don't know about you, but I've never driven a real car using a keyboard and mouse. It works best with a wheel, and as they are expensive, a controller is the next best option. You will find it hard with a keyboard. That isn't a problem with the game, thats a problem because you bought a game you couldn't play.This game is incredible. It is beautiful, diverse and customisable. Every aspect of a race, from weather to driving assists, can be changed. There is a huge range of vehicles and tracks, I have owned the game on Xbox for several months and I still haven't tried all the cars. You can practice on your own, or against AI, or you can move online, or go to campaign mode and start from the bottom as a karting driver or from the top as a formula one professional. The game is limitless in its possibilities. Many people don't realise, but the CARS in the name actaully stands for Community Assisted Racing Simulator. This means that simulator enthusiasts have helped build the game, contributing ideas, or testing it out. The game wasn't made by another standard company just trying to churn out a new game. It was intricately designed and it really shows.So please, please, please do not listen to the negative reviews. From what I can tell, 99% of negative reviews are people complaining about:A) the game is too hardB) the game doesn't run very wellC) they had a technical issueUltimately, these aren't problems with the game. A technical issue can be fixed with a siple Google search, or by talking to the devs. Performance issues are an issue with your PC, not the game. These people are not reviewing the game, they are reviewing there negative experiences - and it makes the game look bad. It is not.So if you are into racing games and prepared for a challenge, get Project Cars. If you're a casual gamer with a low spec pc, go get Need for Speed or something.			"

 TL;DR  Game is great, but there are  better options to choose from considering the ammount you pay for Project Cars with its DLC's.  My Thoughts on Project Cars: First of all, there was a lot of hype for Project Cars the weeks before its release. Initially, the game seemed fun to me, especially with its one-of-a-kind Career Mode - only to be brought with the disappointment that you could start wherever you want in your career, therefore losing the motive in grinding your way from Go-Karts to Formula A. Although there are a lot of downvotes to the game there are a lot of good sides to the game. Pros:  The In-Game Menu is one of the best I've seen in quite a while.  Graphics are absolutely facinating.  Gameplay is fairly smooth, rarely come across visual / physical bugs.  Controller support is one of the best, also comes with VR Hardware support too.  A lot of Online Lobbies to choose from, if not, create a private lobby for you and your friends.  In-game car tuning has a lot of depth, a lot of things to tune, giving you an upper-hand above those who don't.Mehs:   Car statistics, usual car stats a game would bring you.  Mechanic is a meh, when it comes to long races, sometimes the mechanic would get on my nerve.  Physics are alright, usually a bugs here and there but it doesn't affect the gameplay too badly.Cons:  The In-game AI is generally a let-down.   AI doesn't really let you pass on blue flags, sometimes won't even aknowledge your existence on the race track, ramming you left and right.  Penalty system is also disappointing  Sometimes you will get penalized for things you didn't even do, such as corner cutting.  Penalty system also doesn't affect the AI, giving them the upperhand in races  Car selection doesn't include one of the biggest brands and icons (as of Jan 4, 2016) Ferrari, Nissan  SAFETY CAR WHERE YOU AT?? YELLOW FLAG WHERE YOU AT?? Games I Would Suggest or Relate to 
 Assetto Corsa Conclusion  Project Cars is a fairly fun and realistic racing game, and has a small mix of Arcade and Simulation (may not be the best idea). If you're looking for a more realistic game, look for iRacing. If you're looking for an arcade-y style game, I would personally suggest Need for Speed. Overall Project Cars was an initial disappointment to me but the deeper you look into what the game has to offer to you, the funner it gets. (If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!)  If you're looking for more Steam Friends? Look no more - feel free to add me!  "

												I had a very popular positive review up for this game until now. Over the past year my opinion has changed.I play with a racing wheel and play a lot of racing games and sims (all Codemasters games, iRacing, rFactor 2, RaceRoom,...).I'll keep it short:The good- It looks great and runs pretty well on Nvidia graphics cards- With DLC there is a good amount of content available and a nice selection of tracks & cars.- Some cars sound fantastic, others rather mediocre- A lot of settings are available- Full day/night cycle and weather (imo the best thing about this game)- No tuning and almost no street cars, this game is about racing race cars on a race track.- Solid career mode with a good amount of diversity.- You can do 24h multi class racing and even switch drivers like in real life so you don't have to drive the 24h completely on your own.The bad- The AI is garbage and inconsistent. Sometimes they are slow, sometimes they are overly aggressive BUT they ALWAYS CHEAT. Seriously, the AI is cheating and that just kills off any enjoyment I had with this game. They drive like maniacs in the rain and somehow have more grip than I ever had on soft tyres on a sunny day. Furthermore they can brake much later and never lock up. On some parts of the track they have problems with overtaking, so either they ram you off the track or crash into another AI car. Terrible.- The physics are mediocre but that's no surprise and not really a bad thing in my eyes. What's terrible is the force feedback. This has to be some Need For Speed level of force feedback because you can't feel anything on the default settings. You don't know what the car is doing half of the time. If you want to play this game with a wheel then I recommend to take a day off of work to find some force feedback settings that work for you.- Multiplayer is either dead or a complete cluster♥♥♥♥. Everyone crashes and drives like an idiot. Don't buy this game for online racing if you are looking for some clean and exciting fights. Either join a league or take a look at iRacing.- No triple monitor support. Game looks terrible on three screens.- Career had a ""coming soon"" section for almost a year until they finally removed it with the last patch.- A lot of features were cut and will make it into Project Cars 2.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage model- No safety car, no formation lap, no yellow flags- The track stays the same during the whole race. In real life the track builds up more grip on the racing line, which makes it harder to overtake off the racing line. That's very interesting in endurance races (2h-24h races) but in Project Cars the track stays the same, no matter how many laps you do.- You can't select specific opponents in a race. You can either select ""Identical"" (same car as you), ""Same class"" (for example GT3 class if you use a GT3 car) or ""Multi class"" (a random selection of all cars in the game). Not sure who thought this was a good idea but you can't make your own WEC race for example, because the game will mix in some random garbage vehicles that don't even fit in the 24h of le mans. - The game had hundreds of bugs and missing features on launch and it took them 10+ patches to make the game somewhat decent.Verdict:Graphics powerhouse with a nice selection of tracks and cars. But when it comes to racing it is one of the worst racing games you can get, made by a company that over promises and under delivers.			"

												It's hard to quantify what's wrong with this game in exact, concise words. Yes, on paper, everything this game includes, especially in GOTY form, sounds like an absolutely excellent package, but it's a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" situation, and even then, it's only decent at those trades at best.Positives first. It is very visually striking, and that absurd insistence that so many racing games have nowadays of making the cars impossibly, constantly shiny is absent in actual gameplay. The track list is impressive, and the original / un-licensed courses are excitingly original or amusingly just ever-so-slightly off. The Azure Coast and California Highway point-to-point races are extremely gorgeous, with the latter's bridge giving me vibes of Daytona USA. Azure Circuit and Sakitto fill in for Monaco and Suzuka, and I'm still loving that the Japanese circuit is literally just named Circuit but with a Japanese accent. All the courses included just feel right (except for Laguna Seca somehow), and it's a pretty excellent globetrotting collection.The car list, at least with DLC, is a bit scattered, but you'll generally find something exciting to enjoy even if you don't recognize the name right away. I found the Superkarts to be a welcome surprise that I heavily underestimated at first, the LMP vehicles impressively powerful and forcing me to change my racing line as I considered the automatic KERS usage, and the Caper Monterrey fit my need for classic American stock cars quite well (at least partially).The career mode is a simple calendar-and-event format akin to Dirt to Daytona, and it works pretty well aside from the blatantly bugged/repetitive emails and fan praise you receive. My number one praise for it is something that racing games in general need to learn how to do: DLC courses and cars actually are included, with their own events unlocked on the calendar as you progress if you have them. They aren't just awkwardly shunted to a free play portion of the game. They're part of the core experience. That's a massive plus.However, after a while, the career mode just isn't enjoyable. That's not so much a fault of repetitive events, or my unnecessary compulsion to play every single event in order when I could just come back to them later. The problem is the AI.The AI is a massive failure.So, racing in go-karts, yeah, I can see a little bit of bumping and slamming. It's go-karts! I'm being aggressive, too. Stock cars, yeah, they'll charge a bit hard in the turn, so of course the drivers would be thrown off. GT endurance racers smashing each other off the track? Well, that's a little silly!Starting an F1 (renamed Formula A in-game) race and immediately getting plowed into by the driver behind me, who digs into my wheelwell and chucks me into a ditch before the entire rest of the field dogpiles them and brings the race to an immediate screeching halt with the screams of tires and smashing of car bodies, showering the track in debris and caking the road in crushed cars? Bad. Very bad. It ended up very, very consistently like this regardless of difficulty adjustment. It cannot (noticably) tell the difference between different vehicles in terms of racing lines and aggression.Now, you might just be thinking, ""well, maybe you just suck at this"". Fair enough. I don't play sims often. I got stuck in rFactor immediately because I didn't think to shift the car into neutral to leave the pit lane. But I'm getting better at that. This? This is not a sim. It's not a simcade racer, either, not entirely. It's trying to be both, and again, it's aggressively mediocre in many regards because of that. It very much enjoys spinning the player and AI alike out, and recovery is nigh-impossible. A massive array of tuning options and an insistence on actual reasonable racing lines bodes well for it being a fine sim, but the actual physics and AI behavior just don't line up with that, reverting to cartoony slides and demolition derbies in short order.And full disclosure? I'm particularly furious that this game was supposed to have an oval racing mode, hence the stock cars even being included, but they gave up on it, allegedly after issues with the AI being incapable of navigating the ovals in a satisfactory manner. The AI is incapable of navigating anything, though. As such, the US Car Pack stands out as a purposeless shell, including IndyCar and NASCAR vehicles for tracks that never came to fruition, and that's after they already licensed, mapped, and rendered Indianapolis Motor Speedway! They just threw it out and said they'd try again in the sequel.In any case, yes, there are brief moments of fun here, and simply ogling the cars is probably money's worth in itself. I don't entirely regret my purchase. But it's such a weak roster for each discipline it represents that this is simply a stopgap appetizer before you go and buy whatever game includes the disciplines you like most. It tries to be everything and, as such, stretches itself extremely thin, extremely quickly. It's a wide array of shallow kiddy pools rather than one immersive but limited dunk tank.But hey, it's pretty, right?			"

												Beautiful, polished, great driving physics and a dynamic envrionment make this racing game very appealing at first glance. However after spending some time with this game I have been dissapointed with the immersion this game offers as there are many features missing that a racing simulator should have. 1. There is no flag system or safety car. This gripe may seem nit picky but it does take away from the simulator feel of a race day when there are no flags to warn drivers that there may be a hazard ahead. Flags and safety cars are a huge feature in modern racing, often changing the outcome of a race and entire strategies devoted to pitting around safety car deployment. This leads into the second gripe, there are no AI caused accidents for there to be a safety car or flag system in the first place. 2. AI too flawless. The AI has no character in this game, they drive around almost on rails only to deviate in the most extreme cases occasionally onto the grass but then make a full recovery and lose 1 second on their lap time due to a small mistake. They are aware of the player, but too often they will completely give way to the player as if repelled by magnets. The biggest problem with the dull AI is that there are no retirements no matter how long the race is. 100 Lap races will 100% of the time have a full field finish, no mechanical faults, no accidents, no spins, even with full damage turned on. The AI does not make a mistake that leads to any game changing events. This makes for a very dull, boring race experience.  3. The career mode only offers a single full season of driving (17 races in a season) in one mode, the F1 equivalent Formula A mode. If you want to drive touring cars or karts or any other league the season is made up of only 5 or so races. It is kind of like the progress of simcade racing games like GT and Forza, just without the upgrades and car modifying and street circuits. 4. Every car is as solid as a tank. The damage modelling in this game reminds me of an old Need for Speed where you were able to drive at 300kmh and crash into any solid object and just bounce off. Damage is a huge component of racing, often slight damage will lead to changing a racing strategy and adds a huge element of risk/reward to a race. Damage is what keeps a race on the edge, gives a race character. Drivers will avoid taking huge risks because damage is a deterrent, and damage affects performance. Not in this game though, damage for the most part does nothing. You can use other cars as a brake with little consequence. Crash into a wall head on at 200kmh, and you will suffer slight suspension problems and get a couple of cosmetic scratches and a bent hood. That kind of a crash in reality would end with a DNF and debris everywhere. Since there is no deterrent to crashing in this game, the only solid tactic for racing is an aggressive push all the other cars off the road style. The surface of the game is really spectacular, it will easily draw you in and look amazing, but don't be fooled. This is not what I would expect from a racing simulation, it sits halfway between a Forza/Gran Tourismo and a racing sim, but does neither very well. It is not an arcade game where you can customise your cars and earn a sense of progression with unlocking newer nicer vehicles and new modifications. It is not a simulator where you can immerse yourself into the reality of a race day. Project Cars lacks any character or vision for what it is, and in attempting to appeal to a very broad audience it has alienated the fans of both arcade and simulator fans alike by providing neither. If you just want a game where you have the opportunity to drive around very pretty circuits with traffic and time trials then this game might be sufficient. It feels great looks great and sounds great. But it really lacks in the gameplay department so if you want a game that simulates racing, then I recommend you look elsewhere.  "

												I've put a lot of time into Project CARS, and frankly, I'm fed up.  So I'm going to give a long and thorough review of it.TL/DR Version:  Broken promises, missing game features, and crippling bugs should keep you away.  Ultimately, this entire things feels like a giant paid BETA for Project Cars 2.  I.E. You are paying full retail for the privilege of beta testing for the sequal.Pro's:PCars is relatively cheap.  $50 retail + $50 DLC sounds like a lot, but compared to other sim racing games, it isn't.  Fully investing in ""iRacing"" could easily cost you $500+ ($10-$15 per car / track, EACH), not to mention the $15 per month subscription.Amazing GT3 selection.Best graphics of any racing sim, by far.  Best weather system of any racing sim, by far.No cars are gated at all.  First race, want to try an F1 Car?  Go for it!  Even people without DLC can join a DLC room (but they can't host it, or play it in SP).Clever and fun Single Player campaign.  You can jump in anywhere from GoKarts and advance all the way to LMP1, and anything in between, all the while progressing through it from where you started.  I.E. Start at Formula Gulf (not go-karts) and still advance through to LMP1.Physics system is leagues better than from release, but still not perfect or finished yet.  Tire physics are trash.Relatively good VR / headtracker support.  (They just broke Headtracker support, though.)Con's (in no particular order):No Oval Racing, despite being promised and advertised.Replay system is utterly broken.  Some cars don't show up at all.  Some don't ever start off the line.  Some have switched models and skins.  And the control system was designed by a 2 year old.  Don't even bother to save a replay.Spectator system is trash.  What good is a racing game if you can't give people a good way to watch the action?Dedicated Server is missing half the features it needs to be viable, including race steward powers..Multiplayer sessions are missing half the features IT needs (separately from ded. servers) to be viable in the long run.Options available in Single Player Campaign are not available for custom and multiplayer races.No full course cautions option.There is a skill / safety rating system built into every driver's profile, but we can't see other people's rating.  Absolutely moronic.There is a collision measuring and fault system built into Project Cars, but it isn't used for anything.  For example, after 3 dive bombs it could kick out the bad driver, but doesn't.Some of the maps are broken and unplayable in Multiplayer.  Including maps that have been in the game since day 1.There is an entire Map Pack DLC that is basically unusable in Multiplayer because they don't have pit lanes.Pit stop system is unintuitive, hard to use, and broken / bugged.  Sometimes the system doesn't give you tires when you ask.  And Visa Versa.  You are also limited to a TOTAL number of pit stop strategies over all of the cars available.  Furthermore, pits give you gas, then tires, with no option to select otherwise (like simultaneous) or select class based setup.Almost a year after release, there is only the 1 option for Race Modes:  The standard race.  There are no other modes, even as gimicks.  You can guess that people are getting tired of it.There are still some ""tuning"" tricks (bugs) that make cars go faster than they should.There is no way to save a tuning file, import one, or export it.  Everything has to be transcribed manually from in game to out, and back.No viable option for a custom skins.All multiplayer games go through steam.  Steam goes down, your race room dies, even in the middle of a race.  I.E. Steam isn't just a match making service, it is a server hub for the race and all of PCars.Qualifying results are wiped if someone is DCed.  They are not attached to the Steam ID like they should be.No ""Tow back to pits"" option if you get damaged.  So basically you have to try to drive back, and endanger everyone else on the way.No ability to reconnect to a server if you get DCed mid race.There is a ""Time-out"" function to prevent people from connecting late in a session (practice, qual...).  I can't tell you the number of times I've seen someone bust their ♥♥♥ to practice for hours and get entirely locked out of a race because the game won't let them connect when there is 2:20 left, rather than 2:40.  Absolutely moronic.There is the option to host a race that is 24 hours long, but you are not able to switch drivers.  Why freaking bother?Some of the weather options are broken and don't work.The in game spotter system is absolutely crap.  He doesn't spot for you, nor does he actually say anything useful or worthwhile.  (Though someone has made a 3rd party spotter APP that is amazing.)Hard enforced ""Cut Track Penalties"" which force you to slow down immediately (often in front of other cars who can't avoid it fast enough).No real mod support, specifically Steam Workshop use.  This game could have lived for years, if it had.Multiplayer Rooms are dying, apparently 10 months of crippling bugs and missing vital functions is too much for some people.  Most of the time 50% of a room leaves when it's clear that they won't win (see built in skill / safety system bulletin).VAC doesn't seem to ban cheaters (not implying that there are any at all), all it does is ban people who rejoin too many times, or gives off a false positive.  (There is no way for a regular server to turn it off, too.)The lobby chat system is broken.  You can't type anything in or see anything others in the lobby chat have typed.  You must be driving to type and see.NEW GAMEBREAKING BUG: There are invisible walls in the middle of the track.  Imagine driving down the middle of the road, and your car smashes into something invisible.  Guess what happens to a car at 180 MPH when it comes to a sudden stop.NEW GAMEBREAKING BUG: Cut tracks are now broken.  They are applied inconsistently, and sometimes get stuck.  Since you are hard forced into slowing down, the cut-track penalty getting stuck kills you.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Cars spawn in to the starting grid sidewise, upside down, backwards...  I.E. The game doesn't work sometimes when the race starts!OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED: Sometimes when the race is over, the final results splash screen doesn't show up.  I.E. The entire room breaks, and you can't see what happened in the race.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Rolling starts don't work.  AT ALL.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Sometimes the game locks up on loading.NEW GAMEBREAKING BUG:  Tire system is broken.  Soft tires last as long as mediums or hards.  There is little to no real tire degradation.  There is very little tire strategy due to them being broken.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED: Severe controller (wheel) issues.  Sometimes the steering ratio is borked when you start up, and requires a game restart.  Some people get FFB bugs.  Some people need to recalibrate every single time they start up the game.  Horrible controller support for a full retail game.So to sum up, Project Cars 1 is missing a LOT of basic, necessary functions a racing game needs to be just a normal racing game.  Maybe Project Cars 2 will fix it, but after fully investing in PCars1 and getting stiffed, I'll not be buying PCars2.Edit:  After seeing the utter incompetence of WMD in not fixing their game, I've decided to list the remaining gamebreaking bugs I hadn't yet listed.

You can find many more on youtube.And this image below is the remarkable post by Ian Bell, head studio of Slighty Mad Studios (that he erased it  because he was getting too much love for it): http://i.imgur.com/J7wCj0X.pngupdate as of december 2015: here is a more in-depth review of this ""updated"" game, because mine is like Pcars in a nutshell http://steamcommunity.com/id/kacperflak/recommended/234630/Also... patch v6.0? They need to learn to count. More like v1.0.0.6 with a lot of paid DLC released while they (don't) fix the game. My old review stands still below.1-It's not finished to the point where is playable due to the many bugs. It's a beta and they released either way when it should be delayed a bit more2-Ian Bell is a d1ckhead when it comes to deal with criticism about his work and customers that don't agree with him3-They are not commited to fix the issues like they were while in closed beta where we had almost a new build with fixes and improvements per day4-They are already announcing Project Cars 2 without even fixing the first iteration of the franchise without any hesitation5-They expect crowd funding the second game like the first one, so they can raise another truckload of money, do a lot of PR bull♥♥♥♥ marketing again to sell it, and then run off the scene without even trying to finish the product, like they are doing with this one. REALLY? I mean... WTF! Good luck getting support with that. Maybe your closed community of proud crowdfounder fools will do. It's a shame, nonetheless.			"

Ladies and Gentlemen start your engines and prepare yourself for an experience which will redefine your perceptions on what a racing game is and provide hundreds of hours of entertainment.TLDR: If you enjoy racing games you should definitely buy this game and if you do not normally play racing games you should still seriously consider buying it.Project CARS has always been about developing the best racing game possible, within the budget and timeframe that Slightly Mad Studios (SMS) set for themselves. As is the norm within the gaming industry and a lot of big projects there have been a few delays, but the developers have followed through with their vision of the game and did not rush it out for a quick buck. The game was funded through their own World of Mass Development (WMD) crowd funding system, where the each member of the community could purchase a tool pack to gain access to the game and the rewards scaled with each tool pack level, up until the required funding was reached (similar to Kickstarter, but a portion of the profits will be paid back to the tool pack holders). This game is not a one off, SMS want this to become a new racing franchise which pushes the envelope on what is possible in the racing genre and video games in general [Note: There will not be annual releases of the same game and they will not immediately drop support of the latest game, each game will improve on the previous one and be supported after release].The ""CARS"" part of the name stands for ""Community Assisted Racing Simulator"" and the original backers of the game (about 80,000 in total) have spent the past three and a half years providing feedback, suggestions and bug reports which have led us to this point. SMS also received the assistance of several professional race drivers (e.g. Ben ""The Stig"" Collins, Oliver ""Oli"" Web and Nicholas Hamilton, brother of Lewis Hamilton) to further make the game as authentic and close to real life as possible. There were also other drivers which got involved in the project in an unofficial capacity and used it to help prepare themselves for races (e.g. René Rast).Project CARS is focused on racing and whilst some people will complain about the lack of cars, when compared to other racing games, it does have one the largest number of tracks in recent history and that is much more important in my opinion. The other complaint is that certain cars and manufacturers are missing, but the reality is that some licenses are exclusive to certain companies (e.g. Porche, but Ruf is included) and others are just too expensive for the budget, cannot be justified or do not fit in the game (e.g. Ferrari and Lamborghini) . There are also no road cars, with a few exceptions which have the racing trim and setup, because this is a racing game and those kinds of cars are not seen in professional motorsport events or series. The focus of the game is spend time driving each car and learning the intricacies on how to eke out that extra couple of hundredths of a second from a lap or sector. This is not a game where you go around grinding for cash or points to unlock new cars which you will quickly move on from when you unlock the next one. Every car is unlocked from the get go, each one has been selected to fit into the featured racing series, modelled to match the real life counterpart and the performance that you see in game is as close to the real thing as possible.The campaign allows you to work your way up from the bottom (karts) and reach the pinnacle of motorsport racing (F1 or LMP), but there is also nothing stopping you jumping in at any of the levels because you get full control over your racing career and each play through can be different. There is also the Driver Network and multiplayer portions of the game, which allow you to compete against others and get involved in the community events.It would be a lie if I said that everything is perfect, there are a few bugs (not game breaking) and features which did not make it into the game for launch, but those should be added later on and the bugs will be squashed. The most important thing is that SMS have set the bar very high and this is a great thing for every fan of racing games, because the competition are going to have to work hard to match this.There are ultra settings and the game is 12K capable, supports three monitors and supports VR headsets, so do not be unreasonable and expect to be able to max everything out on current hardware and not notice a significant drop in the frame rate. Even on lower settings the game looks great and you should take the time to find your optimal setup for the best performance.I am very thankful for SMS to allow myself and the rest of the WMD community to join them on this journey and I plan on participating in further projects in the future, but for now I will see you on the race track and possibly in future WMD projects.Head over to the official website for more information on the game, including the tracks and cars.[www.projectcarsgame.com]DISCLAIMER: As one of the WMD community funders of the game it should be no surprise that I have recommended this game and I will receive a very small portion of the profit from sales, so do not just take my word for it, you should have a look at all of the other positive reviews that the game is receiving. I cannot claim that I am not biased towards loving Project CARS, but I would also not be praising it if I truly did not believe in it. "

												Right now I can't recommend this game.GeneralLacks optimization and polishing (There's too many bugs for a full release game, including sound issues, illusory walls, crashes, etc..) Feels rushed. Like this bug I experienced a few hours ago, I was on first place but suddenly game says that ""I have to let the guy on second place pass me because blue flag"", first thing that crossed my mind was ""must be a bug"" but I turned on the HUD and oh my, somehow the game said that I didn't complete a single lap when I did nothing wrong from the very beginning.Dark souls easter egg? I doubt it:

PhysicsPhysics are a joke, I know is some kind of hybrid between arcade and sim, but it is an awful mix imo. Sometimes at the same turn you are on rails, others you are on ice for no reason whatsoever. And they tried to sell this game saying that literally ""Has the most advanced tires physics ever seen on a game""? I guess they have never played AC or iRacing before such overstatement.AIAI is made of psychos who have no issues crashing their cars with yours, but guess what, NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM while your car is a wreck and all you can do is retire or restart the race. Another one of its tricks is cut through grass to overtake you or never have the need of warm up their tires. I don't like passive AI in racing games at all but this, is too much. Here's a couple examples:

And this is what happens when AI gets crazy:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442804380 CareerCareer mode can get boring pretty fast, since there's no feeling of progression. You start with everything unlocked, you can even drive LMP1, the top class in this game, from the very first minute so it is up to the player to choose what to do, but imo it gets boring once you have to deal with the same issues mentioned before (Specially AI) over and over.GraphicsGraphics are great, because thats what this game is all about. Graphics, graphics and graphics although the game is poorly optimized so don't expect to run everything on ultra unless you have a beast. Although the game doesn't look as good as screenshots pre-release made us believe, not just that, but the cars are the only thing that looks great. Backgrounds look like ♥♥♥♥♥, and visual damage is utterly poor. Btw, AMD users stay away from this game, check the forums for more info. SoundGood, but again there's some issues like loosing engine sound or hear your engine working after you blow it up.MPServers are a danger zone, again full of crazy people with only one task, troll as hard as they can. Plus there's some severe lag issues.Conclusion Many praise this game, but I won't, not until they fix it and release a game worth full price. So others can praise its graphics all they want, but graphics aren't everything in a game. And so far imo this game is Shift 2.5. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix between arcade and ""simulation"". Seriously, stop this bs. Make an arcadish game (Like GT or Forza) or a sim (Like iRacing, AC, Rfactor, etc...) but not an awful mix like this one.Edit: AGAIN, If you own an AMD Vcard, forget about this game. Just pay a visit to the forums and you will find out what I mean.			"

												I like the core game and enjoy it however, while the main selling point of this game is the graphics they are so poorly optomized for AMD rigs that I do not feel I can recommend this game to anyone running AMD hardware. I feel the after paying $50 for the game discovering it is so poorly made is a disapointment. If this game is 75% off or they fix the poor optomization then I would recomend buying it.Update:After having tried the game on windows 10 it works much better so if you have windows 10 then ignore the stuff about poor optimization.

												Have to say I'm pretty disappointed in this game, as it currently stands. I do not feel that it lives up to the hype.First off, the graphics are hardly as great as all the review sites claim. In some ways, they are impressive. The lighting is the standout, once you get past the cliche stuff like post-processed lens flare. The car models are impressive too. Textures and landscape are passable. But, what kills the look of this game for me are two things: First, the terrible, terrible shadows. These look like what you'd expect from the 16-bit era. They are rendered in what looks like horribly low resolution and flicker like crazy. almost pixelating the track wherever they are cast. Even on 'ultra' setting. Just terrible. And SMAA antiliasing seems to make the shadows worse. Speaking of which -- then there's the aliasing. Sure, the game offers a whole bunch of anti-aliasing options. But none of them work very well. Even with MSAA 4x and SMAA at 'ultra', there are brutal jaggies everywhere. The only way I could reign this in was by cranking Nvidia DSR with smoothness filter at 50% and FXAA at 'high'. That would normally result in a blurry mess in most games, but this game is so over sharpened and aliased out of the box that you need to do this to get anything like a decent look. Overall, I don't get the big fuss over this game in the graphical department. It looks decent but nothing special in my opinion. I've run it maxed out in 1440p and on triple 1080p screens, downsampled from 4k, you name it... nothing has impressed me very much. (By contrast: another recent racing game, Dirt Rally, currently in early access, looks to my eye WAY, WAY, better. That game has excellent anti-aliasing, excellent shadows and ambient occlusion, and at least as nice textures and models. No comparison, in my view.)Speaking of triple screens, the game currently has no independent rendering, so you have to set a high FOV and keep your monitors in a straight line. That alone should be a strong signal this is not a very serious racing game, despite whatever the marketing fluf would claim.Then there's the racing. The dealbreaker for me here is that the AI in this game is infuriating. If you play at the easier difficulty levels, it's a cakewalk to leave them in the dust. But as soon as you crank up the difficulty, not only do they get faster (which is good) but they get excessively aggressive -- so the game becomes a demolition derby.  Earlier today I tried TWENTY TIMES to get through the first corner in an open wheeled race. I ended up rage quitting. The AI cars ram into you and each other like suicidal morons, so you can't get started without getting rammed and spun out, very likely suffering 'suspension damage' that renders your car undrivable. I tried a bunch of different race setups and the result is nearly always the same. Set the difficulty at 80% or higher, and most of the AI cars will be missing bodywork 10 seconds into the race, and the only way to avoid their mayhem is to hang back behind them all. This is so stupidly unrealistic and game-breaking, it'd be hilarious if I hadn't dropped a good chunk of cash on this.So, overall, we have decent but way overhyped graphics and racing crippled by terrible AI. My recommendation is to pass over this game, at least for now. I bought into the hype train on this one, don't make the same mistake.EDIT AS OF PATCH 2.0: This latest patch seems to have achieved some improvement to AI aggression. I no longer experience as consistently infuriating a melee off the line and into the first corner with high difficulty levels. However, that isn't to say the AI cars won't still ram you from behind, sideswipe you while cornering, etc. They still seem to drive like they're blind, drunk and senile pretty frequently. And it's frustrating when this happens halfway through the race, when some AI driver comes out of the pits and decides to ram you. This may actually be even more annoying than the demolition derby off the starting line. Also, the main AI avoidance mechanism now seems to be driving off into the grass and the gravel traps. Which is a bit comical because they seem to magically drive at full speed over these surfaces and rejoin the asphalt at race pace. I often look in my rearview and see AI cars driving at full clip all over the grass as they struggle to avoid each other. By contrast, you will slow to a crawl and struggle to control your car if you hit the gravel. I've also noticed the AI drivers cutting corners, while you will get a 'warning from the race director' if you do so. These warnings, by the way, seem overly sensitive with this new patch. This adds to the frustration when an AI car sideswipes you, forcing you to put a wheel on the grass, and the game announces you've 'cut the corner' and will be penalized.I've also experienced some frustrating new bugs and crashes. A standout was when I had run a great qualifying lap and wanted to skip to the beginning of the race. I was treated instead to an infinite loading screen. I had to end task, lose my time, and start again. Checking the forums I saw numerous others are having the same problem.I still have mixed feelings about the graphics. I guess if you have a high tolerance for aliasing and other temporal artifacts (I've noticed lately that the game also seems to have texture fighting issues, with distant objects flashing), and enjoy post-processed lighting effects, this will impress. But that is not my preference, and it is still my opinion that this game's graphics are overhyped. Overall, there is some improvement evident with Patch 2.0, but not enough to edge this out of the thumbs-down zone for me. The frustration is still overwhelming the fun. The game still feels far from a polished product. Maybe someday this will be a great game, but it isn't yet.			"

												Update:The game is now playable with gamepad. Quite a few people were interested in this aspect so will put this update up top.The rest of the game has improved but is still a mixed bag. To be blunt the early access DiRT Rally is a more consistent and polished product than the current version of pCARS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well here we are finally project cars is erm finished? Complete? Er let’s just say its ‘released’!Considering where the build was years ago I had hoped, dreamed, and even reasonably expected more. Somehow I think by trying to do absolutely everything pCARS has it all but none of it is really 100% sadly.Don’t get me wrong pCARS is great. If I could, this review wouldn’t be a thumbs up or down but a wavering in-between. There just really needs to be a critique of pCARS other than the overflowing WMD love fest currently on steam. Take with a grain of salt the reviews of those personally involved with the development of this game. We all stand to possibly gain financially from its success to boot. Although the details are very very murky. Perhaps my negative review will mean my financial reward is lost? We’ll see :) Would you trust the cast of a movie to honestly review a movie on release? Of course not… what about the crew? Well if they all have royalty options and are hardcore fans dedicated and have been working for free the past few years? Up to you. I see pCARS as the first racing sim to have a hardcore fan base with plenty of ‘fanboys’ preloaded before release!If you have 20 minutes spare this video captures my point exactly:

			I'm going to link an article here below. But first, let me just say this - I don't particularly care for the person behind the site, I don't care for the way he does things, the way it occasionally...		

PROS:-VarietyHeaps of cars for all tastes! Open wheelers, road cars and everything else!Lots of tracks and configurations.What a variety of conditions. Want to run a 24 hour race around Bathurst with everything from thunderstorms to clear sky’s go for it!-VisualsAmazing screen shots. You’ve seen them!The car models are stunning.Great cockpits with all moving parts (via g-forces too) bells and whistles.-Large grids. Depending on the track run 40 cars. (this has been unstable for me in the past)-Built by the community.Despite my problems with the rabid variety of fan boy any developer that listens and reacts is doing good in my book.CONS:-VarietyBy giving you everything and the kitchen sink (thank god rallying was dropped!!) SMS have bitten off more than they could chew in my opinion. Few cars or tracks feel 100% polished at this stage.Pushing the limits of number of AI and conditions still results in occasional crashes for me.-VisualsThey don’t live up to the screen shots!At the beginning of development my PC was woefully under spec. I could tour around in some builds hot lapping by myself waiting for the day I got a beast and it would look like the screen shots.I got my i7 with SSD and 16gig of ram gtx 970 and I can get over 100FPS with a full field in the rain but it doesn’t look at all like the screen shots out there. Some talented community members have worked magic with the photo mode and post processing on videos.-Starts in background.The game has never ever, on 2 different PC’s I’ve owned, started as the foreground window. It starts goes into the task bar and there I can click or alt-tab all I want, it stays until I kill the process… The only way I can play is from the quick launch right clicking steam. If it’s been a while since playing I have to start it then kill it and quick launch. This was raised and talked about forever on WMD, how on earth is it still not fixed? Don’t have any trouble with any other game at all!-Terrible gamepad support.Yes I can hear them now why use a gamepad it’s a SIM etc. Short answer I have too. My back is stuffed. I have all the gear I want it’s no good if I can’t use it. Anyway I have learnt to get around in other SIMS with my Xbox one PC controller. It’s not easy but I get around in iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, Race Room Racing Experience and many other sims with the gamepad. Race Room Racing Experience in my experience setting the bar for how a sim should support gamepad. I really can’t understand it I used to enjoy NFS shift as an in-between serious racing game for some fun. It had terrible wheel support with massive dead zones and was only really playable with the gamepad. So now the same developers have gone and created a game that is completely unplayable with the gamepad but now works great with the wheel? Why why why?-AIThe AI has improved a lot in the final build. But then it had too! In this final build the AI displays less of its psychotic death wish driving style, actually respecting the track boundaries and your car for the most. However it is not possible to run a race without finding corner tyres and witches hats strewn everywhere after the first few laps. Being on a qualifying lap then slamming into a corner tire thrown onto the racing line and losing your lap time because of contact brings the kind of joy known only previously by the gran turismo special mission races. Don’t touch anything or you fail. AI rams you… oh joy! Why do all modern sims have such poor over aggressive AI? rFactor 2 is the only modern sim that will give you anything like the sort of behaviour you would see at a professional race weekend as opposed to the open multiplayer full of kids experience todays AI seems to replicate!-PhysicsWMD members get excited by the SETA tire model. It dynamically simulates aspects of the tire model that other sims use static graphs and data to simulate. In theory tires should heat up, cool down, wear out, flex and a whole lot of subtle things more realistically. In practice I don’t think it’s finished yet. A tire model is a hell of a thing to develop. Clever people have been at it for decades building upon previous work done. Is this dynamic model a step toward the future. Yes. Does it right now give you the best, most consistently matching real life data model out there today. Nope. In a word the physics feel 'floaty'...And this pretty much sums up pCARS right now. The potential is huge. Bigger than anything before. But there simply wasn’t enough time to finish every part of the game to the level it deserves. I would have gladly had less cars, less track, less dynamic models to have GT cars with the weather all at a 100% finished level polished like all hell, than a bit of everything that doesn’t quite feel right a lot of the time. I would say if your using a gamepad wait, if you’re not really into your racing sims wait. If you have a wheel and enjoy a wide variety of different racing sims that all have different pros and cons then no doubt this purchase is a no brainer! Just don’t expect the holy grail of sims that some claim it to be and you won’t be disappointed. I’m hoping they finish this off it really could be brilliant. But having heard pCARS 2 already mentioned I’m not sure this sim will ever get the polish it needs.			"

best AI ever 
A Screenshot of Project CARS

Pros:- quantity of content- physics for most of the race cars- decent track modelling for being non-laserscannedCons:- physics for most of the street cars- strange design decisions in regards to the AI aggressiveness and career skill- odd bugs- the WMD communityI've put enough hours into this to feel I've justified my purchase, but I leave the game feeling like I've accomplished little of what I had hoped to get out of it.  Going into PCars, I was hoping for a light sim with drivable if not phenomenal physics and track modelling, tons of qualilty content, a solid career mode, and top-notch artificial intelligence.The physics for most of the race cars actually managed to exceed my expectations.  The Prototypes, GT Cars, and modern Open Wheelers in particular are generally fun to drive and behave more or less in the manner you would expect.  Most of the street cars, on the other hand, would be unsellable if they handled as poorly as they do in this sim.    There are also the odd gMotor-like physics issues with regards to how the cars interact with the track surface, as occasionally what should be minor undulations will actually cause tires to lose contact with the track entirely, as if the suspension isn't doing its job properly.  Additionally, some cars have very little grip when the tires are outside of their optimal temperature range, where in reality you would expect slightly less grip but for the tires to otherwise maintain their usual slip characteristics.The tracks are also surprisingly well modelled considering that, AFAIK, laser-scanning was not used to create them.  Having driven many of these tracks in iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I was impressed with how close they are represented here.  With that said, elevation and camber changes seem to have gotten the worst of it, but overall the tracks are functional and don't take me out of the experience.The career mode is almost insultingly barebones.  I am absolutely in love with the idea of basing it on a real motorsports career, where you can choose a starting level and work your way up and down the disciplines appropriately.  What I'm not in love with is the hightly repetitive nature of the social media aspects, where the same handful of headlines, emails and fake twitter posts are repeated based on your performance in the most recent race.What I'm also not in love with, in regards to the career, is how the AI difficulty is automatically scaled downwards based on which tier you are racing in.  I understand that they're trying to simulate the level of talent increasing as you progress higher through your career, but the differences should be based on the density of talent rather than a change to the overall difficulty slider.  This is something that I think Dirt Rally does well - the top times are always in the same ballpark, but the overall skill of the field tightens up as you move through your DR career.  Whether you're racing in karts or the LMP series (which is, laughably, placed higher than F1 in the career tree), the top drivers should be similarly skilled.  The difference should be that the LMP series would have more of those top drivers than the lower tiers.Speaking of AI, the AI is super aggressive.  I like that they attempt to defend and gain positions, but the ""red mist"" that has apparently been implemented has got to go.  It is routine to see cars, after being passed, immediately cut the next corner or run wide on the exit, even if doing so means driving directly into another car or a physical barrier.  Addtionally, the lines they take at times are shockingly bad.  Braking too late into corners and then getting on the throttle far too late, causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight.  Cutting corners or exiting wide, again causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight.  The AI in this game basically drives like first-time online racers, with no situational awareness and no understanding of the importance of early throttle application on corner exit.I feel like, despite not recommending this title, there are quite a few positives to be had.  However the poor career mode and AI really make the overall experience pointless, as there are far better sims out there for online play or hotlapping.  As of this time I cannot recommend the title, but I do plan on revisiting it in the future when it has been patched further and more content has been released.			"

This is frustrating along with the fact that you can't skip the intro logos (in game or by manipulating files) which feel like they go on longer than they should. This makes adjusting video settings or just doing basic things like windowed/fullscreen a chore and take much longer than necessary. You also cannot change any settings while in a race, which is also annoying. Not even adjust controller options like deadzone or sensitivity. That means that when you're trying to correct the frustrating handling (more on that in a bit) you need to continuously load in and out of races. Over. And over.Also there is no borderless fullscreen mode.But those are mainly minor annoyances in the grand scheme of things. The big issue that I've found is the handling. I play with the stability and traction control on and all. All penalties, damage models, tyre wear, gas, etc are all off (This also means that I do not have tyre temperature simulation on). I cannot keep a car on the track even if my life depended on it. Oversteer and understeer are extremely common. You can slow down to 20 - 30mph to take a 90 degree corner in clear bright weather conditions and you will either drive straight into the gravel or have your car start spinning as if it was caught in a tornado. You can also completely lose your traction on straightaways and head face first into the barriers due to bumps in the road, the AI drivers, or the game deciding that you're not miserable enough. Correcting spin-outs feels practically impossible because as soon as you start to spin out, your car will feel like it is on solid ice. This felt the same from karts to street cars to touring cars. Nothing felt stable. Even after adjusting controller settings to the ones found on a very popular guide from the Steam community, it felt a little better but still completely uncontrollable. I've heard that this game feels much better with a wheel. With a 360 controller however, it felt like a nightmare.I'd also like to comment on the community for this game that I've seen while trying to troubleshoot many problems. The community is very very defensive about this game and is very quick to point fingers at anyone and everyone rather than admit that the game has problems that need to be fixed. For example, I noticed that if you so much as scrape a wall with your front bumper, your entire side of the car will snap to the wall and be impossible to steer away from, as if the wall had a magnet that sucked you in. After googling the problem, I found many people in the community eager to dismiss it as realism and that the player was just playing badly. Cars do not stick to walls. This is also true for people that have issues with the handling. They are at fault because they play badly, not because the game has an inconsistent and hard to grasp handling model.I was very very excited to finally play this now that it is in the Humble Bundle after reading much about it and watching many videos etc etc. I ignored all the problems people said it had and now I wish that I had listened.I'd love to recommend this in the future if its problems get sorted, but for now I'd suggest that you pass if you're on the fence.If you're gonna get it anyway, that's great! I hope that you can get to grips with the handling better than I could and have a fun time.Edit: I feel like it would only be fair to briefly touch on the AI too. It is not good. You know how when you play something like Gran Turismo, you use the other cars as buffers around corners and shunt them around because there is no penalty not to? That is what the AI does to you. Around corners, the AI will frequently shunt you off the track even though you've given adequate space for themselves and for you. I have also experienced the AI swerving into me countless times while I'm overtaking them on a long straightaway. Because of the penalties system, if the AI shunts you into a wall, your lap time is invalidated. If the AI shunts you across a corner, you cut the track and your lap time is invalidated. It is an extremely frustrating experience dealing with the AI.Edit 2: Also sometimes when you tab out the window turns completely white. It still is running properly and hasn't crashed but is completely white and uninteractable, requiring a restart.			"

												Let me see, lets address whether I will be censored with an opinion on this review? erm no, goodLets get to it, the amount of poor support regarding this game is a joke, having major issues for people all over seems to be missed due to the amount of censoring done by DevsKnown fact amongst STEAM users and also else whereIf this is how SMS wants to treat its customers, then by all means don't think the same user base will be buying pC2Now to the game, lets just say I have played better on consoles fwiwJoypad support is non existant for user input here, sur eyou have a plethora of adjustments at hand, but why? none seem to give any smooth input making the game frustrating to say the leastWell all can't just buy wheels, which it seems this game is designed forI have 4 myself, but no where to use this as I have a 55 inch TV I use for the PC, so no deskHaving asked the forum reasons to why controller input has been over looked, a response of, ""we don't support 3rd party apps"" If this is the kind of support one is expected as a soruce of ""professionalism"", well I am sure this transparency to the real intentions of the Devs is seenQuite simply, they don't care about our needsI have pretty much played every car game out there, not all, but pretty much most of them, and this game by far even though it's eye candy plus, is lacking some serious support from SMS1.5 million games sold? most on consoles, they use a Joypad as a predominant device, yet PC seems to be over looked, why?The game has potential, which is met by the arrogance of the Devs and support staff, thinking thsi game is a Sim. It's far from, most things that go to make it a Sim is broke, too many issuesAI is seriously BIASED so it does as it pleases and is not confined to the rules of what you drive toOpponents go off track, over take you, you do the same, you get penalties and slow down, greatAll I can say is, a good looking game does not necessarily make a good playing gameEdit, proof of how customers get treatedhttp://oi60.tinypic.com/20b1pv6.jpgThis post has since been removedUpdate, looks like that pic has been removed so here it is againhttp://postimg.org/image/stmxy7iih/Edit 31/01/16I am adding that my review has been hidden, for what ever reason, I don't know, but it just goes to show how the devs censor anything but a positive reviewEDIT, I have to add this, this is a moderators msg to me to why I was banned, and since I have already spoken to a Global, it wasn't a STEAM mod, but SMS Leviathon who did thishttp://s13.postimg.org/bydqbih87/p_CMr_Wii_JPG.jpgNow since this is specifically a friend of mine I was speaking to, hence the sledging, I don't see how any of the reasons apply to why I was banned, particularly since I had already deleted the comment myselfThis ISN'T about me being banned, this is about how SMS employees treat their customers, ergo my reviewUnfortunate as it is, but I doubt many people 2nd time round will invest in pC2, given that we were promised a DX12 upgrade, looks like that's not coming either...

												If you like racing games this HAS to be in your collection.  One of the best racing sims on PC.  The handling of the cars has a great feel with each one having there own characteristics.  Your able to feel tyre wear as it slowly drops away and if you leave the pits on cold tyres and expect to go flat out, you'll quickly find yourself in the barrier.  The weather not only looks great but adds alot to the racing as the track evolves from dry to wet.The career mode is great for those who enjoy single player racing as you progress up the ranks into the higher formulas while also getting the chance to gain invites to special race series throughout the race calender.For the graphics, the videos and pictures say it all. Sounds are great also.There were still a few small bugs in the last build before release but watching how quickly things have developed over the last 3 years it won't be long, if there are any still, to be squished.If things start to feel a bit too easy, try out the Lotus 98T on full boost round the ring in a thunderstorm! :D			"

												Unfinished, even at patch 1.4. The amount of game breaking bugs, unfinished features, poor ai, crap multi player and even worse AI make this game nothing more than a graphical showcase.  The developers have time to release paid DLC and work on features like advanced RAIN - fecking RAIN, rather than fix the broken game. STEER CLEAR if you want to enjoy racing - there are plenty to choose from on the PC.			"

I will be comparing this game to its main competitor, which is Assetto Corsa. (cant account for rfactor 2 because i dont own that game).Having played both games, I think they both upsides and downsides.Project Cars feels, to me, like a more complete game than Assetto Corsa.You have a proper progressive career mode where you start out as a racer and choose which league you want to start out in, you have proper multiplayer in which you can easily host your own lobbies without any port-forwarding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You have day/night time progression as well as various weather settings. You have complete control over each individual option in a race you create, whether it be assists, cars, AI/player count, practice session time, qualifying and the final race.Project Cars feels amazing with my G27 wheel.The graphics are the best of any sim racing game on the market today.Beautiful tracks, especially Azure Coast & California Highway.Okay, moving to the downsides of this game.-The physics are not the best in the genre by any means, a lot of oversteer and easily correctable which makes racing relatively *easy*, compared to Assetto Corsa where it is very biased on understeer which rewards you for proper driving.-The sounds are not realistic at all if you compare some cars to real life. It's as if every car's sounds are simulated with the car having 0 noise muffling even if it's a street car(Ford Mustang).-There are barely, if any, mods for this game so you're pretty much stuck with what you get + DLCs.-Speaking of DLCs, this game has many and are expensive for *barely* what you get.-The AI is incredibly horse ♥♥♥♥ and will always find a way to ram you, no matter how well(or bad) you drive. Move a bit to the right if an AI is overtaking you, and he will(for some reason) run into your ♥♥♥ and spin you out any way.ConclusionBoth games are good in their own way. It's all down to personal preference.Do you want a hotlapping simulator with the best physics in it's genre and modability?Or do you want a complete game with an amazing career mode, proper multiplayer and incredible visuals?

												I have held competition licenses for many years now, and I can tell you that this is so far off from a sim that it is laughable. Most reviews of this game come from people playing a controller. In it's own right I understand that not everyone will have a high end racing wheel to use. However, any real sim should be tested and reviewed at minimum with a controller and a wheel.First things first, I am not some crazy over the top fanboy. This game looks great. The interface is smooth, and has a very nice layout. The graphics put it in a league of its own. There are lots of little things that this game gets right that a lot of other racing games and sims alike seem to really muck up. This is one of the first games that I have played that did not immediately lock up the rear wheels when pulling the hand brake. On the subject of Brakes, this has a loose idea of something called Brake fade. The hotter the rotors get, the more distance the car will need to stop or slow down. The engine temp will rise and fall depending on ambient temperature, Driving style, clean air V.S. Drafting. It has a lot of small things done very well. It is one of the few where you can toggle the lights and see the effect on the environment. The different camera angles are spot on. There are true elements the devs wanted this game to be a sim.I want to like Project CARS. I really do, but I can't. This is not a sim. It is a game. Had it been marketed more as a game I would have loved it. In fact in early development it was. It changed rather abruptly near launch however. It became the ""Ultimate Driver Journey"" and ""For Racers by Racers."" None of the actual racers I know whether it is SCCA cone chasers or Rally America drivers had many things that we said put into this game. The end product actually turned out to be something some of us downright hated. The physics are buggy, sometimes you fall through the track, sometimes the car has more grip than it would on rails, other times it is like driving on ice. Collisions are far from sim level. You might be asking, "" Isn't the point of a sim not to crash?"" Absolutely, however mistakes happen on the track. It is a reality of the sport that drivers have to accept every time tires touch the track. This game has nearly no consequences for mistakes large or small. Hit a rumble strip too hard, nothing will happen. Bump a player or AI. Mild scratches. Really hit them, body damage and mild alignment failure. It seems really upsetting that games or sims in this genre really seem to ignore player punishment. The odd thing of it all is that is what players want. We want the aggravated feeling of throwing away the whole race over a miscalculation leading us to rip an oil pan off and blow an engine; Or the feeling of unspeakable pride when we finally master a track. I know that there are going to be bugs in a game like this. I am sure things like that lack of Force Feedback, or awkward dead-zones will eventually be fixed. There isn't a game out there that is trying to achieve this level of detail that wont have a few things to work out. I understand that, but there was so much potential that was just thrown away. It was like a sim that didn't know it wanted to be a sim. Driving feels disconnected and not very authentic. Project CARS is a good game, but just that. If you are a hard core racing sim seeker I would go into this game with the idea that it is not a sim. It is a fun and somewhat challenging racing game, but it will not meet all of your needs as a hardcore driving sim fan. In total I will give Project CARS a 77/100. The beautiful graphics and amazing attention to detail make this game stand out, but I can not forgive the vague sense of driving or the important bits that Slightly Mad Studios Gave up on. With that I can not recommend this Sim as a sim. It gets an ""Eh maybe"" as a game.			"

												Have an AMD card? Then you are ♥♥♥♥ed! The devs are in bed with nvidia, and have screwed over player with non-nvidia cards. SMS has downgraded AMD performance.(Also, force feedback seems to be also sub-par, or do my memories trick me in that regard?)Exhibit a: all tracks are awash with nvidia ads. Either SMS have an idiotic sense of finances and were duped into including nvidia ads in their game for free, or they are lying through their teeth. As their successful financing of the game hints at good sense of money, I'm sorry to say the latter one is the more sensible of the two options. (Or they are rabid nvidia fanboys who plaster everything with nvidia logos. Which would be even worse.)Exhibit b: while a couple hundred builds back, AMD cards were working fine, now surprisingly they are simply not utilized. GPU usage is far from 100%, with the same driver as before.This is from October of 2014, build 829: http://i.imgur.com/867VGbX.pngAnd this is from now, build 1000+: http://i.imgur.com/Fcm4FSO.pngThe difference is that the first lets you go mostly ultra on a 290X, while with the second, you can't even use high settings for the same framerates.

												1) the ""mixed"" reviews are coming from people who are expecting this game to behave like need for speed. This is a simulation. Your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ xbox controller will not give you the control required to play this game on it's maximum difficulty. 2) The AI ""smashing into you"" And players ""smashing into you"" is YOUR fault. Learn what an apex is, and follow it. Learn your racing line and don't act like you own the road. Would you drive like this in a real car with your life and the life of others in your hands? No! Don't do it! They're hitting you because you're bad at racing. This game's physics isn't for casuals. Practice, practice, practice. Everyone says they want ""the most realistic driving simulation possible"". Slightly Mad gives it to you and the crybabies realize that they actually didn't want that. They want to feel like a racecar driver without realizing it takes actual skill. Go play need for speed. This is the single most incredible racing experence you can have in VR, if you have a proper racing wheel, and you want something that is a little forgiving and looks fantastic.It translates to real track time improvements, I feel, as long as you set the game to the hardest, full manual difficulty. The simulation is not 100% ... but it's damn close. It can be somewhat forgiving when it comes to damage or vehicle on vehicle impacts and so on - but the driving and road physics are top notch. If you don't drive like a lunatic and keep it on the track, the behavior is incredibly close to a real car.As someone who has raced in road course time attack in a real racecar, this is the closest you're going to ever get without splashing 20k on a racecar and making it your life: or getting a full motion sim rig and going all in on iracing.

												I'm only 5+ hours into the game, and I really like it. I own Forza for XBox One and GT6 for PS3 so the first thing that stands out are the graphics on the PC... Wow! The loves.. I love that when you are racing in any city, that you feel like you are there.. the buildings in the distance are as detialed as the race track, the smog, the amazing weather affects.. as it starts to rain, it is on your windshield but not on the track, as it continues, you can see the rain puddle as the track stops absorbing it! And the sunset hitting the clouds as the rain stops.. Wow again.The likes.. I like that there are 7 views possible for racing: bumper, hood, left/mid/right driver view, windshield, and above behind. I like that the controller is very responsive.. I haven't tried my G27 with it yet. And I like that it feels as though it has a lot of potential..The dislikes.. Where are the cars? There are 74ish cars. And I'm sure that there are lots more coming.. but that's just it.. it doesn't seem finished. From the menus, to the woman explaining each part, it doesn't feel as polished as the actual racing. I couldn't figure out how to quit the game! Why would I want to? The cars come fully modified. Meaning there is nothing to buy. But you can fine tune every detail from +/- .1% toe in angle, to shock height etc. But don't take too long cause the practice, or qualifier timer is still running.. and you want to qualify for one of the top 4 spots or forget it. When I have started in 16th I have usually ended up in 16th.So to sum up. If you want a racing game that is exceptionally detailed visually, has great car control (for the cars it has), and has a lot of potential. This is it.			"

												UPDATE 5/6/2016I find it amazing that people somehow focus on only 1 of the 25 points I made in the review and assume I hate this game merely because it's not on Wii U. Moved original review UP for people who can't read.Having over 100 hours in this game now. In many parts it feels good, but there are many things that are constantly annoying, and after I think 7 patches so far the problems are still there.Pros I can think of:Look better than most other sims, day/night transition and weather look goodA career mode which keeps you busyA decent number of players onlineMany cars are good to drive and makes more sense than most arcade titlesProblems I can think of:Twtichy graphics. Flickering textures here and there no matter what settings I use. Reflections and special effects often look fake.Despite most people's praise, the game looks bad in many aspects, such as night. It looks way worse than say the new NFS. Also you can try driving behind a Mustang at night with you head light turns on. The Mustang's rear will look really bad. Same with many other cars. In addition, Azure coast and California highway don't look quite good as those screenshots.You need to turn track detail settings to high in order to see graffiti on Nordschleife, which means they don't regard graffiti as reference points but as decoration.In-car camera way too dark. Feels very unrealistic. It looks like you have window tint on your windscreen.Online lobby is usually a big mess. Much bigger than sims that more heavily depends on dedicated server. Everybody makes a lobby with car/track they like, and many don't make much sense such as 5 lap race with mandatory pitstop, Formula A cars having track day with slow road cars, etc. There are lots of wreckers too.Many cars feel stiff, and their behavior sometimes doesn't make sense.AI is bad, they either can't drive themselves, or like to ram players, or are too pacifist and don't give chanllenge, depending on car classes they use. AI is particularly bad in Karts.They aren't affected by weather as much as players do, which is unfair and frustrating.Rolling start is broken. It often guarantees the 2nd place player gets to 1st when green, and there are a lot more bugs related to rolling start, which havn't been resolved since launch.Race start sequence is fixed. The timing from the last red to green is always the same.Track-cut detection is broken. People can still gain lots of advantage cutting the track without getting any penalty.Engine start is the most pathetic in all games that have this feature. Instant engine start with no sound at all.FFB feels too much spring, and the community relies on JackSpade guy's hard work to make FFB work, which should be the devs' job in the first place.Community events/Time trial leaderboards have problems. Record on Hockenheim GP is an SLS GT3 in less than 25 seconds. I bet it's faster than a jet fighter.Calendar in the career mode is poorly thought out. 24h Le Mans seems always in mid December which doesn't make sense. You can have multiple events on the same day at opposite side of the planet and feels very unrealistic.UI is made worse and worse. After the new update the option button and shutdown button on the top right corner are almost invisible. What were they thinking?No proper triple monitor support (graphics are stretched to side screens and UI is not designed to work best with 3 monitors), and the telemetry HUD is unusable on triple monitor, while other features kind of work on triple screen. This means when they first design the game, they never even think about triple screen setup, which is ridiculous since it's aiming at the sim racing community.There is no way to change any option at all when racing. You can't even adjust game's sound volume. To get a nice FOV or to find the best video settings, you have to go into and out of races back and forth constantly, and there is no automatic visual settings. There is also no way to check you button binding when you are in race.Many problems with physics. Rain is unrealistic. Contact between cars is broken (cars that make contact with stick to each other).As a Wii U owner, the developers' attitude towards the promised and then abandoned Wii U version and Nintendo supporters is ridiculous.DLCs, especially the Japanese car DLC, feel like lazy work and cash grab.It's a nice game but loaded with problems. I think a ""Postive"" rating should best describe how it is.You don't have to read the updates below at all.==============================================================UPDATE 3/27/2016Repsonse to that daddy do it right guy with a reply regarding the Wii U stuff. I assume this guy is a PCars fan, and I dislike his attitude towards my negative take on PCars Wii U release cancellation.1. Far back in 2012 SMS has confirmed a Wii U release. The Wii U logo appeared on their website, along with Steam OS version announced and confirmed. They did get a lot of funding from Wii U owners and supporters from their crowd funding campaign.2. Since the annoucement of PCars, SMS had been constantly asked about the Wii U's capability of handling such a racing sim as PCars, and SMS had been constantly saying PCars will come to Wii U. You can still access the presentation slides here: http://www.wmdportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/WMD_Overview_160212.pdfThey talk about utilizing Wii U's unique controls quite a bit.3. For people who don't own or like Wii U and believe I (along with many other Wii U owners) am ""gullible"", check that slide and see on page 22 how many promised features and aspects are left out from the game or are made into paid DLCs to milk gamers. You can even find videos of Indianapolis track from early builds of the game, but the official release left this out for no good reason.4. I'll list some quotes from SMS regarding the Wii U version of PCars, check what they said:Jan 7, 2014. http://gamingbolt.com/project-cars-will-showcase-the-hidden-power-of-the-wii-u-slightly-mad-studiosSep 5, 2014. http://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-cars-wii-u-delay-theres-no-conspiracy-dev-/1100-6422143/5. Even without a Wii U release, the PC version and console versions are full of bugs and issues. I personally will no longer support this developer. Me being gullible? No. It's this developer's attitude and expertise being far below my guess, and many others'.UPDATE 2/6/2016Reply to the ""if you don't want it just refund it"" comment:To begin with I pre-ordered this game because I wanted to support them bring the first ever racing sim to WiiU (but then they dropped it which is disappointing), and back then there was no such thing as Steam refund.Besides, current refund policy requires game time less than 2 hours, which in most cases will not do a fair review for racing sims. Most racing sims even need more than 2 hours to set up your controller and FOV correct. I have over 100 hours into PCars now, and I'm confident that my negative review on PCars much more fair and unbiased than other people's negative review, who only spend less than 2 hours in the game. Yes PCars for me should be more than 5/10, but due to the polarity of how Steam review works, if I'm asked ""Do you recommend PCars to people who wants a racing sim"" my answer would probably be no, hence my negative review.Also I just lost my about 80 hours career save when I change my hard drive. It seems that the save file is local and not cloud backed-up. Be careful when you reinstall the game.			"

												As a simracer I've been waiting for this game for a long time. When I plugged in my T500RS and did my first laps I was like: Wow, Need for Speed Underground is back? The force feedback gives you zero feel for the cars. It feels like playing Ship ""Simulator"". Don't get me wrong, this game will make a good 3rd person console gamepad title but srsly... not a sim. I'm Nürburgring Touristenfahrer and drive the ring about 4 laps a month. There are sims which simulate driving the ring pretty good on an accurate layout but not this one. Everything just feels totally wrong. Sadly I can't review the graphics because I'm only using an AMD R9 card and we all now that this game runs good only on nvidia cards. I had high hopes on this game because of all those Fanboys (that will dislike this review of course as you can see on every negative review here) around hyping it so much.Long story short.. You want a 3rd person console gamepad racer? Buy it. You want a Simulator? Don't buy it. "

												Im disappointed.Bought it during sale because it looked good and thought it would act like a really good  car game but sadly there are too many down sides to warrant it being such a high price and released game.Tires blow up after pit stopping which is mandatory but can be fixed by changing settigns which is a pest.AI cheats and takes pit stop on last lap meaning they get 22 seconds ahead of you and steal an unfair win.AI dont respect your car and they will not move from race line and this causes them to hit you and push you off.Penalties dont apply to AI but they do to you so if your pushed off by them they get away free but you penalised.Overall its a good game but really needs bug fixing instead of bring out more fancy cars.

												If you have an AMD card, stay away.This game does not work well with AMD cards.For now it's not recommended.Edit:This is my spec.Windows 8.1Intel i7 3770k quad core CPU (8 logical with HT), clocked at 4.2GHz.16GB RAMAMD R9 295X2 (2x8GB) GPUSSD 256 GB Storage.I've heard AMD are working on it together with the developer of the game, so hopefully it will be fixed soon. Also, not everyone with AMD cards seem to be having problems, looks like it could be the higher-end-cards, like 290 290x, 295x.I'm using the 15.4 AMD driver. I also disabled one of the 290x's in my setup, still not working well. So, it's not only an SLI problem. Check the forums, and benchmarks, at least some AMD cards are not doing well with this game so far.I tried disabling Hyper-threading and that actually helps, but it does not solve the performance issue.

												Ever dreamt of becoming a professional race driver? Racing insanely fast, exotic cars through extremely demanding speedways, facing fierce competition from other drivers and manufacturers, negotiating lucrative work and sponsorship agreements, while avoiding the paparazzi and guarding your private affairs like your life depended on it? If you do, then maybe we have something or other in common. The passion for racing and the curiosity about paddock and backstage affairs like contract negotiations, unveiling of new models, new driver and team entries and the occasional industrial espionage get people like me extremely excited for no apparent reason to the uninitiated or the frankly uninterested. And, while watching races from the TV can be really satisfying, having the opportunity to get in touch with the world of professional racing and experience the joys and pains of auto racing (even if through a computer simulation) brings such satisfaction to a whole new level.Project CARS (acronym for ""Community-Assisted Racing Simulator) brings the paddock to your home. Its deep, comprehensive Career Mode allows for progression not only through different racing disciplines (from go-karts to prototypes), but there also is an element of personal development in the game. The player has to manage one's inbox, where contract offers, event invitations and notices are sent, and keep track of scheduled races for a given period. There is also a Twitter-like ""social network"" system that allows the player to see the reaction from the fans and the media, something that adds a nice bit of off-track experience and helps to make things even more interesting. Many wins in a row may lead to invitational events, tests and even contract offers from other teams and promotions to other motorsport categories; the standard starting point of the career mode is go-kart racing, but there is the option of skipping some steps or even racing at the top level, Le Mans Prototypes. It sure does work differently than other simulation or ""simcade"" titles like Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport, whose ""simulation/world tour"" modes possess a more open structure, not being career and discipline progression-oriented like Project CARS; it really gives the sensation of being a real racer starting from the bottom, aiming at the top ranks of motor racing.Mind you, Project CARS is not a game for the uninitiated or the uninterested. It is, actually, a quite demanding racing simulator, having an intricate simulation model which tries (and generally succeeds) to replicate real-life vehicle behaviour. Much like Assetto Corsa and rFactor, PCARS requires accurate driving; cars behave and respond to inputs as they should, and that means that any driving mistake could send you to the pitwall in a matter of milliseconds, especially when driving faster cars like the Audio R8 V10 Plus or the Sauber-Mercedes C9. Effects like g-forces, weight transfer and body roll are reproduced, and the game gives out the sensation that the player is in control of a real automobile, especially when using a steering wheel like the Logitech G series wheels. Shaving off those precious tenths of a second from your lap times requires mastery of the use of the clutch pedal and the shifter, precise braking and absolute control of the gas pedal, in addition to learning how to set your car properly for each circuit. PCARS lets the player adjust every bit  of the vehicle - shock absorbers, ride height, transmission, aerodynamics and so on -, although the car settings are not as deep as what was offered by GTR2 or rFactor. Finding out the best setup for each car and track is extremely rewarding, and at the same time is a tough challenge. Real drivers Ben Collins (a.k.a. Top Gear's The (former) Stig), Nicholas Hamilton and Oliver Webb assisted during the development of the game.The learning curve is steep (as with any other simulation out there), and players are encouraged to take their time to learn each track and learn how to handle each vehicle, as each one of them responds very differently to inputs - as any real car would. A good idea is to start by driving the less powerful cars, like the Renault Clio and the Formula Junior cars, around easier tracks like Monza, and then progressing to harder tracks and more powerful cars, like the GT and Formula A vehicles. Fortunately though, there are plenty of driving aids like automatic clutch and gear shift, braking help and best line indicator, which could be very helpful for those interested in learning the ropes but not experienced with racing simulators.The car list, though not impressive like its rival titles, is enough to keep the player interested, and has got some real gems, like the Sauber C9 and the Lotus-Renault 97T once driven by Ayrton Senna and Elio de Angelis (although there are some important cars, in my opinion, that are missing, like the Nissan Skyline and the Honda NSX). But the track department is where this game shines: the game includes around one hundred different courses (some of these being separate sections of full courses), like the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza and the Circuit de la Sarthe (host of the 24 Heures du Mans), a knock-off of the Suzuka Circuit (aptly named Sakitto, ""circuit"" in Japanese language), as well as fictional locations.The graphics are marvelous. Every car is faithfully recreated from the headlamps to the steering wheel, and the environments are lush, rich with trees, roadside buildings and objects. Lighting and shadow effects are top-notch; the sunlight passing through the trees by sunset is definitely exquisite, and puddles of water scattered through the track after heavy rain (one of the most cosmetically appealing rain simulations I've ever seen, as a matter of fact) actually reflect their surroundings. Grass and particles are believable, and their level and quality can be adjusted by the player. When played at the maximum settings, although very CPU and GPU-consuming, Project CARS becomes a serious showcase; however, PCARS remains incredibly good-looking even at lower settings. The sensation of speed is so good it's really hard to describe - but it really makes the competition eat dust.Sound is also excellent. Apparently, engine sound was captured directly from the real thing, and hearing the engine roaring while cruising in a long straightaway like Monza's is exhilarating. Other sounds, like gearbox whirring, tires and brake discs screeching, suspension movement and crashes are very realistic and help in immersing the player in the experience of driving pure-bred racing cars on virtual circuits. Radio chatter is also available - the pit crew advises the player on any accidents during the race, or when to come into the pits, or any issues with the car.There is one flaw, though - AI. No, its not bad. Really. The computer-controlled racers shows believable responses to every racing situation and act sportsmanlike for most of the time... except when playing with AI levels above 85 - then, the carnage begins. Racers become almost suicidal, crashing  in spectacular fashion, messing up race starts in a way that even a total novice wouldn't (pile-ups and missing wheels are a rather frequent sighting) and wreaking havoc at every curve. Imagine yourself having an almost-perfect race, attacking every corner with surgical precision, leading the pack, heading to the checkered flag... only to be hurled off the track by a raging maniac. Frustrating enough? Well, at least you were not knocked out at the very beginning at the event.Multiplayer is excellent. All cars and tracks are available for selection, and the game sessions are, for most of the time, stable (depending on your connection speed and quality, that is). Like the single player mode, the host player can adjust the duration of the race (in laps or minutes), time of the day (continued in the comments section - character limit reached)			"

												After playing this game/sim in beta stages on a g25 and quite enjoying it, I thought it was an easy decision to buy the retail game.Initially I was impressed by the visuals and dynamic weather and time. My wheel had died in the interim and I was playing on a 360 controller.I got bored with the game after a few weeks and the controller was really ruining the experience for me. I left it for a month or so while I decided on a wheel purchase.Fast forward a month or two, I had ordered a Fanatec CSW V2 as I didn't have the money for the Accuforce and wasn't aware of the OSW (which I would have definitely gone with had I known).Fired up pcars in excitement. Turned a few laps. Felt rubbish. Worse than beta with g25. Tried changing settings. Still lacklustre. Tried the Jack Spade FFB tweaks, much better. Started an AI race offline. AI sideswipe me on first lap while passing on the straight. Try again. Same result. AI either has no spatial awareness or a death wish.It may just be that the novelty of all the pretty shiny effects has worn off, but I feel as though this game has maybe gotten worse since release. Version 3.0 FFS and the AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the control system and FFB seems to be continually skewing towards control pad users (why when it supposed to be a ""Sim"" I'll never know).Dissappointed in this game. It had so much potential. As much as people bag out AC for ♥♥♥♥ physics, at least I can run a race in that without the AI ramming me like a prepubescent teen raging in gran turismo when they get passed.			"

												Handling, physics and force feedback is not as good as Assetto Corsa.  Game runs terrible on every AMD card. Framerate goes to ♥♥♥♥ when a lot of smoke is generated, using AMD cards, because of the heavy Gamework title. It's fun, but its not the king of all racing sims.			"

												The disappointment of the last decade for me!project Cars was meant to be the ultimate simulation. The physics of rFactor2, the laserscanned Tracks of iRacing plus their great online community and partly realistic graphics. First apart from the graphics they reached none of their goals. They said real racing drivers helped them to develop the physics but i, as a guy who has driven a formula renault 2.0 car, can say that it is sh*t, so are the tracks the lack of details such as missing curbs or bumps that are actually implemented  in iRacing is huge. Another point is the AI well if they actually survive the first turn and you have a nice little battle with them they will divebomb and ramm you of the track at the first possibility. Do not judge me wrong i love it if the AI races hard but they have to be fair like in f1 2015. so i decided to do time trial but then again i realised that the physics are sh*t, the cars have way too much grip and are way too forgiving. For example you can brake almost 50 mtr. later than in real life but you just lock up and understeer of the racing line if you turn in but you do not spin and still get a decent line to overtake. So i think this game is even worse than the good old shift 2 in my opinion because we are 7 years on now and the Handling has not improved in the slightest only the graphics are good			"

												If they fix the ai... this game would be a lot of fun, but it is just too frustrating to race them. They have, for me, qualified 30 seconds faster than what should be possible with the car/track combination. Half the field (even ai) qualify with 1:30, while 10 or so cars are qualifying 1:02-1:01 at Outlon with the formula C car... Then when you try to race them it is just awful. They don't react to the terrain (such as gravel, which is like glue to you, the player, but the ai seem unaffected), they follow their terrible racing line whether you're trying to pass or not, they smash into you constantly, and they sometimes fly off the road at full speed into a chicane or hairpin (even on 100%). I'm not the fastest and 100% ai is pretty easy to beat on most car/track combinations. If the driving was amazing I might even look past it (I do for AC's ai woes) but the driving is pretty meh. Honestly, wait for a few patches and see where it's at. Stock Car Extreme is a far superior product, or even AC.			"

												Unfortunatly I can't recomend this title to anyone even at a low price. At the moment the game has way to many bugs, patches have created more. Updates will eventually fix this game but how long this will take is anyones guess. Only fit to be called early access.Multiplayer is almost unplayable with bugs like invisilbe cars to crash into. Penalties for jump starts when no jump start commited. No systems in place to reward or penalise drivers. Most of the time you are taken out by either a really bad driver or someone who just wants to crash and bash.Project Cars forums is also very little help as developers and backers don't like critasism and seem to shout down  bug reports and complaints (Disapointing)Hopefully in the future this game will work as advertised.

												This is my OWN EXPERIENCE with the game, good for you if the game is perfect to your standards.One word to describe this game: FrustratingFrustrating when you find out this game has a terrible progression system, specially because the same devs did Shift 2 that actually had a great progression system with credits and car tuning and customization.Frustrating when you are in the last lap and something goes wrong because of the game and its bugs.Frustrating that every bad thing that happens to you never feels that it was your fault, other ""simulators"" transmit this feeling way better and makes you improve, PCARS just makes your Rage meter go up.Frustrating when you need to research how to make the Force Feedback Wheel feel good tweaking the very complicated and confusing settings in EVERY car because the default FFB is terrible and you can't feel what the car is doing.Frustrating when they broke promises of features and starts ANOTHER crowdfunding caimpaing for PCARS 2 just a few weeks after the PCARS 1 release riddle with bugs.Frustrating to feel that the physics don't improve with new updates.Frustrating when you feel that there is something wrong with how aerodynamics works in this game.And frustrating because there is a ""Game of the Year Edition"" now, indication that they probably will drop further improvements to the game.I put hours and hours into the game hoping for this game to get a proper polish but enough.Bought into the hype, the hype let me down hard, you gotta give them credits, they know how to do marketing for this mediocre example of self-proclamed ""racing simulator"" game which is not.The only thing that could make this game good is the addition of a progress/customization system like in Shift 2 because besides the graphics, everything else it is just mediocre at best.

												Where to start with this game.Lets start with the maps. They are great! great detail and accurate to the minor details.The cars. Pretty damn good! They need to add some more packs soon so that there will be a more diverse car selection for you to choose from.The online. Pretty bad, need to sort out the de-sync issues ASAP and it's typicaly full of foreign kids screaming at you for cutting them up. Joining servers is a pain in the *** and sometimes leaving the pit lane in qualifying is a double pain in the ***.Now then, the physics... ABSOLUTE ****. If you love pushing through the pack of cars to get to second place and then just exposing a tiny tiny tiny amount of you wheel onto the grass and getting flung around and around, then this will be £30 well spent. The countless amount of times that i've battled to get 2nd and even 1st and then be thrown to last place because of shoddy physics which bug out when you tap grass is unbelievable... You  get stuck to cars when they come into contact with you, you can randomly spin out on a straight and if you dont have a rig thats above good then you will experience some lovely low frames and mysterious slow motion effects when you frames drop. All in all, unless you have a decent rig and a great tolerance to bugs and shoddy physics then i would wait untill they patch this game up with more than duct tape and a glue stick.			"

												The game sure is pretty - but for everything that you see in the menus, it's really just a fancy overlay on really basic races. No car customization, nothing to do in career mode except click to the next race, deep track list, but most (all?) not laser scanned which contributes to the lack of feel while driving.I thought I would buy Assetto Corsa as a holdover to this game, but it wasn't worth the wait. Assetto Corsa doesn't pretend to be all of the things that PCars says it is... but at least it delivers on the racing simulation.			"

												VR experience is AMAZING!!! I honestly can\'t believe it. I have had the game for a while but never really spent any time with it. Got an Oculus and thought I\'d give the VR version a whirl and I\'m sooooo glad I did. Project Cars in VR is the best simulated racing experience I have ever seen. The cockpit view finally feels spacious. I can look ahead as much as I want, glance to the side to make sure I am clear of the other vehicles. Other cars on the track feel real. They have size and mass, but at the same time, I feel like I have room on the course. VR changes everything.			"

												I learned about Project Cars some years ago and have waited for this game since then. I wanted to back it up but i was afraid to throw my money away because Slightly Mad Studios were behind NFS shift series, which i disliked. This time there's no EA behind the game, instead Namco Bandai published the game, it's not the best publisher out there, but they're definitely better than EA.This game is nothing like NFS shift (i so want just erase that „f“). Shift 2 was unplayable for me. I have tried it on PS3 and PC, on both platforms i had a huge 0,5 second input lag which made the game unplayable for me. I tried some fixes on PC, but it didn‘t help. Besides that there was almost no force feedback and the performance was not so great. Many people thought that Project cars will be Shift 3. But fortunately it‘s nothing like Shift, it‘s much MUCH better. It is one of the best racing simulators to this day. But of course it has flaws. It was released in a very bad state, almost unplayable if you play career mode. Patches coming very slow, SMS do not want to acknowledge bugs. Consoles are holding the patches too.I can‘t not compare pCars to Assetto corsa, i own both but i like pCars slightly more. The physics in pCars are no very good and ffb is worse. Nothing changed to this day. And what is even worse that AI is not affected by physics. Raining or not, physics laws doesn't apply for them.The graphics. This is probably the best looking racing game on the market. The graphics are stunning. Of course at some weather conditions it can look bland, but the same happens in real life. Unlike Assetto corsa pCars has weather conditions and full day/night cycle. Racing at night while raining is awesome. Rain effects are great, the game looks even better in the rain.Performance is not very good. It‘s playable, but i expected better performance with GTX970. It drops to 30-40fps which is not acceptable. But if you lower the graphics options it can run really good. There's slightly to no chance that the game will be optimized.pCars has great career mode unlike AC. And career is really long. You'll race every kind of vehicle, every kind of race etc. You get rewarded for winning and collecting all the rewards will take some time. Difficulty is easily adjustable so is race length.The car selection is varied but there are not many cars in the game. Yes quality over quantity, but we need more cars, let it be DLC cars (please give us real DLC, not ones which are already in the game and are created much earlier). I‘d love to see some more slower road cars, more muscle cars, Japanese brands. With such good sale they can afford much more licenses now, so if SMS will not waste the money we could see some nice cars. Sadly there's a problem with custom liveries. If you download one, it replaces the old one. What a nonsense. And the workshop was promised, it even has a section on steam discussion, but there's no workshop.Track selection is great. It lacks some tracks, but there is more than enough tracks. And it includes the famous Nordschleife, unlike AC were you need to pay 15€ for it. I guess more tracks will be added via DLC. I also hope for more point to point tracks. Yes AC has laser scanned tracks, pCars not, but not everyone is a maniac who notices this.I probably haven‘t seen a really good AI in a racing game. pCars is no exception. AI is pretty bad. But from the funny side it is very realistic because you often feel like racing against real people because AI rams you, cut corners and do other stupid things, same as real players. But if being serious, AI is bad. AI is not affected by rain so it‘s very hard to win in the rain, especially when it starts raining in the middle of the race AI keeps the same pace. This was one of the most reported bugs, but SMS did not fix this.The multiplayer is similar to other games. There are crashers all around who don‘t know what brakes are. There also are community events where you compete with others in the leaderboards. Similar to Gran turismo system where new events are added each week/month.The game is good, but it needs more work, more polish, to fix the bugs, add more features and make current features fully working. All in all i can recommend this game if you love racing games and have a steering wheel, love to drive/race, love to adapt to new cars, love to grasp the handling of each car which is completely different. It has it's flaws, especially the official forums, where you can't criticize the game, point out bugs, complain etc. Ian Bell the head of SMS can't communicate properly and even banning people who liked someones negative post. Besides many addressed issues were not fixed in patch 1.4. But how it can be fixed when reporting bugs on official forum can be a bannable offense. So the game is good, but it's not finished and buggy and it will probably stay that way forever. There's no support from SMS. After two months major bugs are not fixed. So i suggest wait at east half a year or even a year and get it for 75% off (it is not worth the full price), maybe the patch will be released which will fix the bugs...in a year or two.Pros:Great graphicsGreat soundNice career modeGood amount of tracksCons:Poor physics and tire modelPoor FFBLack of car varietyLack of updates and fixesIan Bell			"

												[Reviewed using a Logitech g27 set]A solid single-player racing game. The physics are really forgiving when compared to iRacing, but overall they are solid. The Career mode is good, and provides you with a lot of opportunities to drive all different kinds of cars while still giving you a ""season""-style experience. The emails and feedback you get from your racing directors are repetitive though... not sure why they are even there considering they say the exact same thing over and over again, to the letter.Major con against the game would be the trash AI. Open-wheel racing is near impossible due to the AI's desire to wreck you. In closed-wheel cars its less of an issue, but its a major frustration elsewhere. Also, the multiplayer is unpopulated and disappointing. If you want a good single player racing game, get Project Cars. If you want a competitive multiplayer racing game, get iRacing.			"

												I want to like this game.  I do like it, mostly.  The proble is that the controls don't feel realistic at all.  Not even close.  Even after pouring a good chunk of time into changing every concievable aspect most cars come off feeling like you are driving either a heavy truck or like you're driving on ice.  This game is totally unfinished and feels like a beta release.  the graphics are 7/10.  The driving physics are hit and miss but not even close for something claiming to be a sim, so 5/10. The AI is garbage and on rails.  I'm not great, by any means, but I know smart AI drivers when I see them and this ain't it.  I bought this thinking there might be some support for it but it turns out they are already looking to PCars 2.  Ah well.  I'd say it's worth $15, not the $30 I spent.  Even on sale, this game feels like it's asking too much.  I appreciate the attempt, but the excecution falls WAY short of what is now industry standard.  I'm not new to driving sims or arcades titles and this is neither one.Edit:  Something else to mention is the disappointing lack of customization and small car roster.  VERY small overall roster of vehicle brands given the deep field of vehicle brands in the racing community.			"

												It's probably the best mix of simulation & tracks & cars that is currently out there, in my opinion. The force feedback and the handling are lacking compared to Assetto Corsa, but the vehicle range and track range I would say compensates for that. Then again, Project Cars 1 development and DLCs might be finished, the way I see it, while Assetto Corsa continues to bring new content.Sometimes it can be glitchy, and usually a patch fixes one bug and introduces another. That's quite annoying. Nevertheless, a nice experience, and a pleasure for me to drive, especially in online multiplayer. I remember trying career at some point, but I found it incredibly boring and never touched it since.			"

GT4 AI Race 100%, starting last, thunderstorm, rain, foghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfxSYh9ABYQFord Escort Mk1 banger race, AI 100%https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVMiG2Qz1ysLotus 98T 97% turbo Time Trialhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rePGdCcAHEAFormula C Time Trialhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Meq4R2NTsEMSo you can compare, here are videos in rF2 and AC:rFactor 2 (AI 100%):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwFr9dfHmBkAC (AI 100%):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J_t29EsO44Well, I hate to say this but pCars is nothing short of amazing.Why do I hate saying this?  Since 2012, I've been a huge fan of rFactor 2, probably spent more than 2000-3000 hrs on it since then.  I also have more than 600 hrs with Assetto Corsa, and I came back to rFactor 2, because AC is so shallow.  The visuals sure are better than rF2, but everything feels gimmicky.  Lots of canned effects, and after a while, the initial wow factor wear off very quickly.  If you like to race single player, than AC is pretty much only hotlapping, if you have any driving skills, the AI is very weak.So I like rFactor 2 AI a lot..  it feels very natural in most cases.  I have not been part of the alpha phase of pCars, since I learned about it, and the registration were closed.Knowing this was SMS, those who made Shift series, I expected something like it, but maybe more oriented toward sim.  I also expected the game to run far from the visuals I have seen in screenshots and video, since my rig is pretty modest:Phenom II X4 9658gb generic ramgtx 580 1.5gbAnd yet, the game runs silky smooth at native resolution of 1920x1080, with AA, track details ultra, grass ultra, most other settings high, reflection mid, and the game looks pretty good, miles better than I would have hoped.I started the game with more conservative settings, and bumped them up a few times, and this is what I'm running now.  I'm playing the game with a stock g27, and the feedback is nothing short of stellar.  It blows AC out of the water.  There are so many settings to tailor the game how you want it,  I've played with FFB settings, and managed to get feedback almost identical to AC, and with some different settings, feedback like rF2.   I'm now playing with something in between.  Feels very good.The UI is excellent, looks good, clean, but could use more usability refinement.  Going to options to adjust settings is too many clicks away.  The same when you run hotlaps.  We could have the leaderboard showing there, instead of having to go back to the menu, in leaderboard (and it doesnt remember the car you have selected, so you need to select the car you are running) and then you see where you stand.  But having the leaderboard integrated like this and the possibility to load up any ghosts from there is a huge feature, if you are like me, and like to improve your lap times by running time trials.  I play mostly single player.  Haven't tried multi-player yet, but I wouldn't expect much from public lobbies.So far, I'm nearing 2000km driven on the nordschleife exclusively, as I haven't tried any other tracks, and this one is brilliant.  After seeing this version, one might question if Kunos really laser scanned their nordschleife, since the elevation changes don't look proper after nordkhere, thru hatzenbach, and hocheichen.  This version seems to nail it on spot.One thing Kunos have done better tho, is the attention to details regarding the bushes, the fully modelled terrain (this seems to use a few layer of cardboard mountains) and curbs.  In this version, most higher curbs seems to have been lowered, and they don't quite have the shape they should.  They are made so you can run over most of them.  A little bummer, but it is indeed more interesting as you have more racing surface to use.   Also Kunos have dirtied the x bricks seen in the inside of the karussell and other locations, SMS did not.  Kunos also added 3d grass on the outside of those brick.. it looks nicer this way.  SMS x bricks looks brand new.Physics are what you would expect from a sim.  I haven't played with aids or anything, so I dunno how far from sim it can become if you don't play as I do, but in my book, it's a sim.  Pure sim.  It doesn't lack much options either.You can fine tune FOV for EVERY view, independantly, and there are more options for anything than you probably want.  If you are a console gamer, you will definately feel lost.  But play with a setting, and go back in game and see what it does.  If you use the helmet camera, there is quite a few options to set exactly how you want your view.  The car setups are as detailed as any sims would be.  The numbers used for setting might not be values in real life, such as downforce for wings, it's not in degree, but a fictive number.  But does it really matter for the targeted audience?  F1 drivers wont be traning professionally with this...  neither they are training with rF2, but instead rFactor pro..    but the game could probably be turned into a pro version to train pro drivers. So, if you are like me and have every sim there is, like rFactor 2, AC, BeamNG, WRS, GSCE, etc, then you have to give this one a try, specially if you are more into single player like I do.  The integrated leaderboard will keep you honing your skills as you defend your position in it.I haven't tried to race the AI much, but have done one race, and it seemed very good.  Might not be at rFactor 2 level, but it's probably the next best.  Well, with rF2, I'm also counting all gmotor engine based game... so that includes GSCE and more...  at least the recent ones... I'm not sure for rFactor 1 itself, would have to play it again.I'm delighted with pCars and I will be playing this for a long time to come I think. Good job SMS!			"

												Game looks great, graphics are top notch - however, the gameplay, AI is terrible. Worst of all, cars feel like they are driving on ice and you have to change the steering settings far too often. Its much harder to drive a car around a corner than it is in real life..and the excuse of ""its a fast race car"" actually cannot justify the slippery steering and inconsistent tyre movements of the car handling in the game. Career mode is really boring, and online play is lacking, it takes too long to find a good room. No option of automatic race/join.			"

												My hours played speak for themselves.I've been playing racing games for close on 30 years and I've never felt the immersion that I get from Project CARS. This game really makes you feel like you're in a car, in a race, with real weather and time of day.If you're really into racing games and have a wheel, then this game will not disappoint.However, if you try to drive like NFS or GT, then you're going to be punished.

												Edit: One year later, online is still woefully underdeveloped and the AI is no better. Poor effort, SMS.I've had a roller-coaster of a journey with this game, and it can be brilliant when it works. Right now, the terrible AI and MP issues are destroying the experience for me. Wait a few weeks for SMS to iron issues out. It's not worth £40 in its current state.			"

												If I ever make a let-down list, this game will be close to the top of it. I followed it's progress in the few months leading up to release and thought ""Wow, this game looks amazing. AND it's a racing sim. Perfect!""What I got (in my humble opinion) was neither amazing, nor a racing sim. Or perfect, for that matter.I started my first career with the first tier of karts, which I quickly learned was a huge mistake. The physics and handling models applied to them were so atrocious that I wanted to vomit. Not from motion-sickness or anyting, but because they were so bad. Yes, 125cc karts are lightweight and hug the road, but the handling was just way too unresponsive and twitchy with an xbox360 controller.After forcing myself to finish a season of the karts career, I decided to try one of the events in which I get to drive a proper road car. During qualifying, it started to rain heavily after about 2 laps and I had posted the 2nd fastest time while the track was still dry. After pitting and getting 'wet' tires put on my car, I noticed that the AI were consistently crushing my posted lap time even with racing slicks in a torrential downpour, sending me back to 13th place. Now, I'm no expert on tire physics, but I've seen enough F1 races to know you can't drive soft-compund racing slicks in the rain and expect to have the slightest bit of grip. I thought unfair AI advantages were something of old arcade racers like NFS and not new racing ""sims""? The handling was better with the cars but still not what i would call simulation-like.I cannot comment on the supposedly beautiful graphics because I'm running 2+ year-old laptop hardware,(Intel i7 @ 2.4ghz, 3.2ghz with turbo and NV GTX 765m graphics)but I would get sudden drops in FPS from 60 to about 45 that would last a few seconds while running medium-ish settings.The game does, however, have a large selection of tracks and a nice selection of cars from what i saw. A little more variety in some of the car classes would have been nice, though, like the open wheels.I was excited to pick this up on sale, but now I'm excited to hear back about a refund.UPDATE:Less than 2 days after requesting a refund, my request was approved even though I have well over 2 hours spent on the game.If you like your racing ""sims"" with a  side of twitchy, unresponsive, and inconsistent handling with terrible AI, then by all means, go for it.But if I were you, I'd wait this game out and see if they patch some of the issues that I've seen.

												Aaahh, Project C.A.R.S.I really do love this game, despite the 100% justified complaints and criticism it has garnered. Kart racing in this game has actually improved my IRL go-karting tremendously.I'm not exactly an experienced driver when it comes to racing wheels; I use a DF GT on my rig whenever time permits me to play PCars, but what I do play I enjoy thoroughly. The game could be considered sim-cade'ish, but its leaning towards sim' so yeah, but AC is probably a better choice for pure driving. Car selection in PCars however is the ♥♥♥♥ for racing oriented vehicles, street not so much (although DLCs are fixing that).My only criticism with AC (which I consider a better racer in terms of driving physics and such), and mostly the reason I prefer to play PCars over AC atm is the presentation and UI.AC's UI is IMHO garbage, it plain sucks. I use a 3K display monitor and the way the game is set up between the menus and the actual driving part is ""bleh"" to say the least because of windows scaling issues. It's not very user friendly is what I would say.PCars on the other hand is more welcoming, sort of.You can't really save multiple tuning setups for the same car so that's a gigantic PITA, and configuring my wheel took forever (I haven't played in a few months, some of my complaints may have been resolved, who knows).And it has to be said, the announcement of PCars2 shortly after release was a bit infuriating, but at least it doesn't exactly seem like they have stopped support for THIS game so we'll see how it goes.Multiplayer in this game is eh I guess, not really much in way of variety. I LOVE the track day pub sessions (which is primarily the only sessions I ever come across), lots of cars with both good and bad drivers behind them swerving around tracks like Francorchamps or the Dubai Autodrome (my two favourite courses), and of course the lovely Nordschleife ;)I'd give it a 7-8/10, game has a lot of good in it, but the bads do outweigh it. Definitely try it out if you're into racing sims, and ABSOLUTELY use a wheel.[/b] "

												A pretty game that is absolutely unfinished. Glitch after glitch after glitch. I don't even know if the AI lap times are real anymore. Sometimes coming into the pits to tune your car during practice ends in AI cars having turned laps 16 seconds faster than you! Game is not finished. Stay away!			"

												In this simcade racing game you spend less time battling the AI and track and more time battling bugs. Wanna play a realistic career? Damage is bugged. Wanna do an endurance race? Every single car will blow it's tires and be parked in the dirt by lap 8. Wanna listen to your crew chief? He'll tell you it's  raining heavy when it's clear as day. Wanna watch a replay with dynamic weather and time? Car lights and damage are bugged (and you can't watch the replay from the perspective of other cars). Like fancy particle effects? Bugged. Wanna race clean in a packed field? Sorry, you're a target and the other cars are missiles. Need to hear your tires to know exactly what's happening with your car? Tire volume is so low you can barely hear them.This game actually does a LOT right. The on track car count is out of this world, the graphics are great, it's well optimized on Nvidia cards (I've heard nightmares about AMD cards though), it has more options and tweakability than any racing game I've played.  But it gets so many things wrong I just can't recommend it right now.It's worth noting that similar to the Elder Scrolls games I'm having a TON of fun with the game when I'm able to look past the glaring issues. But too many of the issues really ruin the experience for me.[EDIT] I've been wanting to change this review to a thumbs up but since writing it two patches have come out and not only have none of my issues been fixed but I've discovered several repeatable bugs. One of which allows you to shift into first and drive off before the race has started leaving the pack in the dust. When such simple things like not being able to start driving before a race don't work the game is just not ready to be called ""released"".			"

												Project Cars certainly is a very controversial game without a doubt, but something that confuses me is that people who dislike the game never really justify their reasons or provide proof to the technical issues within this game.I am going to say straight up, I have grown up around plenty of racing games through the years (Project Gotham Racing, Forza 3/4, Rally Cross, V8 Supercars 2 etc.) and its clear that this is one of those games that really quite is timeless. To be honest it seems like Project cars has taken little bits of each racing game I have played and combined it into one mass production. PROS: The Graphics- Simply stunning, this has to be one of the most realistic games I have purchased in quite a while and certainly does impress (provided you have the specs to push it)The Gameplay- When it comes to racing, nothing is more important than playing a game which is fast paced and competitive, there are plenty of settings that accomodate for difficulty, weather, time and day to customize to your every need. If you want, you can have a Sunday drive in a classic vehicle on some of the worlds most famous roads, or have a heartracing encounter at bathurst behind the wheel of a true racecar. The Cars- If you like your cars, this is the game for you. There is a mass selection of cars that are available (without purchasing DLC packs) and you can also expand your garage and buy unique cars and show them off to other players. CONS:AI- When racing in a Singleplayer game, you would expect the AI to be somewhat realistic to online racers, but its dissappointing to see when your going for a pass (particularly on tight tracks) that the other cars seem to sway for no apparent reason, some even running of the track when making turns. Now this may not be a major issue and could even be fixed via difficulty settings, but its not a major setback. Online- Probably the most annoying thing in this game is the online community, yes there are people that do actively engage in Project CARS, but there certainly could be a heap more people that play. Its never really common to find a game that has more than 20+ people in the one race, but there are always racing groups which you can join and then play with them (I do that, because not many Australians play this in my opinion)Car Customisation- Please dont be fooled by the title, but Project CARS does not let you customise/ modify any of the cars (all you can do is customise liveries), not a big issue if your just into racing. Overall, this game certainly puts pressure onto Forza and Gran Turismo, as it really makes you feel like you are playing a professional racing simulator. There are arcade elements to the game, but if you want fast cars and pure racing, this is the game for you. Aside from the negatives, this game is thoughrougly enjoyable and will give you a pleasent suprise when you start to get into it. I can guarantee, if you spend the time to effectively tune and work on your car, you will be hooked for hours. (Just a note, I use an Xbox 360 controller and am getting a Logitech racing set to play)Rating- A (84/100)			"

												While there is no doubt that Project CARS is a more than solid Car Simulator, in terms of Features that make up a game, I was missing some key components. Most noticeably, the career mode feels like a placeholder until you find the time to make something that is fun with meaningful progress.I guess they never found the time.			"

												Out the box PCars isn't set up very well, the stock settings need tweaking to feel right, epecially if you're running a wheel. Then the individual preset car force feed back settings need work (install the Jack Spader Tweaker files, and the job is done for you). Finally, the race car settings are completely generic and need a bunch of adjustments; per vehicle and per track to get the best of a car.There's alot of hate for this title as it needs so much initial effort to enjoy, you can spend hour upon hour messing around with car settings. Then you need to test tweaks on a track and rinse and repeat until you nail a good car setup. It's far too much work, it really is, you shouldn't be tasked into into so much setting up where the dev has failed to spend the time. However there are shortcuts, online databases have decent settings to copy from.Once you've overcome all of the above, PCars is very good, it's got lots of content and look gorgeous. Sure the physics aren't quite up their with other top tier racing sims, but neither is it as bad as some people complain about either.I run a full racing sim rig, direct drive wheel, fancy pedals and all the trimmings, and this game feels great to me. My setup is expensive and big, it's not typical and it elevates racing games beyond being just a game. But I fully understand why casual racers can't get on with this title due to the steep learning curve required to navigate the confusing and massive amount of settings. "

												Project CARS is truly a next generation sim experience.  This game is really something special and an evolution in racing and gaming in general backed by the power of WMD.  Raising the bar to new levels from the [literally] jaw dropping visuals to the high levels tuning and technicalities of the tire simulation.  There's so much to talk about from the dynamic weather that can mimic real world conditions, a deep career with realistic and challenging AI, a complex damage and wear system, to the solid arsenal of cars and tracks made to the highest of standards you really need to see to believe. Developed by racers, for racers, where our opinions and ideas actually made a difference with the outcome of the game.  With that said, is it perfect?  No.  It's not without a few bugs here and there but I can tell you SMS will be supporting it and patching things in well into the future.  The level of detail and high standards shows you just how much they care about it.  If you're a gearhead and/or like racing games I highly recommend getting your hands on this.  A word to the competition: The bar has been raised.  So step your game up!Disclaimer:I was a Team Member (2nd lowest toolpack). I have virtually nothing to gain from the success of this game. I logged nearly 500 hours during the development period simply because I couldn't stop playing it. I advise you to wait for more reviews to start rolling in if you feel my opinion is biased.			"

												6.8/10Pros:-Race cars that arent home made or modded intot he game!-Tracks that let you go vroom vroom-Its pretty as all can beCons:-The game has a mind of its own on whether it is going to work properly or not (in game)-Pits sometimes work in some ways. This has been 90% fixed with the lastest patches-Cut content and broken promises. The devs of this game made GTR2 and then split to form two seperate dev teams. One team when on to make Race07 and its dlc and kept it very very true to the format of GTR (it doesnt hold your hand, you have to do everything, drive out the garage, hit your speed limiter, drive a safe pace lap yourself, cautions both full and partial, and open for modding) My honest review of the game is that it is a half baked remake of race07/gtr2. Half baked int he sense that they ditched the SIMULATION aspects for the... pretty graphics? You cant even cut down a tire in this game. My honest suggestion is that if you want a hardcore racing sim get the race07 game and all its dlc, it goes on sale often for super cheap. You will get liscenced race cars from all over teh world and tracks as well. And when you want more content just get some mods and be on your merry way in anything you could imagine (ALMS, BlanPain, Le Mans, Rally, ETC)This review doesnt even begin to go into detail on the things that i have bared witness to on their forums... That is a fiasco showing that Mr. Ian Bell is by no means a man i want to give money to based on his mouth and way of cunducting business. I however, have already paid 30$ for this and so i aim to get my moneys worth out of it and struggle through it hoping it gets better with age and time. I ONLY reccomend getting this game if it is on sale for 25$(USD) or less. It is a ""40$ brand new"" title that you see many mid grade developers doing these days. i sincerely hope this game grows on me a bit more though. It has potential in about 5 years when the game's files get torn apart and modded because boy howdy being this pretty.... well the mods that will come in time will be marvelous. Shame that the team didnt allow that from the get go, but they have DLC to sell and well, the way they ""voted"" on whether it was to be allowed or not was reminisent of the old ""3/5th compromise"" as not all votes are equal over there.

												I can thoroughly recommend this game to those with an open mind. Physics wise it's a very complex sim,  not without it's faults, but other sims that people rate have had major physics rewrites, especially  tyre physics. The game is not without faults that much is obvious, the importance of the faults will  vary from one person to the next. I couldn't give a rats hairy crack about multiplayer or league  racing, but that's just me. Others do and for them PCARS falls short and I understand that. But for  me the overall experience is excellent. Graphically it is excellent, the details on the cars and the tracks are at times stunning when  combined with the day/night and weather transitions. On PC only Assetto Corsa comes remotely close and  it falls short compared to PCARS IMO, Kunos have done a stellar job updating the tracks but they are  still sterile compared to PCARS. The car models are excellent in both titles. But it's mainly the  PCARS Day/night and weather transitions that make me slack jawed in wonderment, it's a stunning  looking game. Probably the main reason some luddites call the game Simcade, as they refuse to believe  anything looking this good could be proper Sim as well.Sounds wise it falls short of Raceroom Racing Experience (hereafter referred to as R3E) which is the  best by quite a margin in this genre. But the sounds in PCARS are in the main well done, a few weird  engine notes but overall above average (no Gran Turismo esque ""hoovers"" here!). Ambient noise is well  done IMO, including sheep and cows at Bannochbrae (DLC).FFB is good for me, others don't rate it and that's fair enough it's a complex beast to setup right  and if your not invested in a game then it's daunting to wade through it. Luckily with My CSR  everything felt reasonably good out of the box, yeah I'd like a bit more road sensations but I can  tweak that in when I can be bothered. It's not a million miles away from the other Sims I have  (GSCE/AMS, RF2, R3E and AC) I can feel the front go light when locking up, front goes light in wet  weather when on slicks, I can feel weight transfer. Overall it's decent when it works and nowhere near  as bad as people make out.Physics is fine for me too, I spin when I push too hard and I can feel what the car is up to, I can  sort out handling issues by adjusting the relevant setting and can tame cars that have default setups  not to my liking. Cars are easy to drive under the limit which for some in the community means  ""simcade"", literally EVERY racing driver has stated that cars are in reality easier to drive under the  limit than some games would have us believe. Push the cars up to and over the limit and the cars  behave in a logical and realistic way, there no Ridge Racer or Need For Speed unreal levels of grip  here at all! ADD in the fact that apart from RF2 none of the others even have wet weather simulated at  all!!Career mode is interesting and varied, none of the short pathetic 2 lap races that console racers  start with (I'm looking at you Forza and GT!), but the length can be adjusted if the player wishes.  Most have Practise and qualifying (unlike Asseto Corsa which has a VERY console game like career  mode). Could do with a few more types of cars oustide of GT3, but overall decent enough. Weather  effects and time of day keeps you on your toes, think you know a track well, try it in the early hours  of the morning in low light and in a THUNDERSTORM!! Nerve jangling stuff especially when you see the  lightning! Scripted weather in main career races is puzzling though, strange decision.Yes the game has bugs, changes and omissions, these are all incredibly disapointing for everyone. Some  have logical reasons for why and a few do not. for me these do not detract from the overall. It's a  real shame and I hope that these issues can be solved with PCARS2. No official mod support is a bummer but I have Asseto Corsa, RF2, GSCE/AMS for that, PCARS was never going to support modding  properly, it was always going to be a franchise that gives us sequels rather than the traditional  method of devs and modders supporting a title for many many years. Some really dislike that and fair  enough that's their perogative and they can play the games that follow the traditional methods. SMS  have chosen this path and I believe it fits quite well, even at 45 euros I have more than got my  money's worth out of the game from release. And I'm not counting the multiple hours of enjoyment I got  when testing before release. Despite all that there are unofficial mods coming out so it IS possible, just not as easy as other Sims.I highly recommend this game as a single player value for money at full price. I FULLY recommend it in  a sale. If you're after something articially difficult with low grip then PCARS is not really for you,  if you want a game for modding it's not for you, if all you want is MP league racing it's probably not  for you. Other than that, love cars? Love racing? GET THIS GAME!!			"

												Not finshed game yet.Multiplayer with bad peer to peer games.Which leads to a lot of synchronizing issues.Not able to drive issue in a lot of cases.Wrong player list.Lap counter gets updated late in some cases etc.Beside of all the multiplayer issues there are great graphics and a fine music.Cockpits look very great. Handling is ok, not very much a sim, its some kind of half sim, but could be fun at least if they fix the multiplayer and deliver the dedicated servers.Only one setup is saveable per car and track which is ridiculous if you want to go online racing leagues in future.You cant save a qualy setup and a race setup for different lap races.But i think they will fix this in the future.Tyre temp graphic is wrong in some cars.Server browser is very bad.You cant order by anything.Filter is only for car class, not for exact cars.You cant see where the host is from.you cannot see the server settings in the server browser. How many laps for example, only short and long.No ping times etc.Very very bad.So verdict: I would not recommend this game at the moment if you look for a great racing experience in multiplayer.For me it is a dissapointment right now, but there is some hope it gets better with the upcoming patches. If refund would be possible, i would do it and maybe look again in some month.If you are more the singleplayer gamer, it is quite fun right now.			"

												Things you should know about Project CARS:- It's a simulator, not NFS Style arcade racing game. Try to play NFS style and you'll get frustrated easily- Don't start the career mode with carts and a Xbox 360 controller. It handles rubbish.- A wheel isn't mandatory neither is a controller, but you'll find it's better to play it with either than a keyboard- Multiplayer is fun, especially with friends. Even more so if they aren't used to sims. Watching them slide all over is hilarious- Looks incredibly pretty and runs pretty well too. - While it doesn't have mods like Assetto Corsa, the 'polish' and the overall quality is much better than AC.Overall, good game.

												The A.I. is honestly some of the worst A.I. I've ever seen.  All A.I. cheats in these racing games, they have to or you would crush them.  The way this game is though, it is 1990's bad.  Here is a list of the things the A.I. can and does do.1.  Ram you because they brake later.2.  Brake later because physics are not applied evenly.3.  When they do ram you, they are a brick and you are a bouncy ball (see evenly applied physics).4.  Go off the track and accelerate past you  because the grass doesn't effect them at all.5.  Drive in the rain on slicks.6.  Drive faster than is allowed by the rolling start rules.  You will literally start slower than they do, so they immediately pass you.7.  Take turns faster than you possibly can, they have the grip of the gods, see evenly applied physics.Honestly this game's A.I. is so horrendously bad I think GT2's was better in the 90's. It's like they cut and pasted this right out of a need for speed game.  Save your money, I wish I could get mine back.  I would much rather be playing Gran Turismo even though its sound quality is awful.  I wish so much that I could get my money back.			"

												Pros: It is a racing game, And it runs relatively well on a razer blade while using an Xbox controller in a different state from your main computer.Cons:It was sold as a genre redefining racing simulation using the community to help with creating all of our wildest dreams. Instead we get a half-baked buggy representation of racing (after 6 patches the Career karting will STILL occasionally not count the first lap you take), on top of poorly done physics, and in general just... It's gross.Do yourself a favor and at least get rFactor 1. If not, rFactor 2, assetto corsa, even R3E would be better. I'm partial to IRacing myself, but would still rather people buy any of those other games. (Also they have pretty cool devs.)			"

												You can see up there that I have put 8.4 hours into Project Cars. What that doesn't tell you is that all this time (not to mention my 19 posts in the game forum) was spent tweaking parameters and tryng to make the game minimally functional. So far I have been unsuccessful. I have never - never! - joined a single race or even spent a few minutes of practice on the track.Yes, it's a nice game, with beautiful graphics, and it has lots of potential. But, despite the hype, it is far from finished, the interface is quite clumsy and the force feedback issues make it unplayable. If you doubt me, visit the official forum. You will find literally hundreds of pages (one single thread about FFB issues has 141 pages and counting) with people trying to make sense of its obscure FFB parameters and discussing how to make the game work for them. The developers seem to be as bewildered as the users and are of little help, when not outright rude. Project Cars has been launched some two months ago and is already patched to version 1.4, but most problems remain unsolved. Since I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe software products should be sold only when they are fairly functional, instead of being sent out on the world to have their problems sorted out by their buyers (granted, some people actually seem to enjoy that), I give Project Cars a 3/10 at best. I may review my opinion later on when these problems are fixed, but right now, if you want a racing sim that actually works, go for Assetto Corsa.UPDATE: Now I have 13.7 hours into the game. This accounts for a whole afternoon spent trying to make FFB work. I still haven't driven a single lap.UPDATE 2: Patch 2.0 is out, supposedly to fix FFB problems among other things. Now I have 14.4 hours in the game. The difference was the time I spent lauching PCars, finding my pilot floating 5 meters above the ground, verifying it was still unplayable with my wheel (in fact, it got worse) and closing it in frustration. I also have 34 posts in the forum without a single helpful or informative reply from the devs (contrarily to other users, who are trying very earnestly to help each other play the game). I asked Steam for a refund and I am waiting for their reply.			"

												Did I really just pay full price for this buggy alpha game?Bloody hell it's s promising and the racing is so good, but the oculus support is a joke, wheel support is a joke. I'm talking silly things like: You spent 5 minutes selecting and calibrating your wheel. Save all of your settings, bu then when you leave and start the game over again, all settings are lost.. COME ON!Oculus is supported, but in extended mode only, no oculus compatible menus, which means just a REALLLY awkward experience startig the race on my PC monitor and then dragging it over to the oculus display, then having to constantly recenter my oculus view (which woops, the key is now unbound becaus eit didnt save your settings!).Also, once in a race, there is no way to access any graphics options, so when a certain option slows down your rig, or is buggy in the oculus, its a pain staking process of exiting the race, toggling 1 setting, starting a race, then exiting again, etc, etc.. COME ON!for years in development, it's very disapointing that obvious stuff like this was missed or just not cared about.			"

												pCars isn't the best sim but it's far from the worst. Even with all the hate it gets, the game is still a ton of fun and brimmed with content that will cater to anyone who loves to race. It feels a lot similar to GTR2 which is a classic so if you ever played that game, then you'll feel right at home with pCars. Pros: +Graphics. Even at low, it looks better than most racing sims out there. I personally love the weather effects.+Plenty of tracks to drive on.+Decent career mode that'll keep you busy for a while. Challenging AI. Cons: -Slightly mad  physics at times. Some cars never feel right even after a lot of tweaking.-Few laser scanned tracks (honestly it isn't that big of a deal to me, only the hardcore sim-mers care about this)-Car selection could've have been better.-Game needs to be restarted everytime a visual setting is changed which is kind of annoying.  Overall rating:  One of the best racers i've played, period.			"

												Initially it looks great. I can get a really good looking FOV in this game. The deeper you go, the more rough edges you run into. The menus and the way they work are a pain, often making things difficult to find, especially deeper options. I always load up this game for a few runs, but in the end something always turns me off and I head back to my other sim racers (Raceroom and Assetto Corsa), which are more focused and refined in their bases, and just offer what feels like a more realistic driving experience. Impressive at first and a good effort, but just too many rough edges to keep me around. Perhaps tries to do or be too much instead of focusing on one area.			"

												This game tries to capture the feeling of actual grand prix racing, but ultimately fails. My biggest issue with the game is the unrealistic physics. You get slides coming out of turns when you are clearly not under power, and you get AI that would rather plow right through you then actually make realistic decision. I would find it very hard to recommend this game to any racing or car enthusiast. Alas, my searce for a decent racing game continues...			"

												After 140h of playing Project CARS I would like to share my thoughts about this game. First of all let me state that I play with a Geforce GTX980 and a T500 RS + Th8A using the natural transmission type of the individual cars (i.e. clutch + H-shifter / sequential with paddles / sequential with shifter). In addition I mostly stick to the single player career mode with the following settings:- opponent strength of 80%- a session length of 30%- helmet camera- full damageand the following assists enabled:- traction control,- anti-lock brake,- stability control- partially visible racing lineAt the beginning I started to play with all assists off except racing line but found it way too time consuming to get used to the different cars' handling in order to achieve decent results. Even with the above-mentioned assists enabled, most cars are far from having a handling like being on rails. With many cars you always have to take care of not going full throttle in bumpy corners, on curbs or revving too high in low gears. So in essence this is for me by no means a casual game, but a game where you have to be fully awake and be willing to take the full grind of training, qualifying and race. For each event I am in absolute need of the training to get a feeling for the car and the track. With some car beasts or tracks one training session isn't even enough for me.Let's get to the pros and cons:+ excellent graphics, especially the lighting and rain effects+ dynamic weather and time-of-day changes+ many different cars and car classes+ many different tracks with different layouts+ many of the cars and tracks are great fun to drive+ immense feeling of immersion in helmet camera view, especially in the open wheelers+ nice sound+ good FFB (I use Jack Spade's tweaker files)+/- very demanding and time consuming to master the different cars and tracks+/- opponent AI- the available car models in some car classes are very unbalanced in terms of performance- the racing line braking points are quite often misplaced and thus useless- Due to the very strict short cut detection system it can sometimes be quite time consuming to get a valid lap time at all. In addition it is really annoying that you can get a short cut penalty even when the AI pushes you from the track.- The AI is way too quickly back on track once it gets off, while for yourself it can sometimes take ages to get back.- Unbalanced opponent strength: At 80% opponent strength, I often am 1 or 2 seconds faster than the AI while sometimes I am 3 seconds behind. E.g. with the 90's DTM Mercedes on the Nürburgring I don't stand a chance at all, while races with the Lancer in Monza are like a walk in the park.- For my flavour it rains too often in carrer mode. Even when it's currently sunny, if you forget to check the weather forecast for a three lap race, you can get in BIG trouble.- Save game is only stored locally and not in the Steam cloud. Not knowing that in the beginning once cost me about 40h of career progress.- Majority of Community Events requires owning DLCs.- Sporadically I have the suspicion that the driving assist and/or rain tyre selection detection is bugged as the handling can be like on soap.- Annoying menu for graphics and controller settings. You always have to leave the race for changing anything. In addition I can only partially navigate with my wheel buttons through the menu.- No possibility to save the progress within a race. For multi-hour races you can only put the race on pause, but you have to drive from beginning to end.Overall I give Project CARS a 7/10.			"

												The game takes a while to get used to as it is realistic and most of the cars are hard to control. Online is pretty toxic and most people just intentionally hit you and spin you. The career is rewarding and solo is good for testing new cars. This game also requires a controller or steering wheel.Overall I would recommend this game to people that are willing to learn and do not give up when they don't win a race, this is because it takes a while to learn how to handle the cars.

												This game has so many things going for it that it pains me to say don't touch it if you intend to invest amy more than a few hours of your gaming life. Every driving game with intentions of hooking you and keeping you coming back for more will allow you to create and save multiple car setups for each car at each track. For any serious driver, continous tuning of  setups for various weather conditions and tyre strategies for example, are  basic requirements. Every racing game form Crammonds F1GP1  back in the early 90's to present day allows you this joy. But not Project Cars! You have some of the best real time weather effects ever seen. You have more setup parameters than any racing game I have seen. BUT, you cannot create and save multiple setups for each car at each track. Its crazy I know but the developers did not include this basic feature that every other developer considers a must. Despite requests to fix this game killing omission none of the many patches to date have addressed this issue. In fact the developers have simply ignored it and refuse to even discuss it on their own forum? Don't buy it.			"

Nice attempt, but needs workThis game is extremely beautiful. It honestly is probably the best looking game I've ever played. If graphics alone made a game worth playing, this game would be brilliant.Unfortunately, this is about all the game is good for in it's current state. Vehicles respond ""poorly"" if I were to be kind. The game was unplayable when I first launched it because of a glitch in the FFB. I currently can not use FFB at all or the game is unplayable. Online has absolutely zero penalty for smashing into other cars nor is there a way to counteract it. If you were to purchase this game for photo mode or to watch the opening cutscene over and over, this would be a worthwhile purchase, but in it's current state it is BETA at best.UPDATE 5.0 Version: I've been playing since the 1.x version of the game and the controls are STILL incredibly terrible. They've seemingly made no attempts to make it translate more accurately. The FFB issues are STILL present, and you have to use 3rd party mods to make work correctly. Avoid this game like the plague.			"

												Initially, when the game came out, game was unplayable on day one for me and many others, my situation was computer locking out (freezing) each time i started a race and drove my car for 30 seconds. After a few attempts at trying to solve the situation, i decided to give up and put this game on the wait-list and try again months later.Today (18th August), i decided to try this game again. To my surprise many of the issues i had before are now gone thankfully. Yet, game is still unplayable with random issues occuring from time to time. Did a free lap session as usual to try out the game, figured i would test the game once more for potential issues. First time worked fine, i drove a racecar for a while but i didn't costumize my controls (can't do this ingame), so i quit the free lap session, which ended up in a forced game crash out of nowhere.Now, after messing with the options and controls for a few minutes. I decide to give it a go again, to my surprise (once more), my game glitches out everytime i get in race now. Screen turns dark, i can see the pre-race menu, can't do anything from there. Sound still works, game seems frozen so i'm forced to shut down the application manually.I would give it another try later but i really lost interest in this glitched up mess of a game, i had hopes that the game would run fine now, after a few months of its release, but nope.In other words, don't buy this game yet, it's not worth it. You will likely run into alot of glitches and bugs, if you want to play it that badly, be prepared for anything. I see alot of people complaining in the forums about random issues, you could just end up being one of those people if you so happen to buy this game and give it a try.Now it's time to unistall this game and add it to the pile of games that will never see the light of day again. It's a sad thing really.PS: At the rate they are fixing the game, buy it in a decade or so, perhaps then it will be running smooth with little to no issues.			"

												I can't recommend this game right now. Maybe after a few patches but not right now. This game is FULL of game breaking bugs. This game could have used another delay and that would have been the smart thing for Slightly Mad Studios to do instead of rushing out this incredibly buggy game. So let me point out just a few bugs that I have been experiencing lately in Project CARS. Can't play single player because my laps don't register so I can be racing until the end of time. When I finish a race in first place, the game will sometimes register it as last place. While racing and being in first place, the game will switch my position from 1st to last or any other position making me lose the race. Playing online is the reason why I bought this game. Big mistake. This game is almost impossible to play online without experiencing bugs. I don't even know where to start. Lobbies are endless pits and sometimes can't start the race. Sometimes I'll be adjusting settings in the lobby and it will start the race while I'm still adjusting settings for the race. Hud display vanishes while racing, can't tell which position I'm in unless I use the cockpit view. Cars hop around the track constantly. Lets say the race is 4 players, the game will make me start at the end of the starting grid even though we are only 4 racers...I can go on forever with these bugs but I have better things to do like play Assetto Corsa.

												PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING. As mentioned by another reviewer, there is an enforced deadzone which cannot be removed, even though deadzone settings are set to '0'. I'm not sure whether this affects all wheels, however, it has made this game virtually unplayable in the admittedly very brief 30 minutes I have spent on it. Sadly, even when I overlook this huge issue which makes delicate steering corrections impossible, the cars feel strangely disconnected from my steering inputs, making them behave unpredictably and sadly much like RC cars, rather than than high performance cars they are advertised to simulate. This could be a personal problem, however, having spent far too much time throughout my life on racing games I can honestly say, this is a problem unique to this game. I also own Assetto Corsa, which seems to be Project Cars' main competitor and the cars in that game feel weighted and react accordingly, whereas this game offers absolutely no 'feel' for the cars whatsoever. Extremely disappointed!			"

												Search for issues and bugs before buying. It may not launch until you start it without Steam. It may stop working and throw errors, requiring a new 22 GB download to install again. There's not much support offered, if any.It can feel nice as a racing sim though, and if you have nothing else and miss GT or Forza, it can be an unforgiving - but approachable replacement as long as you're not attached to car customization or selection. What it lacks in outright car selection in the road and touring classes, it makes up for in range of car classes, more like the Pro Race Driver series.If you like big tracks like the Nordschleife... you better have lots of time because you can't start practice/hot lap with warm tires. So that's a good 15-20 minutes just to do a fair run, assuming your car's in mint condition on lap 2.I can't recommend it for its serious rough spots and issues, but it can be a fun and gorgeous game if it actually runs for you.

I've played it yesterday, turned off my PC, today started it again, loaded up the game, and it welcomed me as a new player. Save game file gone. I am not interested as much in the multiplayer part of the game, so career mode is what in it for me. But I can not enjoy it, because (for the second time) the game decided that my profile has to go.

												I will not recommend this game yet. It is obviously an open beta version. The goal was: Make the best racing game ever!That was a complete failure! Why? They started with a simulation and ended up with an arcade game. It not far away from games like forza. Real SimRacers who are used to RaceRoomExperience, Assetto Corsa, iRacing or rFactor can just smile about the physics. The tyre physics are completely surreal. If you are going over the slip angle and the car starts drifting you can just catch it in a split second. No overheating at all. Just a small mistake! DfuqThe menu is crap. It doesnt work. - Some options you take at the very beginnin cant be found again.- HUD changes are not saved. - Replays are found behind the profile.- You cant see what session is running if you are not on the server and even then its pretty hard to figure out- you cant undo some changes like the car classes without closing and reopening the serverThe sound is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sry but even if you are not comparing it to r3e which is the game with the best racing sounds on the market atm. Its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. To quite, to noisy, the formula cars are broken.Replay function is broken. If someone left the race before it was finished the one is not at the replay. The complete replay hud is not working. Why should it? No Telemetrydata at the replay, you can only see yourself, its not even possible to have a free cam. The presetups for the cars which should be an all functional standard setup. Are crap. They are made for the console guys with their controller. I can accept that. But the setups are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. They broke a lot of rules you never ever do. So some cars are literally undriveable untill you made some better settings.BUT to be fair. The graphics are overhelming. "

												I got into the game. changed the graphics options aaaaaaaaaand what do you know the game dosnt even start anymore. finnaly got the game to work and looks like absolute crap. The worst engine sounds i have ever heard in a racing ""sim"" games from ps2 have better sounds and mechanics than this game. My front brakes were at 1200 degrees celsius and still looking nice and shiny  not even the slightest bit red games from ps2 had this feature. The engine sounds are like a mosquito in a blender. When i originaly seen this game on its website probably a year ago i seen so much potential in this game but no they screwed it up			"

												One of the greatest racing sims I've played ever!I saw this game back in early devepment and instantly wanted to put my money in. I knew this game had potential because it had the team responsible for the NFS SHift games that I love so thought this could go know wrong and boy was I not. This game has that perfect blend of sim that you want from a game that looks this pretty. With the detail of the vehicles and the tracks you are not expecting an arcady racer, you expecting something more and this game really delivers on that. The feel of the cars are completely believeable and the all the tuning options that they give you effect you vehicle also in a realistic matter, a way that you would expect it to happen.That is what make this game great. You choose one out of the fully detailed vehicle, so then choose from one of the masterfully done tracks and then you go and start driving, tuning and then you take then you join others with the car and the game immersses you to the point where you feel like, the car is your car. That's the great experiance you get out of this game.This game could definitely be more but for it's first iteration, this is definitely a racing game that'll be coming up over the years. Can't wait to see what is done with the next game and hope they are taking in the players good input.			"

												Utterly woeful game. The game has its own force feedback, which is all wrong- which means that cars can be uncontrollable at times and you cannot save a car from spinning- if you get in a spin you will hit something. The AI are rubbish and inconsistent- either slow or really fast but both times they smash you off the track, karts don't drive at all like karts do in the real world, the damage model is too sensitive and there are still too many bugs and glitches to call this game a simulator. The recent update has only made this worse, and the control settings are still idiotic. Overall even GRID Autosport drives better than this game, best off saving your money for something else. This game is a huge disappointment- it has potential, but it seems to have been made quite badly.			"

												Project Cars is a very average sim racing game. Assetto Corsa is miles a head in physics. Project cars doesn't even support triple screens fully like Assetto Corsa and iRacing. This game is way over hyped and is a big disapointment. Anyway after some adjustments the game seems to be alot better, but its still not as good as iRacing imo.			"

												I'm reviewing this as a game for the HTC Vive. I bought the game after the last patch which added SteamVR support, and I've not played it as a normal racing game on a monitor.Initial set-up was painful for me. My advise is to totally unplug the Vive and go through the initial setup of your wheels and pedals on the desktop and make sure they're working. It's also far easier to create a career profile if you can see your keyboard while you're doing it. Also there continues to be an annoying bug in Steam Big Picture/SteamVR Overlay where wheels and pedals are interfering with the controls making it impossible to interact with Steam. To get this game to work I first start SteamVR, then plug in my wheel, then plug in my pedals then, from the desktop, start Project Cars In VR. Then... everything is peachy.As for the game itself: To me it's absolutely marvellous. Seriously. Being able to sit in these cars and karts, to have depth perception of the incoming road, to really feel like I'm there... well I'm finding it a LOT easier to drive than I normally do in these sorts of games. The graphics are pretty much as you'd expect from a Vive game: Resolution isn't great, you can't turn everything up to ULTRA FULL AMAZING without killing your system... but that doesn't matter at all. The cars and karts are detailed and the enviroments are breathtaking, especially with all the different weather and lighting conditions. The immersion is there, ultra quality can come later with better GPUs.There seems to be a great range of tracks, including quite a few I know, some I've never seen before but they've all been great and well modelled so far. Project CARS likes you to do a practice round, then a qualifying round, then the actual race. You can skip these, if you like, but I find that going through all these steps methodically is the best way of learning the tracks and learning the cars. It tells me I should go into the pits and set a 'pit strategy' but I don't care about any of that. Maybe that stuff is good but it's too nerdy for me. I just want the car to be set up right out of the box and so far I don't really have any complaints about the defaults. There seems to be a good selection of cars. Nothing on the scale of Gran Turismo and the 'normal road car' selection is sadly lacking but then the game is really about fast cars and racing so it's understandable. So basically: So far I'm really into this. If you're a Vive owner with a wheel this is absolutely an essential purchase. If you're a Vive owner without a wheel I probably wouldn't recommend it... this game needs a wheel. It really does. Should Vive owners buy a wheel and the game? Well, that's a trickier one. If you've ever owned a wheel in the past and really enjoyed something like Forza or GT on the consoles then this is probably exactly the PC racer you're looking for. My feeling is that if you own a Vive then getting a flight stick and a wheel and enjoying racing sims and elite dangerous is all part of making the most of your stupidly expensive headset so... yeah. Why not? tl;dr: The best racing sim available for the HTC Vive.			"

												I bought my FIRST EVER racing wheel for this game. And I do not regret the choice ONE BIT. This game gets me sweating, cursing and screaming bloody murder as I cross the finish line. A wonderful game. Got my very first DLC, and now ""Project: CARS 2"" has been announced. This game was brilliant, but I will not support the developers greed, or poor decision making with publisher choice.EDITED AFTER PATCH 6.0:It is currently my favorate racing game, they have fixed many issues (took quite some time, and MANY MANY things are still buggy or broken. Chat boxes pit options and in general PITS) and it is very exciting to play when you can find or host a good group of fellow racers. The developer gets the thumbs down here. I am sure many more PAID DLC packs are coming on the path to Project Cars 2, which will feature many Pcars 1 assets and promises. Just like This game uses many from the ""Need For Speed Shift"" series. Take it or leave it. I wish I had left it, but it can be brillant when its not asking for money, now or later.$85 full price with all DLC, and they are THIS close to releasing the new game. Which of course will require all new DLC as well.Leave it I say.EDITED AFTER FORUMS VISIT:I am astounded by the snarky, and out right disrespectful comments the devolpment team has for critics. I would like the lead developer to leave his ""This is us, not supporting Pcars1 people"" patch comments on Steam. I'm sure the team won't. Here on STEAM they cannot ban or berate at will (Not currently, or ever was a member of the forums)EDIT AFTER PATCH 7.0: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! More bugs, no pit crews, we are seven months later here and they are trying to release another game while this is still very broken. Development team now telling users it is THEIR fault (Told not to run extended races, certain tires, wait for pit to work correctly, not to run timed races, avoid interior views during racing at sunrise or sunset...Wait WHAT?!) More disappointments.			"

												It's like if Goat Simulator was a racing sim. I cannot advise any stronger that people stay away from it, and don't even consider touching it with a barge pole.- Cars can be launched into the sky for no clear reason- Half the car can begin to levitate, and driving becomes impossible until this ghostly influence stops- AI is a mess, exceeding track limits and causing wreckless collissions every single lap of every single race. Makes career mode pointless.- Setup menu is buggy. Some settings only take effect if you save the setup then quit and reload the session.- The pit menu only opens when you're in your pit box. You sit still with your pit crew doing nothing until you've finished selecting what you want in the menu- Reporting bugs, and asking for help on the official forums will get you banned... Yes. Seriously.PCars is only good as a hotlap sim with these issues. The bugs will ruin your races if you enter anything longer than a short sprint, or if you join a league.The developers have their heads buried in the sand about real problems. The head of SMS (Ian Bell) has had numerous public outbursts, outright insulting people who are genuinely experiencing game breaking bugs. It's a miracle even a handful of bugfixes came out of these people post release.0/10 would not back again. It doesn't matter what kind of racing you're interested in or what your skill level is, this is NOT the right game for you.			"

												After +100h into career mode, all Gold accolades except for two, only 7 invitational events to unlock, the 4 longest endurance made and lots and lots of seasons the game suddenly crashes and deletes my profile.The game doesn't have Steam Cloud Sync (this game was released in 2015, absurd that it doesn't have cloud security) so I lost everything because the game wanted so.♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ SMS, this is the second time I buy a game from them and I receive utterly garbage (Shift 2 was the first but I thought EA had part of the fault).Don't expect from SMS anything related to post-launch support, they will release the game and move into begging money for another one while saying that features promised for this game will be in the sequel.BTW AI is too agressive, don't get affected by weather, tire wear, penaltys, etc.Shortcuts work bad, they said that it got improved, but feels exactly the same as in Shift 2.Guest in multiplayer are desynced so they can lose a race even if they win for 1s of advantage.Car categories are too limited, most of them with only one car, the game doesn't even have a log of which color pattern you like in your car and you need to select it each time you choose it. It's actually kinda funny since if you are in a multiplayer lobby and want to get your car you have to go to the full car list because the filter put by the host only works for a random pick.Community challenges are way too DLC-attached. There's an achievement (I know is optional but it works as an example) that needs you to play 20 community events, guess what? Without DLC you can't even access 10 per year.TL;DR Don't buy this if you want gameplay, it's only good for the graphics.			"

												Ive not had the best past with project cars and im not sure why. Firstly is that i have a problem getting it to run, im not sure when but it decided it no longer wished to run on either my laptop or my desktop pc's, both are very high spec which is a shame, it will get to first splash screen and then give up on trying and crash to desktop. Afterthat is the actual game and I am basing this on back when i had the ability to play it  in the early summer period. First is the interface, its not great but its serviceable, it works but it could do with a bit of polish.Next is the car selection, i think i like the selection, its not massively extensive but there is nice variation and each class is fleshed out rather nicely. I dont like the fantasy skins though and id prefer it if there was some sort of option to allow the skins to be 4k, maybe a texture pack that one could download but that doesnt seem possible which is a shame. The dlc car content is also nice but i think that the packs are too small and i would have prefered if there were more dlcs that were the size of the japanese pack and judging by the community it seems like they would prefer it to happen as well.Track selection is outstanding, there is a massive number of tracks its truely fantastic but most of them are not laser scanned and i can feel it at times, like something is just missing, maybe ive gotten a little too used to laserscanning, maybe its a placebo im not sure.  Next is the driving, people can go on and on about the physics as to whether they are realistic or not, are they challenging, does assetto corsa have better physics, its a battleground a lot of the time with that debate. Anyways in my opinion the road cars feel way off, they are horrid, i cant even touch them because they just put me off a ton. But race cars are what matter most anyways, they do feel a lot better than the road cars but i still get a faint feeling that the grip just isnt right, maybe that is to do with the feedback that i get or the times where the cars show behaviour which doesnt seem right, its a bit like the uncanny effect that we have to faces where the closer we get the more we notice slight problems, same with this, even without getting extremely technical i find that it just doesnt feel right at times. Graphics: Personally speaking i have an unpopular opinion and that is that pcars doesnt look nice at all in its vanilla presets but thats because i try to search for the immersion factor of reality and the chromey effect that vanilla pcars has is very bad at this thankfully there are mods that can fix this and with those applied the game looks outstanding, the tracks have a great level of detail, the cars for the most part look great bar a few things. Sounds: No, they are just bad, as i said earlier i search for immersion factor. Project cars fails massively here because it does it wrong, they focus on trying to make a car sound good instead of sounding like how it should of which they have failed with a very large majority of cars here. There are common sounds that are copied, they took the sounds and set a preamp of something crazy like +5db and its a crazy distorted mess. I understand that some people like this sort of sound but I personally cannot stand it. I think this is the poorest part of the game. Racing features: They do rather well here, there are a few oddities with the pits where you cant control it and being inside an ai instead of waiting but for the most part the racing ruleset and features are close to class leading and why people say that it had a lot of polish. Online: I didnt race too much online so i cant comment much here. Career/AI: I liked the concept, some people questioned the reasoning behind it  but racers will know,  the euphoria from earning it is what matters, you dont need some carrot dangled in front of you to race sadly this immersion is lost a bit because the AI simply isnt face, i can best them with the default setup easily and im a rather average paced sim racer In the end though ive encountered too many issues with the game such as getting my wheel to register, dialing in ffb being harder then it needed to be granted guides helped a ton with this, AI being problematic in open wheelers and modding something as simple as a skin should be a bit easier to do. Also the minor problem of it not running on either of my rather powerful systems is a shame and I will not recommend something that doesnt work.			"

												I'm playing this game on my HTC Vive, and I have to say it's one of the best racing game I've ever played.The VR support of all the menus and in-car is the perfect example of how UI/UX should be done in VR. The immersion is just incredible inside the car.Sure it's not a simulation like Assetto Corsa and it has its faults: the tracks are very flat (no bumps) and large, grip is tremendous for every car, braking points can be missed without consequences but the fun is definitely there. The AI is sometimes very stupid and will ram you for no reason, overall it's not a difficult game, but it's aimed to enjoy racing with different cars, reducing frustration of having to learn the tracks by heart and mastering a car.The graphics are gorgeous. Cars are perfectly modeled and the weather is actually the most impressive thing to witness both on cars and on tracks. TLDR:For non-VR:I really recommend this game if you'd like a great and enjoyable racing experience. It's a perfect balance in between Assetto Corsa which is a pure racing simulation, and Need for Speed Shift, or Need for Speed (the latest) which are arcade racing games. Graphics are really above its competitors.For VR: Best racing game at the time of review. Everyting can be done with the Vive on and the immersion is incredible. Definitely a must-buy.			"

												I grew up with Gran Turismo 1 and on, Forza etc, done some real racing in real life (Corvette C5 Z06 at Laguna Seca) and for me the main issue with this game is that, attempting to counter-steer out of an oversteer condition results in you over-correcting, no matter what, and then fighting it left and right and left and right until you spin out. Even completely getting out of the throttle wont prevent this. I've gone in and reduced Steering and Throttle Sensitivity all the way to zero and it still does it. For me this is completely unacceptable. The handling in this game is down-right broken. I am using an XBox 360 controller on the PC. I wish I learned this within the Steam refund policy time-frame. This issue aside, the car roster is completely abysmal. The only car I drove for the few hours or so of owning this game was a McClaren P1. The game also looks nowhere as good as it does in the trailers. This with everything maxed out. It looks very bland. I can't recommend this game at all.  "

												I  have put a lot of time in to this game as you can see, and yet I still keep coming back to it.I have pretty much all the other racing sims/games in my library and across other formats, but this out of all hits the sweet spot, it has a bit of everything, totally addictive, graphics are good, even on my machine at low-med, sound is ace, and physics of the cars, and feel of tyres and grip, just can't be beaten so far for me, so much so I even purchased on PS4, where surprisingly the pad controls translate better than I thought possible for something as technical as a sim.I can't praise the experience enough, once you have given it a few hours to master, you'll find there is no better representation of vehicular competitionMotorsports simulation at it's best(reminds me, in atmosphere or a new era Toca race series game), and one that is going to evolve, with additions and new features for years to come.I would score this highest out of any of my racing games, a true petrol heads dream, if you are on the fence, dont be, go for it, you won't regret it if you are a true car/motorsports fan, thumbs up			"

												If ever there was a day and night difference between the overhyped scores of 'professional' reviewers on Metacritic, IGN etc and actual user experience then this is the embodiment of this all too common phenomenon. This game should never have been released. I will only scratch the surface of this rotting, vulture-devoured carcass by mentioning the following bugs:- In multiplayer cars can't even exit the garage half the time, forcing you to exit and re-enter lobby. - starting grids often start with a tornado like effect of random cars being dropped sideways on the starting grid almost as if delivered by a sky-dwelling demon. This often results in a penalty being given to the unexpecting exorcist act victim.- open wheelers drive like the chassis is made of limp carrot and the tyres are suspended on sea sponges. Formula A handling is most disastrous.- AI are to put it very kindly inconsistent. To put it bluntly they behave like a rebellious teenager experimenting with recreational drugs. The results are always unexpected.- Finishing positions are sometimes displayed in incorrect order. You might clearly finish 2nd but the results table puts you in top spot. I mean WTF?- I've lost count of the number of times the game has frozen or just shut down entirely.I could continue til the cows come home.The most conceited and enraging thing about all this - Slightly Mad Studios has the nerve to start crowdfunding for development of Project Cars 2. Send a strong message to SMS that their greed and incompetence is unacceptable. You can do that by not buying this game or better still buy it, try it and get your steam refund asap. In most other arenas of commerce this kind of behavior would be bordering on criminal. A defective product sold on the back of glamorous pre release hype is a clever, get-rich-quick scheme plotted by soul-less thieves. Now only absolute morons should contribute to round two of self-inflicted flogging.			"

												It's amazing how much a game can change post release.  I was very excited for the retail release of Project CARS.  With many hundred hours sunk into Gran Turismo, Forza, and more recently Assetto Corsa, I had high expectations, especially after the months of hype lead up.  Additionally, being an experienced real life driver with many fender to fender road races and some rallying under my belt, I feel that I can see these simulations with a grain of salt.  That said, the day one version of this title was not good, mostly due to the control setup / feedback with a steering wheel.  Everything just felt so wrong.  Even though I could sense that there might be a sound physics model under the hood and the pretty face, the inputs felt so nonlinear and highly exaggerated at the extremes.  It made car control incredibly tricky and completely unrealistic.  I immediately went to the forums to look for help and found I was not alone, many other reported similar issues and suggested control tweaks.  I tried many of them with varying levels of success, none of which bringing the game to the level I thought it should be.  I stopped playing after about a week of fiddling.  What a disappointment.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I see the version 4.0 update information, I decided to give it another go.  Am I glad I did, THIS is what the game should have been like on day one.  How it made it out with the controls in the state that it did is completely unbelievable to me, especially with the whole community assisted beta aspect.			"

												The more I play it, the less I like it. The dynamics are way overdone beyond simulation. Without a wheel, don't bother.Without perfected throttle and steering control, theres absolutely no skid pad or room for mistakes or fun beyond simulated driving in this game. Looks great, sounds great, all the options are amazing, lot's of neat positives in this game and all the cool race trakcs as well. Decent game all around, just dosen''t have the fun handling.			"

												Theres a good game here, if you can see it through all the bugs. I got the game a month or two after release. I bought it to play multiplayer in private matches with my brothers. So that is the only area I have really given any time to.Unfortuantly even at the time of writing this review, half a year later, the multiplayer is still riddled with game breaking bugs. Silly ones like it always ignoring your qualifying position and falling through the floor. There were plenty more.Its a shame, as I know I would really like the game if it wasn't for the bugs, but the frequency of the bugs are too great. In the last gaming session I had prior to writing this, not one race went by with out some oddity or other happening. Some were quite bad, others were amusing. but all in all it ruined our experience.They have been releasing patches at an OK rate, but still its massively bugged. Single player maybe fine, I don't play it.			"

												The worst GT racer I've ever had the displeasure of playing... Very bad AI to a point that it feels like i'm playing with 10 yr olds on-line who are hell bent on me not finishing the first lap! Weather is a complete joke suns out 2 corners later it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it down and by the end of the lap it's like blackburn on one of it's more common rainy days then by the end of the next lap the sun's out it's bone dry I've got my  shorts out along with the factor 50!! Pit crew can't tell the difference between classes ""keep pushing and you'll have them on the next straight!"" Sorry I'm in a GT4 car and the next car is a GT3!?! WTF!! I think I'm good but serously as my car been fitted with something I don't know about?! Good points are that I can turn it off and play something else..			"

												TLDR: Project Bugs - ""The Devs know about the problems, but it will surely be solved in PCars2""My review is based on over 540 hours of multiplayer gameplay. The more you play this game the more bugs you will encounter. First off the cars sounds different online compared to offline, the ""whine"" sound from the gearbox or whatever is not present in multiplayer until the 2nd game in the same lobby and it's a well known bug. This makes some cars sound quite different and in some cases quite dull and boring online. Then comes the steering ratio bug, when I first load into a session and go out of the pits, the steering ratio will always be 900 degrees no matter what car, and requires and Alt-Tab to overcome this(may be my ancient wheel is to blame). Not forgetting to mention changing your steering ratio in setup requires a session rejoin to take effect. Ok then I'm ready to go on with qualifying, or at least try to. You see everyime someone joins the session you get a split second delay (I get about 0.5 sec of screen freeze, some people get up to 3 sec). Imagine driving in Monaco and you get that freeze? into the wall you go, freeze while you're under heavy braking? you WILL overshoot the corner, freeze while turn in? wide you go, freeze while on the straight? you're fine. It's a lottery while trying to do qualifying. Gone are the outlap-hotlap-inlap style, you HAVE to put like 5 laps fuel and go round until you HOPEFULLY get a clean lap.On to the race. Theres a bug where cars spawn on each other, if a car happen to spawn on top of you and lands on you, you WILL get a drive through penalty because your car moved. If anyone decides to jump the start and hit you = drive through penalty for you. If you manage to survive the race start then great. Since my location gives me about 250 ping I'm always delayed at the start and lose places but I don't think this is the game fault, I can't upgrade distance to server. Also I can jump start like 0.5 sec to 1 sec without penalty, or maybe it's because of my ping, or another bug.On to the racing. Cars will STICK to one another on side contact. Once 2 cars touch, they lose all steering capability and will just slide straight off the track or until they come apart. Penalty system is literally useless. There is NO PENALTY FOR RAMMING. Imagine T1 at Monza, someone hits you and you're forced through the chicane at T2, the rammer just continues on because he's still on track, you on the other hand are considered to have ""CUT THE CORNER"" and get a 10 SECOND penalty where you can't accelerate. There is another abuse where you can cut chicanes without penalty and gain massive time in a race. Track limits is also another problem, on some corners 1 wheel on the grass is considered cutting the track but on some other corners you can go all 4 wheels off and hit the wall and yet it is not considered cutting the track, with this technique you can actually gain time on some tracks by 'wallriding' or you can run wide on some corners and gain time(eg. Degner 1 & 2 at Suzuka).Onto car setup. Some settings are just not realistic. On some class like GT3, running 0 camber  is still the best. And then there is the abuse of running 0 radiators & brake ducts. The telemetry for tyre temps is inaccurate for the inside, center and outside of the tyre. Using full negative camber can result in higher outside tyre temps. Also the left front bump stop seem to be the only one that can hit 'red' and not the other 3 bump stop corners. ""Live"" telemetry is not that useful because you have to drive and see telemetry at the same time which is hard. You can download apps for telemetry recording but the problem is suspension is not part of the numbers which you can see, and suspension setup is critical for a race car. You can only have 1 setup per car/track combo, so if you want to have multiple setups you have to manually record and enter it. There is a 'summary screen' in setup where you can screenshot but it doesn't include all the settings you can do on the car so it's kind of pointless.Chat was broken a few patches back and never fixed. You cannot chat in the online lobby, you have to drive out of the pits, park somewhere and chat. Vote kick function doesn't work, only the host can kick. There is a bug where it auto kicks people randomly in the session.Replays are completely broken and never fixed since game launch. Cars parked on the grid, missing cars etc. Saved a replay where you just had an exciting race? or a collision? Go to check it out and see yourself racing against nothing, crash with nothing. Completely useless feature.If you like hot lapping and top the leaderboards you have to abuse the 0 radiators & brake ducts to get the 'perfect' lap. Also since there's not gearbox protection you can downshift like a mad man 6th gear to 2nd gear in a second to maximise engine braking without penalty, and you can off tyre wear so your tyres don't degrade throughout the lap.Having spend some time in the official forum you read about all the problems people have with the game, promised features which will never be in the game, and also all the bugs which will never be fixed. Forum threads questioning the developers on these topics often end in arguments and the thread closed. Some 'top people' will defend the game with their life even though there are so many problem with the game itself. It's like they're blinded by something and don't want to see the issues. I even saw an insta-ban on someone for insulting the game. It seems the common answer to every problem with the game is ""It's a well known bug"", ""The Devs are aware of this"", and the most popular is ""It will be solved in Project Cars 2""Resources spend for fixing the game is less than resources for new DLCs. Makes sense because it is a business after all but if your product is of such low quality then you will lose more people compared to people buying the DLCs.Other stuff you will encounter include:Hitting invisible wall/car while leadingDriver floating without carDriver floating in mid air(Imola chicane)Hitting a landmine(literally car flies & flip) - too bad for youFFB bug where it feels like you have a flat but you don't - requires game restartTotal lost of steering wheel functions - requires game restartScreen freeze but sound still works - requires game restartOpponent car stuck at 45 degree angle, creating smokescreen for everyone behindQualifying 1st only to discover someone beat you with a time of 00:00:0000Cars spawn on other cars/upside down on the grid, or in pitlane during race start""But hey maybe all this will be solved in PCars 2 eh?""Overall I give this game a 5/10 and that's being generous. Only because of the fun racing I have with the friends I met racing online. If you plan to buy this game for serious racing then don't, this is a ""Sim-Cade"". Only buy if there's a massive discount. There are better sims on steam which are cheaper, have better physics, and less bugs.edit* typo			"

												This game is all about the professional racing experience. Assetto Corsa and Race07 were my go-to racing sims before Project Cars came out.  I've been in the racing sim genre as long as anyone else and I can say, without a doubt, that I completely enjoy the setup of this game.Don't want to grind out the cash to finally race your dream car? No problem, you don't have to. Every car is available from the start.Tired of being trialed through licenses to race your favorite kind of race? No problem, you can do it all from the start.This game is purely about testing/tuning/practicing.  The racing is just the icing on the top.  The AI are extremely aggressive, but smart.  If you are off the pace, you won't be able to bump your way to the front...because the AI are already planning on getting you out of their way.  It's a culture shock to those who are used to very passive AI systems.The phyiscs, while different than Assetto Corsa and Race07 (and Forza/GT), are not arcady and closer to the previously mentioned games.  Each sim has a different feel and I'm glad to say that this game nails tire physics.  Unlike Codemaster's games, where you can feel the 'rail' that they want you to race (*cough* F1 series), this game allows you total freedom to miss an apex or not. It's however you want (or can) take the turn. Career mode is definitely deep.  And by deep, I mean if you want to succeed on more difficult settings, you have to practice, tune, re-practice, and re-tune.  You start by choosing a class to race in, which is tiered (cart/open wheel, GT, and Prototype - form three linear paths)...all ending with the LMP1 class.  You choose a team to race for and it's only a couple who are interested in hiring you, so expect to learn a car that you didn't expect to learn before.  From there, it's all progression.  You can set just about everything, from race-length, time of day, practice/qualifying sessions, to AI difficulty...all while you've already started your career.On top of that, the DLC package was extremely cheap and came with cars that I find interesting and useful.  Free updates are on the way, but cheap (and quality) DLC like this is rare.Plain and simple, this game was meant for people who dream of living the life of a racecar driver.			"

												Hello all, In terms of content Project CARS is really nothing to complain about , plenty of tracks, plenty of cars.The weather system is something I would want to see in Assetto Corsa but I know that won't happen I guess.In terms of the sense of speed , that is lacking, it is a bit of a bummer.The feeling of cars or tracks is a bit of the downside of this game. For example I drove the P1 around Spa, the bumps, the curbs were not there in the meaning of I couldn't feel them through the wheel (G27). A little bit inward the curbs you got these little bumps which I could feel. Then we get to the car, the P1 there was no connection to the road, I should've felt something but the only thing I felt was the rear stepping out on various occassions , 1st to 3rd gear in a straight but also in 5th gear through a high speed corner, I mean come on guys you delayed the game soo many times already and yet this happens? 3rd or 2nd gear exiting a corner I can imagine the back stepping out but , 5th gear on quarter to half throttle going more than 160km/h (100mph) is a bit absurd. Yet on some occassions the cars felt good and some occassions the cars felt like boats. My fears before release became clear : Oh dear, Here we go with a yet another simcade game trying to be a simulator, but failing at trying to be one. I heard many players having the same opinion as me, yet I heard players who like it. And these kinds of people I like to categorise in : sim-racers and arcade-racers. I expected Project CARS to have similair car-physics as Assetto Corsa but what I felt was less than that. For arcade-racers to find a new challenge this is a game for you, for sim-racers like me it's a dissappointment.Graphics wise, the cars are sublime , nothing wrong with that, weather-effects the same thing. Tracks could've had some more love in the end.Despite this I nor hate or love the game. Every game has it's flaws , but this games has the flaws where I didn't want it to have them.   5/10 - It was promising but a let down after all the hype around it.---------------------------------New Section : Third day of playingThis is what I noticed over the third day of playing Project CARS.First of all lets start with the animations, I use with my G27 the H-pattern on the cars that have it, Nothing wrong with that? Well the animations of shifting seems first fine from neutral to first all is well, from first to etc. you see the animation going for neutral then being cut off and restarted for the animation to the selected gear which is annoying after a while and for me noticeable at the third day of looking through what is wrong. What is more wrong, is the rain effects on the front and side windows of the car, because if you want to implement rain you need also take notice of the windspeed and the speed of the car, because the flowing air makes the rain drops move in certain directions, as for the rain drops in pCARS they are static pretty much at whatever given speed.Next part about the rain drops involve the windscreen wipers, after the windscreen wipers cleaned an area and they go back in an up right position you see for half a second in light rain or a thunderstorm / heavy rain, that a certain is dry. Rather more than that is the water particles from the wheels as they go through the car model ( only seen in third person camera behind the car ). Further more some cars like the, BMW 1M or RUF RGT-8 do have incorrect engine sounds. So are more cars like that. There a few cars which I find driveable are the Renault Clio Cup car, the Aston Martin Vantage V12 GT3, the Ford Focus RS, the RUF RGT-8 despite the lack of a good engine sound. Trackwise, I drove a few laps around Sakito GP not sure if I said it right (Suzuka, a real track located in Japan) missed some corners, I don't know if this is done on purpose or not, there can be a reason which I or we don't know. Despite this I can find some fun in the game.Now for the online gameplay, it's well done with the lobby's and interfaces.But, the following was a HUGE let down for me, probably for others as well, after a while my steering wheel was no longer recognized and i had to force quit the game and restart the game, one of my friends had to restart his computer to get his wheel working again. After that we could play a nice round on Watkins Glen Short. The score of my rating stays the same, I won't lower it because it is already given.			"

												This review will be strange to some.  And dont be fooled by my ""hours"" on record.  It's more.  This is just what I accumulated with this install.Project Cars is in mnay ways the driving / racing sim everyone wanted.  Easy to pick up and hard to master.  But...SMS is not delivering what they promised.There were too many day 1 bugs...as if no-one quality checked it.  Then there are the many bugs that persists to this day...with most updates seemingly happily focused on ramming more DLC down our throats.One of the most annoying is how cars can just magically disappear from replay saves.  And dont get me started on the actual replay system.  It is truly horrendous.  And for a long time all of these things could be overlooked simply because the actual racing is so damn awesome.  But no more...not with it becoming clearer by the day that the developer is more concerned with pumping out DLC and planning a big UPDATE in the form of PC2 than they are with fixing a product people paid large amounts of money for.  It has this unethical flavor that just makes everything in my mouth bitter as hell.			"

												BUT WAIT.... this is the main motto of this game. I am a big motor head when it come to cars and racers. and when i saw this i said yes its finnaly here. But wait. Looks nice, the cars look very pollished and neat. in car looks to be real, idk dont own many of these cars. but it looks good enough for me, but wait the aspec in the car is lacking of any redefinment so your stuck with that postion. the drive is great all the phyics, but wait most cars feel like boxes with no real suspension in them at all, over steer and under steer has never been so big. cant tune it out and that if you know what to tune, no real guide for anything, carrear mode is cool all those division and all open but wait not all the divisions are open and the seasons seem formless race here race their then do it again. by the way you cant select the car you want you get the sponsor's car and the sponsors mean NOTHING not bonus or even diffrent voices in car. I love this Game but wait. it dissapoints but offer so much hope.			"

												A lot of the community whines about the drama with Project Cars, but they have made me happy with CV1 support at launch. They and Live for Speed have been able to keep up with the VR trend and I applaud it.There is a lot to like in Project Cars-CV1 support-Lots of great race cars-Lots of great race tracks-Beautiful graphics-Each car has a unique personalityThe not so good.-Suicidal AI. Prepare to be dive bombed, sideswiped, rear ended, and put into walls. Scarier than actual wheel to wheel road racing.-Pits, pit stops are a bit of a pain to manage, but I'm comparing it to iRacing.-Flags, the flags aren't really happening in a race. You can cheat your way to the top if you wish.-No ghost car during practice. One of my favorite things in Gran Turismo and iRacing is missing.			"

												Still one of the worst racegames to play with a controller. I've played Grand Prix Legends, rFactor and Assetto Corsa with a controller and all of those game handle it a thousand time better than Project Cars. (which released on consoles!) There is something wrong with the response curve of the joysticks in this game, which make every tiny movement in the center of the joystick too aggresive, but big movements to the outside of the joystick too slow. This is the only racegame I've ever played that has this problem and there is just no way to fix this.			"

												If you want a good sim, try Assetto Corsa or even RaceRoom Racing. Heck, even rFactor2. Project CARS is really good looking, and may work for arcade players who want a console-y feel for their game, but the force feedback is horrible, the cars feel floaty and the AI is so aggressive I can rarely finish a race without they ramming into me.tl;dr: not a bad game, but a bad sim.

												Don't mind the reviews, if you have a wheel and can read head over to projectcarsgame.com, check out the forum for tips on setting up the wheel to get the feel you desire. I prefer only feedback on what the steering rack provides, a GOOD pair of head phones comes in extremely handy. The sound in the game brings in the immersion, paying attention to the sounds is key to balancing the car.This is the only sim out there that i keep coming back to, not to mention the only one you can hop in and join an online race at anytime compared to the other games. I own AC, RRRE, The whol SimBin bunch, the immersion from this game just keeps me coming back. There is something about the feel and physics of the game that lends itself to be natural to me. The input and output feels like a car at least the road cars for the most part feel like my car. The EVO behaves like it does for me at AutoX and general track days. I can toss it like i would in real life, granted not as extreme, you know the whol its a game thing :) Can't just restart and have a shiny new car in less than a second...Regardless, you will read a lot of bickering about minor stuff, while i agree about some (safety car, proper flags, custom championships) even without it i get way to much joy out of driving this game. So many cars, so many tracks, so many combinations.At the end of the day, its about what feels best for you. Find a Sim that you agree with most and master it. I can't do AC or RRRE3 because of the wonky tires (instant grip loss on slip and its just like ice after that) and they feel like they are way to canned with the steering, like its guiding me rather than me driving. Meh, to each their own, take this review as you wish, but to me this is an amazing game i just hate the fact i missed the chance to be part of the dev process on Project CARS 2.			"

												Project Cars is, when all is said and done, a very middle of the road racing game.The physics are okay, the graphics are okay, the sound is on the poor side and the single player experience, despite first impressions, amounts to a very bare bones structure.Physics - Touted as stunningly realistic with ""best in class tyre model"", feel very muted. Even with all assists off it still feels as though all cars have some amount of traction and stability control enabled, the behavior of cars at low speed is weird and in most cars it's impossible to do a burnout as you can in any other simulator.Visually comma it's mostly just an okay looking game, in certain weather conditions and times of day it can look very impressive but it is not the photo realistic tour de force that it has been made out to be in promotional shots and various shill articles from around the internet. Sound, which in the lead up to release was touted as being one of the game's killer features is actually on the poor side. Engines sound clipped and distorted, which can be a cool effect, but in Project Cars sounds tinny and lacking oomph. Cockpit rattles, backfires and tyre squeal are serviceable but nothing exceptional.The AI in single-player is slow, even on the hardest difficulty, any competent racer will find that they don't put up much of a fight. They also have difficulty keeping off each other and it's not uncommon to find them all dog piled on top of each other on corners they find a bit tricky.The games true killer feature is the dynamic weather. Setting the weather to random is great fun and really adds something to the game that the other sims don't have. It's also during rain that the game engine really looks its best with terrific looking pools of water forming on the track and atmospheric lighting, it really makes for an immersive experience.Most troubling is the games current state in terms of stability and features. The game is supposed to have fully animated pit crews, but as of patch 2.0 this is still not in the game and who knows if it's actually going to be added. You also don't need to look very hard to find the plethora of bugs still present in the game, with cars absorbing into each other, flying into the air and falling through the track. The collision physics are also very odd. Touching another car seems to mute your steering, often causing both cars to just carry on off the track, sort of glued to each other. These issues combined with the announcement of Project Cars 2 along with it's funding campaign leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Project Cars is not a bad game, but it feels unfinished and even with the polish it needs, I am not confident it could match the single player experience offered by games like Stock Car Extreme and RaceRoom. If you are someone who enjoys weather effects and cares more about immersion rather than the racing, Project Cars will have something to offer. Otherwise, don't bother.			"

												[Quick points]=Pro's=- Good graphics, well optimized (AMD Phenom x2 810 2.6ghz, GTX 960 2gb, 4gb Ram)- Excellent netcode- Good selection of cars at launch- Quick and easily joinable multiplayer races- Can add AI to multiplayer races=Con's=- Not a true simulator, more of a Grid-esque semi realistc hybrid.- Car sounds are not very good at all (A V8 in a flat six Porsche 911?)- Very uningaging FFB- Bad sense of speed (when going 160mph, it still looks like your travelling at 50mph)- CPU hungry singleplayer racing with AI- Terrible AI (overly aggressive and no regard for players positioning)While Project Cars is not an actual simulator at all (dissapointing i know), it's still a pretty fun and rather pretty looking game.The FFB is a bit wonky, the cars do feel rather 'floaty' but after my first race, i was rather suprised to see how smoothand well made the netcode was. I've not played a racing game online so lacking in netcode issues since LFS.30 cars on track in a multiplayer race. Not a single lagging car.While this is to be expected, there's been so many new games out in recent times with issue's all over the place. Racing games in general need to have extended work done when it comes to the netcode, and its a breath of fresh air to just be able to jump in and play.I particularly like that you can add AI cars in multiplayer races.It's a feature that should be on all racing games, especially since a lot of sims out there, do actually have good AI, unforunately though, this doesn't.Being a Sim racing nut, I do tend to critique a racing games sound a lot.I've been all over the country visiting various racetracks, watching countless different types of race meetings from Group C cars to BTCC and  the World endurance Championship.In other words, i know how the majority of the cars provided in the games should sounds, and while theres a good 2 or 3 which do a reasonable job, most of them are a bit 1995 in quality and some cars have completely the wrong type of engine sound.TL:DRA solid game worth picking up for a quick race.Theres not a lot of depth, no unlocks to aim for, no customization, but its a great pick up 'n' play racer.Don't expect the next best Racing Sim either, It's not remotely a simulator, but its great for a quick bit of fun and it's simple to play.

												Woot!   I bought Project Cars the day it came out with Vive Support.   It doesn't dissapoint, I'm an old time gamer from the 80's, many many racing games from Atari 8 bit computer, Atari ST, to IBM PCs for the last 20 years.  I even had the Act Labs Steering wheel and gate shifter back in the day.  I kind of lost interest in racing games with a single monitor, but Project Cars with Vive support has changed that.   I feel like a kid again, and racing in VR is glorious, no need for tripple monitors!  Love it! Oh and I'm using a Force GT steering wheel/pedals on a Wheel Stand Pro.

												Some games will give you thousands of hours game play satisfaction, action and fun for a fraction of the price of this.  At £39.99  for the initial Game + £40.09 for DLCs  bringing the grand total to £80.08 for a f**king average game I think its safe to say that this game for me is way over priced and certainly not worth the money I paid. I've done more hours on old rfactor and SIMBIN titles for a fraction of the price, with more fun and community content than this game can ever give me and thats whilst already owning this game.  Its a good game, but its definately not worth the £80.08 (Euro 102.84 / $115.88) that you will have to pay for the full game including DLCs.			"

												[50 hours in game] Ugh ""Project Cars"" will be known as the biggest racing game flop in history.  EVEN with the limited edition pack you barely get any cars without buying DLC and their mostly European!  I mean sure there are plenty of Fords but how can you flat out ignore the other great manufactures out there?  I'm really surprised project cars has not learned from GT6 that players actually like driving cars from their favorite manufacturer?  Also a real killer is the fact that there is ZERO customization for the cars, you cant even change the paint color which seems essential.  When they say ""we listened to what the players wanted"" they really do not mean that, I cant see a single player actually wanting only 30 (I know i may be off a bit) cars to chose from.  The only pro I have with Project cars is the graphics, which can STILL be horrible it does not matter what monitor or GPU you have, textures will still be tearing everywhere and if your CPU is not top of the line it will still be imposible to play agianst any AI.  Just get GT6 guys or GT7 if their making it (I do realize its a console game but seriously, its better than this ♥♥♥♥ and this is coming from a strongly PC oriented player).			"

												So here we are ..playing the DayZ of racing games.. so much potentioal ..such bed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (over promise and under deliver)All things said ..if you like getting in a car and gong for a rip , maybe with some friends, this game nails it. My friends and I have had a lot of fun just messing around in this game....BUT the fun literaly stops there. At a $60.00 entery point I have to give this game a thumbs down.As far a visuals go this game looks awesome. I run an AMD card and have no trouble at all with this game. Racing in the rain/fog is a lot of fun and looks stunning, the helmet cam is awesome( cheating yourself if you dont use it). The attention to detail for this part of the game is really top notch , project cars in that regards rival's the big boy's ( Gran Tourismo, Asseto Corsa....and so on )Then there's the rest..or rather the lack there of,  hence the odd feeling of being stoked to play a game and at the same time thinking ... I wish I had spent money on F1 2012 or 2013..or Asseto Corsa....or givin it to that homeless guy with the twitchy eye who hangs out behind the Wendy's on Main St. "

												All style, no substance. It looks nice. It’s clear this was the focus of the developers as every 2nd race takes place at dusk for no other reason than to show off the graphics at the expense of the gameplay.The AI is HORRIBLE. The worst AI I have ever seen. They spend more time off the track than on, and have no clue what to do when your car is near them, they either drive straight into you, or clean off the track to avoid you.The handling is mixed, between “okay” and “terrible”. I’m a sim racer using a wheel. My first race was in a hot hatch that kept losing the back end somehow every time I lifted off the throttle. I spent ages recalibrating, trying driving aids, but couldn’t solve it. That level of simulation would embarrass Sega Rally. Occasionally you find a car that handles okay and you see what this game could have been.The racing is flawed. You can massively cut corners and chicanes, overtaking dozens of cars. The annoying team radio guy tells you the stewards will “pull you off” if it happens again. I haven’t been disqualified, penalised, or pulled off by any stewards while playing this game.			"

												Very polemic title. Thumbs down inbound.>> Break of recomendation levels on the bottom of the review if you don't want to read it. <<Early in the release of PC I have to say that I didn't looked at it with good eyes. All the polemic involved plus the promisses of a ultimate sim not delivered, and the shaddy community behavior towards helpfull and ocasionaly heavyhanded reviews in the fervorous and niche community as it is racing SIMULATORS.OK, leaving that stuff behind. Let's pretend that shaddy ♥♥♥♥ didn't happen.Cool game!Graphics are excelent, but in some areas you can see some glitches and insconsistencies with the advertised screenshots, but overall, amazing!Gameplay:I'm not going to talk about handling or physics on project cars, it's a can of worms.I have no Steering wheel at the moment (for years now :c), so i'm playing with a 360 controller and for adrenaline sake, no assists.Gameplay wise is good if you're into real world kind of racing and not Need For Speed or other generic ones I shall not name. AI is quite insane some times but not as crazy as some users claim to be: HAVE AWARENESS! They are fierce to get positions and the great majority of my crashes with them were my fault (seen the replay)You can do championships as far as I know in career mode and some ppl have a lot of fun there I guess, but I'm the lose races kind of guy atm. Some 15 to 30 minutes races do for me.CARS:The game have a ton of cars and all kinds, not Gran Turismo library size, but the thing here is racing and not looking at 3000+ cars that can handle the same sometimes.No assists play, as I am doing, every car so far feel unique BUT some does not feel realistic with tyre behavior and have some hardcoded stability assists. Some other just don't feel good to drive, those are very few in my experience.Some cars are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing to drive and make up for every other that doesn't feel right.Sounds: The engine sounds are pretty crappy. Extreme digital feel on them and not enough bass on recordings/mixing. Take RaceRoom game for a reference of mindblowing engine sounds.Multiplayer: I've seen a lot of lobbies full of people and making a custom race seems effortless (yet to do soon). Stability on MP info, you should google that or see in other reviews. I have no experience in MP as of now.OVERALL: Very nice racing game on the simulation side. Great track library, missing just some famous tracks here and there (famous: Interlagos, and ovals)I'd recomend this full price if you have nothing else to wait to release or play as race SIMI'd recomend this ON SALE to...anybody, really. Even if you're a Simulation only machine head, this game can give some relaxing arcadey little races here and there and for people who wants some simulation arcadeish yet challenging experience with cool graphics.I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS TO: players who are dedicated only to racing simulation and looking for something else other than iRacing in the same level of fidelity. This is not on the same level of fidelity. You will get frustrated.Personal recomendation observation: Get it on sale. The folks who made this game are already making the sequel and all this sequel ♥♥♥♥ moneygrab industry is crap. They could just update the game and make current players happy.			"

												This game is more of a dissapointment, than a bad game. The lack of content really bugs me. I will say the game is solid graphics are good. The sound however is terrible, and always glitchty, and that really robs the immerision. The fake social media like menu is another thing that shouldnt be there at all.To keep this short if you enjoy playing from time to time doing hot laps everyonce in a while than this game is for you. But if you are looking for a hardcore sim racing experince i would look elese where like Asseotto Corsa. Even though that game has issues, its in game content and moding comunity is huge and immersive compared to project carsI dont hate this game and i wish there was a mixed button, but i wouldnt recomened it to everyone.

												With how the developers of this game seemingly moved on to Project CARS 2 so shortly after this was released (they were crowdsourcing for PCars 2 barely a week after PCars 1 first launched), I feel like that I paid full price to do their beta testing the whole time I played this game. The game remained fairly buggy after numerous patches, and during my time with the game, any criticism on the PCars forums was commonly met with hostility from the game's supporters and occassionally a banhammer.While I like the variety of cars and tracks that Project CARS 1 has to offer, the toxicity of the community and its developers don't give me much hope for PCars 2 whenever that comes to fruition.

												If you've been waiting for a racing game for your Vive look no further than Project Cars. Vive support has now officially been added! I wouldn't say this is a 100% sim racer and it's definitely not a arcade racer. It fits comfortably in the middle of those two. The biggest disappointment when it comes to playing this in the Vive is the resolution. It is the first game I've played in VR that it stuck out like a sore thumb. Hopefully the next few generations of Vive improve on this. Happy racing!			"

												At the moment, Project CARS isn't an absolute failure, but I feel my money could have been more well spent. Short review, TLDR form:EDIT: Changed some words and opinions after re-playing with sufficient sleep. <3Pros:-Amazing car graphics-Finally, a nice-ish damage model-Variable weather-Oh the list of cars is fantastic. Cons:-Physics are varied - overall they need improvement, but some cars more so than others (looking at you, Lykan).-Tracks are not as detailed as some of the game's peers (esp. Nordschelife).-Very little sensitivity and feedback - I don't feel like I'm in control. -Sounds are bad. Definitely needs improvement. At times it's muffled, at times it hurts, and some cars sound off (a C9 should not sound like it revs to 9000...).I suggest SMS and WMD put a hold on the weekly car release thing that they have planned and focus more on fixing the physics and the sounds first. It would make this game more fun than a wrestling match with my Zonda Cinque whose rear wheels have read too much Orwell and want to break free of my control.			"

												I want to recommend this game because some of the cars feel amazing, the tracks are beautiful, and occasionally you get an amazing online race. The content, however, is lacking.  Career mode(single player) is entirely inconsequential with no unlocks, money, or achievement.  This makes it go stale quickly(for a gran turismo fan like myself).  Where it goes worse is the online races(which are arguably the main reason to get this game).  In Pacific Standard Time there are about 15 - 50 players online at a time spread across multiple lobbies.  Finding a good race takes a lot of time investment, only for a bunch of turn one wrecks by dive bombers and rammers.  It's rare that a race actually goes cleanly and well(though so satisfying when it does).  It's the low player count that hinders it the most.*This being said... I do enjoy how most of the cars feel(especially the Mclaren mp4-12c GT3 car) and have had some EPIC races, but the experience is very inconsistent			"

												I bought this game when I read the recommendations of this game. Graphic is simply the best I ever saw in racing games, but... Handling of cars is really, really terrible. Overstearing in almost every corner, validating times is some almost impossible think, if you run through the corner and due to really overstearing thing in this game, you just a little miss the outside way of the corner and time is not validated, omg why???? (not talking about inside of the corner, thats understandable when you shorten the corner that the time is not validated). This game is really not worth the money, it is pain to focus all the time and even when you focus, cars behave like nothing real. I have really bad car in my real life, but I can run through any corner in real life at higher speed than in this game and comparing the stearing at low speed has nothing to do with real simulation. I like realism, but not unreal realism, this game could be more fun with arcade stearing exept of trying to make something real.			"

												Sadly Project CARS does not live up to its own hype and expectations created when the game was first relaesed.There are still many unfixed issues which the devs and community said would get fixed but didn't. It all looks like a bit of a cash grab from the developers now, they claimed that starting work on pCARS 2 would not affect the continued support of pCARS 1 but that is simply not the case, many 'features' (I would call them requirements) like triple screen support were supposed to be implimented and are all of a sudden going to be in pCARS 2 instead (except this info was only 'shared' on a post within the forum, same as a lot of the ommissions and back tracking the devs have done since release), all while they still churn out monthly paid DLC. The patches are getting smaller and smaller with less fixes which proves they are no longer working on the core of the game, which is still a mess in places.I'm glad I never put money into pCARS 2 as I can see the devs playing the same cash grab scam as the first, promised the world, released it broken, patched it to a beta state, don't mention all the stuff that they are not going to impliment, let time go on so that people who invested good money into it don't feel so sore about it then slowly leak the fact that your not going to deliver what was advertised, nice strategy.This game has some good points about it, there is a big if bland career mode, and the driving model is nice but the lack of ability to save more than 1 set up for a car (seriously this was achievable back in days of the Amiga, it's 2016 FFS), dodgy collision physics, odd wet weather tyre behavour (especially the AI, this has been 'fixed' apparently yet still exists in certain circumstances), no real multi-class racing (hey look we have prototype 1 and 2 and GT3, but were not going to let you race them together because clearly our game engine can't cope with it) which ruins the career progression for me in this regard, very inconsistent AI meaning you never run at the front with the same guys race to race (this is again shocking, Amiga racers had this, c'mon), no custom championships (yes another staple of most early 90's racing games seems impossible in 2016 for SMS) along with a plethora of small niggly little bugs and issues that culminate to make the experience one of frustration rather than fun.My advise, wait to see what pCARS 2 produces, do not buy it on release, read the forums (don't for heaven sake post there, especially with anything less than wishing to suck the balls of the developer or you will probably get banned) and see if they are capable of producing a sim that lives up to even half the hype they surround it in.

												This is maybe my new FAVORITE RACING SIM. (Aside from Gran Turismo being my favorite Sim series) I use Project cars for Time Trials, Curcuits, Sprints, and Endurance Races. Project Cars has the biggest track selection i've ever seen in a racing game/sim. When setting up a race, you are able to edit and adjust numerous setting and features for that race. Time and Weather can both be set at a fixed position or can be set to have multiple different weather and time changes that occure during the race. EX: You can have the race start during the day and end when its night time, as well as having a rain storm swoop over the track for a specific amount of time. The combinations are endless.Each car can be tuned individually, as well as your STEERING WHEEL SETTINGS! Thats right, you can apply different force-feedback settings for each vehicle.Ai is another story, for the most part the Ai is fantastic and always races with a mix of lenience and aggression. Some Ai will drive as if they struggle with the track, struggle with the car, or just flat out suck ♥♥♥ at driving in general, and other Ai can be as agressive as kid on Forza trying to ruin your tandem drift. Thus meaning they are very well at keeping their racing line and following it, they not afraid to slip by if you give them too much room, and near the end of a race they might try to make some last resort moves in order to take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. *Im gonna give a detailed example of one gripe I have about the Ai:- When overtaking someone on either the outside or inside, you would know to respect eachothers racing line and try to keep it as clean as possible. Well I had an incedent where I was doing a 30 Lap race at Bathurst and I was in 3rd, about to take 2nd. We both we coming up into a left hand corner and I happened to take the inside line, but he was at my same pace yet on the outside line. I went to turn into the corner, keeping my side of the lane, and then out of nowhere instead of the Ai keeping his outside line to make the corner clean, he just turns into the inside like a freight train and takes us both out. In the real world this wouldn't have happened, but what can you do its a game/sim anyways. Thats really my only gripe about it, yet it only happens every so often. And not to only me, Ai will do this to other Ai and create collisions and pile ups.On the other hand, Project Cars is still a must buy!!			"

												This games engine is just bad, plain and simple. If you plan on using a controller, do not buy this. If you have a wheel setup, bare in mind that this game has overly complicated settings to the point of being annoying as you have to adjust steering ratio for every car. Correcting oversteer is near impossible, and wheel spin will randomly shoot you sideways with no feedback prior.			"

												I reviewed this title when it first launched with pretend VR support. Lets fast forward all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that happened inbetween with the constant glitches, bugs and horrible dev responses. Lets look at Official Oculus Rift launch day. This was ment to be an Oculus rift launch title. Well, it is. However, they've completely forgotten about their original backers and earlier adpoters by forcing them to buy the entire game again ($91aud) or buying all of the DLC ($65aud) to get a key to the Oculus version of pCars. The only other options are to stay on 0.8sdk. What kind of options are these? This type of greed is not acceptable to backers or early adopters or anyone for that matter. What about VIVE launch you say? Well that launches early April. With SMS not even making an attempt to respond to this very question countless times, I think it's safe to say VIVE support will be screwed or non existent come launch day. From what I've read, I could only imagine Oculus trying to run 1.3 through STEAM VR to be a horrible experience and resource hungry.Now add these issues ontop of the 12 months worth of issues (some of which are still not fixed) + Ian Bell abusing people with any sort of criticism then banning them.. Or abusing them for reporting bugs, Google it and be amazed at how someone responds to his own backers....and you then ask yourself, will you support SMS with pCars 2? Or any other title? No chance will they ever get a cent off of me. Never. ♥♥♥♥ing. Again.			"

												AMD FX 835032gb64bit win 10OCZ SSD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970Thrustmaster TX wheelLooks awesome with a huge unplayable BUT...Running this game with everything in graphics hardware set to LOW and including dropping the resolution to 1920 x 1200 i still get severe graphics lag ending up with me crashing out on corners because of this. Unplayable for me so going to stick to other racing titles until theres a fixI have no issues like this in any other games i ownUPDATE: went back to try this again and with my pc rig havving had no hardware changes something has changed for the better... it plays a lot better so some patch must have sorted a few issues? i can manage about 5-10 cars before i get the micro stutter effect happening so i keep under that and i dropped my graphics to mid which is still way better than any other racers graphic content :)All in all im well happy now and after my next pc upgrade ill get to try it at ultra settings. Lovving the create server options!!!			"

												Project cars was one of those game i looked forward to to replace the my old growing up days of playing grand torismo yes i understand this is on a different level but at the same time both P.C. and G.T. are more realistic than Need For Speed. The game was fun at first but then it just got boring between the people in multiplayer who take the game way to seroiusly or the ones who are straight up a holes but hey its a sim game i get it and hey its multiplayer gaming i get it but single palyer is only so fun for so long.Would i reccomend this game, yes if your willing to play it and get good at it because it takes timeIf you just want a game were you can race and stuff but dont want to have to deal with the bad things id say just get need for speed or somthing along those lines.

												Came from Assetto Corsa, played for a while and got a refund. The career mode seems fine enough, but the actual driving just feels dishonest and too artificial. The physics don't feel reliable, despite being much more accurate than something like Forza. I think what really let me down is that Project Cars just feels like a game whereas Assetto Corsa feels like a simulator. I think it comes down to presentation and driving feel, because the physics in Project Cars seem alright.Tl;dr  -   If you are coming from Assetto Corsa, Project Cars' Career mode is not enough to make it worth while and the physics are not up to par.

												Before you read the rest of this i am going to make a bold statement! BETTER THAN FORZA AND GRAN TURISMO!!! Yes that is an OPINION please don't hunt me down.---------------------------------------- The Review -----------------------------------------If i wrote this review about 8 or 9 months ago, my recommendation to you would be leave this game alone at all costs and save your money! Now however i can say the opposite; throw all your cash at this game (there are no micro-transactions, don't worry.)I bought this game on first release, i had been looking forward to the game hoping that it would be a PC rival to Forza Motorsport. Sadly on release i was disappointed by endless bug, optimisation issues and gruesome GUI screens. You start the game driving Go Karts which is great to teach you the basic mechanics of the game, you then progress upwards onto harder difficulty vehicles with the game occasionally throwing you a cheeky challenge race with some Million Horse-Power monster. The original issue was that after you stopped driving Go Karts and went onto full sized vehicles, the game became dramatically unstable and would leave you with a game just coping at 20FPS (on low settings!!!)I might point out my computer isn't weak it has a GTX 780 which still packs one hell of a punch.Now for the bit you were waiting to read, because you are sat there wondering why this game has a thumbs up and so far all i've done is moan about it.The game is now, on writing this, in version 7. All of the optimsation issues have gone (on Nvidea Cards) and the game handles and soothes every driving style possible.There are a great selection of tracks! From the favourites to the ones you've never heard. Cars i would argue are a bit lacking, this could be due to my current progression level in the game, however on selecting quick race i still don't see many cars.Don't let that put you off though! Although there are limited cars, they do leave you feeling satisfied after a race and don't make you wish you chose another car because it has big flames on the bonnet.The career system seems to have improved also with a far clearier understanding of what you are actually progressing towards.My biggest issue with the game is, the still horrible, GUI. The menu system is like working your way through a maze of horror; left does not mean left all the time and the same for right, before you know it the selection has gone upwards and you are sat there feeling frustrated because it's taken so damn long to click one box. Whoever designed that UI i do hope your on a good training course now cause by god who let you get that through Quality Control.To sum up, the game is now fantastic with its small niggle of GUI horror. The gameplay is smooth, fun and leaves you feeling satisfied that the driving you did was your driving and not a military GPS system guiding you every step of the way (although those options are available, except for the military GPS thing.)

												I love this game, I have logged many, many, many hours in it with my Logitech G27, G930 and Oculus Rift DK2 and I'm so very pleased to see it's available for everyone now.I have seen many comparisons between it and Assetto Corsa and rightly so as they are both Racing Sims and very good ones at that but it irks me a little when I read about how Assetto Corsa is much better as IMHO it's not.Neither game is perfect, no game is but I prefer the car handling in Project Cars, I prefer the Force Feedback in Project Cars, I prefer the Sound in Project Cars, I prefer the DK2 implementation in Project Cars, I prefer the Graphics in Project Cars, I prefer the Joypad control in Assetto Corsa but the launch build of Project cars seems to have evened that out.Overall Project Cars is an amazing game that needs more polish, specifically VR Menu's have to happen for a start. However I only play it in the DK2 so it's definately not a deal breaker.I really like Assetto Corsa, I've had great fun in multiplayer (Which is an absolute disgrace to set up a server and HOST a multiplayer event, Project Cars really does it MUCH better, no messing around with external servers, Router settings, IP forwarding, or whatever other torture Assetto Corsa inflicts.Both of these games are officially released but IMHO Project Cars is the game that feels like it, Assetto Corsa feels really rough around the edges and should have been delayed until it was finished. I did buy the Dream Pack and am happy with it but not so happy that it fragments the multiplayer even more than it already was, you can't join a session if there is even a single car that you don't have in it, rather than just letting you join and not be able to pick that vehicle, how dumb is that?

												I like it. The graphics are sharp looking. The AI seems dumb and a little cheap. This is not GT or Forza. The car selection is smaller and their is no opening up of new cars or adding engine parts to cars. There is a career mode. The Go karts are fun to drive. The game has a ton of camera options. The game does have a lot of tracks. Fun game overall.			"

												I honestly can't recommend this for ATI owners... The problems that existed at launch still linger, with the game suffering severe framerate issues even with rather conservative settings applied. If I ignore all that, there's something that could be fun hidden beneath - though it requires players to be patient and invested in authenticity over the more immediate action of competitors like Forza. In the end I've come away feeling like this whole 'needing to practice and qualify before a race' thing just isn't for me, and it seems a shame that the game doesn't offer a slightly more streamlined approach to the career mode for players who just want to experience the main events. You can manually skip to the main races, but it hamstrings you, putting you at the back of the grid each time. In the end I just got bored.Perhaps my view has been skewed by the frustration I've felt spending hours fiddling with graphics settings and drivers, and maybe the smoother experience on offer for nvidia players will genuinely lead to more fun, engaging play sessions. Alas, the experience I've had has not been worth the investment (in money  or  time). I only hope Slightly Mad stop blaming AMD for their QA problems and do a better job next time.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. There are some moments where it's the best racing game on the market....then you run into one of the lengthy list of bugs/UI quirks/questionable design decisions that plague this game.Their forums are a toxic environment as well. You list the bugs/issues and you either get your posts deleted, comments from backers saying that these issues aren't bugs/dont effect anyone else, or you just get flat out banned without reason.Oh and don't expect the issues to be patched out as they've announced they're already working on the sequel which even though they sold over a million copies of pCars 1, is going to be crowdfunded yet again.

												ENGLISH;I hyped this game like I never did othersI waited this game so long that sometimes I forgot that it will come out one day.I expected a realistic drive.I got a simcade one.I expected a developer who won't spam DLCs from day 1.We already have 8 DLCs after 6 months. They are already surpassed the price of main game combined.I'd recommend this game but I won't.Why?I HATE DLC SPAMS.TÜRKÇE;Oyunu yıllarca bekledik bekledik durduk. Hatta kimi zaman oyunun çıkacağını / yapım aşamasında olduğunu bile unuttuk.Bu oyunu çok destekledim gerek forumlarda gerek arkadaş çevremde. PC platformu için böyle bir oyunun , FORZA ve GT ile yarışması için gerekli olduğunu düşünüyordum. Oyun genel olarak NFS : Shift 3 diyebiliriz. Az daha dayanabilir bir fizik motoru ve oynanış sunuyor.Normal şartlarda oyunu tavsiye ederdim. Çünkü şu anda Assetto Corsa'dan başka rakibi yok. Ancak tavsiye etmememin sebebi kesinlikle indirilebilir içeriklerin çok hızlı ve fazlaca çıkması. 6 ay gibi bir süreç geçmesine rağmen 8 tane paket geldi. Bu paketler tabiki güzel ancak bu kadar yıldır geliştirilmiş bir oyunun içinde bazı ekollerin ve ikon arabaların olmaması bence çok komik bir durum. İşte tam bu noktada bence oyun yapımcısının daha sonra indirilebilir içerik olarak satmayı göze alması yatıyor. Zaten 2015 Mayıs ayında çıkan bir oyunu 2015 Haziran ayında %40-50 indirime çekiyorsun ondan sonra insanları tahrik etmek için ayda birden fazla indirilebilir içerik çıkartıyorsun. Şu anda 8 paketin toplam fiyatı çok rahat bir şekilde oyun fiyatına yetişiyor. Yani bir oyun parasıda ekstradan sahip olmak istediğiniz 3-5 arabaya veriyorsunuz.Oyunu tavsiye etmeme sebebim budur. Yoksa oyunla ilgili ne grafiksel bir sıkıntı , ne optimizasyonsal bir problem veyahut ne de motorsal bir sıkıntı yaşamadım.İndirimdeyse alın ancak onun dışında sakına tam fiyattan satın almayın. Benim gibi araçlardan hoşlanan biriyseniz alamadığınız her paket , her araç size kötü hissiyatlar yaşatacaktır.			"

												very good racing sim. has best graphics ive seen in a racing game.Good points:1. how realistic the racing i/2. how the rain drops on the windscreen and how over the period the track can get completly wet and changes the whole impact of the race/3. dynamic weather, first it could be nice and sunny, then it can get foggy and rain, then the sun comes out and the track stays wet till it drys out.4. how the cars handle. this is most impressive5. this racer makes you feel like winning the race isnt just important. that finishing out the podium places is an acheivement like it is in real racing.6. the amount of tracks are amazing.7. the career is really worth playing as it offers someting never seen in any over racing game.8. the old stig as your driving instructer.9. saw paul walker in one of my races think thats a nice touch/ 10. how it makes you feel as your really there.Bad points:1. controller feels out of place and i dont recomend this without a steering wheel. but is still fun with a controller if you balence the settings to your liking but still feels slugish.2. the car list isnt too inpressive, but with free cars over time this should improve. hope to see more licences soon. 3. no nissan gtr ;( not even a gt3 gtr or prototype. not one japennesse car maker. and hardley any american. i hope this changes.4. go karting is fun but can become un intresting as the handling not too great.but overall this game is very good. i would score this an 89/100 must buy for a car and racer lover.

+ Very emersive realistic experience+ Visually the game looks amazing with a great amount of detail inside and out of the Cars, dynamic weather, great use of lighting and reflection, etc.  + Many camera views, UI options, and even has VR-Support (which is probably amazing if you have a VR headset)+ The sounds are incredibly life-like. It's especially neat that the way you hear things changes when you go in and out of helmet cam.+ A great variety of cars+ Go Kart Racing which I found extremely fun, especially for casual players+ 8 Tiers / Types of events with different cars to race. + Arrows on the track which help indicate where to go, and when to slow down.~ The game overall tries to be very realistic / simulator-like making the game have a high learning curve especially with the faster cars. - No real sense of reward or sense of progression for winning races. Unlike other racing games you do NOT earn money to save up for new cars or parts. Instead everyone seems to be on an even playing field each and every race with the same type of car, and after you win a few races you get a trophy. - Lacks customization options (paint, logo, etc.)- Going slightly off track, hitting a wall, going backwards, or hitting another player can get you instantly disqualified or your lap time nullified. This can be very annoying during the more challenging events as it can be sometimes hard to stay on track while racing full speed with a jet engine.			"

												This is a very good game if you like the anally retentive levels of detail in the handling physics. - also, there are two types of player, a highly dedicated, practised player who will use racing lines, avoid at all costs body contact and congratulate you on a win, OR the local town fool who take great pleasure in pretending he is in some sort of death race, and stop at nothing to see you rage quit or smash your vehicle into 1.675 trillion (approx) seperate pieces. may the odds be ever in your favour.

For starters, everything you hear about the AI being terrible is true. They drive as if you car is not there. Overtake someone going into a corner? Be prepared to get launched into space at corner exit by an AI. In addition, the crash physics are ridiculous. One little tap and off you go flying into the barrier. Lastly, there are graphical glitches that make the cockpit cam of some cars almost unusable.

												I was so excited for this game but I am disappointed by Steam and Project Cars. Experienced the game crashing after completing events and a multitude of bugs and issues. The career mode is buggy. I signed to a kart racing team but I end up racing Porches and forced only to race certain events? Even starting a career involved me leaving the game and tracking down a message board to find the steps to even begin the career mode. Multiplayer is full of children to just want to drag race each other or crash me out. The servers are almost all empty except for the children messing around. I was promised a real racing game and ended up with a buggy game I dont want to play. I tried for a refund but since I was passed the 2 hour limit (way too short to find bugs and issues with multiplayer, come the f@#ck on). I understand it was my job to know the limits of the refund policy. So.. Im stuck with a game I dont want to play and a lesson learned from Steam (vote with your dollars and choose a better platform). It will be a very long time before I come back to buy another game from this publisher and steam.			"

												Guided, tested, and approved by a passionate community of WMD members and real-life drivers who are paid to say good things, Project CARS represents the next-generation of racing simulation as the ultimate combination of WMD fan boys and developer arrogance/rudeness.Discover an unrivaled immersion fuelled by above average graphics and simcade handling that allows you to truly not feel the road. Create a driver which is your name pulled off steam, pick from a huge variety of motorsports in a simplistic career mode and write your own tale in empty or crash-fest online multiplayer.Featuring the largest track roster of any recent racing game giving quantity over quality with a scripted time of day & weather system, buggy tuning & pit stop functionality with terrible UI, and no support for 3 screens or current version of Oculus Rift, Project CARS trails the competition in their dust.

Short Review At bottom !Project CARS Is a intriguing Racer! Having Had it from Launch I Have encountered many Problems, At first the audio was horrible on all cars and the menu music didn't fit (Opera).The handiling of the cars was next and this was a crucial test because a bad handling system for a racing game isn't really a racing game. Lots of the cars are very twitchy and uncontrollable but others handle lovely and make a nice racing game (GT3,Formula A) just some of my favourites. When I first had it there wasn't much going for it that made me like the game besides stunning graphics. After a few patches and trying the game with a G25 wheel,I've Grown more than fond to it but I now love the game! There are still some game braking bugs but most of those are online.The Cars handiling Grows on you as you get used to it.TheTrack list is decent with many variations and variety from Racetracks to A-B Roads.The Audio has had some fixes and some of the cars sound a bit better but are still a little bit ""tinny"" And the Menu music is still opera.The Graphics are stunning with Rain decreasing FPS but the map looking lovely!  Bugs and a few game designs bring it down sadly,Sticking every style racing game in one doesn't work like it should.The game has many hours of fun to be played with a long career and many hours of fun online! there's much to do and many cars and tracks giving the game a good variation.With PCARS 2 on the way I hope it fixes and solves the issues PCARS has.A Great All round racer I recommend To Anyone who likes racing, hardcore or the casual! 90/100			"

												Guided, tested, and approved by a passionate community of WMD members and real-life drivers who are paid to say good things, Project CARS represents the next-generation of racing simulation as the ultimate combination of WMD fan boys and developer arrogance/rudeness.Discover an unrivaled immersion fuelled by above average graphics and simcade handling that allows you to truly not feel the road. Create a driver which is your name pulled off steam, pick from a huge variety of motorsports in a simplistic career mode and write your own tale in empty or crash-fest online multiplayer.Featuring the largest track roster of any recent racing game giving quantity over quality with a scripted time of day & weather system, buggy tuning & pit stop functionality with terrible UI, and no support for 3 screens or current version of Oculus Rift, Project CARS trails the competition in their dust.

												Cars do not react the way you expect them with controller or keyboard (don’t know about wheel, I haven’t got one) once you start turning it won’t stop unless you turn the other way, and then it sometimes does not do it so you never know how to handle the car during a corner. Also if you hit some dirt with can drag your car all the way into it with extreme force, even if you use full steering locking in the other dircetion. And finally if you hit a bump at high speed you seem to go flying even though aerodynamics (especially with the high end cars) should hold you to the ground. Other than that I think they have got something going here just needs these things sort especially the dirt problem then I would recommend this to others.			"

												I can't recommend this anymore, it just became far too frustrating to enjoy thoroughly. You'll basically spend most of your time resetting events because the AI drivers are more skilled at demolition derbys.I really wanted this game to get better. More variations in classes and performance tuning would be key. Knowing that's not likely to happen just scraps all reason to continue playing as the progression is pointless. Why bother when you get the same thrills from a non-career race such as practice or quick race?The game does have its high points in sound and visual presentation, the enjoyment is just a little dry.

												Even after Patch 5.0 it is unfinished. Carreer mode is dull. The AI is extremely bad - even after 5 patches they just ram people off. And once you are in front they cant keep a good speed even at maximum difficulty. Game looks good. But that is not a reason to give it a positive review. The tires still heat unnormally because they are not simulated. They do an overhaul now, but when you promise realistic tires then you better not only come up with that in patch 6.0.			"

												Good racing game. Graphics are good. Pity about the AI in the game. AI seem to be a bit blind and race very ""aggressively "" and tend to shunt you out the way. Bit dumb. Is it worth the price at this moment? No. Its not for the hard core race gamer. It is however good for a laugh and some fun. I was hoping for a bit more technical and indepth play. Unfortunately not. AI spoil the game, and the lack of any ""modification"" leaves the game a bit empty. You just race, thats all. Maybe best to wait for price to drop.			"

												This game is broken, deeply broken and I do not think it will be fixed. There are issues from menu bugs all the way to physics bugs that make this almost unplayable. Issues like rain tires being faster on a dry track than dry tires, or issues where the setup menu offers a certain compound of tire and then the pitstop menu simply has, ""Hard, Medium and Soft."" There are also some very odd psychic behaviors especially with the cars over bumps. Some of the cars are undriveable, look up the McLaren F1. Unfortunately it took me several hours of gameplay, frustration and then googling to realize that it wasn’t me, it wasn’t the learning curve, simply the game is bad. The studio has said it’s reached, “the end of development” with this title, but they clearly never begun. It’s embarrassing, it’s worse than a Beta version and it’s pathetic it’s being allowed for sales.Bottom Line:I was very excited about this game, totally sold on the hype and I feel ripped off. Thankfully I bought it on sale, but don't make the same mistake I did, stay away! Unfortunately, by the time I realized just how horrible this game was, I was well past the number of play hours allowed by Steam and was refused a refund. I still want my money back!			"

												It's been four months since release, and nearly a half decade since development began and this game is still not in an entirely playable state.  Pit glitches make endurance racing impossible, career glitches prevent advancement despite dominating the respective class, broken AI laptimes, bizarre physics glitches, and most egregious of all my T300RS is less playable with each update.  The only decent thing about this game is the graphics engine which is very well optimized for nVidia cards.  I've struggled to derive any enjoyment from this glorified beta and SMS's priorities and conduct instill zero confidence.  I regret spending $50 on this at release, and wouldn't recommend it at any price over $15.			"

												It's not a bad game, it runs superbly well on my machine. 4th gen i7 @4.2ghz, 16gb RAM and a GTX970. The AI is irriating, stupid and unrealistic. Online works well if you have some friends that drive properly, most lobbys have at least 2 fools who think it's fun to play dodgems. Graphically the game is lovely, love the fact you can have 40+ multiclass cars on the track. The sounds of the cars is not bad at all, engine notes are captured very well but tyre noises aren't that realistic at least from experience of being in the drivers seat. The single player career mode is a nice idea but annoying you can't skip the races you aren't interested in unless you start higher up the ladder but then you miss out of some of he earlier fun ones.I love driving/racing games but somehow I just can't get into this one, and I can't really explain why.

												THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER... As a player of forza 2 3 and 4 and also Gran Turismo 1 2 3 and 4 I can tell you that this is the WORST out of any racing game I have ever played. Bought this off of ♥♥♥ for $30 and even at that price i feel scammed. PROS- Well... um... There's lots of tracks and cars i guess.CONS- Physics are terrible, clip the curb of an apex and the next thing you know your kissing a wall. The grass spins you out way to much. Driving a stock Renault Clio turns into driving a Formula drift car over ice covered in butter.- Graphics are WAY to beefy. People are saying this game sucks because its optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards, I have a NVIDIA graphics card, and a decent computer, but running this game on all of the lowest settings is a challenge.- The GUI and menus DO NOT ALWAYS SUPPORT CONTROLLERS. I'm using an Xbox controller but in most menus you have to use the keyboard or mouse to use, which is a hastle for me because i like to sit far away when playing racing games.- All of the cars are too clutchy, a little flick of the joystick sends you into a 180, and there's no way to fix the sensitivity.- Tapping the brakes DOESN'T WORK, you either give it the beans our come to a complete stop. If you tap the brakes you get an EASY spinout which will cost you the race.- Penalties. Get bumped off the track in qualifying because of one or all of the control issues in this game? Good news! Your next 2 lap times dont count! took me 15 minutes to quallify 4th to last. - Go Karts. Are they really necessary? The brakes are so sensitive that even a little bit of braking stops t he kart immediately. Plus they unreallistically rev really slowly after stopping, so every time you use the brakes, you're looking at a good half second off your time.I haven't even gotten to use the multiplayer because this game is si bad in single player. Too bad you can't get your money back. "

												Hmm.  What a mixed bag this is.  As far as physics go: this is not the best simulation.  It's ok, sort of a Forza style representation.  Slip angles are extremely forgiving. Slides are quite eaily recoverable.  Understeer is more prominent than oversteer, though both are fairly minimal.Force feedback with a wheel: lacking.  Even if you spend hours and hours tuning and tweaking the force feedback (which you WILL), you won't get as immersive an experience as rFactor 2, iRacing or Assetto Corsa.  It feels numb, lacking in representative feel relating to what you see on screen, and sterilized.  There's also an extremely heavy centering spring that you'll have to spend lots of time tweaking to get where you want, but it still won't be great. This is my biggest dissapointment with the game.Graphics: These are pleasing, but they aren't as amazing as they're made out to be.  On par or slightly ahead of Assetto Corsa is my best description.  There's tons out there on the graphics in this game.  Tone you hype back a notch or two and that'll get you a relatively good expectation level for the reality of them.Audio: Nothing particularly stands out.  It's sufficient.Gameplay: The career mode is underwhelming. I enjoy that its all about the racing, but I find it lacking depth via no differences between the teams you sign for and an obfuscated progression between series.  IE: There's no real clear goals to achieve in order to attract a team from a particular series you want to progress to.  There's some big and obvious flaws there I'm extremely surprised the developers didn't seem to notice.  The one thing they get right is track and car selection.  It's very diverse and populated.  Easily PCars' best attribute.Other: The UI is annoying.  It's pretty but when it comes to using it, there are many places of frustration.  For example, only being able to change FFB settings in the main menu options.  So you have this thing that takes a ton of initial setup work (yes, even after the updates), and the only way to change the (many many, too many really) settings is through the main menu. Yet, the only way you can test those changes is in game.  So the end result is the user spends hours and hours tweaking in the main menu, booting up a session, quitting the session to get to the main menu, changing things in main menu, booting up a session, etc, etc.  It's one of the dumbest things in the game without a doubt.  Choosing a car skin is similarly annoying as well.Overall, the game is a struggle.  That's the best way to describe it.  It has a, on the surface, career type I want.  However it doesn't excecute it well.  The physics are *ok* but not very good and definitely not up to par wih its competition.  The force feedback is a quagmire of disappointment.  The visuals are nice but not nearly as pretty as advertised or hyped up to be.  And there are a myriad of annoyances throughout the experience from UI design to choosing a car skin.  The one and major saving grace for this game is its extensive car and track list. I won't go over the PCars 2 drama and what that may or may not entail.  Nor will I go over the development drama of this game. However, as an owner of this game, I really hope Slightly Mad Studios keeps working on this title.  It still has potential, but at this point is more of a Beta release than anything.			"

												I have played Grand Tursimo, Project Gotham, Grid Series and various NFS games (With a racing wheel). And my first expirence past the Go Karts. I turn off all driving assisstances in the game including ABS and traction control systems.I spun out alot in some car no faster than my actual car. You cant just drift around corners you'll spin out, it is a very unforgiving game you have to work to learn the corners (which gear, how much throttle, braking, steering angle, driving line). Too much throttle after a corner, spin out. Brake too hard especially in a rear wheel drive, spin out. Raining and you try to floor it off the line, spin out.  Even a poor gear change can cost you 2 positions easily. I literally sweat trying to hold poll position. I love having to work on it. Critizing myself on how i performed each corner.There is a no BS game, you dont have to earn money to unlock a car. All tracks and cars are avialable from the start. You dont spend an hour putting decals on your car, you'll spend 1 hour tuning your car to fit your driving style on a specific track. The gratification in this game comes from mastering a track, not from earn 1mil to unlock a car. Getting hyped you knocked off 1 second from your lap time. It really is a racing game for racing enthuesists. The game is literally about racing nothing else. I get people like and are used to unlocking cars, tracks, decaling their cars and a feeling of progressing through a story. If so this is not the game for you. Its about mastering your favourite cars on the track. P.S - Have not expirenced any bugs/crashes  "

												When I first got the game I was quite excited.  You see, I bought into the hype.  Mistake number one.  Mistake number two was spending money on this.One minute it is Ok, the next it is horrendous.  One car sticks to the road like it's glued on, and the next, a pure race car is like driving on some kind of super slick polymer.  Almost all cars feel utterly disconected from the track.  Random sounds thrown in to simulate what, I don't really know.  Gave it a go and tried playing career, but when you have rain tires on in the rain and the slightest input of any kind and your car is off the track or into the wall or going backwards.  All the while the AI is driving around as if it were on slicks in dry conditions.Had one point where in the dry I actually had the fastest lap time until the last three seconds of practice when BOOM, an AI driver beat me by a mere twenty six seconds putting me at number two.What a joke these guys played on the consumer.  Next go around they will not get my money.  I will give it to Polyphony Digital.  Grand Turismo may be a little numb on occasion, and they may still have AI issues next time around, but at least it is not one big, unfinished, riddled with bugs, lie to the consumer.  The saddest part about games like this is that the people that make them are utterly shameless about putting out trash.			"

												It's true there is no perfect sim, they do all have their good and bad points but wow all the hate talk...really. The force feedback was a bit lame at first and you kind of need to be a race engineer to set it up nicely but when its set up....OMG its phenomenal. Yes there is a mountain of various settings to properly tune the cars but again, when done correctly.....wow! This is a sim, you are meant to have to tweak till the cows come home in order to set good times. I've encounted very few bugs since first installing the game and have had nothing but a damn good time playing this title. Assetto, iRacing, Raceroom, Forza, Gran Turismo, Dirt, I play them all and others, yep, they are all good games but this is something else, and it will only improve as subsequent patches roll out. Maybe I was blessed with a special platinum edition of the game or something but I fail to see where all the negative crap I keep hearing comes from.			"

												This is a great simulator. My first run was with the Mustang Boss 302R at Brands Hatch. It didn't feel right, kind of floaty... then I dug into the MANY MANY options, and found just the right tuning setup for me and the way I drive.  Granted, I still feel like I need some practice, but that's just awesome.  The graphics are good, in some ways better than anything else out there, in other ways the additional realism makes it feel a little flat.  (Sometimes in game development, a little oversaturation in colors makes the game more engaging, making it feel more real somehow compared to photographic perfection.  It's all a perceptual thing.)  On the whole, so far, I'm very, very impressed.  The number of choices and options is just staggering.  The only real flaw is some of the options have nice descriptions in the center pane when you select them, but then there's other areas (like controller settings) that offer no advice or documentation whatsoever.  I hope they'll polish that up a bit.  But again, really great sim.  Another thing I will miss from Grid Autosport is earning cash to buy new cars, and getting sponsors to get more cash... I found that personally very engaging, and that's missing from Project CARS.  However, it's absolutely not a deal breaker, just a personal preference that I'll miss.			"

												Heres how this goes...Been playing racing games since F1 96 on the psx, completed all the greats, toca 1 + 2, Gran Turismo 1,2,3,4...Moved to PC gaming, got into SIMBIN's Race07 heavily in 2012, did well in an online WTCC league, Race07 was always noted for the touring cars being 90%+ accurate to real life.Discovered Raceroom Racing Experience, have got into that in a big way in last couple of months and spent a fair bit of money and time on it, shame its not that well optimized cause the sound is beautiful.For over a year ive been waiting for the moment I had some spare cash laying around to buy Assetto Corsa, and this week I did......... I got my wheel working and tried so desperately to like it, but being used to stripped out ready to race race cars i guess the ROAD CAR physics wernt my scene, I managed to get a refund from STEAM and thought bugger it.... Ile try out Project Cars......Cautiosly however, i downloaded a cracked version first, OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im literally addicted!As soon as my refund went back in my back i was more than happy to lay out £40 for what could possibly be, the greatest piece of software released in a long time.As ive said ive played all the big racers (even had a go on Forza6 the other day, sorry but anyone claiming that to be a sim is clearly deluded... it just isnt)Project Cars however, is a great sim! The sound cant touch R3E (nothing can frankly) and at times i find loosing the back end a little be too forgiving, and like R3E drifting isnt really built into the physics like it is on Assetto...... but i guess thats the real point.Some Sims Simulator road cars, others simulate Race Cars.... no sim does both very well.If you want to race, Project Cars is the real deal (seriously its nearly perfect)If you want to hot lap like the Stig or Jeremy Clarkson in Ferraris then Assetto Corsa may be your thing. Theres a vid on youtube proving how bad assetto is at simming race cars, an old lotus f1 car doing nord in 5:20, then same car in project cars doing it in 6:14 .... nuff said.I love this game, and sense my laptop's GPU will die before i get bored of it.Thats another point....... the eye candy!!!! I have it looking like NGEN GFX on an ASUS N56... and its very smooth, very well optimized!!!<3			"

												Not for everyone. Explaining project cars is not too easy. Lets put it this way. If Need for Speed is a fastfood hamburger, then Forza is Pasta dish at an eatery and Project Cars is Savory seafood dish at a well known restaurant. Like food, you have to have a distinguished taste to like this game. It may seem subtle at first, but this game is insanely DEEP. It's worthy of a simulation. Many people say ""Physics this, and physics that"".. but I wouldn't pay too much attention to that talk. Seriously? How many of you have actually driven a GT3 down Silverstone going 80mph around a tight corner? You don't know that kind of physics unless you do that for a living. The physics have been designed in this game in a way where it takes some learning, but the good thing about this is it's VERY rewarding learning how to properly drive fast. I honestly wouldn't buy this game without a wheel. Gamepad is horribly difficult. The wheel, despite force feeedback issues, feels very natural and easy to learn. In conclusion, it's a fantastic game if you give it some patience. Highly recommended for car buffs			"

												Project Cars is an arcade racing game. It is not a simulation as some would want to make you believe. The AI is unaffected by rain, too many races suddenly change from sun to rain to the point where it is not realistic. It is good as an introduction into racing, but I have discovered there are actually better alternatives (rF, rF2, GSCE, AMS, R3). The game is still full of bugs, the main one for me being the fact that the order at the end of race is incorrect. It calculates lapped cars wrong, resulting in the last unlapped car being put at the end of the finish grid, while actually it should be in front of all lapped cars. It's astonishing that this never got fixed!!! The ai have better lap times in practice than in qualification, wtf? Some cars feel like skating on ice. Ok, I have never driven a real race car before, but it seems highly unlike to be so slippery in real life (especially after heating up the tires). One of the few ways to try to counter this was to deflate the tires enough, to try to improve the grip to a more reasonable setting (which does have the side effect of heating up your tires too quick). It's better to invest your money in Automobilista or their upcoming successor (at this moment referred to as Reiza 2017). You will have a better racing experience and far better ai, plus the added bonus that they listen to the community and try hard to kick out bugs & improve their sims.			"

												What's to say about Project Cars? I honestly can't put my finger on it. It claims to be a sim but it sure doesn't feel like that to me. Driving physics feel ""wrong"" after playing Assetto Corsa for well over 200 hours with a G25 and TH8R shifter. The cars I've driven so far feel clunky, even when the settings are set to realism. There is no sense of speed when you go over the track at 250 km/h and still feel as if you're going 100 km/h.   The list of cars is also a bit disappointing. There is, however, a huge list of tracks, featuring some of my favorite like Spa, Nordschleife and BRNO. Project Cars isn't a bad game but the physics and the way the cars handle still make it feel rather arcade than a sim. Do I recommend this game? I'd say no, not if you want a full bred race simulator.			"

												Ok where to start with Project CARS...Graphics 10 out 10. Game is effin pretty; beyond any other racer currently out. The Weather and lighting is some of the best I've seen in any game to date.I'm using two very old 550ti 1 gig cards and Project CARS seems to perform fairly well on those. I'm able to run at 1080p with all settings maxed except for MSAA, AA and or FXAA. I run FXAA at low and sometimes I opt to run at 1600x900 with FXAA cranked all the way up. The thing is even at 1600x900 Project CARS is still a very pretty game. For those with higher performance rigs take it up a notch and add SweetFX to the mix.Simulation vs Simcade vs Arcade: Project CARS on the surface can hit that area of simcade a lot of players look for, but, dig a little deeper and Project CARS is a full on simulation that can be brutally difficult with no room for errors. There is nothing Arcade about Project CARS.Views: There is a wide range of views to choose, from cockpit, helmet to third person. You can adjust the depth of fields on the fly to fine tune to your liking. Track Selection: All the best tracks in the world, been years since I've played a game with this good of a selection on day 1.Controls: If you're using a controller, you won't have much of an issue with just getting straight into the game. However, there is a lot to be desired still. I find the default setups to be very twitchy on an xbox 360 gamepad. I've had to put numerous hours into adjusting my controls which leads me to the next part.UI/GUI: Project CARS has the worst GUI I have ever came across in my life long gaming career. It is confusing, lackluster, ugly and hard to use. So for example in the controller setup there are no tooltips that explain a single thing....This is kind of ""what the ♥♥♥♥"". So you're forced to look for guides on steam or other websites that explain how the controller setups work and what everything means...Then you can't adjust controller setting from in game. So you are forced into this cumbersome process of bouncing back and forth between this terrible GUI. The entire UI sucks and sucks hard. There is nothing good to say about this UI. It's horrible. Car selection is even a chore, the tunning menus are somehow worse than the controller settings menus. This UI is pathetic, what a waste. This UI looks like something a 10th grader worked on at night after he/she got done with their homework for about 2 weeks. Then brought it to school for show and tell. COME ON GUYS. GET WITH IT. This UI brings Project CARS down in so many ways. SMS has made a great game here, held back by a ♥♥♥♥ING HORRIBLE UI.There is no section of Project CARS that has a good UI. It's all bad. In career mode, the ui sucks, online the ui sucks, tunning the ui sucks, controller setup the ui sucks, car selection, track selection the ui sucks and just to type it out one more time....THE UI ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS.So Project CARS is pretty, fun, and, held back by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥, god awful, train wreck, amatuer UIProject CARS still has numerous bugs as well. You can't even enable advanced options in controller setup, because if you do, you have to remember to go in turn on the settings you want each time. For the life of me I can't figure out how to save a controller profile so I can load different setups. It seems it's simply not an option. Again ♥♥♥♥ THIS UI. FIX IT SMS!			"

												Good luck surviving the green light chaos. Oh and also good luck overtaking the AI on tight spot. :)[TL:DR]Update After Patch 2.5:I've changed the review to not recommended. I do really know this game has an astounding graphics, vast choice of cars. But what makes me change my mind is the support from the developer, the community, and the bugs that's still not fixed up till now. The pCars Head Developer is not even trying his best to help the people that has issue with the game (see the top review for the proof about his attitude towards his customer). Well, no comment about his attitude anyway, as long as he's still working on it.The issues I'm dealing right now is that when I start the game, the SMS's logo pops up and it stays the same for a long time. When I try to click, the game crashes, and Steam says that I'm still in the game. So I have to restart my PC again. I have reported the issue but that Ian Bell doesn't want to help me. Instead he makes fun of me, tho' I have delivered it with the most polite way I have done. Take a look at thishttp://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?32776-Project-CARS-All-Platforms-Patch-2-0-Release-notes-OUT-NOW-on-PC-PS4-and-XB1&p=1025173#post1025173Conclusion: Not even worth a penny if you want the best service from a developer.

The game offers multiple options for gameplay, from Formula 1 style motorsport to go-karting, and offers aassistance for beginners such as me (which can be turned off). The physics and graphics are reasonably realistic, however the AI is not on par. The game is much better when played in VR. A controller or a wheel setup is highly recommended.			"

												As far as racing sims on PC, I'd say this is one of, if not, the best one out there. It has stunning graphics (yet heavily demanding on hardware), realistic races and simulation/damage, and career mode has me hooked trying to level up. Not to mention the vast number of cars and tuning.In regards to tuning, a true petrolhead would feel right at home. You can change everything about the car such as technical details about the tire pressure for each wheel. Personally, I don't have a clue what I am doing with these settings so leave them at stock, but someone with a knowledge of that stuff would definitely benefit from tuning their car to the track conditions.I am yet to try out the multiplayer as it seems like there isnt really progress to be made there, yet I hear it can be fun in terms of messing around with friends.Pros:-Stunning graphics-Realistic feel and steering-Highly accurate track replicas-Intelligent AI-Progressive career modeCons:-Higher graphics settings can be extremely taxing on hardware-Controlling the car is very difficult until you get the hang of it-Fairly expensive when not in the sale "

												This review does not reflect actual playtime or system. I started with the steam version, and quickly realized my laptop was not powerful enough to handle the awesomeness that is Project Cars. Even with settings low, for some reason i had difficulty getting it to run. Steam was very cool and gave me a refund for this version.Last month i got a PS4 with Project Cars, and it now runs as it should. The game is amazing, you really have to compensate in the corners and each car feels very unique. I really enjoy the addition of the highway tracks and both of them are very scenic. Project Cars is for the driving enthuseiest and i would not recommend this for a beginner, although you can play with assists i don't recommend it. I consider myself a moderate driver but i still need a ton of work when it comes to sim racers, it has a nice variable difficulty which you can play around with to suit your tastes. Many cars are quite challenging to drive and get the hang of. Karts are lots of fun. I have played everything from Gran Turismo to a little iRacing.. keyword a little. Project Cars is pretty unique and its worth a try if you love racing.			"

												As a newcomer to the simracing world, I've seen a lot of negativity around project cars; both with lack of cars, and general wheel behavior (force feedback, steering, etc). I am using a Logitech Driving Force GT (DFGT) wheel, and after scouring forums, I found a few setups and configurations that most people thought were good. Well, these were older forums. Like 2015 forums. Anyways, I tried out their settings, and honestly, they weren't good. I reset everything to default, my wheel profiler, and the game controls, and wheel settings. Controls are great now. This game is an absolute blast, and the career is excellent. While it may lack a bit in substance (no story line, etc), there are emails that you receive, and contracts, etc. I've heard Assetto Corsa is better, but I'm in no rush to compare the two.

Forget the marketing on physics in PCars, you'll still hit invisible walls and obstacles on the track that will stop your car dead.You can race your friends in this, yes the matchmaking is easy with steamworks integration, but forget about being competitive.  Why? Because the lap times don't show up properly at the end of each race.

												Bought this game thinking it would be great for the Vive, I had played Elite Dangerous a lot and know how fun an immersive cockpit style game can be in VR, So naturally i just assumed it would be really fun to get the same experiance from a racing/car style game. All of the positive reviews had me going.So lets get just dive into the point real quickly,  I will look passed the fact that the game its self is very bland, Most Simulation games can be, And the fact that the AI is pretty well dumb?But if you are buying this for VR be prepared to get some pretty intense lag from time to time. My Specs are.EVGA GTX 980 Classified Edition6700k i7 processor 4.0ghz32gb Corsair Dominator Platinum Ram512gb SSDLiquid CoolingEVGA SuperNOVA 1600 PSUYou get the idea, I have a pretty heafty pc that should be more than capable of running this game let alone VR, Yet i still get Vive frame rate loss on a lot of the maps unless i go into 3rd person mode which sorta defeats the purpose of the vive. I am not the only person having this issue i have talked to a few people claiming they had the same problem.Until they get the frame lag issue sorted out for VR i would not buy this unless you are just playing it on a regular monitor.

												First   Would you recommend?    In a frickin heartbeat.   I am an AMD USER and Yes I recommend. AMD A-6 6300 Black edtion, and AMD R9 270X. 16Gb ram. running a solid 35-52 fps in most conditions. Yes I am running High and Med settings. It looks apsolutly amazing.     Now this is a issue with the Amd patch. Somebody blew it! OK lets not throw the baby out with the dirty bath water. This game is nothing short of amazing. This game is not better or worst than AC. It's in a league of it's own. IMOP this is way more fun. It's way more emersive, with more driving then one human can do in a life time. And the racing is fun and fair. every car looks, feels, drives, and sounds differnt. And you must learn the car, track, the wather. But you learn on the games time not your own. They'll fix it and somehow it will even be better. Can you play now? oh He** yes. that's where I'm going now.			"

												Solid driving experience, nice graphics, great sound what else do you need? Well  a couple things  would be nice, like custom online championships, bug fixes, even more customization of races (there is tons) and we are missing some great tracks and  cars.

												I mean... This game has everything. Yet I don't like it. I bought this, Corsa, and Dirt Rally at the same time. I've tried my best to get into Project Cars and on paper I should love it but I hate the way the game feels. It has A LOT, but masters nothing. Lots of cars, lots of graphic effects, lots of settings, lots of tracks but none of it feels right. Maybe it's good with VR?I love Corsa, Dirt Rally, Forza 3, even F1 2016 (so far). They are all very specific games, but this game tries to do it all and it never feels rememberable or intense.			"

												Oversteer in a FWD car.. Nope, try again Slightly Mad Studios. Track and Car Selection are fantastic, but driving model doesn't make sense. The game is hard, not because its difficult, but because the car handling is completely wrong, Assetto, Iracing, hell even Grand Theft Auto's racing is better than this.

												Not worth waiting 3-4 years for. The biggest let down in this game is actually audio. Granted, very few racing sims get this right, with the notable exception of Simbin - the sound experience in this game is downright unpleasant. Its supposed to make you want to turn UP the volume, not down - as is currently the case. I suppose the game will look nice on an NVIDIA card - but I will never know. My HD7970 struggled to keep this at 60fps - but only after spending an hour tuning settings; At which point it looked no nicer than a stanard Xbox 360 game. Dont believe the hype. PS: Oh, and the menu UI is laughable.			"

												The game was fun when i first purchased it some months back.  I recently started playing again and a patch or something must have been released because my xbox controller no longer works. If the controller is picked up by the game weird things happen during a race like the gears shifting one direction constantly making the game unplayable.Maybe other people might be luckier then I and get the controller work. otherwise be warned that unless you like racing with a keyboard or have a steering wheel setup, you wont be able to play the game.

												Alt-F4 is disabled. On a game like this, the ability to quickly close it when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI drives you to want to smash the monitor is essential, and in this case nonexistant. I don't get why games disable alt-F4. I know that if I alt-F4 the game won't have a chance to save, but I don't care / I don't want it to, hence I'm trying to alt-F4 out.On to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI then. Weather doesn't apply to them. Cold tyres don't apply to them. Blue flags don't apply to them. Cut track penalties don't apply to them. Your position on the god damn track doesn't apply to them and they attempt to drive straight through you EVERY TIME. Sure, you can get around this by setting the difficulty to 0 and lapping the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, but I want a challenge! I don't want to just tap them lightly and watch them drive off the track to give way - that's not a battle for 1st place! Neither do I want to have them completely ignore me and wind up taking us both out as I go for a pass and they decide to suicide themselves into me. No driver would do that!Unlike others, I haven't encountered any blatant bugs yet. In fact gameplay wise the I think driving is very good. They have the game down, they just need to stop releasing quick cash grabbing car DLC packs and fix the damn AI.			"

												I have played this game for many hours and I really want to say that it's a game that i would recommend to my friends, but, with the way they treat people in the forums and how no real improvements or promises have been fulfilled, I cannot with a clear conscience. I have lower end equipment, true, but it is above minimum specs required for the game and I have less than 60 FPS with all settings to low. And if it rains....forget it. Some tracks are better than others and if the frameraate was consistent even being less than 60 i would be happy. It simply is not very optimized for most if not any computer. So with all the beautiful graphics and they really are, if you cant play it at a consistent FPS it is not worth the money. And as I have said before the way the studio head belittles his customers and the banning of any one who dare point out a legitimate bug is banned and ostracized i would not recommend supporting this studio in this game or any other that has the SMS and WMD logo.EDIT: I have recently majorly upgraded my equipment, 16GB DDR4 2133MhZ RAM: Zotac GTX970 Graphics Card; icore 5 6500 3.2Ghz 3.6 Turbo Processor; Its a beast now, and I still wouldnt recommend this title becuse of the poor treatment of customers and players who are still upset from the empty promises that have not been fulfilled and the poor A.I. and many other problems that still plague this title. I will admit, it is beautiful and really could be a must have tiutle, but , its not at this juncture and dont think it will ever be. I think they have pretty much given up on any more ""fixing"" of the game and the fanboys will say they still have a large team dedicated to this title. But the truth is they have a team dedicated to cranking out DLC not fixing the game.			"

												After quite a few hours in game I have to recommend not to buy this game.There are numerous glaring errors in game that even after two weeks after release have not been patched.Straight up bugs: 2 out of 3 times Setups are not saved (e.g. changing the gear ratios before the race will sometimes not be reflected in game) Many of the default setups are plain broken (e.g. in career mode the BMW M1 Procar has the same gear ratios for 2nd and 3rd gear on some tracks) Game sometimes crashes/hangs during pit stops AI will crash during pit stops blocking everything making other drivers unable to use the pits On some tracks some of the curbs are not existent but only textures. Driving on them will not make a difference to normal road (e.g. Donnington, Spa and others) No collision detection during pit stops, leading to other cars driving through you when rejoining or entering the pitsSome of the HUD Elements bug out (e.g. the ""predictive"" timer)Missing things I consider important for a game marketed as ""the next-generation of racing simulation"":Handling is rather simplistic. Weight transfers are barely present, the car feels lifeless (although I have to say that there are quality differences between cars...still none of them feels good. All assists off btw.) ForceFeedback is not up to par with other sims like Game Stock Car Extreme etc. Even after spending almost two afternoons tweaking there is just no really good feeling. Not possible to share setups with friends Could not find a way to have multiple setups per track (only 1 for each training, qualifying, race) Things that are just not good: The AI is atrocious. Divebombing like crazy, ramming like the best of them...sometimes it feels like racing on a public multiplayer serverThe AI only seems to be aware of the player after being about half way alongside while overtaking. Driving alongside an AI car overlapping only about a third car length is a sure way to be rammed of the track.On some tracks the AI seems not to be subject to the same physics calculations as the player. Clearly visible when following behind closely and watching turning behavior of the AI. Also when driving in rain or watching AI racing through sand/gravel without being affected. Also AI seems unaffected by cold tires... Some of the tracks are just not very well modeled. Some of the corners of Spa are just wrong...the Nordschleife (a track I know from RL) is of laughable quality (Hatzenbach, Miss-Hit-Miss, Mutkurve just to name a few corners are really not well modeled)...in Barcelona the corner radii are off... Pit stops are plain broken....tried to finish a 2 hour race multiple times to only be unable to pit because multiple AIs are stuck perpendicular to the pit straight accelerating into the divider.The replay system is so limited it borders broken. Watching a second replay while driving will bug the replay controls out.This game could be really good. I could overlook the very limited tire model and physics or the lackluster FFB, but all the bugs added to that make this a huge disappointment. And I have given it more than enough time to show its qualities.			"

												So I've not played that much (14h as you can see).I've focused on the ""career"" mode. It's not a real career mode, more like ""drive those races and you can change the mode after you finished the season"" and by mode I mean you can change between GT4 and Formula C and stuff.You kind of work your way up but you can also start in Formula A (the highest one) if you want.So I like it for the fact that you get different race weekends with the whole practice and qualifying stuff which is based on the real regularitions (i guess).But there are plenty of races you are ""forced"" to drive wether you want to or not. So I'm in GT4 atm. and am forced to drive a Lotus cup. If you drive those compared to the GT4 it's like you put on a Speedhack and turned off the traction. If you accelerate to much you will turn around. You cannot even start straight if you've got full acceleration.Thats kind of annoying.All those Karts and Formula cars I've tested seem so freaking unrealistic. I've been karting in real life and in this game it's just like a speedhack version of that. You cannot control anything. Well I can't.Eitherway in career mode I've started with the Renault Clio (since Karts were not an option for me).Those feel like your steering a battleship. You're so slow and heavy.After that I've been driving some GT5 car i forgot. That was better but felt pretty heavy, too.The Aston Martin Vantage (GT4) is really fun to drive though. Atleast I like it. But it doesn't seem to be realistic in any way. You're like driving on rails compared to the Formula Cars. And that's what makes me wonder. Isn't it the other way round?All in all I might not be the best informed racer on earth and I've not tested all the cars in this game but I can say it is partly fun but there are better games focusing on one part of what this game tries to combine.

												I used to play Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix and F1 Challenge 99-02 games years ago and really enjoyed them but lately I haven't had a racing game to play and I've been missing them. So I tried all the modern racing sims and as soon as I tried Project cars I was absolutely hooked. From the lovely realistic graphics to the nose to nose racing, and the real feel of the driving I felt it blew everything else away. And after almost 130 hours I am still loving it. Unlike many other modern games you dont get unrealistic unlocks of technology in this game or daft challenges. No this game is all about real racing. So you get a real career where you can pick the style of racing - GT, open wheel, road, endurance etc - and you progress through multiple seasons gradually getting offers to race for higher quality races. You also get invitations to race events like historic car races and single type competitions that span a few weeks. This game has it all - loads of interesting cars, loads of famous and unusual tracks, pitting, tuning, yellow/blue flags, practice sessions, qualifying, long endurance races over several hours, extremely customisable car AI, weather, race weekends, multiplayer, solo practice sessions, and breakdowns. It speaks volumes that one of my favourite events is the Clio Cup in this game where you race Renault Clios around all-British tracks such as Donnington, Snetterton and Oulton, when you can get so much enjoyment out of racing a little underpowered car I think that reflects the quality driving experience. But all the cars in this game are amazing and you get to learn all of them throughout the career. In terms of downsides to the game there are very few - the car AI is varied and you will find yourself beating Clios at 90% AI around Oulton only to then struggle to beat historic Escorts at 60% around the same track. Also the AI cars dont experience breakdowns or cold tyres. You do get damaged when you collide etc but not as much as you should. Finally there is no Nascar or rally driving. But that is about it in terms of 'the bad'.So overall I heartily recommend this racing game, its far better than anything else for the PC (or otherwise). The free updates and continual expansions really add great things to the game so it keeps developing. And the best thing about this game - you can drive around a track with realistic GT cars, then go watch the same sort of race on Motors TV and its just like it is in the game! It's a fantastic experience that never gets old.			"

												I genuinely like everything about this awesome racing game.  Initially I didn't like the menu system/GUI, but it really doesn't take long to get used to it.  Sounds, graphics and physics are amazing and I've played every racing game from the hyper-realistic SimBin games to the more accessible NFS and TDU series.  This game is closer to the realistic end, but still very customizable to suit any playing level.  I believe they could do a bit more with the Career mode as it's not quite at the same level as say the Dirt series, but overall it's very well done and should keep you interested in progressing through the game.  I love the replay capability (as most racers have), as the game is so pretty I always look forward to finishing a race just so I can go back and watch the replay and maybe grab a screenshot.  Definitely worth the price of entry for any racing fan!			"

												The value of the game and the price tag are like Sun and Moon. The engine sounds all sound the same for respective engine sizes, and cars are *nearly* uncustomizable save for preset appearances. The menus and structure of the game are very shoddy, every time I load the game I have to re-set my control presets, as it is nearly impossible to play without some form of controller. It seems to me that they put way too much effort into making it look graphically realistic, and they accomplished that, but other areas of the game are simply not up to par at all. I still play it just to rip around California highway 1, and there is a decent selection of cars, but alot of them are underwhelming, and beg the question ""Why is this car even in the game?"". I would not recommend this game to anyone as there are other games that do the same job better at lower prices, but it is a little bit fun at least.			"

On multiple occasions I waited for a random game but there never were enough people in the lobby to get the race started.-Campaign more isn't very deep.  Very little sense of progression. "

After playing a lot of games driving with traction control, abs and stability control this game will make you want to turn all them features off and try to drive like a proper racer and experience the true control of a car.Graphics are fantastically stunning and runs max on my GTX 980 but when you race with 20+ car in the rain you will suffer a huge fps drop so dropping the AA down to one of its lower setting (still looks fabulous and no noticeable difference) and you can race with healthy frame rates.

												A worthy addition to any racing sim enthusiast's collection. pCARS looks every bit as good as any other game out there. Career modes in racing sims are usually nothing special, and the career in pCARS is similarly basic, but still provides a fun enough way to learn the different classes of racing and the many tracks that the game has to offer.It's important to note that this is more sim than arcade, so if you are looking for a casual racing title, this game might present a steep learning curve. However, if you have experience with other titles such as iRacing, AC, or rFactor 2, you will be right at home with pCARS.			"

												Project Cars is great. I did have to upgrade from my old GTX 760 to a GTX 970 in order to play this on mostly high and ultra settings, but for the visuals this game provides it was well worth it. Feedback while driving is good, the amount of detail put into each and every car, track, and the environment is fantastic. Also owning Asseto Corsa, I would recommend this game over AC any day of the week. In Project Cars, the menu system is much better laid out, it loads faster, and is far more polished. My only complaint is that I wish it had more cars - but I'm sure they will add some in the future. I'm getting a Logitech G27 this weekend and will likely report back with an update on how well it works with that as I've just been using a controller thus far. So far, I am much more pleased with this over Asseto Corsa (which is okay in its own right, as well).To those of you comparing this to iRacing, I think you're trying to compare apples to oranges. I've always known and been told that iRacing is more of a legit racing simulator, and know several semi-pro drivers that actually used that game to learn some skills on. I honestly wouldn't put Project Cars or Asseto Corsa into that same category at all - they are likie Forza; a racing 'simulator' for those who really enjoy driving games. Games. I just believe this is one of the most well done racing sim games for the PC available to date.So far, I haven't noticed any of the bugs that other users have mentioned, but I haven't tried playing online yet. Gameplay has been smooth and predictable without major issues.			"

												Best racing game available. Cannot say more. Some bugs in the beginning got a hotfix. Now everything works fine (up to 96%). Day-night changes are impressive. Still, some lags make it uncomfortable to drive. Matchmaking is not that easy because you gotta search for a game that fits your preferences. Steering/handling is a bit different from what you know from other games (Grid, F1...) but after a short time you get used to it.To beat iRacing, it needs oval races, but overall for me this is THE BEST RACING GAME at this time.

												I slammed Grid Autosport for being a poorly executed racing game, with bad menus, no cockpit view etc. Project cars takes all that... and does it right.I have been freaking loving this game. The graphics are fantastic, the racing is realistic and generally it's REALLY fun.I've spent the bulk of my time in online mode. Since I'm actually going to Spa soon, I've been racing round it online. Sometimes people rubberband at the start of the race and it does wreck people, but apart from that, the game is good, it was compatible with my racing wheel out of the box, and the online racing was thoroughly enthralling. With practise I'm doing consistently perfect laps, and posting rediculously good times. Other things: The cars take realistic damage which is good, and it is possible to blow an engine or gearbox by jumping to first at 150MPH.It's a damn good fun game, a little addicting actually, and I really recommend playing online!

 Positives + Oh so pretty.+ Excellent out-of-the-box wheel Force FeedBack.+ Decent selection of content (cars/tracks). Negatives - Online server browser is horrible - can't sort columns, limited filters (e.g. can't filter for a specific track).- Lacks car/track mods, but does allow shared memory for 3rd party plugins for profiling. Touch points It somehow annoy's me that I have more fun playing Project CARS than I do with Assetto Corsa. :) Both games/sims certainly have their own draw-cards. I prefer the openness of Assetto Corsa (and can't wait for official Steam Workshop integration), but am really drawn to the different content selection (especially tracks) available in Project CARS. As a whole, pCARS feels far more refined, whereas Assetto Corsa feels ""unfinished"".From a technicality standpoint, my wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) setup and experience is FAR better on Project CARS (out of the box) compared to Assetto Corsa. With a bit of tweaking, the experience in Assetto Corsa can become good, but doesn't seem to feel as responsive as Project CARS.Content perspective, arguably I can download mods for Assetto Corsa - but without workshop integration, the fragmentation makes it too much of a mission for me to care, there are quality issues with most of the mods, and the modding process also seems to make Assetto Corsa really unstable. pCARS doesn't seem to offer modding capabilities, aside from shared memory to allow profiling apps. I'm really loving http://www.tomshane.cz/profiler/ ! Hopefully any upcoming DLC from Project CARS is fairly priced.Final verdict, I give big thumbs up to both Assetto Corsa and pCARS, and would continue to see them as worth getting / having for a more rounded racing experience (plus RaceRoom and DiRT Rally!).

												this game is the poster child for pirating games before you buy them or why steam should offer refunds for games. This game is junk. mainly because It's not really a game. It is more of a simulator. I was looking for something to replace asphalt 8 and this looked like a good game, but after I actually got to play it was hyper realistic crap. the cars seem to have a 2 mile turn radius.

												I was very excited to get my hands on this and when a sale hit, i got it. I didn't really know what to expect...and i was let down.The game feels unfinished. The sound is far from perfect and buggy, the physics are odd, especially for collisions. Visuals are pretty nice, that's a plus.Setting up a controller is a chore, if it works at all. No profiles for that, if you happen to touch something have fun doing everything again. Settings are buggy in general.There is a nice list of cars and tracks availabe, that's also pretty cool, but the sheer mass of content does not increase its quality.I'm sorry, but i would not recommend this game. If you're looking for a proper racing sim get Assetto Corsa or iRacing or rFactor2 or whatever, but not this.If you like to play around in a more arcade style game, go ahead, at a discounted price it sure can be worth it. I'm not going to talk about my feelings when i look at the list of DLC...			"

												There are some good things on that game.It's very beautiful, the simulation is great, the driving view are nice too.Cars are very realistics, even in the driver's first person view.The solo player mod is welcome, with a little scenario it's even better.You can modify a lot of things on your car. Same for the in game options.However, i'm a lil'bit sad about some missing content.I'm talking about a real collision motor. I prefer Grid for that.Some mythic cars too are not in the game (Veyron, GTR, Agera..) - or maybe it's a DLC but if it's true that sucks -.And I would like to see more street racing..Whatever, if you like simulation racing, take it.

												After playing the game for a few hours, single and multiplayer offline/online I have come to the conclusion that this game is awesome!.The big pluses for me are the following:   1. The sound 5.1 is amazing.   2. The menu. At first I wasn't sure but now I love it. Very easy to navigate.   3. The options in the Gameplay, graphics, HUD, career I could go on an on. They make you game experience a breeze.10/10 for me. Great game.ADDIT:Have now played it for 20 hours+ and I am still loving it. The only thing that bugs me is occasionally it crashes and also sometimes in single player I have to restart the race as I have now control over the cars.Apart fro that I still give this game a big thumbs up. keep up the good work.Also the online racing community is really nice. Players seem to play sensibly.			"

												hellofirst of all before i say this, id like to say ive played this since its release, and almost every day ive played it on a number of tracks, both online and offline, so please dont lecture me, but this in why anyone thinking of buying this game, should turn around and run away...i can understand that on release a game is not going to be perfect, lord knows rome 2 wasnt, and i can same the same for most games, however there is a line that has to be drawn, and the issues with Pcars..is that it should not have been released in the first place. Let me explain - the cars and tracks are fine, thats not the issue, they feel fine, the speeds are realistic, even the weather and detail..is amazing, but...the one thing its needs to do most...its fails at miserably - driver input ....how many times do i have to enter a race, and have the car accelerate without my input, how many times do i have to be mid corner...and have the wheel go full lock to the right? how many times do i line up on the grid, and get a drive through penalty?? why do i enter the pits to change to wets, and come back out still with dry tyres on??!!! ... why was this game released...with those bugs in existence, those are game breaking bugs. the enthusiasts that trust the developers and look forward to ""real"" feedback, have been betrayed and stamped on, and still after updates, the issue, the most important thing that makes racing fun, has not been fixed....ive just raced at le man for 2 hours...only for the car to snap randomly..due to the steering going.now i know what your going to stay - ""your steering is wrong, its your fault not the games"" but...i am not the only one ive spoken to that has this issues. and my wheel is perfectly fine in iRacing..GTR2..and others, so that..is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.And just to give you the full truth...PCars 2 has been announced...and most the features, like driver swaps, safety cars, dynamic systems, have all been taken out of Pcars and put into Pcars 2!! so not only have i bought a game, where i dont get what i invested in, but the biggest part that annoys me...is that the developers..dont, give a dam ive never read news, or seen anything that has had a positive impact on the way PCars feels, and the way it drives...and for a person that is a creator of a racing league, someone who love motorsport and racing ...i feel let down and dissapointed that people could turn their backs on the very people that made their company flourish....I wont be playing until they fix this game, but its not like they will care, as they already have my money to invest in their next broken mess to be released in 10 years or so. Ill stick with iRacing, a company that actually offers you a service, and delivers whats on the tin...OverTheLine			"

												If you are going to buy this game please understand that this is not Need for Speed Underground and that in order to play it properly you need to invest some time in understanding cars and tracks.  Don't be suprised when your tyres or engine blows up after a long race if you haven't invested any time trying to setup the car for a particular race/track.Do ignore people who are complaining that the developers announced Project Cars 2.  The only difference between these guys and other game companies is that these guys are honest and they let their clients know whats coming so that can get involved again.  It most certainly doesn't mean that they forgot about this game.  There is another DLC coming out tomorrow.It greatly annoys me to see these ignorant, moronic reviews which only indicate intellect of people buying the game not the actual game.Ignore the children complaining about a hard game.

I gave it a 9, because known of this game for about 5-8 years hype builds up so much in those years. It is better than I could expect. The twinkies (horizontal bumps) at lemans that launch you into the air don't. People have been saying that there is no force feedback while using a wheel... not true, I have a G27 wheel and racing a F1 around nur you feel more than you could imagine from looking at the track. This is a sim, casual weekend racers beware! This game is really everything we wanted from forza and GT, Rain, Night racing, lights, physics, absolute carnage! True Aerodynamics, Tyre wear and fuel on or off are seperate! Endurance racing, parts will fail and break like they actually do IRL! This game is really out standing! It looks amazing I don't have it turned up to ultra yet because I only have a GTX 650Ti :(. All in all this game is what we asked and begged for for years and years never to get it.

												Being a previous console racer (Gran Turismo and Forza) fan, this game really has filled that gap for me.  The physics are awesome, the graphics are awesome. The game still requires mouse/keyboard in some spots for the menu however it has decent controller support in the menus (compared to assetto corsa). Many of the negative reviews are not against the game, but the politics behind it (crowd sourcing for PCars 2) and game bugs while developing a new game.  Many of those people complaining don't understand software lifecycle development, and I am happy to hear they are continuing development. At the end of the day I had a only a few crashes on release 1.4, so hopefully the latest and greatest 2.0 release resolves those issues, but I wouldn't call the game unplayable.			"

But some where down the line it didn't happen. After 5 years of working on this racing game its still not done. Menu's still lock down , Kart tracks are open for racing only no pratice can not put a set on have to run the one it came with. When you cut track they turn you  power off for 5 sec right in front of other cars . Why not a drive threw . SMS wanted to make it so we could swap drivers (not working). Set up menu is a mess can only save one set up per car per track. Can not send set ups to friends . There are all kinds of bugs in the game there is a bad force feed back issue with g-27 if you exit on the track and then go back out the wheel will pull to the right. If you want to run more then one class of cars there is no way to pick what class of cars run . When you open it up to all cars on the start of race you have all type of claasses of cars all over the grid. Maybe a filter sytem to allow us to pick what class runs. Beside not finishing the game. Why not sure but I wish it would get done because it could be best racing game out there.			"

												Released in 2015 but it's still not finished?This is the most beautiful racing simulator I have played, but so long after release it still has flaws that can't be ignored. Every time I run Project Cars, it resets my desktop wallpaper to the Windows default. How did this become a thing, and why is it still a thing, especially when the bug was first mentioned in a thread from May 2015?I started playing the career. On the second race of the first event, my kart crashes into a wall during the rolling start, before the player is allowed to control it. It then sits there wedged into the wall until the other cars cross the start line, putting you about twenty seconds behind. For my first experience of the game, this is pretty abysmal, again made worse by the fact it has been out for two years.Based on its current state I can't recommend this game.			"

												I got Project CARS on release and it was a huge disappointment. Bugs everywhere, terrible performance on AMD cards, cars  glitching all over the road, etc. It was almost unplayable at the time, and with the announcement of Project Cars 2, I assumed it was going to be left to rot. I'm glad I was wrong. Many of the bugs have been fixed, and in that time I switched from AMD to Nvidia and can run the game much more smoothly. While some bugs persist, such as infinite loading screens, players randomly being flipped around on the starting grid or the invisible wall bug, the game runs much better and is a huge improvement on what it was like at release. I mostly play online in the GT3 class, and there are full lobbies most of the time with plenty of other people to race against. As with any public racing lobby, there's your mix of inexperienced slow players, angry ramming players, lagging players glitching all over the road and AFK players that never move from the grid. But this isn't the game's fault, and it's still possible to have very satisfying wheel-to-wheel battles against other sim racing fans. TL;DR - tentatively recommended as long as you're not using an AMD card and don't mind dealing with idiots online.			"

												This  racing game  was going to be like no other racing game. I know was in on it at the start. Beta test this game for 3 years. They SMS had great ideas not sure what happen. But some where down the line it didn't happen. After 5 years of working on this racing game its still not done. Menu's still lock down , Kart tracks are open for racing only no pratice can not put a set on have to run the one it came with. When you cut track they turn you  power off for 5 sec right in front of other cars . Why not a drive threw . SMS wanted to make it so we could swap drivers (not working). Set up menu is a mess can only save one set up per car per track. Can not send set ups to friends . There are all kinds of bugs in the game there is a bad force feed back issue with g-27 if you exit on the track and then go back out the wheel will pull to the right. If you want to run more then one class of cars there is no way to pick what class of cars run . When you open it up to all cars on the start of race you have all type of claasses of cars all over the grid. Maybe a filter sytem to allow us to pick what class runs. Beside not finishing the game. Why not sure but I wish it would get done because it could be best racing game out there.			"

												I got Project CARS on release and it was a huge disappointment. Bugs everywhere, terrible performance on AMD cards, cars  glitching all over the road, etc. It was almost unplayable at the time, and with the announcement of Project Cars 2, I assumed it was going to be left to rot. I'm glad I was wrong. Many of the bugs have been fixed, and in that time I switched from AMD to Nvidia and can run the game much more smoothly. While some bugs persist, such as infinite loading screens, players randomly being flipped around on the starting grid or the invisible wall bug, the game runs much better and is a huge improvement on what it was like at release. I mostly play online in the GT3 class, and there are full lobbies most of the time with plenty of other people to race against. As with any public racing lobby, there's your mix of inexperienced slow players, angry ramming players, lagging players glitching all over the road and AFK players that never move from the grid. But this isn't the game's fault, and it's still possible to have very satisfying wheel-to-wheel battles against other sim racing fans. TL;DR - tentatively recommended as long as you're not using an AMD card and don't mind dealing with idiots online.			"

												It is second to none when it comes to racing graphics.  The AI can be quite competitive and is mostly great aside from when you're following two AI cars and dive on the inside or outside about to make a move and one will cut over to block (which is great) except that they always slow down drastically as well.  For me this has happened frequently.Also, when racing the go-karts there is no sense of immersion.My biggest complaint is that you are only allowed one car setup per track.  Even racing sims from over a decade ago can handle this.  I'd recommend Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2; however the graphics in rFactor 2 are no better than the original rFactor.			"

I was about to win, when one AI cut me off at a corner by slamming into my side. I swerved out of control and hit another car, causing a 5-car pileup.I went from first to last in 2 seconds because the AI is so ♥♥♥♥ing dumb.Still a fun game though. 10/10 would Niki Lauda again.

												Has some flaws, and the car selection could be much better, but an absolute blast to play.  Whoever thought Kart racing could be so much fun?  Career is entertaining and there is as much or as little challenge depending on what you want.  I got this on one of the Steam sales but am having so much fun got some of the DLC to increase the experience.  Imagine it's amazing with a wheel but I'm having a ton of fun with just a humble controller.  If it comes on sale again DO NOT HESITATE!!!!!			"

												Down a 40 of whatever you want and play this game. Soon the one inch of wheel you let go onto the grass and the subsequent  'YOU CUT THE TRACK HURRRR DURRRRRRRRRRRRRR"" just meeeelts away into the background as you settle into the sweet embrace of alcohol poisoning.After the hangover (and funeral), you realize the achievements are absolutely ridiculous. Driving 50 km/h for half an hour or doing a 24 hour race in real time? Sounds like a great ti-oh wait.Also, Go Karts are the equivalent of running around with the care package glitch and a tac knife in Modern Warfare 2. Or the pistol in Halo 1. Just a liiiiiiiiitle cheesy. Unless everyone's doing it, in which case you're all cheese. Like the AI at 100 difficulty in the rain. But this is why I love this game. It's just a bit ridiculous. It makes you just a bit crazy. You begin to WANT to drive your LMP around the track over and over to get that .1 of a second. This game with a wheel? great. This game with a wheel AND a VR headset? perfect.			"

												If you like racing games this HAS to be in your collection. One of the best racing sims on PC. The handling of the cars has a great feel with each one having there own characteristics. Your able to feel tyre wear as it slowly drops away and if you leave the pits on cold tyres and expect to go flat out, you'll quickly find yourself in the barrier. The weather not only looks great but adds alot to the racing as the track evolves from dry to wet.The career mode is great for those who enjoy single player racing as you progress up the ranks into the higher formulas while also getting the chance to gain invites to special race series throughout the race calender.For the graphics, the videos and pictures say it all. Sounds are great also.This game is a must have!			"

Looking forward for the second chapter that should improve the multiplayer experience.			"

Its really just grinding races, to move on to something more fun.I think its a decent game, but i probably wouldn't recommend it.

												Being a sim-racer, I've heard discordant voices about this Project CARS. Many depicted it like the definite sim, many others as a simcade junk. I got it on the Steam Sale and chose it over Assetto Corsa only because it was 5€ cheaper.The game is actually very good! The visuals are astounding and really scream for a VR headset, the handling of the cars feels solidly realistic, there's a good selection of cars and the career mode, although still not addictive as a Gran Turismo or a Forza Motorsport, still compels to play the game more. The AI is aggressive (sometimes even too much... they don't know when to back down thus they are always fighting) but it feels quite natural and overtaking one always gives a great chill of satisfaction down the spine.The car setup has an overwhelming amount of choices, and not being an engineer myself I always have to rely on the setups over at projectcarssetups.eu. this is quite frustrating and a bit boring tbh.Online is good, lots of options, dedicated servers, competitive tools, and it feels like there's a good community out there on the public servers (but I really need to explore it more). Sometimes there are some lag spikes, really annoying and potentially race-breaking, but they're maybe a problem on my side, even if CSGO and the rest play smoothly.PRO- it can be a tough sim, it can be a simcade- astounding visuals- helmet view with loss of focus is immersive- lots of good and funny cars to drive- lots of great tracks (but not enough from the F1 season unfortunately even tho the big names are there)- four different modern F1 cars, plus some blast from the past like the 70's and 80's Lotus- I'm looking forward to race in an onine F1 championship- Career is fun, but confusing - which is championship, which is invitational?- It's easier to drive than iRacing - which leads me to think that iRacing is actually at fault here.CON- the interface of the setup seriously needs an overhaul- there are some weird issues with the deadzones- you can't run it on ultra. EVER.- Career could be better- there are some leftovers from some unimplemented features, like the engineer suggestions for the setupDefinitely reccomended for all the sim-racers out there. Vote: 9/10STEAM CONTROLLER: it takes a bit to get the feeling right, because the game is not straightforward on its settings and even by setting the deadzone to 0 you'll still need to use a bit of anti-deadzone to make it feel right. Otherwise it works perfectly, you can also use an actionset for driving, an actionset for the menu and set them in the configurator to switch automatically based on the cursor shown.It's definitely the closest to a wheel you can get - without a wheel. Turn on the vibration for feedback and use a touch menu for additional options!			"

												The game was very good for if you want to just race on race tracks and not have an open world to drive in, but it needs more cars that you can use on the road.And there is no open world so you can run from the cops or anything. So the price is way too high since you race on certain maps and such without being able to have a open world.The only great thing about this game is if you want to drive on race tracks realisticly(rain, dark, or shiny) then this is the game, but its only realistic if you have these special steering wheels and special brake and/or gas pedals.

Pros Sleek menus and interface. Stunning visuals. Extremely in depth customisation and tuning of cars, graphics and difficulty. Huge range of car classes and diverse representation of real life motoring franchises including Renault Clio Cup, GT4, GT3, LMP1, LMP2, LMP3, F1, Karts etc. (As of patch 6.0) Good optimisation: 60fps+ on near-ultra with an R9 390, 60fps on high with an R9 280x Controller and Wheel SupportNeutral Points Realistic variables such as tyre temperature, fuel, tyre wear, damage and lighting that affect the difficulty of the game - some may not like this simulation style. Buggy (although I have never encountered a single bug in the whole time I've played.) Career progression system - not able to access all branches of motorsport from one class (for example, you can't go from GT3 to F1.)NegativesOption menu not available during the race, not even the audio options. Very difficult to find a multiplayer game that isn't mid-race and isn't a super long one. Aggressive AI that, can make mistakes but will then decide to drive straight into you upon returning to the track, making you spin off.In my opinion this is the best simulator (or sim-cade if that's how you want to describe it) you can get. While Assetto Corsa and iRacing have the better handling and input feedback, neither have the graphics, career depth and interface to match PCars.			"

												Unless you set the game up for an arcade-like experience, you probably won't find instant gratification in Project CARS. It takes patience and practice to stay on the track and be competitive. Once you do get the hang of it, there's a lot of enjoyment to be had.My favorite aspect of Project CARS is being able to set up custom races. You have complete freedom to choose the track, cars, weather, time of day, number of opponents, difficulty, starting position, race rules, warm-up/practice/qualifying rounds, and much more. This alone offers unlimited replayability.I notice a lot of the ""helpful"" negative reviews are out of date.

												Hats off to all the devs @ Slightly Mad Studios for putting together one helluva well presented dream racing sim! All hands are down when it comes to any other racing title out there to date. Project Cars has to be the most competitive and ultimate driving experience enhanced with jaw dropping graphics and ultra crisp life like enviroments. The physics of each cars handling and performance goes way beyond all expectations flawlessly. The total score of my vote is limitless.			"

												can not be recommended for VR! The performance in VR is so poor, its beyond playable. I have decent hw(I7-6600, GF 1070) and the fact that on the same hw assetto corsa with compareable settings runs smooth, altough it has no official htv vive support (which pcars has) is a shame. I recommend assetto corsa with revive instead!			"

												Best SIM driver at this moment, but they need to expand their functionality in online racing if they want E-sports involved in this. Driving with a controller is possible, but Google for some settings otherwise you can get dissapointed. Sound is real, graphics a really fantastic, weather conditions etc. If you love racing a SIM, then this is your game for at least 2015 and maybe many more years.			"

												Well, it looks like the long wait was worth it!A very nice looking and nice playing game. Career mode is decent, online is a bit hit and miss, with wildly different standards of driving, reminds me of driveclub on ps4, it's easy to get barged off on corners!It's much better to join a dedicated community like Racedepartment to play online.The physics and handling of the cars seems really good, though not up to Assetto Corsa standards, then again what is?It's also very good that you can easily set up a server for you and your mates, to practice, tune, race, etc.Overall a solid 9 out of 10, it's everything I hoped it would be!!

												Overall I rate this game 'Very Good' I think the visuals are excellent, especially the changing weather and time of day, all fully customisable you can set your own weather patterns such as fog, to haze to sunshine starting at dawn :)The Game does have some issues, hopefully they will correct them in 1.4 patch.  AI are a bit frustrating, they will always turn in when you try to pass them in the braking area, always!  And if they can't make the corner they will not yield, they will cut the corner to retain position without any recourse.Force Feedback is a bit vague, you can't feel the slip in the rear of the car so you can get easily caught out by random spins.Otherwise I do really like this game, I'm enjoying the career mode and the freedom of setup for single race events.  Online is very easy to ge into, the lobby system works very well and I like how you can force all to use the same car.  Of course you get the usual rammers online, but this happens in all games so as always best played in private lobbies with friends.I hope this helps some people :) "

												Welp, i gotta say... multiplayer is pretty broken for me since this last patch. Not too many problems in single player, but the multiplayer bugs i've come across so far are:-Game will sometimes crash to desktop in the middle of a race-Will visually and audibly stutter-Has tons of server side lag (in a race between more than 3 people you're almost guarnteed somebody is driving sideways around the track at some point)-Will lock you into a camera view even though others can switch -Not being able to drive when you've joined the game so you need to quit and rejoin-Cars will sometimes spawn on top of each other at the start of a race These are most of the bugs i've seen so far, i'm sure i could add more if i thought hard enough. Now, some of these bugs can be funny at times, but combined you're sure to experience very few completed races, or at least races where an external bug factor doesn't somehow screw the race up. I get the whole ""Games will have bugs"" dealio, that's a given. But as it is, i paid a premium for a game that has delivered half of what it should have been... so far. I'm hopeful that they will fix these problems in the near future, considering they've sold over 10 million copies worldwide (I'd say thats a bit of capital influx). Also, I'm pretty irked about the fact that they've come out with DLC already for a game that desperately needs fixing. All I can say is that with all release delays (which i'm fine with in order to catch bugs and polish the game), it seems like one of 2 things happened:1) Multiplayer was SO broken that it actually did take that time in order to get the game to its current state OR2) They pretty much ignored blatant game bugs, which i have a hard time believing.If Slightly Mad Studios can't take the criticism, they shouldn't be making games... or they should just sell out to EA which shares that philosophy. There will always be trolls, but these are legitimate complaints. Good luck SMS.I'm recommending this game simply because the single player hasn't given me very many problems and it really is a good racing sim.  It just desperately needs some mulitplayer side fixing.			"

												This game is a race car driving simulater. NOT a racing game.I was excited about this game. I love forza, dirt, and grid. I thought it was going to a combination of the best of all 3. It was, but it also wasn't. The graphics are good. The amount of detail on the cars rival, if not surpass, forza. However the track and the environment suffer. The AI in the game is okay. They follow their race line and thats that. The will not move. They will not try to take the outside to pass you they will try to go through you in order to pass.The game play is great. Each car handles in its own way. You feel the difference between the BMW M1, the Zonda, and the go karts you start out with. It is wonderful and I give full credit to the developers who made it. It is a job well done.My biggest problem is the shear lack of cars. No ferraris. No lambos. No Bugatti. No koenigsegg. No Volkswagon Golf. No Chevy Corvettes. Litterrally 3/4 of the cars you find in Forza alone are not in this game. They have very few normal cars for you and your friends to drunkely race. Few super/hyper cars that you can only dream of owning and want to top out. It is by far the biggest dissappointment. The cars that are availabe are race cars with few road cars availbe.This game is supposed to make you feel like you are a young race car driver. It does and it does it well. I now realize this after I played the game for a bit. I also realize what I liked about forza and grid and dirt are not good for a game that wants to be as real world as possible when it come to making you feel like a acutal race car driver. Grid, Forza, and Dirt are racing games. They look good, they feel good, they are focused on making the driving experience entertaining and fun. This game focuses on accurarcy above all else.

												Well im dissapointed , it feels unfinished , short of content and im reluctant to stump up for extra content , handling is rubbish as soon as your car looses traction you cannot ride it out you will crash stuck in to the barrier and have to reverse out , crash detection is woefull , slightest clip and your in a lurid spin , some tracks have blind dips and as soon as you hit that your car goes light and you most likely again crash .AI is weak the lead car just sits behind you and the rest fade away , yep or you crashed and worked your way to second there is a big gap to first  . the slow cars are decent to drive with more mechanical feel but supercars on fall apart at the first corner with the crash detection and the knife edge handling .i am using a 360 xbox controller , its working better in win 10 but pre update in win 7 i had no hope at all , no support for 360 controler unless it has been patched now i dont know .out of 10 i rate this unfinished game 4 .but if it were finished it has promise .

												Oh man, I paid $30 and I glad I did! This game's the bee's knees!-After some tweaking, the X360 controller is pretty easy to use. (Turn turning sensitivity down to 20 as a start).-On my GTX 780 based rig, the game can run 90fps (144hz monitor) with DX2M (double resolution and MSAA) + FXAA high and high(reflections, shadows, env mapping)/ultra settings. Grass and motion blur are low since I don't really need them.-Cockpits are pretty. After tweaking the helmet cam, TrackIR support is super awesome.-Did I mention this game has go-karts? Like really pretty ones?-All of the tracks and cars are unlocked from the get-go.-A bazillion tweakable options for racing nerds. Maybe if/when I get a racing stick I'll think about it.One minor nuisance, the menu music is a bit too epic for me. Di.FM fixes that. :)I wish this game had splitscreen, but Trackmania and Grid Autosport take care of that I suppose.			"

												9/10+  Very technical, the game enforces good racing habbits by severly punishing bad ones.  I'm actually learning things just to be competitive on easy mode, this makes it really addictive.+  Graphics and sound, especially the weather system.+  Flexible game modes allowing you to play pretty much any way you want.+  Runs very well on my i7 4770k, 8gb RAM and GTX 560ti.-  Selecting a cars and tracks is a little odd.-  The AI has a tendancy to ram you out of its way.*  If you get the ""Lap time is invalid"" message because you went off the track, you can still finish the race, it just doesn't compare your lap to time any records.  Cutting the track or intentionally ramming other cars will get you in trouble however.*  If you play with a controller, you'll need a keyboard to do things like exit the game.  The game itself plays beautifully however, be prepaired to use some finesse!*  If you're looking for an arcade experience, move on.*  The game focuses on modern, high end vehicles, so it might not interest you if you want to experience driving a Shelby Cobra or racing your Toyota Camry for example.

												I don't get it, I've driven quite some fast cars very fast and they never felt so prone to loose control like in this game. I always start feeling disconnected with a game, when I e.g. choose a BMW M3 and the game has it performing like some average street car, except it isn't able to do 20° corners at 50 mph without troubles. So if i can't trust the sim with cars I've driven myself how should I trust it with the others... Maybe getting a 300€ steering wheel would be better than using a controller, but at this point I'm just to afraid my experience wouldn't be different if I would buy one.. Also great is the ""going into a corner at 20, hitting the grass with one tire, better spin completly"" experience			"

												tl;dr I really like this game!I have been a gamer for a very long time and have played many driving games, but mostly at the arcade end of the spectrum, Burnout Paradise (arcade driving perfected) and NFS etc.Occasionally I would dabble in closer to sim games like Forza, F1, Grid, Gran Tourismo and enjoy them, but they have their limitations of sitting in the uneasy space between arcade and sims, not quite fun enough to be arcade, no accurate to get a satisfying drive.I have tried a few proper sims, but I always find them too hardcore and hard to get into, basically I don't find them fun enough to persevere with. I made the mistake of buying Assetto Corsa which while it simulates car driving well, has no discernable game around it, the AI is terrible.So, I have been following Project Cars for a while and unfortunately missed out on supporting it in early access, I bought it on day of release.After playing it for a few hours I can say this is the more serious driving game I have been waiting for for years. It isn't a full on sim, with all the baggage that carries, but I would put it at the casual end of the racing sim genre.I play with a steering wheel (old logitech Momo) which after setting up in game works well, although the Force Feedback leave a lot to be desired, it is very weedy and inconsistent. The general driving experience is great, whether doing time attacks around a course chasing ghost cars of faster real players laps, or when driving in races against the AI. The AI is the one of the highlights of the game as they genneraly act like real drivers on the track, and not crash into you like other games do. You can adjust the AI strength from 1-100 which allows you to fine tune the experience so you get a good race. I haven't tried MP yet.My only major disappointment is the Kart Racing which unfortunately you have to do a load of races in to progress through the career mode. The Karts hand terribly with a wheel, I found I had to use my 360 controller instead, which fortunately makes the Karts playable, though still very tricky to drive. The AI in Karts doesn't work too well either. Personally I don't think they should have included Karts in the game, it detracts from the masterpiece that driving the cars in game is.There is a wide array of tracks in the game and a decent selection of cars, although 95% of the cars are in the very fast to warp speed classes, and only a handful are at the slower end where I like doing a lot of my racing.I know the hardcore sim snobs look down their noses at Project Cars, but IMO they should be more supportive of it even if they don't play it themselves. It acts as a great introduction to the more serious side of racing and will probably lead to more people moving to sims down the line, which is good news for their niche ecosystem.Overall I can really recommend this game to someone who want a more serious driving game that isn't intimidating.ProsGreat gameplayTop of class AIGreat graphics, makes you feel like you are really racing in a car.ConsKart Racing with a steering wheelForce FeedbackNot enough slower cars for my tastes			"

												This is the first PC racing game I've played that's been able to fill the gap left by Forza Motorsport, now that it's an XBone exclusive (because there's no way I'm buying one of those).Controls are tight, to the point where I'm considering picking up a racing wheel for this game alone because a controller is not doing it justice. More configuration than you can poke a stick at, I honestly don't know what half of it does.Graphics are incredible but you'll need a high end rig to do a packed race without framerate drops on ultra settings. If you have less than a dozen cars it's usually fine. I get a solid 60fps driving in heavy rain with 12 cars on the track on the highest possible settings with a GTX 980.Plenty of beautiful tracks to race on, including Bathurst for any Aussies out there.Personally I'm a little bit let down by the variety of cars, but there's definitely plenty to choose from. You'll be going without brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini... and even more of a let down for me was the lack of V8 Supercars (something that is offered in many other Steam racing titles such as Grid Autosport). You can't have Mount Panorama with no Holden or Ford V8 to drive! EDIT: DLC adds some extra variety, such as the Old Vs New car pack adding some Fords. Very cheap too, the base price without discount is only $4. You'd be paying on average around $1 per extra car WITHOUT a discount.Definitely worth picking up for $50 or less. I bought it on day one and have enjoyed it since (usually play in offline mode connected to a TV so my hours don't reflect how much time I've spent ingame)			"

												Good game.  Don't view this as a Forza or GT PC alternative. It's something different.  Which, IMO is a good thing.  Yes, it has a few bugs at the moment, but nothing too bad.  I felt the FFB was a little light at first (I use a thrustmaster TX, on a dedicated rig and triple screens) but I became accustomed to it and now feel it's spot on, even using default wheel settings.  I recommend taking the zero to hero career route to get the most out of the game. Once you get the hang of the karts they are excellent, plus you get to lean the basics of racing and there are some great tracks. The AI I find to very good, gives some great close racing.  Not played online yet so I can't comment on that. All in all, a very good game.			"

												Excellent racing/motorsport simulator buried within a not-quite-finished game.  It is fantastic when it is good, but there are many small issues that need either work-arounds, or outright avoidance.Pros: - Great track selection - Great selection of track day & race cars - Outstanding graphics - Tons of options - Rift support!Cons: - UI is cumbersome and frustrating - Ongoing bugs - Flags/pitstops not well implementedOverall, I recommend the game based on its technical achievement and excellence when all of the features come together.

												I've been toying with car sims for quite a few years now, and honestly, this one is the most realistic and precise car sim I've ever used. I've raced on GTR, GTR2, GTR Evolution, GT Legends, all of which are *excellent* sims, but this one has just a little thing more regarding the feeling when you get behind the wheel. And graphically, of course, when watching replays, I find myself thinking this is footage from Eurosport channel, and then realising, oh no, this is PCars! :-) :-)I've read some negative comments about this sim, but honestly, it does not feel any worse than all the others I've tried, and I've raked up a fair amount of time on them, on the contrary, I think the force feedback is very precise and you can really feel and anticipate loss of adherence and feel the vibrators on the tracks, the difference of track textures and the bumps. This is of course quite subjective, as everyone is different, but if you love driving and cars, and have a decent wheel like a Logitech G27 or better, like fanatec, this won't disappoint you, I guarantee you that.Have a nice time on the track!

Pick your car, set it up right, race.  Since patch2.0 the AI has gotten more tame without becoming boring, a good challenge now.  Online Multiplayer is working good for me, I participate in 2 ""sprint leagues"" (waiting for additional pitting bug fixes before the Endurance Leagues get going).

												I really tried to like this game and put many hours into it but I just can't stand playing it anymore.There are so many problems with this game. AI divebombing you when they pit. AI driving on grass as if it was fully rubbered in asphalt, AI constantly smashing into the back of you when you brake. Screwed up tire model where I can drive with wet tires for a whole race on a dry track without them melting (tire wear was enabled in options). AI not yielding when you go to lap them, resulting in more crashes.This game should have been in development much longer. PBugs is an appropriate title.			"

												I've been playing racing sims since I started in 1993 with IndyCar Racing, and I've played most of the ones that have been released since then. Some off the top of my head would include IndyCar Racing I & II, F1GP2, Grand Prix Legends, Sports Car GT, Richard Burns Rally, GTR/GTR 2, GT Legends, Race/GT-R Evolution/Race On/etc., RaceRoom Racing Experience, SimRaceWay, Game Stockcar (including Extreme and Reiza's truck game), Live For Speed, netKar Pro, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, rFactor 1 & 2 and NASCAR Racing 2003.I can wholeheartedly say that among all of the sims I've ever played none have felt as alive, as deep in handling nuances and as engaging to drive as Project CARS, and it is by far my favorite sim of all time (it also inspired me to really look into the physics of racing and to develop my own spring and damper calculation tool, which I'll release at some point). I'll tend to agree with Ben Collins and Kristian Roos in that past sims were often way too difficult on and over the edge, too punishing. Like Rene Rast has commented, racing cars are designed to go and be driven fast and inspire confidence in the driver, they're specifically designed to be good at going fast, which means that until you start to get to the limits, they're not that necessarily that hard to drive. So the cars feel like they actually do have some semblance of grip as they should, but start pushing to the limits and shaving those last hundredths of a second and you'll find all the challenge you could hope for.I love this game.

Feels more like GTA than a racing sim.Graphics are odd. Game is not built with triple screen in mind, unlike Asseto Corsa.Vehicle and track selection is the only good thing I can say about the game.Probably can somehow be fixed with setting change but the menus are horrific, Takes too much time to understand what each setting mean. Spent more time in the settings section than in racing and still no good outcome.Can't believe I've waited for this and spent more than 5$ on this.Good bye and welcome back, Asseto Corsa.			"

												PROS+ Quite pretty for the most part, apart from a couple of issues mentioned later.+ Fairly good selection of first-person cameras.+ Menus are crisp and well laid-out.+ The logo is quite nice (seriously, I'm struggling quite badly for positives here).CONS- AI incapable of racing, but will barge you off the track at any and every opportunity, and never seems to actually lose control even when it should.- Laughs in the face of actual realistic physics.- AI seems to be completely unaffected by rain, not needing to change tyres, remaining fully in control and continuing to post the same lap times as it would in the dry.- Car will veer off the track or spin out for no apparent reason.- Constant (scripted?) engine blowouts - I've even had a few occur on the first corner of the first lap!- Basically zero customisation options: you can't even choose your helmet, and the game will blatantly ignore your choice of number.- Noticeable screen-tearing, even with V-sync on and a 4GB GTX770.- Bland and lifeless crowds at race venues.- Career mode is marketed as sandbox but is in fact linear and lifeless, and doesn't even really let you know what's going on.- Limited selection of vehicles.- Limited and very poor selection of venues.- Go-Karts are awful. Just awful.- No real sense of immersion or of progression.- Extremely poor and limited selection of 3rd person cameras.Basically, DON'T BUY THIS UTTER CRAP! Spend your money on something else. Anything else. This is the worst racing game I've played in a long time...			"

												PLEASE NOTE: I own a Nvidea GPU so I have no comments on the AMD performance issues.PCARS is a semi-sim racer, being more realistic that GT and Forza but less realistic than Assetto Corsa/iRacing etc.  If you are looking for a modern sim racing game I recommend buying Assetto Corsa as its FFB and physics are in a league of its own.At first sight you will notice that PCARS isn't as 'pretty' as advertised, that being said it is easily still the best looking racer out there!  You will also notice that the Force Feedback is a bit dull and doesn't give you that true feel that you might expect from your wheel, in my case being the G27.  However after doing some research I found a helpful link in the Steam community forums that completely changed the feel of the game: http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?22938-Jack-Spade-FFB-Tweaker-Files&p=891198#post891198 The physics in project cars is decent not following the mainstream arcade route.  I might be wrong but I think this is the first ""sim"" racer that targeted the mainstream market, thus also attracting gamers without wheels.  This caused some confusion since sim racers are nearly impossible to drive on keyboards.  I recommend that you save up some moola and invest in a wheel.  After some practise you will learn to love the more realistic feel and never look at any arcade racer ever again.A summary:If you are new to sim racing(like me) and do own a wheel I will recommend this game for you.  This game is easier than true sim racers but also requires some  practise to get use to and it's very rewarding once you do get the hang of it. Thanks for reading :)			"

												It's absolutely the most amazing racing game ever! Why? Well it's very realistic because of the damage models, the fact that you can blow your engine if you damage it too much or if you don't know how to shift gears, the game shows pretty much all the states of your car, way too many for me to understand, the driving physics are pretty realistic as well, atleast compared to other games. There's many cars and tracks you can choose. Plus they'll be adding new cars every month! The graphics as well are pretty amazing, just kinda make you want play the game just to look at it. This is a pretty good buy, but if you do decide to buy this game you should invest into a racing wheel or a game pad if that's more of your liking.			"

												Note: This review has been changed since my purchase of a decent racing wheel for my PC.This game is for hardcore racing sim fans only. Why do I say that? You need a steering wheel for this. Sure, you CAN use an X-box controller, but be prepared to spend a long time setting it up, and it still won't be great.I have a Logitech G920 with clutch and pedals. It cost me a pretty penny but I feel it was worth it as it really improves the game (and every driving game I have). BUT it doesn't improve this game enough, unfortunately.You see, Project Cars is a bit of a cluster-♥♥♥♥. If you want career mode, you will be at the mercy of a calendar, which will often force you into a very narrow band of choice with regards to racing types at any given time. This means that you will have to slog through a lot of racing types that might not be for you in order to get to the races you do want, and even then you might have to slog through even more crap to get to those. It's tedious, especially when the AI will plough into you, causing disqualifications while perfectly hugging the race line without drifting or anything.During a racing session, whether it's a solo race, free practice or career mode, you will be unable to select a colour for your car... sorry, that's not true: you can select a colour, but you won't get it in the race (a problem that has been present since release) These things really detract from the game for me as I don't get a sense of progression, achievement or ownership. I want a nice, unique paint job on my cars. I want to unlock cars and be able to use whichever one I want (confined to the racing type of course) rather than just be told to eat what's put infront of me.This is a sim, through and through. The driving itself does feel nice, but only with a wheel. It's a real shame that more effort wasn't put into this game to give it some staying power or making it a bit more user friendly, as the gameplay is a real let down. If you are happy doing races in whatever cars are thrown at you or failing that, playing single races with no sense of progression, then you might enjoy this game; but you had better buy a wheel first.

												Love this game.  Physics are outstanding, the different tiers are great.  Most realistic weather effects bar none.  I hope the car selection is expanded along with the track selection.  I've never seen car models so detailed either.  EDIT:  Seems AMD issues were fixed so I edited that out.  I use nvidia so it didn't affect me to begin with.  No matter.  Buy this game!			"

												I really didn't care for Project CARS when it first went public, but they added Vive virtual reality support and I fired it back up again to see how it was. Magnificent! I love it now. The menus are well done and easy to navigate and it is just simply beautiful in VR - with one glaring exception...Slightly Mad - Please, PLEASE allow us the option to render our whole car in the cockpit view. In VR it is just so disturbing to look back and see the rear of your own car not fully rendered especially in the open wheelers.But the rendering issue doesn't keep me from recommending it especially for anyone driving in VR. It's just so nice to go blasting around tracks or along Highway 1 like you are really there. So damn cool!Highly recommended! And folks, VR is how this sim should be experienced!			"

												It's absolutely the most amazing racing game ever! Why? Well it's very realistic because of the damage models, the fact that you can blow your engine if you damage it too much or if you don't know how to shift gears, the game shows pretty much all the states of your car, way too many for me to understand, the driving physics are pretty realistic as well, atleast compared to other games. There's many cars and tracks you can choose. Plus they'll be adding new cars every month! The graphics as well are pretty amazing, just kinda make you want play the game just to look at it. This is a pretty good buy, but if you do decide to buy this game you should invest into a racing wheel or a game pad if that's more of your liking.			"

												The best racing game I have ever played, with the irritating caveat for new users that its default G27 ffb effects are terrible and the ffb system takes a lot of headache inducing tweaking to rectify.[comparisons influenced by comparing to Grid Autosport]+ UI is nicely designed and very well integrated with online elements which allows a much more social experience for example competing with community ghost cars and quick access to online play, colours are bright and graphical elements are well thought out and modern in the form of a tablet icon layout.+ With some Ultra settings on Tracks and Cars (i7 4770 nv 760 ) graphical detail is excellent much better than GA, nice clean well modelled cars, track surfaces and general layout are excellent, almost photo realistic even on a small monitor- Despite high anisotropy I find there is some ""jaggys"" at distance that can make judging distance to oncoming corners sometimes difficult+ Car interiors are excellent really add to immersion, find myself playing in these all the time despite other views such as bumper view being arguably clearer, much better immersion factor compared to GA- Lack of split screen mode hurts long term playability if you have 2 wheels and friends, a great shame for a game with so many other features+ Pit stops requesting fuel and repairs in online races, plus presence of practice and qualifying rounds online before races really adds to immersion makes for a fantastic race experience+ Level of detail in customising cars, such as camber and toe settings, downforce, tire temperatures for inner,med,outer and so on and on are almost endless, the defaults for each car are pretty good though I found the default gear ratios sometimes off for some cars and tracks, the potential depth of gameplay to be had by endless tuning is excellent, though daunting the defaults are okay! Menus presented in a decent fashion as well.+ Online community is good, good online integration+ Physics model compared to GA is much better, physical modelling of tires and contact forces, cars handle very well really adds depth, tire scrubbing if turning in too fast, loss of traction, cars suspension bottoming out, tire temperatures and effects, fuel weight effects, many nuances are shown for each car, cars look great in replays and adds a level of detail in car handling not present in many games, really cool!+ Audio [edited after 2.0] Car engine sounds are great and diverse, environmental sounds are too loud, typically hearing crowd sounds over tire sounds is very problematic. After 2.0 tire sounds are much better to hear but still difficult to pick out over the din of the crowd, still wishing tire sounds and states were better transmitted through audio as it helps to get a feel for the car. Loss of traction sounds, brake lockup sounds and other sounds are more noticeable now post 2.0 which is a lot better than before.+ Offline is extensive regards career mode, nice offline practice and quick race functionality+ Car selection is amazing, DLC are cheap, all have great interiors and outstanding 3d models and textures, repaints available for each car are amazing and look amazing.+ On a 4770 + nv 760, with some Ultra settings but no [ott] particle effects I am getting 100fps + offline, dipping to well above 60 in online with many cars, I would say it is well optimized even more of a shame they never fit in split screen as it seems reasonable spec computers can get good framerates.+ Good menus for fiddling with controls, defaults for many peripherals***************************EDITED After 2.0 (removed rant and recondensed with more positive outlook after recent changes);Prior to 2.0 and as a new user coming from GA to Project Cars with the G-27 I had a lot of trouble getting the force feedback to a reasonable state which made left me very sour.As a more experienced player now finally getting a better ffb experience through my own tweaking and understanding the numerous parameters I have removed the rant with my new outlook, however as a new player even into 2.0 there are many frustrations with ffb and feel of the game through this popular wheel which I will add a condensed rant;- Default FFB settings as of 2.0 produced endless amounts of ""clipping"" on G-27 resulting in terrible feel through wheel feel and can really offput you getting into the game further.- Default Car setup page FFB effects are in my opinion terrible for new users, many of the default tire forces, for example lateral tire forces, obliterate subtle helpful force variations for example tire torque, and have to be radically tweaked to get better feel, I recommend only Mz and Sop Lateral forces on each car at 100, zero out all the other parameters or your wheel will get saturated.- FFB options are many falling into two primary filtering techniques, relative mode and soft clipping mode, by default the relative mode is used though I found this unsuitable with jumping between cars with wildly different tire forces (ex. FA to Road Car) resulting in clipping. Basically the over 20 sliders dealing with FFB are a headache for new users and require a lot of tinkering and exploring to make them feel better.[I think FFB feel is a subjective thing, if its of any help I used the soft clipping settings of; SCH2,SCF0,RelSettings All 0, Deadzone 0 Deadzone Falloff 0.05, TF 100, Knee settings of position 70 and strength 30. Though these are ok for me as of patch 2.0 subsequent patches may alter tire forces and render these useless!] [These are also in conjuction with default car ffb strength and only 100 Mz and 100 Sop Scale + 100 Sop Lateral, too many other car ffb forces here I find washes out much detail] [I even ended up charting my own G27 force linearity, or so called linearity, it has a very linear response at ~70% force upwards at a logitech profiler strength of 106 (I found this the most linear response strength) Below this its all over the place with higher force output than input, I used a knee reduction of strength of 30% at the 70% mark to match aprox my own wheel and it feels ok, different profiler strengths produce much different outputs, the default 100 produces some odd dips and rises as well. Not to mention the force deadzone, though this can be treated with increasing the force strength, more strength less deadzone, 106 is not as much deadzone reduction as higher but has best linearity]- Learning about ffb effects and interactions as a new user is as you can believe a bit of a bore lol! Once you are past the hump the game is good and the ffb is good too, though the game at default makes too high a demand of a new user with a G27 (and other wheels?) to get good force feedback across different cars without asking for a ******* degree in tweaking :(Rant over but better than before!**********************************************TLDR Version;+Game is the best racing game I have ever played, It is the best racing game in existence.- Users with a G27 will need to be patient to get the game ffb working, keep at it, hoping much better default ffb setups will come in future along with much better car default ffb effects as well.*********************			"

												I tried this game coming from Assetto Corsa, I saw it on sale and pounced. I found this game very hand-holdy, and unnecessarily complicated like HAVING to click the small ""sign"" button for contracts. On top of that the controls feel really squishy. I get 83fps but it is the most unstable 83fps ever.Maybe it's just because I'm coming from Assetto Corsa, but I can't recommend it.			"

												this is one of the best racing sims ive ever played. i own assetto corsa and forza but this game takes the crown in all categories in my opinion. both games lacked some umph and this game delivers. the graphics are stunning. using my wheel the game drives amazing and feels more real than anything ive felt before. the amount of tracks is rediculous and while theres maybe only 50 cars they are very good ones to have in a sim and they all feel unique. the experience is rather exspansive, from actual pit stops to qualifying rounds to tuning you cars setup to the astonishing AI, this game has it all and will leave you with a smile on your face. i will say there are some negatives. first everyones heard of the amd gpu issues which luckily i dont have to worry about, but its ****** for anyone that runs a amd card. next is there isnt many players online very often, enough to play games with but not enough to have a real choice of what you play due to lonely servers. the game also has a boot issue where once it starts it minimizes to desktop and you have to reset nvidia backend software for it to maximize again which can be achieved with gamebooster( razer cortex). these are the ONLY issues with the game that i have and im very picky about the sim racers i play. so if you like sim racers dont you dare miss out on this one. its ******* awesome. just be patient for the few hickups its having at launch. im still a very satisfied customer of wmd and mad studios. my setup is i7 4770k 16gb ram gtx780 and a g27 steering wheel. i run the game at high settings 1080p at a CONSTANT 60fps.  message me if you have questions about the game boot issues.

												Let me first start off by stating the positive attributes of the game, and then I will elaborate as to why you the consumer should not waste your time/money on purchasing this travesty of a ""racing simulator"".  There is only a few qualities of this game that I can say are positive: 1. Graphics/IQ(don't trust the requirements posted on steam, you will need a high end system in order to achieve ultra IQ at 1080p+/60 fps), the graphics are phenomenal.  2. Track selection: the tracks in this game offer a wide variety of locations.   Now for the negative stuff 1. Lack of content, and progression system, the career mode is an absolute joke and lacks vision as well as direction.  This game is more inclined to simply be a venue for test driving F1/Super Cars because that's pretty much all you will get out of it.  2.  Little to no in game sound tracks, while engine noise is nice the ambient background chime of music seen in almost all racing games is a must.  3. Control's, this one takes the cake and should be the primary reason for not buying this game.  If you are using a typical Xbox 360 or similar controller you will be in for quite a shock, as almost every car is virtually uncontrollable  or handles like a boat no matter the difficulty settings.   It would appear the developers could give a ♥♥♥♥ about the majority of players whom aren't using a wheel with this game.  After all is said and done, I have played many racing simulators, and others like them, but this game still cannot stand up to the likes of Gran Turismo, Project Gotham Racing, or Forza.  Dare I say it but DriveClub, actually does a better job than this game, finally if you are interested in the new Need for Speed Shift 3 buy it, otherwise avoid it.Note on System requirements:  I am running an extremely high end system when compared to the system requirements listed on steam, and still drop below 60 FPS when running at 1080p on ultra.

												I have 170 hours logged in the game, but about 50 of them are using the internet trying to figure out how to get the thing running stable, and 100 trying to work out how the force feedback works. It is the worst implementation of force feedback I have ever seen in any game ever. There are so many settings, and no matter what I do, I feel like I'm driving a boat that somehow suffers from snap oversteer.Of the 20 hours I have actually played, the AI drive like pastor maldonado on a sugar high, and the career mode is about as rewarding as watching paint dry, only to decide you dont like the colour.However credit to the art and sound team, the game looks and sounds really good2/10 Quite possibly the worst but prettiest racing sim I've ever played.

												This game has a lot of hype, but it is extremely boring.  It's only worthwhile playing with other people.The amount of vehicles, currently available, is not that good.  Most groups/classes, only have 1-3 vehicles to choose from. (unless you like Formula/open wheel)  They also promise ""Each month, Project CARS players will also receive a free car. We started with a bang in May with the $3.4m hero car from the movie Furious 7 - the Lykan Hypersport - and players can expect delivery of the next very soon...""  Seeing as it's now July, we're still waiting on the 2nd & 3rd free car... (Edit 10-16-15: 4th free car has been added.  We're a few months after release now, & unless you're buying up all the DLC, there aren't many choices for cars.  If you own all of the DLC, the car choices are much better now.)The amount of tracks, currently available, is average.  One would expect a lot more tracks than what they have now.  Most tracks, currently available, are variations of each other.  They boast a whopping 110 courses, when in actual fact, there are only 30 actual tracks, which they call locations, with most having 4+ different layout variations.  http://www.projectcarsgame.com/locations.htmlThe graphics are above average (I have no issues with an AMD setup, FX6350, R9 280X, with 16GB RAM).  Nothing like what you see in the media releases though.The realism is, well, there is none.  This is an arcade racing game allowing tuning of many parts of the vehicle.  Yes, each change will alter what the vehicle does, but, the ""simulation"" side of things is an illusion.  There are too many unrealistic features for some of these cars that, no matter what you alter in settings, it will never feel like you're actually driving it.The career mode is a waste of time, literally a waste of time.  There's no reason to even do the career mode.  No story.  You don't unlock anything.  You don't get special licenses to do special races.  The AI is not that good.  If anything, the career mode is for people without an internet connection (I.E. PS4 players).  I think that's the only reason it's there.The online mode only searches games within your Steam Download Region, which can only be changed manually.  (This has now been fixed.  Well done WMD.)Controls are not controller friendly, no sensitivity options for throttle, brake or steering.  It's either 0% or 100%, nothing in between.  (Steering is now a bit more forgiving with a joystick/controller.  Throttle/brake, are still 0% or 100%.)This game is NOT worth the money they're asking.  Even half price is still too much!  60-70% off and you've got yourself a game that is worth buying & playing.  Perhaps once they start adding more vehicles, needs about 10x more, it MIGHT be worth buying at its current price.This is an Early Access game at best!Edit 7-19-15:I will say that with the past couple updates, they have managed to fix a few bugs & create a better experience when playing.  Although, it was at the expense of new bugs & new penalties that may alter your gaming experience.  Also, still waiting on these new cars that were promised.  And for those that didn't know, WMD have already started working on Project Cars 2.  Granted, release is still years away, BUT, please make this game better first!			"

												The cars are very driveable but not easy but not easy to drive. I like it that if you lose grip, you can catch the car. The career is long and challenging but you can adjust the strength of the AI drivers. I have them set at 70% and that's just right for me. At that setting, I have to fight for position at the top. The graphics, physics, and sound are great. As for the fun factor, it is very fun. I enjoy Assetto Corsa, Raceroom Race Experience, and Game Stockcar Extreme as well. They all have their pros and cons. I think out of all the sims I enjoy, this one is the most accessible and scaleable to suit the driver's abilities.			"

												First of HOLY ♥♥♥♥ this game is beautiful, and as long as you just stand still and watch the pretty cars it is all good. But as soon as you begin your first race you will realize that there is something completly wrong with this game. i play with an xbox controller and sometimes the game ignores my inputs and refuses to make a turn so you have to put your stick back to the center and try to get repeat the input this is not a hardware problem i have tested this bug with 3 different controller one of them being a PS controller and they all encounter the same bug. Also sometimes the game will armwrestle the controls from you and force you to make a turn when you want to go steaight for some time. and then there is time... when i am playing the singel player time will begin to slow as i enter the begining of a turn and this effect has no duration bar or anything it is just like bam 50% time speed and bam back to normal, they could atleast give it a more fluid transition. I thought i would give racing another chance even though it have never really been my favorite genre of gaming. i sincerely hope they will fix some of these bug, so the game becomes playable at some point			"

												This game is, without a doubt, the biggest dissappointment there has been in the driving simulator genre over the past decade. And that's saying a lot, considering Gran Turismo 5 was released in that timespan. The game lacks basic interface functionality; you can't change the horrible futuristic speedometer you get in racing cars, and you can't even have a rear view mirror in certain camera positions. The menus are irritating and unnecessarily fiddly (and barely functional if you're using a controller), the user interface is cluttered up with pointless ♥♥♥♥♥ such as artificially generated twitter posts, and you have to restart the whole bloody game if you want to alter the graphics options, and sit through approximately 9 hours worth of opening splash screens each time. Hell, you can't even adjust volume levels while in the pause menu, you have to exit back to the main menu; and how exactly are you expected to know where to set the volume levels when you're not driving?The driving mechanics and car selection certainly don't make up for this either. While Project Cars does seem to offer a dazzling selection of manufacturers and models at a glance, on closer inspection it is apparent that ~70% of the cars available are lazily designed, ugly, soulless race-cars which, quite honestly, all drive identically.The biggest let-down with Project Cars, however, is the appalling career mode. Instead of sticking to the classic formula of the old Gran Turismo and Forza titles, this game adopts the insipid ""racing contract"" system of the famously lifeless Codemasters racing games. Earning credits, finally getting your hands on that gorgeous Jaguar and at last having the power at your fingertips to win greater titles has always been part of the fun of racing simulators; this game throws it away completely. On starting a career, the game railroads you into a tediously narrow selection of cars, then forces you to keep using one for an entire season. What's more, you're stuck with the utterly bland LM racecars right from the start, so there's also no feeling of progress whatsoever in this supposed ""career"" mode. The calendar design is intrusive, and sometimes kicks you into round 4 of a race without choice, skipping the qualifying and practice rounds; I can only speak for myself here but being forced to race on a track I've never seen, in a car I don't like, starting in 20th place isn't exactly fun.Don't be fooled by this game; it may look appealing on first glance, but believe me, you're looking for something else.

												This game is unlike any other racing game. Now I know you here that phrase used all the time and trust me I get tired of hearing it too but trust me, this is unlike any racing game out there. The immersion is so incredible and the graphics are so good that (no joke) it actually looks like real life. I looked up Project CARS on google just to see some amazing screenshots and one of them was actually real life but for the first 10 to 15 secs I thought it was the game...-UI: The UI is very clean and crisp. Everything is easy to find and manage. Only gripe is that changing your liveries for cars requires you to go to your garage and change it from there instead of the quick car list. (Not a big deal but still worth mentioning). 10/10-Singleplayer: I haven't even started a career yet but I assume it's amazing. As for just random racing, it's amazing. You can add up to 55 cars (most I've seen at least) on the track at once which was at Le Mans and can also have multi class so you can simulate the 24 Hours of Le Mans or 24 Hours of Nurburgring. 9/10-AI: AI is a bit iffy. They are quite a challenge if you have it at 100 and do make mistakes on there own but seem to not even care your on the road. 7/10-Multiplayer: This is where I have spent the most time on, mainly cause it is actual people and I like that more. Everything runs smooth and the people for the most part are nice and aren't trolls/wreck everything. Getting together with your buddies is a breeze. This is by far my favorite part of the game. 10/10Bugs/Crashes: The only crash I have experienced was on Spa Francorchamps and my screen froze but the audio continued. I had to CTRL+ALT+DEL to close it which kinda sucked but over all that is nothing compared to all the fun I have had. Basic Specs of my Setup: NVIDIA GTX 970 (EVGA)                                          i5 4590                                          8gb RAM			"

												if racing experience is what you are after, then this game is for your. The racing in this game feels great and not like in any other game. AI can occasionally ram you or be too aggressive, but in that it's simulating what real players do in online races ( not talking about the usual first turn incidents, talking about proper MP raricng) game still has some bugs to be ironed out, so perhaps you might want to wait for some time before you buy it, but if you like racing games in general, this title shouldn't miss from your library racing is what they promise and oh boy they deliver it !I have been playing other sims such as rFactor2 (demo only), AC, iRacing, and while each of them have great things about them, they also have bad things about them ( as does pCARS btw) but if you can afford to have more racing games, and I think you should always have most if not all of them, they you will definitely enjoy racing around, track selection is unmatched car selection is solid, although some exotic cars are missing ( ferrari, lambo) visually it's stunning, great weather effectsfull day-night transition makes it perfect for endurance racingMP can't comment on much, since I'm not much of a Mp player myself, but neat feature is Driver rating, that based on how clean or bad you drive, you will be put into MP with same sort of players 9/10 for now and once it's all polished it will be 10/10 for me highly recommend it			"

Disappointment. This game was terribly overhyped. In an attempt to do everything, the only thing they have gotten correct are the graphics (for nvidia). The rest of the game feels like it is a beta release. The fanboy steam community jerk off going on over this game must consist of console gamers. No one should be using the word ""sim"" to describe this.Oh yes it looks phenomenal if you have an nvidia card, but anyone who thinks these cars handle correctly and that the force feedback feels realistic obviously hasn't driven real cars before, or real sims for that matter. Cars don't spin just because you let off of the throttle before you even turn the wheel. The rubber band AI drive like teenagers who just got their license and can get away with antics like cutting corners bouncing their way through the grass. Damage is a joke other than cosmetic, you can plow head first into a wall and back up and continue like nothing happened. You can even shift without the clutch all through the RPM range without consequence on stick shift vehicles.The sounds are even a little off, and some (tire squeal for instance) are just straight up unrealistic. I mean judging by sound alone you can't tell if your brakes are squealing or your tires have locked up. If you love games like Gran Turismo and Forza, you are new to PC racing with a FF wheel (and blissfully ignorant), or you just want a racing game that looks great on your new monitor then this is for you. But if you want a simulation, know how driving a car should feel, have a triple screen setup, oculus rift, or an AMD card - STAY AWAY. Buy Assetto Corsa instead and save some cash. Or if graphics don't matter as much as physics/feel to you then iRacing is even better than this.			"

												I'll share my somewhat unique experience with this game, although perhaps not exactly a game review.  Shortly before purchasing Project Cars I became a fan of the show Top Gear.  Before watching the show, I had no interest in cars whatsoever.  Over the course of a few months and 21 series of Top Gear I developed a taste for cars and was learning the basics of racing terminology and mechanics.  Top Gear introduced me to the idea of track days.  I researched them and found at there are events every weekend where I live in Southern California.  I signed up for one at random and starting researching the track.  Shortly, I realized I had signed up to go to Willow Springs, which of course is in Project Cars.  I did over 250 laps in Project Cars on Willow Springs in the classic Ford Escort before I went and did my track day there.  For those interested, I drove my land yacht Kia Amanti at the track haha.  Project Cars was an OUTSTANDING preparatory tool for me.  As a novice to track days I was required to attend some short classes before we started and after each session.   The instructors would ask us about the turns, the straights, how our different types of passing were going, and so forth.  I restrained my arrogance verbally but could not help thinking in my head that I was miles ahead of my peers.  The teacher would explain what an apex was and use turn 9 as an example.  And I would listen thinking ""I already know where the apex is on that turn, I also know that the track dips just before the apex, I have decent idea of the speed I can take the corner at thanks to the accuracy of PCars and the similarities of my car to the Ford Escort.  I knew every turn.  Their apexes and exits.  I knew the race line.  I knew where the pits where.  And I also knew my limitations.  I knew the dangers of turn 1 and how likely I was to go off.  I knew that I could stay flat out through turn 2 and that I had to find the apex out of the passenger side window.   My first track was one of the most fun days of my life despite being in a terrible car.  And I have no doubt that my experience was deeply enhanced by my preparation in Project Cars.  Only flaw with Project Cars - No Top Gear test track in the game.  Make it a DLC.  Someone make a mod.  Something.  I wanna drive that track soooooooooooooooooo bad.  tl:dr Project Cars unquestionably made me very well prepared for my first track day in real life and has helped to further my enthusiasm for cars.  And its fun.  9.9/10			"

Unfinished ""Project"" lacking the ability to get a refund for a hammered out piece of crap that looks like something EA would unleash upon gamers.  CRASH! Surprise! Surprise? No surprise.

												Only buy this if you want to sim. That might seem obvious, but ultimately there is no 'game' here at all, other than the racing, sort of like Assetto Corsa.I prefer Gran Turismo for the car collecting and ton of preset races. That would make this into a game, in my opinion, if they had put any effort into the 'reasons' for opening the game, other than bombing round a track.Watch some videos thoughs, read some more reviews and you might decide if it's for you -- for me, however, the challenge:fun ratio is all wrong.

												Newest version of Project CARS alongside with currently availabe DLC is very different from the 1.0 version, and I can say that the game is gradually improving: framerates are better, developers are working on the car physics (there is a realistic car weight distribution, intertia), tire grip has also changed. Moreover the developers actively support the game searching for interesting content like Audi 90 IMSA GTO or McLaren F1 GTR Longtail and include it to the game. Recommended.			"

TL/DR REVIEW: Pretty goodProject CARS is a sim(cade) game with some of the best graphics in the industry and with physics are good enough to suspend my disbelief. It's super easy to set up a (private) mutliplayer session to drive around with some friends. The public lobby racing quality is, as expected, atrocious.Physics under and on the limit feel believable, however once you break loose car control feels very weird and badly simulated. For me driving itself is not as exciting and raw as in say Assetto Corsa, but for its low cost, possibility to race in a variety of weather conditions with a good amount of content in the base game, it is worthwhile. Note 1: I don't have any experience with the AI, so I can't comment on that. Note 2: I played with a wheel, and for the complete experience I recommend you to do the same.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. "

												Let me start by saying that I very nearly did not buy this title due to the negative feedback left here on Steam. Even when it was just £12 in the Humble Bundle I read a few recent reviews and thought maybe not, but then what the hell, why not, how bad can it possibly be?After loading up, electing to drive an Aston on Snetterton as a free run, all default settings except for loading the suggested Steam controller configuration I set off for my first lap, full of trepidation for just what a car crash this software was going to be, no pun intended. Well that was a surprise, I’m pleased to report that I’ve no idea what planet the other reviewers were on, but after 45 minutes of roaring around the track having great fun I’m pleased as punch that I bought this title.Previous reviewers have said it’s unplayable with the Steam Controller, that seems to have escaped me. Others have said they spent hours configuring it just to make it playable, guess I did spend 30 seconds loading the Steam Controller configuration. The graphics are apparently not up to other titles, not sure what these titles are, I thought they were awesome. I’m told that the fps is appalling, well I have mine capped at 60fps, and the game ran at exactly that at all times, and this is on a GTX960 with an i5 3570; maybe I need to go into the graphic settings and tweak them to get lower fps?!Maybe after just 45 minutes I’m not yet fully qualified to give a review, but I’m only doing so as I was nearly put off buying this title at £12 due to the reviews of others, and I think it is without doubt one hundred percent worth the money.

												I've been waiting and doing some research on racing games for the PC for a while.  I picked this up late in the game, cause PJC2 is coming out already next year, but it's still worth it if it's not in your library yet.  Just don't get too addicted.  Graphics are stunning, if you have the pc to run it.  **Don't get caught up with bumping all the settings up even if you have a high end gaming PC.  It causes a lot of unstabliity I found.  There's a guide I can link if you read this and are havin crashing problems, there's an issue with the xbox 360 controller for PC too... so it took me a minute to get the game stable.... but then the racing begins.You can get sucked into the experience in Project Cars in a heartbeat.  As far as online play (my peronsal favorite) .. GT3 is the most raced class of cars it seems, I guess because they're the most stable cars to drive at speed in the game.  There's good racers and then the track nazi's that want to cut you off and block you all over the course.. not too many of those guys though.  LOTTA FUN!			"

												This game is the closest thing to racing a car one can do without actually racing a car.It will give you the most lifelike experience of being inside exotica, hypercars, kit cars & high performance track optimised F1 open wheelers & grand tourers available.Get yourself a wheel, start with the training tools on, hone your times then take off the training wheels get some snacks and race against the best in the world.Record your times then compare them with realworld lap-videos and see how close or ahead you are of the real world records.Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Music 0/10Sound effects 10/10Replay value 8/10The attention to track detail in this game is just breathtaking - I've driven a real car around Bathurst (Being an Aussie) and although I wasn't going too fast or in an AMG merc every dip in the road, house on the side of the track, crest where the sun blinds you, cambre of the tarmac is absolutely perfect.Enjoy.

												This game suffered a lot with it's start... But, it's finally worth playing.The handling is somewhere between simulation and ""Grand Tourismo""It's far better than games like Forza, Grid, and the like but when it comes to being a simulatorAssetto has it beat. When it comes to being a fun and engaging driving game with physics that are pretty good, and consistent enough to hone real world skills with? This is where it wins.Full support for Occulus and Vive! That's right, full Vive support!You can play Assetto with the Vive but you have to run a hook program off of Oculuss home software to get it to work. This game supports it natively. The career mode in racing games is something I've always enjoyed. Something about working your way through the ranks and being tossed into cars I would never normally pic for myself is fun, presents challange and give a great experience. I play with a Logitech G27 and while my first review was REALLY negative because of the poor support for wheels, and the game forgetting your settings and a list of other issues, they seam to be worked out now and the game plays really well. If you want a sim style racer with a progress system but still the ability to just race any track with any car at any time, then this is for you. If you want a cade style racer look at Grid or the like, full on simulation, with no niceties Assetta (Seriously, non... A menu over haul and propper VR support would push that game up a bit but right now those things drag it down...but that's not this game so enough about that heh.) There is always iRacing but that's a pay to play game, and Simraceway is fantastic as well but I haven't checked in on it in a bit to see if it has VR support. A+ but they did need to go to summer school to get to that grade.			"

												This game is a decent racing game simulator, which is targeting people who at least have racing wheel controller. I try it with xbox controller and it's still hard to setting it for full potential. If you using keyboard or/and mouse to playing this game, I recommend you to not buy it. This is a racing sim afterall, without a proper tool, you cannot enjoy it.Pros:1. Customizable. You can set your car as you wish to adapt your playing styles2. Great graphic quality. Especially when you play it in ultra.3. Great simulation. Your car can be damaged and your engine can blow up if you’re not careful enough.4. Career gameplay is great, you play from the bottom to pro5. Great experience if you using VR or racing wheel.6. For now, multiplayer status is healthy. There’s even an event that you can play periodically.Cons:1. Very hard to play for full potential with keyboard and or mouse2. Playable but still not quite right to handle with controller3. Boring graphic design. The building seems just like a cube, and the trees very much bad copy paste.4. Button assignment is not responsive. Some button cannot be assigned and some clash with another input I already changed. 5. Just my opinion, but the car sound is kinda crap.6. AI looks like machine rather than human. They behavior is very stiff and predicable.7. Using assistance is very annoying and make you don't enjoy the game at all. It's almost take the control of the game. Very not recomended if you want some experience to play the game. But without it RIP mouse keyboard user.My Score is about 50/100			"

Especially when you play it in ultra.3. Great simulation. Your car can be damaged and your engine can blow up if you’re not careful enough.4. Career gameplay is great, you play from the bottom to pro5. Great experience if you using VR or racing wheel.6. For now, multiplayer status is healthy. There’s even an event that you can play periodically.Cons:1. Very hard to play for full potential with keyboard and or mouse2. Playable but still not quite right to handle with controller3. Boring graphic design. The building seems just like a cube, and the trees very much bad copy paste.4. Button assignment is not responsive. Some button cannot be assigned and some clash with another input I already changed. 5. Just my opinion, but the car sound is kinda crap.6. AI looks like machine rather than human. They behavior is very stiff and predicable.7. Using assistance is very annoying and make you don't enjoy the game at all. It's almost take the control of the game. Very not recomended if you want some experience to play the game. But without it RIP mouse keyboard user.My Score is about 50/100			"

												Wonderful graphics. Nice Lighting. Beautifully made cars. But all that glitters is not gold:There are three things that let this otherwise brilliant sim down, and they do so in a way that begins as an irritation and ends with utter frustration. 1. There is evidence that the developers have applied an unnecessary and very counter-productive control freakery over the  complete lack of user-adjustments in very key areas. While there are endless user preferences for graphics there are almost NONE regarding sound. I find it extraordinary that a sim of this beauty does not allow me to adjust relative sounds, AT ALL. Balance between ai, crowd, engine, user car, tyre noise, skid noise HAS to be user-oriented. It is no good to say ""we know what is best"" because everyone's sound systems are different and everyone's hearing is different.For me the ai sounds and crowd sounds become excruciatingly annoying. Without actually being there, the visceral aid of tyre scrub and squeel is absolutely vital, however good the force feedback is. Yet SMS have, despite thousands of requests to provide proper sound sliders, ignored these requests. Since those requests were made, well over a year ago, they have issued multiple patches and several addon packs, but they have not listened to an overwhelmingly popular request for sound balance sliders. This simple function cannot possibly be hard to implement.Without these sliders the whole sim for me is ruined. You might think that sound balance is not important, but it is a vital part of what makes a racing sim playable.2. Some cars have decent physics, but the majority of them default to understeer. An example is the otherwise excellent Lotus 25 in the classic pack DLC. They have ruined this car by making it almost impossible to get rid of the inherent understeer. While the L25 is commendably stable in a straight line it is just too easy to drive around bends, even if you set ridiculously loose rear suspension. BTW the power diff is the wrong way round compared to the description, and that brings me conveniently on to the next big issue:3. The user interface and total lack of proper explanations and help are staggeringly inept. The interface is designed like a trendy blog with large on-screen squares and fancy graphics, but none of them give any proper info. You spend an inordinate amount of time clicking back and forth between these glitzy menu items to no avail. The whole interface is counter-intuitive and laborious. Let's give an example of user setups, car setups and control setups. None of these functions have a clear way of saving preferences. One makes adjustments and hopes they stick, but they often do not. There is no menu that says ""save your user file HERE"". There is just a save button, but WHERE is this function saved TO? And how does one recall or load these preferences?The user driver naming, career mode and creation and saving is preposterously confusing and poorly done. I created then deleted several times a new driver / user name but in the pit menu my name is NOT linked to my chosen name but my Steam nickname. Why? I create a career name but it does not appear in the drop down list of drivers, so what is the point of choosing a career name? If I have misunderstood this then I acknowledge it, but why do I have to run through hoops to understand it, or rather not understand it?Now we come to saving car setups. This is as confusing as it is possibly to be. In ""My garage"" there is an option to choose a car and a livery. You can make a car setup here which is odd because you are not on a race track when you do so. How counter-intuitive is that! But if you first go to a quick race and try to save a setup there, in the very place where setups are relevant, you can't, or at least not reliably. There is a save button but it doesn't load later unless you FIRST make a car setup before you actually go to the race/pit menu. You have to go back to the My Garage menu, save a setup there, then edit and save it within the pit menu later. Again I might have misunderstood and there could be ways around it, but I do not see how.Moreover, the setup saving is badly explained and further confusing. There is an option to save to ""ALL"" or to the track you are currently at. But if you try to save to ""ALL"" there appears to be no evidence that it is saved. There is no drop down list of your saves. I find this incredible. It appears that you cannot pick or experiment with several different setups from a pre-saved list. There IS no list! As far as I can see, you can only save one setup per car per track. rFactor, GTL, and even GPL from sixteen years ago had his function!MANUAL======I see a link to a ""digital manual"" and go there. It is NOT a manual! It is a brief explanation of some of the functions, but there is no detail. For example there is no in depth explanation of the many parameters in Force Feedback and nor is there any detailed explanation of any other function. They are broad headings with a terse paragraph or two but no clear guide to every function. How can a developer spend years making a potentially great product and then not bother to write a decent manual? If you buy for example a flight sim addon, there are typically several user help documents, many of them running to hundreds of pages with summaries, details and every single function explained.Conclusion: This could be a wonderful sim. It would be so if the key areas are addressed, and they are a very poor user interface whose slick graphics hide an essentially confusing and clunky user experience, questionable physics which seem to me to be somewhat dumbed down for the sake of games consoles/arcade users and xbox-type controllers, and a complete lack of user control of essential sound balance options.

												For those who think it's too hard to drive with keyboard, well here's something for you to see:http://dai.ly/x5b6asdThe only problem with the above video is that it was recorded with the default graphics settings which was a little too high for my laptop PC so it was a bit sluggish with the steering and throttle response.After lowering some options and restarting the game and race, it was a much better driving experience. Lots of ways to tweak for best results. Game is good at  it's current 80% off discounted price but i got it from Humble Bundle with a few other games at about SGD$2 more. Though i've only started playing this, i can't forsee any problem with it. AI behaviour at Novice setting is quite tame. Car handling is not a problem at all with keyboard.It's a 2015 release yet very much compatible with my 2011 hardware. Get it if you're brave enough to try; worth the price for its content. 8/10Here is the retry after reducing resolution to 720p windowed and other reduction in details:

												I hate serious reviews; all I do is write goofy reviews. But I just rage quit this game again, so serious I'll be: This game is horrible. More succinctly: it's horrible for people that dont take it super seriously.I grew up on racing games; the more realistic, the better. Drove manual, turned off all assists, and never had issues. I do amateur motorsports for fun in real life and in general play around with the physics of cars to learn. The more, the better.Then this game came along. I presumed there'd be a learning curve, but otherwise I know I'd at least enjoy it based on what I've seen and read. So I bought it, installed it, and have spent however many HOURS fighting with it. Tweaking controller settings and tweaking controller settings AND TWEAKING CONTROLLER SETTINGS. There are people that can play this game with no issues, but for whatever reason it is ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to make it where it's comfortable and FUN to play. I KNOW how cars behave; I understand the tiny nuances that can alter/affect vehicle handling. I ♥♥♥♥ing GET physics. But despite knowing that, this crazy-♥♥♥ simulation never feels right. The biggest issue is that cars are twitchy and lose grip out of nowhere with no indication or warning. For whatever reason, that kind of feedback is not put into the controller. So I can't count how many times I've completed turns as smoothly as possible and I STILL end up seeing the inside wall from sudden, magical oversteer when exiting a turn.There are plenty of other horrible things about this game like a magical AI that have perfect lines, jacked up power, and adhesive ultra-soft tires when you crank the difficulty. The sound is janky with all noises except your engine being loud as ♥♥♥♥. I have all sounds except my engine turned down to 60% and I STILL hear some AI car 100 feet behind me more than I hear my own engine. Overall vehicle choice is incredibly imbalanced and lacking in variety, DLC car packs are usually random crap with no real value. The cursor never goes away despite the fact that I'm using a controller, so I always have to reach out and move the cursor off the screen. Controller settings are CONSTANTLY being reset. Random lock ups and crashes abound. Plus whenever you're in the zone and concentrating on finding an opening to pass, that IDIOT pit chief starts yapping and it makes me lose it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. No way to turn him off, either. I know how to strategize my own movements, I don't need pre-recorded garbage chirping in when I need distraction the least.Just so many tiny things that add up to the THE most disappointing game purchase I think I've ever made. I was ready to adore this game and all that ever happens is I try to play and I end up screaming so much my throat hurts and rage quit 10 minutes later. To me it's an ultra simulation that requires a wheel and insane amounts of tinkering to be able to enjoy. There's no fun ""out of the box"", and it's for that reason I can't recommend this game. Not to casual gamers like myself that would rather play a game than tinker with it to no avail.			"

												For starters the game is very fun, and it looks gorgeous. I don't regret choosing it for my first PC racing game. In career mode I will say though that Kart One racing is VERY frustrating. The handling of the kart is just... stupid. Super Kart (the next tier) is much better, though it can feel unstable at high speeds. Rookie Formula is where things get pretty good. Throughout the game, the AI can be... a little inconsiderate. The moment I go off the track and into the grass, it's as if I'm not there to them. You can imagine what happens when I try to merge back onto the track. At the moment there are a couple bugs, one being that the racing guide line doesn't display the color green sometimes and only displays yellow and red. This can be a pain if I'm new to a track and don't have an idea of proper speed in certain spots yet. This is a rare bug mind you. I also think the game has an oversight in fuel load calculations. A max fuel load in Formula A (only time I noticed it) didn't provide me enough fuel to run a full length race, and in Formula A refueling during the race isn't available. Either I did something wrong with my tuning setup or it's an oversight and needs to be fixed, otherwise I'm stuck running 50% length races. All in all, the game is great. Lots of pros to outweight the few cons. If you have a racing wheel or plan on getting one, you should consider getting this game. It's a good deal for the price.			"

												G29 USERS READ THIS!!! I bought a G29 a few months ago as a birthday present to myself. Never been really any good at racing games (still not) and the purchase was for use with the Euro Truck & American Truck series by SCS. However, recently i've felt the need for speed and decided to take the plunge with Project Cars.Worked with my G29 straight away after I told it which control scheme I wanted and it does utilise full the 900 degree turn that the wheel has AS STANDARD meaning no fiddling. I bought the game with all the DLC included as it was on sale for a reasonable price so I can't comment on what the base game has, however with all the DLC you will be entertained for hours. I know, at the time of this review my hours played will be low but I see myself playing this game a lot more now and in the future. My only gripe is for any graphical changes you need to restart your game. Thats annoying. 9/10			"

												The developers of Project Cars have nailed the driving experience to perfection.  The cars and tracks look fantastic, the graphics are superb and the user interface is intuitive.  Replaying your best performances is a joy.  There are some superb racing simulators on the market, e.g Assetto Corsa but Project Cars just pips it by a head.  I haven't played Dirt Rally but the review feedback looks very promising.  But if you are after a track bonanza then look no further than Project Cars. WELL DONE SLIGHTLY MAD STUDIO's for this game.Purchase 20 games on STEAM this month and this is at the top of the list for replayability and sheer fun.  Witcher 3 and GTA5 are taking a back seat to this game.			"

												This game is dank asflogged around 240 hours on console on this game, got it on pc however the playablitlity has worn off slightly now. of course there are problems, you could be driving normal take a corner slow but still spin out, idk wtf is going on there.however the graphics are still great even to now and it's almost 2 years old. the slection of cars are amazing, of course it would be great if they didnt charge money for the extra ""DLC"" carsCan't wait for project cars 2 like			"

												Wonderful graphics. Nice Lighting. Beautifully made cars. But all that glitters is not gold:There are three things that let this otherwise brilliant sim down, and they do so in a way that begins as an irritation and ends with utter frustration. 1. There is evidence that the developers have applied an unnecessary and very counter-productive control freakery over the  complete lack of user-adjustments in very key areas. While there are endless user preferences for graphics there are almost NONE regarding sound. I find it extraordinary that a sim of this beauty does not allow me to adjust relative sounds, AT ALL. Balance between ai, crowd, engine, user car, tyre noise, skid noise HAS to be user-oriented. It is no good to say ""we know what is best"" because everyone's sound systems are different and everyone's hearing is different.For me the ai sounds and crowd sounds become excruciatingly annoying. Without actually being there, the visceral aid of tyre scrub and squeel is absolutely vital, however good the force feedback is. Yet SMS have, despite thousands of requests to provide proper sound sliders, ignored these requests. Since those requests were made, well over a year ago, they have issued multiple patches and several addon packs, but they have not listened to an overwhelmingly popular request for sound balance sliders. This simple function cannot possibly be hard to implement.Without these sliders the whole sim for me is ruined. You might think that sound balance is not important, but it is a vital part of what makes a racing sim playable.2. Some cars have decent physics, but the majority of them default to understeer. An example is the otherwise excellent Lotus 25 in the classic pack DLC. They have ruined this car by making it almost impossible to get rid of the inherent understeer. While the L25 is commendably stable in a straight line it is just too easy to drive around bends, even if you set ridiculously loose rear suspension. BTW the power diff is the wrong way round compared to the description, and that brings me conveniently on to the next big issue:3. The user interface and total lack of proper explanations and help are staggeringly inept. The interface is designed like a trendy blog with large on-screen squares and fancy graphics, but none of them give any proper info. You spend an inordinate amount of time clicking back and forth between these glitzy menu items to no avail. The whole interface is counter-intuitive and laborious. Let's give an example of user setups, car setups and control setups. None of these functions have a clear way of saving preferences. One makes adjustments and hopes they stick, but they often do not. There is no menu that says ""save your user file HERE"". There is just a save button, but WHERE is this function saved TO? And how does one recall or load these preferences?The user driver naming, career mode and creation and saving is preposterously confusing and poorly done. I created then deleted several times a new driver / user name but in the pit menu my name is NOT linked to my chosen name but my Steam nickname. Why? I create a career name but it does not appear in the drop down list of drivers, so what is the point of choosing a career name? If I have misunderstood this then I acknowledge it, but why do I have to run through hoops to understand it, or rather not understand it?Now we come to saving car setups. This is as confusing as it is possibly to be. In ""My garage"" there is an option to choose a car and a livery. You can make a car setup here which is odd because you are not on a race track when you do so. How counter-intuitive is that! But if you first go to a quick race and try to save a setup there, in the very place where setups are relevant, you can't, or at least not reliably. There is a save button but it doesn't load later unless you FIRST make a car setup before you actually go to the race/pit menu. You have to go back to the My Garage menu, save a setup there, then edit and save it within the pit menu later. Again I might have misunderstood and there could be ways around it, but I do not see how.Moreover, the setup saving is badly explained and further confusing. There is an option to save to ""ALL"" or to the track you are currently at. But if you try to save to ""ALL"" there appears to be no evidence that it is saved. There is no drop down list of your saves. I find this incredible. It appears that you cannot pick or experiment with several different setups from a pre-saved list. There IS no list! As far as I can see, you can only save one setup per car per track. rFactor, GTL, and even GPL from sixteen years ago had his function!MANUAL======I see a link to a ""digital manual"" and go there. It is NOT a manual! It is a brief explanation of some of the functions, but there is no detail. For example there is no in depth explanation of the many parameters in Force Feedback and nor is there any detailed explanation of any other function. They are broad headings with a terse paragraph or two but no clear guide to every function. How can a developer spend years making a potentially great product and then not bother to write a decent manual? If you buy for example a flight sim addon, there are typically several user help documents, many of them running to hundreds of pages with summaries, details and every single function explained.Conclusion: This could be a wonderful sim. It would be so if the key areas are addressed, and they are a very poor user interface whose slick graphics hide an essentially confusing and clunky user experience, questionable physics which seem to me to be somewhat dumbed down for the sake of games consoles/arcade users and xbox-type controllers, and a complete lack of user control of essential sound balance options.

It's a sim this is how it is supposed to be!!I am using a xbox 360 controller and it feels ok with me,but I think a gaming steering will be perfect for this game!The best part is you can use a vr to play this game!Gaming steering wheel and vr with this game is going to be awesome.For me this is the perfect vr game!My rating is 9.0/10 !

Damn, I played GT so much, the awful sound is the first thing came to mind when comparing every sims to them.- Great physics and force feed back. DOES require time and searching for optimal settings. Kudos to JackSpade's ffb tunings & Roccafellas G29 settings.- The best Racing Sim ever created Imo. GT5/6 is just a DRIVING sim, not even close to Racing, preriod. Forza? People call them Sim? Not even close, well I played FM3,4 on my X360 & Fanatec GT2 and I do know how it feels.- Good Career mode.Bad ♥♥♥♥♥:- Stupid F uking AI. Yep, they do provide the thrill and challenge but way too aggressive and stupid driving. They always have one target: crash the F you out of the race. Annoying as F, but you know, still the best AI out there, it would be perfect if SMS fix their stupid behaviour.- Although the physic is good but the cars feel so light, one small touch and you'll get spinned out of the track. WTF? GT5/6 is better in this aspect.- Not many cars & tracks as competitors. Ok so should you buy it?

												A year with the game, only 85+ hours with it due to time constraints... It's much better than it was on initial release, excellent feel, good selection of cars and better selection of tracks. DLC material is decent, some surprises, and some stuff that's not that useful (mojave desert track is pointless). UI is better than what GT has offered but still annoying to use. Stability under Win10 is a bit rough sometimes and generally speaking there are issues with getting the game running in full screen (like now with the latest Oculus related update). The main point is that playing the actual game is really good. I just hope they sort out the menus and UI, and simplify the tweaking of cars which is overly complex (examples in video of changes and their consequences would have been nice), as nothing's ever really explained to anyone (that's not just this game btw).

It's relaxing to pick a car and track combination and just go at it, a good stress buster.To it's credit, this game has improved my racing in other games.

												This game is a decent racing game simulator, which is targeting people who at least have racing wheel controller. I try it with xbox controller and it's still hard to setting it for full potential. If you using keyboard or/and mouse to playing this game, I recommend you to not buy it. This is a racing sim afterall, without a proper tool, you cannot enjoy it.Pros:1. Customizable. You can set your car as you wish to adapt your playing styles2. Great graphic quality. Especially when you play it in ultra.3. Great simulation. Your car can be damaged and your engine can blow up if you’re not careful enough.4. Career gameplay is great, you play from the bottom to pro5. Great experience if you using VR or racing wheel.6. For now, multiplayer status is healthy. There’s even an event that you can play periodically.Cons:1. Very hard to play for full potential with keyboard and or mouse2. Playable but still not quite right to handle with controller3. Boring graphic design. The building seems just like a cube, and the trees very much bad copy paste.4. Button assignment is not responsive. Some button cannot be assigned and some clash with another input I already changed. 5. Just my opinion, but the car sound is kinda crap.6. AI looks like machine rather than human. They behavior is very stiff and predicable.7. Using assistance is very annoying and make you don't enjoy the game at all. It's almost take the control of the game. Very not recomended if you want some experience to play the game. But without it RIP mouse keyboard user.My Score is about 50/100			"

												Sadly, all in all I regret buying this game. Replaying it now after over a year didn't bring the patches I was hoping for. It still feels not completed.I was hyped while I was following other channels beta tests but in the end Project CARS feels really empty and shallow to me. The selection of cars is, at least for me, not that great and mostly also not that interesting. The game looks okay, as long as you stay on the track. The damage model isn't really that present. Sure, it's there but doesn't react properly to whatever crash you're involved with. Hitting a wall with 150 miles doesn't do much - plus the sounds aside from the engines are terrible and/or not present enough. What annoyed me a lot even though it's really just a minor detail are the sparks - they just look so damn bad that almost every PS1 game would do a better job. I'm puzzled how the creaters saw that and still thought it was okay for being in the final release. Also, sometimes I had that feeling I'm playing Ridge Racer, seeing how my car just bumped from the walls like a bouncy ball. Playing with my Driving Force GT was pretty okay. In the other hand, trying to play it with the XBOX One controller was absolutely frustrating next to impossible.It's pretty close to that strange Gran Turismo feeling. You play it and you're trying really hard to have fun with the game since you're driving a nice car and all while trying to nail some nice laps. In the end, maybe you had fun, but you aren't that sure about it. Having no real tasks in this game is a kinda frustrating thing, too.Now I find myself playing the 10-year old Race Driver:GRID again. Sure, it's not a simulator, but it's at least fun and did pretty much everything better than Project CARS.			"

However, if you like racing games like Forza where you can upgrade various parts of your cars, and where you can buy the cars you use in ""Career"" mode, this may not be the game for you.  I really did like that part of Forza, and Project CARS doesn't have it.  It is, regardless, an excellent game.			"

Superb VR support, combined with a half decent racing wheel, and you really freaking feel like you are in a racecar (or racecart).  Hours upon hours of intense fun and the best game out right now if you have the above equipment.			"

												Great racing sim game, but original force feedback (FFB) are too real accurate, need other tweaker files like Jack Spade etc. to make it more entertainment and more detail feeling from road, tire and car's status (G-force)...But it still a very great sim racing game, must buy!			"

												For those curious about how the game runs on AMD systems as of 02/10/16My specs: FX-8350 @4.0ghz, R9-290X, 16gb ram, 1080p. Latest AMD drivers installed.In game graphics settings: FXAA=HIGH (no other AA turned on), textures, enviroment, track detail=HIGH. Shadows, particles, grass=MEDIUM. Car detail=ULTRA.Tested for about an hour on only a couple of tracks and weather settings. Seems like those are the main things that affect FPS. With clear weather and daytime it mostly stayed around 60 but then I tried a race with heavy thunderstorms and it stayed around 25-45fps the entire time. Luckily when it does drop frames it's not too jarrring (like an action game would be for example) and is still very playable. Some tracks and weather conditions affect performance more than others and you probably won't have a stable framerate all the time. Because of this problem I don't recommend you buy the game at full price if you're playing on AMD hardware, I got it for 60% off and i'm fairly happy with it. Certainly not the best running game ever but not Arkham Knight either.			"

												I quite like this game. I play using the Logitech G27 racing wheel and I find that it works very well with Project Cars. The graphics are great and the sounds are as well. The only drawback in my opinion is the car selection. I love racing the GT cars and whatnot but I would love to see a large road car pack to be released, even if it cost a fair bit. I came from Forza 4 which had many road cars and It was a lot of fun to challenge your friends in slower cars, especially the ones you could hope to own, and I think that this aspect would be even better on this game. Overall this game is a huge jump from forza and definitely on the same level if not better than Assetto Corsa.			"

												** edit 7/1/15Although they still haven't fixed the bug with the car setup resetting when entering the pitbox during career practice, I feel there have been a significant amount of bug fixes that I can change this to a recommended. The game is playable as long as I do my car setups in free practice sessions outside of the career mode.  Its not ideal, but there is no denying the gameplay is excellent and graphics are beautiful; recent bug fixes have improved performance in general.**edit 6-12-15**patch 1.4 still does not resolve the car setup problems.  Steam cloud sync is also an option available but ""not implemented, most devs stopping using it because it caused game crashes"".  **edit** a major patch (1.4) has been announced to address many of the bugs, however no release date has been announced as of today (6/10/15)I currently can't recommend this game.  If slightly mad studios would release some bug fixes, I might change my mind.  It seems they're more concerned with fixing bugs on XBOX.I waited for pCars to come out for a year...It's been out for a month and I haven't played it since the first week of release because of game breaking bugs that I do not have the time to work around.  The biggest one being that the car setup resets itself every time you come into the pits during practice.  This means that to tune your car, you have to write down every change you made and then redo them all to make a simple tweak to the setup. You'll also have to redo them for every session (qual and race). I also run an AMD R9  290 which was a big investment a year ago and it struggles with the high settings to keep 60fps due to the lack of AMD support (which they claim is an AMD driver issue, funny I don't have any other games affected by this issue that weren't poorly designed in the first place).pCars was plagued by delays to release a ""more polished version"" but I think it was still premature.  Now they have the audacity to sell us DLC's. The only bug fix they released was almost an insult it was so lacking in real bug fixes.  I was also unimpressed with the force feedback settings; they're over complicated (only devs would know what half the settings do) and the user guide doesn't explain themWait for a sale and some bug fixes before you invest into this game.

												This game definetly has some perks, but i can't reccomend it, it has 0 customazation whatsoever, which i always thought was 50% of the fun in Forza or any other racing sim. the only cool thing about this is the contracts, and team sign ons, thats pretty cool, but you dont make moeny at all, so its kind of pointless, its not like any specific team is better than another, theyre jsut random names. when you sign on, it will give you a brief description on what kind of races youll be in. for example, the junior gt40, what does that even mean? lol sounds to me like go kart racing, which they do ahve BTW.  Pros:team sign onrealistic driving (somewhat)game runs smoothlythere is a qualifying roundCons:no customizationno currencytuning is not in depthcant chane tuning units (wtf does 1.8 bar mean?, how about some PSI here?)game seems more like work than actually fun, i would place 20th in the qualifying, but first in the race? i guess...game is difficult to navigateyou have no idea what your getting into when you sign the contractevery race all the vehicles are the same (i guess not bad for some, but i prefer vareity)if you like Forza or Gran Turismo, DO NOT BUY THIS you will be dissappointed			"

												I'm actually having loads of fun with this one.Dev's are taking care of it even after launch, with V 6.0 just being released 2 weeks ago. Patching and fixing whatever is found, adding more options to races (Timed races , like in the Endurance series, are coming too), and the DLCs are not too shaby when taken for bang for your buck.Overall, after 200 Hours, so far i can recommend it. No, it's not perfect (show me a game that is), but all the major bugs have been iron'd out...Plus, it has Oculus Rift DK2 support!			"

												For those curious about how the game runs on AMD systems as of 02/10/16My specs: FX-8350 @4.0ghz, R9-290X, 16gb ram, 1080p. Latest AMD drivers installed.In game graphics settings: FXAA=HIGH (no other AA turned on), textures, enviroment, track detail=HIGH. Shadows, particles, grass=MEDIUM. Car detail=ULTRA.Tested for about an hour on only a couple of tracks and weather settings. Seems like those are the main things that affect FPS. With clear weather and daytime it mostly stayed around 60 but then I tried a race with heavy thunderstorms and it stayed around 25-45fps the entire time. Luckily when it does drop frames it's not too jarrring (like an action game would be for example) and is still very playable. Some tracks and weather conditions affect performance more than others and you probably won't have a stable framerate all the time. Because of this problem I don't recommend you buy the game at full price if you're playing on AMD hardware, I got it for 60% off and i'm fairly happy with it. Certainly not the best running game ever but not Arkham Knight either.			"

												Great game... good selection of cars, great driving dynamics, great audio and great graphics. I have hundreds of hours logged playing gran turismo and many other racing games and so far, this is my favorite. The two things I wish it had are a wider array of production cars so I could drive my own car or something like it and performance upgrades on those cars. Thats one of my favorite parts of gran turismo that this game doesnt have. However, the things this game does, it does well. I bought iRacing and it is a good game but I like this better. I would much rather pay the 1 time price of this game than all the nickle and dime stuff that iRacing pulls. Not to mention this game loads much faster and doesnt have the stupid browser based login. The saddest thing of all, iRacing was released in 2008 where as this game was released in 2015. A 7 year headstart and project cars has already surpassed them in my opinion.			"

												I already loved this game, because for me it's an almost perfect arcade/sim blend. That's all realy up to personal preference though. What isn't, is that Project CARS looks great. The latest update added VR support. I've played several races with my Vive now, and after I finish this review I plan on jumping back in, and not leaving the cockpit for a long while. The immersion is great, and it runs perfectly fine on my FX-8350, 8GB of whatever DDR3 was cheap, and R9 Fury.Now back to crashing.			"

												A sublime, true motorsports game that finally feels like actual racing.One of the best parts of the game is that it stays to true to real racing; from karting to GT3 to Formula racing cars the authenticity of the career is simply unmatched. I love that the game doesn't punish me from not being the best driver, but I can actually focus on just trying my best against a huge grid of AI drivers that actually feel like human. I like that race weekend are properly simulated, but you can still individually pick the length of the race in percentages of the real life length. I like that the pit engineer actually gives relevant information for the race and for a slightly novice driver like me it's really helpful, not to mention it's pretty cool to have Ben Collins as the voice. The main downsides of the career so far have been lack of podium animations and some extra atmospherics stuff as well as partly missing pit animations, but luckily those are coming soon with a patch.The physics of the game feel very, very realistic too and you really have to manage your steering, your gas, your weight transfers, your tire temperatures and other. At the same time it doesn't feel alienating hard; you can pick up a car and drive it, but to truly compete you need a bit of practice with each car. The simulated weather conditions bring life to the racing as changing temperatures affect the grip, rain can wary from slight dribble to proper storms and you have to go change your tires. Proper 24h racing on all tracks is absolutely amazing as well and that combined with the realistic tracks makes the racing so amazing. Each car feels unique and you have to learn and tune the charasteristic to your taste. Only a few cars feel a slightly off and the default settings are very ""safe"" for new drivers, but overall the physics are sublime (apart from collisions, which don't feel so good all the time).It also looks stunning on my computer with a i920 and 280X, even though some AMD drivers issues haven't been fixed yet the performance is pretty good too. I especially love how the rain looks and the different conditions feel so life-like. Cars also look very good and detailed, though the car roster could certainly use some more cars, but right now the game offers such a huge variety of different motorsports it's obvious some concessions had to be made to achieve the vision of having so many racing series.So overall, I can't help but to recommend this to anyone who loves cars and motorsports. Novices might need to take a moment to learn the game and use some assists, but the game is still fairly easy to pick up. Even though I absolutely adore Assetto Corsa, rFactor, GTR 2, Gran Turismo and Forza......Project CARS is the racing game of the generation.			"

												This is a great game, I have no issues other than a few minor things.  The graphics is superb if your machine can handle it.  The cars and tracks selection is a little on the down side compared to Gran Turismo 6.  But unlike GT6 all of their cars are well detailed inside and out.  The control and car setup settings are a little initmidating if you are new to racing games, but if you are not there are a lot of adjustments you can make to fine tune the controls and gameplay to your liking.  I play this game using a logitech DFGT which has 900 degree rotation so the game seemed to think I wanted to turn all those degrees to go around a corner.  But after i adjusted the rotation degrees limit to 360 in the logitech profiler (which is not in game) the turning control was a lot better. The career mode is fun and again you can adjust how you want to play.  For example you can start racing GT cars right away or start from the bottom in the go kart league and work your way to the top.  In every race you can adjust the AI and the amount of laps you want.The multiplayer is fun, you have warm up sessions and qualifying before the race.  The only problem is expect dirty drivers that will bump you off the road.			"

												Love this game.. absolutely love itfrom the way the rain runs off the windscreen down to the way the mitsy lancer ♥♥♥♥♥ its rear leg when you really push itRunning with a fanatec csr wheel with csr pedals and a logitec H shifter (maybe occasionally using my warthog flight stick as a hydralic style handbreak when sliding about because i have yet to buy the fanatec handbreak)this game can be a interesting race sim aswell as a noobie auto assist arcade like game (that means its eligeble for my 3 year old nephew can be laughing his head off doing doghnuts for hoursall along the whole time i wish that in a way there was more forza 4 like elements.. (forza 4 has been my yard stick to measure all racing games and sims by) with its customability and easy to navigate tuning pages, easy car sharing and a in bult decal and design features made forza one of the greatest racing games ever (in my opinion) so there is always a big space in this game that leaves me wishing i could be driving more personalised cars and the tuning element bringing a whole different aproach to racing and getting together online with friendsall in all a ****ing good game and as long as more dlc cars (preferably more slideways ones as well as rally based) is on the way.. there is still a couple of little bugs that need looking into but for certain nothing game breaking (eg pagani zonda if u turn the wheel and drivers arms off in the cockpit the wheel mounted rev needle still apears were the wheel used to be) lil nit picky things tbh.when this game first came out i was not impressed and after reading multiple reviews was about to ask for a refund for such a broken game, so i put the game down for a while and kept with asseto corsa (another top marks sim). after a little while giving what i thought was a fair time to iron out the creases i found there was still bugs (like car lights shining clearly through solid surfaces in fog) but the game was definately playable.. i short while after 99% of bugs had gone leaving only the nit pics i mentioned earlyersorry for the long review (just verry passionate about the genre)			"

												I've played a heap of racing games over the last 29 years and this one has really annoyed me. Riddled with weird bugs that like to jump out at you at random times and a draving feel that feels terrible. Each car feels exactly the same in that they all handle like you're on ice. It's such a strange driving experience and it's very annoying. I've played the ♥♥♥♥ off Gran Turismo 1,2,3,4,5 etc and the Forza games and each car feels slightly different be it heavy, tail happy, understeering, fast on the acceleration or a mix of a few and so on. However, unfortunatly, the vehicles here all feel like you're playing Car Curling. Y'know the one, a long path of ice and you throw a heavy weight down it? This is what this game feels like. Point the car forward, accelerate and hope the wind or some other force of nature just happens to move you from side to side. Very unpredictable driving and a serious let down.			"

												For now, it needs a clearer way of describing proper button mapping. Simplifying the button map process to make it more user friendly. I have a Fanatec Porsche GT2, combined with a CSR Elite pedal set and CSR shifter. I have been trying to set this up for 6 hours now, and it's slowly starting to frustrate me. Sometimes the pedals will respond, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they only half respond. Adjusting pedal sensitivity doesn't tell me what they do, they seem to respond the same. Graphically, it's rather pleasing. The physics are quite good, and a road car responds how I would expect it to as I drive and push the weight around.			"

												If you're in the market for a racing sim, just get this already. This is one of the top, if not THE top racing sim out right now. Sure, it isn't exactly the ultra-realistic sim that it was hyped up to be but the superb quality of the sounds and graphics make up for it. If I needed more realism, I'd just go out and drive.I use the g27 racing wheel with this and it already has good presets for it so any set-up you have to do for it is just for your preferences.The devs are putting out solid updates as promised which is nice. Few DLCs have come out which are very nice considering they're very cheap.Car selection is very nice. Unfortunately, if you're a JDM fan you'll feel a little left out but so many other great cars are included that it doesn't bother me at all that some of my favorites aren't on here yet. I feel like I remember something being said about one free car per month or something like that, but I don't think any free car updates have come out since the Lykan Hypersport, which was supposed to be the first in the line of free updates. Not really something I'm worried about though.Basically my only complaint is that shifting is very forgiving, I'm not sure if there's an option beyond choosing the most advanced/least assisted play style to fix it. Not fully depressing the clutch and shifting usually has no consequences at all. You can also downshift without rev matching without consequence unless you're just way out of the correct RPM range and you blow your engine.  This is probably the kind of thing that would take a ton of effort to implement just for a tiny improvement anyway.The career portion of the game is pretty fun. I mostly just do free practice/time trial though.			"

												This game is beautiful. Game mechancis are magnificent when it comes to the career mode and to even quicl races where the game lets you customise everything. Customising weather, how many cars participate, what kind of cars, how will the weather change throughout the race, difficulty to opponents and to how many laps you have to do. When playing this game in cockpit view is most immersive racing experience I've ever had, even without my VR headset. The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a racing game and the driving feels great.I play with an xbox controller or the wheel so I haven't had any issues with controls as I've heard other people been having with keyboard or other.I totally still play this to date because of how immersive it is and never really get bored with it.

												Ranks right up there with Elite:Dangerous in VR experiences. The latest update(.7) works wonderfully with the Oculus DK2. The depth perception a VR headset can offer will really help you judge those apexes. Looks great on a monitor with the settings jacked.There are a ton of car classes however it comes at the expense of number of cars per class. I favor road cars(FORZA PLEASE COME TO PC) and would have liked to have seen more consumer level options. C'est la vie.The driving itself I only know with the 360 controller. Would love a new wheel but simply don't have the space. Controller racing is fine. A little twitchy at first gotta play with those deadzones.Online community seems scarse but I haven't run into a lot of a-hole drivers, which is nice.

												A wheel is a MUST HAVE for this simulator! (THIS IS NOT A GAME)To get the most from this racing title you will want to invest in a steering wheel. I personally recommend the Logitech G27 as it is a complete unit. This means a clutch and stand-alone'H' style shifter are included and are not an add-on purchase like some setups currently available. Plus the stainless steel paddle shifters and rev LED lights are a nice touch.You are able to configure this simulator to your liking, making it as easy or difficult as you like. Still definitely not an arcade racer though. Sorry NFS fanboys!This is the closest thing you can get to the real thing without killing yourself!10 out of 10 Turbo blow offs!!! "

												Project CARs is a realistic real-world racing simulation intended to bring together the most diehard racing fans from accross the world. Project CARS was released in Mid 2015 after a delay in production and has been releasing patches to improve the game ever since. After playing this game through many months of development, I have found the graphics are very appealing to the eye and certainly draw in race enthusiasts to the pleasing graphics of the game. Unfortunately, the asthetics and logic behind the game, especially the artificial intellegence are not quite up to par. After many patches were released in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the artificial intellegence, there was little changed, subsequently resulting in many deficcient release patches. This game is very useable with an easy to manage interface, and an in-depth career mode that will take you from zero to hero. The graphics and user interface of Project CARS are very unique in its class like no other, but is balanced out by an in-efficient artificial intellegence system within the game. The physics engine is for the most part very realistic with a few minor bumps in the road that can surely be fixed in the future. Other bugs include usability issues with the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. Often times during a race, the will will simply disconnect and you must reboot the game in order to continue gameplay. Positives Qualities:-Pleasing Graphics-Easy To manage User Interface-On Par Physics EngineNegative Qualities:-Below Par Asthetics-Unreliable Artificial Intellegence- Bug And Compatibility Issues Exist Within the GameWhile the graphics and user interface are easy to manage, the main focal point of the game which includes the artificial intellegence and gameplay are not always relaible and are twitchy eight times out of ten. This makes the game discouraging for the user playing it and will surely have many players leaving in no time. I do think Project CARS has potential for the future, but Slightly Mad Studios needs to get Slightly More Mad in order to win over the ratings with this one.Rating: 7/10			"

												I love racing games and Project CARS is the pinnacle of the genre.  It's been a long time coming and has actually drawn me away from Assetto Corsa.  This game is for sim lovers however does have many options to make it more accessible to the more casual gamer.  Normally, sim games are not your first idea of fun however playing it multiplayer with some other great gamers I know, it can turn out to be a great experience comparable to many other games out there.The main selling point for CARS (other than the racing experience) was the graphics.  They are beautiful even when you are not running everything maxed out.  Thankfully, SlightlyMad has left many options to tweak the visual appearance to suit your own preferences.  Don't like JJ Abrams  lens flare?  Yeah you can disable it or go through and select the type you like.The attention to detail is quite impressive.  The first time you get to race in a BAC Mono is an impressive.  The car model shows every curve and line from suspension arms to the exhaust in so much detail that you sometimes forget that you are looking at a game.  Project CARS does what it set out to do really well.  I just can't help but compare it to SlightlyMad's previous outing in NFS Shift 2.  I liked the career element in NFS where there was more incentive to winning than just the glory.  Also the ability to make the cars your own I think is something that could have made the game feel like you are not so much going through the motions.  I can understand why the devs went this way but it is a nagging little detail that plays in back of my mind.Overall, CARS is a great game.  It is the closest thing to Gran Turismo that us PC gamers have.  It is visually stunning and the gameplay is rewarding.  It will continue to get better as the devs have put already a lot of time into it and will continue to do so for a while.  Oh, and I suggest that dropping yourself into a multiplayer lobby and hoping for the best is probably a bad idea.  Build some hours up on track as this game will really test your ability.			"

												Very realistic and fun for a few hours, but it does becomea bit tedious and repetitve at times. its fun when u get a rare but good matchup in online play, But for the most part u spend hours waiting in ""qualifying"" for other players to join. and when or if someone does they quit out if your settings arent perfect to their likings(like easy- ABS on TCS on ect) so the realism of crashing and recieving damage isnt usually accepted by most. so in a nutshell even though this game has major potential, it lacks that uumph to keep u playing hours on end. and maintaining interest. but overall it is a very satisfying feeling to go from 0-150 in an F1 car while monitoring ur gas tank and gear shifts and throttle control.  I love this game, but can ony handle about 3 hrs. before i feel like moving on.And in a game as realistic as this one, that should not be the case. My rating?  7 out of 10			"

												I have been playing games such as Forza both Motorsport and Horizon, Need For Speed, Grand Torismo, Test Drive and the long list goes on. I can happily say that this game feels different from them. While the current racing game market keeps shifting more and more towards the arcade style, Project CARS has delivered a true racing sim. It may have its issues and in my own opinion the physics while in karts is a bit screwy, but overall the game looks, feels, and sounds amazing. The in depth career mode is a great way to actually feel as though there is a point to continue racing by giving you that ability to move up by your own success. Unlike other games were you work though an event list or play a ""career"" were all you do is select a race and a car without any real reason, following a calendar and gaining invitationals again by succeeding in your current league keeps you engaged and gives you that want to just keep on going!

Awesome list of tracks and race types, terrific variety of cars (though focused more so on the race and European side of things), huge amount of setup adjustments: everything you want from a racing sim. Career mode is fun and thorough too.AI is good for the most part, its nice to have AI in a racing game that is reactive to you and your positioning/speed etc.My main gripes are with the GUI and beginning career multi-stage events.

												Project Cars is not for everyone. Capable of stunning graphics with the right GPU, it is (and was) very tempting. But the game is loaded with problems. Accuracy of vehicle dynamics and Force Feedback settings has been a major issue, and constantly written about. There are mods for this problem, but I found them of little real use. Personal research and experimentation garnered the best results. Literally, hours of work were put into it. Once the FFB hurdle is cleared, the problem with track accuracy becomes glaring. On several tracks the racing line is off from one track's layout to another (e.g. Snetterton 200 vs. Snetterton 300, especially Turn 4). This makes consistency an even bigger challenge than it already is. One problem with the A.I. that has popped up in a few forums is that A.I. opponents will turn out impossible lap-times over 75% difficulty. Personally, I ran the game all the way to 98% and did not struggle too much. Maybe this is just another manifestation of the Track and Vehicle inaccuracies. Additionally, fine-tuning your preferred graphics performance takes forever, because changing even one setting (e.g. grass detail) demands the game be re-booted before they take effect...and there are 20 settings!ADVICE BEFORE YOU BUY:1. Define what realism means to you. Graphics or accurate dynamics?2. Make sure you LOVE to tinker with Force Feedback and/or mods.3. Perform a self-diagnosis of your patience level.4. Invest in a beefy GPU, a punching bag and a stress ball :)			"

												A Review from a player with a G27.So I saw a lot of coverage of this game on gaming sites for a while now, but really wasn't that interested. I am more of an Assetto Corsa player and love that intense realism. I bought this game on a whim really not knowing what to expect, I was just hoping it wasn't going to be like Grid or Dirt, arcade stuff. All I wanted was something mostly realistic with good AI and a fun campaign, as that is lacking in Assetto.The driving is smooth, and pretty comparable to Assetto but a lot easier to get the hang of. The cars don't feel as weighty, but the driving with the settings on Pro is similar enough. This game has nice features like overheating brakes, mechanical failure, pit strategy, damage. All of these feature seem to work and work well. I have driven several  40+ lap races and having little things like a wheel nut lost in pit or random suspension failure are exciting and fun (don't worry it's not often).The AI is intense but good. They are a little stiff but I don't really know how they could be much better. They are fun to race. The one thing that’s troublesome is that when you race the AI you pick the difficulty before the race, which is good. I normally have them at about 80% strength and it’s a tough but good race. I win some, others I am in the pack somewhere. Still sometimes the strength is just horrible on certain maps. 80% will become more like 200% and they will drive the map like the rules of physics don't apply to them. I wish there were a standard for the percents. I don't expect to drive every map well and I don't expect to have to turn the AI down to 30% on one race in a series because they are dirty cheaters.The campaign isn't all that great you don't really get to feel like a race car driver and talk with your engineer, team or anyone. It's good enough though and it's fun to have the events focused and to be the champ in all the classes.One of the things I complained about in my initial review was that the physics from the carts where a bit ridicules. They seemed to fix all the wonky physics. Still on the technical side the game can be a bit…. troublesome. I can't host multiplayer games because sometimes the G27 just won't even work once the map loads in. I had a problem with the grass textures filling my screen nearly every other time I loaded a map. The grass thing was an easy fix, but the wheel problem is one that started with the last patch.Multiplayer is GREAT. It's easy to get in a game or to host one. All the other random players I have played with have been really good people and I have super slow internet (1.5 mbps) and have had no issues with latency.I have to say I'm finding the game really worth the money and it fits into a fun place that is separate from Assetto and other racing simulators I have played. It’s a great game and I really enjoy it. I have suggested tow others to buy it as well and they both love it.			"
