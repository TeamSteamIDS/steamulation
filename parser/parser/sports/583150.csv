												This is a super early review but I know how much that can matter in the success or failure of games on Steam, VR games especially and it'd be a shame to see this game go no-where due to lack of reviewers.  In short if you're after Mario Kart on Vive then for the price I'm certainly not arguing, nausea might hit you a bit hard to start with but if you can handle Cars and other more 'intense' experiances then it shouldn't be a problem.  Not seen a huge amount of the content yet but what I have looks nice and well made.  It's cheap and it's karting in vr, on that basis I'd say it's on to a winner.  Will update in case my experiance changes dramatically from more play time.			"

												This is the single best game I've played in vr so far, and I've played the brookhaven experiment, arizona sunshine, and several other vr titles that don't even come close, this game is very very similer to mario kart and I consider that a bonus considering that there is no way nintendo would ever make mario kart in vr. This game is easily worth twice the price, and I got it on sale for 6$, practically a steal. There are some issues worth mentioning:1. I can't change my character to a boy, not sure if thats just me being a moron or if thats actually not an in game option2. Since it is a karting game, I think having more gameplay modes or an online mode would add a lot to the gameplay3. Since the game does not have a roster of characters like mario kart, a system where you can upgrade the cars and personalize them would add a lot more to the overall personal feel to the gameOther than this, I absolutely love this game, I'd give it an 8.7/10			"

												Very fun game, very similar to Mario Kart. For this price, this game is excellent!. Having the ability to unlock cars and tracks makes you want to keep playing. My only request would be to add a multiplayer mode at some point.			"

												I liked this game, but I can't recomend it in it's current state. This really feels like it should have been early access as there is potential here and a good base for a great game, that I would have easily paid twice as much for. But far too much right now feels left out and unpolished to recomend this as a complete game.The GoodDriving feels solid, with cars having a nice solid yet zippy feel to them. You have the option of side bashing other cars at any time, and it never gets old side checking a car trying to pass you. The choice to do the vr with an overhead view instead of a cockpit view I can say was a wise decision. Tracks all feel a bit different and most of them were a joy to go through with some of the later ones providing a nice challenge. I never ran into any issues with performance although I'd be kinda worried if I had given my specs.The BadItem mode is a total wreck, with powerups feeling indistinct, hard to wield, and unbalanced. Half of the powerups basically amount to a forward facing ability that that auto homes in on racers in some way stuns or slows your oponent, and have no way of being guarded against aside from a shield that lasts a few seconds and shatters immediatly upon first provocation. Certain weapons like the upgraded turtle shot have no issues backfiring and taking you out along side your opponent, and aside from manually turning your head around, you have to blindly fire road hazards.   Expect to lose a number of races from getting surprised shot with 5 attacks at the last seond.Progress effectivly amounts to grinding rather than actually getting better with track unlocks and basic car unlocks tied to a license and money system  that can easily be broken by just spamming a stage in time mode, which unlike item mode you will always win by a mile as long as you drive decently.  While most other car unlocks are tied to repeatedly using weapons you mainly get when doing less than good. Half the cars amount to little more than recolors with changed stats, and there's no changing or customising your car or driver outside of a car selection.Certain tracks also have issues containing jumps without turbo pads, that I (And an AI driver) found ourselves in a position of being stuck in a loop of not having enough speed after getting attacked to make a jump only to be respawned right before the jump with no way of building speed before the jump.And while it's not a huge deal to me, this is a kart racer with no multiplayer, and while the vr looks good, it doesn't add anything to the game, unlike say VR Kart with it's look to aim system. The choice to make this a vr only seems to be crippling it's outreach potential which if it does get multiplayer, may become a big deal.Recomendations:-More fire and forget weapons that require precise aiming-More ways to defend against attacks (Many kart racers for example lets you use projectiles and hazards defensivly) -Easier way to look backwards-Tie more of the upgrades to a cup mode or something similar rather than a simple grind to win scenario.-More than two modes in general, Perhaps a true time trial that doesn't have you racing opponenets?-Online Multiplayer would be nice.-This game doesn't really need vr like most vr titles, it might make sense to have a non-vr version "

												I don't suffer from motion sickness in games where I get to stand up and move around. But when I am forced to sit down and cannot properly respond to movement around me, then it can happen that I start feeling bad. Racing games are a typical case in point, and often I cannot drive more than a few laps around a race course before I need to take a break.But this racer doesn't make me feel sick at all - very nicely done!! And, yes: This really is Mario Kart in VR!! Hoping for multiplayer!!			"

												OUTLAW here, Im first place in most of the time trial races.  This game is pretty fun.  Reminds me of Mario Kart a lot.  I can't wait till we can compete with other players online.   Worth the price, spent a lot of hours playing this.			"

												Keyboard controls and third-person view... Not particularly Vive immersive. Might as well play on a monitor. Vive controllers ""showed up"" but they were useless and didn't even track location. At one point there were laser pointers coming from them, but even those didn't line up.			"
