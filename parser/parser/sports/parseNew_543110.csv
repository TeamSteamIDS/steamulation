												This is the real thing for all soccer fans out there. Passes from different positions, true goals and really good ball physics. A little bit addictive trying to always improve my highscore. I love it.			"

												Best heading simulator in 2016. Heading the ball was realistic, goalie difficulty was good. Gameplay is simple. Good for parties or a couple minutes of play. There is a Global leaderboard. There aren't any different game modes just changes in difficulty. Sounds and art are very repitive. A little variety in the visual effects would go a long way. Instead for some reason there is a day to night transition that happens very fast, this effects lighting condistions. The star speed is almost enought to cause motion sickness. Overpriced but the physics are good so I'm keeping it :-)			"
