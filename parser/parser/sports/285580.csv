Early Access Review
								Played the game a lot. Consider myself a veteran. Delayed my review in order to see if the early access isn´t going to be abused. Been active in game and out of the game, spent hours on testing bugs, finding out cheats and many more.Throughout the whole year we got one new runner (champion/god/character for the MOBA player), there are now nine of them. They gave some of the runner new cosmetics, which are except two of them only recolours. Every time someone pins them down in the discussions, they reply with ""early access"". The excuse has been used so much that either the little nice community doesn´t realize that the game didn´t go anywhere the last year or they are just plain up ignorant.Point is there have been patches, some of them did contain stuff u could argue got the game somewhere, there even have been balance patches after the game got played by the same 3 runners every game. There also has been a tournament with prize money. A buggy, abusable game like this shouldn´t have a prize tournament, but that´s up to the devs. The community consists of nice people, in my opinion those ♥♥♥♥er did more to keep the game alive than everyone else.To sum it up here is my list:Pros:- Nice community- Has huge potential- First sport game that tries to get into e-sports- Made a balance patch after the community has been whiny enoughCons:- No progress- Last patches made the game even worse- Unbalanced- Can´t even correct simple pictures or runner info after a year- Abusing early access- Chaotic game management and development (wonder if SHG knows of half their links they posted (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11EbUQ8Xvm-oodM3Reb4lKmoLf9kelmddQUHinx3GDnI/edit#gid=1801396602))- Told us the release date would be early 2k16 with more runner and a better performance overallI have been waiting long enough to post a review, months ago it might have been a positive one, but right now, the game is not worth even downloading. Since I am testing it every once in a while I am going to update the review if there is something positive to talk about.Edit: Tested it a couple of days ago, no changes, game seems to be abandoned, last saved video of their streaming channel has been 5 months ago. Seems since JTs contract run out, the game pretty much lost it´s last breath.			"

												Although it has a small community as I make this post, this game is simply amazing. The concept of a third person futuristic hockey/soccer game not only sounds radical but IS radical. I hope the community for this game expands, as I know it will, because this game honestly deserves it. Behind every great game is a great team of developers, and that is true with Project Cyber and Spearhead Games.11/10. Would play all day.			"

								So after a good 5-6 months I decided it's time for a legit review. Arena: Cyber Evolution HAD a lot of potential, it really did. BUT after those 6 months of playing I realized there was barely any progression happening with this game. The charts are just terrible. The peak of players online is 267. And that was probably back when the game was released. Well, I loved the small community here but this game is simply going no where. Developers don't listen to the community too much. They add cosmetic items when there are SO many bugs, like not being able to play with a wireless card, or everyone lagging because there is 50+ players on. The only person I see helping this community is Jethro Tull, and he's not even a developer. I REALLY loved this game, I really did but it's time to move on. And I hope all of you do because at this point, Spearhead Games is just wasting their money. Now, if any improvements happen, I'll change my mind but until further notice. Goodbye ACE.			"

												The game has a lot of potential to turn into something great on the indie scene, the devs are taking ideas submitted by us the players and taking them onboard which is great, right now the game is very bare bones as you'd expect with an under development title in its early stages, it still needs some core basic features to get it going like sound and a way to communicate with team mates along with some A.I partners for when your unable to get into a match with players but the focus right now seems to be on stability of connecting to match servers so people can test the game which i would agree should be the primary focus to start off then add things like sound assets in to make it a more enjoyable experience.I never had issues with frame drops or connecting during my 2 matches but i did see a few people chopping about the screen so i guess some peoples rigs are finding it hard to cope. I'll be following the development of the game to see how it progresses and will edit this accordingly to reflect the changes made!			"

			Arena Cyber Evolution Review / First Impressions about the new MOSA (Multi Online Sports Action) also the game is known as ACE and you can play the game here -...		

Cool ConceptArena Cyber evolution is somewhat interesting game as a concept, but i feel a bit that the game lacks certain depth in order to be a bigger title than it currently is. Sure its still early access game and its not finished. I Like the mechanics of the game since its easy to get into and there is not that much difference between the characters except their abilities and overall stats.After all its a Free To Play title i think for that it aint half bad, but ive witnessed some issues with connection, but that seems to be bit better than it used to.

Early Access Review
								I like Arena Cyber Evolution a lot, I think its one of the best ""sports"" games out there, even at the stage its at now. I dont think I have ever seen a better candidate for an e-sport. and while Arena cyber Evolutions sure does not pull it off now, I bet that it would if the devs got the funding to do so. It may look it but Arena Cyber Evolution is NOT a MOBA, it does not play like a MOBA and nce you get in game you will see it doesn't even look much like a MOBA either. My only issues with the game so far are that there are not many characters and the characters they have are a bit grindy to unlock. there are no servers for the game its mostly peer to peer, so rage quits are a problem at this point in time. There is also only one arena or map currently to play on. It is lucky then all these Negative aspects described above are addressed in the stretch goals, with certain amounts of funding they will be adding more content and things like servers, and voice acting. The developers also have stated that they will be adding new characters every few weeks after launch, I dont know how this will turn out yet, but I am hopeful.I think this 3v3 Sporty action game is most definitely worth your time, and I recommend you play it if you are a fan of any genre, its got that wide of a net. The game play is addictive as well so you might just feel hooked! There are not a lot of layers in game yet, so if you like Arena Cyber Evolution be sure to spread the word. This game is a game I want to see successful.			"

								1st impression of ACE.Not the prettiest game in the world...But and its a big BUT this game has a lot of scope to be a clasic.  Sure player numbers are low right now but thats not the games fault thats just marketing.I spent ten solid hours in one sitting playing this and although few in number the guys who have played this for a while seem very nice.  No noob abuse and when I pointed out that they were hard to match due to their upgrades every one of them dumpped their upgrades and went vanilla for me, can a noob ask for more.I would suggest downloading this and spending a few hours playing.  Would i spend money on it in store? I dont know yet as I have a rule about spending on F2P games. If you can get everything via ingame cash that you can with $ and $ gives no advantage then ill pay but i have not played enough to assess this as of yet.Overall first 10 hours I'd give 8/10. Lost marks explained below.-1 :No in match chat or voip so for new guys or ppl with no 3rd party voip coodination may be an issue.-1: Matchmaking at this time can put noobs in with tooled up vets making for some very unbalance play if the vets dont realise you are new or just dont care and keep their boosts active. ( this may be due to player numbers however so take this one with a pinch of salt) "

								Three-on-three ice hockey with a roster of robot players who are like MOBA heroes: Each with different strengths, weaknesses, and special moves. Like a MOBA, you acquire new heroes (called ""runners"" in this game) with real money, or in-game currency you have to farm. Everyone starts with two runners: A forward (the player that tries to score goals) and a keeper (the player that tries to prevent the other team from scoring goals).Matches are only three minutes long and the matchmaker puts you in with bots if it can't find other players (which is often). Figuring out how to pass and remembering to keep your opponents covered is actually harder than figuring out the controls. After the unavoidable first impression that the game would be easier with a dual-analog controller, you'll quickly become an ace with the mouse-and-keyboard setup.Beautiful graphics, cool heroes, catchy music, easy to learn. All it really needs is a bigger player base.			"

								Before I downloaded this I was a bit skeptical, as I've not seen a game quite like this. Before I continue, I  do not like playing/watching sports, I do not play any other sports games. You can fall in love with this game without having to like sports, and get the team-work feelingof sports. If you and your team are working together above all else, you can be unstoppable.This game is amazing, and the dev team is awesome ^.^ pretty easy to contact them if you ever need to.The only downside to this game is that not enough people try/play this game! Everyone that does play it loves itSo, grab 2 of your friends, download this awesome free-to-play game, and go dominate the Arena, tell all your friendshave 3v3's with your friends, randoms, or bots. Grow with the community and help shape the game.Now finally, this game has a competitive side, and this is what really strikes me. Every sunday they have a tournamentwhere they shoutcast matches and pit the dominating against eachother, you don't have to be a certain level to enter, you don't even have to be good but these tournaments are an amazing experience to be able to enter with your friends.I recommend this game to all gamers.Oh and hey, you grab this game and realize your a natural and just wreck everything, give me a message and maybe you can join my competitive team ;P			"

								+very fun+quick 5-10 minute games, perfect for a quick match before going to class+not terribly difficult at first, but player skill is very relevant+unique characters(which they will hopefully, most likely add more of) each with their own powers to help them in their main role+characters tailored to specific roles (goalie, interceptor, etc) but you can still play whatever character in whatever position+team work is very important, because you cannot  hold the puck for an unlimited amount of time, this requires you to pass to a team mate+the graphics are very good, reminds me of borderlands with the cartoonish style+bots are similar in skill to other players, behave like players would+free to play+NOT pay to win, you can buy hats and cosmetic with the spearhead points(points you buy with real money) but they also sometimes drop in chests you get when leveling up (i got a dark employanator skin for my negociator this way) other charactes can be bought with money bought or earned in game, and upgrades can only be bought using the earned in game currency+active devs working hard to improve the game as well as add new content-very small community, most of the time when I log on, there are less than 10 people online in my region, and the most i've ever seen online would be maybe 40-50consensus: download this game, it's free, it's fun, and the community needs to grow and the devs could use your support			"

								This is a very simple, fun and challenging game that you play 3v3.  It's reminds me more of ice hockey than it does soccer, but either way, it's a blast with the different combinations of toons you can choose from, all with differnent roles and abilities.  I applaud it for the easy key management (wasd + space + mouse).  Only two special abilities per toon, so it's not DOTA on ice and it allows the gamer to focus on teamplay.  Also, the matches only last 5 minutes apiece, so you're not bogged down in a long game. I really hope this one catches one.  Also, as a free-play game, it doesn't try r@ping your wallet for upgrades.  Easily obtained through playing, especially if you play as a team.  Great job devs!  Good luck to you!!			"

								This is one of the few games in the steam free to play section that are definately worth your time and support. Some may be turned off by the aspect of early access but spearhead games has the best communication I've currently seen with an early access title. With developer streams happening every weekday and them essential using those streams as a Q&A session, it gives the community a very effective way to view the upcoming developments of this game. For example on August 18th this game was released on steam free to play, and by August 21st the development team had patched the game to include some features that the community requested via the stream. Aka bots when a person leaves a match etc...This games has incredible potential as an esport once dedicated servers are put in place and I highly suspect this to become one of the main esport games of the future with the right support. Which is important since the esport field is heavily saturated with MOBA titles with little else combatting it's popularity. I hope this game continues to go down the road it's taking, as it is a beautiful one.			"

												This reminds me of Worms when it was first released back in '95, because at first Project Cyber looks very simple and not visually impressive. But Spearhead Studios has captured something here which is very, very rare - pure and simple FUN! Without any fancy visuals or complicated controls they've somehow got the core of game that has that 'just-one-more-game' factor and is very enjoyable to play. Given time to polish the visuals, give the game some more personality and refine the core mechanics a little more and this game could easily enter into video game nostalgia for tens of thousands of players. It is great to finally see a developer make an effort to create a non-violent game that is still competative!Give it a chance when you have 10-15 mins with nothing to do, you will not regret it.

Early Access Review
								This game has been by far the best free to play game that I have played on steam and it is currently one of the few that I am actually continuing to play because of the community and the continual support of the developers.  This is a long review with a general pros and cons list at the bottom, if you wanna hear me ramble feel free to read but check out the botttom if youre scrolling through and want a quick synopsis.About myself: College athlete with a huge interest in sports and gaming is one of my favorite hobbies.  I enjoy MOBAs such as LOL, DOTA2, and Smite and play them frequently while also enjoying shooters and strategy games.  Honestly sports games havent held much time with me simply because they are $60 new each year and the community disappears immediately for the new version and while fun it gets expensive.  I downloaded this as my weekly free to play game (Cause I want to try new games and see what catches my eye) and got stuck playing all night.  I wanted to beat the bots and after a while I did, I ran into some humans too on occasion and that was even better.  I got my brother and a friend to get the game and now we are competing in the first esports season for this game on Team Shadow Fox (hence the [SFX] tag)  If you see this review, feel free to add me as a friend and I will have no trouble playing with you if you need a teammate or just have a question about the game.About the Game:  Currently it is 3v3 airhockey/icehockey fused with the idea of a MOBA.  You are able to select from a small pool of champions/characters/runners which are given a  couple of abilities to work as a team and outscore your opponents.  Game time is a short 5 minutes so you arent deeply committed to anything and the que times are only 1min long maximum.  There is no pay to win element of this game as the ""real money"" currency is meant for asthetic skins or hats or unlocking a runner early.  There is a regular in game currency used for picking from ""implants"" that can help customize your champion from improving his speed, defense, offense, or supporting your teammates.  The in game currency with enough grinding will also certainly unlock champions you are hoping to play.  There is also a free champion rotation to help players try them out and buff their champion pool.Roles Currently are simple and the champion pool currently has 8 runners in it with more on the way.  Strikers are designed to be fast and add power to their shots.  Supports are designed for passing options as well as to buff their team or debuff their opponents such as speed ups, slocks, dislodging the puck.  And of course the goalie who has abilities to help keep the puck out of your own net.  Hopefully as new champions come out the strategies and playstyles will be as complex and diverse as one could hope for.The Community: By far the reason I enjoy this game so much right now.  First off, how frequently are you going to be able to speak to the game developers of some of the bigger companies like Riot or Blizzard and actually get a solid response?  The developers will talk to you, get your opinions, tell you about upcoming game builds or runners, even friend you on steam.  One even helped troubleshoot a graphical error I was encountering in one of the early patches this year.  They are hard working and are continually working to improve the game and its player base all while having fun too.  I know the game is still young, but I know these guys wont abandon it and leave it in the purgatory that is early acess alpha games.They hold very frequent events and tournaments which is great for meeting other players, testing your skill and watching some of the best teams go head to head.  It adds the fun competitive edge without going over the top.  There are weekly mini tournaments with which to compete in that are low stress and fun while on the weekends there are solo player and team based tournaments which are designed for the serious competitors and the best players will compete in these.  Oddly enough this is how I got roped into the game when I followed the twitch stream and some of the best players in the game (Hypnos and Pit) brought in a guy with less than 10hrs play time into what felt like a pro event.  It was a lot of fun and nobody was too upset or frustrated with how lousy I was and we still came out ok.  On top of that Spearhead games has a dedicated sports caster Jethro Tull who will make you feel like your actually at the arena.  Finally all of the players who frequent the game all seem to be chill individuals who have no trouble helping out a new player, like new ideas, and are generally fun to play against.  They will tell you gg and actually mean it.My final Pros vs Cons listPros-Free to play and not pay to win-3v3 team competitive experience-Short time comittment ~5min-Well designed and balanced characters (Devs will make balance changes)-Solid repeat player base-Competitive tournaments and ranking system-Decent soundtrack (repetitive after a few games though)-Player base is friendly in game-Devs listen and care both in forum and in streamed events and personal message even-Devs will create runners based on fan suggestions (Obviously it needs to be feasible and balanced but it has happened)-Community appears to be growing if only slowly-Great game for groups of friends (Ideally 3 or 6)Cons/What needs to improve-Small player base (outside of events its tough finding a full match if you are solo, although this is improving)-It's alpha so still a glitch here and there, mostly graphical, nothing debilitating-Small Champion Pool (New game so its to be expected and it should grow)-Ranking system is not necessarily tied with matchmaking system (New patch just came out, but currently there is nothing thats going to stop you from being matched with the weekend warrior if you are new)-Ranking System is ELO which means its a solo player rating for a team based game (Currently this is the only feasible option, there arent enough players for a tiered system like LOL or Smite and this system will minimize the damage if you do get matched with a pro on your first day out)-AI is nothing special, they look for straight line passes and shots even if it across the middle of your own goal with the other team in the way.  If you have a full group there is no issue, but if not dont expect the bots to be carrying your butt to victory.Finally any issues you do have with the game, the devs want to hear about them.  Post in the forums, pitch ideas, visit the streams during tournaments.  They will answer you, other players will answer you.  Graphical glitch, they can help.  Need friends to play with, I added 4 friends this week cause I posted I wanted to develop my sunday teams roster.  The best thing you can do for yourself and this game is to download it, get two friends to download it, play together and compete.  You wont be disappointed and if you are say so and check it out the next patch.			"

								First off, forget all the hype and marketer-speak. Will Arena: Cyber Evolution be the next big e-sports craze? No, there's a 99% chance it won't. MOBA-like champion logic? What does that even mean?Cyber Evolution is simply a 3 on 3 ice hockey game in space. That's it, although there really isn't anything wrong with that. What is wrong is that the controls are ponderously slow and floaty, and the puck is lost all too easily in the flashy graphical effects of special moves and players clashing at the goal. As for the community, it's currently extremely small. Prepare to play with and against a lot of bots. Despite Cyber Evolution's problems, I would recommend giving it a try. There is some fun to be had with it, and if its wrinkles are ironed out, it could become significantly more interesting. As it is now I'd give it a solid B-.			"

								This game is better than a turtle eatin' turkey sh*t.  no foolin' either.+ games last 5-7 minutes+ stupid easy to learn+ stupid hard to master+ free to play+ can't pay to win+ vaguely resembles a sport but with players who make fun of your mother when screw up. actually wait thats just like a real sport- the main commentator on their channel at twitch.tv/spearheadgames isnt very good.  He keeps talking and wont shut the hell up. But at least they cast every day and have a bunch of tournaments all the time so theres that ;)- Sometimes I forget what my wife looks like but I keep playing anyway- after every game you look at the clock and think to yourself ""ok, ONE more game"" and then eventually you lose your job- turns out everyone was right about my mother9/10 - would download again			"

								Its very sad to see games like this die...This is hockey game which has around 10 different characters. Each character has 2 different skills, and some characters are more suited for goalkeeping while others are for scoring goals and buffing the team. Its 3v3 game where either one of the teams has to score most goals in order to winPros:- unique and gorgeous setting, it reminds me of Galactik Football cartoon so much- beautiful graphics- great sound effects- devs care about it and stream every week- you can get shop items by leveling up- if game doesnt find other players in time, you can play versus botsCons:- very small community- bots are very good at goalkeeping			"

								This game is really great. I don't know any other way to put it. You know you are having a great time when your heart is racing during the game, and afterwards you still can't stop shaking. For anyone downloading the game for the first time, let me start by saying that as of right now, going in at a random time and clicking play to find 5 other people is very rare. It may be discouraging and feel like a dead game, but it is very much the opposite. Instead of deleting the game or never playing it because you can't find full games, watch the streams, go to the forums, and get help from a community member. Tournaments are almost daily, and pick-up games are very often. Finding a team is usually not too hard, and you can make it easy by inviting some friends to come play.Essentially, the gameplay is just 3 on 3 hockey like matches, set in the future. There are a number of different runners designed to fill certain roles on a team, each with different speeds and abilities. Even though there is currently not a massive amount of runners, I am yet to get bored of the intense and exciting matches. There is no story/campaign mode, and the entire thing is a multiplayer game. If a player ques and finds no people or only a few (as happens often) then bots will fill in for the missing slots. Most players like to focus on a single runner to excel at, but once in the character selection nothing is holding you back from choosing any of the characters you have unlocked (all characters can be unlocked with in game currency, or real money, but please, do not get the impression that this is a pay to win game. Certain runners are stronger than others but every single one can be played well, and no runner is too far unbalanced.) The matches are a short 5 minutes long in an arena with each team trying to shoot the puck into the other teams goal.The community for this game is awesome. Its very friendly, and alot of the members have almost the entire community on their friends list at this point. The community isn't very large at all, and alot of the players in it have been playing since the start, but you get to know everybody this way, making it really great despite the sizeHonestly, this game has so many flaws currently, despite so many already being fixed. Lack of players, bad bot AI, bugs, balancing issues, and various other things all pull this game back. But i think it says something that even amidst all these problems that on other games would be enough to make me quit, this game has kept me coming back for more.Seriously, check out this game, and remember, don't feel discouraged when at first you can't find anyone.

								It's like a chopped-down NHL game with comic-book cyber-fi competitors.  And it's awesome.The game's simply a blast.  Rather, it's fun in its own simplicity.  You control one of three team mates (decently effective bots or players take the other slots), and a disc-puck-thing is dropped between you and the opposing team (where it is placed, precisely, is determined by last goal scored).  The teams rush for it, and use their unique players' abilities to snatch, slow, and stop the puck-handler.  Goals can be made by either dunking/running for a touchdown (run the puck into the net), or by shooting it in.  The grab-release mechanic allows for quick execution of shots, and easy interceptions.This is still a very young game, so as long as the core components aren't messed with and there is some major (and I mean major, as far as the magically-laggy home screen is concerned) MAJOR performance issues addressed.  Personally I feel this game should run just fine for everyone, but for some reason it hates my (more than adequate) graphics card, and pretty much any time I'm not actually in a game (where there are zero server side or client side latency issues), the graphics seem to progressively drop the framerate.  It almost feels like their fog effects don't ever fully dissipate and just stack invisible particles, or something.tl;dr Try it!  It's free, and it's fun!			"

								I dont review games too often, espcially early access but I felt that I had to say something about this one. Although it's still got a bit to go before it can be considered complete (very few champions to play as right now) but if you are looking for a MOBA that is very unique, pretty much in it's own genre then try this one. The community is growing but super helpful and there are tournaments going on a lot.What sets this one apart is the gameplay, it is sports themed with scoring points in mind and with that comes some very exhilirating gameplay much like you would see from watching an actual sports game. This game is definitely worth a try.			"

								Having only played a little of the game so far i can already say its worth trying out, it brings a fresh new gameplay style in a sea of mediocre titles that just rip off eachothers features. Some Pros and Cons i've noticed so far:PROS:- Fluid and familiar control scheme, easy to learn, hard to master- Short but quick and exciting matches that never have a dull moment- Shows good potential character customisation- Different characters each with their own strengths and weaknesses- Unique abilities for each character- Enviromental effects that switch up how you play on the flyCONS:- Bot AI that fills any empty player slots its extremely naive, often doing nothing or scoring own goals- Personally would prefer a 4v4 game mode along with 3v3- Community needs to grow to avoid the awful Bot players Hopefully this game gains a good following, it deserves it already.

								Great promise.Currently, the game is a bit lacking in features, and is still clearly fresh into the development, only really getting the aesthetics and mechanics of the game. Things are still missingly, like character balance and that creepy thing I assume is going to be an announcer still currently lacks a voice, so he just stares at you.The game has a fair few bugs, yet I can see the developers are just trying to make the game that -they- want to. Lots of heart is being put into this, and the actual gameplay is buckets of fun. A few games in and I was already getting stories I was willing to tell my friends with near misses and amazing goals.The biggest thing that picks my mind, however, is the lack of players combined with the bot AI. I am yet to find a full match, and most of the time I'm lucky to even get a 1v1, and not just me versus a lot of bots for the same XP. And the bot AI is fairly against the game, they seem to be the perfect player, and the difficulty seems only limited by how accurate the shot is going to be. They constantly are better then players at keeping the enemy from having the puck, and they have perfect teamwork, most of the time.However, even with these little nitpicks, I still find the game enjoyable, thusly, I recommend it.

								Spectacularly fun 3v3 game - I've been following the development stream/playing since Pax East and it's definitely one of the most enjoyable games I've played. Even just in this early build it feels very tight. The skill ceiling is gonna be very high, with a lot of room for creative uses of the powers + different class synergies.Very much a case of easy to pick up, hard to master, but anyone can be playing competently within a round or two.Also, the devs are pretty much the best people. Play this! Love it! Brace for giant changes because it's changing literally every day!+100 points because the devs are actively working on this all the time, it won't be one of those ""early access"" games that just stays half-baked forever.

								*Quick note - I see a lot of reviews on here with like 0.3 hours played or less. My teammate clocked in 146 hours and I'm over 50 so perhaps ignore the positive reviews that show the person installed it and ran the title screen over people like me that actually put some time in. Sadly the fact this game is even still listed on Steam reenforces the feeling that over the last 2 years Steam has gone from a solid platform for good games into an unchecked and uncontrolled shovelware factory for novice made indie garbage.Funny a friend introduced me to this game maybe two years back because he was friends with one of the devs. Comically over time said unnamed dev grew tired of some of the BS going on with the leads decision making which becomes a large part of this review.When I first played the game it was actually fun. There was a lot of potential despite being extremely rough. I was part of one of the first teams to play the game for cash as competitive eSports players, something I hadn't done in a long time. However despite the potential the net code alone made even simple practice with teammates brutal if not impossible.We gave feed back, the team ignored it. Each release the game got worse and worse with a clear focus on skins, visuals and other garbage they planned to monetize rather than making the game work. Believe it or not the net code got worse as it became clear the team really had no idea what they were doing when it came to networking. So rather than fix the match making and network issues they changed the menus, added new sounds and other pointless crap that didn't matter because you rarely could join a game and when you did you'd probably get disconnected at some point anyhow.There were so many problems and I wrote about them on my teams website and various other places for the devs to review but jump ahead it looks like they gave up much like the majority of the player base who they alienated during feed back sessions and the tournaments they put on.All in all it's quite sad to have seen the potential and then to watch them flush it. More so it's incomprehensible they would charge you $208.96 even if the game was complete and rock solid. That's like three or four triple A games or a crappy beater car for an unfinished no name game!			"

								I was really happy with my first experience in the game! While the controls took a little getting used to (I was complete trash), and the bot AI was sometimes even worse than I was, I managed to really enjoy the game so far! Pity there aren't many players online playing with me, so I couldn't do much else but play with bots (One bot kept hogging the ball, then trying to score when it obviously had no skill there).In the future, I'd definitely like to see more characters, maybe even a bigger team once the number of characters has grown. 3v3 is a really small amount (although sensible now in it's state of dormance)...I really enjoyed it, and only wish it was faster to unlock heroes! :3			"

								Don't let the apparent simplicity of this game fool you.  It's actually pretty deep tactically, especially when you are playing with and against other experienced players.  Unlike LoL, DOTA, etc. A:CE features relatively short matches which means you can fit a pubby session into a pretty tight window -- which is great if you're busy.  The control scheme is pretty tight: WASD + mouse is a lot more fun and intuitive than the usual MOBA clickfest.It can only continue to get better as the devs implement new features, more runners (champions) and more players get involved.  Definitely worth checking out and getting on board.  Great community and really moving in the right direction.  FTP so there's no reason not to fire up some matches and start pwning! "

								Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Even though this game is still in very early alpha and definitely has its fair share of bugs (to be expected), Arena: Cyber evolution is not only very playable, but highly addicting and a friggin blast to play. The gameplay is as intuitive as its controls. After just completing the tutorial, I immediately fell in love with this game's simple yet brilliant design. The only downside to the game is that it is very difficult to get matched up with other players as it seems that in its early stages, there are not many players online with a possible exception of primetime.A round currently plays out like a game of soccer or hockey, with three players to a team. The soccer ball or puck is replaced by a disc. There are also already a decent handful of characters to choose from, all with very unique special abilities. The fact that this game is so easy to learn, yet presents quite the challenge when matched with well-practiced players on the opposing team makes close matches as tense as your favorite physical sport. I think this game will be one of the top eSport games out there. I hope to see it go far.This game is a blast already. AND ITS FREE!!! GET ITTT!!!! NOW!!!!!			"

July 25, 2015I guess I'm not the only one to have forgotten about this game. ACE really hasn't changed much since last year. The menus changed (for worse), there are some new characters and storyline stuff, and the tutorial is even less helpful, but the core game is unchanged. Network problems are undetectable, mostly because you will be placed in all bot matches within 60 seconds, and there is no one playing anymore. There's a bunch of skins and tournament stuff, but the game is pretty lifeless now.Yes, the game is free, give it a shot if you are interested. Maybe you'll be one of the people that jumps in and gets hooked. I really don't expect most people to be like that. I found more players months ago, and I think server region splits really hurt. Even if you can find players, I don't feel the gameplay is satisfying enough. The arena feels huge and everything feels sluggish for a 5 minute match. Abilities will only be used a few times in a match, and it just doesn't feel fun. Those abilities are also still hard to land or identify, with particle overload making the game hard to understand as a viewer.The developers work on growing a community, but I don't feel Early Access is being used to make the game more appealing. The old list of stretch goals has disappeared, and little issues remain. Updates have mostly been fixes and Ranked stuff, it seems like gameplay is not going to change. The tutorial uses a lot more words to teach less (it doesn't even teach passing now), and the menus are still unintuitive. Currency and progression systems are not explained clearly, and I still feel the power progression system is a mistake for a competitive game. There are only 2 supported resolution options listed, and graphics options are barren. Oh but they give away game currency and items, so usability issues disappear because free stuff. The Trello board is empty, the forums are full of ""we appreciate the feedback, updates are coming"", and the match lobby still doesn't have team-only chat. The game won't be marketed until it is finished, and I expect there will be another overhaul to the menu and graphics, but the core issues won't change. It's not an engaging game for most players. With goalies, the game is a sluggish 2v2 centered around blocking everything. The VERY early alpha feeling still shows up, with even the tutorial throwing up error codes. It was interesting to see the process of development, but I can't see myself putting even dozens of hours into this game, or recommending it to friends. Almost a year ago I felt the game wasn't ready, and hoped it would be stronger in 6 months. Dozens of small tournaments later, the game is still rightfully Early Access.			"

								A very nice game.Very ituitive controls that can be picked up in just a few minutes, innovative gameplay, and short action packed games.It still needs some polishing through bugfixes, a few more eligible characters and maybe some balancing, but that is to be expected from an early access game, and the developers make a huge effort to include the community in the game developement process, which makes me feel like this game could be the next big player on the e-sports playground, if it gets some more players. The playerbase is still quite slim, which causes many matches to include bots, but since every one is new to the game, the bots still offer some competition, if they are not playing as goalkeeper.Overall I highly recommend this game, and I think every gamer with some affinity to e-sports should definatively give it a try.

The artstyle, gameplay, the ""runners"" or characters, and just the idea of this type of game in general. I can tell this is going to be a very competetive game and its going to have a lot of strategy involved. I like to think of a mix of air hockey and some sort of mix between like, Borderlands from the artstyle and say, a MOBA game from the camera angles and gameplay.

												Great game I got to try at Pax East 2014. (hence the low play time on my account) Really addicting and the matches are short enough so also great for a competitive gamer that might not have the time for a 40 min Dota 2 match or game of similiar nature.Think hockey/soccer with 3 players on a team and the current characters fill the role of striker, midfield, goalie. Success has been found staying true to your positions but also getting a big aggressive and creative. For a game only 3 months old it is in great shape and the developers are very open with the public.			"

								 A very good game. Picture air hockey, but with little men all over the table using joint force to manuever the puck into the goal, all the while facing the opposing team's units and trying to outrun/outsmart them. Each of these men also have different, unique abilities, requiring each team member to play their role. That's Project Cyber (except... it ain't - more like soccer [football for the rest of the world]).   "

								Pros: Potential to be insanely fun, Competive, Dont have to have a credit card to get better equipment, Ranked and non ranked with multiple teirs, different play styles Forward tattical and deffense, skills to make things more interestingCons: No one to play with (spent hours in que looking for a match), Cash shop (to be expected with a f2p game), a little buggy as its early access, little instruction in the beggining, no available single player to practice against bots.Overall once things get worked out and settled in and players start to play the game this is goign to be a fun humen version of rocket league. Would love to see a practice mode implemented and bots to play against for those who dont enjoy pvp. Once this game has gained a community and a player base it should be hours of fun.			"

								Really cool and well designed concept.  This game truly breaks away from the traditional MOBA format and offer a truly unique experience rather than Dota clone #129Not that other Mobas arent cool, i play a lot of them, but this offer something unique.  Think Cyberpunk Hockey with cool and unique skills.  If anybody ever read Gunnm : Battle Angel Alita, the setting reminds me a lot about that.This game is all about skill and it's a rather hard game to play.  I havent played enough to be comfortable in front of other players so there is definitely a skill curve here.  Also, its truly F2P in the way it should be done and that is a staple of any Moba, or should i say in this case, MosaI recommend			"

								If a developer wants my respect, they have to prove they know how to prioritize content. Why we're seeing new skins when the game is so unfinished I have no idea. The fact that they need (or want) money from in-game transactions so soon in developement just proves that they don't have the genre's best interest in mind.So far this is my experience in ACE: The bare mechanics of hockey (pass/shoot/hold) with on average 4-5 players. This is not even enough players to fill a single match. The characters they have clearly don't serve more than one purpose each, and somewhere along the lines everyone decided that instead of more play options we needed more cosmetic options. This is unjustifiable, and ACE has already burnt out their first impression on the steam community.I'm not giving this title any of my money or time. In my honest opinon they don't have the resources or the know-how to make this game catch on. If I'm wrong and we actually see this game take off, I'll happily change my reccommendation. But so far I'm not seeing this dev team take it above and beyond.			"

								This is what you would call a baby review. What I mean is that I only review on first impressions and how long it kept me playing on my first run. This game is epic in a very special way. It is something new that is both refreshing and could potentially bring some real skill based competition; if there were more players. My first and second game were all bots. That being said, I would have played much longer if I did not need to be up in the morning. Basically tomorrow I will be back to get a few more rounds in.

								I don't really get the negative reviews of A:CE. I know that nobody plays it, and has a lot of bugs, but if you just say ""This game sucks because of the players amount and bugs"", you'll never notice its beauty. You should tell everyone of this game, instead of just saying it's sh*t. A:CE has a nice community, daily tournaments, and Spearhead Games REALLY worked on it. They just don't get money for it, and for a developer/company it is not worth for wasting time and patience doing something that is already ""helpless"". If we could reach a certain point, where A:CE had at least 60 players continously playing, SHG would notice that the game is not dead, and would deal with A:CE (if they would get paid for it, of course).

								This game, on it's own, is great. Sure it has bugs, connection issues, so many unpolished features, etc. But the game, the actual concept and gameplay is amazing. And that's why it frustrates me so much that the game could be so much better. The only reason this game is even alive today is because of the amazing, albeit mircroscopic, community. Practically every day of the week, most people of the community come out to watch the stream and play. It's great. We make the most of what we have. But it's disappointing, because we could have so much more, but unfortunately we don't.Anyway, official streams end this week, and servers shut down mid-2017.

								Ok, this game is really cool, but also really hard to get the hang of.You move with the WSAD keys, hold onto the puck by holding down MB1, special powers with MB2/Spacebar, and aim/adjust power with moving the mouse. I'm not used to these kinds of controls, so for me it's really hard to get used to.The graphics are amazing! They're sort of like Borderlands, what with A:CE having a cell-shaded look.Audio is fairly good, I just hope they get voice actors soon.Game-wise, the matches get a bit old after awhile, so I wouldn't recommend playing it for hours on end. Otherwise it's a fun, enjoyable sports-styled game.I give it a recommendation to anyone looking for something fresh to try out.			"

								Potential is an overused word in early access + alpha games and the story here is no different. Fortunately ACE is free-to-play and you don't have to worry about throwing away money at something that may end up in the dumps--only time. The idea behind ACE is simple and amazing. A sports game MOBA w/ a net and a.. ba.. puck... When I first started following ACE it was supposed to play more like a 3v3 futsal/soccer MOBA. Unfortunately the devs have strayed away from this and keep trying to mold it into some sort of hockey game. It is really sad to see how much of that has been stretched and forced into this game at this point. However, this game is still fun if you are content with the following:Horrible lag (non-dedicated servers)LeaversInsanely stupid bots (that replace leavers)Horrific in-game chat systemGlitchy gameplayCollision detection worse than pongOne song (literally)This is an alpha game and I am not really complaining, and that's why I gave it a recommend as I do, in fact, recommend this game. However, the reason to play this game is not for the gameplay (although it can be very fun at times). But rather the idea of this game. With A LOT of polish or perhaps another dev team can come along and create a new game based off of this idea, this can be a new genre that could easily break into the e-sports scene. Download it, play it. Let's see what these Canadian devs can do.			"

The graphics are nicely cel-shaded and it has a rather unique style. The controls aren't perfect but the characters handle decently.The line connecting you and your teammates that changes color to indicate if a pass can be done is a very good idea.OVERALL : Not my thing, but very nice concept and realisation.

								This game... Is a strange one. At first you look at it and you think, ""Oh. It's a soccer game...?"" But it's much more than that, it's like an addiction. It's not just an ordinary soccer game, it's set waaaayyyyyyyy in the future like probably I don't know 3086 hence the ""Cyber Evolution"" so there is no ball, it's a disc, but you still have to try and shoot into the goal. And I mean literally 'shoot' the disc into the goal. People with that kind of technology don't kick. They just use the force or something and shoot it. Anyway, this game gets VERY addicting after your first round. Even on the tutorial and against bots! Which is sometimes needed because there aren't a whole lot of people playing yet which is downright STUPID. EVERY person on steam should have this game in their library and there are no if's, and's or but's about it I mean it's FREE. And if you're on steam you can probably run this game. Now, let me warn you though there are bugs in the game like every other game but it is in Alpha I believe, but it's the best damn Alpha game I've ever played and this was done in 3 months. Yeah. 3 months. The team did a great job on this game and I so recommend this game with the power of all reviews and the gaming gods above us, this game is a MUST HAVE. Unless you're a loser.			"

While the idea sounds asinine, this is a really fun game.  It's intense, wild, and a hell of a lot fo fun to play.  Definately try it out.			"

								Not a fan of multiplayer games generally, mainly because I'm not really all that competitive. However, this game feels pretty unique, and simple in the best ways. Assuming they get dedicated servers, and iron out all the bugs, then this game has some really awesome potential. Requires a fair amount of strategy, working as a team, and some good twitch reflexes. If you decide to hog the disc, and try to steal it from your team mate because you assume you're better, then you will lose. Especially if you aren't actually better. However, this scenario has been rare :). Go in with a fairly open mind, knowing there ARE some strange bugs still, and that you must work together, and you'll have a blast. If you're an ego maniac that wants to hold on to the disc(AKA:Ball) and rather do everything yourself, this probably isn't the game for you. Cheers.   PS: This game has a good monetization model.

I need to learn even more to play against HARD players!-Tweak a little bit the main menu ok? I am confused when I try to look for any option!-And many other cons.Conclusion?

								ACE - Arena: Cyber Evolution is a MOSA (Multiplayer Online Sports Arena) where it is PVP 3 vs 3 soccer-like game. It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Has a tutorial and practice game.  This game is in Early Access, seems like for a long time.  I guess certain heroes are better at goal tending and offence. You can have bots filling your matches slots, but the other side bots are great at offence and your team bots are terrible. If you have terrible players on your team, you might lose.  The game has 9 different heroes and 2 are on free rotatation, then You can buy heroes. There was some players on the server, some desperate for players, and Has NA and EU servers.  Game is styled as a future soccer e-sport played in cyberspace.  You can recruite players to your party of 3 and then play matches.  Game is challenging to play and get used to.Try it, you might like it.For more info:

You slide a bit after you stop pressing your button to move.Obvious objective is to get the tile (which acts as a puck) into the other teams goal.Customizeable armor and upgrades.Abilities can be used within the game that gives it a more challenging twist.

								Summary:This soccer-style game is obviously still in the early stages. The gameplay is fun, hold left mouse button down to hold the disk, and release to shoot. The cut-scene and runner artwork is very well done, the ""runners"" look cool and the heavily outlined style (similar to Borderlands) gives the game a cool comic book feel. The biggest downfall of this game has to be the home screen UI. It is bloated, outdated, and makes you feel like you're playing a pay-to-play game on facebook. All-in-all, the gameplay of Arena: Cyber Evolution is genuinely fun, though they need to focus on sharpening their UI, Increasing their player base, and balancing the runners. I'm going to give it a 2 stars (out of 5) with definite potential. Pros:-Gameplay is very fun. Moving with WASD and shooting the disk with the mouse feels good and fluid.-Intro stage is well done. The ""Entry Test"" is a good way to immerse the player while also teaching them to play. -Lines come off of your character to show where your allies and current aim are, giving the game a very cool geometric feel. -A lot of the artwork is really good, though the UI work is absolutely abhorrent. -The leveling system is clear and easy to understandCons:-Players move very slow. A small speed bost would help the flow of the game.-General character balance. There is a goalie ability that can pull the disk to them (even if the disk is already inside the goal) way too frequently. I suggest replacing this with a dive move or increasing the cooldown time to somewhere around a minute.-Bloated home screen UI. This is the first impression of the game and what people have to stare at while waiting for matches. Put some effort in to it. Things that need to happen before this game is good:-Update the awful UI. It looks bloated like a facebook game. -ENFORCE THE GOAL LINE. If the disk goes past the goal line it should be a point.-Show a quick replay of the goal after it is made.			"

I know that this game is in alpha, but there are 2 main problems that need to be fixed. First and most important, the framerate in the entire game (execpt for actual gameplay) is horrendous. I played 2 matches, but unfortunately can't stand to play any more of this game until they fix it. The second problem is that I can see this game getting old very fast because of current lack of game types. With these 2 poblems fixed. I can see his game becoming extremely popular/			"

								The game is basically Hokey with special power-ups dictated by the character you choose. It uses a League of Legends like Free to Play payment system. It's okay but with a lot of games it can become a grind. The game shows promise but the problem is it's a Multiplayer only game. It's basically 3v3 Future Hockey with special powers. If you like Hockey/Soccer you will probably like this game, just get some friends to play with because you'll be playing with AI otherwise.			"

								This is my first review on a game, here goes...TI've played two games so far and there is a TON of potential here, even in the early stage. This is easy to pick up and play, and fun. So far the downside is the lack of players online.That said, I'd like to see the pace of the game (mainly player move speed) increase a little bit, in game chat/voice chat, and a better skill interface (mainly seeing if something is on cooldown/number of charges a skill has on the screen somewhere other than under the player. (I may have missed it, again only two games played).The tutorial is very short, and honestly it doesn't need to be long, the game is that simple. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend playing, get your friends on, and developing a larger community for this game, it has so much potential and currently is only limited by the number of players online at a given time.

								EDIT: Game is much better!! It is better optimized, looks better, plays better, and I'm not having the same issues I was having before. I still have trouble finding matches, still want to like it, I don't know if it is there yet but I am excited to see how far it has come and if this keeps up I will defintily have tochange from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. I want to like this game, I really do, but I haven't even been able to play a match with real people, I can never seem to find anyone to play with which leaves me stuck practicing against bots. Your AI by the way are a bunch of morons.  Who spend most of the game either shooting it directly at the goalie, or passing the disk to the other team.     The game it self has lots of bugs. My favorites so far are steals from behind you, shooting the puck backwars? (it makes the noise) and a person behind you steals it or gets passed it cause they were close.. I don't know how, I wasn't even pointing that way, powers not going off when you activate them, but your cooldown starts.      I personally feel the controls are really sloppy, and I'll chock that one up to the game being in alpha. I don't like the control scheme they chose for the game, it is slow, impossible to make quick reactions to enemy actions with. In a sports game I want to be able to be agile and nimble especially when I'm playing a character who is suppossed to be like that.     I really like the visual for the game, but I have a pretty big complaint that may inolve them. Why does this game require a 3Ghz processor? The graphics are not that good to require that much processing power. The game itself shouldn't be that demanding, it's 6 players. My computer can run games that look twice as nice, have a lot more people, and are much more complex than this. I have major lag issues at the menu screen, not in game, but at the menu screen.      I can not reccomend this game at all in its current form, I will continue to keep my eye on it, to see if gets better, which I hope it will, because I can see the potential, but potential is not enough.  If they create a solid experiance with tight, responsive controls and little to no bugs, It would be highly reccomended.			"

								What is a good game? A question posed by the great scholars of not only our generation, but the generations that preceeded us. Up there with the likes of 'Why are we here', 'Is there a god' and 'Why do kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?'. Up until this day, this question has never been answered. Which is why I'm here.A good game invokes emotion. A good game tells a story. A good game, is a good game. ACE checks all but one of these boxes. ACE gets you to jump out of your seat, fist pumping in the air as you score that game-winning post goal. ACE gets you, head in hands, groaning at the incompotency of your goalie. ACE gets you to do all of this, and more. But what ACE doesn't do, is tell a story. What ACE does, is give the player, the oppurtunity to craft their OWN story. Their OWN legend. A game rich with replayability, a game rich with no glass ceiling, a game rich with a budding, growing e-sports scene. ACE let's you tell your own tale, your tale of bounce shots, your tale of overtime stress-fests, your tale of that one time where you scored a goal by bouncing the puck off their goalie. No other game does this, because no other game can. ACE acheives what very many dream of, but even more will never ever achieve.Outside of the game, you find the company. The team behind, and pardon the rhyme, the dream. Spearhead Games. Responsible for such successes as Tiny Brains, as Stories. As ACE. With a community manager that cares, and a team of streamers dedicated to bringing you the best content they can at hitbox.tv/spearheadgames or twitch.tv/spearheadgames ACE is constantly changing. ACE isn't just a game. Spearhead Games isn't just a company. These two things, brought together, are a fire. A fire that we, the players. We, the viewers. We, the dreamers, stoke. Fuelling that desire to reach for the stars then bring them back. Flames licking at heros. Smoke billowing into the endless sky, the endless possibilites. I can only tell you so much about ACE. I can only put into words, how great this game is, if you just give it a chance. It's up to you to decide if you like the game. But take it from someone whose not being to paid to say this, but will lose his job if he doesn't.ACE, pretty ace.			"

By far the best part of this game though is the competitive atmosphere of the game and the ability to watch the devs on twitch and keep up to date on whats going to be added soon. Unfortunately this game is in beta so not a ton of players are on, but weekdays at 7 PM EST theres usually a game you can join. On a side note i would just like to point out that all the negative reviews literally just played the tutorial... they didnt even play an actual match before saying how bad the game is. It's absolutely an amazing game and dont listen to those bogus negative comments.			"

								A wise man once said ""to make a great video game you have to capture a moment in time, whether it's 5 minutes, or an hour. After you have that moment you have to expand upon it until it's something that people not only love, but will cherish for years"". I know that it's entirely pre-emptive to say that A:CE will be around for years to come; but I hope it does, I really do. The controls are smooth, the matches are fast-paced and involving, and the art is amazing. The developers have done an excellent job of making everyone on the team feel important also. Slower PC ? Don't have the fine-tuned twitch reflexes of someone who's been playing NHL games for a decade ? Doesn't matter. You can be a lumbering goalie and STILL play an exceedingly rewarding (and more importantly; necessary) role for your team. A:CE strays from other MOBA games in that ""tanking"" or ""support"" is FUN! You might not be as fast as a forward, but there's nothing like freezing the enemy team solid on your side of the court, passing a rink-long pass, and watching your forward breeze by the goalie. It's teamwork personified; and it's FUN.Give this game a try guys. I never-ever write reviews, but I just had brag on this diamond-in-a-very-rough stone that are other MOBA-type games.			"

								To the developers - This is a fun game but PLEASE do something about the game automatically ending if the host leaves. There have been numerous times where my team has been up by a few points and the host (supposedly on the losing team) will leave the match. All the stats from that match go right out the window as the game ends abruptly which really sucks. Maybe a possible solution could be switching the host to one of the other remaining players instead of the match ending. Otherwise, I've enjoyed my time so far with Arena: Cyber Evolution.			"

								A wise man once said ""to make a great video game you have to capture a moment in time, whether it's 5 minutes, or an hour. After you have that moment you have to expand upon it until it's something that people not only love, but will cherish for years"". I know that it's entirely pre-emptive to say that A:CE will be around for years to come; but I hope it does, I really do. The controls are smooth, the matches are fast-paced and involving, and the art is amazing. The developers have done an excellent job of making everyone on the team feel important also. Slower PC ? Don't have the fine-tuned twitch reflexes of someone who's been playing NHL games for a decade ? Doesn't matter. You can be a lumbering goalie and STILL play an exceedingly rewarding (and more importantly; necessary) role for your team. A:CE strays from other MOBA games in that ""tanking"" or ""support"" is FUN! You might not be as fast as a forward, but there's nothing like freezing the enemy team solid on your side of the court, passing a rink-long pass, and watching your forward breeze by the goalie. It's teamwork personified; and it's FUN.Give this game a try guys. I never-ever write reviews, but I just had brag on this diamond-in-a-very-rough stone that are other MOBA-type games.			"

								To the developers - This is a fun game but PLEASE do something about the game automatically ending if the host leaves. There have been numerous times where my team has been up by a few points and the host (supposedly on the losing team) will leave the match. All the stats from that match go right out the window as the game ends abruptly which really sucks. Maybe a possible solution could be switching the host to one of the other remaining players instead of the match ending. Otherwise, I've enjoyed my time so far with Arena: Cyber Evolution.			"

								This game is insanely fun to play! It's a 3v3 game that seriously has competitive play for sure! Holy crap! Best of all.. it's Free!! AND none of it is Pay to win! The in game store is simply cosmetic items, EXP boost, and missions to earn more coins.If you purchase Spearhead points you are eligible to buy;Cosmetic Items: Hats and skins.EXP Boost: Buy a 3 win boost or higher to boost your exp leveling faster after each round. Missions: You will have daily missions such as win a game, score a goal, get an assist. Completing these will give you normal cash points.If you wish to unlock a character like in LoL for example, You can use normal points you earn from every round you play(They cost around 2000 points however it is easy to get these points so do not panic!) OR buy some spearhead points to get it much faster.Seriously.. this game will not disappoint.SO GIVE IT A GO! BRING SOME FRIENDS AND KICK SOME ♥♥♥!			"

Early Access Review
								The game deserves positive reviews. The game is fairly buggy at the moment, the servers could be better, and there is barely anyone playing, but i have a lot of fun playing this. I really enjoy the gameplay, which mostly resembles hockey, if compared to any real sports, but it really isn't much like hockey and you need to try it to see how it works. The game can be quite confusing or chaotic until you get used the unique special abilities that each runner have. Once you get familiar with those and learn what to be aware of it really becomes a blast trying to outsmart the opposing players and avoiding playing into their strenght. Teamplay is at the heart of the game, and you need to work together with your team mates when teams are about evenly matched. The game may seem pretty dead, but most days of the week there are streams where the active players tune in and have mini tournements, casual games, and the 2 weekly ""main"" tournements on saturday and sunday. I can personally attest that the vets are very tolerant of new players, so don't be afraid if you aren't very good yet, get some practice playing the mini tourneys and casuals. The devs working on a new engine for the game which hopefully improves upon some current issues. Give it a try, it's a very fun game despite the current issues.			"

								Got the founders pack in a Humble Bundle ages ago. Finally got around to trying this game out today and there was only 1 person online. The game itself seems great. I really liked the feel of it in the tutorial but sadly with so few players there isn't really a point. I hate to see games with so much potential die like this.It is a loop when games like this just don't catch on. People stop playing because there are not enough players and no new players start because there aren't enough people playing :(Perhaps if it ever comes out of early access more people will start playing it and it will revive itself but I doubt that will happen. I guess it would be an ok game to play at a lan party or something but other than that don't bother			"

								In a nutshell, this game is 3 on 3 hockey/soccer, with different archetypes/characters:Enforcer/GoalieStriker/ForwardSupport/Midfield...and a few more interesting ones available to unlock/purchase and more on the way.At it's core, the simplicity of the game is why it is so much fun. It's very intuitive to control, and very rewarding when you are able to outmaneuver the opposing team(when they are putting up a good fight). That being said, there is a strange depth to the game- no match plays the same, and every day people are learning new things to play better and evolve the experience. Different team roles, different passing opportunities, juking, blocking, zoning.. I feel that this game has tremendous legs if it gets the chance to stretch them and run, and I would love to see it go far, as I would love to be able to keep playing it. The playerbase is still relatively small, but it is only growing. Please support the devs, play the game, and spread it around to your friends.almost forgot, the cons:it's pre-alpha. there are bugs. occasionally a host will drop. sometimes you cant get in the game with your buddies. There are little things here and there, stuttery animations, lag spikes.. usual growing pains. The devs are being very open about what they are doing and what their priorities are- to be honest, even in the current state its more fun than I've recently had playing anything else. "

								The controls were just far to bizarre for me, my underwhelming ultra-special move didn't even work for a full bout (I pressed Space a lot and not once did it trigger), and I can never tell when my AI team mate is going to pass to me (I haven't tried live players yet- I don't feel like the controls are natural enough to even consider it). Plus, I can never seem to catch the puck. Banging the left mouse button to steal and then having to _hold_ that same button to keep the puck (and then _release_ the button to shoot) is immensely counter-intuitive. The whole time I felt like I was fighitng the controls. The WASD thing just seems like a terrible design choice- something more akin to a space simulator movement system seems like a better fit- where you have a ""thrust"" button, with directionality based on the mouse facing. I can see what they are trying to do, akin to an old double-joystick shooter, but it just doesn't feel ""right"". I would much rather see it ""catch"" the puck without much input, and reserve holding down the button to ""power up"", then release to shoot if they are going to do it that way (something like the old NHL hockey games from my youth). At least then you'd have a little variability on how you were shooting, rather than every shot going at the same speed (unless you manage to hit it with your special move, that is). ""Events"" are massively annoying with how counter-intuitive the controls already are- they need to be something that can be turned off, especially when first learning the game. And the game seems to memory leak something fierce- after two or three bouts everything lags and I have to shut it down and reload. The graphics settings don't seem to work right- the game looked fine until I went to look at the resolution options, and then, not changing resolution at all, it suddenly went all stretched out like the aspect ratio is wrong. I didn't select anything, I just opened up the drop-down and left it right where it was. And full screen versus windowed mode should stick between sessions. Also, it seems that some of the time when you check ""full screen"" it actually remains in windowed mode and vice-versa. All in all a really rocky start for what sounds like a fairly interesting concept. But I can't stomach the controls or the other issues after playing for nearly an hour. Uninstalled. Not recommended.			"

								Played 7 games, lost 5 due to having all the low level players and a bot versus teams of players who knew the game well. Gameplay is good but its hard to sustain interest when there is such a steep learning curve due to unbalanced teams. Tutorial was the bare minimum of how to play with one character and its trial and error with the other two. No idea how the coin system works other than it costs a ridiculous amount for new things. Will change my review if these issues are fixed but I doubt they will be seen to.			"

								Haven't played this game with my friend yet, but,1. Bot AI is terrible. I'm sorry, I have to be this callous. Seriously.40% of the time, my bot teammates are PASSING THE BALL TO THE ENEMY.FIGURATIVELY.2. Slideshow on main menu is broken. First two slides are a solid, lime green colour.3.PLEASE render it in 60fps.4. PLEASE.5. My eyes are bleeding.5/10 But I believe in improvement. This IS early access, after all.			"

								Cant recommend the game im sorry, The devs were awesome with the community at first, but never listen to the main complaint they had: U guys need to put money on ads to bring new player to the game and keep it alive. I ALWAYS played against bot, if u want to play against other players u had to play on devs stream hours. They just keep burning the money the have left and the game will just die. Its a shame srs cuz the game is freaking awesome with a team against other players.Its sad because the main problem would have been resolve with more ads on Steam but they never did!			"

								An early-access game as I write this. The self-proclaimed MOBA that is ACE - Arena styles itself as a mix between Borderlands and Speedball, with gameplay mechanics to match the latter, and a visual style closer to that of the former.Presently, the game suffers from a very minimal amount of graphical customisation (that I could find easily) - and as such the framerate really suffered - and sadly the servers were devoid of human players to interact with. I played a single game after the tutorial against bots, and thoroughly had my rear kicked. That said, the game shows promise - if it's able to overcome its graphical issues, and perk up the controls (which are very 'heavy' feeling, and sticky!) - then I feel this game will warrant a return, but in the meantime I simply cannot recommend this to anyone but the most devoted enthusiast or those with monstrous machines!I've recorded my gameplay for those who may be interested:

								I'm not big into E-Sports, but Arena: Cyber Evolution has now become one of my favourite games. The goal is to get the disk into the opposing teams goal. First team to score the most goals wins the game. Not only does the game have non-stop action, but it also looks awesome. The visuals are stunning, the gameplay is great, and the fun is ongoing. I see much potential for this game. I hope we can have a tournament for Arena: Cyber Evolution one day. I think there should be a voice chat for each team during the game however. Other than that, this game is incredible! 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								Okay I know what you're thinking ""this guy has only played 0.1 hours of the game so he has no idea what he's talking about"". Just here me out. This game has issues from the get go. After my first of the game, I had no desire to play further. For starters, the AI is the worst I have ever seen. My goalie started with the puck, turned around and shot it in our own goal. 4 times. same thing from the other team. Their goalie either just handed it to my team or just turned around and shot it in his own goal. On top of that, i had no issues with framerate, but it is slow. The movement speed is simply slow and not engaging. A game about space hockey should be fun, energetic and exciting! However it just doesnt feel that way. In a game centered on sport action, the last thing you want is boredom as the player is running across the field to score a goal. I understand that this is early access, but if you're going to release a game to the public you need to make sure that it works. The bugs in this game can range from annoying to ""are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious?"". I'm sure these will all be fixed in the future but when you want to get some fans early on, the last thing you want is to drive them away with a game that infuriates them. As many others say, it's a good premise. However as it stands, it's a boring game that needs improvement. I would reccomend for starters, to make the game faster paced. This way new players can look past some of the bugs and feel the rush of scoring a goal or intercepting a pass. Fast paced action in a game like this is key. Next, fix the bugs. I'm sure that they will, but making a game public access with bugs like this is not smart if you want people to buy your ""adopter"" packs and such. Nobody wants to put money into a game that has bugs like these. I want this game to succeed I really do, I wouldn't have written this otherwise (I'm sure my gramatical errors show that I'm in a rush to type this). But it needs improvement. Early Acces is becoming more and more of a grey area as more and more games accept the practice, and if you want to compete, you cannot make a game like this public. It needs time is all, just give it some time.			"

								The notion behind the game is great; with the success that mobas have had, it's only a matter of time before we see the rise of a mosa; a sports-like game that people can play in teams competetively. Unfortunately, there are a number of things that make me suspect this game will not be what the world will choose.The mechanics of the game are simple, but the scale of the game itself, as well as the magnitude of that simplicity, hinder it. I just don't feel like there is enough variation possible in the gameplay, Sure, with 6 players on the field things can get intense for a few seconds at a time, but since it takes very little to deduce what works and what doesn't, there really isn't a whole lot going on at any given moment. It is arcade-y in its simplicity, and whilst that does make it easy to learn and easy to play, it ultimately limits the complexity of the end result.The controls feel very sluggish; nothing close to the tight, precise, responsiveness you would want from a highly competetive game. There also seems to be a lot of pushing towards the microtransactions, which is understandable for a free game, but the way it is presented is not flattering.For all the hype, this is merely 6-player ice hockey with a garishly stylised presentation.

 Arena: Cyber Evolution A game with great potential. Visual: 7/10 The game has quite nice graphics, but is obviously low budget. The game has bright colours and an art-style that looks like most futuristic movies and games (meaning games with shiny futuristic objects, not to be confused with dystopian future.). Sound: 7/10 The music in ACE is quite good, and is futuristic techno nonsense (which is not a bad thing.). Besides the music there is not alot of sound effects that get noticed. There is a crowd that cheers when you score a goal but that's just about it. There's not more to say really. Gameplay: 7/10 The game has a hero system like League of Legends or Dota, but it's a futuristic sports game instead of being a 3-lane 5v5 game. Each character has two different abilities that can change the game drastically, such as the teleport ability or the ability to place a wall on the map. Besides the superpowers the game is basically a football game (I'm from Europe, so I guess it's soccer for the Americans reading this.). The game would've been rated higher if it weren't for the fact that it's basically dead. Free To Play: 9/10 The game is entirely free to play, but you can purchase the heroes and skins for real money. This would normally be an issue for me but there are only 8 characters to play ( of which 4 are owned to begin with.). "

								This game is pretty good, don't get me wrong. But I don't have much good to say about the bot AI. I've had bots pass to the other team, shoot at our own goal, and I've never seen a Nitrogen Queen bot ever use an ability. I've seen the bots just start spinning in place because the disc ended up behind the goal, and they had no idea what to do. I'm really looking forward to the game's release so I can play with players instead of bots.			"

								Very interesting game and I would like to play more. Futuristic 'ice hockey' sort of game but with a super tiny community. (I couldnt enter a match at all though the requirements was 3v3)Simple cartoonish graphics for those who appreciate it like 'Viewtiful Joe'. It does have potential to be a very big game. Just need to work on the popularity.Pros:1) Simple! No complicated and abundant controls like FPS or Flight Simulators. Easy game mechanics.2) Nice SFX, gives the futuristic feel3) Still in early access! This means that more improvements will be made.4) Free to play!5) Experience game. What I mean is that you'll get better through experience. I personally like this aspect many much unlike some games (*Stanley Parable* where you dont need experience to play)Cons:1) No one is playing. Game needs more promotion and popularity2) No Practice. There is a tutorial at the start, but there's no practice with bots mode for times when I cannot find a matchmake3) No sensitivity control. One thing about this game that was considered difficult for me is aiming. Because the sensitivity is too darn high.Please Recommend This Game To Friends			"

								I played 10 games. Lost all 10.The idea is cool and the game HAS potential but controls never feel allright. You move your champ into a soccer-like camp, it's a 3vs3 game where 1 is the ""goalkeeper"". As I said, the idea is cool, but you use WASD for moving and the mouse to point the direction you're holding the ""ball"". The problem is that! You can't be reactive enough spinning around your champ the mouse while moving, you don't know when your team mate wants to pass it to you so you don't know when to turn and activate your holding ability.Bot players hves an evident advantage because they react perfectly and know where to go, while you are always less reative and can't cooperate with your team mates.The game has a short (and useless) tutorial which explains nothing: it doesn't explain your abilities, when to use them, any basic strategy, roles.It also has a Pay2Win system. You can buy skins but also movement and ability boosters althogh they give like 6% boost to them.Maybe if you were using a controller things would be better. Maybe if you were matched with real players and using skype or teamspeak things would be better. Maybe if it had a true tutorial with challenges and control trining it would be better. Maybe if it was less frenetic things would be better. Maybe.... Maybe...5/10			"

								It's fun for a little bit, it essentially plays like a hockey game. Though you're better off playing a hockey game like EA's NHL series. This game is 3v3, which feels a bit sparse, doesn't leave much room for strategy. Each character has a set of special moves, but they're mostly a non-factor. It's nice that you can play with bots, means you don't have to wait around for people, but it's no substitute for real players. On a positive note, I love the art style.			"

								I am gonna have to say, this game is super good. The concept is amazing.Now that you know my overall opinion here is my pros and cons about this game.Pros:- Concept unique and works really well- playfield is small which makes it more intense- design fits the game*- got the potential- if can't find players you get to play bots that are actually quite challengingcons:- really no players - design looks like borderlands**I know I mention design both places but that is because I like how they made the design the same style overall and not a hyper realistic field and players in this cartoony style. However I am not a fan of that style of game which is also why I disliked the Borderlands Franchise. But if you like that style then this game will look amazing to you.			"

								Isn't the point of an Early Access free situation to allow testers and get some feedback from them? If I am correct then why do you allow three heroes, then the other two you lock out from people at 3000 credits worth, meanwhile you earn 70 credits per match. Meanwhile you made sure that your pay shop was lined with stuff to buy, meanwhile your credit shop you kinda skimped or don't care enough to treat f2p right.			"

								I would not reccomend this game in it's current state. The controls aren't that innovative as they say. The movement is incredibly slow and painful. There are no explanations of each of the characters powers besides a video. The gameplay feels like a slowed down barebones version of hockey with various stage events that add very little to the experience. You can even steal the disc from your teammates, which is a terrible design choice. The only decent thing about this game (In my opinion) are the cartoony graphics and models and interesting characters. I can see a lot of potential for this game but, right now, it's not quite there yet.			"

								I think think i have ever seen a game with worse balacing issues. People that have played this game more than others don't just unluck new skills, but thoes skill are SO CRAZY much better than the original that even thoe we had a team that played better and the oposing team did, we still lost 0-15 cause they just had better skills. Think i'm just a noob that don't know anything about balance and just whine cause i lost? well i have been into gaming for 20 years and have 5 years experiance in doing gamebalance for games.If you don't trust me, go try for yourself, but don't come back and say i didn't warn you!Oh and did i mention Pay2Win? i beleve i did yes....

OverviewAs a big supporter of unique sports games, I wanted to like this game. Everything surrounding it, including the tutorial, was very fun and helpful. I liked everything about it until I played a game.Pros‣ Well-Designed Menus‣ Helpful Tutorial‣ Competitive RanksCons‣ Glitchy Gameplay‣ Poor Optimization‣ Low Player Counts on Servers (Always matched up with bots)‣ 1 American Server (Based in Montreal)Final ThoughtsI really, really wanted to like this game. It sounded so good that I had to try it. The problems with this game are not unfixable though. If you read this review and still want to give this game a try, go ahead, because it's free and quick to download. If the developers can fix the problems with the gameplay and matchmaking, I would definitely recommend this game.			"

								I wanted to like this game, but the controls are among the worst I've ever seen.Basically, you have to click the left mouse to grab the ""disc"". And hold it to keep hold of the disk. Your opponent can immediately grab it back, leading to a series of back and forth snatches until one of you screws up or magically rotates your player. Timing needs to be perfect or close to it to actually catch the disc. Opponents can magically scoop the disc from behind you, even if this is how the tutorial tells you to avoid getting it stolen.Holding the disc drains stamina, which is a nearly-invisible circle that appears in front of you. LITERALLY UNDER THE DISC if you're holding it. Basically the worst possible visual choice the game could have made for a necessary mechanic.This is a pre-release review, so it's entirely possible that some of these things get worked out, particularly the visual issue. However, I would be extremely surprised if the controls are fixed, since I think that's the whole design concept, so this game may as well be radioactive. Great idea, among the worst execution I've seen.			"

								After playing a couple of matchs of the game online I could not play it anymore. The lag is horrible and is a major destraction. Now don't get me wrong, the concept for this game is really good. But the exacution of this amazing idea is not the greatest. It quickly grew boring for me and there isn't alot of people online. If the lag and the akward controls could be fixed this game would be worth playing. But in this current state the game is almost unplayable. I hope that this game does succsed and hope to see it enter beta, but until then I am going to move on. If you can get around the lag this game is good.			"

Early Access Review
								I went into this one with no expectations and having no idea what the point of the game was at all. I think that made the experience better. That being said, it’s an early access game with definite room for improvement, but it gets a few things right. Let’s begin.TLDR: Not RecommendedThe GoodACE – Arena: Cyber Evolution is like futuristic air hockey, only it’s played at a life-size scale. You can select from a few characters to play as (others you have to unlock through in-game currency). Each character has special abilities he or she can use to aid you and your team on the path to victory. I’m sure most of us (if not all of us) have played air hockey before. It’s fun and it’s a fairly acceptable way to kill some time. As the game stands now in it’s current state, that’s the highest praise I’ll be giving it. A dressed up game of air hockey.The BadAs I mentioned above, some characters need to be unlocked through in-game currency. The same holds for character customization options (skins and the like). Most of it you’d be forking over actual currency to get and that, to me, is an utter waste for a game like this.The game has only two resolution settings, neither of which fit my monitor. Sad day.The only other real complaint I had had to do with the controls. Well, one specific control. Holding down the left mouse button allows you to grab and hold onto the disc (puck). Releasing the left mouse button (in theory) allows you to shoot the disc in the direction your cursor is facing. 70% of the time when I tried to shoot the disc, it floated in front of me in a pathetic manner and this often resulted in the enemy team taking control of it.The MehInitially, I thought the artwork for the game looked like it was going to be my kind of thing. It has a sort of Borderlands-esque feel to it, right? Not so much. Actual in game graphics didn’t really do it for me. They just seemed lacking.This game is very much an online game. However, I played for a good long while and only ever had matches with bots. the community is, for all intents and purposes, much like a cemetery. You don’t need other players to play, luckily. As I said, you can play with bots.Verdict: NayWhile part of me feels this is a bit harsh for a free-to-play game, I just can’t bring myself to recommend it as it is now. Maybe once it hits it’s final release I will revisit it and give it another go. Until then, I think I’ll stick to real air hockey and I would advise all of you to do the same. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												A fun idea for sure.However, it has some poor movement, awefull abilities which without proper training are hard to realy use properly.The AI is working against you, stealing your disc or shoots at you while you least expect it.To get the disc back you have to hold left mouse while looking at it, but AI can do the same.so it's more like who's got the best stealing skills.Also i.m.h.o. it has some weird mouse view for your character to turn.i'm sorry to say this game is not recommended by me.Also the music is getting anoying after a while.And trying to score becomes a tedious task.I've played for a couple of minutes, finished all the tutorials.and then uninstalled.

								Depending on how long you've been gaming, you will either see this game as yet another future team sports game, or the first of its kind.  The genre had been done to death by the late 80's/early 90's, but this game has online multiplayer which sounded like fun.Unfortunately, there is rarely anyone online. The most it's ever shown is one person online as it spent 3 minutes trying to connect a game unsucessfully. For all I know, that one person was just me. In short, MP is pretty much a no-go depending on which time zone you are in. I'm yet to find anyone else to play with.This leaves you to play against the bots, which would be fine if you had any control over your own team. Unfortunately, you only control one player or  at least try to with the slow and clunky controls, but that doesn't matter as your team rarely pass to you anyway. You are left running around on your own as one hogs the disk while your goalie usually ends up as the highest scorer... for the other team.  Lots of own goals.  First rule of team sports games -  The player controls whoever has the ""ball"" or at least has the ability to pass to and from bots. Otherwise its just BORING.Without the inability to switch players on your team or even find anyone online, it's just not fun at all and there's really nothing new here. I wanted to like this game, and as it's still in early development, there's lots of room for improvement. As it is though, it's still pretty buggy, low on content, lacks any depth and has microtransactions for useless gear. I can't recommend this to anyone.			"

								This game was fun the first two matches. Then you realize there's no way to see what the controls are. There's no way to talk to your team or to invite friends to your team. People are incredibly unskilled at this game and will cause you to lose repeatedly. There is no way to put someone on a ""do not invite this person on my team again."" People will purposely score points for the OTHER team and troll you without any recompense. If you wanted to actually have a skill for skill competition, look elsewhere. I understand it's early access but the 5 total characters to choose from are not very well balanced unless you can get on VOIP with your teammates somehow. Until then the ""tactics"" support characters are useless.TL:DR I used my ""speed up a teammate"" power on my teammate... then he flew past our afk goalie and shot the disc into our own net scoring a goal for the enemy team. 3/10.

								I have played this game a hand full of times for only a little more than 1 hour. And two patches. All I can say is, this game isn't for me, but could be for you. Let me start off by saying that the controls can feel off at times, like you think you grabbed the puck, but the server says no. The servers were the worst part of this game. I couldn't get a stable connection to save my life. Even on NA, where I live.The UI in this newest patch, doesn't even have the text on it. Are you serious? How difficult is it to add text to a box? Not very, I've done it many times.All I can say is, the game had potential, now I don't think so. It feels like the devs are putting more time into their newest game, then trying to work on the bugs in this one. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.			"

								I don't like this game.  Three big reasons.1) Game is Pay-To-Win.  Sure it's a free-to-play game, but just look at some of the features and powerful abilities you get if you ""buy"" into the game.  Players who pay real world money get experience boosters for one, which means with even playing time, they will have higher level, more advanced players against yours.  Not only that, but with real money, they can go ""invisible""??  o.O.  Come on. I hate P2W games, period.2) Another major gripe from me is that this game is super sluggish and slow.  There's no reason for a game with graphics this simple to feel so sluggish and molasses slow, period.  It's supposed to be a sports game, which would tend to make you believe fast paced action.  Instead, it feels too slow, there are RPG games that move faster then this!  Ugh. Zzzzz.3) No dedicated servers for online connections.  Privately hosted servers mean that this game will most certainly be flooded with hackers and cheaters when you play online, just a matter of time.If you want to play a really good game like this, and you own either a Playstation 1, a Playstation 2, or a Playstation 3... then look on Ebay or at your used video game store and grab a game called 'Dead Ball Zone"".  It shouldn't cost you more then $5 USD.  That game, made in 1998, is very much like this one, but done correctly.  It moves fluid and fast.  It allows you to punch, smash, and assault the other players to try and steal the ball.  And it is at least ten times better then this, even though it was made on a PS1 and made sixteen years ago.

								It’s like a blindfolded slap fight. Like the consept but not the gameI seldom lost a match and felt like, ""wow, they did such a good job"" I mostly felt like I was fighting the controls. Not that they aren’t tight. It’s the mechanical choices they made, NOT sloppy game play. I feel like the players should move faster, be smaller (or thinner) and bump into each other with less or more of an affect.  The powers are underwhelming, there is no indication I can see in a reasonable time to know if a pass is coming towards you, and there is a strange need to only let you hold the puck of like 5 seconds, so you have to pass; even in you are surrounded by three people on the enemy team.Over all I really like the concept, but found the gameplay really growling. It eventually just became 6 people spamming the L-Mouse and bumping into each other. I think it’s great that there are fans of the game and hope it develops into something really fun, but in its current state it’s not for me. The pace is too slow.Good luck to you! Art style is also sweet. "

								As a 1000+ hours vet(who doesn't play this anymore) I can tell you not to download this game. First of all the lag between servers is terrible - the best team in the world(which doesn't say much since there are around 20-25 actual players, no joke) keeps losing to a team comprised of new players when they play on the Europe server. If you're from NA I'll tell you that this game will be a very negative experience for you because out of those 20-25 players, at least 15 are from Europe, so you'll be playing on their server more often than not.Also, you can't play this game outside of tournaments. The reason is that there aren't enough players, you will only play against bots. Again, unless you're from Europe, but even then you'll only have a specific 1-2 hours to play against real players. So if you don't like playing tournaments you won't be able to play this game.Also, the game balance is embarrassing, and there are MANY bugs/head-scratching decisions made by devs. Don't expect the devs to make changes, because the main guy(btw, they have said on stream that they have two people working on ACE only) said on stream that they don't like listening to the community. I will say the main reason for most people who stop playing this game(as they told me) was the community manager. In fact there's at least one other review complaining about the devs. You'll see why in less than a week after downloading this game. If you look at the steamcharts page for this game, you'll notice that they are losing players instead of gaining. It's not a coincidence.To recap...The game in its current state is not worth your time, and the devs have made it clear they will not be improving it. And the ONLY way to play this game against real players is to participate in tournaments, which are organized by the community manager, which means it will be impossible for you to avoid him.Do yourself a favor and don't download this game, even if you're from Europe.

												32 bit OS are now supported by Project Cyber. I noticed on sending the mail. Thank you!Why this crаp is not going to 32 bit os? I asked a friend, how are you game? He replied: connect and could not find a match in the morning. then something has launched (bots can be) but they were not moving. So I realized that the developers do not care for other players who do not have a 64 bit OS "

								(I tend to dislike sports in real life, as most people who know me know. BUT I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME! It's fast paced, easy to get into, and really enjoyable even for those of us who arn't that much into sports.) That was the Old Review. I liked the game. But even when I played it, there weren't many people to play against. Looking back at it, it was barely alive. Taking a quick glance at it now, it has a common problem that are involved in these types of games. The concept and gameplay are great, but theirs no way they can afford to put this game on the map anymore. Think of it like Gun of Icarus, for those of you who own the game. It only has an average of a few hundred players, but it should be having thousands. What I'm getting at here, is that the game is more or less has a dead community. A game with a dead community wont last much longer in this cruel world.			"

								PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been playing it for a little less than a week and I have fallen in love with the game and the community.Pros-Unique gameplayFriendly communityDeveloper envolvementEasy to learn hard to masterSeveral events through the weekCons-This game is still in early access so there are occassional bugs and glitchesThe bots are too difficult for beginner playersThe community is too small as it is so matchmaking normally puts you in a game with botsThat all being said I would highly reccomend this game to anyone!! It is a really fun game which I'm sure will evolve and possibly spark the MOSA genre. I also hope to see more games from Spearhead Games. Keep up the great work guys!!! :)Edit: THIS GAME HAS GONE SO FAR DOWNHILL IT ISN'T EVEN FUNNY. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WITH THE GAME SINCE THE BEGINNING HAVE BECOME SO TOXIC IT RUINS EVERYTHING!!!

Early Access Review
								I am going to assume by the time you read this you have checked out some trailers of the game and you pretty much know what this game is about. In a nutshell the game is an intergalatic air hockey simulator in which you pick a Runner and try to score goals. You play against another team of up to 3 players. Matches last 5 minutes and if undecided run into sudden death, where a golden goal principe is enforced. I like the competive element of the game, it feels like a real sport.First the bad: I tried the game a few months back and it was still very much an early access product. It lacked proper dedicated servers and the interface was cluncky at best. It also had quite a few serious bugs, like loading screens timing out or games starting and not being balanced properly (3v2 or 1v4). At the time I quit, but hey, the game was in early access and it didn't claim to be anything else. Now the good: About two weeks back I logged back in and was pleasantly suprised: dedicated servers, loading bugs completely fixed and a new slick interface (that naturally could still use some work here and there). It has come to a point where I would definitely recommend the game. There are still some issues, for example some problems with quests registering multiple times, but the core game itself is solid, fun and very easy to get into. The worst problem at the moment though is the limited number of players. Personally I don't mind playing some bots every now and again, but when this happens a lot the game loses some of its tension, because it is great to face off against other players. Besides, the game is free, so why not give it a bash. My final thoughts? With some more players this game would be great fun. It feels amazing to score that deciding goal a few seconds before the timer runs out, let alone win a match that has run into sudden death by a well timed shot or a great long pass. Do yourself a favor and check out Arena: Cyber Evolution, or ACE for short.			"

								Fun game, it's a quick 5 min 3v3 air hockey type game. Haven't played enough to know, but this game seems pretty balanced and skill-based. You pretty much just have a goalie then the other 2 work together passing and using their abilities to try and score on the other goal. I'd recommend it as a nice game to play when you're bored or don't have time to play another games, as well as just fun in general. Teamwork is pretty important, but so far playing alone it's not too team-reliant that solo players should feel worried. Overall I'd say this game relies on quick decision making and response times.

								Extremely fun ""MOSA"" game that immerses you into a cyberpunk similar environment where you play a sport that's essentially futuristic 3-on-3 hockey. Microtransactions are there yet they aren't the typical kind that make the game unplayable to those who would rather not dish out the money to ""pay-2-win"". The characters are very unique and each one of them has a different skillset. While there may not be a huge variety of characters like some people want, the ones that are there are sufficient enough considering each game only has six people on the field at once. Very competitive feeling and an undeniably exciting experience all around.			"

								Excelent game. The concept is so simple. At first glance it seems like a mixture of hockey and soccer. But it is so much more then that.The inivative control scheme is pure genious and though it may take some time to master, when you do master it you will apreciate it so much more. The Runners are extremly well thought out and compliment each other perfectly. The developers have clearly put alot of work and thought into this game and it shows! Best of all they are still working on it. 10/10 best early access game i have ever played!			"

Early Access Review
								I was initially impressed by the game but seeing how the developers make mistake after mistake by prioritizing cosmetics and new Runners over actual much-needed content (more game modes, more maps, etc.) I'm starting to feel dissappointed by the game. There is only one gamemode, on one map, there's no midgame/endgame etc. to have the game actually develop during a match. The in-game controls are far too simple and lacking for what is considered by the devs as an eSport game. Things such as curve-shots, shot-power regulation, team-passing etc. are missing making the gameplay very shallow gameplay. While this was originally promoted as a community-driven game, the developers have completely moved away from this concept; there is very little room for community input or willingness to engage in discussions which hints at sheer arrogance from the developers' side that they can simply build a competitive game without the input from the playerbase. While some of the developers have prior experience in the gaming industry, as a company Spearhead Games has almost no history of developing games therefore making it an even worse move to not include the community more in the development.If I'd have to rate the game right now, I'd give it a 4/10, with the potential for a 8/10 or 9/10, though it's unlikely that the game is ever going to progress to this point.
