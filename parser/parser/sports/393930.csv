Early Access Review
								Another mobile game on steam!  How do companies think they can get away with it? Because a sucker is born everyday.  This is just another pay2win luck based game.In the first 5 minutes you can literally buy a character that will beat every free player in the game. Go #TeamPay!Each time they (mobile companies) release a cancerous ""luck based"" or ""wait for a timer""  game they somehow manage to wipe peoples minds of their past actions. In just a few months another will come out. How will we stop it? We can't. We can use steams review system as a weapon. Download this game, let it idle for 5 minutes, and then give it a thumbs down.Have you been in the Android or iPhone markets? All those games are just itching to take over steam and make steam a filth pool. For whatever reason, people buy them and expect different. A sucker is born everyday, such a true statement. The developers that make games like this are scum, they are directly responsible for the slow downfall of gaming. I would go on more but my ""luck"" ran out and my game crashed before I could pay money to beat everyone that did not pay money...fair!			"

								Feels like a miniclip game - but on steam. :/Requirements:- 0% Skill- 100% Luck- Mouse with one button (Left-click)- Your valuable timeNOTE: The Power of the high cash characters skills are WAY too high. F2P players will have to do A LOT of grinding to earn enough cash to buy those characters...... or simply pay real world $$$ to get them instantly at the beginning of the game and blast the faces of F2P players in a F2P game.Roshambo Arena = Pay2Win all the way!

								A short while back, some wacky japesters released a game on Steam called Rock Paper Scissors Champion, and it was...well, ♥♥♥♥, perhaps not surprisingly. What a stupid concept for a fully-fledged game, eh? At least it was free-to-play, so not 100% insulting.   Now a fresh pack of geniuses have decided to release ANOTHER rock-paper-scissors ""fight"" game, called RoShamBo Arena. And the shocking thing about this one? Er...it's actually not that bad!   Gameplay-wise, it's hard to argue that there's anything ""great"" here. It's mostly luck, maybe a little bit of ""psychology"" in trying to predict your opponent's next move or make your own next move less predictable to them, as well as ""strategising"" about how and when to make use of your valuable perks. But sure, on the whole, it's mostly down to chance.    Aesthetically-speaking, on the other hand, it's quite delightful, with charming graphics and characters, and entertaining music and sound design. Hell, I'd even go so far as to say that it's pretty fun, at least for a while. Hell, it's maybe even the teeniest, tiniest bit addictive. But only slightly.   Is it the ""second coming"" of...anything? Well, it's the second ""free-to-play"" rock-paper-scissors game to try its luck on Steam in the past six months, but apart from that...no, it's not. It's just a trifling piece of entertainment, which you can apparently waste oodles of real-world money on to get the upper hand on the other guy, which I really can't see why anyone would bother doing since I can't see why anyone would bother spending oodles of TIME on it, period.    But it's definitely worth a download and just a teensy-weensy bit of your time, especially if you occasionally crave something a bit semi-mindless and, well, kinda ""easy"", at least on the old brain (though I have managed to beat more than half of my opponents so far, be it by sheer luck or otherwise).   By far the best rock-paper-scissors game I've played on Steam this year. I'll leave it up to the individual to decide how significant a statement that is.Verdict: 7.5/10.UPDATE: Okay, so it's only a handful of days later, and I've now clocked up over seven hours on this game, so perhaps a slight update is in order? So yeah, fair enough...it's not ""slightly"" addictive, it's perhaps a tad more than that. And while I still don't see myself or anyone else getting up, say, HUNDREDS of hours on the ♥♥♥♥ing thing (please, God, NO), I can safely say that it's quite compelling in its own odd way. If you're not above a bit of light-hearted ""fun"", definitely give it a go. Oh, and I suppose I should raise that Verdict slightly in accordance...Updated Verdict: 8/10.			"

								Fun enough in single player ""city"" mode.  but somethign is wrong with the duel match making (pvp).   I've only had about 30 duels but 28 of them the match was so unbalanced it was no fun at all.  At LVL 4 my hp is just under 115.  28 dues the apponent was over 150hp, with drinkable bonuses.   this fees like a pay to win PVP, but the NPC play is fair and fun.    Dont bother with duels unless you bought, or are buying items for the matches.   There is no reason for a unbalanced match for a game of chance.   Until they fix dueling, i'm not particulary interested in continung to play.  Was hoping this would be a quick casual game of chance to jump on and play others with.  No salt, just not a great flavor.			"

								For starters honestly this game doesnt deserve the amount of hate it is getting. Yes its a mobile game but its fun. its rockpaperscissors with abbilties and rpg elements. A lot of people have been saying this is entirly luck based. HELLO! have you even played rockpaper scissors? 80% of that game is luck.That being said even this version of rock paper scissors is not entirly luck based there is stratagy you can use, you can very easily fake out your opponent and trick them in to playing what you want them to (i.e. at the start choose paper twice in a row maybe 3  then switch to rock 80% of the time the ai will swap to scissors) the usual stratagy you can use to win rockpaper scissors in real life can also apply here for the most partoverall this game deserves a lot more praise than its getting7/10			"

								Shortly, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR YOUR MONEY WITH IT.Observation: I got the Starter Fighter for free, so my experience was a easier gameplay, compared to a average guy. Consider it while reading.That was the most cash-based game i ever played. It's not just pay-to-win, it's PAY-TO-PLAY.To begin, the shop is divided in items you can buy with in-game money and items you can buy with cash. You actually can get cash playing, but, of course, in minimal amounts and as i tried, you can't buy everything up to your level without grinding. The few minutes i played was enough to run out of money, both in-game and cash (remember i got the Starter pack?).The gameplay could be a little more interesting if it wasn't luck-based only. And I actually think(not sure) from my experience that your chance of error against the CPU increases as you progress the campaign.As any ""good"" pay-to-win game, you begin with the worst character possible and have to get higher grade characters and very early they become your enemy in the campaign (i just played a few minutes, but already encountered them).For real, you can't play this game without spending money, so DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. There are a lot of better options, even for free.			"

								normaly i have to play a few rounds of pvp in mutliplayer games to get a feel for the game.first match i was paired with somebody of the same level except they were completely decked in p2w gear.no punches thrown, i just leave the match.says i recieve no teeth or exp (i hope he recieved nothing as well)  which is fair i dont expect to be rewarded for NOT wasting my time.second matched with same level opponent,  attempted to tic-tac-toe,  seems my opponent keeps making the exact same choice i make,  but they do ""dirty tricks"" and kill me ???well ok,  im not spending anymore time on this game.i probably wouldnt get so frustrated if it didnt take so long to get a match started and didnt spend so much time inbetween fights.maybe just providing immediates matches against different opponents (DIFFERENT OPPONENTS EACH MATCH) would have aleviated the majority of frustration felt from two negetive back to back experiences.also the tutorial took too long and was too wordy.it was as if it was trying to be funny but never really delivered any wit or humor and was over all too wordy.too many speach bubbles filled with too many words.just explain ""tic tac toe""   and then explain the rest of the game in simple and cogent and precise manner.the tutorial is simply meant for instructions about how to play.by the time i was 1/5th through the tutorial i felt i already knew what to do but i couldnt escape the tediousness of the wall of speach bubbles.   like a fool i read each speach bubble instead of just spamming click to skip - in hopes to find advice or instructions - but it was just a bunch of BLAH BLAH BLAH.need a TLDR button for the tutorial :p			"

								This game is ok for a while. It is meant to be an arcade fighter not a Mortal Kombat. The progression is slow but not so fast that you become OP while making matches fairly ballanced. The mechanics are easy to pick up and the tutorial explains just enough so that its not to long and boring. Overall I think it is a good game as it is free.			"

								basically a-rock-paper-scissor game that uses luck as the main power and items as the secondary power. spamming a mission would be great to increase player's level, but if they're going to do PvP and find a rich player as their opponents (that's basically OP because of the items they bought), they'll be ♥♥♥♥ed up. can't say if this is a nice game or a bad game,well, just give it a shot. gonna add more reviews soon, and possibly a critique. thumbs up for now and good luck for the developer.

								RoShamBo, a Rock, Paper, Scissors game about collecting loot, leveling your character, and recognizing patterns. You can play through the single player city mode, or play against others in the online battle mode. The actual fighting consists of r,p,s along with using your heroes abilities and potions to stay in the fight longer or end it quicker. It looks like there is a large variety of gear to get for your character, but it may require some grinding to get everything you want without paying real money.  Now I for one might think that playing a rock, paper, scissors game is a little silly, but I have to admit the game makes it seem a lot more appealing than it really is. Overall I think its pretty neat.			"

								Wow who would of guessed! Rock, Paper Scissors is based on luck :O Have you imbeciles never played in real life? what ""skills"" do you use in Rock Paper Scissors in real life? if you answered some, just don't breed, save humanity.the items kind of help you to win, either by blocking damage or doing more damage. other than that, there is no active thinking involved or skills. just upgrade attack and defence, and spin the wheel daily, to win teeth or cash. believe it or not, saving these currencies for a good item is a good stratedgy. however, it is still luck based.the pvp takes a few mins to find someone but is fair.

								Interesting approach to a good old ""rock, paper, scissors"". You can have a character with health points, items & some abilities, like block next attack, do an increased damage on next turn, heal yourself and many others. At the start it seems quite fun, but when you go to online, you'll see how donation system works :( Your opponents will have twice as much hp as your character, do a double damage compare to you :( So the only thing to win against them, hope for a luck. A very big chunck of luck :DOverall: p2w, mostly depends on luck. So, personally, I don't see any advantages of putting money into this game. "

								Fun if you want to play some stages in singleplayer or ""city mode"". Other than that though the game is extremely P2W. The stats on the shop items are insane.I managed to reach 268 health because i won 1000 teeth on my 2nd spin and i fought people with 350-450 health on duel mode. Even if they fail the first 5 times they can still beat you after that if you fail 3-4 times.At least the prices are not insane like other mobile type games of its kind as far as i've seen. You can still have some fun even with duel mode or single player and have it run in the background while you play something else.Another negative thing is that its community is ""dead"" so you have to wait in queue for 1-2 minutes maybe , sometimes less , to find an opponent to play. I have 8 wins / 10 defeats so far so not too bad i guess.As someone else said in another review , great for when you are bored.			"

								I'm ashamed that I spent as much time on this game as I did. All you do is fight duels, tournaments and fight in the city. It gets old after awhile.I was trying to throw fights in the Duels in order to get the Loser Gold achievement because I was winning a lot more than I was losing but even though the game counts those as losses, Steam counts them as wins for some reason and I ended up getting the Killer Gold achievement without winning 500 duels in the game, don't know if that's Steam's screw-up or that of the developers but anyway, I was trying to win duels so I could earn that achievement rightfully in the game, but shortly thereafter, I kept getting harassed by one of the admins in duels, I could tell it was an admin because I was fighting the same guy over and over again and it wasn't taking me as long to get into fights.Guess I'm too powerful or they're mad I accidentally exploited one of their glitches, speaking of which, sometimes the game glitched up on me on my computer.Also, the game would crash occasionally when I would do duels or tournaments and the game would count that as a loss, I tried asking about that and never got a response back. And yes, I paid to get more powerful, such bull crap that I had to resort to that in order to have a fighting chance rather than be able to earn it without using real world currency.Bad freemium games make Santa very unhappy, enough to, uh, never mind.
