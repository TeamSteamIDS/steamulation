												Seems like achievements were added just to trick people into buying this product. Played it for 14 mins and got all of them once I closed it. While the game itself doesn't look bad for the time I've spent in it, I don't think this is the right approach - to add hundreds of pointless achievements just so achievement hunters (like myself) buy the game.Can't wait to see the new system that will replace Greenlight (which is so faulty right now, but that's a long story) if that ever happens.

												This game is terrible. I saw a few friends playing it and thought for a dollar it would be worth a go. But no.Although I was intrugued by the nearly 700 achievements, I didn't buy it with the knowledge that you can simply idle this game for the achievements like 90% of the other people out there. I legitimately thought that the achievements were by making progress. They'd throw you an achievement for small little actions or for making progress or something. Even though the achievements don't make a lot of sense, I thought that was the dev's plan to motivate people to play their game.So I played 90 minutes of this ♥♥♥♥. I thought I'd give it a chance... what a waste. The writing is cringeworthy. The battles are no challenge at all. I've been to three different towns and have not once seen a place to buy new equipment. No map. They hand out items and money like candy, taking all difficulty out. The story is poorly implemented. Poorly designed in general. Steam overlay doesn't work, and even trying to tab out using alt+tab doesn't seem to work. Sometimes, it'll also crash on start up. They've tried to mimic the dozens of other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheap RPGMaker games here on Steam, but they fail even at that. Then I realized, ""Wow. Huh. I've played this for 90 minutes and gotten 6 achievements. Friends of mine played this for 20 minutes and have all 600. What gives?"" Try to find answers in the discussions section of Steam, and even the dev doesn't seem to understand what's going on or give a clear answer as to why the hell this game is so busted. The way it's SUPPOSED to work is that it will give you 1 achievement per second of playing. But it seems to work at random for some people, and not for others. HOW DO YOU ♥♥♥♥ UP THIS BAD? Lose lose situation. I wasted a dollar, I wasted 90 minutes of my life, and I had to idle the game for about 5 hours until the achievements unlocked. At least they unlockd, but still. About the only plus side of this was that it has card drops, and by selling my three drops I was able to get most of what I paid for this game back.			"

This game was the tenth game I've reviewed for my ""Steam Redlight"" series, where I review games when they're 'in the red' in reviews to see if it's as garbage as everyone says it is.You can see the review / reaction video here.In summary, I wouldn't buy this game unless you have an undying love for RPG Maker byproducts. The game is not absolutely terrible, but there are far better RPGs to spend your time on. Hunter's Grimm is an old-school RPG, which in my shallow game history is closest to be compared to Final Fantasy 4 in both its good aspects, and bad. You're inevitably going to fight Emperor Behemoth, just because you're wanting to teach him a lesson on how to name himself, because Emperor Behemoth is surely not to be taken seriously.Realistically, Emperor Behemoth kicked a lot of ♥♥♥ back in the day, but when he eventually got beaten, the four Hokage separated his armor in the four corners of their evidently flat world. I'm assuming, somehow, the armor got reunited, and these poor teenagers you'll be dropping in the story as, will have to try and de-throne the Emperor. It's worth nothing that the Sarai and Nicholas' parents both went to the store a year ago for milk and haven't been seen since. Unfortunate.A fun fact, also, is that this game was released back in October of 2013 by a different developer. The publisher and developer acknowledged on the community board that this is an updated re-release featuring new art and some other stuff. You can still find the older version of this game, albeit much more expensive, on some corners of the Internet.Enough of the formal introductions, let's see the good, the bad, and the score.The Good:Graphics: For coming straight out of RPG Maker, almost four years ago this year, the updated character and monster arts are pretty decent. This is including the sprites. However, the title screen is horrendous.Sound: In my Steam Redlight time, I always find games that have either an unfitting sound-track, no sound-track at all, or something that could only be related to drinking bleach, but with your ears. This game is unique in the way that I didn't want to take a sander to my ears after a reasonable period of time.The Bad:Gameplay: If you've played one RPG Maker game, you've played quite a few of them. This game doesn't introduce any cool mechanics or core competencies, and thus the gameplay is bland and uneventful. Not only this, but the game doesn't share certain information. For example. there's a part in the game where to continue, your character has to jump over a river. There's no indication that you know your character can do this, and they haven't done this in the past. You likely wouldn't find this out until you decided to walk around and press the action button on every square pixel in every cardinal direction, leaving a frustrating experience for players.Also, I paid little to no attention to the battles. I have a tendency to grind through each mob that I can see just so I don't risk falling behind, and because of that, all mobs I encountered I eventually found myself browsing my phone while tapping the action button repeatedly. Perhaps my own fault, but there was simply no need for any additional mechanics or attention.Story: RPGs are generally lore-rich adventures, but I found this game's universe to be pretty bland. The characters were intolerable due to upholding their tropes and the story-writer's love to play a joke out until it's dead. I couldn't be arsed to play the game past my initial 3.5 hour time limit I gave myself to decide if I wanted to play it, and because it couldn't keep my interest, I stopped.General: I don't particularly care for achievements, but I was able to get all 695 by leaving my game on for an extra hour after I decided to stop playing. I did it as a test to see if it actually happened, and it did. So if you decide you want to pay $2.00 for 695 achievements, here you go.The Score:For those who are unfamiliar with my channel, my scoring is a little less-than-traditional, but still relatively simple. I rate five categories from 0 to 2; 2 is great, 0 is terrible. The four categories are as below reviews, with the last being a ""Wildcard"" category. This category allows me to grade games based on criteria that some games have that others won't. For example, I wouldn't try and grade this game off how unique and innovative it is.Score: 3/10Graphics: 1/2The character and monster arts along with the sprites are all well done. Unfortunately the environment, shading, and title screen are bland, subpar, and/or just straight up ugly.Sound: 2/2:All music and sound effects I encountered seemed appropriately placed and not insanely obnoxious. Although, any time in one specific level may drive you insane, but that reigns true for most games.Gameplay: 0/2I was able to do some light reading on the Internet while handling these mob fights. It was great, yet I felt only have productive.Enjoyment: 0/2The enjoyment is rated at the lowest because I found myself questioning how long has it been and when I got into the three hour mark I was relieved. I was able to decide without hesitation that I didn't want to continue in this game.Storytelling: 0/2Wildcard Category - The story is there, but it wasn't engaging to me. This could have been overcome by having an interesting cast or crew, but I didn't want to learn anymore about Emperor Behemoth, or about how much Sarai enjoys chocolate milkshakes. I do think it's cool to have a ghost butler, though, but he wants to leave that realm as much as I did.If you like pina coladas and getting caught watching strange YouTube videos, you can start your journey here to the sweet succulent sounds of my voice:

												Hunter's Grimm is a typical RPG Maker game that claims inspiration from a slew of JRPGs that tug at your heartstrings and make you wish for the days where you stayed up late playing Dragon Warrior or Chrono Trigger.The problem is, it is nothing like any of the games it wants to take inspiration from, the sole thing they have in common is the fact that they're old school RPGs. Hunter's Grimm has a lot of problems, but I'll begin by listing the few positives it does have.Unlike a lot of RPG Maker games, the assets feel like they have a different touch to them. Unless it's the actual game interface, it feels like some work was put into either having someone else create the assets, or the dev found non-default assets to make their game. The base story of the game is not a bad story, I enjoyed the ""detective work"" in some quests.The issues with this game lie with it's dialogue, interface, and a few ""oopsies"" that were never ironed out. Your quest begins and it feels fairly obvious where to go. You are not introduced to a world map until you are struggling to find your second quest, which your quest log explains is ""north of your manor"". Since there was no world map before, I figured I would just try to go north outside of the manor, as the quest said. It didn't work, you have to go south, completely out of the manor's map to get onto the world map. On the world map, towns are not marked as FF-esque town sprites, instead you have half-♥♥♥♥♥ sparkles showing you where to go. The sparkles in lieu of sprites are embarrassing in any RPG Maker game, because I know how easy it is to make a world map on there, no clue why the developer didn't take a couple seconds to make the world map aesthetically pleasing.After the second quest line, you are told to go to another town, Omber or something (everything in this game gets forgettable after the first fifteen minutes) - on the way to this town, you are introduced to a mountain maze. The level design is completely shoddy and angered me so much that after I got to Omber, I had to put the game down. It's not that it was hard, it was tediously long, and on the way there was nothing to look at. There was a patch of the maze that was literally nothing but grass, and this part can go on for up to 15-20 minutes if you have trouble navigating the maze. It was poorly developed and probably will reduce you to a ragequitting mess.Oh yeah, there are enemy battles. They are initiated a-la Earthbound style, except the enemies are much slower on here and you can easily ignore them. I fought three enemies in the entire time I played - two quest battles, and the first monster I encountered. The battles are dull, and the sprites don't mash up with what you actually fight, so the ghost you have to fight in a quest turns out to be a headless masquerade villain?? It's just typical, default RPG Maker combat with nothing added in to spice you up.Overall, an okay story and cohesive graphical design (except the fact that your main heroine's portrait looks absolutely nothing like her sprite) doesn't save this game from being a mess in what matters, the gameplay. The towns become forgettable as you begin to realize everything looks and feels the same. As the towns feel the same and battles get boring, you realize you're not playing a Square classic, or even a good RPG Maker indie like labyronia - instead, it feels like you're playing your younger sibling's RPG Maker creation and it loses it's appeal quickly. Sadly, Hunter's Grimm is a predictable, ""Grimm"" experience.			"

												A bland RPG Maker game with 480 resolution? Meh. I played it for an hour or 2 to see if the story or anything would spark my interest. Alas, it did not. Pretty dull and forgettable.  I had given up on it and so I figured I'd at least get the supposed ""easy"" achievements.  As many have stated, you get them just for being in the game - they aren't tied to any actual actions or quests.  So what happens? Nothing.  I play for 2 hours; 0 cheevs.  I idle for an hour before bed just to check it out; 0 cheevs. I left the game running in game, or on the title screen, or start a new game, or paused in the in game menu, or standing in the middle of town . . . . 12 hours later . . . 0 cheevs.  I must be really terrible at this game, because I can't even get the freebie achievements.

												With every achievement, I could feel another part of my soul leaving my body. Each emoji; a curse, a hex on the human soul. Each notification; a sword, not of steel, but of demonic power. It hurts. It hurts so much. But I can never escape my suffering, for I know that this wretched human miscreation has my very being under lock and key. There is no hope for me, but perhaps, there can be for you.Turn back, human. Save yourself, while you still can, while you're still human.
