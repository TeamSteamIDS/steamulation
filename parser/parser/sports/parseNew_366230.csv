												Baseball Stars 2 is a very fun retro baseball game.  I don't believe I played this game back then, but I am very glad the game  is on steam and I have the privilege to play it.  I highly recommend this game to sports game fans and those who play casually.The gameplay is fairly simple, but yet at the same time has depth to it.  When pitching you can change the ball's path and/or increase the speed.  When batting you can move around in the hitters box to best position yourself to hit the ball,  You can also steal bases or prevent the player from stealing a base.  This is just some of the mechanics that you can do in-game, there is more that you can do.One gripe I have is there is no mid/between game saving.  When you enter a game mode you have to play against quite a bit of teams and the matches go on for quite a bit.  If you exit the game, that is it and you have to start all over.  This is a bummer because if you play in short bursts like I do, it can get frustrating because you potentially can't beat the game.  I am hoping some sort of saving will be implemented in the future.From an hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and much more.Overall this is a very fun game, I haven't enjoyed a baseball game in a very long time and this hits the spot.  I hope this review helps.			"

												I have fond memories of this game from my arcade-obsessed childhood, but it just doesn't hold up all these years later. The controls are a pain, the AI is brutal and specifically designed to screw you out of your quarters, and every match is just way too long. You can't save your progress, so it's just about impossible to complete a full campaign. I will say that the game still *looks* awesome to this day. The character sprites are big and have tons of personality. The animations are fluid and muscular; every character, every play, every movement, every little visual insert has this cartoony energy and style that the Neo Geo always showcased so well. I also love how the supposed Korean and Japanese players are just these huge white people who happen to have names like Jae Bok. But these aesthetic elements are really where the appeal of the game ends. If you want to pick this up for nostaglia reasons or just to appreciate the cool graphics, I can certainly understand that...but for everyone else, you're most likely going to find Baseball Stars 2 really outdated, hard to control, and a frustrating slog that just isn't all that fun to actually play.

												Great little baseball game. But before buying be prepared to RAGE, cause game as arcade game was ment to take your coins. So winning in succesion isn't easy, well only if you spend your childhood playing it. But for me as huge baseball fan that never played this before it takes a lot out of me. It will stress you to the point of losing your mind, but that sweet WIN makes up for it every single time. The biggest issue i have with it is NO SAVE option. And every game can take lot of time, 30-50 minutes deppending if there are extra innings. So playing 15 games league is almost impossible, except maybe pause idling it. But that is a big minus that you would have to do something like that just to be able to finish whole league. So every time you go out of the game you have to play from the start. Becasuse after every game you get option to select new and better player, making changes in your lineup, making you better as a team and giving the game replay value, But because there is no save option that is somewhat tedious to do. As far as gameplay go, you have one button to hit and one to pitch. While pitching you can use D-pad on controller to select pitches from sinker, fastball to curve. And you have to switch between them cause AI isnt easy to fool. Fielding is kinda problematic and hard to do, specially for a newcomer to a game as me. It takes LOT of games to get the feel where ball will drop leading to lot of losses just beacuse of that. I would recommend this game for any baseball fan, but to someone who isn't a fan it's really hard to. Game is hard to get into and for someone who doesn't know the rules impossible to have any fun. Therefore it's easy to give up and miss all good parts of it. Only gripe i have regarding gameplay is that players will automatically move to next base even if play is an easy fly out. So for instance when you have full bases and no outs, an easy fly out can lead to easy double or triple play for AI. Making it unfair becasue you just can't retreat your players in time.			"

												The port is great and the game feels good, but the lack of saving your progress kill this game, since is nearly impossible to finish it all in one sitting. The original neo geo game had a memory card option, so there is not excuse to not include it here			"

												Baseball Stars 2 is the fun, arcade-style sports game you remember playing on the Big Red Neo Geo uprights. It features lots of well-designed characters, cool cut scenes, and over-the-top announcing. Still, it lacks online play and a way to save your progress as you make your way through season mnode. It's a really fun game with two players!			"

												A good poriton of this review will be singing the praises of the port of this game, more so than the game itself.Baseball Stars 2 is a solid, albeit basic, 16-bit baseball game.This version, however, is unique as it is more than a simple rom/emulator combo. The devs have taken the time to build a custom front-end menu. More importantly, they've actually changed the nature of the timer in the game.Normally, you will see the timer counting down. As this was originally an arcade game, you only had 3 and a half-minutes of gametime. At which piont you would need to add another quarter. This behavior carried over to the home verson on the Neo Geo AES system.With this port, thee timer starts at 0:00 and counts up. Maybe a minor rom hack, but a significant one that makes this the best possible version of the game. This minor tweak converts a game that was designed  to eat quarters and turn around players quickly, into a more relaxed home experieence.Utlimatelly, while I like the effort  of the remade menu, I don't feel it's necessary, but the tweak to the timer is invaluable and really brings the game in line with what you'd expect from a console game.The value proposition of spending $3-$10 for this game (regularly available in bundles and sales) is a personal call. Having lived through the days of the $200 Neo Geo games (not the console, but the actual game itself. One  cartridge. And they couild cost over $1,000. Not adjusted for inflation), I find value in picking it up at one of the lower price points.			"

Product received for free
												Game sometimes runs slower than the original one, menu was redesigned and lost all its feel to the original one. Now Neo Geo X seems the only legal choice to play this title like the old times.			"

												Classic 1980's style baseball. I thought it was corny when they first released on NES, definitely not for those who like the authenticity of MLB The Show or that of the 2K baseball series. We need another baseball game for PC, one that is worthy of being called an action sim. I can never purchase a stat crunching game, I like action, but autheentic action.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - BASEBALL STARS 2 

			Views: 13		

			While this BASEBALL game has a few years on it, that doesn't prevent it from being a great arcade sports game where that involves bases, bats and balls.		

While this BASEBALL game has a few years on it, that doesn't prevent it from being a great arcade sports game where that involves bases, bats and balls.  As with any BASEBALL game, pitching is way less fun than batting but that's a problem with the sport in general.The attention to detail still shines strong with loads of minor animation details and great cutaway shots to highlight action.  There is some input slippage while playing with an analog stick that will take some time to adjust to.			"
