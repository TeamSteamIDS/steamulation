												well the game has near next to no content, pick a sponsor, do pit stops by moving mechanics by clicking, get money to make your mechanics a littlebit better all inorder to help your drive win, that's all there is to the game. I guess the fun is ment to come from getting the lowest time and the UI doen't help with that.In short:   cons:- very repeative gameplay- zero explanation of game mechanics- A graphics slider option with no info about it...- lack of much need infomation, like a map counter......- training mechanics DOESN'T WORK...   pros:- neat idea about being a pitstop crewAbout you might expect from a mobile developer  not really worth £8, £1 maybe for a cheap bit of fun.unlike what there webiste says this will not keep give you ""great fun for weeks""			"

												I cannot recommend this game in its current state. It lacks depth, interesting game mechanics and overall it is just boring to play. The game is buggy and poorly explained, and if you were waiting for a Formula 1 simulation based game you'll need to keep waiting.Review –

Pitstop Challenge is a F1 simulation game based around Pitstops. You join a team, get a crew together and race around the world in 19 locations. The problem is that all these features are poorly implemented. You have no association with the team, your contract states nothing and it is just a lump sum of money in order to progress through the game with. Your crew is bland with zero customisation, you can make certain crew members specialise in certain parts of the pitstop but due to the control scheme it doesn’t really come together. You never get to see areas outside your Pitstop, you can be in Rome, Australia or China, yet the inside of the pitstop never changes.The biggest problems are the controls and what you can control. The only thing you can decide on is what tyres to choose, you can go between different versions of wet and dry tyres. There may be more later on but after nearly 2 hours of gameplay this is all I’m given, first impressions are everything. Maybe an option to not fill up the tank completely, maybe tell the drive to be more aggressive, just something to increase what the game has to offer. The controls are terrible, straight up terrible. Every time you call your car in you have to reallocate your crew members to assigned positions, this takes around 1minute to do, and you’ll do this several times a race, which makes it come monotonous. Why can’t I have pre-assigned positions? Why must I click on my crew member, then the jack, then on the predefined location on the ground? This step should be more automated as the control you have is meaningless anyway. My biggest frustration was during the ‘tutorial’ level. It is done poorly and doesn’t explain how anything works; my first pitstop took over 2minutes as I worked out the buttons that were never explained to me. The game also has bugs, causing my crew to walk around sporadically, refuse to go to their locations or buttons straight up missing. During the tutorial the game told me to ‘click here’, this button had disappeared from the game and not until I relaunched the game was I able to continue. This game is not in a playable state, what we have here is a pitstop game, which is unique, but is bare bones and has obvious flaws that should have been fixed. The only challenge in this game is trying to actually play the damn thing.P.S. It's come to my attention through a YouTube comment that the Shanghai track I pick is actually the Bahrain circuit, apparently this is a common bug/feature as it happens in my let's play/gameplay video also with the Australian track.

+ Multiple Camera Angles, I enjoyed watching the pitcrew work from multiple different camera angles+ Pretty detailed even though you only see one very limited area.- The gameplay itself is extremely boring, literally the only thing you do is click on each crew member and assign them a job in a preset position, and then you must repeat this over and over each time you have a pitstop.- No tutorial, very hard to understand what you are supposed to do.- Missing some features, like where is the guy who adds gas? Or the guy with the hammer who buffs out dents, or replaces damaged bumpers.- Very confusing menues, it's hard to even tell if your car is winning the race or not.---  Alright so i'm not trying to be super negative here, but I could see how a pit crew game ""could-be"" fun. They needed to add ways to watch your driver race, you should be able to choose your driver, build your car, and be encouraged to work fast and come up with a strategy to get your driver to win the race. It should have shown how worn your tires are, how damaged the car is, how much gas your driver has left, and perhaps other info like engine health. At the end of the race you should earn money to repair your car, buy upgrade and more expensive parts. Overall, I just felt like this game was overly confusing, with very basic and ultimately boring gameplay.  I know this is a ""simulator"" and they are mainly meant for educational purposes, but even then I don't see what someone could learn from this.			"

												Good idea , bad game.I think most people would benefit from a good in game tutorial as the game lacks good instruction.Or at least in game hints on what to do as i suspect many will give up on the game due to this missing.After nearly 1hr i had lost interest.To put it bluntly the games terrible.

												Game is way too difficult it does not give you enough time to get your pit crew ready.. the car pulls up for a pit stop and you are still preparing your crew which is extremely difficult.. the pit stop then takes about 2 minutes while the AI pit crews do it in 5-10 seconds.. Game needs to be majorly improved should not have been released like this. im sure if they fixed the problems it would be a fun game or maybe they should have just released it on mobile it would probably be easier to play..
