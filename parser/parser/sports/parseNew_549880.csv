								The game mechanics are very poor. Movement is very clunky and by the time to teleport to the ball it has moved. When you throw the ball there is lag from when you press throw to it actually releasing. This needs alot of work and personally say don't bother with this one.			"

								Not even close to being ready. Lots of lag for me (one second after I threw the ball it would register as being thrown). A bit of micro-juddering on i7-6700K GTX 1080 with reprojection off. *update: micro-judder gone now. AI players are great.			"

								Pretty dang fun, involves some forward thinking (and/or timetravel... but you say the future doesn't exist yet, right?... but yes, it does, so by judging what is most likely to happen in the near future, you are actually travelling through time, which means that all time exists simultaneously, and therefore, everyone lives for all eternity, but now that you know, what will you change?) er, what was I on about... oh yeah, this is really fun :)			"
