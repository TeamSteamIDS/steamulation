								This game is really unique, the premise is straight forward and simple but the gameplay has layers and layers of depth, there is a lot of creative techniques and strategies that can discover. I would say the only thing I would change is the ability to have the controls be up/downleft/right (instead of radial) for predictable control regardless of your position to the center.Great game. Totally worth the money!			"

								A really great fun stylish game for two players! It plays the best with two xBox controllers!! First time I played it was with my friend at Portland Retro Gaming Expo back in 2015 and we were waiting for this release ever since. I can play this game with my buddys for hours. Highly recomend it!			"

												Laser Lasso Ball is a high paced game in which you play aginst either another play or an AI. The game sonsistes of running arround a circular arena in which you and another person are tethered to a post in which a ball of death tavels twards the player. The player must hit the ball back before they are hit, or you will die. Once you or your opponent runs out of lives, they will die. Great time passer!			"

								Had a chance to play this game at EUCON in Eugene, Oregon. Was able to meet the creator and play with him! I got 3 keys for the price of 2! What an awesome guy. :) Great party game! Love the simplicity, fun to pick up and play. Excited for the future of this game. <3			"
