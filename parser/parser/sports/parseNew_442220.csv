Early Access Review
								Key given from developer for review purposes.Well this game sure is something...Don't get me wrong this game is still in earlt access and I have some hope for it but in this stage it's barely playable...Pros: ...-car models-interesting physics (for having fun, not intended)-good idea-nice weaponsCons:-repetitive music-unbeatable AI-no story-bad controls (pointless use of mouse)-zombies can only be run over (tested every weapon)-crashing in enemies only damages you-no servers/players-soooo many bugs-gameplay gets repetitive pretty fastRight now it's 2/10 but keep track of this one cuz it has lots of potential and I belive it can be turned in really good expirience.

Basic InformationTitle:  Iron MadnessDeveloper:  Inane GamesPublisher:  Inane GamesGenre:  Car combatGeneral ImpressionIron Madness is still in Early Access and yet the dev team has taken the wise decision to make the game Free to Play until they can iron out the still present bugs and glitches. It is their first project on Steam and it looks polished enough. It can be quite fun to play in co-op or split screen and it is a homage to already classics of the car combat subgenre. I shall give this game the benefit of doubt since it can still be greatly improved and receive Trading Cards and Achievements in a future update. It deserves them.Strong Points+ Nice 3D graphics.+ Free to Play.+ Potentially fun MP experience.Weak Points- Random bugs and glitches.- No Steam Trading Cards or Achievements.- Boring SP experience.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

								If this gets polished enough it could be the twisted Metal for PC. I do recomend this... In the future.suggested improvmentsSlow down the cars they are too fast to have good battles.Turns are too fast and sharp when moving.Missles and bombs are too powerful or the cars are too weak.Jumps feel too weird being highmore unique looking cars.I'd suggest using Twisted Metal Black as insparation for the controls/feel of movements.I want this game to be awesome so devs please take my suggestings to heart. I can easily become a big fan and play it a lot on my youtube channel.			"

Early Access Review
								3/20/16: So...this is VERY MUCH early access. No doubt about that. What is here is very rough and I would say at least a year of updates will be needed to make it playable for the majority of Steam users. The menus don't make much sense. The content is at a bare minimum. AI is brutish and easily tricked. That said, it feels like the old Twisted Metal games. There is a lot of potential here. For .99 you get what you pay for at this point, but I have high hopes for this one. Also, ""Missle Uzi"" is the best name for a weapon ever.			"

Early Access Review
								I'd describe this as the Bad Rats of car games. Me and a friend tried it since it's population is even smaller than that of Hiroshima's after August 6th. It runs on the Unity engine and as soon as it begns you are greeted with a menu that looks even more dated than if flash games existed on the PS2. A song that I can only describe as hard rock for transitioning Christians plays, one about rental cars which is fitting given that much like this game, no one would buy it. Getting into actual play, the game is so horribly optimised even though the original pong has better graphics so be prepared to turn each setting down to the lowest. Once you've done that, you're all set to go in and be matched on the same team as the only other player in the lobby in your private game. The stock weapon for your vehicle is pretty terrible, so as an alternative I recommend crashing into destroyable objects in game. These release an ear drum shattering sound equal to what one would hear if they were at the peak of Mount St. Helens when it erupted and is guaranteed to do far more damage to your opponet's very soul than anything the miniguns mounted to your car ever could. The laws of physics do not apply to this game either, as it's perfectly possible to drive up the side of a building and hang on, doing absolutely nothing. Overall I'd give this game a solid Mystery Diners/10, it's all four horsemen packed into one .exe - war, pestilence, famine and death. Prepare your anal cavity, the second coming of Christ is nigh.

Early Access Review
								I have to say, Iron Madness is a pretty interesting game.However:Although I do understand this is an Early Access Game, I think it does need plenty of shaping before I starting playing this game purely for the fun of it.""We want to have the community help us shape the game""- Iron Madness DevelopersI want to start by saying that this is a very cool concept and I think this can become something really cool, but I think there are a few corners that need to be smoothed out in the overall shape of this game.Pros: Cool Car Models Multiple gamemodes/maps Multiple powerups Multiplayer Decent Car Physics Split Screen ModeCons: Music seems repetitive AI Can become very difficult to beat Basic car controls Absolutly NO multiplayer games were available (I looked 4/27/2016) The environments you play in seem dark and not visually appealing Many bugs No storyline After the first 10 min. of gameplay the game becomes boring. The price of this game!!!I bought this game during a 90% discount for $0.49, but without the discount the game costs $4.99 and for the kind of content and gameplay I currently see, $4.99 is extremely overpriced.As harsh as it might seem, I think this game deserves a 1/10 rating - because it is overpriced - but if the price tag would shrink down to ~$1 (until much more content is added) I would give this game a healthy 3/10 because it is obvious to me, and probably anybody else that has played the game, that this game is not worth $5.*I crossed out the things which were not an issue anymore.I will check back later and re-evaluate my review if there are changes because this concept has much, much potential and I would love to see it grow!3/10, has lots of potentialThanks for reading folks :)			"

Early Access Review
								The game thus far is a good start: Motor City Mayhem. I reckon this has the potential to be every murderous driving game since GW's original and completely mental 1984 release ""Battlecars"" (you may have noticed the alternative name in store). The sountrack is bonkers, the controls are classic, the maps are simple and effective-all in a very Early Access Game. For those of you with a good old-fashioned simple-minded attitude towards direct violence, I point out the low cost and potential of this game. For those of you without a sense of humour who just want a cheap game with Steam rewards and suchlike-go away. For anyone witha shred of hope-I suggest that you to look at ""Orion: Prelude"", a giant failure that ended up as a massively popular online game once the moaning clowns were driven from the discussion board by the designers' final release and the fans' support. Get stuck in to this for the price of a third-rate burger and chips or a substandard sandwich that will leave you hungry ten minutes later. It's your choice-a game that may eventually turn into a hilarious killfest for you and your pals when you wish it was 2001 and everything was metal AF, or another night in wondering what happened to the last fifteen years. Gentlemen, start your engines.			"

								Great game, if you like twisted metal then this is your game. Pros:-6 game modes -multiplayer-split screen up to 4 players.-great physicsCons:-Need more work on single player (the devs are working on it) would be interesting to have a story mode.for me it's 7/10 you can have a lot of fun with it in split screen or with friends in multiplayer, grab it before they change the price.

								This Game Is CLEARLY Underappreciated. I Mean, From The AMAZING MAIN MENU SCREEN To The MLG 360 Turns When You Tap The A Or D Buttons. Theres also the AMAZING SKINNNNNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but really like the PINK CHECKERED PANZER TANK Is Clearly Their BEST Design Thats Clearly NOT A Missing Texture. Then I Love THat You Can Bet Any Amount Of Money And It Doesnt Make A Difference Unless You're Jewish. My Favorite Part Most Of Definently The Main Menu. We Have Picture Of A Blown Up Car On Fire WIth SOme Kind Of Metal Techno Music That I'm Not Quite Sure What It Is But Its Clearly THE BEST MUSIC TO EVER EXIST TOTALLY. I Dont Know What Anyone Could Argue About This Game, It's Just....... Well......... TO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AMAZING AND COULD CLEARLY DEFINENTLY TOTALLY BE A PRETTY DECENT GAME FOR EA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Honestly I Couldnt Reccomend This Game More			"

								It takes the greatest minds to put man on the moon. Yet here we are in 2016, still being blown away by what mankind can create. This embodies an artistic talent and philosophy that surpasses any other interactive piece of media ever created. The blood, sweat and tears poured into this game shows the moment you reach the title screen. From the first godly-rendered frame, you are presented with a life-defining experience that surpasses all of humanity's expectations. In centeries to come when man is dead, we shall not be remembered for putting man on the moon, we shall be remembered for Iron Madness.			"
