								Nothin' But Net is my favorite of the current basketball VR games so far. It needs music, more customization and multiplayer but was still fun. The amount of settings you can change is also nice.			"

Early Access Review
								A great VR experience. I would recommend this. It is still in development but I still love it. The gameplay is so fun. There is multiple modes (and they are probably making more) that you can use. I was playing horse with a robot! This game does not use in-game motion (you teleport around) so people with motion sickness are ok. There is also many settings that can help you. If you have a kid, or are a kid, and you can't put enough power into your shots, you can lower the basket, use power help (which makes your shots stronger), or make yourself a GIANT. I really love this game and can't wait for the full release when it isn't early access. Worth my time, worth my money.			"
