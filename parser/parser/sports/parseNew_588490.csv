SPOILER: IT'S TERRIBADThis is just the GOG version of the game, with NO improvements to many of the bugs and issues that plagued that game.... in fact it seems WORSE!  Check my initial reaction from this game in my first impressions...


YouTube™ Video: TrickStyle - Steam Version: First Impressions 

			Views: 642		

			TrickStyle on Steam - ""Grab your hoverboard and take to the skies in the futuristic super-speed air racing of TrickStyle.		

Pros: It is the Actual Game TrickStyle and the game itself is AWESOME!  ....BUTCons: Resolution options are Zero and stuck at LOW RES. Controls have to be mapped and do not work out of the gameplayitself SLIGHTLY fixed in Update Limited Options for control layouts (D-Pad?) No sound and could not be bothered to even find out why? Sound now added, however buggy at best.  No effort to bind controller, KB needed for menus Controls STILL very buggy. Widescreen option seems to make zero dif when applied. (Watch Video)Summary form first Impressions:The game is a LAZY port from the GOG versuion to Steam.  No effort has been made and you would be better off purchasing it from there as it has less issues as its a standalone game.  No effort to make ANY fixes to that version have been made.  It looks very dated now due to very dated resolution.  Controls are a pain due to the port to PC. And sound... I couldnt be bothered to try and fix.At this time, you would be better purchasing the Original Dreamcast Game and then Emulating it through the PCs.  Then you have the options of Resolution through the emulator and controls setup for Pads as standard.UPDATE SINCE RELEASE PATCHA token effort has been made to update the game after they realised people would not stand for a re release of the GOG version.  Developers taking down reviews and comments, dubious reviews made by low standing accounts?  In the deffence of the update, I noticed I could now use UP and DOWN in the menus and I now have SFX in game (Still no music?).  I still stand by everything stated above and you are btter off emulating this classic game.... better quality and standard of build.Maybe soon updates will improve the compatbilty and true reviews will start to surface :DTERRIBAD!However.... the Original game IS AWESOME!!

												I absolutely love this game, never owned the original Dreamcast game but I'm glad I could pick up this classic game today. It has everything that made games from the late 90's and early 2000's amazing: - Amazing OST, - Fun and Simple gameplay, - Stylish setting and artstyle and many characters to choose from. Also a 2P mode that seems to be 1P mode but with another player (haven't tested it yet) but that is amazing and I wish more games did this.Summary: Amazing game if you're into classic games, racers, futuristic games pick it up. =) I am glad that I did atleast.
