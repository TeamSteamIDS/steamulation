												given that this game requires a controller, i feel it's sorta important for me to warn players with xbox one controllers that this game currently doesn't work with them.  you can navigate the menus and such and pause the game, etc just fine, but the analogue sticks do not function.  that said, it works perfectly well with the 360 and steam controller. (i preferred the steam controller, personally the right touch pad work fantastic for direction changes, dives, etc)it's very arcadey and pays no mind to things like collective, cyclic, etc. so don't go into this expecting rc or sim like controls of your helicopter. the controls are nice and responsive, however, which is good given the nature if the game, which has you flying through increasingly cramped and obstacle filled courses, trying to hit all the checkpoints and goals as fast as possible.simple, straight forward and fun.graphics are simple but very workable, and have a very tronesque vibe.  i dig it.

												This is a nice, responsive, fun physics based copter-game. It's not overloaded with storylines (almost casual), and it keeps track of your progress so you don't have to keep starting levels over when you mess up. Interesting obstacles that gradually get harder. Plays well on an internal Intel HD Graphics 4600, and has a really cool tron-like look to it.			"

												Game is fun to play (single player). I wish I had more friends to play local multiplayer mode. It works well with my Logitech F310 gamepad. I hope they add an online multiplayer mode soon. Is there a way to remove the ! buttons?			"
