tl;dr -> I wasn't sure how in-depth the gameplay would be. I let the AI play for the first quarter (USA {me} vs. Venezuela), I took over, and I won by 5 points. 11/10 most stressful basketball memory ever.I received a review copy of this game and was excited to try it because I love in-depth sports management games. I was surprised and a bit overwhelmed by how extensive and deep Pro Basketball Manager 2016 turned out to be, but was also still very pleased with my gameplay experience. My best friend (basketball buff) helped me understand many of the mechanics, and we played through a very stressful game against Venezuela and nearly lost (with our USA dream team, mind you).If you like intricate sports (specifically basketball) management, then you must give this title a try. Be advised, there is a horde of content within, and it can be easy to get lost in it if you are not patient.The aesthetics are good – even though much of the game is text- and data-based (many graphs), the layout is very clean and easy to navigate through (and trust me, there are many screens you’ll be looking at). During games, you can watch in 2D or 3D mode – 2D offering a more tactical look and 3D giving you a nice change from the heavy text. I was impressed with the variety of great music in the game’s library – I actually thought it was my own music playing. There is a mixture of chill tracks and more upbeat, exciting ones too. You will be forging your own legacy (hopefully), so the game is very open to differing playthroughs. When you start, you may pick any available team in the world, and can pick up a second one as well (although the artificial intelligence (AI) will coach your secondary team for you if you wish to focus on your main – I strongly suggest that you concentrate on one team at a time).You’ll be using the mouse to navigate through the game, so the controls are simple, however, the amount of different elements to understand and consider are enormous. There are tooltips always available, and the game can be quite overwhelming if you have no experience with management games – especially sports-based ones. You can have your assistant coaches select things for you if you ever need help – for example, starting line-ups, positioning, allocated play time, et cetera. The learning curve is moderate to extreme depending on your experience with management games, and the most difficult element is probably balancing all your responsibilities. The AI will play decently if you choose to simulate games, but if you want the best (and most stressful) experience, then you will want to play every game – or at least every critical game for your team(s).Gameplay consists of you managing every possible aspect of your team(s) – you begin by creating avatar then move on to selecting a team in the world to represent. My best friend and I found it nice (and hilarious) that the player roster is very close to real-life (ex: Kobe “Bryent” and LeBron “Jamas”). Even head coaches had similar names to their real-life counterparts. I selected Los Angeles and assembled my national (USA) dream team, also picking up a Brazilian secondary amateur team. Next, you will be planning player budget and scouting – in order to do things like recruit and rehabilitate, you will need to invest in better staff (sports therapists, trainers, etc). You can even select how much seat tickets in your local arena will cost, as well as concession and memorabilia prices.Training is very in-depth and you will be selecting how much time in a day (as well as before and day-of matches) to spend on team/individual practice. Furthermore, you can personalize training for each player, having one individual focus on 3-pointers and another focus on defensive play. Your training regime will directly impact your performance during games, and you will probably find yourself switching up your strategy often – until you become more comfortable with the gameplay.During game days, you can simulate your own, but I recommend you play through an entire session at least once for the full experience. There is text-only play-by-play commentary, and you can offer general strategies in-match. If you want to go deeper, you can even manipulate defensive/offensive strategies live – and doing this will give you the best performance. That being said, my best friend and I nearly lost against Venezuela because we simply watched the AI for the first quarter. If you want to play zone man-to-man, you can do so; if you want to suddenly isolate while on offence, that’s an option too. Double-teaming your highest-scoring opponent may work, and you can expect the AI to do the same to you. You’ll also have to be aware of substitutions, as your players’ morale and fatigue will fluctuate. During intermissions, you can give motivational feedback to your team, and their morale will be affected depending on your choice (ex: “we are only losing by a few points,” when it’s the last quarter and your team has been working hard may have mixed reception on individual morale). If you choose to play at least some of your games, you will be able to play Pro Basketball Manager 2016 for the rest of your life (or at least until the next installment comes out). Trust me, nothing beats live coaching, and your stress levels will reach a new high.Overall, the game is amazing in terms of depth, albeit a bit overwhelming at times. If you enjoy the intricacy of managing and coaching your own basketball team, then you must definitely give this title a try.I recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												You know, I seen all the bad reviews and all the good reviews, so I said to myself ""I'm going to try it out for myself."" So here I am 14 hours later after playing non stop and I must say, I actually like it. Now I'm not going to say it's game of the year worthy and the names really bother me (Korean names being American names) but if you can get pass that and a few buggy features here and there this game is rather enjoyable.I seen a lot saying the game crashes all the time but I have not had it crash once on me. Do I think the game is worth 19.99 ??? No. I think it needs a lot more work to be worth that. However I'm not taking away the fact that this is an awesome game. I've been playing and it takes some time to get used to everything but I really feel that if the developers stick to updating the game and listening to feedback this game will be even better and soon worth the $20 they ask for it. 8.5/10 is would I give this game and I shall be playing this game a hell of a lot more because it is really fun and addicting. NOTE: This game is more in an early access point as I'm writing this so if you aren't into a fully polished, worth maybe 10 buck game then I wouldn't get it just yet. The game has a lot of potential and I'll be sticking with it every step of the way. I do recommend only if you want to play a game that's slightly buggy and needs more tuning.			"

												I have played past releases of this game and they were terrible for NBA fan and more suited to Euro comp.  But this is a huge step in right direction.  It is not the most stable game and has a habit of crashing.  And is not perfect, would like more options to set overall team strategies, instruct players to avoid fouls (ai seems to adjust this even when you're coaching), no way to guage interest in trades or put players on the block, and player tactics does not allow you to save them.But it is clear that the team behind this a serious about making this a good product and even if it is a few years down the track I will continue to support because it is the only good basketball management game out and year on year it gets better.

												As an avid fan of manager games and having sunk several hundreds of hours into FM, I was excited to see this game released. I skipped the 2015 edition of this game and hoped that 2016 would be a better game. So far, this game has not met my expecations.The game is clunky, UI is messy, and the 3D engine is quite disastrous. Everything runs a couple seconds late, the animations are bad at best, and the game does not come with the right tools for you to make on the fly decisions as a ""basketball manager.""That isn't to say this game does not have potential. The foundation has been laid for what could be a great game, but the devs will need to expand upon it to optimze the game performance and reduce the crashes. If they can do that, I would have happy to change my review to a recommend, but at this point, I simply cannot recommend this to anyone, even if you are a fan of simulation series/basketball.			"

												TLDR; I love basketball and manager games, this one is so bad that I'd rather keep playing football/soccer managers or really do anything else than deal with this rather Early access product.I really want to like this game. I really do. So much that I ignored the ""mixed"" reviews. I love sports management simulations and would love to have a good basketball one.This one isn't it, sadly. It seems rushed and half done, more like an early access title. It is:- crashes constantly (~ 1 crash per hour for me, hope you saved!)- absolutely lacking documentation, the ""manual"" is a joke, couldn't even find what skills influence exactly what- riddled with bugs (for example you can hire the same scout twice, he will show up twice, salary deducted twice, but he can only ever be on one mission)- lots of unpolishedness that with tiem drives you crazy (select sorting, go to player page, go back, sorting gone :( )- missing features (or things I can't find in the game or the manual) - hey you are scouting this player, oh you realized after an update he is not for you - there is NO WAY (that I can find) to abort scouting that player so hey continue wasting resources on them- Game gets ridicoulosly slow at times, e.g. if I played a game, simulated till end and afterwards want to simulate the schedule. At one time it just stopped after minutes. An no I haven't selected too many leagues, restart and reload the game and everything happens in seconds again (some sort of leak I guess)That are just a few of the things. You can also find a ""<BR>"" text in a fairly prominent text (HTML for line break, seems to have not been correctly converted). This hints to the amount of quality assurance this apparently went through.Stay away.			"

												Entertaining and deep simulation with a few quirks in a short time playing. Biggest issue so far is adjusting to odd English translations for game actions. ""The referees take (player x)"" is a common penalty call, for instance. Other than that localization issue, the gameplay is clearly deep, with both pro and college teams, male and female, and the ability to manage do what degree you choose. There's the ability to design your own plays, run specific ones, or just say ""Hey, PG, shoot a 3 this time."" However, just like coaches have to deal with, the players won't always react how you want. There's morale, injuries, and all of the typical details you'd expect in such a sim. Only a bit into it so far (with one come-from-behind 16 point turn around by Michigan State over Kansas), but it's there's quite a bit here to get into. Time will tell how it stands up.Now, I present to you the end of my review and the beginning of my personal musical's hit number, ""Bork!""*curtain rises*Bork! Mmmm bork bork bork!  Mmmmm bork! BORK BORK bork bork BORK BORK mmmmm BORK!*curtain lowers to thunderous applause*			"

												Pro Basketball Manager 2016 is really a good evolution in the serie. Really good looking if I compare it to the previous episodes. The charts are nice, the faces of the players, and this dynamic world map too ! The game also brings us some fresh new features, such as an evolved training and scout system, some nice ways to manage your team, your contracts, your structures, and of course your matches. The player base is also much more complete. I can feel that the team put a lot of efforts and dedication to make the game even better, and I wish people will enjoy it as much as I do. Great job, Umix and Cyanide !			"

												As someone who loves basketball i gotta say this game is awful there are no positives and some in excusable cons. Im 100% sure that the NBA is the most used league and its impossible to play in it. 1. there is no way to see your record or the standings around the league 2. this is the worst part of the game when you coach in the NBA there is no free agency at all or there is no list of free agents and all the big name players resign with there original team so you have to build your team throught the draft and thats it			"

												This game has potential. It has times where it is fun and an enjoyable challenge but those are too few for me to recommend this game. The devil is in the details they say and the details is what kills this game (besides the repeated crashes and bad game engine). Let me give some examples...The satisfaction of fans and the directors is ridiculously maddening with its nonsense. Fan satisfaction is changed by either win/loss streaks of 5+ games or winning/losing by 15+ points. So if you win 5 straight games then lose 4 straight games and rinse and repeat the fans will be more pleased by this than if you take a bad team and win 4 games and lose 1 (but not getting you that 5 game win streak) and get a much better record at the end of the season. The directors are even worse. They will usually give you a goal at the start of a season and there have been times where I have far exceeded the goal and won playoffs series and even won a title with an awful team (example: I just beat the Cavaliers who had three 5 star players with a mediocre 76ers team in an epic series and I got fired after the series halfway through the playoffs. No organization would fire a coach midplayoffs especially one that just had a massive David vs Goliath victory).Another example of the details killing this gme is when my star NBA player on my team would miss 3 out of every 4 layups on a fast break. This is just so unrealistic that it hurts to watch. These are the best players in the world doing the most basic basketball move and just clunking it. How? How is this possible? How do Blake Griffin and Lebron James not know how to do something that a JV benchwarmer who spends the entire season polishing the pine with his bottom can with regularity.Many people have gone into how bad the game engine is and how often the game crashes (I just stopped playing the games at one point and simmed the seasons because I was sick of it crashing) so I will not go into that part.I wish I could give this game a more favorable review and be ready for this game to make you want to tear your hair out if you purchase it. Hopefully the makers will take lessons from this and improve on it.			"

												I have to agree the bad reviews might have been written too fast. The game is a very good basketball management game. It's a finished product and is updated frequently by the Devs. The Devs are also very active on the main game forum, taking suggestions and helping people out with issues - nice to see!The price is great for what you get, and the option to buy the US only version which excludes all leagues minus the NBA + NCAA is GREAT! This means if you only want to play NBA buy the US Edition for half the price.The game has a lot of potential. Yes some of the UI needs fixing as finding some options takes a few clicks but it's all being noted down on their forum follwing player feedback.If you are looking for a good and very in depth basketball sim then don't be worried to purchase this game.

												I was hopeful, but it just isn't worthwhile.  I hadn't played any of the previous iterations, but this feels like an early alpha product without many features implemented.  Those that are implemented are poorly conceived.  I have been waiting for a good basketball management sim for a long time, which is why I was willing to give this one a shot despite the combination of price and user reviews.  Though my expectations were quite low, this product fell far short of meeting them.My only interest in the game at this point would be to serve in the development process, in hopes that it will evolve into a quality product in the future.

												For anyone enjoys fantasy sports like I do, this is the perfect game for you along with all the other sport management games. This one is specifically for basketball, and that's all it needs to be.Everything about this game is to fulfill the needs of a sports nerd. Control every little aspect of your team and make the perfect team to win big or slip by underneath realizing your own mistakes. Keep in mind that I'm also a little weird. I like rubbing my face on every minute detail there possible could be about management. This game lets you control your players, training, and even stuff at the venue like ticket prices and drinks. To me, that's really neato. If you're a fan of these type of games; then, jump straight on it and involve yourself into hours of number crunching fun.			"

												Hey folks, did you like Basketball Pro Manager 2015?! No? Yeah, me neither.Well, good news! It's back - with a slight rearrangement of the words in the title, anyway - and this time, it's got shooting fouls!Pros:1) English translation of French terms will keep you on your toes, regardless of your basketball knowledge. Your starting PG just got the master key? Hey, good for him.2) You will become intimately familiar with the various menus and submenus as you try and track down the location of fundamental components like statistical leaders and free agents.3) Worried that your team is lacking firepower on the perimeter? Never mind, that 6/20 rated three point shooting SF has got you covered - 60% on the year on just under 1 attempt a game.4) Worried that those teeny little guards aren't going to help out on the glass? Don't be! With the rigidly scripted 3Dish engine, your guards have as much chance of being in a rebounding position as I do of firing this title up again.5) Did I mention shooting fouls?!Cons:1) My lack of familiarity with professional basketball coaching probably had something to do with my 4/20 rated 3pt shooting starting forward firing up 5.5 3pt attempts per game  on a .008 clip for the year.2) My lack of familiarity with Vietnamese culture probably had something to do with me not finding it authentic having Vietnamese prospects with American names.Highly recommended!

												I discovered this game in 2014. At that time, I was happily satisfied with all the details and the fascinating deep gameplay.I am enjoying this year's version. The 3D can still be improved.The player database is incredibly rich and most of the players have their real career stats.You can manage both pro and college team, males and females and choose the degree of details that you want to take care of.For a basketball fan like myself, it's joyful to create my own tactics, plan the moves of my player and make them do what I want, in a certain measure, because some of them won't always obey me so I would have to kick them out then.I also like the club management dimension. Actually, you don't only take care of your players and show them how to play but also your club, its finance, the salaries of the players, the stadium and a lot of other aspects.So, to conclude, the game is incredible in terms of gameplay depth, sometimes too detailed but that's configurable.If you are a fan of basketball and/or management games you should definitely give this game a try.

												AVOID UNLESS TRULY DEDICATED.Worthwhile for hardcore manager fans, dedicated basketball fans, not a product for casual gamer though.Im not a soccer fan, but I truly enjoy playing Football Manager games. If I weren't avid basketball fan I wouldve hated this game.ENGINE: 9/10GFX/UI: 2/10 - as for graphic design even managers nowadays are held to a higher standardsAs most of Cyanide games - full of top-notch ideas, but their execution is ranging from terrible to medicore at best. I always feel like Im getting unfinished, hurried product. Might be just me, but thats the story with Of Orcs and Men, Game of Thrones, Styx and recently Blood Bowl 2. Some of in-game mechanisms (like Blood Bowl online competition system) feel outdated by at least 10 years. Im still hopeful someday theyll release a product that feels complete, cause if they do thats gonna be no doubt game of a year for me. Gotta pay lots more attention to detail to  get there, though.EDIT: It doesn't even sort player stats properly... talk bout attention to detail. (100 FG% is counted as less than 30 FG%) I bet there are countless silly mistakes like this yet to be discovered.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I promise i did. Having played the 2015 version and seeing much potential in it I bought this years hopeful for the best.Well it is not as easy as last years in which I always started a career with a team and I was losing no trophy every year, this years I can say it is impossible to keep your job. All budget income comes from the arena when at the same moment you are losing money to the point you owe to everyone that has laces in his shoes.Then it's that bug thing. Damn that bug thing. I never got to play 2 forking games in the forking row. The new features in the contracts are nice because now I cannot sign KAWHI FORKING LEONARD to Olympiacos for 150,000 a week. I saw that there are jerseys in the 2017 version and I was kinda happy because maybe it will help with the finances.Recruitment. Hmm, recruitment was a thing this year in colleges because well nobody in the forking world wanted to attend THE ARIZONA FORKING WILDCATS. If i had a to makethe choice of whether to attend that school or remain a free agent I would even pay them so they would not change their mind.Another problem is that you can not make your own set plays. It is impossible. Screens do not work and an open shot has the same possibilities to go in as a really good contested shot.I would enjoy the game much more if it didn't crash like a drunk Jason Kidd! GOOD LUCK IN FUTURE INSTALLMENTS			"
