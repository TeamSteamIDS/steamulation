												It's all local multiplayer, but if you ever have friends over you NEED to have Sportsfriends. It is a collection of some of the best local multiplayer games ever created. It's the Orange Box of local multiplayer games.			"

Games are really great, but as a PC user, you can only play 3 out of 4 of them right off the bat. It dwindles to only 2 out of 4 if you have anything less than 4 players.The biggest problem with this is the lack of 3 player support. Its either 2 or 4, and nothing in between. A shame, really.			"

												Sportsfriends has been the subject of significant hype for some time, this pc port is quite welcome.Sportsfriends is by design a local couch multiplayer game. Get a HDMI cable, a tv and some controllers to get the most enjoyment out of it. The modes are 1v1 and 2v2, so it doesnt support odd numbers of players.Sportsfriends offers a suit of games - all of which would be worth buying in their own right.BaraBariBall is a volleyball/platform fighter hybrid. You score points by having the ball sink in the water on your color coded side of the screen. Points are lost when you yourself die. Your fighters can ahve a maximum of 7 spirit balls floating around them, which quickly regenerate when on the ground. One ball is consumed with each jump, and they can also be used for power throws or power attacks.Super pole riders has a ball on a rope with two goals at either end. Each player is given a pole vaulting pole - the pole can be used to hit the ball slightly, propel yourself for a powerfull kick, block other players from moving, or jumping on their heads to kill them (they respawn shortly afterwards). This game is crazy fun and often when under pressure you may spin the joystick in the wrong direction, propelling you the wrong way.Hokra is the weaker of the gamess. It is essentially a hokey game that has been done many times before.Johann Sebastian Joust is not available on the PC so I am unable to provide comments.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM "

												The core tenet of Sportfriends: the more people, the better.This is the ultimate party game. Each game has very little learning overhead, is fun to watch, and is over quickly enough that your other friends can rotate in.And yes, the killer app here is Joust. If you love throwing parties, and are friends with people who aren't as into games as you, I can 100% recommend from experience navigating over to eBay, taking the plunge and buying 8 Move controllers. It cost me about $100, but make the next two parties you throw BYOB and you'll be back in the black with leftover booze.There is, however, ONE MAJOR ISSUE: no Windows support for Move controllers! As a Kickstarter backer I've been following development, and it looks the devs have been doing literally everything in their power to get this to work, but no dice – they even spoke to an MS engineer who told them it was impossible to do. Still, if you're going to put in the effort to get those Move controllers, might as well go the extra mile and install Ubuntu on your machine. Problem solved!Also, the other games all work wirelessly with up to four PS4 controllers! I haven't tried any other controllers, but I can definitely confirm Dualshock 4 functionality.			"

												An amazing collection of local multiplayer games. I've been playing these games with friends and at public events for over a year and they're a crowd favourite every time. Each of the games is easy enough to pick up from watching a match or two but are deceptively complex and very competitive. JS Joust has some unusual requirements in order to play (2-7 PS Move controllers and a large-ish room to play in), but the effort is definately worth it. Joust is the most memorable and universally enjoyable party game I've ever hosted.  Even the two secret games are hilarious fun once you figure out how to unlock them (you'll have to figure this one out by yourself).			"

												I absolutely loved this game when I got it on the PS3. When I found out that it was coming out for Steam, I didn't know if it would support Linux or if JS Joust would be supported, since it relies on the PS Move controllers. To my delight, I can play on Linux all I like, and it is in fact one of the superior versions, since Windows' bluetooth support prevent JS Joust from working (they tried, bless them) on that platform.Don't get me wrong, though, the game is worth buying for most of these games, Joust just happens to be the most physical, and therefore, the most novel in the collection of local multiplayer games.

												Through rigorous study and experimentation, a group of friends and I have confirmed that Sportsfriends is statistically MUCH more fun than the following:Farting into coffee cans and then releasing them into the wild, Sliding down stairs on couch cushions, Eating baby-back spare ribs, Shredding the ""gnar,"" Pooping for sport, Pooping for recreation, Consuming Doritos and Surge whilst playing THPS, Getting jiggy with ""it,"" Pooping for recreational sport, Getting some of your chocolate in my peanut butter, Organized professional baby wrestling,and betting on celebrity overdoses.More studies will be conducted now that the full game is out. Sources and data can be provided upon formal request. Except the baby wrestling data. The cops took those, along with our little tiny wrestling ring. "

												Super Pole Riders! My god, that's hilarious! I randomly bought this game when visiting a friend and we were looking for a local co-op game to play on the TV, and by far Super Pole Riders is instantly fun, no one who I made try this didn't break down laughing during this, it's just fun!But definitely get some controllers! and I really wish this had more games on the same level as SPR.

												Srsly, BaraBariball is yet a classic. Its one of the 3 games that are offered by ""Sportsfriends"" and is a mix of a Brawler, with simple controls and goal-mechanic like volleyball. Me and my friends loved it, we began organising 4-player-coop evenings for playing it. Loads of fun if you are into simple controls, but hard to master mechanics.			"

												For a local multiplayer game, this tops the charts as one of my top faves. I am running on windows, so I can't play the JSJ game, but I can still play Pole Riders and BBB, which are always intense fun.  My suggestion though; the more players you have, the better time you're going to have. Even having a third person who is on rotation with whoever loses to encourage someone or shout with the rest of you is enough in my book!It's also pretty damn good at parties.			"

												I don't understand the hype. This pack contains 4 (3 if you're on a PC) games for 2 or 4 players on the same computer. Each game is extremely simple and enjoyable for maybe 3 or 4 tries. Then it becomes boring. I enjoy party games that I can play with friends on the same computer (like hidden in plain sight or the various Mario Parties), but this game simply offers too little. You could probably find better flash games with local mutliplayer than this game. It isn't worth playing and definitely not buying.			"

												There should be a disclaimer for people purchasing this on PC. It should be written at that top that this will not work with just a keyboard.

(Recorded as part of my Extra-Life 2016 charity stream)Grab a group of friends and get out onto the sports field because 'Sportsfriends' is one heck of a good time involving semi sports related activities.Meater than minigames the offerings here will reward skill as much as luck whether it's justing with polvaule sticks or mid-air multi jumping ball handling.With these games coming from a diverse group of developers, they do suffer some from the lack of a cohesive theme, which will often make personal taste and preference decide which get played.

												I have only gotten a chance to play the Super Pole Rider gamemode but throughly enjoyed what it had to offer. The style of gameplay was different than any other game I played and offered an enjoyable experience. From bashing your friends in the head with a pole, to kicking them off the side of the map, Sportsfriends offers fast paced vs gameplay. I will be revisiting this game with my friends soon.If you are interested in seeing more gameplay check out this video.
