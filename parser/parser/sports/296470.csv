My teacher told me I'd never amount to anything. So I mounted my friends.

Well just look at me now. "

												Basically you just di<k around trying to erect a man mountain while waiting for someone to co<k up. I'm not being hard-on the game when I say it isn't very s<hlong and doesn't contain a massive load of game modes or a penetrating plot, because overall it's a nice package. It's not expensive, so you won't feel shafted blowing your wad and your wallet will retain it's bulge. For me it's a definite wiener!...pen|s			"

												Men touching men. Swinging ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Low gravity mode. This game has everything! Pros: - It's funny, challenging, and a great game to mess around in with some friends.- Various game modes.- It's cheap.- You can put yourself in the damn game! Heads and bodies are customizable. Tired of dudes? Makes yourself a sexy woman. Sure, she'll still have a huge dong flopping between her legs, but I won't judge you.Cons:- It will get repetitive after you play for a while.- Gameplay is limited to what you can by just moving limbs.I also feel I should address a comment I saw in the community discussions about this game:""what the hell is this?? some group of gay shlong dingling donging around while they're nakedly trying to stack up on each other? hell no this is gross""^ That is why you should buy this game.

												...I just spent almost 2 hours in an online match with some random guy.  Neither of us were trying to win the game (bridge builder).  We were pretty much on par with one another skill-wise in the beginning.  Suddenly he pulls a fancy move and teabags my character, grabbing his head and smacking his junk against his face.  It was hysterical. I did the same thing right back, attempting to ride his face 'Gangnam style.' This went back and forth from a number of bizarre homo-erotic positions.  The novelty just did not seem to wear off.Thank you, random guy.   Sorry I ended up failing in the end and ruining our teabag-fest. Whether you're good at this game or terrible, it's guaranteed to bring numerous smirks and snickers if low-brow humour tickles your pickle.  The pros+ Hilarious 'QWOP' style ragdoll physics (albeit much easier to control)+ Multiplayer with friends or randoms+ A good variety of game modes and tweaks to keep things fresh for longer+ Likely a game that will be revisted a lot+ Amusing soundtrack and effects+ Lots of customizing options for your teamThe cons- Novelty may have the potential to wear off- Limited casual game, easy to try everything in one sitting9.5/10 -  Would put my dongle in a stranger's face again.

												This game is a tremendously moving social commentary on the current state of Corporate America, and the struggles of the middle-class citizen.  Each mounter represents a member of our capitalist society clambering to be successful and live the American Dream, only to be shoved away and sat upon by another of their fellow citizens.  The goat represents the economic food chain, in which those who are weak are crushed by those who have become mad with power and influence.Or maybe this is a game about ♥♥♥♥♥ physics.10/10			"

												As a heterosexual male this is the most fun I've ever had with swinging ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Disregarding that one time at band camp, of course.In all seriousness, this is a fun little game to play, and even moreso with friends. The controls are pretty straightforward, and the different game modes are fun and keep the game fresh. The added customization aspects are a nice touch too. 10/10 like vertical QWOP with wieners.
