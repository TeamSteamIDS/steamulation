												A surprisingly fun game at a great price point. This is certainly the best chicken-centric VR game out there at this time. Makes me feel like a real chicken. I'm a chicken marge!			"

												Interesting and different. High replay factor. Easy controls and a different concept make all the difference here. Would give it an 8/10.			"

												It's free and it's more fun than I would expect it to be being a game that consists of catching eggs. My main complaint is that some eggs will fall straight through the bottom of the basket.			"

												A nice reflex testing game; wouldn't recomend it as paid game, so good call from the developer. Runs smooth and physics are fine.Only issue I have is later levels that increase the number Chicken shelves (Hmm, can't think of another way to describe that), places them further away where I'm hitting the wall. That's within a 2M SQ play area. That's not a moan but really some dev feedback too look into.			"

												A pretty cheeky little game where you have to get a bunch of eggs into a container. Sounds pretty stupid at first but it's pretty fun especially with the special eggs and abilities. One bad thing though was that in the second level I couldn't get to the container as it was beyond my playspace, but the first level was pretty good.Overall I have to give this 6 barns out of 9, would recommend to HowToBasic again :^)			"

												Good fun to play, and hysterical to watch others play too!A great game to have a laugh with your friends and family.Good - Small download - Runs quickly and very smoothly (GTX1080 and I7-6700K). - A good one to play more than once.Hmmm - Can't seem to view the high scores? Play area just says 'Nick' and 'Score' with no scores. "
