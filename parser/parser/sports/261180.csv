												As a projectile fighting game Lethal Leagues core is simple: hit your opponent with a ball to score and ultimately win a match.You can try a bare bones prototype on reptile games' website to see if you like that concept.Like many other recent small competitive games this one challenges the player with high risk&reward as a single hit from the ball is a knock out. Although if you or your team hit the ball last it won't harm you.The intense fun of this game starts to kick in once you've hit the ball back and forth a few times, ever increasing its speed to ridiculously high levels (speedometer at the bottom on the boombox). Normal hits only increase the ball speed by 1, charged hits and smashes however double the speed. With more speed the hit lag will increase, the screen will shake, the background will change, intense visual effects will ripple across the screen and the characters will throw catchy phrases at each other as they hit the ball. Next to jumping and swinging you can also bunt the ball to slightly decrease the speed and carefuly set up your next attack.The movement mechanics are very solid. You can move right and left as you jump, you can tap for a short hop or hold to jump higher and stay in the air longer as well as press down to fall faster.The selectable characters two major mechanic differences are their method of gaining height (high jump, wall jump, double jump, wall ride, ...) and their special move, which can be activated with a full special bar (builds up by hitting the ball).Next to online and local multiplayer with up to 4 people there is also a single player challenge with 10 increasingly difficult stages to beat in sequence and in local multiplayer there are 7 levels of AI difficulty with the highest one still being a challenge even if you are already very good at the game - although not as engaging as a good human player will probably be.And it's a damn lot of fun.Raced to the top of my most played game ever list during beta testing.

												Honestly a great game that I didn't think I'd stick to for so long, even though 80% of my playtime was spent vs North American Players the community was willing to accept me and tolerate as much of my lag.... as they could (I'm Antarct---- Australian) :D:Great Game 9/10, could use some better palettes and have a tutorial with parryingIf you're willing to treat this as more than a party game, Lethal League has great depth and offers the potential for insane rallies far beyond the scope of ballspeed :D: with a great community to boot (just join the LL h̶u̶b̶c̶h̶a̶t̶ discord https://discord.gg/zSB7ZAe feel free to ask for games or just hangout).

												As a big fan of local multiplayer games, I originally got this thinking it'd be a fun couple hours of casual fighting with a group of friends. While it was certainly that, I never expected to get so deep into (what I deemed as) a ""party game.""The online community is fantastically rich- Just hop in the group chat, and you're bound to find a match with someone of whatever skill you're looking for, or someone to help practice a specific tactic, or just some casual FFA fun. There are tournaments hosted every weekend, and virtually everyone in the community is a blast to talk to.But the game itself has a depth I have never seen before- I have over 100 hours logged of high-skill matches and tournaments, and I am still finding new strategies and mechanics to use. My current repertoire is even missing two mechanics that I know, and with those two, there are plenty of uses I haven't even thought of.The depth is incredible. The community is great. The style is fantastic, and the play is like nothing I've seen before. Buy the game- You won't be disappointed.			"

												This game takes the old school two-button skill games and gives it a flavor like no other. It's like being put in a racquetball room with dodgeball rules. The ball can get to ludicrous speeds! But if there is any lag at all whatsoever, it will be difficult to achieve.There's a baller OST (not many songs though), a nice variety of stages, mostly aesthetic, but still provide a variety in size and significant difference with candyman's special--and a handful of characters with subtle but important differences in their traits. I highly recommend this game as it is online play, amazing with friends and absurdly addicting for such short matches!I hope there will be a way to chat with opponents in the game, at LEAST in the lobby. You can not communicate to them not to start a match because you are waiting for more people or if you want them to ready up for the game. 9/10			"

												The online is incredibly good, which is to be expected from GGPO.  4 player games tend to lag/desync a bit, but as long as you are not playing across countries, it handles it well.  1v1 online is nearly perfect from my viewpoint.Controller support is also good, I have tested 4 different controllers, all of which worked.  Only a few required minimal key binding.Gameplay itself is of the ""simple to pick up, hard to master"" variety.  Great for local party/competitive play.  Its fast paced, and has a lot of ""epic moments"" for all your friends to hype about.Not much content to be honest, though the game is obviously about multiplayer, and they do have a few modifiers to change things up.  But this is an important note, if you don't have good internet/local friends, do not get this game.  Though I doubt anyone reading this falls under this category.I personally like the art style, I have heard a lot of people complain about graphics.  I don't really need to review this though, if it looks ugly in the screenshots, you will find it ugly in game.Boss soundtrack, as in GOOD electronic music, not try hard dubstep.If my review seems badly written, it is because I am not a writer.  But you can trust me on this, Lethal League is amazing for what it is, and is definitly worth the asking price.  Anyone who is shying away because it is ""too simple"", there is a lot of depth/mind games to be had in hitting a ball back and forth(as silly as that sounds).  Is it another Nidhogg?  No.  Another Divekick?  ehhh, maybe, depends on whether you hated Divekick for its gameplay or for other reasons.  To me, this seems like a similar concept to Divekick, though better polished, different gameplay mechanic that is more hype because of its faster/more deep nature, and a better presentation.  This game is definitly better than Divekick, but still holds the similar concept of simple but hard to master.In the end, yes, I do recommend this game.  This game will entertain you and your friends for a long time.If I have not answered your questions/concerns about this game, leave a comment and I will edit the review.""I am terrible at this game.10/10  Would noob rage again.""Edit: Nominated for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.

												Lethal League is a 2D fighting game, but unlike traditional fighting games you don’t use fists or kicks or any kind of combat moves. You pick a character and hit an anti-gravity ball against your opponents to beat them, the ball speeds up and bounces harder off the walls with every hit it takes, reaching unbelievably fast speeds - particularly when one charges the hit. All this makes it hard to avoid the ball and also hard to hit the ball. Each player has a certain amount of lives per round and lose them by getting hit with the ball. Once all your lives run out you’re done, and the round ends when there’s only one player left in the game.Pros: ++++ The game is good fast-paced fun, the latency is very comfortable.+++ The audio and visual aspects are very befitting of each other, especially the effects and art style.+++ Music is awesome, fits perfectly with the battle atmosphere.++++ Hitting the ball feels solid, firm – making for immersive projectile battles.++ Different modes: FFA, TEAM DEATHMATCH+++ Different characters make for different moves/special moves.+++++ ”No weak ♥♥♥♥.”Bittersweet:-/+ Gameplay is easy to learn but hard to get good at, practice makes perfect and provides hours of fun.-/+ Speed cap for the ball is ridiculously high, might as well be infinite which makes for difficult but impressive moments.-/+ Limited player choice, however they are very stylish and have different colour schemes.-/+ Player base has cool people, but it’s not very big.Cons:-Not really anything negative about the game, if I had to name something it would be the lack of characters and small community.Final Opinion:All in all this game is addictive, exhilarating and a massive amount of fun. It’s as if Super Smash Bros, Pong, and whichever traditional 2D fighting game you can think of had a baby. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Art style, music and gameplay go perfectly well together for an amazing fighting experience.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. "

												This game is the perfect example of how you simplify a fighting game to its roots while maintaining all the depth and metagame intact. Lethal League is a 3 button game (Hit, jump, stall/counter) where your goal is to hit your opponent with a ball, the ball builds speed with each hit and you have to be in the proper position to hit it back to your opponent while trying to not get hit by it.There's a limited roster of characters but all of them are very unique, no character plays exactly the same which makes every matchup very fun.This game also has a superb sountrack and an amazing netcode (GGPO) with up to 4 player online multiplayer.This is one of the most fun games i've played in a really long time, however there is a huge con to all of this, the game's asking price is $13.99 USD...Sure, that isn't much, right? it's the price of ""X"" or ""Y"" so it's not a big deal yadda yadda. However the game is truly lacking on the SP content, there's only a mode where you play against the CPU and a pretty barebones ""Challenge mode"" (Arcade mode) so there really isn't much outside of playing it against other people and even thought that's the main point of fighting games there's so many other games (Skullgirls, KOF) that at least cover a bare minimum of a Story Mode and a proper Arcade mode while also having very good tutorials (Skullgirls) and really good challenge modes (KOF Trials) both which have been in multiple sales for less than half the price of this game.The game is virtually dead on arrival, very much like Divekick (Even though Lethal League is incredibly better on every single aspect). It's almost impossible to find an online match because no one really is playing it and the price tag does not help the situation and it's a HUGE shame, because this could've been a smash hit that everyone would be talking about.Bottom line, this is one of the best fighting games you could ever play if you're either a veteran or a beginner, but i can't recommend this to everybody because the current price tag is not really justified, wait for a sale and buy it, maybe then more people will be playing it after they discover how amazing this game is.

												This Game is fantastic, if you have Friends!I played this Game with my Brother and Friends, and we had a lot of Fun for 13 Hours. The Gameplay is very simple. You choose a Character out of six.Every Character has their own ""Ultimate / Special Attack"". For example one Character can eat the Ball and spit it out somewhere else. It's getting really hard, when the Ball reaches a speed out of 10.000+Multiplayer is quite dead, even after Hours of searching. So if you have Friends, go for it!If not... Think for yourself it its worth it. Story Mode is kinda... meh...*RECOMMENDED AFTER ALL*			"

			Episode 48 - Lethally addicting Review by 16-Bit In today's episode we take a look at Lethal League! Make sure to check out written reviews and plenty of other well done reviews and recommended games...		

HISTORYReleased in August 2014 and developed by Team Reptile and based off the flash game prototype bearing the same name, it’s Lethal League!As of this review the game is on version 1.07.12STORY AND WHAT YOU DOIn Lethal League with no real context or story, you play as up to 6 different playable characters who face off against each other in an arena in up 4 players at once, the goal simply being to hit the ball at one another to knock them out.With each consecutive hit to the ball, it gains speed, which can make things very interesting, very fast.The game also has a number of different modes from online, to versus, to an extra menu with different things such as a tutorial, training mode, as well as the challenge mode which basically acts as the core single player aspect to the game itself.THE GOOD-Quick and easy to pick up and play gameplay-Addicting-Different game modes and options to choose from-Competitive and great multiplayerRight off the BAT pun intended, one of the best aspects to Lethal League is the pick up and play nature of the game itself, it’s easy to learn and you’ll be smashing your opponents in no time flat, the game features an easy to learn tutorial to help new comers out, but the concept itself is pretty easy to wrap your head around.It’s also extremely addicting, the first time me and my friends started playing this together we couldn’t stop, the quick matches and nature of the game itself lends to the addiction factor big time and it works beautifully.The gameplay itself is fairly unique, almost reminding of pong on steroids with a gorgeous art style and blazing soundtrack to boast its intensity, the game is easy to play, but definitely takes some serious skill and good timing to master it.But easily the BEST aspect to Lethal League is the online multiplayer, whether you’re in a team or free for all, Lethal League truly shines when you’re pitted against your friends as you battle it out and make the ball reach absolute insane levels of speed.You’ve also got access to a variety of different game options if you’re hosting, from changing the speed of the ball itself when you hit it, to a big ball mode, team versus matches, free for all, and a mode where you basically have to hit the opposing team’s target at each end of the map to gain points.The character roster as well all have their own unique abilities as well to mix things up, and you unlock different skins for them as you progress the game and earn “experience” allowing you to level up and unlock the different skins for them and overall really adds to the addictive nature and replayability of the game.Over all, we had TONS of fun playing this for hours on end and is easily one of the best competitive games I’ve played in recent memory.THE BAD-Few core game modes to choose from (not much content) *Minor*Honestly I don’t have much to talk about here, Lethal League does what it does very well, I had no major issues or never felt something was unfair or over powered and the game is very well balanced. Probably the only issue I have is the lack of content, despite just talking about the different game modes to choose from, Lethal League outside of what I mentioned doesn’t offer much for core game modes.If you’re looking for some beefy single player content, you won’t really find it here, sure you’ve got a versus mode where you can pit yourself against the PC at different difficulty settings, as well as a challenge mode that you can beat with each character to gain some achievements but honestly this felt nowhere near as compelling or interesting as the multiplayer.As for the multiplayer, once you’ve played as each specific character, and played the different maps and fiddled around with the match settings a bit, you’ve pretty much seen everything this game has to offer you.But to be honest, this is all pretty minor and I can easily see myself coming back to play this.THE UGLY-Not graphically impressive, it’s quite literally based off a flash game after all-What it lacks in graphical fidelity it more than makes up for it in art style-Amazing soundtrack-Odd game crash during multiplayerWhere we discuss the graphics, soundtrack, and technical aspect of the game.Lethal League won’t wow you in the sense with amazing textures and particle effects like some games might, which is obvious considering the game looks like something you could find on Newgrounds.But what it will wow you with is the fabulous art style it boasts, from the different scenic backgrounds, to the character models and general presentation, what Lethal League lacks in big budget impressive graphics, it more than makes up for in its amazing art style and presentation.And one thing that really adds to this is the AMAZING soundtrack, this is easily one of the best sound tracks I’ve listened to in a game in a long time, the art style and soundtrack over all give me almost a Jet Set Radio vibe, and I love it.However, not everything is perfect, we did have our fair number of freezing issues during online matches, as well as the odd game crash or two in my 5 or so hours I’ve spent with Lethal League, but overall the gameplay itself was bug free during our experience and most of the crashes and freezing were during the online match making.FINAL THOUGHTSAs I said earlier this is probably the most fun I’ve had yet so far with any indie game and I highly recommend you give Lethal League a try if you’ve got some friends looking for a fun, unique, and competitive game, despite some minor technical issues we had, playing this was an absolute blast.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												10/10 No weak sh*t.Ok let me start talking seriously here, it's you vs a bot or a local friend, or an online person. there's a ball you can hit and by doing so the ball will change to your color and it won't hit/hurt you, on the other hand it will hit and take out your opponent if he/she doesn't hit the ball back at you. Every time you hit the ball it will increase it's speed/velocity, and hitting it in a certain way doubles the speed, so it will become more and more challenging and hard to hit the ball.Also, this deserves a notice of its own, the online playing is amazingly smooth, just fantastic. Hard to notice any lag.Personally, I'm loving the game, and i think it's well worth it, but it's basically match after match playing against 1 to 3 other opponents. there is a ladder challenge single player mode which will get harder and harder the more levels you finish, with some changes like going against a huge boss character, or the ball being huge. That's what's in the game, and if you think that's not enough to make you jump and get the game, then wait for a sale, but if you want to go by my opinion, i think it's well worth it for the fun and challenging experience you will get from it.More info here[www.ksalue.com] "

												SUMMARY: Its like smash and pong on crack. Very fun to play with friends or on local co-op. Gets more and more intense as the round goes on and both parties are screaming their asses off as the balls pierces the fabric of the earthEXPLENATION: Its a fighting game where the player chooses their select character each with its own special ability that is more or less balanced. The object of the game is to hit a small ball back and forth, changing its colour to the player that touched it last, if a player who is not the same colour touches the ball (as in not hit it) they die and lose a life, zero lifes left and the player is eliminated. Now heres the kicker, as the ball gets hit more and more, it gains more and more speed, extreme amounts of speed one could say and the colours of the game starts changing to match the intensity and the speed that the ball is going at. All while a kickass soundtrack plays in the background. Definetly a fun game although I wish more people played online :(			"

												There are many games which have multiplayer mode and only a number of them ends up as global hits which are played by lots of players and in which connection issues are rarity or aren't issues at all. While this game isn't this kind of title yet, I need to say this game is a little gem which should shine really bright in near future. But let's start from the beginning.Lethal League is a game where your main goal is to control ball and hit it as hard as possible to hurt your opponents and knock them down, while also using unique techniques limited to each of playable characters. Sounds simple, right ? But I assure you it's not that easy, especially when the movement with which ball move after few hits may reach RIDICULOUS speed and hitting the ball itself (or counter it by pressing X which is a kind of a block which stops the movement of it) may be a really tough challenge. This game will test your dexterity, reaction time and timing, which are really crucial here. So in other words I would call this title easy to learn (it's literally jump, hit and block buttons), but hard to fully master. Graphics are as simple as in screenshots, but I need to say they are still estethic and look nice with bright colors mixed in (I also like in overall the style game brings with interesting characters). And I need to mention one more thing, which is really, REALLY crucial - music. My gosh, music in this one is one of the best things I heard in gaming history. Electronic climates created by really talented artists like Grillo, zeroSCAR or Klaus Veen fits the climate of the game perfectly, while being perfectly well made. I would say music alone in this game make this game worth to purchase, it's THAT good. To sum it up game is really well made flash-like game with incredible competitive potential. Game basics are simple to learn, but this game has this crucial element, which make it fun, challenging and mostly work like some sort of a drug, which forces you to play it as much as you can. I give it 9,5/10 as I feel 5 characters is kind of a small numbers of possible options if you ask me. But I assure you - this one will become one of the best gaming hits ever. At least it has great potential to become one.			"

												Fast-paced non-traditional fighting game that relies less on player execution and more on getting into the head of your opponent. One of the freshest takes on the genre I've seen in years. Fantastic fun in both 1v1 and 4-player free-for-all.It offered some of the most competitive moments this year, and is easily one of the best games of 2014.			"

												Game is fun!I've seen many call this game ""Smash Brothers meets Pong"" and that's roughly correct. Lethal League is similar to Smash titles in its ease of access (being pretty simple to understand and play) and its competitive depth. Its similar to Pong in being focused around the ball, the one lethal element of the game. You and your opponent(s) are striving to hit this ball, tagging it to yourself and making it lethal to your opponent until they successfully hit it back (or miss, get hit, and die). The ball will steadily speed up after every hit as long as players remain alive, ramping up the intensity. Continue this until all but one player have lost all their lives, and only the champion remains!Local and online multiplayer are supported, with 2-4 players. You can play 1v1, FFA, teams, or strikers (similar to soccer) modes. There are a couple different ball types you can try as well to mix things up, along with general options (stock count, time limit, etc.) There is matchmaking, but it's not skill-based (the community isn't large enough to support skill-based matchmaking anyways).The game is great if you want to just hit buttons and peg your friends with baseballs, and also great if you're looking for something with competitive depth. While the execution barrier is fairly low, you have a lot of freedom of movement/options, and the smarter and more experienced player is still favored to win. Regardless, the game does a great job of hypeing the player up, as hits take progressively longer to complete as the ballspeed increases (giving the feeling of them putting more and more force into the ball), and the screen starts to shake, the background changes, 'impact distortions' occur, all the colors go negative, characters get speed afterimages, and finally the stage goes completely white if you get the ballspeed up enough. Each notch of this progressively makes things more intense, especially the first time you see them!The only drawbacks to me of this game is the playerbase size and occasional crashes. This game has seen occasional boons in playerbase (usually following sales), but on average there's about 60-100 people playing at a time. Games go fairly quick, and you usually won't be waiting more than a minute in quickmatch queue (at least during peak EU and NA hours), but you may run into the same people multiple times. What you don't have in quantity, though, you do have in quality. There's almost always a few people in the group chat willing to play, and many are experienced players who are welcoming and helpful. The competitive LL community is, overall, one of the best communities I've been in.The other drawback is a recurring crash that can occur in multiplayer games of more than 2 people. This only occurs maybe once every 6-7 games, but it can get annoying fairly quick. Fortunately, the game loads almost instantly, so getting back in the action is fast. It's annoying but manageable.I highly suggest you try this game out, especially if you have friends to play it with. $15 may be a bit expensive for some (it was well worth it for me, 450 hours of play and counting), but I would definitely recommend this to anyone at $10 or less.

												This is by far the best ""casual"" fighter in the market. Excellent sense of depth hidden in simple mechanics. When you start out it seems fairly simple like the prototype, but the bunts, supers, and character movement really make the game engaging as time goes on. For example Sonata feels extremely weak early on because of her slow hitting motion and jumps. These are offset by the best early super which is you can get easily while staying high in the air and getting free hits in. Candyman's strengths are obvious with his portal super grabbing easy games off of weaker players but tends to not be as powerful as players get better. Raptor has solid movement and has one of the best late game supers by (fully?) removing the hit stop animation making it sometimes impossible to hit back. Switch seems to be a mid game character with fast movement and his super which redirects the ball. His super has some good potential to net kills fast but becomes much harder to use later in the game. Latch is an all game character with the most broken super which can almost always guarantee kills after 128 speed. The only problem is the online which suffers from is lack of players for non-American/European people. The entire time spent writing this review I have been sitting in queue and still haven't found a game. If you don't have local friends to play with or a tournament scene for this you might not have the best time with this game.			"

Review in English/Spanish 
Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  Fun game with unique art style and a pimping soundtrack, gameplay is simple but addictive yet I can’t fully recommend it. Lethal League focus is on multiplayer but it's somewhat dead as finding a match can be problematic, only after looking for people in the forum or chat was I able to  play online so bear that in mind.The game also has a single player mode but it's pretty short.  Español:  Juego corto y entretenido con un estilo visual único y una banda sonora bastante guapa, es algo simple pero altamente adictivo. Desafortunadamente no puedo recomendarlo por completo pues Lethal League se enfoca principalmente en el multiplayer el cual parece estar algo muerto, en varias ocasiones estuve buscando una partida y no fue posible jugar en linea hasta que busque por otros medios (foros, chat) y eso señores, es una patada inmensa en las bolas.En definitiva, un buen juego mas no lo compraría a menos que tuviese amigos con los cuales hacer co-op.

IntroductionHave you ever wondered what it would be like for superheroes (or beings with superpowers) to play various sports? Perhaps dodgeball? Or baseball? No doubt they would take things to a new extreme, with smashes that break the laws of physics and reaction speeds at mere fractions of milliseconds. Lethal League is a little like that. Imagine Super Smash Brothers but on PC and instead of fighting, you're essentially playing dodgeball in a fairly small arena. Things can get real chaotic, but boy is it fun!GameplayLethal League combines sport, with a highly competitive and slightly strategic game that requires you to have good timing, or a good understanding of angles. This does not mean it's a math or physics game. It simply means Lethal League has an extremely high skill ceiling whilst having a very low barrier to entry. Anyone can pick this up with their friends or play vs bots and have a really great time, and those with the best reaction times can duke it out for the top spots.Your goal is to eliminate all your opponents, by hitting the ball into them. The standard game mode allows you to tag the ball which puts it in your colour and makes it pass through you (so that you don't hit yourself). You can also disable ball tagging for a much more challenging experience. Each time you hit the ball, it goes a little faster. You can hit it up or down depending on whether you are in the air or on the ground. If you smash a ball (air hit) the ball speed is doubled. Now this is where the real fun comes in. If you manage to get 3 or more smashes in, the ball speed is going to ramp up so fast that it quickly becomes a blur of lines in various angles. This is where a knowledge of angles can help you to overcome your opponent. The maximum speed seems to be capped at 1 million. As you break through known speed limits, your hits gradually have a longer delay but the ball speed is so fast that it becomes ALMOST impossible to react to it. You're likely going to struggle with this until you learn the timing windows for various hits, and it is oh so satisfying to counter a ball ping-ponging across the room at over 100,000 (whatever the speed measurement is) into your opponent.You can also bunt the ball in various directions, temporarily slowing it down and allowing you to regain control and possibly change its direction. This is used in combination with regular hits to quickly rack up speed or pull off an unexpectedly fast smash, because bunting a ball reduces the delay on a hit (even the insanely fast ones that require 2-4 seconds of delay) to almost nothing. CharactersThere are 6 characters to choose from and each of them have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Some of them can jump higher than others, some can jump off walls indefinitely etc. This alone would make it fun, however the devs decided this is not enough so they added special abilities. Where do I even begin? Special abilities can drastically change the course of a match in an instant! By hitting the ball you gain charges of your special meter. At 4 charges you can use the ability by double tapping the regular hitting button. Each character has their own unique move that you'll discover on your own, and it adds so much more fun to the game along with previously mentioned elements.VisualsThe visual style of this game is unique, but still quite simple. Characters have some lovely color variations and stages are fairly well designed.AudioI absolutely love the music in this game, as well as the other assorted sounds in the game. When you break the sound barrier, the hit sounds are so impactful and sound like rockets or small bombs going off.Other ThoughtsRunning at 60 FPS is pretty much required to be able to learn your timings properly. The first time I ran the game, it had some very weird frame drops that may have been an issue on my side, but it initially turned me off from the game. However subsequent play sessions did not have that issue, so it must have been some other unrelated issue. The game is very lightweight and runs flawlessly.I would have liked to see more characters in the game, as 6 is hardly a roster of characters compared to other games in this kind of genre. I mean not even the Scout from TF2? That's an iconic character that would have been perfect here.SummaryLethal League is the type of game you can pick up at any time and play with friends. Even as a solo player, you'll find that the bots are quite challenging, and there's enough single player content to keep you interested for even a couple days. The gamplay is fun and rewarding, and is definitely worth checking out if you're interested in a fun, fast, sport-action game.8/10 - The game that destroys friendshipsIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Lethal League is a what you get when you cross a fighting game with dodgeball in all the best ways.  Players jockey to control a small ball, hitting it around the screen in an attempt to knock out eachother.  Every hit on the ball speeds it up, and it quickly moves from an easy to predict slow moving projectile to a streak that bounces around the screen, ricocheting off ceiling, walls, and floor to take out players.  This simple set up leads to an exciting and incredibly fun game.  Unlike most fighting games, there are no long lists of special moves to learn and memorize (each character has slightly differnt angles they will hit the ball at, and a special move that can be powered up during play and used, but no difficult button combos are required for any moves).  This makes the game very intuitive and easy for players to jump in and start playing, even if you are not into fighters.  However, the interplay between player and their specials does lead to a suprising amount of depth in the combat, and learning the timing to intercept balls as they come off of other players at higher speeds will take practice.  If I had any criticisms for the game, it would be that the simplicity of it can be a double edged sword.  Games can start feeling repetative during long play sessions.  Game options can extend this a bit, but in the end most feel gimicky and I find myself losing interest after 30-60 minutes.  However, that being said, I still find myself coming back to this game to get in a few quick rounds against friends when we don't have time for a long playsession, or to finish out a night of gaming.  And that is where the game shines imho, quick bursts of action and excitement when I don't have the time to spend hours playing.This games perfectly fills a niche in my gaming library.  It is well worth the price (and worth getting a few extra copies for your friends as well).  An unreserved thumbs up from me.			"

												Lethal League (LL) is the quintessence of competitive arcade gameplay. Being completely free of over complication, Team Reptile have fortunately channelled the most special elements of the nostalgic games of the golden era, where a sole focus on gameplay has driven design and development. The result being a game with no apparent story, not character progression, and no cheap ways of making you feel as though you should be playing the game, instead it slaps you in the face with a fresh take on Fighters, that is plain and simply, unsullied fun.The gameplay and structure of LL lends itself perfectly to the resolution of longstanding disagreements (1-on-1 Fights), bouts of personal worth and glory (4 way FFA), and also to bond-building exercises (2-on-2 Team Fights). The beautiful thing about the simple gameplay is it works so well not only in the hectic 4-way FFA, but also in 1-on-1 combat, where the simple mechanics eventually boil down to a game of whits, where you are more trying to force the other player/s to swing at the wrong point, or you are trying to think and act fast enough to catch them off-guard.That long winded jargon can be distilled down to; this game is perfect for playing with friends, and that is exactly how it should be consumed. This game has one of those qualities where if you get served too hard, you will hate it; so take it in with friends and you will instantly see the gratifying outcome of learning together, while also pulling off some badass manoeuvres resulting in you all squealing like manly Girl Scouts. We have not tried it in Online Play as my internet services would make the game run like an interactive slideshow. But we can safely say that by grabbing a few ales, a few controllers, and huddling around your PC, you will be parting in the finest display of competition I have seen in a video games since Mario Party 64.Team Reptile have not given this game a huge amount of content, with 5 characters and 6 Levels, BUT, the content in the game is so perfectly polished, I question whether the development team is really as small as they say. We would love to see more playable characters and levels in the future just to give the game that bit of spice, but where it stands now is a testament to where AAA game development falls short in modern game development; where such heavy focus on being the next money making machine makes games lose that…specialness.From a developer’s standpoint this game has soul, you can feel the love that went into it when you play it. So get it, you won’t be disappointed.3 / 3 Worth Playing-C "

												It is one of the most addicting games I have played in ages. Best described as Battle Pong on Steroids with a hint of baseball, the aim  of the game is to bat the ball back and forth between you and your opponent until one of you slips and gets hit. For such a simple premise it is really a challenge when battling against other players and CPU's, thankfully though with the very tight and responsive controls, any mistakes the player would make would entirely be their fault and not due to the game.

												Lethal League is a truly hillarious, over the top take on pong and fighting games.The general concept is to defeat your opponentt and reduce their stocks (think smash bros) by smashing them with the ball. The ball will deal damage to your opponents after you hit it, but can be hit by them, which can then cause it to deal damage to you. As in pong, you keep rallying the ball back and forth, with it getting faster and faster until one of you is hit, at which point you lose a life and the ball resets. What sounds like a very simple concept rapidly becomes a hillarious series of ""Oh ♥♥♥♥!"" moments in which the ball is going so incredibly fast that you'd think it impossible to hit, but then someone does, and it gets even faster.Throw in a bunch of colourful and creative characters and stages, along with an incredible sound track, and some very fancy and flashy visual and sound effects that wouldn't feel out of place in an Anime or Manga, and you get an enjoyable and hillarious experience.Would reccomend playing with friends (up to 4 player) for added hillarity and fun.

tl;dr -> Ultimate dodgeball - but with objects to hit the ball at your opponents - that can get to Dragon Ball Z-level speeds and ruin friendships forever.My brother was really interested in this game, so I got it for him - eventually, I got interested enough from watching it to buy a few copies for myself and some friends. If you like projectile-based fighting, multiplayer frenzies (both local and online), flashy animations and trick shots, and simplistic (but very fleshed-out) gameplay mechanics, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very good - the character models are nice, and the level of detail put into the visuals is well-done. The music is set to a single, level-specific track, but the playlist is pretty good and matches the atmosphere of the game. The special effects are fantastic, and the background will even turn completely white once you achieve ball speeds nearing 1 million. The controls are easy to learn, but mastering them will take a bit of time. The practice is great for getting you familiarized with the gameplay mechanics, and there are many well-written guides available to teach you the advanced techniques. You can play with a controller, and I personally prefer this over the keyboard. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, the most challenging thing being how quickly you can understand the timing mechanic. The main goal in Lethal League is to hit your opponent with the ball. By default setting, you cannot get hit by the ball if you've hit it last (indicated by the ball's outline matching your assigned color). If a ball is ""tagged"" with your color, it will pass through you and any allies, however, you can also hit it again. Each time you hit the ball, it's speed will increase and your special gauge will fill up by one bar (to a total of 4). Bunting the ball and hitting it before it touches a surface will fill your special meter by 2 (and serves other purposes). A bunted ball will have a pinkish outline, indicating that it is a ""free"" ball - anyone can hit it, and it is not hostile to any player until it is hit. When a burst (round) is over, the first player to have been knocked out in the previous round will have possession of the ball, indicated by a matching outline around it. After a few seconds, however, it will lose it's outline, allowing anyone to hit it.At higher speeds, hitting the ball will cause a hit lag animation, where your character will stay in one spot to charge up, then release the ball. During this time, all other characters can move around to try to position to hit or dodge the ball. There is a mirrored ball-release gauge at the bottom center of the screen, which is a critical tool to use - it will show you how long you have before the ball is released from the hit lag animation. Traditionally, at slow speeds, the gauge will fill up super fast. Bunting is important because a successful hit following one will shorten the ball-release gauge time. The different characters telegraph their moves, so bunting during a long rally (back-and-forth hits) can really help you throw off people's reaction time if they're expecting you to hit a ball immediately back at them. Each character has a unique special, and many of them allow you to do things like bypass the ball-release gauge time (causing the ball to be released regardless of the gauge status), redirect the ball's trajectory (especially dangerous when people have positioned in an angle to catch the ball), or even curve the ball (super awesome trick shot potential). One character has a special that allows the ball to phase through the map (so instead of bouncing, it will continue through and appear on the opposite side). The characters also differ in playstyle, and you will notice things like quicker hits for some, higher jumps, longer hit range, etc. One character, Sonata, can double jump. Raptor, who cannot double jump and has a fairly short vertical range, compensates for this by being able to wall hang and wall jump. Latch can, well, latch onto the wall, moving up and down freely. If you and an opponent swing at each other at the same time, you will clash, pushing each other backwards and stun-locking you for a few seconds. This is especially dangerous if you are stun-locked by an opponent who just finished hitting the ball forward because it will instantly hit you. This game really rewards skill and patience - if you just spam the hit/bunt button, you will get hit by the fall often because it takes time for each character to recover from the hit/bunt animation, leaving you vulnerable. You can even do something as face the wrong way, and will meet a sudden (temporary) death.There is a singleplayer challenge mode you can do, which has the same opponents regardless of which character you pick, and a unique boss match. The game's AI is fairly challenging, and at times seems to randomly turn up to a ""destroy all hope in the human opponent"" rating. There are other variants to play, like a score attack (versus stock), and a team scoring game where you have to hit a target on the opposite side (you cannot hit each other in this mode).Overall, the game is extremely fun, and will be enjoyed by people who like projectile-based fighting.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I've been playing this game for a decent amount of time now, and I have almost nothing but positive things to say about it.- It's a very fast paced game with a rather high skill cap to achieve.- Easy(ish) to learn, and all around fun to play for hours on end.- A somewhat small yet very friendly community towards all players.- Community held tournies keep the playerbase intact and alive.- The game can be played with either keyboard or controller with only slight advantages using the controller.- The game is brutal with it's matchmaking and really lets you know what you're in for when you face opponents with over 1k+ hours. (It's okay to suck, you'll just suck less next time!)- The game runs smoothly consistently; ie: no sudden frame drops, no visual tearing, etc.One of the only bad things I've found about this game so far is how long it can take to get a matchmaking game sometimes, but the gameplay definitely overwhelms that con so it all works out in the end.I give this game an honest 10/10, it's really a great game but sadly doesn't have as much of a player following as I wish it did.

												Legal League is a wonderful simulation of the Legal systems of many countries across the world. The league of five Lawyers meet up day after day battling for justice in their countries, and working nonstop to get the just jurisdiction. All the Lawyers have wonderful story lines, such as Raptor Attorney at Law constantly struggles due to being young, however in the court he is very agressive and a wonderful Lawyer. The hardest part of Legal League is when you travel to Somalia and try to convict various people of their horrible war crimes on behalf of the United Nations' Legal Department. This is evident as Somalia has not had a fully functioning government and thus Legal system since 1991.Overall Legal League has show a great deal of the world's Legal Practices and thus recives a 10/10 for being such a great and interesting educational experience. Thank you, Legal Team Reptile for creating and expressing your works in the legal side of the world.			"

												This game is just INCREDIBLE. Fun to play, takes about 30 minutes to get to the ""decent"" level of skill, but a lot of time to master the game, giving it some replayability. The characters are diverse, each with their own unique special moves and hit angles, and best of all, it's getting constantly updated and rebalanced if need be. The community is constantly growing, and the game has a great competitive side to it. 10/10, GOTY 2014 for me. It's just that good, try it, seriously.			"

												Lethal League is an extremely fun fighting game up to 4 players fighting with super balls to take down each other.Seriously it's very addicting if you have friends to play with.You have ""Free for All"", ""Team Deathmatch"" and ""Strikers"" modes, and several characters to choose from and each character has unique movements and abilities.However, i never found a multiplayer game, i think the game is dead, but had a lot of fun playing it locally with my nephew.Technically the game is smooth, bug-free and very stable while the graphics are cartoonish.Single Player: 7.5/10Multiplayer: 10/10Totally Recommended to buy it if you have friends, if not check the forums to get players to play together.

												This game is a wallball-esque/tennis combat system where you time your swings and kick the ball back to the opponent in hopes to hit him before he has time to respond to the ball. Sounds too simple to be fun, right?Wrong. My friend and I bought this game as a bit of a joke but ended up playing it for hours. I had raw fun while playing this, the kind that you experience only rarely in quality indie titles like Hotline Miami, Skullgirls, etc.With 2-3 different game modes, 6 characters, and 7 maps this game is quite small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in strength. The characters are unique, with mildly entertaining special moves for each of them. The maps each have their own music (The music is surprisingly good in this game). The most interesting aspect of the game is the D-pad+Y shout out. You can taunt, or interact, with your opponent by stating,""Oops"", ""Wow"", ""Nice"", and ""Bring it on"". The tricky part of the game is the ball speed. As you paddle back and forth the ball speed will increase and you'll have to be much more instinctive about your response times. I saw an achievement for 1,000,000 ball speed. My friend and I have only gotten to 1,000. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it worth $10-$14? Not really, but you can always get it on sale. "

												It's like a mixture of Mortal Kombat and Pong, a great game for playing with friends; however, most people I know own a MAC and I can't play with them.  It is still a ridiculously fun game, even if none of your friends can play with you, especially 1v1 battles.  And when the ball speed is to the max when you start, it's even more difficult and fun.100/100 Would buy again.(Note: There used to be 5 characters to choose from [Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Latch, and Sonata] and they've added a 6th recently [Dice] and it's a great addition for people that have a difficult time playing this game.  Down side is that his jump is half of what others are and he's quite slow.  His ability is like a Yo-Yo movement.)GET THE GAME WHILE IT'S HERE!!!			"

	TL;DR: I reccomend Lethal League to people who have friends that also play Lethal League. Pros:-Good music-Easy to learn, hard to master -Good controls-Fun with friendsCons:-Small bugs-Boring single player-Not updated too often-Matchmaking is clunky-Costs too much (I recommend waiting until this game is on sale or buying it off G2@)Rating: 7/10Honestly I have had some of the best times with my friends playing Lethal League. The feeling of tying all of your hits together and taking out your opponent is one of the most rewarding feelings I have ever had in a video game. This game has been fun (for me) ever since the day I got it to now. Although I love this game very much, I don't think it is for everyone. If you don't have any other friends who own this game, then I think you should either buy the four pack, or just not bother buying the game. The single player is boring and repetitve and the matchmaking isn't really worth your time due to connection issues and bugs.			"

												A unique, fun and quirky fighter where the aim is to hit your opponent with a ball you hit at them. You could argue the premise is simple and the lack of story mode may put people off. But it's a fighting game and an incredibly fun one at that. Especially with friends. I wouldn't personally pay full price though since it has such a small roster of characters and lack of modes.

												TL:DR Whether you're good at fighters or not, this game is extremely fun and easy to learn, BUY IT!Alright. Welp. This game is GREAT. Lethal League is a unique fighting time that's pretty much based on timing. You must hit the ball in time so your opponent doesn't kill you. You're basically playing ball tag with your opponent. You try to hit the ball to each other and whoever hits too early or doesn't pay attention will get hit and die. I'm kinda bad at explaining this so maybe it doesn't sound like the funnest game, but trust me ITS FUN! You know one thing I really like about this game? Call me a f*cking casualist if you want, but, ya know, it takes more Rythm than skill. This game you can ACTUALLY WIN without hours and hours of experience. Unlike Skullgirls, where you need to watch sh*t to learn combos or take hours to learn on your own or even been born in the 80s playing fighters at da arcade. The thing is about Skullgirls, if you go in online with a couple hours of play, you'll get the sh*t beat out of you. I guess what I'm saying is, I'm not really a fan of arcade fighters. My issue with dem arcade fighters is the crazy ♥♥♥ combos you have to make to do powerful attacks. But, anyway yea. BUY LETHAL LEAGUE!!! It's a competitive and Casual game!			"

												I eye my top-heavy crocodile opponent from across the field as a purple coated ball begins to spawn between us. He points his stout towards the object, knowing that he's going to smash this into my cold, yellow face. Not today, Latch. Not today.The ball materializes and we rush towards it. My cane is already extended for an over the head smash to hit the reptilian foe below me. Time seems to stop as I connect with the latent power resting within the ball. The crocodile was quick to react and seemed to stop all momentum I had with my initial hit with one tap of his nose. The ball soared over me, and before I connected with the ground the crocodile was already rallying the ball against a wall, hoping to power up another devastating blow.I rush to intervene in his sadistic wall-ball ritual, tapping the ball out of his rhythm at an upwards angle. Furious, Latch's eyes glowed red towards the cane that brought an end to his games. He claws the wall in front of him and begins to climb up its structure to catch up to the ball. Flipping outwards, he catches the ball in his mouth and my world goes dark. All I can see is the crocodile's burning descent from the wall, his eyes reflecting my helpless yellow face.I jump upwards to dodge the assult, but Latch releases the saliva-covered ball angled with precision towards my jump peak. The counter at the bottom reads into the hundreds, and I know that reflecting this is going to take all the luck in my thin smiley-faced bones. My cane relexively reaches in defense, and this was all the luck I needed. The ball's momentum is reversed right at the crocodile's pointed nose. But what stops him from doing exactly what I just did?I try to land a second hit and throw Latch off his prediction. He sees this and attempts to outsmart my own moves. We negate each other's attacks with a twang of cane and stout, the ball landing just behind Latch. I see it bounce off the corners of the rotting arena with bliding speed, and I process that it's coming right back at me. Cane out, I bunt the ball directly downwards into where the crocodile attempts another intervention. His tail whips around, but he is too early.The ball lightly bounces off the top of his scaly skull, and he's sent below the arena.BURST 2, BEGIN!			"

												It's a fighting game, it's pong, it's expressive, it's a party game, and I never would have bought it if I wasn't introduced to it at a party, because trailers have a really hard time capturing why it's so much fun.The gameplay lives off a wide array of mechanics that are all accessed by basic movement keys and 2 more buttons. Different characters don't only have unique special abilities as showcased in the trailer but also subtle differences in the way they move, their hitboxes and the angles in which they hit the ball.At first, the game is just enjoyable without having any clue of what's even happening, but once you play more you get an idea of how high the skill ceiling actually is.

												Just started to play and what I've seen so far is enough to recommend this game to everyone.Mechanics are rock solid (amazing with every game mode, from 1v1 to 2v2 to free for all)Animations are really well done and backgrounds are just as simple as fitting to create a futuristic (cyberpunk) atmosphere.Music, just a cherry on top, blends perfectly and gives a certain enjoyable rhythm to the matches.It's not a ""deep"" fighting game, but it is definitely a unique one (no other fighting/brawling games have a dodgeball-like mechanic as far as I know) and even if there are no fancy commands/moves it gets pretty technical with angles/feints/tactics.Again, strongly recommended to everyone.

This game has allowed me to meet some really amazing people, and the community is still growing, and I can tell it's gonna hit it big. Give the game a chance.

												This game was my entire 2015.In that year, I racked up over 600 hours, made friends with enough people to increase my friends list by what feels like 500%, I never wanted to stop improving my reads and tech, saw the game's parry mechanic change like 3 times, complained online about parries for a straight month, found out some new useless tech, participated in an amazing tournament scene, ended up organizing my own tournaments for newer players, dropped in on people streaming the game on Twitch, made even more friends, and started streaming the game myself. Although the game has a lot of problem, the community has slowed down nowadays, and I don't really play it that often anymore, it's still one of the best games I have ever spent my time with.			"

												There’s so many addicting yet simply games, but Lethal League isn’t one of them. It’s a sort of a dodgeball, or squash rather, where you hit a ball (obviously) which gets faster and faster any time you score a combo. Your goal is to K.O. your opponent. Easy to pick up rules makes a very simple concept for the game that anyone’ll understand, but it gets so old very quickly at the same time. Seriously it’s just boring as hell. On top of that, there’s hardly anyone playing this game online. Still there’s a local multiplayer I guess, so if you’re into that kind of games than you’ll be happy about it. I’m certainly not, so I’m not recommending it.			"

												I usually don't write reviews after only playing for a half hour. I tend to wait until I've either finished the game or played a large enough portion before getting bored with it to come to a valid conclusion.What I've seen of Lethal League so far indicates that it's a supremely addictive game. Simple mechanics are coupled with a very high skill ceiling and lots of challenge, which over the course of each match escalates to ludicrous heights. Each character has a very different set of abilities beyond simply tossing the ball around and the combination of a variety of characters make on-the-fly strategizing against them very entertaining. Overall I'd give Lethal League a big recommendation on that front.However, the connection issues are what absolutely kill this game for me at the moment. Every other match doesn't load properly and I've had plenty of disconnects even with players in my own region. Mind you that I have a 15MB/s (that's Megabyte, not Megabit) connection where my PC is connected via Ethernet cable and not Wi-Fi, so my connection is about as solid as you can get, and yet it still fails around 50% of the time. I won't cry about connection times since I realize that they're mostly down to the amount of active players, but once a connection is established, it's amazing how bad the game manages to function. Not to mention that when the game does actually hang up and never starts the next match, you can't simply get out again by pressing Escape or any other keys. You have to terminate the application with Alt+F4 every single time this happens, and it can get very annoying. I was fortunate enough to have bought the game with the recent Humble Monthly, so it cost me around $1.2, or 90% less than what's asked for here on Steam, which is why I'll keep the game and give it a mild pass in order to see if the issues get resolved in the future. But for the record, had I paid full price, I'd have refunded this broken mess immediately. Which is unfortunate, a game with solid mechanics and the potential for hours of fun is shot in the kneecaps by terrible connection issues.If the issues get resolved, I will edit this review to reflect any future changes made here.

												One of the most insane fighting games I have ever experienced. Lethal League takes the fun party game feel, and colorful roster of characters from Smash Brothers. And combines it with the the most intense dodgeball game in the universe. The only way for you to knock out your opponent is to smack the ball in to their face. Bring in 2 or 3 of your friends and you have fun in its purest and hypest form. The single player is a challenge, especially the final boss. You'd really have to dedicate yourself enough to actually become skilled enough to stand toe to toe with it (or you could actually be good at video games, which I am not). Overall a fantastic fighting game, and if there is even a chance of it getting a sequel I'm all on board.			"

												So basically you start out hitting a ball at pretty decent speeds until one of you gets their skull cracked open. The longer you survive the more ridiculous it gets, to the point where I'm pretty sure I was hitting the ball at light speed. It was terrifying and hilarious. Especially since faster hits have weird visual effects on maps (like, on one map all the windows break, an eclipse happens, and rioting mobs appear.) that then vanish when the ball is no longer being hit. Its like youre ripping into an alternate dimension.I should mention that my first (and so far only) play session lasted two whole hours, but felt closer to 30 mins. So, overall, pretty damn great. I usually complain a lot in reviews (...on Amazon. I rarely do Steam reviews) but I don't even have any complaints about this.If you're unsure about buying it, just do. You won't regret it.			"

												Lethal League is a competitive ""battle pong"" that has you take control of one of six players, each with different styles of play, in a deadly game of tag-by-baseball. The fundamentals of the game are pretty simple: Hit the ball and it changes to your color and will damage every enemy player but not yourself. Bunting will send the ball upward and give you a chance to reposition for a better attack. Any time you hit the ball you build up a super meter that will allow you to perform a special attack once filled. The majority of strategy in LL revolves around two things: hit meter/lag, and angles. You'll need to pay attention to the hit meter at the bottom of the screen to know how much longer it will be before the hit lag ends and the ball continues on in play. Knowing when it will re-enter play will allow you to position yourself accordingly and begin your counter attack. Another important factor is being aware of the angle the ball takes (or will take if you can predict it) since knowing that will allow you to take control of it with your own strike or avoid getting knocked out. Lethal League basically has two modes spread across several categories: Versus (Online/Local/Challenge) and Strikers. Versus is the basic game mode where you have a limited number of life stocks and the game ends when you or your team run out of them. Strikers puts you in position of a goal that you must keep the enemy team from hitting with an enemy-charged ball. There is also a point game in the challenge mode which is like versus but you play until one player gets a set number of kills.Since the game only has six playable characters, six stages, and really just two modes (only one of which seem to be played online: versus). You'll probably find yourself running out of things to do without having a bunch of friends to play with. Not to mention the online community is rather small and it can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes just to find a match, and when you do find a match, having any kind of lag between the players can make some rounds pretty difficult as the ball bounces and hit lag can become downright unpredictable. There are definitely some fun times to be had when you get matched up with a decent opponent, though.I would recommend grabbing this game somewhere around $5 or cheaper to really get your money's worth. It's not a bad game per-se, it just needs more content.			"

												Fun game, can be crazy at times and I recommend using a controller because of the better control, only good for playing online against people because bots are terrible. Each character has a automatic modifier on the ball after hitting the ball 4 times. Dont play against bots because they are crappy and cheap to play against, they should remove the achivments for it and really fix them so they are more human-like on the reactions. ie. Following the ball and always hitting it the split second its near them. If you ever get stuck hitting the ball back to eachother when standing next to the harder level bot they will ALWAYS hit it the second the ball starts to move so its almost impossible to win, if you put a high level bot v bot in that situation the game wouldn't end.)

												Lethal League is a game that I could only describe as ""A special kind of addicting"". While it's at its best in multiplayer, this gem of a game will be able to keep any player enveloped for a good amount of time after they start playing. Playing as a sort of cross between Super Smash Brothers and Pong, Lethal League employs up to 4 player in a fight to the death where the only means of downing an opponent is to bat an anti-gravity baseball into them. The characters, while limited at the moment, are all a joy to control and all have interesting designs, my personal favorite of the bunch being Candyman. Lethal League really is a blast to play, and is my personal pick for Indie Game of the Year. If you ever pick it, chances are that you won't be putting it down for a very long while.			"

Everything about it feels good to do, and even when you're at vastly different experience levels from your oponent you can get a win that doesn't feel unfair for either side.It goes about eight layers deeper than the trailer shows - specials, parries, bunts, clashes, it's all good and it all works together  seamlessly.

												Ok, so first of all, some people think that the actual content that this game offers doesn't really justify it's price. I don't share this opinion, the game isn't really all that expensive and while the content may be limited, there is just a lot of fun to be had with it. However, I still strongly urge anyone who considers buying Lethal League to get some friends to play this game with and buy a 2 or a 4-pack and split the price. The multipacks are pretty good deals, and the game is the most fun when you are playing it with a friend anyway.Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about why you should buy this game, because you absolutely should.Lethal League is a projectile based 2-D fighter with an interesting, kind of jet-set-like style to it. It features a surprisingly good soundtrack that really complements the gameplay as well as the overall feel of the game. Lethal League actually has very few mechanics, yet still provides a decent amount of depth, so it is pretty easy to pick up while being able to entertain and challenge you for a long amount of time. Basically, the goal in this game is to hit your opponent with an anti-gravity-ball which will cause them to lose one life instantly. You can hit or bunt the ball in various fashions to make it reach ludicrious speeds and bounce around in crazy patterns, and believe me, it's just mad fun. The sheer insanity of the gameplay paired with the incredible soundtrack and cool visual just makes it a blast to watch or play. There are currently six characters which differ in mobility and special moves, as well as the angles they can make the ball travel at.The game doesn't really offer all that interesting offline modes, but it's most enjoyable in multyplayer anyway. You can play free for alls, team fights and 1v1s. Lethal League, just like Skullgirls, uses GGPO and it results in super smooth feeling online play.So, if the concept sounds at least a bit appealing to you and you have someone to play it with, you really owe yourself to pick it up, especially since there are not much games that are able to offer you a similar expierence out there.

												If you're considering buying this game to play it with friends, stop reading reviews and just buy itIf you don't have fun, I will personally come to your house and refund you the money you spentFun party game with a very competitive multiplayer scene, similar to Smash BrosVery simple, intuitive mechanics - it's easy to pick up and play, while maintaining a high skill ceiling (see: candychaining)Some mechanics aren't presented with much depth in the tutorial, so consider spending a while on Google to learn about parrying and Switch's specialOnline will have you disconnect once or twice before you can connect to an opponent, but once you find a game it can continue as long as you like, I've had one 1v1 go on for a few hours - relatively short queues, 3 minutes is considered a long queue imoAll that being said, I picked up this game recently and have been hooked ever since, and I don't see myself losing interest any time soonEDIT: One year post-review and the online is mostly dead. The only people playing right now are the die-hards and tryhards, which makes it difficult to learn the game. Pick it up if you plan to play with friends or if the game is on sale.			"

												Lethal League is a competative baseball/dodgeball hybrid that supports up to four players in one match. With each strike of the ball, the speed is doubled, sometimes even quadrupled (and in serious cases, maxed at one million). Maybe you and a few friends sit on the couch and hit the ball back and forth a few times. Maybe it's you and a stranger online. Regardless, every hit and dodge are anxiety and adrenaline riddled. With more than four friends who've enjoyed this game with me, we've never experienced any rage or upsetting losses, only awe at how insane it is to bunt the ball at such ridiculous speeds and then pelt it right back at the poor soul who bashed it towards you in the first place. Each character has a special ability that makes the matches all that much more interesting once they've filled their blue bar. Beware Dice and Candy Man. There's also an interesting secret character which you can play as in local matches; I'll let you google the code for yourself.My friends and I give this game a 10/10 for competative shenanigans and I give it a 9/10 for the minor network bugs. Worth the price, but I'm glad I snagged it on the humblebundle for a buck.			"

												The faster the ball goes the more like Russian Roulette the game becomes. If a game could ever make me have a Viet Nam flashback from seeing a ball...it would be this game.The character specials can be a bit cheap and unfair (CandyMan's in particular) and the game is pretty much only fun on multiplier, I also feel like we needed a few more characters, but other than that I sincerely can't complain. The game is also a bit on the pricey side-- But if you see a Steam Sale, I definitely recommend grabbing it as you won't be disappointed. While you're at it grab the 4 player pack for you and your buddies. The game is very lightweight and loads quickly, I feel just about any computer can handle it.			"

												A game that seems simple at first glance, but has a surprisingly high skill ceiling. This unique ""fighting"" game still has me on the edge of my seat, with intense high-speed battles.Lethal League plays a bit differently than other fighting games, since you have little effect on your opponent directly. Instead, to knock them out, you must hit a levitating ball and land a direct hit, while your opponent tries to do the same to you. Mind-games come into play as you can hit the ball under an angle up and down, which causes it to bounce rapidly around the stage!Other features: Sweet music and high moddability (Sprites, music, UI).While the GGPO connection actually works great (A high ping player will bring down any game, really) once the match has started, there are some issues when starting the match, occasionally locking up the game. The devs seem to want to try to fix this issue currently, so hopefully this (pretty big) flaw will be sorted out soon.			"

												There's not a lot to say about Lethal League. And that's by no means a bad thing, I wish I could say a lot of things about this game, because I find it to be one of the better PvP games I've played in a long time. The game is simple: think of it like... racketball, with an anime escalation twist. Battle Pong. The game gives you a good amount of option, the characters are varied, and the game is simple enough to pick up and play, but just complex enough to really garner competitive spirit. My only complaint (and this goes for a lot of fighters, as well) is that certain parts of the system are not presented to player really at all. But other than that, Lethal League is a well crafted game that's simply a blast to play.			"

Each time the ball is hit it is faster to a bizarre speed. The game is very fun to play with friends. The graphics is very clean and a bit retro, with large images in pixel art.

												Saw a couple videos about this game and it looked pretty fun. When I got the game it was VERY fun. I mostly played with Bots to practice but it was still fun anyways. I'm guessing the game will be very exciting if you have at least three friends you have it. 9/10. Can't wait to see what other updates this game will bring			"

												The game is fun enough on its own, but get a few friends together and it's a great time. It put me off initially because it's a bit hard when you first start out, but you'll pick it up quickly. When you do, it's a great time.

												I said this might be the next Windammers, but it's a whole step beyond that. It's a 4 player party with working internet play that is essentially the time-tested gameplay of Pong mixed with the brutality of Super Dodge Ball at supersonic speeds. It just feels super satisfying to hit that ball, it's pure excitement. It's also got actually challenging challenges, working Internet play using the GGPO framework (which is a marvel in itself) and some unlockables.It's light on content, but when what you have is SO GOOD, i'm not going to complain about that. A nice simple game with askill ceiling of practically infinite height, the ultimate duel for bragging rights. If you take home 1st in this you will KNOW you earned it.			"

												The best way to describe Lethal League is as a simplification of the fighter genre mixed with a projectile game.Divekick did that in that fact that instead of having complicated moves, it became more about timing and mind games.Lethal League does that in your positioning, your timing (although its pretty easy to get good at that), and your ability to change things up enough to freak out the opponent. If you don't mess with their head, and you're both good at the timing and positioning, the game can go on for a long time.It's a lot about making less mistakes than the other person. In fact, that's pretty much how you win.But enough about that, why should you play this game?PROS:- Easy to just play, easy to get good at, but relatively hard to get REALLY good at- Can keep you busy with just the singleplayer, but has a decent online matchmaking system, as well as local and online 4 player, similar to smash bros- Good at not frustrating the player, the most fun way to play if the best way to win- Gameplay that manages to be fast but also slow??? It works, trust me- Awesome music- Funky art- No weak ♥♥♥♥CONS:- Small character roster (Also a pro because it's easier to learn everything)- Much lower skill cap than other fighters (doesn't mean it can't be competetive)- Really grindy level up system (at least you get rewards for every level in the form of colour palletes and different balls which change up gameplay)In short, if you like unique fighters, or Jet Set Radio, or both (like me), this game should be appealing to you.Also a good party game. Not that I'd know.			"

												A very underrated little gem on Steam. The characters are diverse and are all mechanically unique in someway, but I find they are all equally fun to play as.

												You like baseball? You like Street Fighter? Then this game won't be for you. You hit the ball in the middle to gain control and it goes just a bit faster.Someone else hits it, it gives them control and goes even faster.The ball can go up to 1 million in speed and then it can't go faster.You will get used to the game after a while and you might choose Switch. The most complicated person you can play on this game.Everyone has a special move by double tapping the hit button when you hit it. But with Switch you have to double tap the jump button to do his special. It's complicated like that.With this community base also, it's worth every dollar you use for this game.Just pick it up and play around in Challange mode or vs your friends or just strangers.Either way you'll have fun. The sound track is also amazing to listen to while playing this awesome game. Just pick it up.			"

												Definitely my pick for the most fun to be had in a game in several years! Lethal League is a projectile fighting game which starts off easy to learn, then quickly scales into either a chaotic mess of fun to be had with your friends or a very interesting competitive experience. With a gameplay system that's much deeper than it would seem at a glance, Lethal League provides fun to whoever is willing to give it a shot, and I'd highly recommend you fork out a few bucks for the game that keeps on giving.It being a multiplayer game, it does suffer from the usual lack of opponents issue when you want to play against someone in less than ideal circumstances. The art of the game certainly isn't particularly striking or unique in any way, just enough so to serve its purpose. Lethal League also suffers from a lack of diverse content, but that's forgivable as what content there is has been polished to a mirror shine.Every shortcoming listed is easily ignored in favor of a Higher Fun, and you should definitely get in on the chaos everyone's talking about!

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.			"

This game is literally the best fighting game, both soundtrack and gameplay wise, I've ever played. It incorporates simple, easy to understand concepts with intensely reactive meta game in order to accomplish a speedy-twitch strike style of gameplay you'll find nowhere else. Lacking slightly in content, the developers plan to make at least one more stage and character for the game with the hope that more will follow! Pick it up and I'll see you in game. ;)			"

												Lethal League. Jolly ol' Lethal League.What can I say about this game, considering I just got it yesterday? A lot. I guess.THE STORY:There is no story. :/THE GAMEPLAY:Imagine Super Smash Bros. with no platforms floating in the sky. Then, add dodgeball into the mix. Yeah. Dodgeball. Who doesn't like that maniacal, murderous hellfest of a game? It's better than it sounds though, which means there won't be any dodgeballs flying at your literal face. Realism.The controls are pretty simple. You use the left and right arrow keys to move... fairly simple. Z to attack... sure. X to stop the ball from zip-zapping all over the place... cool. Spacebar to jump... aweso--Wait a sec... the Spacebar to jump? That's a bit unexpected for a Steam game, don't you think?When you hit the ball, you can use the up and down keys to set the angle you're going to hit the ball with.You have 8 lives by default (you can change it in settings) and it's your job to knock out your opponents one by one. When the ball is your colour, it can't hurt you at all. Or can it? I have no idea.In terms of colours, P1 has red, P2 has blue, P3 has yellow and P4 has green. Cool.Like Smash Bros, there are different skins (or ""flavours"") for each character. None of the skins, heck, none of the characters play any different. So really, you can just choose any character without any problems.Unless...The special attacks!Each character has their own special attack. Candyman has Candyball (in which the ball can teleport through walls and look like an awesome face while it's at it), Latch has...Um......Serves me right for only playing as Candyman.What can I say? I love him and his jawbreakers. No matter how weird they taste. (innuendo not intended)You can hit the ball 4 times until you can use your special attack. Just press Z two times. It doesn't always work though.THE GAMEMODES:Online, versus, challenge and training. That's it.But, there are sub-gamemodes in the versus mode. There's free-for-all (self-explanatory), team (again, self explanatory) and strikers (each team has to hit the ball in the goals they're trying to attack. In other words... soccer.THE VISUALS:The visuals are kinda like the 2003 Ninja Turtles cartoon. Cartoonish, but pretty edgy as well. The graphics look a bit pixel-y, but they do the job well.THE MUSIC:Not the best soundtrack. The tracks are pretty cool, but I'd be screwed if I remember what they sound like.They're better than my music though. I'll tell you that.PROGRESSION:Each time you play the game, you earn EXP. You all know what that is. Progressing to more levels gives you new ""flavours"" to try out. I especially like the black Candyman. He tastes like licorice.FINAL VERDICT:The game is pretty fun and memorable, and it's one of the most innovative Steam games I've seen (and this game was made in the 2010's, when Call of Duty was still around). Sadly, there is no local multiplayer, but I'll forgive it, considering that it's not frickin' Fireboy and Watergirl.My final word on this game is that this game is... GREAT.			"

												This is probably one of the best indie 'Brawler' games out currently if not the best. It's unique, having you bat an increasingly-speed ball around in attempts to knock out all other opponents, but also still very competitive. There is no ranked play from the time that I played, and there is really no real content either than just the main arena. Each character is very unique in their own ways while still being very balanced as well which is kind of hard to do in Brawlers from what I've seen. There is even a main campaign that is actually challenging and interesting, another thing Brawlers can't seem to get.I keep saying 'Brawler' because it is described as a fighting game and your goal is, technically, to bat your opponents out of the arena. Due to it's lack of content though you're gonna get your greatest enjoyment from playing with friends. There is no collectibles or secrets or hidden characters or anything so there isn't a whole lot more to do than just the arena, if I hadn't made that clear. This game would have to earn a 4/5 from me but it could easily get a 5 if they add more content.			"

												TLDR: Great game. Not much when playing alone, but with friends it is TERRIFYING FUN!Lethal League is a game that sets the line between babies and men. A game of Russian Roulette where you and your competitor hit an antigravity ball back and forth at increasing speed until somebody gets wrecked and dies! I say this is the line of boys and men because I have had many a time where I've been cowering in fear, PRAYING that God will take the ball and protect his child from it.

												It's really addicting. It's the perfect pick-up-and-play game that epitomizes the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" mechanics of a fighting game. It looks and feels like an old arcade game with very simple controls (run, jump, swing, bunt), but the unique spin it takes on the fighting game genre is very refreshing and it creates a very enjoyable atmosphere, even for those that are not a fan of fighting games such as myself. The soundtrack is upbeat and plays along well with the arcade style. My only complaints are that you can't create a public room with your friends in it, and then search for more to fill the lobby. It's either your friends in a private game, or strangers in a public, unless you are lucky enough to be selected as the host in a public room and there is an empty spot for a friend. At $14, the small amount of content (six characters, seven maps, three game modes) isn't a surprise or a rip-off. You get what you pay for; a fun, whacky mix between Pong and Street Fighter that just feels like a classic you've missed out on.			"

												Most fun I've ever had in any local multiplayer game, even if I keep losing TT_TT---ReviewAs I have said, Lethal League is a very fun multiplayer game. It is easy to learn but hard to master, and has a pretty high skill cap.Pros: Memorable catchy house music. A unique concept of pong/baseball/fighting all combined into one game that is really blood-pumping and may cause some screaming if you're playing a LAN. Solid mechanics The controls are tight 6 different characters you can choose from with different abilities (and hit angles). You can play in quick short bursts, maybe when you're queuing for a Dota 2 game, CSGO, anything really. The art is unique. The animations are very smooth. The voice acting isn't cringe-worthy and is very well done. Playing with lag is somewhat manageable, unlike in some FPS and other games where lag is very important to not have. Hardly any bugs.Cons: Current playerbase isn't too big so actually finding a game is sometimes impossible. You can check on SteamDB[steamdb.info] to see how many players are playing at the moment so you can actually find an opponent. Price is a bit too expensive for some people. Rare crashes.That's all I could think of for cons, really.WishlistThe things I wish was in the game More characters A cheaper price to increase the playerbaseFINAL VERDICT:85/100This game is really different to most other fighting games, if you can afford it, buy it when it is on sale, usually it's around $5, so get it!

												What can I say about Lethal League that hasn't already been said? It's a fantastic game, and one worth playing for quite a while! Team Reptile did an amazing job with this title, ranging from the excellent gameplay, to the beautiful soundtrack, even to the art the game displays so well. Let's have a jawbreaker and take a look, shall we? Intro: Lethal League is a game that will test you and make sure you make the right decisions, or you're going to strike out fast! The aim of the game is to smack a ball and try to hit your opponent with it to knock him out, which makes him lose a piece of health. Everytime you hit the ball it turns your color so you can't get hit until he hits it back! You play as one of six total characters: Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Sonata, Latch, and Dice. Each character hits the ball in different angles and has their own jump heights and abilities that make each of them stand out from one another. You've got your basic 15 year old baseball player, all the way down to a cyborg crocodile that uses his tail to hit the ball and a robot with a skateboard!Gameplay: The gameplay in Lethal League is absolutely amazing. It is so fun making the ball go thousands of miles per hour and always wondering if you'll hit the ball, or be hit yourself! You have some options of hitting the ball, such as doing a downward smash that doubles the ball speed, or just hitting it straight forward to try to trick your opponent into thinking it'll go somewhere else. Characters fill up a four bar meter everytime they hit the ball, and when full they can use their special attack which can do things like make the ball travel through walls or just eat it and spit it back out! The fun in Lethal League is the simplicity of it, and while simple, it is incredibly fun and satisfying.Music: Music in any game is usually why I keep playing. Lethal League's soundtrack is some of the greatest in indie game music that I've heard. Team Reptile really hit it out of the park with this one, and there was not one single song I disliked in this title. The menu music alone is just phenomenal, and tracks like Ordinary Days and Scream just add to the awesomeness of it. They all loop pretty nicely and sound very well done. The soundtrack in Lethal League will surely not disappoint you at all!Graphics: Lethal League overall looks pretty good for an indie game. The art of the characters is pretty sweet, and so are the backgrounds of each stage. It's also amazing to look at the stages changes the faster you hit the ball, and I feel just makes it way more satisfying to reach insane speeds! The animations feel a bit clunky and weird though, but not something that I really payed much attention to. I will say though, if you want a headache then go ahead and play this game for hours, as it will probably hurt your eyes! Conclusion: I most likely missed some elements and whatnot but I really only wanted to touch on those three topics. That being said, this is a game you MUST play. I recommend it for everyone who loves fighting games and playing with friends. To have the best experience, please do grab some friends and enjoy the hell out of this game! You might not like the 14 dollar price on this game, and that is reasonable due to how simple the game is, but it is worth the money. If you can get some friends, then no doubt you'll be hitting homeruns in no time! Rating: 9/10			"

												What can only be described as a cross between pong and super smash brothers, this game is now in my top 3 of all time (and I don't just add and subtract games from my list on a whim). I reccomend everyone get this game.It seems simple at first, just hit the ball to your opponent with dodgeball-esqe rules, and the speed of the ball increases over time. 3 controls; hit, jump and bunt. What most people don't realise until they buy the game and play it for 10 minutes, is that this game has so much depth and strategy. You can perform combos to fill up your special meter, you can parry shots with presice timing to throw your opponent off guard, you can bunt the ball whilst travelling one million pixels per frame to surprise other players, you can blahdy blahdy blah. You get the picture.There are only 5 characters, and they seem to all be the same at first, but they all have different angles when hitting the ball and they can interact with the environment in different ways. These may seem suttle, but have a large effect on the gameplay. Each character has a special move unique to them also, and when used correctly, can have a devastating effect on your adversarys.What the hell are you doing. Stop reading this and buy the game so I have more people to play with.If you don't buy it, i'll murder you in your sleep. Tonight.			"

												Personally i think the game is fantastic to play with friends. I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play ""Walligator"" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank. all in all it's a good gamesolid sound tracka ""challenge"" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.art style isnt much at first but it grows on youminor connection issues in online multiplayerlocal multiplayer as well as onlineeasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)-basics  - swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]  - bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]        - once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground  - parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]  - slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)specials and traits-candyman  - ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again  - candyman has no heavy falling  - candyman has the sharpest slam angle - sonata  - special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points  - has a double jump - latch   - can climb walls   - largest hitbox   - special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught - switch   - can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)   - upward aim goes behind him   - special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter) - Raptor  - smallest hitbox  - can bunt if ball is above him  - fastest hit  - special hits the ball twice and can change the direction of the ball on release			"

It is worth the money. the only problem i had was connection problems but that was like once every 6 games and only one person would drop from a free for all. I recommend to get this game with a few freinds for a lot of laughs and good times. The contorls are easy to learn and the game is pretty straight forward. Hit your oppenent with the ball but the really good thing about this game is the time dialation when the ball breaks the sound barrier.  Definately a fun game to keep you occupied for awhile.			"

Gameplay is extremely nice and simple. It doesn't try to be very complicated, which is very good. I believe Team Reptile knew what they were doing with this game, for sure. It does not have many characters but more are expected to come along. For how much I like the characters, I think they are very cool.

												To start off. This game is defenitly different than your average 2D fighter. With a very simular aspect of a Super Smash Bros. game, It's A four-player game with a objective that's not beating up another player until their health gauge is gone. Instead your hitting a ball at intense velocities slowly creeping up in momentum until one of the players hits it back faster or is knocked out by the ball. This is where it gets insane. Each character, despite its low roster, has special abilities to either make the ball move faster or cause insane mix-ups on the other players. They all have simular properties to SSB characters: like fast falling, Dash Dancing, and floaties. The big thing that you need to learn in this game is not really the technical prowess, but learning the frames of the game, predicting where the balls is going to go, and timing every hit correctly. Aside from all this jibber jabber, this game offers minimal stuff to do aside from leveling up, unlocking skins, and comepleting a offline challange mode simular to a arcade mode of somesort. The online takes a while to  find any kind of matches including 1 on 1 or a free for all battle but I have yet to run into a  match where it's just miseriably laggy. If you want a hype, over the top, different 2d fighter game; play this, enjoy it with your friends or go online and smash some scrubs. I'd definintly recommend this game.			"

												I just found out that I had this game the other night by some crazy random chance. My brother pointed it out to me and claimed how much he wanted the game, so I figured I might as well install it and give it a whirl. And boy, am I glad I did. This game is like Super Smash Bros, plus Jet Set Radio Future, minus the graffiti, plus baseball and a lot of attitude. My first night playing, the game got me so hyper and hopped up on adrenaline, it was crazy. (Not to mention I was playing on the highest ball speed and four level 7 computers within five minutes of playing.)  The game is easy to learn, yet a little hard to master. (Took me about two hours to be able to hold my own against four level 7's, but that doesn't mean I'm able to beat them hands down.)I love the fact that it has local multiplayer capabilities, so my brother can join me while playing, until he gets his own copy of the game. It's best with a controller in my opinion, and my crappy laptop that gets 2 FPS at most while playing modern games can handle this game with no problem. Great soundtrack, too.The only downside I see with this game, is the fact that it gets repetitive after a few hours. I'd love a few new characters as well, but other than that, this game is amazing. Please play it, you won't regret it.			"

												How do I describe this game?.......Lethal leauge is how many peopke describe it, a mix between PONG and Super Smash Bros. The main idea is you and up to 3 other players hit a small ball that seems to lack gravity or air resistance inbetween each other. When you hit the ball it get's 'tagged' with your color, and if someone gets hit with the ball when it's not tagged their color they're out.There's a lot more to it than that, like stage sizes and hit angles, but if you want a fun little game you ca jump into whenever and mess around with friends, or compete in actual tournaments, this game is for you.It's also a very chaotic game, however. At times you and someone else will end up getting one of you out, then thinking 'What the hell just happened?' And usually it can be a bit jarrring, especially at higher ball speeds when the screen starts shaking and you have to factor in hit lag.Overall, I give this game a 10/10. Really. I have no complaints.			"

												Six characters, five maps of varying height and width, up to four players, match options, and palette swap unlocks. Lethal League is extremely fun in it's current state, however the developers seem to be of the mindset that what has been released is enough, and in my opinion, that is far from correct. More maps, more characters, and the option to add AI controlled bots to private matches is needed to keep the game interesting all around. It doesn't do anything amazing, but for the current price, and if you have at least one other friend to play with, it's well worth your time.			"

Smacking a ball around with your friends as it hits 1 million miles per hours sounds like absolute nonsense. But the combination of a great concept, percise movements, and colorful world make this a must have for game night! ONLY downside I can state is the lack of characters. Six truely isn't alot.

												This unique fighting game's goal is to hit the other player(s) with a ball. Sounds weird right? Well each time you hit the ball it speeds up going up to speeds of 1 million (I haven't even got to 100,000 nevermind 1,000,000) giving you so much satisfaction when you hit a ball with 1000 speed.This is a great multiplayer game which is quick and easy to find matches.Here's the free prototype if you're unsure: http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/ "

												Lethal League is like a glorified Pong with a Smash Bros. skin. The basic objective is to knock your opponent(s) out using a ball that you keep knocking back and forth in between each other. Sound simple, yeah? But the catch is the more the ball gets smacked around, the faster it goes. Soon enough it reaches insane speeds to where you can barely keep up with it. The enviornment even changes as the speed gets faster and faster.The game is played in ""Bursts"", or rounds, and the ball's speed resets every round. The use of bursts make every round very intense and heart-pounding when the ball reaches the incredible speeds. Dare I say you may even be on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is great, too. Definitely fitting for the game, having nice funky tunes with you. Take a listen sometime.The characters are pretty unique in their own right. They each have a distinct character design and personality that you can easily recognize. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. Also, each of them have special abilities that have different effects on the ball, such as Candyman's ability to make the ball phase through the walls.In short, Lethal League is a fast paced, blood pumping action fest that you'll surely get a kick out of. I highly recommend it.			"

												A great indie fighting game that combines the neutral game mechanics of 2d fighting games like street fighter and mortal combat, and the fun factor of the smash brothers series. Pros:A fun experience for people who enjoy fast paced, crazy fighting games.Relatively cheap, only $20 at the time of posting this.Great and helpful community.Cons:High skill ceiling, many people that are still playing have been for almost a year, and very good players with 400-500+ hours are usually going to be found in online matchmakingUnranked matchmaking, there's no ELO system of sorts, so you can play anyone from the range of a braindead squirrel, to a winner of 20 tournaments.Low player count in matchmaking, Lethal League usually does not have a high player count, and they're not always in online matchmaking, so you will sometimes keep matching up against someone you don't want to play against due to them being the only person online who you can play.Regardless, Lethal League is an incredibly fun and surprisingly complex fighting game, and if you're willing to put in the time and effort to get good, it can be a very self rewarding and fun experience.

												I found this really interesting game on YouTube, and it looked appealing. So I waited for a good sale, bought it, and just had a blast. When I first saw this game, I thought it was your average fighting game that you could land all the sweet combos with friends. But Lethal League is so much more than just a fighting game. With the only way to blast fighters out of the arena using a ball that is consitantly gaining speed, bouncing, flying, and who knows what in any direction, this game adds an intense factor in trying to stay alive.I remember when I had three friends over and we all had out own wired controllers, so I suggested we played Lethal League. I had already been playing a lot of it, and they had never played in their life. Now, when I thought playing alone was fun, I never accounted having friends to play with. But when more people joined the game, it becomes hilariously joyous, with a lot of tense moments of only two people left and the ball being at over 1000 speed, some people figuring out new attacks, or people getting that three-hit wipeout, mostly on accident.All in all, Lethal League is a sweat-inducing and creative game, bringing a fresh idea to the fighting game genre, and one that works incredibly well. The multiplayer works great, hit detection is fine, the characters are interesting, and the gameplay is just plain awesome.			"

Now this is a well-made party game.Sheet gets real man, this game is more fastpaced than trying to dodge the memes on 9gag when john cena came out. Trust me you do not want to be on a touhou in which John Cena participates. Not good for your mental health.Like, damn son, this is sick.Lethal League is an arena VS. in which you inflict damage only via ball. This just adds another layer of mindgames and cheeki breeki tactics.There are only 5 basic controls: move, jump, hit, ""bunt"" aka MINDGAMES (lob the ball for a very brief amount of time, goes back to whatever speed it was whenever it touches a surface else than ceiling), and of course, TAUNT.The ball gains speed by hitting it and it slows down by bunting it. But thing is, aerials *MULTIPLY* the ball's speed. Everything else just changes its speed by 1.When the ball's at high speeds it becomes a very intense dumbfest of epic.There are specials, by filling up a 4-stage gauge. Easy to do, and the specials are very dumb.Just with that, there's just a lot of tactics and tech shtuff you can come out with, characters have different perks, like double jump, faster weapon afterswing, more range, better lobs, more angle freedom on some moves...After all, it's addicting as all hell known and very fun to play. There's also a ""challenge"" mode (singleplayer arcade), which has a damn cool boss at the end.OST: Good, and very fitting.Character design: verry nice.Gameplay: Top Kek from Quebec. "

												If I were to sum up the game simply, I would say ""Imagine if Jet Set Radio and Street Fighter 3: Third Strike were one game, but instead of hitting each other, you were hitting balls.""However, I am not summing up this game (that) simply.Lethal League is definitely a must have game for anyone that is a fan of fast-paced action, hype, or good ol' fashion fun in general (so everyone). It's an easy game to pick up, but a difficult one to master, so practice makes perfect.Gameplay-wise, the game is pretty simple. Z is used to hit the ball, X is used to bunt, Space is jump, and A is ""expressions"", so each character's unique taunt, and A with a directional button will display a different phrase. The game is tight, and everything from moving to hitting the ball feels good. The more the ball is hit, the more energy is picks up, meaning each round, or ""burst"", picks up the pace as time goes on. Atmosphere wise, the game is slick. The graphics are phenomenal, and the music is amazing (hence the JSRxTS statement I made above). As well as playing great, LL looks and sounds great as well, with the voice acting and sound effects all on point as well.All in all, it's a great game that is definitely worth the cost. Multiplayer is fun too, and regular single player matches and the challenge/arcade mode are good practice for the real deal against other people.			"

												Fun and exciting to play, and to watch. While still being legitimately competetive. Lethal League is relatively bare, being a game about hitting a ball into dudes, with all the different buttons being different ways of hitting said ball, yet it is highly focused and concise.If you were one of those people who thought Divekick's bare-bones gameplay was quite a groundbreaking thing, but were bummed to discover the novelty wore off very quickly or otherwise never understood it in the first place, then maybe Lethal League will leave a better taste in your mouth. Even if you don't plan on playing it until you're one of the best ball-bunters online, you will be giddy with excitement everytime the ball accelerates to mach speeds and every strike is empowered with tense build-up. It is the most anime thing ever and it is great. (Disclaimer: This user does not personally invest in this application of the term ""anime"". Interpret loosely.)Here's to hoping Lethal League gets continued support, as well as sustained recognition.			"

												This unique fighting game's goal is to hit the other player(s) with a ball. Sounds weird right? Well each time you hit the ball it speeds up going up to speeds of 1 million (I haven't even got to 100,000 nevermind 1,000,000) giving you so much satisfaction when you hit a ball with 1000 speed.This is a great multiplayer game which is quick and easy to find matches.Here's the free prototype if you're unsure: http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/ "

There is a couple of things I would change or add such as editable color palletes and soundtrack (which is already decent), the ability to browse through host games, and a larger character roster (since they added Dice im assuming they plan to add more in the future).

												If I were to sum up the game simply, I would say ""Imagine if Jet Set Radio and Street Fighter 3: Third Strike were one game, but instead of hitting each other, you were hitting balls.""However, I am not summing up this game (that) simply.Lethal League is definitely a must have game for anyone that is a fan of fast-paced action, hype, or good ol' fashion fun in general (so everyone). It's an easy game to pick up, but a difficult one to master, so practice makes perfect.Gameplay-wise, the game is pretty simple. Z is used to hit the ball, X is used to bunt, Space is jump, and A is ""expressions"", so each character's unique taunt, and A with a directional button will display a different phrase. The game is tight, and everything from moving to hitting the ball feels good. The more the ball is hit, the more energy is picks up, meaning each round, or ""burst"", picks up the pace as time goes on. Atmosphere wise, the game is slick. The graphics are phenomenal, and the music is amazing (hence the JSRxTS statement I made above). As well as playing great, LL looks and sounds great as well, with the voice acting and sound effects all on point as well.All in all, it's a great game that is definitely worth the cost. Multiplayer is fun too, and regular single player matches and the challenge/arcade mode are good practice for the real deal against other people.			"

												Fun and exciting to play, and to watch. While still being legitimately competetive. Lethal League is relatively bare, being a game about hitting a ball into dudes, with all the different buttons being different ways of hitting said ball, yet it is highly focused and concise.If you were one of those people who thought Divekick's bare-bones gameplay was quite a groundbreaking thing, but were bummed to discover the novelty wore off very quickly or otherwise never understood it in the first place, then maybe Lethal League will leave a better taste in your mouth. Even if you don't plan on playing it until you're one of the best ball-bunters online, you will be giddy with excitement everytime the ball accelerates to mach speeds and every strike is empowered with tense build-up. It is the most anime thing ever and it is great. (Disclaimer: This user does not personally invest in this application of the term ""anime"". Interpret loosely.)Here's to hoping Lethal League gets continued support, as well as sustained recognition.			"

												Date: 2/4/16Review Number: 9Game: Lethal LeagueFrom (Creator Publisher): Team ReptilePlayed On: Steambox (Steam Controller)Steam Price as of Review: $13.99Total Time played: 45 MinutesReview:Admittedly, this is not a game that has come up on the randomizer.  In fact, I think I have decided that once every nine or ten days I think I am going to play a game of my own choosing, in order to balance out the reviews, and to keep me from going crazy.  So I figure the best way to start off my ‘player’s choice’ series would be Lethal League, a multiplayer smash fest from Team Reptile.  Now, I admitted earlier that I really wasn’t that big on fighting games, and in fact often just pounded the controller like I was asking for another beer at a crowded bar hoping the other guy walked into my punches.  I confess now that there was one unmentioned exception to that statement, and that was the classic Nintendo 64 version of smash brothers.  I actually spent a significant amount of time refining my skill in that game, partially because it was a fighting game I was actually fairly decent at, but more because it was oodles of fun, and a great game to play with friends.Fast forward a decade and change, and we have Lethal League, which is a rehashing of the typical multiplayer chaos on the screen everyone pounding controllers while jumping up and down and ‘accidentally’ kicking each other while playing sort of game, only this time with the added fun of dodgeball rules added in.  See, instead of simply smashing each other directly, players instead knock a little color coded ball back and forth with the goal of hitting someone else, knocking them out until the next serve.  Difficulty is added as the ball’s speed increases every time it is hit, giving players a reward for timing over button mashing.  Each character even has their own special move, from Dice’s occasional arcing of the ball over everyone's’ heads to candyman’s wall-looping trick, each character has a way to frustrate everyone else playing.  And with both online and local multiplayer modes possible, this game will give you enough play value to make it worth any amount of money, and eventual frustration over whoever picks Latch.  Can’t recommend this one enough, folks.  Have fun!Game’s Fate: Kept.  Also installed on the laptop.  Never know when you want another roundBuy/No Buy: Buy.  Heck, Buy a multipack and send it to all your friends.			"

												TLDR: This game is great fun, try it out! Especially fun with a few friends of similar level, but honsetly the AI is pretty decent.  The AI is pretty ball- breaking on high difficulty, pun intended.The music, atmosphere and visuals of the game gel together really well to make a damn cool experience. The game is good when you are just learning, and when you have mastered the mechanics. All around great stuff "

												Based on the time I've played so far I have to say that it's entertaining to play by yourself, and with friends it's absolutely hilarious. This to me is sort of a mixture between the classic game Pong and the Super Smash Bros series.The idea of making a fighting game where you don't hit each other but instead shoot a projectile at your opponents is something I personally haven't seen before.If I were to complain about something, it would be that the game should have more playable characters and more maps to play on. The game has a lot of potential but kind of falls on the lack of updates.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a good laugh.Also, NEVER underestimate the speed of a ball.			"

												short version: worth the buylong-ish version: great multiplayer game that brings smash bros to mind in it's relatively simple yet chaotic gameplay. the kind of game thats easy to learn and hard to master. characters skills leave a nice twist on the gameplay. awesome soundtrack. art is pretty neat, especially when the ball really gets moving. leveling system unlocks skins, which is nice, but nothing game changhing, obviously. overall just a pretty fun game for fighting game fans looking for something new and different, but i doubt that it would ever be played hardcore mlg like street fighter or tekken. one thing to note, however, is that i DID buy this with 2 friends, so i've been playing with them pretty exclusively; if/when i get around to trying more of the single player or trying random multiplayer i'll update the review, but i wouldn't count on it since i'll probably forget/am incredibly lazy.solid 8/10.

												Great game, deserves a reward.The game is a strange competitive game, you try to hit the enemy with the ball you hit, each hit increases the speed making it somewhat challenging to hit the ball and satisfying when you hit it.The music is great for each map, the art style is awesome, brings me back to the good old Jet Set Radio art vibe and all around beautiful.The characters are not serious, making the competitive aspect of the game less fustrating as you feel like you're having fun. When you die you know what happened to you and you just want to improve from it, it's one of the main things what I love about lethal league.7/10Reason why I give it a 7/10 is because it lacks communication to the community, yeah, there's almost like an update almost every month or two, but, I mean, with the newer games these days, developers normally make blogs about what's going on. Fan art and things like that, I'd really love to see some from Lethal League.			"

												For the love of all that is holy, don't get this game unless you want to lose any semblance of friendship you ever had in your life. I beg you, do not smack balls at speeds that put the sonic boom to shame into your friends' collective faces. I beseech you, do not bunt the ball out of their reach just to strike it into the earth and then bunt it for a special. I can only hope you don't taunt after every win that leaves craters in the ground, walls, and ceiling.For the love of God, only get this game if you hate happiness and companionship.

												My favorite local multiplayer / casual fighter game on the market, as I write this.It's simple enough for new players to pick it up and actually have fun immediately, with enough depth and split-second timing to keep things fresh. The mechanics are elegant and well-considered (unlike Divekick), there's some thoughtfulness to the action (more than Samurai Gunn), it's easy to see what's going on, and fun for any level of play (the bad part of Towerfall), and doesn't lend itself to standoffs or ever get slow (Nidhogg). The music is great. It looks bad, but don't let that stop you. Netplay is fairly good (!). My favorite local multiplayer competitive game of 2014.			"

												What can only be described as a cross between pong and super smash brothers, this game is now in my top 3 of all time (and I don't just add and subtract games from my list on a whim). I reccomend everyone get this game.It seems simple at first, just hit the ball to your opponent with dodgeball-esqe rules, and the speed of the ball increases over time. 3 controls; hit, jump and bunt. What most people don't realise until they buy the game and play it for 10 minutes, is that this game has so much depth and strategy. You can perform combos to fill up your special meter, you can parry shots with presice timing to throw your opponent off guard, you can bunt the ball whilst travelling one million pixels per frame to surprise other players, you can blahdy blahdy blah. You get the picture.There are only 5 characters, and they seem to all be the same at first, but they all have different angles when hitting the ball and they can interact with the environment in different ways. These may seem suttle, but have a large effect on the gameplay. Each character has a special move unique to them also, and when used correctly, can have a devastating effect on your adversarys.What the hell are you doing. Stop reading this and buy the game so I have more people to play with.If you don't buy it, i'll murder you in your sleep. Tonight.			"

												I found this really interesting game on YouTube, and it looked appealing. So I waited for a good sale, bought it, and just had a blast. When I first saw this game, I thought it was your average fighting game that you could land all the sweet combos with friends. But Lethal League is so much more than just a fighting game. With the only way to blast fighters out of the arena using a ball that is consitantly gaining speed, bouncing, flying, and who knows what in any direction, this game adds an intense factor in trying to stay alive.I remember when I had three friends over and we all had out own wired controllers, so I suggested we played Lethal League. I had already been playing a lot of it, and they had never played in their life. Now, when I thought playing alone was fun, I never accounted having friends to play with. But when more people joined the game, it becomes hilariously joyous, with a lot of tense moments of only two people left and the ball being at over 1000 speed, some people figuring out new attacks, or people getting that three-hit wipeout, mostly on accident.All in all, Lethal League is a sweat-inducing and creative game, bringing a fresh idea to the fighting game genre, and one that works incredibly well. The multiplayer works great, hit detection is fine, the characters are interesting, and the gameplay is just plain awesome.			"

Now this is a well-made party game.Sheet gets real man, this game is more fastpaced than trying to dodge the memes on 9gag when john cena came out. Trust me you do not want to be on a touhou in which John Cena participates. Not good for your mental health.Like, damn son, this is sick.Lethal League is an arena VS. in which you inflict damage only via ball. This just adds another layer of mindgames and cheeki breeki tactics.There are only 5 basic controls: move, jump, hit, ""bunt"" aka MINDGAMES (lob the ball for a very brief amount of time, goes back to whatever speed it was whenever it touches a surface else than ceiling), and of course, TAUNT.The ball gains speed by hitting it and it slows down by bunting it. But thing is, aerials *MULTIPLY* the ball's speed. Everything else just changes its speed by 1.When the ball's at high speeds it becomes a very intense dumbfest of epic.There are specials, by filling up a 4-stage gauge. Easy to do, and the specials are very dumb.Just with that, there's just a lot of tactics and tech shtuff you can come out with, characters have different perks, like double jump, faster weapon afterswing, more range, better lobs, more angle freedom on some moves...After all, it's addicting as all hell known and very fun to play. There's also a ""challenge"" mode (singleplayer arcade), which has a damn cool boss at the end.OST: Good, and very fitting.Character design: verry nice.Gameplay: Top Kek from Quebec. "

												Lethal League is an fun  game with simplicity. It takes a while to get used to it controls, if you have a controller it's a tad easier. Once you start out you'll be walking around aimlessly without knowing what to do. After a few matches you'll grasp how to move and the timing of the ball. After about an hour you'll be a pro practically. Knowing the exact patterns and timings of the ball, getting it up into the 10,000s. The game is extremely fast paced at that point. The music in this game is rythymically amusing and the secenery is good enough that it provides a good amount of stuff in the background. 10/10			"

												Do you like fighting games? Do you like fighting games that have nothing to do with fighting?Lethal league is an amazing skill-based game. The idea is to take out your opponents by hitting them with a ball which speeds up to insane velocities. It gets to the point where you just can't see the ball and react with enough time, you must figure out where it's going and time your hit correctly. The game has multiple characters, each with their own abilities, movement characteristics and angles at which they respond the ball which keeps the matches varied. The music is good, but the art is amazing. The scenary and the colours change as a match gets more hectic. There are also a couple of play modes. Death mach, team death match and some goalkeeping game. The only problem is that sometimes finding a match takes a while.I fully recommend this game. I totally love it.			"

												""Lethal League is a competitive projectile fighting game where you have to hit an anti-gravity ball into the face of your opponent to win."" That description is spot. Lethal League is a ton of fun though. Once you got used to how the game works the ridiculous amount of things that can happen are endless. The game offers three different game modes; free for all, team, and strikers. Free for all is exactually what you would expect up to for people all trying to knock eachother out by hitting the ball. Team is the same way other than being able to work with your teammate to control the pace of the game. Stirikers is basically soccer where each team is trying to hit the ball into the other teams goal while also trying to protect your own. For free for all I would reccomend three people because with four people the game gets to hectic for me personally. Also the soundtrack in this game is sweet! Overall though I would highly recommend this game to anyone as long as you have friends to play with. I would give this game a solid 8/10 with the only thing holding it back being the replay value since it relies so much on one type of gameplay some people may get bored fairly quickly.			"

												What can I say about this gem?Well I can say this; this game is the most fun I've had with a multiplayer game. Playing this game with friends is an awesome and frantic experience. Equally I just enjoyed batting it about with the CPUs when I bought the game the day after I played it at a friends. My one suggestion to the developer is to add some custom features (like changing the default ball speed or the gravity) and some other modes would be cool (tag team matches or something)Probably one of the best examples of a good indie game. The soundtrack is mind meltingly good, the thick electro and trance providing the perfect backdrop for a flawless game. The controls feel good. The sound design has that great new retro feel - evoking sweet sweet tones of Jet Set Radio. Rarely has the word eargasm been so applicable. The voice acting has that cool 90s feel - ""WIIIIIIIIPEEEE OUUUUT""If you want to buy any party game, or a game for just chilling with or a game that is just plain amazing. Then buy this. A nice change from boring bland  brown survival games that seem to be churning out from some early access hell hole. This game deserves your money and it deserves to be on every platform available - probably even the NeoGeo			"

The REAL game of baseball. In honesty it's a really fun, quick party game that is amazing to play sauced out of your gourd, or as just a quick stress relief.

												Lethal League is one of the most original fighters I've played in a while to the point where I'm not even sure if it could be called a fighter. But, its lack of content (especially in the singleplayer front) makes this game only worth it for a few laughs with friends.The story is non-existent in this game, but the characters you get to play as and the stages you play in are really interesting and have a very unique style reminiscent of something like Jet Set Radio. The world presented in the stages looks very interesting but you never get to explore it or get to know more about it. Nevertheless, they make for a good visualizer inbetween rounds for this game's excellent soundtrack.The gameplay revolves around a ball which you hit to make it turn your color which means that any players hit who aren't the same color (assuming you're in a team battle) die instantly. They can hit it again though and make it go faster and faster and faster until someone is hit. This game is so simple yet so mind numbingly complex in its mechanics that it welcomes players from any skill level. Casually, this is a fun game to play with up to 3 friends. Competitively, this is a game riddled with mechanics to be discovered and tactics to be used. This is the perfect balance for any fighter.But then there's that. This isn't quite a fighter... This is more like ""Super Pong Bros."" in a way. But unlike the Nintendo money machine, this game isn't riddled with content, unlockables or anything really to make for a solid singleplayer experience. This game's only content as far as I'm concerned is playing with friends and to some extent online play. It's unusual mechanics don't really make it pro tournament and competitive play material, although I could see it entirely.In the end, Lethal League's mechanics more than make up for the lack of content, and while its visual aesthetic can be called archaic for some, it can be seen as artistic. The diversity in the very small roster of characters is there, albeit not too game changing since the only change is usually only the special attack that can be used after 4 successful hits on the ball. Skins and trophies are there for a singleplayer experience, but... I wouldn't advise you playing this game unless at least one friend would play with you as well.Worth checking out.			"

This game is another game that can be added to your couch co-op game collection. Invites some friends over, and knock the crap out of them with baseball.The game is crazy fun. it relies on timing, and good use of your characters special move(each character has a unique special). if timed correctly, you can be hitting the ball back and forth as it goes 10,000 mph or more.

												This game is fantastic. Behind it's deceptively simple premise lays a large amount of depth for an indie competitive multiplayer game. Whether you're looking for a good game to play with friends, or something to practice and learn, it's well worth the $14 price tag. Anyone that is dismissing this thinking it's just a port of a flash game, think again, since this is quite the gem.			"

This game suffers from the occasional disconnection and did i mention we are all really well endowed! Quite a sight to behold! This game also has very captivating scenery and effects but, we cannot enjoy it to its fullest ourselves because we are too busy with admiring our own well endowed god given rods as they too have a great scenery and effects.Edit: We, The Well Endowed Friends, have come to a fork in our roads. We seem to be having difficulty deciding who is the most well endowed therefore, we have decided to hold a Godly Rod Fight to settle our differences.			"

												Lethal League knocks it out of the park, without even trying. The mechanics to this fighter are straightforward and very easy to understand. Two to four characters hit a baseball around an arena, trying to hit the other players with it. If a player hits the ball back, the speed of the ball increases. You can “bunt” the ball, temporarily knocking it straight up, but once it’s hit again or touches the ground it will resume its previous velocity. If a player manages to hit the ball four times, they can do a special move that varies by character.It sounds simplistic on paper, but the ball velocity gets so high that your only view of it is as a straight line bisection the arena. Timing is critical, strategy vital, and seat-of-your-pants tactics (wild panic works too) all combine into a high-octane fight unlike anything I’ve seen before. In a very strange, oblique way, it reminds me of high-level play in Rockstar’s Table Tennis. Lethal League has even replaced Soul Calibur as my favorite fighting game.If you’re curious about the game, you can play the original prototype of Lethal League here: http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/ - it’s not quite the same as the full game, but it’s enough to give you a good impression.

												Lethal League is one of the most fun games I've ever played.First, It's got one of the best GGPO connections out there. I can play with my friends even when the family is destroying my internet connection with streams and netflix.It's Pong, but you control a character and smash the ball against your opponent, until the ball goes so fast it breaks the universe and one of you takes it to the face. Not only that, but Lethal League has a 4 player feature, making it even more chaotic. Packed with a Artstyle that will probably remind you of Jet Set Radio, it also has one of the best soundtracks out there. It's 10/10 on anyone's list, I'm sure.What are you waiting for? go buy it and play with your friends! You'll have a lot of fun.			"

												I'm not gonna say if I reccomend this game or not, even though i'll label it as not. As I see no reason to purchase it at its current state.I mean... It's alot of fun and all... for the first 12 hours.Then you realise you've done everything you could possible do...I do enjoy modding this game with custom textures, as it's easy af to do....BUT online is dead. And everything is more or less the same...I feel this game is a more advanced version of determining who rolls dice first in monopoly, A game i use to makes decisions like ""rock, paper, scissors""			"

I am horrible at reviewing games due to me being somewhat of a moron, but this game is so simple to play, that even people who are not fans of traditional fighters (Myself included) will absolutely love it's simple but challenging to master gameplay.

If you like fighting games at all, and remember the hype of the UFGT 9 Finals match, then you really should try Lethal League in its Steam form. The music is extremely bangin', and you can easily find the tracks in the music folder, to rock out to whenever. No weak ****. No complex move lists. No johns. Just insane, adrenaline-pumping, lethal and unadulterated madness.Just play it. The price is well worth it.			"

												You hit a ball, change its colour and this way the ball can KO your opponent. When he gets hit a number of times, you win.The premise is interesting but gets old quickly. Changing the direction of the ball when hitting it is difficult because of the controls (you can direct the ball with up and down keys and you jump with another key). This game would be easier to play with keyboard plus mouse, using the mouse to direct the ball. It would also be easier to jump using the up key instead of a separate jump bind.Music is decent. Graphics are so so. Characters don't seem to have any story about them and instead of a Story Mode you have a Challenge Mode which for some reason is in a secondary menu. I think that, given the simple gameplay, there should be some other play modes to keep up your interest. Specially for single player.It can be fun to play with other people on same screen. It seems there are not many players left for online multiplayer games.			"

												I`m not sure where to begin, The intensity in this game and the thrill are so real, even though it could look like a normal game, yet if you try it and played it with some friends you will notice that you are slowly getting addicted to it, Each character has some abilities and special move, each of them has a characteristic and a personality acting according to their own, I`m honestly surprised not many of my friends had this game yet.It`s a total recommended, like hell worth every penny.

												Now before I start, this is not a bad game. But even though it's playable alone, multiplayer is practically a requirement for this game to be worth it. The Challenge mode ranges from unduly hard to boringly easy. Sometimes, you'll never get the ball speed over 50MPH, other times, the CPU you took out with a lame 40MPH ball will deflect your 250MPH shot with a single frame of notice. The AI is inconsistent and doesn't prepare you for multiplayer play at all, because they do not behave like normal humans. Some will charge you and stay on top of you when it's the least safe situation to do so, just so they can hit the ball where you have a single frame to react. Others will bunt the ball repeatedly on one side of the arena for no discernible reason. You would think there would be enough people around to pick and play random people online, but no amount of waiting eve seems to get me to find another person. So what does that mean? It means you're only going to be able to play this game with people you expressly invite to play with you. And at a $14-$40 price tag to get everyone equipped with their own copy of the game, it's not worth what will probably be a half hour session. Or less. With only six characters to choose from, there's very little replay value in the same session, let alone over multiple ones, so like many other Steam games that fill a super specific niche, get this one on sale. And get some for your friends too, because you're going to need them if you plan to have any fun with this game.			"

It has online problems. sometimes if you can't connect with other players the game will crash all together, but the game boots up extremely fast.This game however, is an absolute blast to play. Super easy controls, great music, cool characters (Candyman especially), nice visuals that are easy on the eyes even though the game is batshit insanely fast. While it may not have a lot to offer, it offers a ton of replayability.Easily recommended.TL;DR Alright online, but fun as ♥♥♥♥.			"

There is alot of screaming and shouting and laughing. Lots of twitching. Great fun.

												I can finally tell my friends I play League.... Oh, right. I'm writing a review. Here's my pros and cons list if you don't want to read the rest of my review.Pros:
 Fast-paced high-intensity gameplay that only increases in speed and intensity as the match goes on Beginner-friendly with an optional tutorial that can be replayed as many times as needed, as well as a practice mode 6 characters to choose from with unlockable character colors the more you play Online and local multiplayer supports up to 4 players Free-for-all and Team Battle game modes Single player campaign mode available (and achievements for beating it with each character) Gameplay is fluent and customizable with either keyboard or controller, controlled with 3 buttons outside the four directional movement buttons Amazing Soundtrack (at least, I think so)Cons: Lethal League online translates to Lethal Lag; I'd recommend not playing online if you and your friends do not have a fast and reliable internet connection Not much variety in terms of content; the single player campaign is just a series of battles against CPU opponents. Depending on your musical tastes, you might not like the soundtrack. This can always be remedied by adjusting the in-game volume settings and playing your own music over the game. The long version of the review If I was to describe Lethal League in one sentence, it would be Baseball Combat. You play as one of 6 characters, each with a different ability, and you hit the ball back and forth until it hits someone. When you get hit by the ball, you lose a life; when you lose all your lives, you've lost the match. I should note that hitting other characters directly does absolutely nothing, so you have to focus on hitting the ball such that it collides with your opponent. Up to 4 players can play at once, and the game modes include a free-for-all deathmatch as well as a team battle mode which supports both 2vs2, 1vs2 and 1vs3 modes. Friendly fire is optional (referred in-game as ball tagging) to allow a more intense experience should you choose to play with it. This game is very keyboard friendly if you don't have a controller (as I don't have a very good controller); controlled with the directional arrow keys for movement and the Z, X and Spacebar for other movements, you can re-map all the controls as you see fit in the options menu. My friend can confirm that this game plays great with a controller as well.Where I think this game shines brightest is its multiplayer, especially when playing with friends. With friends, regardless of how much I was winning or losing, not a moment went by where we weren't having the time of our lives. This game is very easy to learn as the controls are limited to movement, jumping, hitting the ball and bunting the ball (hitting it lightly), and the optional replayable in-game tutorial explains things sufficiently. Overall, this game is best played with friends, but can be played just as well solo. Definitely recommended, especially if it's on sale.			"

												I am one of the well endowed firends mention in an earler review, and I would like to add that I am the most endowed of the aforementioned. We are having a lot of fun with this game and would like other well endowed people to join in on all the fun. If you aren't as well endowed as us you may not find as much fun out of the game. It does have a few techincal issues including but not limited to disconnects,crashing and freezing on character select all issues our well endowed rods do not share.			"

For how simple the controls are, there's a surprising amount of strategy that factors in. Timing is huge as well. Worth a buy for sure.

												This game is really fun. If it weren't for youtube I would;ve never found this game. I love the uniqueness of this game from its characters to game design. There's only one problem with the game is it's multiplayer. It tends to not even connect to online matches or sometimes it's really laggy even when searching with close range. Other than that, it's one of my favorite games. But I hope the developers fix this multiplayer issue quick.			"

The character design is a bit uninspired, and the animation at points is a bit less than what you would expect, but all that doesn't really matter when you're having such a brilliant time.There's future content on the way as well, so I would definitely recommend picking this up, especially during a sale.

												tl;dr: buy this game.  Heck, buy the four-pack and get some friends in on the action.  You'll have a blast.This game is an odd mashup of things like Tekken, Super Smash Bros, Pong, and a bit of Dragonball Z mixed in for good measure.  If you get a couple of friends and all play together, this game is one of the best times you'll collectively have.  I haven't played in the open multiplayer so I can't vouch for the online community, but playing against friends is simply fantastic.  The online multiplayer will occasionally desyncronize when starting a match, but it only takes about 10 seconds to exit the game, restart it, host a new lobby, invite your friends into it, and restart.  The desync error also is not particularly common, certainly less than 10% of matches will have this issue.  Not a serious detraction from the overall game.There are, however, two things missing: a replay system and a spectator mode.  There are many situations where it would be nice to have a replay so you can answer questions like ""How did that shot hit me?"" or ""That was an awesome move, can I see that again?""  I hope the devs will eventually include some form of replay management.  The inclusion of a spectator mode would make this game viable for some tournaments and casting.  I doubt it'll rival things like LoL or DOTA for popularity, but at some events it would be great to have a Lethal League tournament going on as a side-attraction or something.			"

												This is one of the most simplistic, yet fascinating fighting games I've seen since Divekick. The game behaves as a sort of combination of Super Smash Bros and Pong, and can get pretty over-the-top very quickly. The characters are unique enough to make them stand out from one another, but similar enough that they are all easy to get the hang of. The one real problem I would say I have is the lack of these characters: Only 6 in total.			"

												Initial impressions. Very addictive! I regretted buying it at first, no idea why. Totally fun. I'd have to say it's 1 part luck, 9 parts skill. For how simple the controls are, there's a surprising amount of strategy that factors in. Timing is huge as well. Worth a buy for sure. Online matches are fun as hell, and every character handles differently, in major and subtle ways.If you like fighters, but want a simpler alternative to all the combos, this is fun to pick up and play.

												I learned about this game from Star_ and Jerma985 -big shock- and although I haven't played too much it's quite a fun game. Not something one would play primarily but a damn good time-killer and doesn't require a very good computer. I'd recommend it if you enjoy semi-competitive games -esp. with friends- that requires reaction speed rather than mashing one button repeatedly.			"

												I don't remember how I was introduced to the prototype, but I shared it with my housemates and we've played hours worth of games over the course of the last six months. The simplicity, the visceral feedback, and the mindgames are what really make this game special. You can learn all the mechanics there is to learn in about 2 minutes, but what really takes a long time is learning how to read your opponent, what they're going to do and how to prepare for you. TotalBiscuit criticised the art style, but I have to disagree with him - The Boombox culture of south central los Angeles personified in cartoon form is a really fresh direction for a game to take. Maybe the palette has been exaggerated and might be a bit noisy, but I'll be damned if every single hit, every single return of the ball with the little flash particle animations isn't an instant dopamine hit.TL;Dr - simple game with a lot of strategic depth, great music, fresh art, solid mechanics. Recommend to everybody, I hope the guys at Reptile make millions of dollars.			"

												So this game is only just released today, and you might think, ""How can he write a review so early after release?""Valid arguement, but counterable with: the game is super short and super simple. I am not an expert at this game, far from it. But the games' mechanics are very easy to learn, infact the tutorial is ~2 minutes long. That being said, I am going to continue playing this game for quite a while, it feels absolutely WONDERFUL to smack the ball around, especially the faster it gets, and you start shouting at the screen to get it.The price point is imo too high, 14 isn't pocket change, considering how much the game actually has inside. I got super hyped and bought it anyway, but that decision is up to you.The online connection is phenomenal, very very few cases when it felt off or jumpy. If I didn't know I was alone, I couldn't tell that the players weren't right next to me. One big probelem though is that if it desyncs, then it's just about over for that room. But i've only had that happen once in the ~16 games I've played as of writing this.Now, if they added Local Play, this game would be completely worth the price, hopefully they add that feature. If you're worried about dumping the cash to pick this up, wait till it goes on sale. Even 10 would be good imo, but I also thought 14 was an acceptable loss			"

												This game is as if Jet Set Radio, Pong, and Baseball had a super-baby and somehow incorporated crocodiles into it. It's a fast-paced arcade-style game with catchy music and competitive gameplay, and it's extremely fun with friends. If this doesn't sway you, I don't know what will. Then again, I'm not a very persuasive writer... but I digress.Sadly, it doesn't have much singleplayer aspects to it and the multiplayer can be repetitive against people you already know. I wish there was more of a community to it, it'd be a shame if the whole MNC incident happened to this.			"

												If you have experienced the joys of life, you have most definitely played Lethal League. What's that? You haven't? That's simply not true, you either experienced it in an alternate universe which is now bleeding into ours, or simply didn't realize it. Everybody has played Lethal League, you know Beethoven? Yeah, he played this game. Mained Sonata too. But really play Lethal League, it's fast, energetic, has a great art style, good music, and is just really fun to play! "

												Like a good sequel should,  Call of Duty: Ghosts  Lethal League doesn’t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It’s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.Despite sharing a name with one of  Modern Warfare’s  Lethal League best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S.The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten – not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It’s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you’ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and – in the case of the space and water missions – special consideration for verticality and physics.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation’s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It’s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling — it's more about dumb fun — and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he’s a member of the Ghosts. And then there’s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.The Verdict Call of Duty: Ghosts  Lethal League isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula. Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makes  Ghosts  Lethal League one of the best Call of Duty games to date.

												This game is a nice twist of fighting and dodgeball. The gameplay is simple, you hit the ball it goes faster, if you hit your opponent, they lose a life. And even though the controls may be minimal, there are a lot of complex combos you can pull off with the ball.If you have no friends to play with, no worries! There are 2 (3 if you count training) SinglePlayer gamemodes to try out by yourself.This game is fun to play with your friends, or a fun way to chillax on your own.Cons:-Buggy-Online is Laggy-Menus do not have the ""life"" they deserve-Minimal character choice-Random seems rigged, if two or more people choose random, they will usually always be the same character (not 100% proven)- Final Rating: 88/100 -			"

Was a terrible joke. But really the game is worth picking up. Havent had this much fun playing a game in a while. Screaming at my screen at times getting so hype, amazed at the returns back and forth.  Easy to learn hard to master mechanics with complex tricks and traps to practice. As far as I've seen online is clean as hell with only the rare DC here and there. It would have to be to support the insane speeds the game can reach matched with the reaction times it takes to return the ball. The price is a little high but well worth for the pure fun of the game. Pick it up take a swing at it...sorry ill stop.			"

												The core game here is quite fun, but the online play has been nothing but laggy for me.  In fairness it's not comparatively that much lag - but anything about 200ms delay in game where the target can move across the entire screen in 2 frames basically makes it unplayable.  But if you get people locally, I think there's a lot of fun to be had here.			"

												This game is a nice twist of fighting and dodgeball. The gameplay is simple, you hit the ball it goes faster, if you hit your opponent, they lose a life. And even though the controls may be minimal, there are a lot of complex combos you can pull off with the ball.If you have no friends to play with, no worries! There are 2 (3 if you count training) SinglePlayer gamemodes to try out by yourself.This game is fun to play with your friends, or a fun way to chillax on your own.Cons:-Buggy-Online is Laggy-Menus do not have the ""life"" they deserve-Minimal character choice-Random seems rigged, if two or more people choose random, they will usually always be the same character (not 100% proven)- Final Rating: 88/100 -			"

												So you like Super Smash Bros? Ofc you do.You like skating robots fighting aligators? Again, ofc you do.And you like balls? I mean who doesnt?Well look no further. This game have it all.High speed balls, fancy outplays, derps and so much more. This game is great.Play it vs a friend and show him why you are the master of ball handling. Play with more and let the chaos unfold.The game itself is very simple and easy to play, but the skill ceiling is very high. And though you fight in a square box the game picks up speed so fast that even The Flash is like ""Daymn!""Get this game NOW!Im sitting here wondering why you are still reading this when you could have bought the game and started playing by now.

												If you like big party games like Smash Bros or fighting games in general, you will love Lethal League. It is FREAKIN AWESOME!The game gets really intense if someone doesn't lose a stock. That is because the ball gets closer to the speed beyond the naked eye. I have been following this game since the prototype. Whenever I get into nightmare mode where the screen color changes, the adrenaline is running (Because somebody has to go and it's not gonna be me!). I just wish more people wouldn't be hogging the wall and smashing the ball from there for the whole time. It sometimes works but it is very cheap. So guys, come online more often and let's play ball.			"

												Pong Fighter is the simple description of lethal league, a cool new games from Team Reptile makers of megabyte punch another suto fighting game. lethal league is simple to learn  but at its core it has a very high skill level. Only 3 buttons jump, strike, and punt but using good timing and learning angels with these tools you will be striking your opponent out while you're running home on a Grand Slam R.B.I.heres my full written review Lethal league is a game where the hype never stops  and neither does the ball. the core game is like combat pong  or dodge ball but there is a lot of nuance moves and tricks the make this game competitive and really fun.play with your friends. even if you don't have any, GO ONLINE and play against some other online warriors, don't want to get rekt. the challenge mode will keep you busy the fun never stops with a myriad of different stages and retro music that will remind you of jet set radio- always a good thing. the game is by team reptile the same people behind megabyte punch which came out august of 2013.after making megabyte punch the games developers were showing off a new kind of fighting game at major competitions the game was praised and so lethal league was born.the gameplay of lethal league is simple you can't really do much you can jump strike and punt. only 3 buttons but the maneuvers you can string together using these 3 buttons are essential to mastering the game. each one of your moves jump, strike, and  punt all have a different functionality depending on the situation and character.each character has a unique jump mechanic such as wall jump double jump ect. all characters have a downward strike will jumping. and all characters have a special move after hitting something 4 times.there are 5 characters so far. switch,raptor,sonata,candyman and latch. learning your characters move set, mobility, and strengths is key to knowing what to do in each situation and really adds depth to the game. my 2 favorite character so far are switch and sonta, switch  can ride on the walls and has a pretty horizontal swing. on the other hand sonata has a double jump and had a pretty vertical swing . each character differences do add some subtly to the game and doesn't change the core gameplay. unlike other fighting game where u have to know each character's inputs and timing this game is all about timing so u can hope on any character pretty much and still be competent. the moment to moment gameplay can look a little daunting to new players but the simple mechanics make it easy to hop in the game and just play and once you start to learn how to predict the ball then thats when you'll really get into the deep nuance  of this game. the developers did a good job of showing you the basic of the gameplay in their tutorial while still giving you the opportunity to discover new game mechanics on your own. overall the gameplay is simple yet hard to master and thats what u want ina competitive game getting into a game online is really easy its been a good number of people playing everytime i how on must i had to wait for a game was 1-2 minutes but most happen withen 30 secs. im on the west coast so your milage may vary the gameplay is great and all but what i think really deserves praise is the music and art tim and dion did a great job with a game art the style of the art really fits the game a sorta pixel art of future streetscapes and urban environments really adds to the feel of the games atmosphere the music gets me pumped to play so lethal league. i can listen to the music without the game. thats the sign of good music. a sorta mix sounds like the music for the jet set series with a modern twist  im having fun with lethal league and even though it won't be my go to competitive game i'm glad i have it in my library and i can hop in anytime and play the best version of pong there is :D7/10slightly abouve wolfstien the new oder Video Impressions

												Hitting the ball back and forth has never been so much fun! It sounds simple enough, but you have to time your hits.. just right, and online play can be a bit rough. It does seem to be pretty active, even late at night with online play. Log on at 1AM find a match, during the day, find a match, so on and so forth. Downside to this game is it allows people that can be way outside of your region to join which can make the games sometimes laggy. Online play, Offline Multiplayer, andd. Challenge mode! Got it all for $5, and although there is better games out there.. this is the only one that I am aware of that plays the way it does. It's unique, and definitely worth it to get it during a sale price.Goodluck and have fun if you decide to get it :)Update: Game is fun yes, but after playing more there is way too many laggers, too much game crashing, and the people on the forums are rather condescending to those stating facts. Heck. Even some long-time players agree that hte game crashes way too much. Not exactly promising it would get fixed. Also, gets a bit repetitive. It's fun.. but not fun enough for a thumbs up anymore. I'll still play it on occasion, but meh.Side note: Being taunted by laggers in games is kind of annoying too. It's like. ""Hey, you're bad but in reality i'm the lagger that can't get a good connection."" and no, i'm not referring to those that are not even close to your region, i'm talking those in the same area as you that somehow have a ridic ping.
