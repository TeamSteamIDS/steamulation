								Not wanting to sound overdramatic... But games like these while playing multiplayer. They show a glimpse of what's to come!Here's what i mean:I just played a multiplayer game with a random dude. I spawned in, looked up and saw him looking at me. He waved at me. I waved back. I didn't know what to do to start the match. So i made a shrug gesture towards him. He pointed to the table where it clearly stated what button i had to press. I pressed it and the game begun.We played for a long time. Both of us trying different serves and screws. During the match we did all kinds of gestures towards eachother. Gestures of sadness when you lost an important point while the other celebrates with his hands in the air. Gestures of frustration when you lost a lot of points in a row etc... Body language in VR is really easy to understand. At least to me...It was getting late and i had to go to sleep. I waved, he waved back and i disconnected. Never to see that player again...What's so cool about all this is that you can express yourself without any pre-programmed gestures like /wave, /dance, /whatever. Now you can make your own little dance when you win. You do your own gestures. You do you! It's magical!I can't wait for similar games like this one!I don't mention much about the actual game here except for the VR multiplayer experience.. But the game is actually really good. It feels pretty realistic. Sure it's not perfect... But it is pretty damn close i'd say.			"

								I should have done thins a while ago.BUY THIS GAME!!!!This is not only the best Ping Pong game on the Vive, but it has an AMAZING community and is very very polished.I have had hours and hours of fun playing people online which brings me to my next point.SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPERRarely have I seen a developer this involved, this commited and this passionate about their game. I had the pleassure of helping him test some items. Do you know why he was up late testing and developing? Because ONE PERSON was unhappy with something about his game, so he re-wrote a major part of the game to be better for us all.I got the chance to speak with him one on one and I can tell you without a doubt, he cares about this community and he wants nothing more than for us to just have fun.Game is a 10/10 for meDeveloper is a 10/10 for me as well.

								First multiplayer that works in ping pong. Its playable but lots to fix, you dont see properly what the opponent is doing, but the ball comes to you with no errors so you can hit it precisely. The IA has to improve, even the easiest levels of IA can make really fast and precise shots like a pro, that doesnt make sense. The voice chat is cool. there is no cancellation of the reverb though.I played from Spain with players in USA and was playable and fun.Cant wait to have the game with better net usage and with LEAGUES or CUPS in multiplayer. And rankings, that would be amazing.			"

								Hands down my favorite Vive game and best gaming expiernce Ive ever had!I just got the Vive yesterday and downloaded over 10 games guess which is the only game I've played and played for over 8 hours in 2 days? Yep paddle up has captivated me and I'm a terrible ping pong player, but I just put the Vive on and I can't help but load this amazing game up and then proceed to not put it down. I just had an awesome moment with a random guy I met in the UK we ended up going through the roof into the cosmic background map and went all the way to the universe above where we proceeded to hang out among the nebula, stars and planets and talked life and philosophy for a good 30 minutes, which preceded by some really funny role playing. The physics of the ball and the spin are just amazing and I can feel myself improving from game to game. I can't say enough about this game which I'm close to saying has been the most enjoyable gaming experience  I've ever had and I'm totally addicted. I can't wait to see what comes in the future, hopefully some sort of win loss record, rankings, leaderboard or tournaments. Would love to see maybe some unlocks of new hats or other skins for beating certain modes. Keep up the amazing work and I can't wait to see what u come out with next.			"

								Just played for about an hour, exhausted, sweaty and happy! This game is incredible. To those who's wondering if it's better than Waves - hell yes it is. Playing vs AI is challenging, practice modes are very well done and multiplayer... It's one of the best VR multiplayer experiences I've ever had. Ping is noticable but absolutely playable and enjoyable.I do hope the devs are going to improve the physics. I've yet to successfully land a right top spin. Something about top spin shots doesn't feel right, the ball just smashes into the net.			"

								I had the luck to be one of the testers of this game. I have been playing ping pong in a team for quite a while, and I really enjoyed to share a few suggestion with the dev, who is very very responsive.Even if it's early access you'll get an awesome experience, the more feedback he'll get, the better the game will become. That being said, imho this is already the best ping pong game out there!The AI is very strong and will give you a hard and fun time to be beated. Moreover there are already a few fun variations to the standard game. Keep up the good work mate!			"

								simply brilliant!! physics and responsiveness feel very close to the real game. Multiplayer works like a dream. I have had some of the most fun times ever on paddle up multiplayer, which leads me to my feature requests to the Dev: ** Can we have a record of the scores in all the games youve played ** can we have a simple 'friend' button so we can link with and find people again** and of course global and regional leaderboardsFinally, would love some more environments that are a bit more... gritty? unusual? eg top of the empire state building - in fact, why dont you allow users to upload their own 3d panoramas to use as play spaces? that would be really cool.In summary, this game is very, VERY good and simply a must-have for any Vive owner - just buy it!

								Updated (Aug 28, 2016):My initial review was ""Not Recommended"" based on looking for a game with reasonably accurate physics (particularly spin).  Within two days, the developer pushed through a pair of patches that demonstrate significant improvement.  While the game's physics still have further to go, just the inclusion of a reasonable simulation of spin physics is welcome.  Side spin in particular has gone from non-existent to functionally useful for serves and returns.  With each update, this game moves closer to the holy grail of true-to-life ping pong physics.Paddle Up is inviting with spartan but bright graphics.  The aesthetic is simple and straightforward.  AI opponents are represented by bright yellow robots, with human opponents sporting blue visors and controller/paddles.  Oh, and hats.  Lots of hats.The game includes several options for adjusting one's play area and paddle.  Orientation and position of the paddle can be altered to an ideal fit.  This is a welcome feature given the different grip choices for real paddles and the challenge of simulating that with the Vive's controller.  Using penholder grip, I was able to adjust it until it was oriented to how a real paddle would feel in my hand.AI is serviceable.  In truth, programming a realistic AI opponent will likely be a significant challenge.  As a consequence, the different AI modes feel inconsistent.  For example, playing Novice they routinely returned more difficult shots, only to subsequently flub an easy one.  The AI also hasn't kept up with the physics changes as I've found they have a weakness for side-spin serves.Multiplayer is great.  I've put a few hours in matches with various online opponents.  Connecting to an opponent proved simple and painless.  Ping is a challenge.  Playing a few matches with 150+ms ping, it was difficult to anticipate returns as the ball would often materialize enroute to my side of the table, thus reducing reaction time significantly.  I did manage to get in a few <60ms matches and those were highly playable.  One challenge in multiplayer is finding opponents of similar skill.  Hopefully as the game grows, skill-based match-ups become an added feature.Overall, this is a promising game.  The developer's quick response to feedback and pushing through patches gives me a lot of confidence that this title can develop into a premier VR table tennis game.			"

								I update my review after 7 hrs of playing, and I bet to spend many, many more on this game.Everything on this world is perfectable, especially if your standard is the real life and you consider unsatisfiying everything is under. My standard for a great game is than need to be fun, easy to get in but hard to grow, give hours of entertainment and offer an almost flawless gaming experience. More, when is a multiplayer game I expect to find opponents anytime without care too much about where they are or ping, and had fun with them.Paddle Up offer all those things togheter in a very polished package. Run flawless with a good and polished graphics with an humble 970, is satysfing and playable even with modest latency with people on the other side of the earth, you can find opponents in seconds in any hour. I leave to professional players all comparisions about real world phisics. I'm not a pro in billiard too (and played more this one than table tennis), I don't think than Pool Nation simulate 100% of the real life experience, but it's a damn good game and an outstanding muliplayer experience. Paddle Up is just as good.I've lots of other stuff to play on those days, but I can't stop playing Paddle Up.			"

								I've been beta testing this game. I own PongWaves as well which is decent, but this game kills it! I'm actually able to apply real world techniques, spin, and more while playing which is just awesome. It also looks incredible with SS on, almost life like rendering. The ball physics are spot on. It has custom paddles where a person can choose a smaller size for handicaps, thickness for ball control and hardness, online multiplayer, player customization, and two well modeled environments. The computer AI is solid and will give you a damn good run for your money. Everything is extremely well polished, even down to the way the score is displayed on the table. Trust me, if you like table tennis, you owe it to yourself to buy this game now, you won't be disappointed! This will definitely be the new king of Vive table tennis games.			"

								This is the only VR ping pong game I have played but I'm enjoying it quite a lot. The graphics are pleasant and the physics and sound effects feel right. I've played a few online matches, there was some slight lag but it was playable. My opponents seemed to be from other regions so I assume the latency would be much better under more ideal conditions.I would recommend trying the challenges and having patience when it comes to the difficulty curve of the AI. Some have complained that the AI is too hard but I think those people might just be too impatient. I am now having competitive matches with the ""Skilled"" AI (the third difficulty level out of 6) after only a few hours of play. I've found it to be very rewarding as I had trouble beating even the easiest AI when I first started.Overall I am extremely satisfied for my $10.			"

								Overall, this game is very good at satiating the need to play ping pong.  It's extremely accurate for the most part - there are some sublte differences you won't notice unless you are a very avid player.  Some of the moves I do in real life don't quite translate, but it's easy to try different moves.This is well worth the $10.00.  As a suggestion, the only thing I'd like to be added would be some sort of narrative structure... kind of similar to punchout! It'd be great to play against different AI characters that were a little more varied and maybe some personality.  That bit of flair might really elevate the game beyond just ping pong.			"

								For me one of the best games ever made! Stick with me here. Ironic that the first game I ever played was pong on the Atari. Never played table tennis in my life so I couldn't tell you about the ball spin, bat weight and if it does the real sport justice. But the thing is this is the first VR game that's made me feel I'm somewhere else.the first game ever! I can't tell you how many times I've almost put my bat on the table in front of me. Space pirate trainer, Raw Data, Holopoint and the rest are amazing but I put my Vive down to play the new Deus Ex. Paddle Up made me pick it back up again. I'm still utter rubbish and it'll be a long time till I beat the AI even on casual but you do feel like you're learning and getting better and that's what games are about right? I think this is probably more of a review of the Vive/VR as I was past the awestruck stage some time ago but Paddle Up does show (me at least) there definitely is a future for virtual reality and it can only get better.

								I have tried all of the Ping-Pong games currently available and I have to say after having tried this in SP and MP. Nothing else even comes remotely close to how amazing this already is.- Beautiful graphics and environment (especially when you apply 2.0+ Super-Sampling)- Multiplayer actually works! It's fantastic and even shows you ping - latency to your opponent.- AI is great and the robot/full body animations are a welcome change from just paddles.- Physics are by far the most realistic, especially with the different available paddles.* Needs work on NET code; combatting latency. Right now, if someone has 100+ ping; you will often not see the ball until it's coming barelling towards you, by then it's too late.			"

This game is better in every way. Not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on Pong Waves...I love Pong Waves..but this game just has like 10x the amount of stuff pong waves has and does it better. This is the first VR game that I feel doesn't need an update.			"

								Overall this game is amazing and I definitely recommend buying. It's certainly worth 10€ if not even more. Extremely polished and far better than any other ping pong game atm.Pro: - Lots of customization- Decent physics- Very good haptic feedback- Multiplayer has very little delay- Voice chat has good quality- Lots of Singleplayer modes, different practices, minigames and AI matches- This might as well be a con but the AI plays really good (Maybe too good at lower levels)- The UI and menu options are very well done and good lookingCon:- Very often some sound effects fail to be played (e.g. ball hitting paddle)- The sounds at lower volume are fine but the sounds at higher volume (e.g. hitting the ball very hard) need to be louder imo- This could be because of the cheap htc vive earphones but the 3D sound wasn't working correctly, everything in a cone of ~30° in front of me was at 10% volume. As soon as I rotated my head slightly the volume went up- Even though the delay is smaller than in other ping pong games, it's still jarring and should be the number 1 priority to eliminate "

								Let me start this by saying that table tennis has to be my favorite sport all time. I love the sport and I play for fun but I am by no means an expert, or even experienced table tennis player. When I first heard about VR table tennis, my thought process was went a little something like ""I own a VR Headset, I have some money to spare, I love table tennis, hell yeah I'm picking this game up!""I own Ping Pong Waves VR and just downloaded Paddle Up. I was very excited to try Paddle Up based on my experience with Ping Pong Waves VR.GAME MODESHand's down Paddle Up wins in this category, there's so many game modes to choose from. From AI to target practice. I would say the most valuable game mode is the mode that you practice against a trainer machine. You can customize the speed and setup that balls flies in to practice your forehard, backhand, smashes and anything else you can think of. I haven't played Ping Pong Waves VR in awhile but I don't remember as much game modes in that game.PHYSICSThere's two ways that I see physics in these games (simple and complex). Simple physics points to the direction and speed your ball bounces based on the angle and speed your paddle moves. Complex physics points to the changes in behavior of a spinning ball when it hits a surface. Right now, I feel that both games has relatively similar simple physics. The way the ball bounces off your paddle when you don't do any crazy maneuvers feels tight on both games.Complex physics is another story, in this scenario, I feel that both games can use some work with the ball and surface interaction. One thing that I felt that these game lacks is that, even though you can spin the ball with your paddle, the way a spinning ball interacts with the paddle is not reflected accurately. For example, a ball that has a top spin coming towards your paddle will naturally bounce up if the face of your paddle is vertical. If a ball has a down spin, the ball tends to bounce downwards on a vertical paddle. If you have a ball with a top spin, it usually travels faster (travels faster in air, descends faster in air and increases speed more once it hits the table a second time), if you have a ball with a down spin, it travels slower (travels slower in air, descends slower in air, decreases speed more once it hits the table a second time). All these ball to surface/environment (table and paddle) interactions seem to be missing which brings me to the tackiness of the paddle and ball lifting. It seems to be impossible to do the forehand and backhand shots that lifts the ball slightly using the tackiness of the paddle. I also did not see an option to customize your paddle's tackiness which led my to believe that the physics was not implemented in both games. I am by no means criticizing the game's physics, I think they are already super impressive and I understand there are technical limitations. I just wanted to point these out and hopefully these types of comments would help the developer (if they see this).MULTIPLAYERAgain, Paddle Up wins this category. Multiplayer mode was seamless. I clicked to find a match and immediately a player popped up and we played 5 rounds. Even if the player was a horse, it felt like the player was in the same room as me. We said ""Hi"" by waving our paddles. He instructed me with his paddle to press the start button on my menu controller to exit warm up and start the game (I didn't know that we had to at first). We clapped and congratulated each other when a person scores. We shrugged when we missed a shot. We pointed and passed the ball to each other when it was each other's turn. We waved ""Good-bye"" before we left. It's amazing how far technology has come! There was a slight bit of geographical latency between the other player and I, based on the player's movements (the ball moved just fine), but that was to be expected since I really didn't expect the developers to defy physics and break the speed of light. The game was still totally playable however.My multiplayer experience with Ping Pong Waves VR was not as solid however. I queued up for a game which seemed to me like 10 mins, when a player finally joined, we had trouble connecting and the game never started. I gave up and so I never really did have a multiplayer experience in that game to talk about.OVERALLI'm really excited to see where VR will take this genre! I honestly think that the games deserves to be priced more than $4.99 and $9.99. My hope is that they continue to polish their games and eventually we will not be able to tell the difference between real and virtual table tennis! The developers have my 100% support and I proud to have paid for their games. I think that by honing my self in this game, I would be able to surprise my coworkers soon by wrecking their faces in table tennis one day.			"

								I'll review with a story, if you hate those reviews, it's super super close to real world table tennis. Get it if you have room and like TT.Story portion:I try to play an online game and when I get matched and ready up all I hear is the other guy giggling into the mic and just messing around hitting the ball back and forth. I begin to get impatient and try to tell him to start but he didn't have any headphones or something of that sort. Soooo I'm messing around doing my different serves (I'm no waldner or ma Lin but I can play pretty well for an amateur). So after a while I notice him mimicking my super slow bounce it back into the net backspin serve. So I get his attention and begin to slowly show him the paddle angle and the swing direction. After around 15 minutes of practice, he hits a perfect one! We celebrate by trying to bounce the ball off the ceiling! But, I literally taught him the proper (decent) form of how to cut a slow backspin serve just over the net! All this with someone miles away (200 ping type distance). That's incredible to me!As for improvements, the spin is incredible but the things needed are the reactions by the rubber to different spins. Backspin into the net and such.  Also there is no catch from the rubber when trying to loop a forehand shot, it just hits according to the paddle angle and speed.  I'm sure it's coming in a patch.			"

								It feels like Unity physX cranked up. Ie, bad. The paddle parameters are neat but without decent drag and lift it feels stiff. Its pretty inaccurate when you swing the paddle fast, and converting spin on to the ball is inconsistent.Not much is done to compensate for the latency in multiplayer and it feels like its bouncing off a proxy server so you get a good 1/4 sec of lag. The sterile rooms are well lit.Cute for slowly pushing the ball to each other, not really a good sim for decent players.			"

								The vive cannot keep up with fast swings of the remote controls. It is in fact impressive that it can track very fast movements so well. However there are slight innacuracies when you make very quick movements, leading to some frustratingly inconsistent ball behavior. I play table tennis well in real life, but this doesn't play the same way. If you only make slow movements, it feels real, and is actually quite fun. Any fast swings, and it will fall apart.  "

Paddle Up is probably the best Table Tennis Simulator in Virtual Reality.Pros:+ Realistic and beautiful graphics+ Perfect physics and overall ball movement+ Very nice motion controller support - it just feels so real! + Nice vibration in controllers while touching the ball+ Spins can be applied and feels realistic (not too much of spin)+ Sound and background music is good for a table tennis game+ Realism - it really feels realistic compared to other table tennis VR games!Cons:- Mixed Reality support is not fully working yet in menus (controllers not working while in MR mode)Paddle Up has full room scale support, motion controller tracking and voice chat in Multiplayer. Paddle Up has both Single player (AI mode) against computer with many difficulty levels, as well as Multiplayer mode where you can play against people from all over the world. There are challenges, practise mode and lots of paddle customization in the menus.I'm really impressed about the level of realism, the perfect physics, nice control system and of course the graphic details as well. The surrounding environment feels very realistic and the gameplay is fully immersive. If you are looking for a table tennis simulator in VR, you don´t need to look further - get Paddle Up and you will love it!CheersSweViver			"

								I've played the other major Ping Pong games and each has its own strengths. The multiplay is really solid in Paddles UP, and this is the only PP game to get that right. My only issue is the AI difficulty. The are six settings. I am admittialy not a very good Ping Pong player, but I should'nt lose every game I play in causual mode. I can beat the lower difficulty around 50% of the time in Pong Waves and VR Ping Pong, but even the lowest difficulty kicks my ♥♥♥ in Paddle Up. There are six difficutly settings, maybe turn down the lowest for scrubs like me. Other than that, great game.			"

It plays nothing ike real table tennis (I am a club player but couldnt do a normal serve with this or play 60% of my normal strokes...just had to open the bat and push it back) but maybe it will improve over time (or maybe its a limitation of VR) but is well worth the money and probably the best simulator yet of 'ping pong'.

Early Access Review
								Solid ping pong game. I've got one of the competitors, but find myself playing this one more at the moment. Firstly the gameplay is fun. Even though there's just the one robot avatar for the AI, it moves convincingly and especially after this first patch seems to make regular people errors. I'm no pro but the ball action seems pretty good. Sound effects and graphics are nice, too. Most of all, as with any game, it's fun.What sets it apart right now from the other early access Pongs is that there's a more complete set of options for customization and practice, and the Multiplayer works well. I've only played with a handful of people and had a blast. There've been a couple of lag induced glitches but rarely have I felt cheated out of a point. The absolute best thing is that you can queue up for a multiplayer match and keep playing single player. That ROCKS. You don't just have to stand there looking at the ""wait"" sign. Pick up the paddle and go, and when your virtual buddy shows up, it switches over. Even better, the game doesn't start right away. You can still hit the ball back and forth for practice volleys and chit chat, but just like a real game it doesn't start until you're both ready. I had fun with another player just doing trick shots and kibitzing before we played. Replay options are also clearly laid out. Super-well thought out!Definitely worth the buy if you like pong.			"

								Not perfect but very well done as it at least comes close to resempling reallife tabletennis. A few things that would be great:Ability to spin the ball more and have the table and especially the opponent bat/racket respond more to it.Even at the highest difficulty the AI serves super easy serves - please make those a lot harder as no ""master"" would ever serve like that ;-)For people that are not good but want to practice it would be helpful if you could somehow have an opponent that shoots easy balls to you but at the same time is not so bad a player themselves as you just seem to waste time when the AI misses the ball so often - hope that made sense.Hard smashes are not handled too well and way too often either end up in the net of off the table. Being a decent player I can easily tell that something is ""off"" with the phsycis but I imagine this may be a hard one to crackMultiplayer was quite laggy (only tried once) but that might of course have been a bad connection with either of us - super fun by the way!With that said (and having tried for fun to develop exactly the same myself) I want to applaud you for taking the game this far - I am impressed.

								I gave Paddle Up a try last night and ended up playing a best of five match with a player from Poland. We were both just north of 200 ms ping and the game was still remarkably playable. The dev seems to have made a really smart move regarding latency. Somehow, despite the occasional lag, the client would make sure that the ball was moving smoothly and accurately before it reached the point of being struck. The game was very competitive and it felt convincing enough that we both started using real life tactics to get the advantage. Big kudos to thePavelish for making the best multiplayer experience in Vive so far!I've tried every table tennis game on Vive and this is definitely the one to beat now. I will be online looking for matches tonight. :) Hurray! "

I feel like I get a workout especially when killing the ball with major topspin. Very exhilarating when rallying and making incredible shots because you actually have to earn it.

Didn't expect too much and wouldn't have cared if it had been mediocre with the price being quite low at £6.99.It's now my best buy so far. The AI is really challenging, still trying to beat the robot on Casual level. But the physics and precise movements are so good. It's just like playing table tennis without the thud of the ball on the bat.Once I have beaten the AI a few times, I'll graduate to multiplayer at a reasonable skill level hopefully....I'm going to have lots of fun with this one!

								This is my first time writing a review for a game because I was actuallly pretty impressed by the accurate positioning and ball physics that this game offered. I was a table tennis captain of Ursinus College, and I would agree that this game is as close as you can be to playing ping pong in real life. The only flaws that this game has is the following:1.) half a second lag after each of the opponent's hit (this is basically just lag because we're online, we can deal with it)2.) Your custom made paddle in real life will not exactly match the exact texture and detail of your virtual paddle.3.) When you hit the ball, you won't feel the exact sensation of hitting the ball in real life, but it's very close because the vibrations of the controllers are trying to make you think you are.These flaws are just something that you have to work with and get used to, but this can definitely help amateurs become better players in real life no doubt, I can feel it especially when you practice constantly with the robopong.If every sports game was as great as this game in regards to accuracy, I would definitely buy all of them.Out of 30 VR games I have so far, I think that this is the 2nd best game I played so far. (AudioShield being the best)			"

								I used to play pingis for fun when i was younger and it's great to be able to do so again! It's so realistic that almost every mistake i make in the game is the same ones i used to do when i was younger. Multiplayer could use some latency fixes (performance depends a lot on your partner) and the physics can always get better. I sometimes also notice that the ball ""laggs"" instead of flying smoothly in the air, it shouldn't be an FPS issue. Other than that this is one of the most fun and polished VR games out there.

It would be great if there were a few more locations. One feature that would be really nice is to be able to turn the play space. You can move the table around, but as far as I can tell the direction you're facing is fixed.			"
