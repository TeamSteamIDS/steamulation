												If your looking for a quick game to kill time then this is the game for you. If you enjoyed the traditional hunting games then stay away.The worst part is that it feels like your a hunter on one of those staged hunts for rich people that the closest thing they got to a deer was when they setup their santa sleigh decorations. It feels like these animals were put there just to be shot. \it does not feel like a hunter game. Try the African Hunts instead of this thing.			",70,2,0,2,10,1,13

												Pretty boring port of a pretty boring game.Unlike the other Cabella games on steam which usually involve open world traveling, sneaking, tracking, etc, this game just consists of 96 ( why 96 and not 100? No Idea.) hunting galleries.You drop in random maps, shoot a few things, and hopefully score enough for a medal. Every 4 maps you pop back to the menu screen, to admire your stats and items I guess.It's sort of a crummy mix of arcade shooting and actual hunting. For some reason, you can get bonus powerups, such as x-ray vision and bullet time, as well as a free skill that basically highlights anything shootable in the area.You CAN move around but you move so slow and the maps are so small that there's not really much point. Which probably explains why you can't rebind your controls.Strangely enough, and this was never explained ANYWHERE, you can pull up the unlocks menu, and equip any items in the game at a moments notice, from scents to weapon sights to pistols to shotguns.The game is around 8 hours or less, but I usually got bored and walked away to do something else and just forgot to come back.If you want a quick arcadey shooting game to waste time on, then have fun with this. If you enjoy the style of the other Cabela games on Steam, you might want to just skip this.			",1990,759,87,209,233,21,260

												this game sucks so bad. was looking for a hunting game where i could actually run around and hunt. but this throws you in a tiny space with sucky guns, you can move anywhere at all, and the gra[hics are terrible.

The second Cabela's hunting game on Steam, and much different than the first.

No storyline, and no freedom to go wherever you want.
You're set up with what to hunt and can only hunt the certain animals needed to get awarded new weapons.

Pretty boring.

												To be honest not the best game I've played. I know better. I don't really think this is worth buying. It can be quite boring when you are stuck on one level, I honestly don't think this is a great game at all...So don't get wasting your money on  a boring game!			",26,4,2,2,1,1,2

												When i bought this game, i was expecting a bit more for my money, however i found myself completing the game in 6 hours!! i bought the other cabela games but i didn't like them as much as i did this one! If you prefer open world hunting games, i wouldn't reccomend this to you, i'd recommend the other Cabela hunting games! Pros:+ Nice simple hunting gameCons:- Short gameplay, took me 6 hours to clear the entire game- You can't go back and play old hunts, profile becomes ""complete""			",94,21,14,16,7,4,5
