												The Fishing Club 3D, free, simple and in my opinion one of the best, relaxing fishing games on Steam. I definitely recommend it if you are not looking for a serious, but just good time killing fishing game.			"

												this game is so great! so much more than just your average fishing game. there's a couple small bugs (for now) but none that deter me from playing. good bye to all other fishing games, i'm sticking with this one!			"

												+ Colorful game+ Excellent soundscape+ Good tutorial throughout+/- Slow paced game, but, hey, that's fishing!- Game pauses while trying to load assets...for a very long time.  The back end server needs more attention.Make up your own mind with this gameplay:

												Fun for a little while, but this is an extremely hollow experience. Everything is too simple, due to the mobile origins of the game. I'd recommend checking this out on your phone if you're a mobile gamer, but I just don't see the appeal beyond a couple hours as a PC title.			"

												Good? In some ways yes, in other ways no. It's a mobile game through & through. Very repetitive casting and reeling in fish with no nuance. YES I've gone fishing before and I realize that's fishing but in other games there is some technique added. Personally I can't get into because it's looks so bad :(They fixed the resolution, it is a lot more playable for me. It seems like a pretty fair business model and there are a lot of quests. Who am I to tell you how to spend your time?Ah here's a video,

												So far, pretty relaxing and laid back.  To be fair, I just started it, but loving what I'm seeing already.  For die-hard fishers like myself, I'm worried it might be too simplistic, but time will tell if it gets more deep and realistic, will update as needed.Only real issue I'm seeing so far is been having an issue sharing highlights to Facebook... seems to clock and get stuck, and upon checking Facebook the share doesn't appear to be there.  Went to share making level 2, and the game froze, so until that's ironed out, I may steer clear of social-sharing for the time being.Great replacement for Fishing Planet, which was a great game, until they purposely nerfed it to force nickel and diming of players in the cash-shop just to even have a semi-casual experience.EDIT: Found another small issue; seems to be a bit of loading lag for items outside the game (may explain the FB issues), like when trying to load the shop, often times I'm staring at blank windows while nothing loads; might be because I'm currently at a hospital and on a public network... will test further later.
