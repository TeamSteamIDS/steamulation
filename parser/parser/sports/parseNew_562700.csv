												This game is absolutely atrocious, and if you're looking for a paintball game like Greg Hastings this is not it. Also all these positive reviews are payed for and completely false. Save your $5 and your steam refund.			"

												Honestly, this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. BUT, because its so cheap i have to say if you and your friends are looking for fun then get it! We played for about 20 minutes and we couldnt stop laughing it was great. It stopped being funny after about 20 minutes but hey, its $5 what can you expect			"

												If you have a couple of friends, $5, and need something to waste time? this is probably the best $5 shooter ive seen in a while, and they are still updating it so its getting even better, hope to see more from this game and I truley reccomended #ripcod			"
