Early Access Review
								Is this a joke? I read dev's post ""Please read before buy"" and i said ok i get it, the game is under development and it is nowhere near complete. But this isn't even playable right now, It is just a white background with some pictures and very very few buttons and full of bugs. I started a new game in 1 January and it said next game 11 January, i pressed the continue button until February and nothing happen, it still says next game 11 January. And apart from that there is nothing you can do right now. This shouldn't be in Steam early access, it is clearly way early for this and the devs say buy this game only if you want to support us, which is against Steam rules.Proof that i dont lie: http://i.imgur.com/6lx5dab.png and i didnt even try to find this bug, it happen at my first time i played it. Imagine how many game breaking bugs there are. Another time i played the game i saved it and next time i pressed load and a loading screen appear, i let it load for 5 minutes and nothing happen.

								This is about as bare-bones as bare-bones gets.  I'm not going to condemn it as a bad purchase yet since it was $7, but this is the reason I can't stand Early Access.  The game, in total, has about 10 screens.  The information you have is minimal. The only real options you have to do are to pick up free agents, edit tactics, which are three sliders, and press continue.  Any sort of stats are minimal to nonexistent.  I played for 10 minutes and literally I found and exhausted everything there was in the game.On a lighter note, I don't want to completely write off this game.  I think it has a lot of potential, it's just cursed with the evil ""early access"" label.  The best description for the game is: wildy incomplete.  Give it a few months before there's any sort of substance to the game.  I want to like it and I will certainly try again, but as of the time I'm writing this, there's virtually no game to speak of.

								Brought this game on a 90% off sale to see if The Tambourine have taken more care of this game than Dream Factory which was their first, expensive, update once and leave game.Cyber Team Manager appears to give more to do than Dream Factory, most of the text isn't in gibberish so you got some sense of what to do although broken english and spelling mistakes (Atack instead of Attack is one example) is a common theme in both games.Updates have been slow to arrive or are non existant with a promised February update failing to materialize.This game is great for giving your mouse clicking finger a workout but other than that there isn't much to write home about, you make a profile, pick a country and team and then it is game on and the quirks and frustrations begin.Overall, Cyber Team Manager is ahead of Dream Factory in terms of completion and I suspect The Legions of Rome is ahead of Cyber Team Manager though it like Dream Factory appears to be abandoned.Recommended for those who like their patience tested or want a game for their 'I Survived Playing.....' collection.

								Lol, I've played the Football Manager series and they have a great format. The developers take pretty much a lot of their ideas from that and put it here ... except they haven't catered it properly here. They even use 80% of the same skills like 'Flair, Vision, Bravery'... LOL Basically this is like me watching Masterchef or some cooking TV show and me trying to replicate all the methods ... to build a sandcastle. "

Early Access Review
								Update 6/7/2016Bought it again after awhile to check out any updates.Bugs haven't been fixed yet, at all. Dev has just added a bit more content to it. Added a weird part where you tell your players what to do in a fight? Thats not up to the managers but ok. You can pick/ban heroes. Not interested in that. UI is still messy and as i mentioned, there are bugs. Wait for final release and reviews before buying.No. No.One thousand times. No.At the moment, don't bother. Game needs serious work. Also needs a good translator as the grammar is pretty bad. There's no way to tell if the training sliders work.At the beginning, you would think that you pick a league, and then you can pick a team in that league to manage, that is incorrect. You just pick the team, which has the league in a column to the left of it.Text during a match goes way too fast, and not to mention the fact that there is a slider at the bottom of the match screen that does god knows what?Did I mention the very poor english?You just mindlessly click around trying to figure out what to do since there's no tutorial.Can't tell if training is based on an individual or the team as a whole, since you can select each person on the team but the sliders for training don't change at all.It also seriously needs more countries. The list there is a joke. Wish tab worked as well when inputing text into fields.Refunding and waiting for this game to get out of early access.			"

								What the hell? Dont release a game that is not even close to being done. Like honestly, this is the most uncompleted game on steam right now. No instructions, no idea on how to play. Lucky is has cards otherwise it would have been refunded within the 5 min I played.Use this as a lesson for all devs and yourself to not put out a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 5% done game and expect to get good reviews on it.Dont buy untill this game is DONE and FINISHED			"

								Buy this game at 75% think it cheap, now it discount 90%Current stage of game is unplayable, I am a programmer and I can pretty sure the developer for this game, programming is just one of their hobby, they can't even plan simple flow like to disable ""Continue button"" when match is going on, it is about project planning but not optimization, so i don't expect a reason like it just early access, it is as simple few line of codes will do the job . Not to said more than 70% of the button is unlinked and not functional.I am giving chance of this game as I really like the concept, i belief developers are same too, but i hope you guys can rethink to join in new developers that can help you do better planning and programming so the project could success but not become a dead EA project, as I see the following development flow are related with FPS mode that are not really that important first when your basic core game engine is still full of bugs. Good luck developers.			"

								Chill Guys this is one of the first dev stage of the CTM!!As the DEV-s described DO NOT buy the game (unless you a crazy DOT..MOBA fan as me OR you want to follow the development of this great game) because atm its not worth it. The concept is great, but I'm very courious: Will the devs handle to make a good and long dot... moba gameplay in the future? This will definetly be the key.Good Luck DEV-s keep it up !I will often update my review during the new deploys:PROS:          - Good ConceptCONS:          - The game is on too early stage even to release as early acces.             (However the devs start with this the Desc. of the game)          - AT THE MOMENT its definetly not worth it (Thats why its a NO for me)			"

								This game really get me interested. From the concept it's like playing a football manager which is one of my favourite game. But honestly this game not even ready to be an early access. Some buttons not functioning, can't save/load previous games, and many things that still not properly done. But, i hope this year the developer give more their hard work and i'm sure this game will be very entertaining			"

								Well i know it is early access and event on an holiday offer, but it really ain't worth putting you're money into this project jet, i might recommend it later on but for the moment it is a BIG NO...The game is buggy, no settings are offered, alot of buttons doing nothingLooks like a school project, so might get updates for each grade the developer is getting on the education :)and he/they might be inspired by the online CS Manager game			"

								ENG:According to the current development of the game at the level of the game is not even worth the early access game. This game could be my first and smallest of the early access game that does not even work.Luckily I had purchased the game -90% discount.I think the best features of this game are just:- The game idea- The game file to a small size- Quick installation- After all, the game is able even to start and shut down- Quickly and easily removedThe worst features of the game are:- Almost everyting else- The game could have developed in some other simpler than the game engine Unity, and therefore I may be a bad  choice to choose the Unity of such a simple game, the game engine.- The game play is almost completely disordered, since most of the content does not even work.- The interface is confusing and difficult to use.- No game sounds or music- Load / Save a game function not working- There is not are any usefull guide or tutorial in this a game- Player can't create or edit AI or set avatars.- Almost invisible to use Interface, which is between difficult to detect buttons.- Possibly a slow game development- Small updates to the game, who do not make significant changes or updates to this game...... And all this is what I said and what is currently only a game, so is it worth 8 euros in early access?I do not believe that, this game play development should not go on for very long, because the game was so simple.In this mode, the game can not be recommended in any case to anyone. Hopefully, the game gets big repairs soon.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIN:Tämän hetken pelin kehitys tasolla kyseinen peli ei ole edes early access arvoinen peli. Kyseinen peli saattaa olla minun ensimmäinen ja pienikokoisin early access peli, joka ei edes toimi. Onneksi sain ostettua pelin -90% alennuksesta. Mielestäni parhaat ominaisuudet tässä pelissä ovat vain:- Pelin idea- Pelin tiedosto pieni koko- Nopea asennus- Pelin pystyy sentään edes käynnistämään ja sulkemaan- Nopeasti sekä helpposti poistettavissaPelin huonoimmat ominaisuudet ovat:- Melkein kaikki muu- Pelin olisi voinut kehittää muullakin yksinkertaisemmalla pelimoottorilla kuin Unity ja siksi pidän mahdollisesti huonona valintana valita Unity tälläisen yksinkertaisen pelin peli moottoriksi.- Peli on lähes kokonaan peli kunnoton, koska suurin osa sisällöstä ei edes toimi.- Käyttöliittymä on sekava ja hankala käyttää.- Ei peli ääniä tai musiikkia- Pelin tallentaminen ja lataaminen eivät toimi- Ei sisällä mitään kunnollista opasta tai tutoriaalia- Pelaaja ei pysty muokaamaan vastustajia tai muuttamaan heidän avatareita- Lähes näkymätön käyttö liitymä, josta on välillä vaikea havaita painikkeita.- Mahdollisesti hidas pelin kehitys- Pienet pelin päivitykset, jotka eivät tee merkittäviä muutoksia tai päivityksiä tähän peliin......Ja kaikki tämä mitä mainitsin ja mikä toimii tällä hetkellä vain pelissä niin, onko se 8 euron arvoinen early accessista?En uskoisi että, tämän pelin peli kehitykseen ei pitäisi mennä kovinkaan kauan, koska peli niin yksinkertainen. Tällä tilassa peliä ei voi suositella missään tapauksessa kenellekään. Toivottavasti peli saa pian isoja korjauksia.			"

								I have been looking at this game for a long while now like in january when it first came out so you should listen to me about this and i also play LoL and Dota. Pros:-Great Concept-Made On a good engine that many companies use-has a UI that is not bad or goodCons(this part might be a bit long):-They leave empty spaces in this game's GUI (it's like if i gave you a popcorn bag without popcorn)-  The art is not complete - You cant make a custom team you have to use premade teams with crappy names that you can't change- You just press a button and wait for something to happen- Many Bugs- The name of the game file ""game.exe"" really? really? - the company that made this.Company Cons: -The Tambourine is a horrible company -Look At Dream factory- Dream factory (another game that they made) is a rip off of prison architect- They don't work on old games-This game was just a money grab it will never ever be finished - stupid company if you wanna make a stupidly unfinished game please supply 3 hours of gameplay so us the players can't refund your crap game- this game is not ready to even be on greenlight so idk why it is on steam.

								As I'm a huge fan of the ""Managerial"" types of games I can see this game has a huge potential.As the game is in it's very early stage don't expect a whole lot of gameplay. Rather, support the devolper and offer him up ideas on the game and how he can progress it.Together, we can all watch the game progress and develop into something amazing.			"
