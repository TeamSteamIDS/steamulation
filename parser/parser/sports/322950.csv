												Good:+++ Full controller support++ Good looking++ Nice, chilled musicNeutral:~ Offers in-game purchases for card styles, chips and more~ 10 achievements in under 1hBad:- - - High retail price for what is offered- -  AI is not great- - Very little features beside the core game- No way to interact with the players, not even a chat- Purchasing process for In-game purchases is broken- No ""look at played hands"" featureIn conclusion:If you want to play poker with a mouse and don't need the 3D graphics, there are better options for free with more features. I guess the game is all right, if want to sit on the couch with a controller and play just some  hands of poker alone... Wait till a sale comes around. 8-12€ would be okay price for it.			"

												Texas oops I ment to say Pure Hold'em is a poker game, yea figure it out...There was me last night entering a game for first time, lights were off, AC was on, light smell of ciggaret I smoked few minutes before, with game atmosphere gave me feeling like I was in reall casino... no bs.Let's go with pros and cons now:PROS:+ Graphic is awesome+ Music chilled casino style+ Gameplay:Tournaments, sit 'n go, leaderboards, smart AI, playing offline mode you earn money to play online, high/low with reset on 24h, achievements, lots of tables splited by buy-in. Beatiful card designs, with option to buy even more(for ones with deep pockets)CONS:- Camera, when cards are dealing I cant wait to get my cards to look at them, because my player from his own reasons is just wandering around the tabe, and it makes me dizzy after short period of time.- Impossible interaction with other players, because there is no chat whatsoever, devs please implement it in next update Overall:It is beautiful poker game, best there is for PC platform, just need little finishing touch, like puting a chat in it ^^If you are in poker like me, hell I have over 5000 hours on FB Texas Hold'em, you will love this game.Il give it a score for now 7/10 because I really find that chat in poker game is of crutial importance.

												Wow what a terrible game.  Can only play against the AI, not against humans.  That wouldn't be so bad, except the AI is awful at poker.  I mean really awful.  For example, the AI telegraphs the strength of their hand by their bet sizing.  Also, donk leads into you after you were the preflop aggressor mean either top or middle pair every time, so you can either bluff raise on overcards or fold if you have no equity.  Overall, it's just a bs cash grab imo.  I've played a ton of poker in my day and this is hands down the computer worst poker experience i've had.			"

												This so doesn't worth the price tag. It actually should be F2P. Really. Bought it during Christmas sales, and even then was surprised how terrible it is. I had more fun with Poker Night at the Inventory and Poker Night 2, not to mention the F2P The Four Kings Casino and Slots.There is no need to tell you about the negatives about chat or lobby or that you have to buy chips with real money. And I don't mean chips like skins or anything like that, which is also the case, I mean CHIPS TO PLAY WITH. What the f?Did I also mention that the freaking camera is also nauseating? Also why can't I keep my cards always visible to me? That's just stupid.Shame. Real shame.			"

												From the makers of my favorite Steam Pool game (Pure Pool), comes Pure Hold 'em. If you love poker, I think you'll like this game.Graphics/Eye Candy-Best I've seen in a poker gameMusic-Top Notch with many styles or can be set to shuffle all of themA.I.-Good I guess, Debatable really, from what I've played all of teh A.I. players have their styles, some are Fish, some only play teh nuts, and inbetween there also.Best Poker Game I've played on Steam-Yes, Hands downThe whole atmosphere really sets teh tone, as it did with Pure Pool, not enough can be said how VooFoo studios can suck you into a game.I do recommend this game, I haven't had to deal with any microtransaction some are down rating for, I'm sure if I go bust that time will come, but I don't have too much of a problem with it, you can earn chips by levelling up, so that is good, plus yuour table winnings if you come out ahead.I say give it a try, if ypu don't care for it, get a refund, but I hope for many players that way we can have some good multiplayer games.

												This is a great poker game, the graphics are great and I love the table and card options. I have the game both on the PS4 and on Steam (albeit I have played the PS4 version more) There are different tournaments with different buy in fees from a bar to a penthouse you can bluff your way to being a rich trillionare. There is a daily game of high and low which you can play to win chips, bank anytime or try to get the max amount if you are good enough, you also get chips by levelling up or you can buy chips via DLC.Defo the best poker game I have played, and because it is all virtual chips, I still have a house and a wife. :D Win win.

												DISCLAIMER: I was provided with a copy of this game to promote on my Twitch stream and I'll do my best to provide an unbiased review.I've always been a fan of Poker games offering me the chance to play without the need of actually having to throw down any money other than the gamble of a purchase price.The game itself is quite good from decent visuals to the amazing soundtrack I've come to expect and love from the ""Pure"" series.Graphics are pretty good and you can see the felt on the table and the clarity of the images in the cards however sometimes the frame rate is a little poor, (I'm currently using a 600-series nVidia at 2gb).As mentioned the sound is mesmerising with the sound of poker chips clinking, background noise, and the music filling the air.Card backings are of good quality too and the developers are constantly updating their games.The AI however feels a little basic and there's room for improvement, with the gameplay being as expected: its poker.It's certainly worth a look-see but maybe wait until a sale: as is I'd prefer other PC and console Poker games I've played and also some mobile games to.With regards to the Pure series the Chess game is phenomenal and I have it on multiple platforms and I feel my criticism is somewhat based on my expectations of the poker game being as amazing as the Chess.

												To read the full review of this game, please visit Mouse N Joypad; http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/pure-holdem-review/reviewing a poker game is actually kinda hard. If you’re reading this review, most likely, you’re already a huge Texas Hold’Em fan, and you know that these games aren’t really different in the big details, but rather in the small ones. I can imagine your primary concern being lag dropping you out of pocket aces. I can happily say, from what I played, I didn’t see many problems with the core online gameplay. The game runs smoothly, and I never experienced any dropouts.The biggest fault Pure Hold’Em has, as any poker game does, is it doesn’t feel any different. It’s sadly the same game you’ve been playing for years. That’s at no fault to VooFoo Studios, that’s simply because you have a very simple game, that has set rules, and can’t be changed up or ‘innovated’. So, my review really has to come down to the smallest of details.Something I really disliked was the fact that your opponents are electronic tablets sitting on a table. There’s no human models, no shadowy figures throwing chips- it’s a mini Facebook profile, with generic stock images as your opponents. Even worst, there’s no way to change your image, so any online opponents you meet display a generic cutout image. I should be able to make a profile, and use an image to represent my icy play style. Sadly, this is absent, leaving no shred of character in your seat.There’s also no in-room chat. I know some don’t want that, and would rather play the numbers game, but I do enjoy talking with random people while playing poker. The game is void of interactivity with your fellow players. I’m dying for the day when I can stare someone down through webcam, and you can pick up on someone’s tells. Aren’t we all sitting at the same table; shouldn’t we be able to at least talk to one another?The music is quiet enough that it does feel like a secluded casino, and the warm glow of unused slot machines surround the table. It does provide a nice ambiance, and Pure Hold’Em has set up a great mood with dim overhead lights, calming music and light sound effects. When the game wants to build tension, the camera pans into a slow motion reveal of the river, as the card slowly flips over. The overall experience is greatly increased through the game’s execution of tone.The graphics are nice, and the camera floats around the table smoothly, keeping the flow going continuously as the hands are played out. The chips are stacked quickly, and there’s nothing that really slows down the action. For a such a beautiful game, it plays like one of those fast paced online options, but with a stunning presentation.Finally, the in-game purchases, or as I’d like to call it, “pay to sit at the big boys table.” Want to actually play with people who won’t try bluffing every hand, than pull out your wallet again and pay for the privilege. I can understand playing with money on the line can add some excitement, but we’re not playing online poker- this is a video game. The reward should be getting to the Masters table, and picking up little perks along the way (maybe some customization of the absent avatars). Alas, it’s not a big deal- maybe people just like buying people at their table a pair of sunglasses or a fish with real money. Seriously, are we still doing the whole, “gift” system in these games? Can’t we have something more useful- like voice chat!?Being a poker fan, I feel confident in recommending this newest entry. It’s fast-paced, visually dynamic, and offers a great atmosphere in a reserved casino. The game however does feature some bizarre choices, such as playing against small electronic screens instead of people. The options are also lacking, at least until they allow you to buy different sets of cards. The game also has a pay-to-play element, that makes this feel less simulation, and more like a real casino. The game also has no voice-chat, or even chat, making the table feel void of personality. If you’re in need of some hands though, this will fit the bill- even if you feel lonely playing it.Thank you for reading my review, and if you'd like to read more, please visit Mouse N Joypad; www.MouseNJoypad.com "
