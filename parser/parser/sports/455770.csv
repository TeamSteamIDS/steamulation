								I played this game because it seemed like at least 50% of the developers had a beard.Was not disappointed.Pros:- Hilariously well done animations- Already quite a few different mini-game modes.- Smooth controls- Love the musicCons:- No online play yet. Will come later on though so hold your panties.- I think I yelled too much at my girlfriend10/10 would recommend my bearded friends again!

								I usually play games on my Playstation, but after learning that a local developer was releasing on Steam I thought I'd give it a try. Fortunately for me I could plug the PS4 controllers to play instead of using the keyboard. Last I checked, I had clocked around 7 hours in YamaYama and I can say that I've had incredible amounts of fun and laughed until my abs were sore. The game is basically a collection of minigames that you play through in a random order - or creating your own playlist. I've found that I like some game modes better than others, so I usually play through my own playlists. Anyway, to wrap things up here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Hilarious gameplay moments.- Art is ridicilous and only fuels the hilarity.- Easy to pick-up and play a few rounds.- Also fun to play for hours.Cons:- Even though the game is probably most fun with your friends next to you, it could use an online option.- It's hard to stay quiet when playing!If you're looking for a fun party game to play with your mates, this is probably one of the best values you can get. But as it has no online multiplayer or single player, it's strictly a couch game.			"

								The game is good fun for the first time or two but quickly devolves into a ""fat-suit"" fest.While that might sound fun, and it is amusing at first, it ends up falling flat as a result. It has 24 (at the moment game modes) which add a bit of diversity into what is going on. But in nearly every game mode (mostly with the exception of catching the falling pig) the objective can be completed just by running up and using the ""fat-suit"" button (which bumps away opposing players). After awhile it just becomes boring running around and fat-suiting all of the time (the random power-ups add slight diffusion).The graphics look great, and the game is certainly fun for a time or two, but it hasn't been brought back into our weekly games night. Seeing that it is in early access, I hope to see that it swaps out the fatsuit for other abilities and maybe greater diversity in game objectives (8-Bit Fiesta is a great example). But until that time, I can't really recommend it for any long-term, couch-coop enjoyment.			"

								YamaYama is a 2-4 player coop that is ideal for any kind of situation. A party, for family or just having fun with your friends. There is no online yet but it will come in the future.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes having fun.Its only 6.99$ which is an excellent prise, for an excellent game.			"

								I don't even know what inspired me to buy and play this game. But I am glad I did.It really ranks up there as one of the best local multiplayer games on Steam for me. I love the art and animations and the minigames feel unique and interesting. Whenever anyone asks for local multiplayer game recommendations, this is always on my list with more well known games like Towerfall, Duck Game and Lethal League. It currently is a mostly undiscovered gem, and I hope more people will discover it.			"
