												Wow! What a horrible game! I've played pool since I was 5.. That's 50 years of pool under my belt.I've never run across such BAD PHYSICS in a game in my life! Not even with DOS based games from the nineties has a game ever had such bad physics simulation.Aside from the fact that there's literally NO ONE online to play with. Waiting for 15 minutes for a match is unheard of.Don't waste your time on this one.Steam... you guys should really try the games you decide to go Green on. This one is an ABSOLUTE FAIL.			"

												I got this FREE game the day it came out, as i'm a big fan of pool games. Alas, it leaves much to be desired, based on the version up to and including the patch on 16th March. See below:PROS:- It's fun enough to play while watching the telly, for a time, and if you've nothing else to do.- It's free.CONS:- Extremely derivative: It's a pool game clone, and a poor one at that. It is outdone, not only by the majority of browser-based pool games, but also by the likes of Arcade Pool for the Amiga, which is now over 20 years old.- Putting spin on the ball has barely any effect whasoever. This needs to be ramped up significantly. I enjoy playing pool, though i consider myself an amateur, and even i can put triple the amount of spin on the cue ball as this game allows. As such, many shots which would be easy enough in real life (and most other pool games) are impossible here.- Only one mode of play: 8-Ball- Poor matchmaking, which can mean waiting forever for a game, even when there was an odd number of people in the sparsely-populated rooms. I've left it running for about 8 minutes without getting a game. However, exiting out of the room and rejoining seemingly got me a game much quicker than just waiting in the queue, indicating a glitch.- The ""hit boxes"" for the balls are clearly some way off. It is possible to hit an opponents ball when, very clearly, you should have hit your own ball first.- Although the latest patch states that you should ""win"" the game if your opponent disconnects, this isn't the case. I've lost my stake through no fault of my own because i've had to leave a game that my opponent disconnected from.- Sometimes, you can not pot any balls, and miraculously, it is your go again. Obviously, this is particularly annoying when it happens for your opponent.- The physics still need some work, even after 2 or 3 hotfixes.- The actual proper rules of 8-ball pool are not taken into consideration, e.g. at break-off, snookering behind a played balll without hitting a cushion/rail first.- Syncing issues which can cause you to lose time through no fault of your own.- Graphical glitching at the menu and room screens.I don't like writing reviews like this, but the fact of the matter is that this game is outdone by just about every other pool game available, and is at best a bare-bones pre-alpha. It could end up working, but at the minute, it isn't worth recommending, even for nothing. There are plenty of other, much more worthy, free, online multiplayer pool games out there that you could be playing.			"

												This review is from a fan of pool games and a player from several different pool games.Its just a failed copy of 8 Ball Pool.Literally everything is copied from 8 ball pool ,except one importante thing: physics. It has the worst reality in every pool games i played. The balls go with a incredible speed and suddenly they stop in the middle of the table, the movements aren't real at al...even if you shoot with medium force it stops in the middle of the target making you have to shoot with max force when it shouldn't be supposed to.Also the fact that the minimum value you have to play is 50 coins and you start with 250 coins makes you with short selection of choices when you start to play and , in a low quantity of games you can lose everything , even with the lowest entry possible.Other thing is bugs when you are searching for a game and it suddenly goes down , one time it even consumed my 50 coins because a match was found and i was redirected to the main menu.The last thing is also negative but not really a reason to criticize since the game is new , but the time you need to find a game is boring as sh*tPros:AchievementsFreeMultiplayer/Local games/Challenge friendsMany thing to costumizeCons:Bugs/GlitchIrrealistic physicsCopy of the well known 8-ball PoolHard to find a gameLack of coins / Needs more options with lower values.In my opinion you should try it just to see how it is , but i don't recommend it to play ""everyday"" as i recommend most of the games I played. Compared to other pool games , this one gets slightly behind.4/10[EDIT:Was playing a game with my last 50 coins , the game crashed and now i can't play for free?]- This problem is now solved in the new patch , but still need to wait 1 hour to get coins.[EDIT2: In the new patch they say the physics are better ( hopefully they are trying to improve due to the reviews) will try it later to see if it is any better now]			"

												The reason why i wouldn't recomment this game is that the game has some major bugs and ''glitches''. Me and my friend found a bug that makes your opponent's time run out even if he shot the ball. the speed is terrible. even with max speed the ball doesn't move that quickly as it should to actually hit bank shots. the game is copy of 8ball pool but the creators said that they are going to add new gamemodes such as 9ball. I know those glitches might not be glitches in your opinnion but we tested the time runout glitch with 2 over  200mbps download and 50mbps upload nets with 5-7 ping. The ''bags'' you are hitting balls are WAYYYYY too big, seems like the game has box colliders. I would rate this game 3 out of 10. 3/10.			"

												I don't understand the bad reviews towards this game. It just launched on Steam+it is free to play so of course there will be some bugs or unbalanced things, anyone with at least few active brain cells will understand that and won't hurl bad reviews instantly. So far, there are updates going on every day, fixing and balancing a lot of stuff, I personally wrote an email to the devs regarding getting stuck when opponent disconnects, and it got fixed the very next day I believe. Coincidence? Maybe, but it has been fixed and that's what matter to me. Just hold on with the reviews and give them few weeks, you'll see this game is above ""Mostly Negative"" status. (Regarding people saying they can't find any match, yes, obviously, it takes some time for this game to find its fans + it also depends on what time you're trying to find the match at, I find a match in about 2-3 minutes max.)

It also has more than just playing billiard, you can buy all shorts of things to your account. Like different sticks and so on. You can buy those via the the currency you get by playing this. Also you can buy them with real money. Big plus for that.I would recommend. Grade for this game 8/10			"

												It's a very simple pool game without anything special to it - and that can be a positive thing, too. A quick game of pool is just one click away, no need to think about settings things up - just click and play. On the other hand it feels like there's a lot of missed potential: game modes, custom game settings (no aim assist for either player etc.), score lists and matches (e.g. play five games against a friend in challenge mode and keep score). Maybe the game should have been named Simple Pool instead of Premium Pool because that name would have been more descriptive for this exact game.Pros:+ It's free to play+ Simple and quick to play+ Simple match-making+ Challenge modeCons:- No game modes- No game setup possibility- Shop prices feel quite high - there should be more mid-prized content- Not enough basic avatars (everyone I play against has the same face - quite tiring)- Just not enough content and features overall			"

												Was a great game, until the problems started. People win because the opponent connection falls away. People are cheating in this game and the developer is not doing enough to stop it.This game has issues with : connection to the server, game freezes, game crashes, white ball jumping from one place to the other place, people are cheating, if your connection is not good, you will loose the match even if you potted the 8-ball after successfully potting the other 7 balls in a row, ...My honest advice if you are looking for a good Pool game on Steam is Pool Nation FX. Pool nation FX is 3D, you can do tricks, has snooker gameplay, has 8-ball gameplay, has 9-ball gameplay and many other features that Premium Pool has not. Pool Nation FX runs smoothier, faster and stablier than Premium Pool.			"

												This game is simply a clone of the much more popular 8 Ball Pool from Miniclip. Now that doesn't have to be a bad thing, because the Miniclip game is actually pretty good. Unfortunately Premium Pool isn't even close to as good a game as the Miniclip one. Premium pool offers bad graphichs, unnatural ball movement and way too few players. The fact that so few people are playing it becomes an issue in an online based game. With maybe 4-8 players in each of the low-price places there is quite the chance that you won't get an opponent any time soon. And even when it displays an odd number of players in a room, matchmaking still takes ages. This is just not good enough. If you're looking for a good pool game, there are plenty of options out there that are better than this one.			"

												So today (23rd of march), the devs have released a patch that fixes matchmaking so I was actually able to get a couple games in. However, I still can't recommend this game as it stands.There might as well not be a power bar or a spin option because you hit it or you don't.Friction doesn't seem to exist and when the ball slows down, it still takes 5 years to stop.Balls clip through the pockets; this is entirely cosmetic but it still irritates me.What are physics?Although the matchmaking may be fixed, it took me back to the main menu 4 times after giving me the 'connecting' message before finally putting me into a game. At this point in time, it's not fun to play and I'd rather either play one of the many polished pool games or not play a pool game at all.			"

												I've played much better pay to win pool games, even on my phone.  This one is nothing special, if not a step backwards.  The main frustrating issue with this game is connection problems with the game server.  I live in the centre of a city with fibre optic broadband.  Which is fantastic.  Unfortunately, the one exception is playing ""premium"" pool.  To compound matters, the game assumes that you have lost if your connection is lost.  Therefore you can lose all of the money you've saved from winning without it being your fault.  The end user experience is that halfway through playing a game, the screen freezes. 30 seconds later it displays a big ""YOU LOSE"" then you see your money being transferred to your opponent.With a bit more work, it could be a second-rate pool game, but nothing more.  Don't waste your time.			"

												When I first saw the game, I automatically knew it would be a game that I would like! This game is a good pool simulator that will quickly grab your attention. Although, there are some cons about this game  that you really should know before getting this game.Most games have a way for you to practice the gameplay that you will come across while playing. When you think of this, you imagine a trainer that is going to go easy on you and you slowly start to get better as you continue! But no! Not this game! The practice mode isn't any easier than playing the regular game itself! In fact, it is probably harder than playing against a high-leveled player! The practice mode is pretty much just a computer with AimBot, and this bot perfectly makes every single shot without even taking more than 5 seconds to think! When I was doing the practice, I honestly began to wonder why these people even added a practice mode! I also wondered why this bot isn't at the top of the leaderboard... Not only that, but the practice mode always makes you hit the ball first, pretty much giving the bot a 95% chance to win without you even being able to do anything in the game! At that point, I wanted to repetitively bang my head against my desk!Shouldn't most games be able to connect you to a game or game lobby within a matter of seconds. Most games I know do that, but nooooooooo. Premium Pool not only has a huge problem connecting with other players to start a match, but it also has a problem staying connected. In order to get into a match, you have to pay coins, and if you lose connection, you also lose the coins! I was expecting to have an estimated 5-10 seconds to connect to a match, but this game can take 20 seconds up to a minute just to connect to a match with another player. I was able to go downstairs, pour myself a glass of water, drink it all, and successfully make it back to my computer before this game even connected to a match!You thought it ended there? I didn't mention this game has huge amounts of lag? You could hit the cue ball in the opposite dirrection of the hole, and a lag spike will bring the ball right back and give you another chance. This game crashes more than a 2 year old flying an RC Helicopter! I didn't even know it could get that bad...In conclusion... you will have an easier time getting a whale halfway across the earth than trying to play this game. Hopefully this helped you all! ;)			"

When I was doing the practice, I honestly began to wonder why these people even added a practice mode! I also wondered why this bot isn't at the top of the leaderboard... Not only that, but the practice mode always makes you hit the ball first, pretty much giving the bot a 95% chance to win without you even being able to do anything in the game! At that point, I wanted to repetitively bang my head against my desk!Shouldn't most games be able to connect you to a game or game lobby within a matter of seconds. Most games I know do that, but nooooooooo. Premium Pool not only has a huge problem connecting with other players to start a match, but it also has a problem staying connected. In order to get into a match, you have to pay coins, and if you lose connection, you also lose the coins! I was expecting to have an estimated 5-10 seconds to connect to a match, but this game can take 20 seconds up to a minute just to connect to a match with another player. I was able to go downstairs, pour myself a glass of water, drink it all, and successfully make it back to my computer before this game even connected to a match!You thought it ended there? I didn't mention this game has huge amounts of lag? You could hit the cue ball in the opposite dirrection of the hole, and a lag spike will bring the ball right back and give you another chance. This game crashes more than a 2 year old flying an RC Helicopter! I didn't even know it could get that bad...In conclusion... you will have an easier time getting a whale halfway across the earth than trying to play this game. Hopefully this helped you all! ;)			"

												I've played about 16,000 games on my miniclip 8 ball pool account. I've been dying for a game like it on steam and this seems to be the closest...The game its self is very smooth and plays as good or if not better than mini clip as the ball and cue feels a lot more 'real'.The character thing they have got going on is dumb. why would i want to pay 20,000 coins for some fat old guy.I want to see my stats and other players stats. In game options would be nice, mouse speed, mute sound etc. The chats are awful, i looked at the packs you can buy and they are also awfulThe noise!!!! - I earned money fast and wanted to play the 3000 coin game which takes a while to find another player BEEP BEEP BEEP, i play with a headset and listen to music with games like this but some of the noises that comes from the menu is horrible. All in all i do NOT recommend this game.... YET! As the game play is great but seriously Dev, you could have a much better thing going on here......			"

												EDIT is at the bottem the game improved so the new review is at the bottemI have always loved 8 ball pool and this game is pretty much the steam version except its alot more terrible it has the potential of being as good as the flash game but its not polished enough in my opinion.Pros: Its a good base game with nice features (even though they are the same as the flash game)Nice styleCons:The chat (if i want to say something to the opponent let me say it dont limit it to what you want me to say)Feels clunky playing with a mouse a keyboard often when the white ball rolled towards the edge of the table and i tried to aim it would keep picking up the ball. (seriously annoying when you have a timer about to run out)When aiming it felt like it was snapped to a certain degree. (i dont know if this was just me but it was annoying)Connection meant you would run out of time instantly after reconnection.Overall the game is decent because all of the cons are only minor and not game breaking its still enjoyable but its just not all there so i dont reccomend it. 6/10I also saw somthing interesting in the store if you want 5 new bits of text to display on screen to your challenger you can pay up to £5 is it just me who thinks thats kind of a rip off.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok so the game improved since i made the negative review and its acctually alot better now most of the cons are gone so now i would reccomend this game go play it.

												So, I started up this game... And I expected it to be like OMGPOP's billiards or facebook's billards (both of which are made in Flash). But unfortunately when I entered a game, it didn't feel like geniune billiards.It was a disappointment.When the balls collided, it didn't make the satifsying noise that pool balls make.There are only 2 avatars that are you start with: a male and a female. Both of the avatars look repulsive. The only avatar that has any appeal is the one named Meister.So in the one game that I did play, the opponent hit a stripped ball towards one of the pockets. The ball was about 0.75 pool ball lengths away from going into the pocket when it was almost at a complete stop, and then it just magically goes in. In the match, it looked like one of the balls jumped over one of the other balls. I didn't do the pratice so I did not expect to see that. It looked like the pool ball randomly jumped backwards over the ball that hit it.I ended up winning the match as expected, but it wasn't enjoyable or satisfying. The game starts you off with 250 coins/chips and it costs 50 to enter a basic match. You will feel asif there is absolutely no power being your pool stick, but you will see the balls slide across your screen. I do not like how it costs coins/chips to play the game. Sure, it would be fine to gain coins/chips when winning or losing, but you literally have to have them to play the game.I rate this game a 2/10.			"

												This is more or a less a beta game.  But, its free so, that somewhat excuses some issues.  However, connectivity seems to be an issue.  Its rather difficult to connect to players in online mode.  Apparently that is being worked on by the devs.  You start off with 250 gold coins and you can purchase more through steam.  So, to that extent, its a pay to play sort of set up.....unless, of course, you can join some of the lesser lobbies and win some GC 50 to 100 at a time.  At that rate, however, it will take quite a few games to purchase some of the low level items in the store.  As far as game play and the physics etc, its not bad.  The aiming lines help but, without them, making shots is nearly impossible without a lot of practice.....and I mean A LOT OF PRACTICE.  From what I can see, 8 Ball is the only game vairant available at this time.  I would rather have seen the game start off with 9 Ball.  But, that's really a matter of personal preference, I suppose.  Since the game is free, I will recommend it.  Its not a bad start to a game that has some decent, but, limited potential.   They really need to fix that connectivity thing if they have any hope of this game getting out of the starting gate.			"

												This game is very fun. It has its ups and downs. Here is the list:Pros: - Fun with Friends - Easy to learn- There is no pay-to-win deal- Great time-waster- Quick download- Keeps me and friends laughingCons:- Fun with Friends for an hour max- Takes too long to find a game- Everything costs a ton of in - game currencyIf I had to give this a good review, I would! It may be fun for an hour but is a great time-waster. If you dont have any friends, it is easy to pick them up.My experience:So a few friends of mine decided to pick this up after I went away for a week. When I got on they told me to download and I said , ehh, why not? So you know took about 30 seconds to download. I got on, kicked their butts then kept making the 8-ball in before I was supposed to. Kept me laughing(and a little mad), but kept me laughing. Picked up a few poles before even having 2 hours on this game, which is great! Now you dont make money against friends which is nice. So I recommend picking this game up and playing it. Give it a shot. Trust me, you will enjoy it. Most people leave negative reviews, but they're just negative people.			"

												It's a fun casual game - when you can get multiplayer to work - but it's advertised as something that it fails to live up to, and it has a lot of features that are just practically infeasible.Pros-It's free, ish*-Customizability, ish*-The actual game itself seems to operate without major issueCons*-The customization options all require excessively high amounts of coins - won through matches - or gems through store purchases. Because of the failures of multiplayer, it becomes unrealistic that a player will be able to actually customize to their wishes without having to purchase everyting with money. For a casual game.-The multiplayer is ridiculously awful. It takes forever to find an opponent, and then the server either drops before the game starts or the game will disconnect halfway through the match. Both typically result in a loss of the already limited coins, which means less gameplay time per day.-Challenge mode doesn't seem to work at all-Offline play has no AI, only 1v1 human local play.How to make Cons into Pros-Unlock all customization options, don't require purchases for them. IT'S A CASUAL-PLAY GAME!-Fix the multiplayer servers-Implement offline AI-Get rid of or fix Challenge mode			"

												This game isn't even fun at all. Basically give you where the ball will go so all you have to do is a simple line to hole and you'll win. That and it's based on in game money system to were if you loose you can't play anymore unless you spend real life money to play.  Not worth it, hard to find a decent billard/pool game that's free or one to buy they all have the lines showing you where the ball will go rather it be pure luck and best of your aiming instead of a holding hand.

												This game isn't even fun at all. Basically give you where the ball will go so all you have to do is a simple line to hole and you'll win. That and it's based on in game money system to were if you loose you can't play anymore unless you spend real life money to play.  Not worth it, hard to find a decent billard/pool game that's free or one to buy they all have the lines showing you where the ball will go rather it be pure luck and best of your aiming instead of a holding hand.

												I simply cannot recommend this game in its current state.Even if all of its issues were to be fixed, it's still a blatant rip-off of Miniclip 8 Ball Pool. One of my biggest issues with this game resides in the physics; the balls will maintain a steady pace before suddenly stopping. This kind of inconsistent mess they call movement is utterly painful. What follows is just some of my other grievances with this game, alongside some other things I feel it does reasonably well. -----------------------------------------------------------Pros:+Decent graphics+Decent soundtrack+More precise controls than Miniclip 8 Ball PoolCons:-Bad physics-Slow matchmaking-Brings nothing new to the table-Some rubber-banding, which is something I don't get in Miniclip 8 Ball Pool-----------------------------------------------------------In other words, there isn't much point to this game and I cannot see why anyone would choose this over Miniclip 8 Ball Pool. Don't torture yourself on this game unless you have a serious mental illness.			"

												What the hell is wrong with these people on here?!This game is the ONLY POOL GAME THAT EXIST on Steam which you can play on a MAC OSX! Its currently deep at night with online players in lobby! Its FREE and NOT pay to win! Controls arent that good like in Pool Nations, but at least its free, you can play on MAC online everytime, you can buy skins if you want and the physics arent that bad lik you read in other reviews. Stop making this game so bad, thats probably a reason why people dont download it.- I would pay money too, (up to 20+$) if some changes happen: Better controls, Key-bindings, Offline-Tournament with better KI and maybe improve graphics/controls.- Result:You get a free game which you can play online. It isnt pay to win but you can buy skins if you like. The controls and graphics arent that good (I SEEN WORST ON STEAM, this is OK) but who cares?! Its a simple, small poolgame and a MUST HAVE if you got Mac+Steam+like pool!Clearly recomment it: 7/10 Points			"

												A very well produced and nicely done game. Words can't even describe the graphics and the game engine is remarkable. It's such a quick game that it only took 39mins for me to connect with my dear friend, sorry misspelled it. Deer friend*.Anyways since it such a nice game that doesn't matter. The best part about it was that i disconnected in my first game causing me to lose more than my balance was. I was stuck at -100 for three hours, sry again: tree hours. After that i decided to start playing again and it was fine, Kappa. The game never opened and i recived a [VAC] ban for following McSkillets tutorials of how to glitch nametags. This game recives a weak 9/11 or 69 / 420 . Thanks for reading lol.			"

												PROSIt's freeLow spec requirementsCONSThere are much better pool games out there that are also freeBuggy and laggyMatch making takes too long even with people onlineDoesn't feel like a very good pool game in terms of physics or realism8 ball pool only no 9 ball or other game modesMany micro-transactions and ingame purchasesCan't recommend I'm afraid! Thought I'd enjoy this as it looks a lot like Mini Clip Pool the web browser game and 8 Ball the mobile phone game. Unfortunately it's not as polished and not very good. Just play those games if you want a free simple pool game.This game takes a while to find an opponent due to hardly anyone being on line I managed 3 games in 40 minutes. I lost one, won one and the other game I left because the shot clock disappeared the game lagged out and before I knew it the other played had potted 3 balls whilst I was still lining up my shot. It then got stuck on my previous shot and nothing was happening. I'm on 72mb fibre with 5-10 ping on other games, pretty bad from a game that's basically browser based.There's not really any skill involved this game unlike other pool games. The game I won I just lined up every shot and hit at full power. There isn't really any need for back spin, side spin or anything else as the physics and balls don't work that well. I know it's only overhead 2D pool but there's other pool games out there with semi or better realism. You should at least have consequence for smashing every shot without thought but I never potted the white or a wrong ball. Maybe I'll try this again after they patch it a few times but not that bothered to be honest. This could have been a cool time breaker for those odd 10-15 minutes spells when I'm patching or installing but it's terrible.			"

												THIS GAME IS A SEXIST PIECE OF GARBAGE. I played as the man character (assuming gender, i don't want to misgender someone who could identify as Optimus Prime or a toucan), and lost 20,000 to the female character at the very end. I think this is sexist pig misogynistic trash and should be taken down from the store. I was highly offended, and not only did it have TWO genders (not accounting for demi-horses like me), but it didn't even let you unlock a gender like demi-horse.			"

												Premium Pool is a free to play game of virtual 8 Ball.  It worked, played ok, sounded ok, looked ok.   Has only emotes for communication.  Looks like the stuff in the shop is cosmetic only, many things with the in-game currency.  Has male and female avatars.  For Practice, it has single player vs AI or 2 player on the same computer, with no money earned.  Online matches you with someone from the internet close to your level.  There is NO Tutorial, Instructions or Hints.   The aiming system is touchy,  best to put your cursor near the ball you are wanting to hit.  To fire and powerlevel you have a pull down stick on the right side of table. You don't get anything if you lose online match.   Every match has a Timer for each shot, make it harder.   Try it, maybe you will like it.For more info:

												4/30/2016 EDIT: I've come across yet another issue: every time I exit the game it freezes and I am forced to use the task manager to close the program. It isn't a game-breaking bug, but it's one of those small annoyances that still needs fixing.4/27/2016 EDIT: Recently I've come across another problem with this game: very frequent game freezes which usually results in me having to restart the game.(No, it is not my computer; my computer is brand new and has perfectly handled games much more sophisticated than this.) Another issue that has become increasingly common is that it is almost impossible for me to connect to the online play, so my only option is to play offline unless this fixes itself(which is very rare, despite me restarting the game several times.) I am aware that other people have connection issues with this game as well, based on other user reviews.ORIGINAL: While Premium Pool has many flaws and issues, I recommend Premium Pool despite these issues only because it is *free* and fun when the issues are not affecting your gameplay significantly. However, I do not recommend spending money on this game at all. Most(if not all) of the items purchased with real money are only for looks and cannot be profitted off of nor do they affect your performance in the game. Plus, I wouldn't spend money on this game due to some of the big issues the game has.Some of the issues I noticed in my first session playing Premium Pool:- It is nearly impossible to play against your steam friends, because the game always has trouble connecting.- Due to very few players actively online on Premium Pool, it is very common to be pinned against other players who are not anywhere near your own skill level. This can make it hard for new players by forcing them to play against the more experienced ones, and allow the more experienced players to money farm off of the newer players. This leaves the less experienced player with little to no cash left.- Lots of in-game purchases required to get almost all of the better stuff(a separate currency that can only be purchased with money is used to buy nearly all of the non-newbie gear.) However, this does not make the game pay to play. It works perfectly fine without making in-game purchases.- Looks very similar to many other ""Pool"" games all over the web with not much difference between Premium Pool and all the others.Pros:- Very fun when you get good matchmaking and don't get utterly decimated by an opponent 10 levels ahead of you.- Pretty easy to get the hang of this game, also a very relaxed and friendly environment.- Good community(from what I saw), for all the people I played against, I enjoyed menu chatting back and forth with them, especially with small taunts such as saying ""Thanks."" when they pot the cue ball.- Fun to play if you don't have enough time for more sophisticated games such as RPG's. The matches are fairly quick and a timer prevents players from taking too long on their shots.- Lots of cool looking cues, table designs, arenas and more.(Unfortunately though, most of them cost an in-game currency that can only be obtained by purchase.)I would personally recommend ""8-Ball Pool"" by Miniclip which can be found both online and on the App Store. It's basically this but stepped up about five levels with minigames, great matchmaking, easy multiplayer against friends & family and different cues & ranks that offer not only just cooler looks but more speed, power, and so on.I hope any readers take my review into consideration! :D			"

												Premium Pool Review – Raymond KTI like pool; I really do but games like this ruin the experience. The reason why I wouldn't recommend this game is that the game has some major bugs and ''glitches''. I and my friend found a bug that makes your opponent's time run out even if he shot the ball. The speed is terrible. Even with max speed the ball doesn't move that quickly as it should to actually hit bank shots. The game is copy of 8ball pool but the creators said that they are going to add new game modes such as 9ball. I know those glitches might not be glitches in your opinion but we tested the time runout glitch with 2 over 200mbps download and 50mbps upload nets with 5-7 ping. The ''bags'' you are hitting balls are WAYYYYY too big, seems like the game has box colliders. Just play “8 Ball Pool” by Miniclip instead, it’s a lot more worth it and you can find matches easier.It’s just a failed copy of 8 Ball Pool.Literally everything is copied from 8 ball pool, except one important thing: physics. It has the worst reality in every pool games i played. The balls go with a incredible speed and suddenly they stop in the middle of the table, the movements aren't real at al...Even if you shoot with medium force it stops in the middle of the target making you have to shoot with max force when it shouldn't be supposed to.Also the fact that the minimum value you have to play is 50 coins and you start with 250 coins makes you with short selection of choices when you start to play and , in a low quantity of games you can lose everything , even with the lowest entry possible. Other thing is bugs when you are searching for a game and it suddenly goes down , one time it even consumed my 50 coins because a match was found and i was redirected to the main menu. It’s not a bad game, but I think there are better ones out there. (my opinion) "

												Good for 5 mins if you really want a game of pool Th UI needs work , there is no game browser , you cant see who else is looking for a game in a big lobby Its just a little too easy to get the ruler out and check the angle .Just a lack of a decent multi player room system and the aiming system is a little fiddly			"

												Okay. First review I've ever done on Steam. This game, though having the looks of a Candystand arcade, is strangely addictive. No in-game chat, but a starting set of dialogue with the ability to unlock new dialogue. The game has been getting better as more people play, as the servers have been fairly quiet since release. Even as a free game I've not yet been bombarded with ads of any sort, and navigating menus and in/out of game couldn't possibly be easier. Great billiards game for those of you not looking for a simulator. 10/14- just 'cause.			"

												If you have this game on medium graphics it seems to connect better with other players. My computer can handle high graphics, but it will always disconnect a player, aside from that it's a good ""warm up"" billiards game if you like online billiards, not too difficult but it can be a bit of a challenge depending on where the balls are places. For those who are starting out on a billiards online game, I would recommend this, keep in mind of the medium settings for graphics and you should connect easier :)			"

												An example of a pay wall game done right.  While I don't think it's that groundbreaking of a game, it doesn't stop you from playing after a while, forcing you to pay to continue, which I can appreciate.  You CAN buy things in game with real money if you're impatient, but you can also EARN coins in game to do the same.What else i there to say other than the classic game of pool has never been better.  Sadly, I do have to dock it because it is still a microtransaction game, but the things you can buy are purely cosmetic and don't change the overall feel.  THAT IS HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE!Do I recommend it though?  Well, if you like a simple game that you can pick up and play without having to learn a whole textbook of rules, then you really can't get much simpler and classic than pool.  So yes, I do recommend this one for any pool enthusiast or casual gamer.  I'd even recommend it to the hardcore gamers who may need a break from their edgy games.			"

												The game is not bad, but multiplayer stinks, it's always disconneting the opponent before the game can be finished.Update: Since the update, I have not had any issues with disconnects!			"

												I installed this game, hoping to be able to play within the same night. I timed how long it took to join a match, and waited 10 minutes. Still no match. I can't even give any details about the game, because I was never able to play it. Worthless. The un-install button worked, though..			"

												Don't get me wrong. This game is fun. But it's only fun when the matchmaking queue actually works. I play the game, get into matchmaking, then it tries to connect to the game and works for a split second, then back into the queue. Bad game overall.			"

												Hard to connect to and disconnects when it actually does get a game and you lose credits. I think they do it on purpose to sucker you into making micro-transactions. I wouldn't suggest playing this at all. I have been playing pool games online since 1998 and this is one of the more annoying.EDIT:I decided to give this another try since they did a bunch of updates. Now it won't even open correctly, just crashes. Whomever made this game needs not to be allowed to make games anymore.New Edit: A bunch of updates so I figured I would give it a try again. Still utter crap. If you are going to have a ball to set English on might want to have it actually able do that...Now the game won't close without crashing either. Seriously the devs of this just need to stop and delete this garbage.Edit: 8/10/16 Can't play if no one is there to play with.			"

												I love pool in real life and I kinda have mixed feelings about this free to play game. I mean way to little people play it, the matches get dole in 2 minutes and its easy to put in the balls. But I still kinda like and I kinda recomend it			"

												This pool game is ok but it provides a timer in practice that you cant disable. I understand it is for online play but when you are just messing around you should be able to play without time in practice mode			"

												You guys could make something like a better ranking system cuz my first match was with a 26 level guy and guess what, i lost. Second match was with a 16 level guy and i lost almost all my money. Better playing this game on facebook. 2/10 i would give my money to a 26 level guy.			"

												I was using this for learning Korean, however, it doesn't teach you sentences, only words of items. A feature I'd like to see is for it to generate sentences to help further your learning of a foreign language.However, for some basic learning of items I can recommend it, anything is better than nothing.
