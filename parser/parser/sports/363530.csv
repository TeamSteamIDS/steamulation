												I made a review before this a few days into early access, and if you want a TL;DR I'll paraphrase one of my previous lines - buy into it if you're fine with being an alpha tester. I am. It's flawed, but fun.So as Robot Arena III rolls into a full release, it must be considered that the devs themselves say that it's more of a tactical move to bring it out of early access, what with the Steam summer sale approaching fast. But I'm not here to knock their sales strategy.Having a binary recommendation option is tough for some games; this is one of them. To recommend it right this moment as a full release title would be to grossly overrate it's current quality and depth of content. The physics aren't all there as a simulation game, with bad collision physics in certain circumstances and with certain components. Components can still be placed anywhere without any boundaries. The career mode does not reset when all of the tournaments have been finished. There's a bug where the camera won't stop moving up or down in the bot lab after battling some AI opponents that should have been swatted by now.But to not recommend it would be to downplay the monumental effort the devs have been undertaking in the last 4 weeks to improve the game. The first day of early access the game was considered 'full', and it was a mess. You couldn't even build a wedge shaped robot because every robot had box collisions. Now you can. The biggest drive motors would make your robot flip on the spot like one of those toy backflipping dogs unless it weighed as much as a star. Now they don't. Weight classes are back. Should all of these things been in the game on day 1? Absolutely. But they also could have just dumped the game there and then and moved on. They haven't. I respect that.They have good ideas. The 5 layer chassis system is great for rounded shapes or crafting detail. Being able to move components after placing them is one of the best quality of life improvements they could have made after RA2. Someone on Gametechmods[www.gametechmods.com] figured out how to mod the game, even if it's crude at the moment, so a modding community is imminent. Robot Arena III will be great. It's just not 'great' this second.			"

												I really didn't want to write this review. I'd been one of the more vocal people in the discussions, offering advice on bugs that needed fixing, as well as features I feel should be added/restored. I even emailed these directly to the dev team's preferred email address. I've been tough on the game, but I always hoped that the developers would prove me wrong, that they would update this game into something that humiliates Robot Arena 2.But they instead released it out of Early Access in a buggy, unfinished state and we're approaching two months of not hearing a word from them, unless they are secretly building a big update I feel its safe to say the game is dead.Lets go over just some of the issues.Firstly, the physics are broken. Robot Arena 2 could have issues sometimes but firstly the game is 13 years old, and secondly they weren't as bad at this 2016 release. There was many a time when I would see robots take off seemingly into orbit from the smallest tap.Secondly the glitches are everywhere. Bot building is broken, I don't have to have parts connect to anything and they will still work fine. I can have parts clipping into each other and the game sees no problem with this. When I play Robot Arena 2 they wouldn't let this happen.Robot Arena 2 also wouldn't let me break the career mode, in Robot Arena 3 when it updated a robot that I had built was set to the U class, I cant edit the bot to change it and the tournaments it was in are now impossible to finish. I also found out after deleting a different robot that that one was in a tournament, making that one impossible to finish. Robot Arena 2 has a weight limit and doesn't let you delete robots that are in a tournament in career mode. Robot Arena 2 is 13 years older.The game is way too loud, and the sound is overall a mess. No matter what I do to tinker with the sound it remains for me at the sound level of a Freddy Fazbear jump scare. Plus the game cant handle many sounds at once, I've had many times where because a lot was happening the music would cut out.There is no weight to any attacks in this game, in Robot Arena 2 if I smash a battle axe down onto an opponent, it hits hard. It feels satisfying to destroy opponents that way, but in Robot Arena 3 the hits are far less satisfying, and weapons seem to snap off if you so much as breathe next to them.The only thing I can truly say Robot Arena 3 has over Robot Arena 2 is in the customisation, and even then I'd recommend getting a modded copy of Robot Arena 2 for more tools to play with. They've had a lot of work put into them, and help to keep a 13 year old game fresh even today. (There is even an ongoing mod called the official robot wars mod, its worth checking out!). Also Robot Arena 3 does look better, but I would be disgusted if it didnt look better visually.All in all, just look for a free download of Robot Arena 2, instead of paying Â£15 for this game. Its nowhere near finished and it likely never will be finished which is probably the most insulting thing, as they deemed this ready for a full release and took it out of early access. If things turn around I will update this review, but I'm not holding out for much hope.			"

								First time I ever disliked something that bad that im refunding, The game is really really early and not finished to even be considered early alpha.I would recommened all fans of the previous games to stay away from it until all the basics are finished. Everything just feels so bad. no options outside of the launcher.Some of the noise and models are from Robot arena 2, controls to create the robots are horribly designed for consoles in mind rathar than Pc.Graphicly feels like a really old game. but i can say the game preforms nicely.For now i would say to AVOID it, wait it out and see if it fixes most of the problems any Early access game has.

								Needs lots of work as the game is early access, but you can build some pretty funky stuff then drive it around.Was a huge fan of RA2, and so far have been a huge fan of RA3.Lots of freedom to build to your heart's content. You can build some completely unrealistic abominations that make absolutely no sense, then blame it on the game developers, or you can build some really neat stuff. The freedom may allow cheating, per se, but it can also allow you to make some complicated contraptions, art, replicas, or things that were only possible through exploits or cheat components in RA2.You can build totally IRL, or you can freely build completely unrealistic without the use of exploits.

												It is with great regret that I post a No Review. Robot Arena III is not finished yet. For a ""released game"" it is on par with Sword of the Stars II. There are some great ideas and vast improvements on the orriginal, but it is not a complete game yet. This game never should have left early access in its current state.Good:-Excellent improvements on the RA2 designing system-Complete chassis customizability-Loads of parts and weapons to make truely unique machines of death!-Freaking ROBOT AREANA 3 !!!!!Bad:-Not pollished at all-Bugs in the bot editor-Very buggy physics-Sometimes your bot just implodes when you load it into the arena-No LAN multiplayer ?!?!-No editor undo button "

								This game has improved massively in the two short weeks since it's release. Don't get me wrong, it's still far from perfect, but the potential that this game has is very clear, and in it's current state, the game is actually quite fun to play. I know a lot of people, myself included, were very skeptical of the devs of this sequel to what can be described as a 'cult classic' game, but so far they have shown that they are willing to continue supporting the game and listening to the fans of Robot Arena, both here and on the GameTechMods forums despite the negative feedback that the game (mostly deservedly) recieved in it's first week of release. That, in itself is commendable.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a huge fan of Robot Arena 2. when i saw for the first time RA3 on Steam, I wasn\'t scared by the negative reviews. I was sure that, yes, the game needed some work, but i was also convinced that the game was really fun....I was incredibly wrong.I know, I know, the game is still in early access, but there are a lot of basics problems that not only need to be solved, but changed.Starting to the bot lab. Ok, now you really have the complete possibility to create any, ANY shape for the robots, but the price to pay is too high. The way you modify the chassis is really too difficult. I had trouble even with simple robot desings, the multiple layers scheme is far from being clear. But there is more...Mounting the parts can be really frustrating. The process is really slow, I don\'t get why the parts must to be mounted in a \""standard\"" position UNDER the chassis, and then, repositioned where we want. But i like the idea of moving mounted parts, this really is an useful thing. I do not like the way you wire the motors/pistons in RA3. it works in the opposite way of RA2, I found it too messy. But maybe it\'s just me. Ok, time to try our new, fresh built robot, right?....Right?No. For no reason, the physics of the game decided to punch herself with all of his might, resulting in a complete DISASTER.Without touching any key, my robot started to bounce illogically all along the arena. Any attempt to stop it was useless.I\'ve tried to add weight, add more wheels, everything. But no, nothing changed. The only thing i could do was delete the bot and build a new one. In the nex time i\'ve tried different things. I\'ve tried to save space putting motors and wheels outside the chassis (mounted properly with extenders), but for no reason the back of the bot started to bounce. Another scrap. I\'ve also found that you can overlap parts. I was able to put 5 batteries in the same place. You can\'t see a thing like that in a 2016 game.Then i\'ve tried to build a robot in the style of \""Chaos 2\"": 2 big motors at the FRONT (ztech HP) to avoid wheelies, light and with a short wheelbase: a functional design in RA2 and in the real life. But what happened next got me mad.Not only there is an exaggerated, insane amount of centrifugal force generated by the motors (that also spin at ridiculous low speed, considering that\'s the most powerful motor of the game) but the centrifugal force does not change even when  the motors are spinning at max speed. The result?Trying to go forward, my robot started to continuosly roll over backward. I was crying inside me.Without hope, i built the last robot.  Big, heavy, slow, but functional.Then i\'ve tried to battle. Sad. Really sad. A lot of sounds are missing, visual effects like fire and sparks are exaggerated and badly done. When you hit your opponent, you don\'t fell like you are hitting it, but you fell like you are pushing, or bouncing on it. You don\'t feel that you are damaging it, you don\'t see the deformations on the chassis, you don\'t see and feel nothing. The only thing that remains is a slow, sad, frustrating game.I hope that this can help the developers. In those contitions, i can\'t play the game without getting mad. BUT.I see potential. I think this could be a really funny game in the future, but things need to be changed. I wish good work to the developers. Maybe in a few months i will be back, to see if something changed. Like me, a lot of people care about this game.			"

												I have played many build and battle games, as well as Robot Arena 2. I had figured this would be an improved version of RA2. After playing around with the game for a few nights and trying to give it the best chance i could, I have to say that Robot Arena 3 has worse graphics, controls, physics, and overall quality is horrible in comparision to the others in the series (which in themselves were not the greatest games but at least playable). I was excited when i saw that there was a new version of one of my old Favorites I just hope they will consider a refund. Here are some of the problems (in my opinion):- Incredibly unrealistic in everyway possible. - Gives no sense of immersion into the real life Robot Battling world.- When building your robot, the builder allows for clipping of parts.- The weapons do not interact properly with other robots.- Sometimes the robots just bug out and ""fly"" around the map.- The scale of the robots and arenas are WAY off giving it a cartoony feel.- The ""high speed"" motors seem to be 1/3 the speed of the previous games.- Frequent game crashes (all updates done, computer is more than powerful enough to run a ""Fantanstic"" lvl.- Game glitches can cause your robot to become corrupt. (things like parts disapearing, robots becoming unusable. because they are locked in a battle that is not compatible with the robot. - Texture files are worse than N64 games. - Points system is badly designed and seems to not reflect actual damage. - Damage is not even close to realistic. - Camera angles make for very difficult combat. (even with the addition of a mountable camera)Overall one of the worse Build & Battle games ever played. (Enough for me to write a review just to prevent others from making the same mistake). DO NOT BUY.			"

								I don't know how I feel...  Alright, I'll be honest, I'm in denial that this game is like biting into a big, meaty, tasty looking juicy burger only to find out it's made of wax.  I'm sorry devs, but... This was not ready to show the public yet.  I've waited literally half my life for this sequal, and I could have waited another 6 months.In building my bot, it's almost impossible to line up parts.  I would rather the rotation snap 5 degrees per click (AND ONLY ON A CLICK... This ""tap the mouse button as quickly as possible because a split second longer and it rotates 30 degrees"" sucks).  Additionally, lining up parts without at LEAST some sort of a 3D grid is all but impossible.  In RA2 I could build the bot I just built in 10min.  It just took me 2 hours to get things lined up.The interface is... well, not pretty, that's for sure.  I don't really mind that, as it's kinda like going back in time to my 13 year old self playing RA2 on my old Windows XP cheap rig.  But I can see where others would think ""Was this game developed in VB6?""Devs... I WANT to trust you all will fix these issues.  I WANT to believe that this will fill my inner child with glee.  But... The fact that you let others see this game, or even pay for it, in this state...  Guys, pay your bills with my money and get on this, ok?  For me?  It honestly reminds me of my first projects in Unity but with a better UI and more overall polish... That's not a compliment... I'm no god of programming...My advice?  Guys, wait a few months if you want a polished game.  If this is your dream as much as it was mine, buy it now, show the devs we want it to be better, but realize that if you expect it to live up to RA2 with modern graphics in this state, it will feel like getting a Fatboy Tire shoved up your â¥â¥â¥â¥.

												The optimization on this game seems to be terrible thus far, I'm getting dreadful framerates during gameplay despite my computers resources barely being used up (bearing in mind I'm using a laptop), peaking at around 25% RAM usage and 40% cpu usage. (I also had the graphics quality set to 'fastest' and the lowest possible resolution)The resolution on this game doesn't fit the window screen when reduced I've also noticed, and framerates during menus/botlab can be clunky. Components also have a nack for rotating when selected without being prompted to do so.One last gripe, when I click 'continue' when attempting to enter career mode nothing happens.Now for the positive, I do like the seemingly endless possibilities in bot creation and not having to start all over if my chassis is too big/small. It's also good that you can rotate components (even with components connected to them) after placing and not having to remove other components and so on.I think the game has the potential to be a very enjoyable robot sim providing it's gameplay issue are dealt with accordingly.

								This game is far from perfect, but I think it is heading in the correct direction. There needs to be a few more improvements however, I think that when the physics are fixed and robots stop jumping up for no reason, you should be able to flip robots 'Out of the arena' I also think there should be more variety in the extra weapons (such as longer wedges) I also believe that users should be able to make their own maps and import them easily into Robot Arena III (Such as another section for arenas from the workshop, just like the workshop bots)So do I think you should get this game?Of course I do!

												Building a bot that exceeds the Heavy bot weight limit will cause the bot to be locked out without warning if you enter it into a competition.  Once you finish a career through all the open tournements, there is no way to restart with a different bot.  The only way right now seems to be delete your team or start a new team.  There are no collision boxes or warnings when building your bot. This can cause you to inadvertently place compents in an overlapping state which can make the bot to go into perpetual self destruct when entering the workshop and causing the game to lock out the buttons.  The only way out is to force quit the application. You can actually place components outside your bot with no contact with the chassis at all. Some components have a certain mass but when you attach to the bot its actually 20X heavier causing your bot change weight classes with the addition of one item.  There is no repairing of bots between matches like the original RA2 version. Very few settings to allow you to customize the game.  The chase camera is so slow you have to sit still and wait for it to catch up to you or drive blind. The attach buttons in the workshop are so large that they overlap and it makes it difficult to click the one you want.  Many times you have to remove the component, change the view angle and try again.   This is my first steam game I acatully wanted to get a refund on.  I wasn't aware of the 2 hour play time limit on games for return so I was not able to return it.  If I had known about the return policy I would have returned the game after 10 minutes of play time.   I think steam should remove this game from the game list and force the developers to refund money to anyone who purchased the game thinking it would be like RA2.  Save your money, don't buy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								In its current early access state, I can't recommend the game, simply because it's no better, and probably worse than its predecessor, which, due to it being abandonware is totally free. This sounds like a very harsh thing to say, but unfortunately with steam early access, you never really know if the game will ever come out of it.Everything about the game is worse really. The physics on the robots are inconsistent, despite the newer engine. It makes fighting the robots feel a bit off. You might hit a guy with a spinning disc and have him not move, then he might drive into a wall and that'll be a much larger 'impact.' I didn't use a wedge, but I'm told the chassis of the robot actually makes no difference, ie, if you make a wedge you can't get under people. I can't confirm that. The building has been 'simplified' to the point where it trades ease of use for clunkiness. For instance, if you try to add a 'peg board' to the edge of a disc, there's about 15 attach points on one side, and 3 on the other. You have to click change attach point about 15 times, as opposed to just clicking the attach point you want, then on the motor. It's just not streamlined at all, and I can put everything inside eachother. Next, huge lack of parts. The variety dropped pretty hard in general. There isn't enough weapon motors and the best one isn't strong enough. Moving on, lack of part clarity, none of the motors say how much electricity they draw, as far as I can tell. The armor doesn't necessarilly say how effective it is. Is fibreglass going to give me more or less health than carbon fibre? Something about fire resistance? On a side note, the music is annoying, the sound effects are low quality and just sound weird, and some are ripped from the old game. The graphics, while not that important, are pretty awful. Somehow even though the textures are higher quality, they are just worse looking than the old game. It's hard to explain. They just look like typical stock unity textures, it looks odd and cartoony. I'm sure you'll get the same feeling when you look at the screenshots. I think it's to do with the lighting. For me, a robot building/fighting game where the building isn't great and the fighting is plagued by weird physics isn't worth the buy. Wait until full release, then look at the reviews again.  "

								The game is not even in beta-ready stage. Core mechanics are broken, the physics engine is very poor, you can exploit the parts layout cause there is no collisions inside the bot. The graphics are on par with RA2 from 2003, it even uses parts from it. Uniti engine feels cheap and typical 'indie'. Game lacks the hot-seat feature from RA2! And the overall damage model with rpg-style 'popping numbers' seems very inapropriate.Very, very disappointed.			"

												This game has a ton of potential, but you shouldn't buy it now.Devs took it out of early release for the summer sale, but it was a bad move. This game is nowhere near completed. The career mode sometimes just takes your bots and won't work. You can't retry a career level. There is no apparent restriction to how you build your bot. Weapons clip through your robot completely. Sometimes when you test your robot, it just explodes and the save file is broken from there on.That being said, the robot builder and actually fighting other robots are fun. Downloading robots from the workshop is a lot of fun, too. There is just no real game to play yet.Don't buy this if you want an actual game, but if you really like battlebots or something it can be fun. The wonky physics can be hilarious if that's any consolation.EDIT: After playing this for quite some time, I have found a lot more to like (online battles, designing bigger robots), but I have found even MORE bugs that require me to edit json saves to fix, etc. This is being advertised as a completed game. If the developers were to move this game back into early access, however - which is objectively where it belongs - then I would change this review to recommend it.TL;DR - This is an early access game in disguise. Don't buy it if you expect a completed game.			"

								Things that have happened while playing the game:- The menu cursor became stuck going down- My robot randomly flipped over due to wonky physics- My robot fell through the floor- My robot broke immediately at the start of a match- I moved a robot part under the table in the bot lab and could not click on it anymore- My opponent's robot cloned itself in multiplayer twice in the same match- An extra blank robot appeared in multiplayer- I attempted to join a server that no longer existed, thus softlocking the game because there is no option to close the message- I pressed the ready button in a server and nothing happened- The game crashed every other time I tried to play a multiplayer match- The game crashed my opponent's entire computer- I contemplated what went wrong in my life that led me to playing this gameThis is the Big Rigs of robot building simulators.

								Stay very clear of this cheap cash in. They seem to be using stock textures in places, I know for a fact one menu background in particular is litterally lifted off of google images without editing. The music is bad, the AI is bad, the announcer has better â¥â¥â¥â¥ to do...So much potential, squandered on a dev that doesn't seem to care about the combat or building of robots. They managed to get so very close to how the old games were, but a few critical features are quite simply missing. Rotation snap, for one is a feature you'll be very sorely missing in the builder. The part variety is pitiful. The physics are muted. You can't break off wheels, for some reason. Circular Saws are halariously overpowered for a weapon that is typically useless against everything in real life. Deformation of chassis and frames and armor and anything else you've come to expect from Robot Arena 2 is simply not present. I tried to build a flipper. They didn't even have a flat panel for me to build it with, so I used two battleaxes. The strongest burst motor in the game can't manage to lift another bot. I tried to get clever with part placement, but my parts disentegrated without warning. I think its clipping protection, but why did they allow me to place it in the first place? I was really excited for this realease, and given that its an indie team I was willing to forgive a lot. But the shear amount of inept design and slapdash... everything leads me to believe that this was a project done in a few months in someone's spare time.			"

								Do not buy:I will say from playing both the RA1 and RA2 series that this game is even more flawed then the two combined, as I know it is in early access the amount of glitches and physics put into this game make it seem that it was produced with no trail and error what so ever. For example, a subway train runs you over, nothing happens. you drive in molten steel, nothing happens, you hit a wall, you fly across the arena and lose all your wheels. I'm going back to RA2 until they actually make this a decent game that is worth buying right not its just bells and whistles with better graphics but absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay.			"

								A sad day for RA fans.Its obvious this game was made to cash in on the fact that Battlebots is now back on air.The game is low quality and feels rushed. There are gameplay problems that werent existent in RA2. The stock bots are built in such a way they clip through there own components during firing. Wacking a wall sends your bot flying.Options within pause menu does nothing.In MP I was unable to start a session after 20 minutes. People join and dont ready up, you create a lobby for 2 players and 3 join. Theres no option to kick anyone, no servers appeared for me but people did join mine. The controls are setup for console for some reason. Icons are terrible quality and the whole game is under 400mb. Component selection is lacking. Really dissapointed by this, had very high hopes but this game exists only to take advantage of a re-emerging community.			"

Difficult to build robots, you will spend hours adjusting angles of components, which gives a nice degree of customization, but at least allow a snap-to feature for angles6. Multi-link mechanisms, to allow for a ""see-saw"" typle mechanism in order to generate more torque from an actuator (building Razor not possible)7.

												This is the first of the robot arena series I have not embraced fully. The physics are unrealistic and buggy, the opponents are defeated with minimal effort and employ no strategy (a simple ram bot with a few spikes easily dominates competitions vs AI), and the damge system is simply disappointing. Striking weapons out-of-plane (relative to their intended damage direction) results in damage to the striking weapon. Robots buck with apparently massive torque, yet quickly reach speed caps, regardless of total power to weight ratio. In comparison to Robot Arena 2, this game is a disgrace.

												As a player of robot arena 2 and a builder of real 60 lb combat robots I have some complaints. The robot editor is horrible compared to RA2's bot editor. They don't have real bots to fight against and the parts are somewhat unrealistic. The paint job in the editor dose not even work. It needs improvement but is OK.EDIT: There has been no update for this game for a while, and unless the developers are trying to keep a big update hidden or something, I think that they have given up on this game. Instead of getting this game, get Robot Arena II wit DSL 2.2 for FREE instead. The robot editor is still bad, the RA2 physics engine is actually better because there are fewer crazy bugs in it. I think that this game should have stayed in early access, and not left to full release because of how buggy it still is..			"

								The game has potential, lots of it. I would say in the exhibition mode, we should be allowed to play against the ai bots. The bot lab also needs an undo button in case you mess up and want to undo something. The paint shop would be cool with in-game decals, and while painting, be able to paint wither one side, or all the sides of choosing, and be able to see what is colored/not. What would also be great is the meshes bending, breaking, even attack decals like in RA2. I def. would love to see the meshes bend, cave in, and even melt depending on what armor it has. But so far, the game is good. I would love to see several changes, but the game has a lot of potential, and can become one hell of a great game. I do recommend it actually, cause it still is somewhat fun, but it would be a lot better with the changes i listed.			"

								In the State Robot Arena III is in, it is not worth your money because of the sheer amount of technical issues it currently has.The Botlab is nonfuctional because you cannot snap parts into items you place inside the robot, something that is essential in creating robots with this system, creating robots has also been slown way down and it's now much more akward to quickly prototype and test your robot designs with clipping detection is nonexistent allowing multiple parts to be placed inside eachother and breaking the the last resemblance of ""realism"" this game has. In the space that I was building ZeroZero I could have easily made 2 perfectly good combat machines in Robot Arena 2 that would have won me the Golden Sawblade!The artstyle is ugly and very non-realisic with many of the arenas looking much bigger than they do on the screenshots and many of the textures looking plascticky and very visully unrealistic, something that Robot Arena 3 really should have kept from Robot Arena 2 was the pseudo-real-but-liberties-where-taken method from THAT game.with the AI being very simple and easy to defeat with it somehow being worse than Robot Arena 2 with the ability to even defeat robots by completly standing still because all they do is charge at you head-first without any reguard of any pitfalls that may get in the way!That and the framerate was very inconsistent, averaging 18 in the Botlab with a GTX 950 and it dropping all over the place whenever I hit another robot with one of the stock 8 and particle effects flying all over the place for absolutly no reason why.On top of the glitched UI splitting the screen in half diagonally and not allowing me to pick the stuff to the right when choosing robots, arenas and tournaments.Don't get this even for the bad quality of the game, it â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off so much that I'm getting myself a refund.

												I love Battlebots and Robot Combat but this game is terrible. I'm hoping the team can come up with some updates in the future to salvage this. I loved Robot Arena 2 and spent countless hours with it. Robot Arena III  has the same components as RA2 but it is formated in a confusing, unorganized mess. This game will do nothing but frustrate you and make you return to RA2. I cannot begin to say how disappointed I am with this.			"

												I played the original Robot Arena I think back when XP was new. That game was super fun, super easy to get into.I can't say the same about this one. I understand that it's been 2 long generations since I've played it. But this game gives no instruction on where to start, or even how to go about it. I simply can't get into it. I'd say if you can figure out how to play then it would be a blast. Do I personally recommend it? Nah, but you should definetly try it despite what I say about it, you might get hte hang of it where I couldn't. My only gripe is not enough instruction.			"

												Until this game is in a playable state, this review shall remain as not recomended. It's been a bit over a month since this game was released to apparently capatalize on the Summer Sale, and the only word about continued development has been a thread about the developers watching the discussion board. Why is it not recomended? It's a buggy, wonky mess that needs a lot of work, the UI is a bit of a mess, and we need an Undo button on the editor. The builder is difficuilt to use, fighting is down to the luck of the phyisics engine, and there isn't enough content or reasons to play it past a single match. EDIT: It's now nearing the end of August. Still nothing. A game can always be fixed, but Robot Arena 3 isn't looking like it will be. Either the Developers have run out of money (which explains the desperate move to release before the summer sale) or they have given up due to the Mostly Negitive status on steam. Untill the developers put some effort into fixing the core game, stay well clear.			"

								A drastic mistep from Robot Arena 2, Robot Arena 3 fails to improve on the problems of that game and only creates more in this confusing mess of a game. Robot creation is screwed up horrifically this time round. From the horrible new chasis building tool, to the terrible controls when actually building the robot and putting the parts in, you'll be lucky if you actually get your robot to be built the way you want it to be.Honestly, you're better off saving your money and downloading Robot Arena 2, and its real sequel the Robot Wars mod, which can both be found easily online for free.

								Gonna wait and see what the GameTechMods community does with this. I bought it within five minutes after release. So much of this game feels unfinished it isn't funny. Wonky controls, very unintuitive UI, and no way of knowing the stats on any components or armor you put on until you put them on and try it are just the start of a long list of things wrong.On a brighter note, I am happy with the chassis designer. It isn't perfect, but it has more features than the older one and when given some time to understand it, it seems like it will do a good job. I like the arenas and component selection as well. The RA2 weapons and motors are a good nostalgic touch. I would have gladly waited more time for this game to be better put together. If this was labelled as an alpha build instead of ""almost finished"", I wouldn't be so angry. I decided not to refund the game because I want to see if anything will be done to fix this game. For everyone else, be cautious about buying it.			"

Early Access Review
								At the time I'm writing this, it had been released for a couple of hours and I have played it for just under two hours.  And as much as I love the idea of the reboot, it feels dated.  And sluggish.  I just wish there'd be faster motors, real life robots such as England's own Warhead or America's Bite Force, and a way to make your own drive train, so you can legitimately make either a push bot, or a faster spinner for your robot, or a drum weapon.  On top of that, the motors only seem to point forward when you first put them in, making it a real hassle to make the robot move forward properly.  A majority of the robots in the game as well just feel haphazardly put together as well, with blade spam all over them.Pros:+ It's a nostalgic return to the Robot Arena series.+ Arcade like, and super quick loading times+ Axe like weapons feel like they can deliver a punch.Cons: (Oh boy this is going to be long)- Customisation feels rather limited.- No faster motors or powerul motors.- Spinners feel like and look like a wet noodle.- No real life robots in the game right now.- Preset chassis are small and unvaried.- One graphic on a robot replaces all graphics on all robots.  Not sure if a glitch or really poor design.- Making low profile robots makes awful clanking noises.- Graphics on some styles of robot stretches and makes it look ugly as sin.What I would like to see in the future of this game:*FASTER MOTORS: I want to be able to create a hard hitting spinner bot or a robot that uses a drum weapon and still keep its ability to ram into opponents quickly.*REAL ROBOTS: I wish to see robots old and new in the game.  Whether or not this'll happen is something completely different.*ACTUAL STATS ON ROBOT PARTS: One thing I have noticed is there's a lack of info on parts.  If this gets updated I'd be fairly okay with it.*A DRIVE TRAIN SYSTEM: Having a steering column is nice and all but I would love to make a robot that can steer on a six pence without having to fiddle with motor positioning.  On top of that, I'd love to see a choice between either belt or chain drive, for those who wish to make a robot on a tank drive steering system.*DIFFERENT FORMS OF LOCOMOTION: Wheels are cool, but tank tracks, Walking legs, or even a Half track system would be excellent.*WEIGHT CATEGORIES: Right now, all the robot seem to be in the same kind of weight category, which is quite misleading.*MORE ARENAS!!!: Can't stress that enough right now.  Being in a real arena would be fantastic, such as the old Robot Wars arena or the new Battlebots Battle box.Overall, this feels really outdated and in need of some more work, if I'm brutally honest Octopus Tree.  It doesn't feel polished, and it feels a little rushed on top of that.  Unless this game gets a really big update and pretty much changes the game into a much more customisable game that actually feels like I'm making a robot, then I'd say avoid this for now.A really disappointing start for such a promising game!

								The Bot Lab is more interesting. It's more complicated, but it gives room for a bigger variety when it comes to robots. At least for the chassis. The size of the parts is... not a good balance. The motors I find too small and the batteries too big. There isn't enough of a variety of parts. Yet. The placement of the parts start below the bottom of the chassis instead of at the bottom of the chassis like RA2 does. The physics aren't the best, and it's pretty slow. The robots are particularly slow. There needs to be some motors that have something like a chain drive/belt drive with it instead of only direct drive. This is probably a common complaint, but the parts don't have to be inside the chassis or attached to the chassis at all for some reason. The game overall has a lot of potential. The Lab has some great ideas particularly, but this is a very unpolished and unfinished game. I'm hoping for it to improve soon. As of now, to my dismay, I can't recommend the game to anyone though			"

												After waiting years and years for another Robot Arena game to come out, this one definitely did not live up to it's predecessor. The physics are way off (not using Havoc tech anymore), the components are not as great, and the robot design is way more complicated than before. That's just naming a few of the problems. It says this game is in full release mode, but this should've been numbered as 1.5 rather than 3. I thought of giving it a chance despite the comments, but I wasted $13.00 on the game and now they raised the price. Highly regret buying this title.			"

								Pros: It's a new Robot Arena.Cons: It's not as good as Robot Arena 2 at the moment.Building a bot: Parts are intangible, this makes construction easy but unrealistic.  Painting the bot is nearly impossible unless you use a cube shape for the body.  There are tons of custom button assignments for the controller giving you complete control over the weapons and attachments.Fighting the bot: The AI bots need a lot of work, they aren't aggressive enough.  The bodies don't seem to show damage very well.  The matches are over way too quickly, usually less than 30 seconds.Overall: The game has great potential and receptive developers, I can't wait to see how it progresses.			"

								     I probably log ged thousands of hours in RA2, and I loved it.  I was very very worried this one would wind up being a sad rehash or a 15 dollar clone of RA2 but I was pleasently surprised.  Yes, this is an unfinished version with alot of problems, but they're still working on it and once the bugs are ironed out I can seen this being a worthy follow-up     Just the fact that now I can move components, even when their linked, makes design so much easier.  Right now positioning the components are fiddly, I'm hoping they'll tightne this up a bit.  The new components are great, chainsaws were saddly missing form the original, and even though Chainsaws are useless in real robotic combat, getting the option to use one is great.  Also, the inclusion of barrel components is a good addition.  When RA2 was released barrel spinners were faily new but now that they're established in the sport throwing them in is great.     Again, this is pre-release, so threre are alot of problems.  Right now the program is pretty unstable, and I can see a hundred small fixes that would make this game alot better.  Hopefully the developers won't let these problems slide, because I'm excited for the future of this game.			"

												Hey, have been keeping up with the updates for RA III, and things continue to improve. I saw BattleBots last night, and RAIII does an awesome job of allowing creation of bot designs similar to the show. Whoever the team is putting this together - keep it up! The UI takes some getting used to, and a smidgen glitchy, but, with all the features packed into the game, am very impressed with how much it allows me to do. Ready for the tournaments!!Past review comments.I've not played any of the older RA games, and was a bit uncertain of what to expect for RAIII. So far, I've really liked exploring the BotLab setup - lots of different ways to create and configure my bot, and, I can tell already that the feature-rich options will make for super fun gameplay.The arenas are cool - so far, some bot designs seem faster than others, and I'm not sure which bot constructs will help me to crush the competition :). From my pov the AI can use a bit of tweaking to make it more competitive for some bots. That said, I can tell the developers have put alot of thought into both the lab and gameplay environments. From the posts, sounds like there are still updates to come....and definitely want to see those.			"

								I have never writen a review before, so It'l be awfull in the formating, but here we go...Though I'm aware that the game is an early access game, I have to say that it needs allot of work in many areas. The main part of the game I've been focusing on is creating my own bot, and I have to say it looks great,but after a short while of failed concepts, Ihave to say that it the layering system needs work, you can only choose between the two options of 3 layers and 5 layers, meaning that those who want to make a more simple shape are more limited on what they make, symetry is imposible as well because even when you have a symetrical complicated build, one side will  be curved outward and the other side will be curver inward. I also think that the workshop backgroud in the lab needs to be optional, and there is a need for the ability to reposition the camera as the one that is confined to the center,Heres an example or two of what Ive tried and what problems Ive come across.One of my favorite bots that I made in RAII was a bot which I had extended its chasis a bit and I had Attached motors to hydrolics so it could have a jumping and tilting feature. It was a very fun bot that I enjoyed using, so When I bought RAIII I tried to make it again, but I face several problems 1.Tthe display in the bot lab makes it somewhat imposible to make a  bot like that. 2. The pistons are way to glitched and will bend way too easily, when I did manage to make a testable  version the pistons barely could lift the bot, and the ones that did extend would bend, ultimately leading to the chasis being seamingly forced onto the ground. After failing to make a hydrolic jumping bot, I tried something more simple, I just made extensions so the chasis would  be kept in the air, like a monster truck type of build, Well the simple build was fine, but this time physics didnt agree, so instead of staying on its four evenly placed wheels, it flipped itself over and the chasis went upside down, wheels in the airIn conclusion to my complaint, I will say that the decision to purchase the game now is up to the viewer, You can either  play the game now, and help out in exposing the issues so they can be fixed, or you can wait untill the game is in a better state to buy it, I as an RAII fan will keep my purchase, and wait till the next update to see what they improve, then try to play it again.

								Most of the problems in this game have been caused by the fact you cant have normal components in contact with the ground and the fact the game picks up random signals from controllers which seemed to be the cause of every other glitch or bug i found.The paint shop works fine, granted its a bit confusing but once you get used to it and figure out how it works you end up having alot more flexability than in RA2 which i find better.The bot building its way more complicated but you can still build very effective and powerfull robots, once you take the time to learn how. I even built a micro robot which won an entire tournament effortlessly. And my ripsaw robot from RA2(Which i needed mods to be able to build) i managed to build in this with nothing but the tools provided and still manages to defeat all opponents in less than 20 seconds. My only problem with this game is that you do need to build robots to have nothing but wheel compoments in contact with the ground also the normal motors in the game are extremely slow in comparison to RA2, but thats fine because this games still in development. Developers want your feedback on what YOU want in this game you mightaswell give them the chance to give you the game you always dreamed of. Sure its not right now but im sure it will be if you give it a chance, i know i will be doing everything i can to help the developers make this game what it should be and i hope plenty others will too.

The host always wins.You can move before the game starts when in online play.Servos and burst motors stay in the air when moving the start/finish and therefore cannot be judged easily.Parts can go through the robot during gameplay. (I was able to break the burst motor basically)You can't make a two wheel robot properly.The chassis can be distorted to be put through itself.""Havok"" explosions have happened on multiplayer.Camera constantly moves down in the bot editor at times.Camera angles have to be changed via mouse.The skinning system is terrible and needs to be reworked.Train runs robots over, does no damage.

												I'm just going to be blunt. This game is overly complicated, buggy, and not really fun to play. The first time I played RA2, I fell in love with it. The building was simple and fun, the arenas were unique, and finally, it was just appealing to all ages. This game however, is faulty due to a number of reasons. One, it could be simpler to build a bot. Two, it is glitchy on average PC's like mine. But RA2 runs perfectly on my laptop. The final nail in the coffin is that they say the game is ""finished,"" but it still is laggy as ever. :( If I were you, I would buy RA2 instead of this sad excuse for a cash-grab			"

								Ive spent a bit of time playing round and fighting now and think i have seen enough to make a review. Firstly it does have the odd bug but then again thats why its advertised as an earlly access game. The bot creation can be a bit of a pain as the components start under the chassis and you have to adjust them and the rotation isnt as smooth as ra2. I encountered a glitch while testing the robot where it tends to fly or topple over but found adding weights to the robot stabilised it. Also if i could change something else it would be the ai controlled robots. In a career match they spend their time attacking already beat robots to rack up scores making it very hard to beat them.Anyway i gave this game a thumbs up because despite all the bad reviews and bugs its still easy to have fun. The creations have more possibilities and its easier to connect things for example the wheels. The graphics still dont seem as what promised but to be honest why are graphics so important? Its fun and passes time nicely. I cant wait to see the finished product.			"

												A re-make of Robot Arena 2 with less features, more bugs, and a wishy-washy development cycle.After their public gaffe over releasing the game as Early Access when promising a full release, I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  And in the last month, they have taken the game from being a nearly-unplayable mess into something akin to working as I would expect, albeit with still less features than RA2.And now?  They've decided it's done.  Full release!  ""We promise we'll keep working on it.""Nope, sorry.  I am sick of Early Access being used this way.The game isn't done. Don't waste your time or money.

												ok so robot arena 3 sure it has its bugs but what game doesn't have bugs? there will always be bugs in games you may complain i was complaining myself at first but things like building an effective flipper was a problem until i put 3 bidirectional motors in the same spot sure you may see it as putting a motor in a motor i see it as boosting the existing motors power output to the lifting arm.seriously though i will say this now for everyone else please give us a motor that is meant for being used as a flipper a chaos 2 standard of flipping motor as in it throws robots into the air. can we also have a crusher weapon of some kind so we can build razer and watch as our helpless victim can do nothing but watch as we crush his poor robot into a pancake. Another item this game needs is a high speed spin motor for spinning weapons that isn't gigantic like the z-tec motor as i recently built hypnodisc but had no choice but to have it sticking out the bottom mabye a ztek motor similar to the servo motor lg flat? one more item if you can spare the time an effective axe motor so that when your flipped you can self right efffectively with an axe since when you have a long axe you cannot self right unless you do the motor inside motor tactic.conclusion is this game is fun but it needs a lot of love and care to become a great gameand also please fix the multiplayer i want to fight people with my chaos 2 ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)			"

								Enjoying the game a lot so far. It is a bit cumbersome to build robots right now (though I feel there will be some touchups for that), the robots you can create are amazing, if you are patient. However, you can use the premade bots or just download some from Steam Workshop and jump into the very fun gameplay.			"

Tried to play 4 times and in every match, some bug came up and ruined the game.The modded version of Robot Arena 2 is waaaaayyyyy better, and even with the crashes and bugs that game contains, is still much better and much more complete than this game.No need for details, stay away from this huge bag of failures, put together in a frustrating, incomplete and horrible game.

												Whilst I love how good the chassis customisation is, and the Bot Lab is on the whole very impressive when it comes to user-friendliness, there are a few too many problems that I have already encountered:- The combat runs very slowly, even on minimum settings on my computer (which hasn't any trouble running games such as Skyrim), frequently dropping to 4 fps, which makes one of the main two game features unplayable.- It is even harder than in RA 2 to line up components with each other, and also the number of connection points seems limited, which is a pain when trying to build bots (what I spent most of my time doing)- The game crashed multiple times in the Bot Lab- The paint system doesn't really work on the 'sides' in the lab (a minor thing, I know)- All my robots have 37 wins and 6 defeats...I haven't tried the online multiplayer yet, as I don't think I would enjoy it due to the framerate, but I do have hopes for this and hope for the solving of the problems in the game. However, while I want to, I can't viably recommend this game to anyone at the moment.Please solve these problems - I really want to give this game a positive review!			"

								I can see why people are so mad.... after all these years you expect a company to really dedicate their time to making a good game... even after all those surveys that served for apparently nothing.. its not all that bad, but the physics are terrible as people mentioned.... RA2 is so much better as of now.... i wouldnt have minded paying $40 so the game could be so much better. THIS BETTER BE A JOKE. so much waiting for a game that looks like its been scrapped together in a couple of months. Problems: bots are hard to make, hard to control,  hard to fight with, and keep bouncing off the walls...... like wfttt..... i honestly expected more and the bots look absolutely stupid... to get the ones on the website you have to spend so much time.... if you really loved battlebots, robot wars, etc and ra2, this is far from it... it is a good idea and can be fixed, but yisus there are so many complications. and the graphics look kiddy, ra2 had more serious graphics and how long ago was it made???

								I want to write a good review because this game is fun. It's EARLY ACCESS! All those negative reviews after half an hour of gameplay shouldn't exist. It's not the prettiest game, the soundtrack is rough, but there are good things too!What to expect.1. Building is fun, the chassis doesn't always appear as smooth as it should, seems to not be mirrored when you build a bot with sloping sides. 2. Lots of components. You can pretty much build whatever you want. You'll see some CRAZY designs in the arenas. This is the reason we all play this game anyway.3. The AI aren't horrible. It's early access so I played one game where the bots just flipped themselves on the weird map and timed out but in a simple map they seem to fight decently. In a tournament you'll face such variety that one type of bot won't win everything with ease.4. Painting the bots needs a lot of work. Textures are all messed up. Overall I recommend this game. You'll have fun if you can get past it being a little buggy. The worst thing I've experienced was getting thrown accross the arena when an opponent's weapon moved back to it's starting position and I was in the way.			"

								TL;DR -Not great, but buy it anyway, and hopefully the devs will get the budget they need to make Robot Arena 4 the way this game should have been made in the first place.---So, the devs only started showing progress on the game about 5 months ago. That is not nearly enough time to put together a solid game of any kind. This game reflects that lack of time and budget they were given.The improvements to the bot lab are awesome. There is so much more freedom in how a robot can be built now. But that is hampered by the lack of any snap points for component placement or rotation. It's impossible to get any component pointed exactly the same way as any other component, or at the same height. Just adding some snap points would make the bot lab nearly perfect.Unfortunately from there, things get bad. Combat is much more like Robot Arena 1 than anything: slow boxes covered in components driving straight at each other. Even though you can flip other robots over, no matter how you build your chassis shape you cannot simply drive under other robots. You mearly bump into them until some physics instability allows you to accidentally end up underneith. Collisions are super simple. Most of the time chassis and components wont be anywhere near each other when their hit boxes collide. No matter how a match is lost, it classifies every losing robot as ""immobilized"". Sometimes already counted out robots will get counted out a second time. I can barely hear the ""announcer"" despite volumes being turned up all the way.The menus for some reason are designed as if I'm using an Xbox controller when I only have keyboard and mouse hooked up. It was quite confusing when it said ""Press (A) to continue"". Some of the menus apparently scroll, although there are no indications of this except for some images being slightly cut off. Click and drag is the way to scroll these menus for some reason.Textures look ok, and polygon counts are high, so no real complaints on the graphics side of things. There are more parts available than in stock Robot Arena 2, so that is an improvement. Background music is uninspiring stock instrumental stuff.If I had to play this on a tablet or something, it would be a mediocre 5/10, but being released through Steam for PC users, this game is currently a 3/10. It should be way better, but for some reason the studio decided to rush it out in only 5-8 months to test the market. Hopefully they both decide to make a Robot Arena 4, and go all out in making it the most realistic simulation of robot combat ever made like we want instead of the arcadey little toy they gave us.

								I wrote a longer review, but looks like the Steam store going down sent it into oblivion.Basically, this game is nowhere near as complete as the devs are making it sounds - it is NOT just missing 4P multiplayer, it's buggy and not user-friendly.The bot lab is downright cryptic without instructions - I'm not even sure what parts are bugged and which are just unclear at this point. Also, partial controller support? I wouldn't even say that - some menus let me press A to continue. That's about it. Yay. I know it's Early Access, but if you're claiming it's essentially complete that excuse doesn't really hold up. I want to like this game. Please fix it and let me like it.My fumbling attempts at trying to make this game work:

												Ok, played it a bit now, feel I can make a comment. Over all, I think this will be a great game, but sadly, it just wasn't ready for release. As is becoming the norm for Steam games, the devs released it with a ton of bugs and glitches and while it IS playable, you have to be very careful. The first and biggest problem is career mode. If you use one of the pre-made bots, it works great, but who really bought this game for that, right? There are certain requirements for each tournament that a custom built bot must meet, and if you don't meet them and try to enter the tournament anyway, it locks your bot and the tournament and you can't access either, you can't even customize your bot anymore, so that bot you just spent the last hour making is worthless.A lot of people say that the equipment isn't good enough, and I can understand that, I haven't seen a ""fast"" bot yet, it seems like the motors just aren't powerfull enough. Over all it will be a great game once the glitches are done, but so far it's just not ready yet.			"

												this game just not finished yet, i loved RA2 but this has been rushed out and not ready.1. playing career and press go nothing happons,2. when building a robot you click to test it crashs everything falls out and then your stuck and have to force close game as there nothing more you can do.3. playing the games fun until you hit a random mesh problem and your sent flying for no reason and lose (every time)4. vision angles and everything are just so wrong, first person good but cant really play, 3ed person and this tings moving around and not following you so it is imposabble to drive or play. in it currect state it should not be on market, it just as bad as the batman: AK PC rendering unplayable and no funextream disapointment as i loved RA2			"

												Just buy it. Yeah it's not at the greatest and it was rushed into the market for the Steam Summer Sale. But you know what? Every cheap game becomes bloody expensive after updates take place. Remember KPS? It sucked at first. Now it's one of my all time favorites.Get it now and let the boys do their work. It's still somewhat playable, but imagine it's state if they're still working on it a year from now. All the bugs ironed out, better UI, everything will just be improved.That being said, please bring back the Control programming from RA2. That was flawless and worked as it should in real life.Babysteps. Just give it time.			"

								I'm writing this as the game is one hour old, and people are already condemning it because it isn't the best game in the whole world. I enjoy this game a lot and do reccomend you buy it. its not perfect but what game launches and is just the best thing ever? It will continue to be updated and get better with each update. Buy the game, Be patient, Im sure within a week the big annoyances will be dealt with, and things are gonna change.tl;dr: Ignore everyone else, Its a fantastic game.			"

												It's Buggy, the physics freak out fairly consistently, and the community seems to be fully against the developers at this time; So why do I recommend this game?...Because, despite what people will tell you, this game is an improvement on Robot Arena 2: Most people praise it; And it is a fantastic game... With the right Mods... The building was inaccurate, the physics as a whole were worse than RA3, only more stable and not liable to throw you into the ceiling, the components were limited and unvaried; But this could all be solved with Mods.This is a very solid foundation for the game that it should be: And I find it very fun. It is a sandbox, and though parts are broken; The sand is still here. Some of it may be mud painted tan; Some of it may be gravel; But you can still have a ton of fun in this game.Bugs and glitches always turn people away from games like this, and though this game does have game breaking glitches that occur rather frequently under certain circumstances (Spinner weapons and wedges are generally overpowered or broken; Never as they should be. Either you or your opponent will be flung into the ceiling on contact.) But RA2 wasn't without it's glitches, either. They may not have been as game-breaking, but they were still pretty annoying, and above all, repeatable and constant.I personally don't see what others have a problem with. Yes, there are bugs, But yes, the game is still playable. No, the game isn't in Early Access anymore, and you jump to the conclusion that the game is finished?... Abandoned?... If anything, the main reason this game appears abandoned is because the poisonous community behind it! Perhaps if you weren't screaming at the developers, telling them to go kill themselves, maybe they wouldn't have made it appear as though they had listenedâ¦I for one stand behind this game entirely. It isn't perfect; But what is? It's a fun game, and worth the price if you can grab it on sale. I am fine with paying full price, seeing as I WILL be playing it fairly frequently.			"

												First of all, I dont know if its because an update came out, THIS GAME WORKS FINE!! THERE ARE NO BUGS! I have not encountered any so far. I'm so glad this game is out. I miss the original. This game lives up to the original for sure. Its fun, the graphics are not bad, and it works fine. Great buy!Cheers!!EDIT: Found design flaw (technically not a bug)  that lets you take a robot into a event but doesnt start the event because the bot is too heavy. They dont tell you that (had to go to the forums). And to top it off it locks the robot down so you cant edit or use it. AND!!! you can't quit the event. So its basically STUCK! Please fix this!!

												Terrible gameplay. Control of your robot is horrible and the game physics are awful beyond belief. The U.I. is bad in the create a robot section and the ''campain'' is buggy and super simplistic. They should never have released this as a finished game. Big heavy metal robots gets flipped up to the ceiling like they are empty cardbord boxes buy other robots randomly when no one even has a flip weapon. I loved the Robot Wars game on PS2 as a kid. This aint half as good, not even close.			"

								the UI for designing the robot is really bad, people play this game not because they want to design something with CAD tools! They want to get it done and play right away. The android version was even bettern than this.if you do wanna show off with this design tool, make it good. some time the object starts to rotate when i click my mouse on it and it doesn't go off, the esc button does not work at all. this is torture.also the control functions are really weired, lots of options without explanation. what's digital and analogue? what's the difference between turn on and spin cw (clockwise) for the motor? the optimization is bad when actually playing, makes me dizzy and want to vomit.you should have weighting for each component and the drive load for each motor.This is not even remotely done guys. going to get a refund.

												Once again, I am editting my review. This time I anticipate that it will stay negative.This game was such a massive disappointment. So little came out of a game that had so much potential. It appears as if the developers have completely abandoned it, even though three months they tried to give us hope that an update was coming.This game is riddled with bugs, the gameplay is messed up and the physics are absolutely atrocious. This was not just a massive step backwards, this was a massive leap backwards. You are better off downloading RA2 for free than wasting your money on a bad sequel.I kept up hope that this game would eventually become the sequel to RA2 that we all wanted, but, all hope I had is lost. I really, really hope that this game gets revived sometime next year, but I highly doubt that it will happen.			"

												UPDATE: Devs appear to have abandoned this game. Do not buy.Original Review (When it was recommended):Reading the reviews for this, i was a little worried.But after playing for a little over half an hour, the game isnt nearly as bad as i've heard. The game may have some bugs, like when i end a match, the camera keeps moving up in the bot editor. But other than that, the game is great. The game has tons of potential, and the dev team seems like they're gonna continue to work on the game. I can recommend it.			"

												This game feels like it's still in alpha: Tons of bugs, in bot construction, the physics engine, and even navigating the menus / starting matches. The core gameplay is there (building + fighting bots) but there's not much of a game around it. Even the core experience feels lacking, with questionable AI and an occasionally-misbehaving camera.I wish the developers released the game in Early Access if they plan on fleshing this out into a more complete experience. In its current state, the game is not worth your time or money. You're better off playing Robot Arena II			"

Early Access Review
								This game is rather unfinished but shows promise, however there are a few MAJOR problems that prevent it from living up to it's potential, which should hopefully be fixed once out of Early Access.WHAT IS GOOD:- The new chassis mechanic is fantastic.- The ability to place components inside of each other makes for excellent IRL building- The game is a LOT more stable than RA2- The combat system is very fun- The Arenas are really creative, and I especially like the new disco arena.- Developers are actually taking feedback on what is wrong with the game too, which sadly     doesn't always happen with indie titlesWHAT IS NEEDED:- The UI is a complete disaster... Although that can be easily fixed by modding when mod  support comes around.- Being able to fire your weapons in the bot lab.- Burst motors moving as you change their start and end points is going to be a good idea, and  would help when trying to build flippers.- Snap Rotation, and component raising.- Rotation speed up- Motor speeds need to be tweaked, as they are too slow.As is I cannot decide weather or not to reccomend this title unless you are willing to take a risk. Yes it is broken but It's thumbs up because it is still fun.Grade: No grade for Early Access titles			"
