												The Game That Could Have Been King...Back in 2009, Valve put a small mod on the front page of their Steam store, leading to a rush of new players, myself included, all jumping aboard the Smashball train. And what we found? Something really incredibly fun. But if the game was that good, why does nobody still play it? Well, I'll get to that in a bit, but here's a summary of what the game was actually about.Two teams, divided up into four classes (Forward, Half-back, Full-back and Goalkeeper), armed with guns and grappling hooks, running and jumping - but mostly swinging - to get the ball into the opposition's net. Throwing the ball in would get three points, while carrying it in for a run would garner seven points. With each match consisting of six three-minute periods, matches were fairly brief, but full of action.Each class had their own weapons and stats; forwards were fast but squishy with fairly weak weapons, full-backs slow but strong with weapons designed to slow the enemy down enough to get in close for bruising body tackles. Half-backs balanced between the previous two classes - stronger but slower than forwards, weaker but faster than full-backs, with middling weapons. Goalkeepers though were the meanest of the lot; stronger than all the other classes and with the best weapons, they were limited to only one a team, and were often actually controlled by bots (the only class that had bots actually!) since their job was to hang back and defend the goal and most people didn't want to do that in scrimmages.All classes also had a slowly recharging power bar, with which they could do one of two things; hit Shift to start a turbo charge which would propel them at high speed for a short distance and with the weightier classes, also doing a lot of damage if connecting with an opponent and maybe causing them to drop the ball, but by pressing F, they would also use the pickup skill. How this worked was it emitted an invisible sphere around the player, differently sized for each class, which if the ball was loose within it, would cause the ball to zip straight into their hands. This meant that players could not only scrabble for balls that had fallen to the ground (and sometimes those moshpits in the corner were grotesquely brutal), but they could also intercept their opponents passes, snagging the ball in midair as it was homing in on it's targetted receiver.But what the game was really about? Speed. This being a Source engine game, with its own unique take on physics, led to some interesting little tactics that came prominently to the fore in Smashball. Firstly, that bunnyhopping was automatic if you held down the space bar. This meant that on a straight line, you could always maintain your momentum, however fast you were going. With a little bit of practice, grappling through doorways allowed players to build up tremendous speed, allowing them to soar across the maps. And with airstrafing, an interesting little quirk in the physics more commonly seen on Counter Strike's surf maps, it meant that people could also turn corners while maintaining the furious pace they'd built up. This led to an incredibly high-octane experience of breathtaking movement mixed with complete and utter physical carnage.There were problems though. Goalkeepers' weapons were incredibly powerful, but terrible at range, enough so that a forward could pick them off easily, allowing for easy goals or runs. Forwards' pickup spheres were so large that they actually made better goalkeepers than, well, the goalkeepers, so they would often camp in front of their own goal once the opposing side had the ball, snatching any shots that came their way. And if you couldn't throw the ball in, well, you couldn't run it in either because the goal line would get flooded by players physically blocking you as well. Oh, and the tutorial? Completely and utterly useless in preparing a player for the actual game.The biggest problem though was the game's main feature: speed. Or more specifically, the one skill that was utterly required to become good at the game, involving maintaining your high speed and enabling you to avoid enemies as you raced for the opposition's goal. Airstrafing. It wasn't that it was an inherently bad thing; I'd in fact say the opposite, it was brilliant. It's just that it was actually very, very, VERY hard to learn, and basically involved hours and hours of practice, usually by yourself, to hone a skill for a free mod.When the game's population exploded due to the Steam publicity, lots of people were utterly new to the game and since there were so many starting out at the same level, the game was genuinely fun. But as others got better and better, including picking up airstrafing, a clear divide began to become obvious in the playerbase. Those who could airstrafe were incredibly fast and hard to stop from doing whatever the hell they wanted, while those who couldn't airstrafe (and I was pretty bad at it myself) simply couldn't keep up. Since the airstafing skill is so hard to pickup, it led to a lot of people leaving the game, the enjoyment of the frenetic scrambles having faded away as they were constantly outclassed by the same people again and again.The developers noticed this, and promptly went into a panic. Understandably so, their beloved mod was dying right before their eyes, and they knew they had to do something to stop that from happening. And so they nerfed the top speed available, made players stick to the ground more, made weapons do more damage and made the maps smaller.In the end, Smashball was a game that was all about speed, and when that was taken away, nobody wanted to play it anymore, and it died a sad and ignomious death. If anything, the game was a victim of its own success; the Steam explosion really brought its weaknesses to the fore, and the developers rushed to create a fix for it that ended up alienating their core playerbase insteadWould the new Source engine fix airstrafing, making the game a more even playing field were it to be remade? I know I'd sure like to find out; over five years have passed since I last played Smashball regularly, and I still miss it.			"

												Smashball is an amazing game, it's a mixture of TF2 & rugby(football),it's a team-based game that relies on teamwork between each team, for starters you have to know all the basics from the tutorial. the only main problem is that, there are no one playing this game and servers are empty.. kinda sad, because it really has the big potential to be a competitive game.

												This Game/Mod could have so much potential only to be wasted by a dead community.When I first played this game or heard about it, I liked its concept however once I clicked on 'Find Servers' there's barely any servers, in fact only two of them are available but empty.If you looking for a multiplayer game that has at least 24 players, you won't be able to find it here. But just have a go at this game, who knows it could come back alive as a popular game but for now, not worth your time unless you planning to have a LAN party.			"

If you have the friends I would recommend trying the game but seeing as there are no players or servers up anymore it really is your only hope to have a few friends who also want to play it.			"

												Smashball is a fast-paced, ultraviolent first-person sports shooter. Two teams use superhuman maneuvers, a real-physics grappling hook and high-powered weaponry to try to get a single ball into the goal of their opponents. Smash Ball is a fun, free mod which differs from your usual gaming habits. There is the potential to have some cool moments of teamwork, but  mostly it goes under in the frenetic action that is constantly going on. There is still plenty to do on the four maps that are currently available. If you are looking for a new use for the Source Engine that also provides plenty of fast fun, you can give Smashball a chance. Unfortunately the mod is dead, nowadays there are only empty servers.Sounds 6/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Another attempt at competitive gaming that fizzled during infancy.The mod offers a well made tutorial for beginners that cover most of the game basics but gameplay his not easily approachable by newcomers and hindered by a lack of flexibility and over-balancing.			"

												Smashball is a very good game imitating the game mode ""Bombing Run"" from unreal tournament 2003, and its actually quite fun!the game consists of a ball (in the middle of the playfield),2 goalies,and the players that are playing this game ( not very many players)you have at least 2 weapons, a grappling hook to make tricks (important!), and a turbo (important!)The turbo gives you a little bit more speed,while the grappling hook helps you to reach areas and throwing the ball into the goal!using them in kombination ( IMPORTANT!!! ) is very good to outsmart goalies (maybe... *sniff* maybe...)if youre playing with at least one other guy in the team (auto balance is in this game!)you can also pass the ball to him to also outsmart the goalie!may i make a Suggestion?Play this game, man!

												This is a great game, very complex and tactical.Every role got his part and teamplay is required if you want to make a good score.The best part of this game is that it is about scoring goals and knocking out or killing enemies is secondary.Although grafics are bad, the gameplay is unique.The problem in this game is, that it is death...Like in empiresmod you can barely find players or servers.TLDNR: It is dead.

												This game was probably pretty fun - when people actually played it. As of now, the servers have completely died out.
