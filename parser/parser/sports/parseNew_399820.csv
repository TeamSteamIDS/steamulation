								This is the product of what would happen if the fast-paced and thunderbolt world of Super Mario Strikers met the charming and intense world of Sensible Soccer. Sprinkle some unforgettable scenes from Shaolin Soccer and you have Kopanito All-Stars Soccer. Impressions+ I have never had so much fun slide tackling in to opponents. Traditional grassroot rules do not apply, so get out there and break those legs!+ Gameplay is solid and fully responsive between keyboard and gamepad. There is a learning curve involved, but once you discover the importance of team work, dribbling and tackling, everything feels a lot friendlier. + Visually a very charming game. The cartoony art direction is certainly a good call and works well. Player animations are solid. Goal celebrations are... ahem... animated. + Not a lot to offer in terms of sound effects and soundtrack, but the current offering delivers to a satisfactory standard.+ A large assortment of competitions to unlock and play through including custom tournaments, practice and friendly matches.+ Powers can be huge game changers and injects new life to the sport. There are four powers in total with individual strengths and weaknesses.+ Support for up to four additional local players. Grab your friend(s) and charge through various tournaments as a team.+ Full keyboard + mouse and gamepad support. Keys can be configured to your heart’s content.+ The greater the goal difference, the more resilient and alert the AI becomes to your tackles and dribbles. Something I have not seen before, but it's a mechanic which works extremely well in an attempt to avoid further catastrophes. + Leaderboard and fame points work really well side by side. Adds a whole different layer of depth for players to continue playing and reach the Platinum League.+ 225 achievements and in-game trophies. That’s 225 individual pieces of effort and excruciating dedication to unlock.+ Match challenges offer objectives for players in search of small modifiers (ie. avoid using powers, score three goals in 30 seconds, and so on). You gain fame points in return for your efforts.+ Friendly user interface with all the standard options you would expect from a PC title.+ Online multiplayer is planned for release with the final version of the game.Early access consideration and dev feedback- A friendly warning: The AI will torture you during your first few sessions/hours until you figure out how everything works. You may even grow suspicious of cheating AI. I most certainly did. The important thing is to try and play as much as you can to get to grips with the gameplay.- Slight overkill with AI catch up speed compared to player catch up. I don't feel like the sprint button does anything when chasing the AI.- The need for more power ups or other methods of scoring (ie. volley or header) is great.- There is an audio balancing issue. Almost all audio during play comes through the right speaker/headphone. I have tried using two perfectly functional headsets and a speaker to cancel any malfunctions on my end.- Only international teams are playable. It would be great to be able to play in a league filled with fictional teams/players, just to shrug off the feeling of international play. Pro Evolution Soccer has done this for many years with great success (ie. North London: Arsenal; Hampshire Red: Southampton; Merseyside Blue: Everton). - It would be an even greater feature to allow players the freedom to create their own teams, team names, players and kits from pre-made designs, then to incorporate this team to a randomly generated and fictional league.

ReviewIf you don't want to worry about team formation, tatics and you want to play quick and short soccer games, this game was made for you.Kopanito is a soccer game on Early Access that already has a lot of content:-16 tournaments and cups to play, but you can also create your own tournament.-100+ teams from all over the world.-4 AI difficulty levels-Super-moves-Achievements-Leaderboards-Controller supportIt's an extremely simple soccer game. You pick your team (5 players + 1 goal keeper) and you can play a friendly match or try to win a tournament or cup.There are no fouls, no referees, no team formation, no tatics, no stamina.The game has a smooth gameplay, you can tackle as much as you want, but that doesn't mean you're going to easily steal the ball.When you press and hold the kick button the game slows down and you can change the ball direction, making the goal keeper's life difficult.The super-moves are a nice addition to the game: you can freeze your opponent, you can use a magnet to pull the ball, you can teleport to another region of the field, you can perform a super shot or use a windmaker to blow the ball away from your goal.You can play locally with your friends: up to 5 local players, using gamepads and a keyboard.In the beginning you can play just one tournament. You need to win it on the Beginner level to unlock another tournament and so on.Even though the game has 100+ teams you can pick just a few in the beginning and you need to unlock the other teams.Rating:9/10Pros: Cartoony and cute graphics.Simple gameplay.Nice tutorial.Achievements.Short games.Fast pace.You can generate GIF from your goals. Cons:The team supporters are too quiet.The AI difficult needs balancing. From the Beginner to the Amateur level it gets way too difficult. The devs are already working on it.The ball rebounds needs improvement. It's hard control your player.Lack of multiplayer online, but the devs are already working on it.For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

Early Access Review
								This is the closest I've come to finding something like Nintendo World Cup/Nekketsu High School Dodgeball Club: Soccer on the PC.I generally don't buy early access games, but this game was on sale for $3.59 and is scheduled to exit early access in July 2016.  Single player and local multiplayer with controller and keyboard support are implemented, and generally work well.  XBox 360/XBox One controllers should work out of the box.  Other controllers should work through X360CE, and oddly enough, my DualShock 2 through a USB adaptor worked, though I did have to remap the buttons.The downside is that there is no network multiplayer support - only local multiplayer support.  The developers have stated that they're working on adding the support before the game exits early access, and I hope that they do because this game is seriously fun.I wouldn't suggest buying this game for full price right now, at least until it exits early access.  Pick it up while it's on sale and have a grand old time re-living working through Nintendo World Cup at the age of 8!			"

												This game is cheap and fun! Kudos to the devs who had such a brilliant idea!Pros:-No demanding system requirements-Ability to play short/long games offline(local player with friends) or online as well and many tournaments and cups-Intuitive and not hard to learn (but it is tricky to master all the game mechanics, which in my opinion is good)-No referee/penalties/stamina/injuries/team tactics etc.-Less bugs than FIFA-Cheaper than FIFA-Better than FIFACons:- Large room for improvement in the online multiplayerThis game should be well known in all the world because I got tired of FIFA and PES that every year change some players in the teams, polish a bit the mechanics and then sell the game for the same price of the previous year.Devs u deserve a CAKE!10/10			"

								Kopanito All-Stars Soccer is a funny skill based football game. Game mostly based on you fast reaction.In the game you will find in one team of 6 players, your main goal , is should be obviously, because this is a football game, so you should win a match. Beside this you will get for every match different goals like do clean sheet etc. Here to play you can pick a various national teams, but at the start only a few available, other ones you will unlock them when you win a different tournaments in different difficulty level. The basic is a football, but here you will not find too many rules, only some basic like a corned kick, throw in. Also here you will found some special skills what you get randomly after some time and can use it, for example super shoot or teleport.Here you will find besides a single player tournaments a local multiplayer mode and in future also an online multiplayer.The game controls are very simple , you can easily learn a basic element, they are well presented in a text with picture, also you can do practice.The game style well fit to the game style, all characters looks a bit funny, but nice. There you will not find to much sounds, but they are good.So my verdict:+enjoyable gameplay+some unusual in football games+nice style+leaderboards +local multiplayer up to 5 player+different difficulty levels+steam cards and achievements-at the moment no online multiplayer (will come in future)-in some moments can be frustratingWell i think this game you should try out even if you are not a football fan. This game looks fun and can bring enjoyable moments for all age players. Gameplay is based in you skills and fast reaction, but after some practice this shouldn´t be a problem for you. So if you want to get some fresh experiences and try out your skills, this game is for you. Game still in early access, but the announced future updates should do this game even more funny and enjoyable. "

												Really good game, and they're not lying about it being skill based. See this gif of a goal I scored, partly by accident - its what made me realise this game allows for some serious skill to be developed:http://puu.sh/t13Ox/d066abd8b3.gifI've been trying to replicate that goal ever since. You can further develop skills as well - even the AI will tend to pass the ball into space and then sprint onto it, but I kept finding that when I tried doing that against professional (i.e. hard) AI they could still slide into where you put the ball, so I started turning around quickly soon after picking up the ball again after sprinting onto it and it often means I evade their slide tackle attempt and I'm gifted a glorious chance on goal. Speaking of which, scoring is an absolute delight in this game, as it should be in any football game, especially when you get just the right amount of curve on the ball that it beats the keeper. I wish airshots were a bit more complex - its nothing more than just holding down the shoot button, but then again it does require some skill with lobbing and corners before you get a prime opportunity to airshot the ball into the net.Gameplay is VERY fast on higher difficulty, the ball will travel a lot an utmost attention is required to keep up. The game certainly provides ample challenge for players and, as mentioned, the AI will start to show off their skill too (which I didn't expect, the hard AI in Rocket League is terrible, so I had lower standards for the AI in Kopanito).My only issues are: no custom-made teams, the online play doesn't seem to be working (although you can still play against people on your Steam friends list, which is enough for me), there's no in-game chat, the keyboard sometimes adds itself as another player, and your friend can't personally choose their own team. Also I wish the crowds were animated (it's like playing at the Emirates Stadium) and that there were people on the subs bench - minor details that would add some nice touches. Being able to choose what colour Player 1, 2, 3, etc, is would also be really helpful - I played locally with a friend on the same team and I had pink and he had red so it was a bit confusing.Overall I definitely recommend this game, I was already happy with my purchase only a few hours in.

Early Access Review
What is Kopanito All-Stars Soccer?Kopanito All-Stars Soccer is a fast-paced action soccer game that has been in development by Merixgame since September 2015. Throughout this development timeline they have continued to make regular updates to the game. They have also, at all times, communicated openly and quickly with their fans.In fact, because of their consistent development and their great communication with their community it wouldn’t be out of place to consider them an Early Access role model. I honestly believe that indie developers would do well to look at the way in which they have gone through the early access pipeline.The developers have openly claimed to have been inspired by some of the greatest soccer games in gaming history. These include Kick Off, Sensible Soccer and Nintendo World Cup. These games provided gamers around the world thousands of hours of entertainment. I believe that Kopanito fits that niche rather nicely.Easy to Learn but Depth for StrategyThe gameplay has been designed so that it is easy for gamers to jump into and play immediately. However, it is frenetic and challenging enough that it is a beast to master. There have been numerous times throughout the time that I have cursed at missed opportunities and even more when I’ve learned a new tactic or strategy that was previously unknown to me.This is perhaps the biggest surprise to me. The game appears to be very simple. Players don’t need to worry about the general rules of soccer. There are no offside calls, fouls, etc. Yet the depth of the game to include strategy is deeper than it first appears to be.TournamentsThere are 16 different tournaments to play in. Some of them need to be unlocked by winning certain tournaments in various game modes. A nice feature of tournaments is that each game of the tournament can be played with up to five players and it isn’t dependent upon the number of players you began the tournament with. Therefore, if you have friends or family members come to your house and you’d like them to join you they can easily do so.There is also an option for players to create their own tournament.TeamsThere are a whopping 114 teams within the game. These represent countries from around the world.I do have two minor sticking points with these teams. Firstly, I don’t believe that players have unique modifiers or attributes. If they are there then they are not necessarily clear. Each team plays the same as any other. While this ensures a level playing field with games determined purely by skill it doesn’t provide any point of difference on any of the teams. You’re not going to pick a South American team (e.g. Brazil) and expect to be able to play with more floor and pizazz.Secondly, do not expect to be able to play as your favourite countries right away. The majority of the major countries are locked. They unlock when you complete a set task. For example, to unlock my native Australia I need to win the Oceania Cup on professional difficulty. To unlock England, you need to win the World League on Professional difficulty. This is intended to be motivating but when every team seemingly plays the same as any other the primary motivation may not be as high as anticipated.Super-movesA significant part of the game’s enjoyment comes in the is the ‘super-moves’ feature. There are a number of super-moves. You gain one super-move for filling up the super bar. To fill up the super bar players have to do successful things in the field of play (e.g. a successful tackle, pass, score, etc.). These Super-moves can often prove to be match winners on both ends of the field.I was playing a tournament game as Tonga against New Zealand and was 2-1 up late in the game. I unlocked a super-move which turned out to be a wind move. New Zealand had the ball late in the game and my last defender had unsuccessfully slide tackled the Kiwi striker. I quickly used my super-move just as he was about to slot the game-tying goal. The ball proceeded to be blown back out of the penalty area. New Zealand pounced on the ball and passed it back to the striker who again was met with the wind. My super-move saved the game for me. Conversely, in the final against Australia I was tied late in the game when I unleashed my power shot super-move. The keeper deflected it but it dazed him which opened up the goal completely for my rebounding striker who slotted in the game winner.Is it Steamified?My word is this game Steamified. There are over 200 achievements. They unlock frequently enough that you’ll want to continue playing more and more. Yet there are enough achievements that are a challenge to unlock that perfect game does not feel cheap. It will take even the most skilled players many hours of play before they unlock every achievement.The game also has a set of six trading cards. The developers are working on implementing Steam Workshop features into the game. Players can already create stadiums, balls and teams for modding. This should proveVerdictIf you’re looking for a casual soccer experience that provides entertainment and challenge, then look no further than Kopanito All-Star Soccer. It’s as enjoyable as any casual soccer game has been in years.For similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

								This game is pretty casual and very fun, but can also become a hardcore game if you want it too.  Overall I recommened this game to anyone that has that ""sports itch"" at the moment and is looking for something to play.  I also recommend to anyone that likes sports games in general too.From a singleplayer point of view:I was never into sports games or watched any sports in real life, but I do enjoy playing the games from time to time.  I am one of those that got the ""sports itch"", I looked around and saw this game.  The graphics are very welcoming and fun which pushed me to buy this.  When I started playing, I was amazed at how fun the game actually was, the overall mechanics are simple, but there is an underlying depth to it which makes it hard to master.Anyone can pick up this game and play it right away with no problem.  The fun factor was instant, I just wanted to play more and more.What also appealed to me is that, there aren't any rules, except when kicking the ball out of bounds, anything goes beyond that.  You can slide tackle all you want and watch your opponent eat grass all day if you want too.  This to me is awesome because sports games with all these rules turn me off, I just want to play for fun, if I want rules then I'll play the other fifa games or w/e.Overall I would recommend purchasing this game, especially if you play with friends, I can see lots of enjoyment coming out of it.  If not then definitely keep an eye out.			"

								When I was a child, me and my cousin would love to play Nekketsu Soccer (Goal3).Even now I have its emulated version and sometimes I'm playing it with the same joy.And I searched an alternative\better version of Nekketsu for a long long time. Years later I found ""Lego Soccermania"" wich was 3D and super fun to play. Today I found this gem and I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ happy.First you are starting with an easy practice mode, controls are so easy and consistant if you ever played fifa or pes at least once. And then jumping in a tournament with AI. Difficulties are selectable. And I have to say AI is really good. You have to start at Oceania Cup.. So you cant just pick the most powerful european teams. They are locked. You have to win the tournament and unlock them. And this is really nice to me. We got stadiums, footballs, teams to unlock. We got tons of achivements. I really liked it. Online matchmaking is coming. This will be great.Really nice and cute graphics.Mayyybe sounds would be better.. But its enough for now.So.. I really liked this game. It remainded me the good old times that I was spent with my cousin.. I will never quit playing Nekketsu but I think I'll be busy with this game for a while.Muzlu Approves®  "

												The game itself is great and a lot of fun.  I think this is one of the most frustrating menu systems I've seen.  I wish you could permanently disable certain controllers in the settings.  As it is, since I have a keyboard / mouse, gamepad, and X52 flight stick I need to go to the main menu and disable the flight stick and keyboard otherwise every match I play it will create 3 players for me.  No problem, disable it in the game lobby you say?  No, if you forget to manually disable a controller you join your match with multiple players, have to quit out, disable controllers again, get another invite.. etc...  It's you're playing with 4+ people watch all of them have to do this once or twice.Were you in the game and hit Shift+Tab for Steam overlay?  Woops, now your keyboard is active again and you have to quit out, go back to the main menu, disable the controller, and get reinvited to your game.If they can fix this it's a must buy.  If they don't I still recommend the game as it's fun and skill-based, similar to rocket league.			"

												I'm probably just gonna repeat what others have already said, but this game is a real gem, a fantastic tribute to the likes of Microprose Soccer (those ""banana"" shots!), Kick-Off and Sensible Soccer (not to mention some of the '90s side-scrolling football games at the arcades). Yeah, it's not FIFA or PES...but IMO it's actually better than both when it comes to the pure ""fun"" factor. Hopefully, it will attract more and more people to the online scene as well.

Game reviewed before online multiplayer is available.Some people may think that because a football game isn't ""serious"", it can be sloppy. These people are wrong, IMO. Games like Rocket League or Mario Strikers on Wii are perfect examples of well-oiled games of this genre. Kopanito fits within this category too. It looks a lot like World Cup on the NES for those who are young enough to have played it but with a serious update.PROS:- Good controls/dynamics- Lots of ways to approach this game. Many options to score goals- Surprisingly fair- Easy/fun to play but room for competitive games, I think (we'll see once the online multi is available)CONS:- It says ""soccer"" in the title. Guys: it's called football! (sarcasm) (or not!)- Could be tedious on the long run vs. computer. Guess online multi will solve the issue.Conclusion: funnier to play compared to ""realistic"" games like FIFA or PES. Worth the price tag but grab it while it's on sale a get 2-3 copies for your friends. Fun should ensue.			"

								To say the game isn't fun for an hour or two would be a lie. But at a price point of 10.99 (CDN) there just is zero meat on the bone to want to keep playing. It took about 4 hours to play all the tournements on the beginner level to unlock the other ones. Then you are to move up to the next difficulty to again, unlock the next tiers of tournements. In lies the rub, there is no variety in the games. Yes, it's soccer. But all it is as simply put is; slide tackle, run for 5 feet and then start spinning with the ball and hope the never missing AI might miss a tackle. Then use the sniper mode to aim for one of the corners..... Rinse repeat. That is the whole game. None of the teams have any 'differnce' other then the colours of their shirts/player faces. No team is better then the other and you can NEVER outrun a defender. If you have the ball you run at 75% speed any defenseman can run down forwards. It's just a little silly.If it's on sale, grab it for a few hours of something sports on Steam. Don't expect it to hold your attention for long once you are past the first few games and your doing the exact thing every game.			"

Adding tournament mode for online multiplayer would be excellent.			"

								Imagine a game where your team only consists of O. Khan, Pepe, J. Barton, Gattuso, R. Keane and Diego costa.And essentially just let them loose because this time there is no ref to sent them off.The game sounds simple enough, all you got to do is score and everything is legal.But its alot more challanging then it sounds. Well placed curlers, slide tackles to reach a pass that was a little off, and correctly timed interceptions is pretty much key in this game, aswell as obviously passing, crosses etc. There is pretty much no time to rest or think of a strategy since its extremely fast paced.Itll take quite some time befor unlocking every team/tournament, especially on harder difficulties.Oh and playing this game as a local co-op with friends is def. recommended. Especially local 2vs2 is alot of fun. You will also learn too hate them every time they use a special power.			"

								Fantastic little game. Best Indie football game on Steam. The clever slow mo shooting system and easy curved shot controls means you're spend plenty of time watching your amazing goal replays. The slide tackles are particularly satisfying, especially as there are no fouls. Revenge is openly encouraged. Considering this is still in early access, there's a good amount of content to enjoy. It's just a fun to play football arcade game. A hidden gem.			"

								Even though this game is in Early Access, there are really few mentionable flaws that could restrain someone from buying it in this phase of game development, like the fact that online mode is still in its early stage, or some AI flaws still persisting when it comes to picking up a passed ball.Anyway, the game is very fun and playable, with an easy start in the Beginner AI modes and becoming very challenging when climbing the skill ladder. The developers look closely to comments and involve and let participate the KAS community in selecting the next enhancements to where the game should be developed to.What I especially like about Kopanito is the simplicity of controls compared to other high class (AAA) football games like the FIFA (tm) series e.g.. In Kopanito, one does not need a long learning curve to become familiar with the controls and can start playing at an instant. Still one can do some really nice (trick-)shots, and especially playing local multiplayer gains a lot of Schadenfreude, e.g. when kicking the ball with an overhead kick into the opponent's goal (including their goalkeeper), or smashing the forward just before the shot with the goalie and a defender in synchronicity...Keeping away no-fun rules (like offsides, yellow and red cards) and plainly focusing on game flow, Kopanito reminds me on the goody old times when a friend of mine and I played Sensible Soccer on the Amiga for hours and hours (he won most of the time ;-) ). Taking into account the absolutely fair game price, I believe that no one will make a mistake in buying this game who likes casual sports games that suddenly evolve into a family affair... :-)I'd like to give two thumbs up to this game. Unfortunately, Steam does only allow for one :-)			"

												A must buy for those who grew up with all the great 90's arcade soccer games, like Nintendo World Cup, Sensible Soccer, FIFA '94, Seibu Cup Soccer, Hat Trick Hero, Super Sidekicks, Tecmo World Cup, Ultimate Soccer, etc.>> Active and communicative Devs, listen to the community, ask for feedback through polls or discussions, and even work during weekends, fixing small errors or respoding threads in the forum.>> Dozens of national teams, even those who never show up in a soccer game.>> All the teams, except for the appearance, have the same stats (actually, there are no stats), so there is no hegemony of the same 6 or 8 most powerful nations, because the game is pretty much skill-based.>> As the game is skill-based, the highest IA difficulties (Professional and Legendary) are pretty balanced already, making them more challenging than frustrating, as you can win or lose, depending mostly on your own performance.>> Air moves, precise shots (curve / swerve shots), manual passes, even the sliding tackles, are made with a skill-based gameplay in mind, cause all of them requires a fair, but not frustrating, amount of timing, reflexes and precision, making the game fun and rewarding.>> Super moves adds deepness to the gameplay by having the ability to ""turn the tables"" in a tight game. Also some of them somewhat ""counters"" other super moves, when used at the right time.Things to improve:>> Controls can be very frustrating sometimes, thanks to the fast skill-based gameplay, the lack of proper feedback for certain actions (like air moves explained below) and the reaction time of our players (sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow).>> The way air moves are executed is not precise enough and many times you find yourself tapping the shot button pointlessly and repeatedly in orden to make a headshot or bicycle kick, which several times is never executed.>> Random annoying FPS drops, mostly when you interact with the GKs or in the corners or goals (when you can see the stadium / crowd); is not so bad as in 2 or 3 patches ago, but is still an issue to resolve.>> Challenges difficulty is very unbalanced and many of them are pointless and / or boring.Things I'd like to see:>> Teams / players editor, support for community modding and perhaps the addition of some RPG elements, to give more personality to the different teams.>> MUSIC, we need an optional background music during matches. Kopanito relies partially on nostalgia, so Devs should expand and improve the soundtrack (the main theme is terrible) to make it sound like those classic soccer games from the '90s, something like this:

								Most fun I've had playing soccer in a game since the NES.   The aim system is fast and efficient.  Friendly fire is sort of hilarious.  I don't get a lot about it still, but I cannot wit to get some peeps over to play me!  I can't wait to see what else this game has to offer.  My only lame request, that impacts the game none whatsoever, is I wish I could design my jersey.  =P  Seriously well made Soccer sim that fun instead of technical.  The game plays as fast as the real thing.  Great Early Access entry.  Even if you don't enjoy soccer, this one might get your heart racing once you start playing.  A good game for beginners and long time players alike.  I've been waiting for years for something like this..			"

								Kopanito All-Stars Soccer:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~“What a superb pass from the midfielder to the winger - he beat the defender fair and square, he is going to score without a doubt! What a move, Ladies and Gentlemen. Exceptional talent displayed from this player but . . . Hold on, WHAT A CRASHIIIING TACKLE from the second defender, so hard that his boots are the only remains on the pitch! Did you see where he landed, guys?” I love commentating Kopanito All-Stars Soccer matches; we see great moves, great tackles and no dives! Plenty of boots here and there but definitely no dives.Kopanito All-Stars Soccer is a fast paced arcade-ish sports game. As per the intro, this sports game is absolutely frantic, to say the least! Well, there are no referees on the pitch and we do not care about this silly offside rule. All we have is two teams of six players each who go in to battle fiercely to win the match.  You will be able to use super moves when you fill the energy bar (I call it that), every successful pass, tackle, shot and goal will help you to increase your charge bar. Then you might get the super shot and score; you might get the magnet to pull the ball back to you (this is what Germany used in the Semi-final against Brazil in the latest World cup, for sure); you might teleport a player up field, or even get a massive ventilator behind the net so the ball can’t cross the line! JUST FUN!16 tournaments and leagues to play either solo or with friends on local multiplayer which supports up to five players (four on gamepads and one at the keyboard) and four levels of difficulty. I would recommend that you start playing on the beginner level for a while and familiarise yourself with the gameplay. As soon as you move up to the amateur, the difficulty increases dramatically. During each match, you will be given a challenge - if you manage to succeed you will receive points and in-game achievements. 114 national teams to choose from but a large number of them need to be unlocked. I really like the cartoonish graphics; the game is very well balanced and the controls very responsive. Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Really fun gameplay-	Great cartoon graphics-	100’s of national teams to play-	Great number of tournaments and leagues to play (including custom ones)-	Local multiplayer-	Trading cards-	Stacks of achievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~   -	The levels of difficulty increase rather steeplyIt is fast, fun, competitive and even frustrating at times. Kopanito All-Stars Soccer is a must-have!9/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												I really want to like this game, and, in a way I do. I paid 3 GBP for this and after spending less than an hour playing, I already have some strong opinions about how this game needs to be improved.Asthetically, everything holds up. The art style is consistent througout and sound effects are clean and punchy. The problem unfortunately comes from gameplay.My first and most prominent gripe is the dribbling system, or lack thereof. Slide tackling gets old pretty fast as you get pummled from every angle and with no penalty to the opposing team. It feels impossible to manouver anywhere in which an opposing player is standing due to the risk of getting tackled by a 10 yard slide. Getting rid of the ball ASAP seems to be the name of the game.In a previous match, a challenge encouraged me to tackle 10 players without sliding (blocking tackle). I managed to do so but immediately after completing the challenge, I went right back to using sliding as my sole means of performing a tackle. There's little argument to justify using a blocking tackle.Power ups are pretty cool but theres only 6 and they seem pretty unbalanced. A rather infuriating one is an electrocuting drone which lasts much longer than any other power up.The challenges add some needed variety to the game although they can go from being mildly challenging to feeling down right impossible. You can collect stars and coins but the menu options and guide don't provide any direction as to what they mean or if they can even be used.I've complained enough so let me reassure you that there are some good points to this game. Shooting feels robust and the abilitiy to switch between manual and auto passing on the fly is great. There's plenty to like about this game but the minor annoyances mentioned above are likely to put you off playing this one often.If you have a few controllers and like to play with friends, or maybe you're looking for a cheap and causal game to play, breaking your usual FPS routine, this might be the one for you. Just make sure you don't pay too much for it as you'll likely get bored rather quickly.Message to devs:This game is so close to being really well polished. Keep working on it! "

								A challenging, but rewarding and fun, arcade soccer game. The only complaints that I have are that you can't customize the teams and that you have to grind to get the good teams. You should be able to play as whoever you want from the start. It's absurd that you have to go through hoops to unlock the well-established teams, and for what? Just the name of the team?			"

								I bought the game on the winter sale for 5.-And after one exciting hour of gameplay I would have paid the full price. I totally love the cartoon-look of the game and the more or less easy controls. I can't really fit my thoughts into sentences so here is a little list of what I liked and what I missed:+ Cartoon-looks (also the very simple menu)+ Easy-Controls+ cool Idea of slowmotion when shooting+ one Challenge in each match (for example: Dribble the ball for 20 seconds)- many frameratedrops (I have quite a very good PC)- The practice wasn't playable for me with gamepad. Keyboard always was Player 1. (maybe I did miss how to change that)- Some translation-mistakes (german)- After selecting a team, I couldn't press ""Start Match"" with gamepad. Had to do it with Keyboard- Slowmotion effect didn't really brought action to me (Maybe adding a zoom or something? 0.4 sec of slowmotion didn't really made me ""fear"" if the ball is going in or not)- Some Challenges were little bit too hard (Scoring 3 goals in 25 seconds)- too few Power-ups in 4 minutes of gameplayWhat I'm missing in the game and is probably going to come:- Character (+Ball) customization- Replays- Selectable Celebrations- Harder Challenges get rewarded more- Online-matches- Some more crazyness (chaotic gamemodes, ((((playing as animals :D)))))       --> more powerups in 4 minute matchesI definitly will write another review of this game in some months, when development is more advanced.I also can't wait to play this game with a group of friends (5 Player can play local).The developer Merixgames did a very good joob for this point.Hope the review is helping you to buy this cool game!

								Im not a fan of football or the games in general but I do love this game. The controls are great the shots are powerful and the animations are damn funny(especially the celebrations and the way the goalie gets KO'd after a tough shot) It may look simple but theres a nice amount of depth under that colourful paint job. We also have local multiplayer for up to 8 players who can also join you online, a great feature that more PC games should support IMO. Lots of achievements if your into that sort of thing. Few little glitches here and there but the devs are vocal in the forums and I have no doubt any issues will be cleared up soon. IMO this game wipes the pitch with Fifa/Pro...its just more fun.Highly recommended.			"

												Kopanito is another pretty funny game without players. But that's not the fault of the game. Playing Kopanito is entertaining and challenging even in single player mode. But I assume Kopanito was intended to be developed as a stunning multiplayer experience. And that's the problem, cause there are way too few players and therefore it's hard to make online-matches. Anyway, despite the stupid teammate-AI and some minor bugs, which occured while the game was in EA, you will become a well designed, well balanced and easy to learn, difficult to master experience. It's really worth a try and I wish the game would become the attention it deserves.			"

								I find Kopanito as a great entertainment. It has even better playability than SWOS. It's a great achievment, because it's much more advanced than Sensible Software masterwork. As in SWOS you used one key to any action (passing, lobing striking, tackling) - here you have 5-6. But do not worry - difficulty levels will help you to advance (or you can still have lot of fun on the easiest difficulty setting). Creative and dynamic game, lot of fun (e.g. super powers) - the all you want.			"

								This game is fun and simple, as others have said. It's a good game to play with people who maybe aren't into games like fifa which are more complex (as much as a football game can be). There are however clear problems with the game that need to be fixed before the game is something I would recommend. CONS:The AI man the AI. The AI really really needs to be fixed. On any difficulty the AI will always have perfect aim with its slide tackles, which you'll soon realize are the key meta to the game. This wouldn't really be a problem if slide tackling wasn't so difficult for human player. Sure you get better as you play but forget playing with your girlfriend when the AI never misses a slide (unless you juke, but thats a whole other thing). The AI also passes and shoots stupidly fast. It just looks like the developers added no margin of error for the AI. Its like fifa if all the sliders were at 100. The game can be fun and rewarding but its quiet annoying when the AI has pixle perfect slides and passes that will never ever miss. And of course the AI can gage the slide distance perfectly so be prepared to be tackled at the max distance you can be tackled from.I hope the game does well and gets the updates it needs but in its current state, you'll be left shaking your head. That said, none of that will really make you lose. Shooting is fun and quick to learn so youll soon be scoring from 40 yards. But the fun times are really limited when you have to dance around the perfect AI all game. TLDR: Just make it so the AI can miss sometimes.			"

It's also very skillbased gameplay, which makes this a very addictive experience, combined with the usual soccer fun. It has very few flaws if any. Power-ups are crazy, but also very rewarding. It also has plenty of additional achievements to get during any random match, which is good. It's a suprisingly easy to control game, but difficult to master. Oh and yes you can friendly-fire your own, whether through a shot or sliding. It's currently on a discount which should seriously make this an insta-buy for the money. Good online fun as well, which should be no surprise. Art style is good. It's perhaps not super detailed and such, but it has it's own style and it's fun to watch. I haven't been as excited about a soccer game since the Fifa series essentially dropped most of the skillbased control and added a lot of semi-automatic nonsense. Not the case with this game, you'll feel in control. And team AI is great.			"

								I purchased this game in a whim, and it has turned out to be one of the best Soccer games I have played in a long time. I am enjoying it much better than the Fifa amd PES series games.Pros:-Fun and quirky, not super serious but also very competitive.-Game runs well-Great for short bursts of play time (for people who don't have a lot of free time for gaming)-Online is coming soon- AI is pretty goodCons:-Lack of customization options-Would like a ""create a characte"" or ""create a team"" optionOverall, this game is a ton of fun, and definitely worth a try.

								I bought the game after the update people are complaining about. They say this new feature of manual passes makes the game hard to play.I have played for 2 days and I won South America's cup in pro and European in amateur. I score more than 2 goals average and I found manual passes a great opportunity of avoiding enemies. With manual passes you can make depth passes not viable with auto passes.The game is fun. Enemies starts being nice but as soon as you make 2, 3 or more goals (depends on the team) they start playing harder and passing the ball a lot. That makes the gameplay funny and not so repetitive.It would be great to have more options of gameplay. Not sure what, but I'm affraid to get bored of playing it. Taunts, fights, reactions or another feature other than tackling and shooting. I'm not the creative guy, sry. Maybe a precise pass just like precise shot will also be another fun feature. A referee to kick (?) and who knows what another bizarre gameplay feature could be added to make it even more funny :)I think it needs some work on ambience and emotions. When you win, your team leaves the field just like they enter at the beggining of the match. To be honest, I bought the game because it's on sale. I think I wouldn't pay $12 in its current state. "

												I was looking for a relaxing game I could play to have fun.Well, I found it in All Star Soccer.It reminds me of my early Amiga Sensible Soccer in its friendly gameplay, with a modern cartoonish design both in graphics and gameplay.There are lots of frustrating things though.- the game has no fouls so it's a tackle party where no one ever gets injured, no goalies etc.- the controls are a bit too fidgety for my taste- the player switching is ok but not very bright and gets frustrating sometimes- the slowdown after a kick is painfully too slow to the point of frustrating- the game has some power ups but not quite enough.Overall a fun game which really much lacks ambition (more powers, better controls, no team management whatsoever).

								Saw this on sale and bought it on impulse as I didn't have any kind of football game in my collection.  What followed was a few hrs of fun for a couple of pounds spent.  Don't expect propper football, this isn't the game for that... What it is a funny and yet simple to master football game that can be played by up to 5 people at the same time... either on the same team (each player controls a single on screen player) or against each other on opposite teams. The 4 basic super powers add an element of fun and frustration to the game... having the ball snatched away from you as you line up your shot by the magnet power for example, or freezing the defense/keeper to allow you to stroll the ball over the line... It's all good fun that can and will have you and your friends screaming and cursing at each other in some good natured rivalry.It's definitely worth a couple of pounds... even if only played on game nights with friends.

If you're itching to return to the FIFA games of the SNES era, Kopanito is a charming mix of nostalgic arcade-y action and modern features you'd expect in a newer title.  Great fun in single-player.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet, but imagine it will feel like NBA Jam, or NFL blitz.  Get it!			"

												The game features online play and a host of offline modes for cooperative and competitive play: friendlies, custom tournaments, regional cups, and full-season leagues. A typical control scheme supports passes, shots, and slide tackles; shots can be manually shaped. As an arcade sports title, games have a fast pace, with powerful slide tackles the primary means to catch up and steal the ball. In addition, randomized super moves (a ball magnet, teleportation, super shot, and wind-driven goal defense) increase scoring. The AI opponents play well at a range of difficulty settings, though friendly players don’t push up the field enough (making cooperative play much more desirable). Kopanito All-Stars Soccer is an enjoyable, accessible arcade sports title.

								Do you wanna play FIFA, with realistic ball physics and ultra crisp 3d models?  Then step away and go jump on origins.  Do you want to get a couple of firneds together and jump into a simplified soccer game that has old school charm with modern accessibility?  Then you've found your hiddne gem.This game is quite simple to play.  Essentially pass,shoot and turbo buttons.  You also get the ability to slow-mo bend the ball every tiume you shoot.  This allows you to pull off some amazing ""banana"" kicks in your first game.  It's just good arcade sports game fun that reminds why I loved games like NHL 94 so much back in the day.You can check out some game footage here.

I think you should make them have their own unique super move. So it's like this: 75% chance to get your team's supermove and 25% chance of getting the other supermoves. Something like that.Also the Keeper AI isn't as good as most football/soccer games. You should improve that.Also please make the amateur difficulty just slightly easier.			"

								I did not want to give a negative review for this game as it is in early access, and the developer does seem to listen to the gamers and work hard, but after only few hours playing, I feel it was more negative then positive at this stage, even though there is a bit of potential in the game as well as an arcade football game.However, the way the game is right now, all be it in early access, it is very tedious and frustrating and gets boring quite quickly.The difficulty jump between each setting is quite high I found, and even on amateur was a challenge because the computer AI tends to be able time things very well indeed when for the player it is much more of a challenge, this is ok, but does get frustrating.There also is not a lot to the gameplay, it gets very samey with so little options and things going on, you tend to get very bored quite quickly. pass, shoot, pass, shoot, pass, shoot with the odd sliding tackle now and again when you can time it right, and trust me, it's more difficult then you think.As I say, I reluctantly make this a negative review, I wish there was an option for 'neutral' or 'mixed' as I did not hate it, but it did get tedious.But I will still be following the progress of the game, and see where it goes as there is potential, but it does need a lot more things added to it because even as an arcade game there isn't much to it, obviously we don't expect Fifa options, but basic things like heading aren't even in the game, which while isn't a gamechanger, put ten or so little things like that to the game and it becomes better, The developer does seem to take notice of the feedback and I applaud him, but right now I won't be playing it again for a bit, but will still follow its progress.Also PLEASE DO NOT listen to people saying it is a sensible soccer or kick off successor, it really isn't at all.

								I think this game is very fun and once you get used to manual passing the game is much more enjoyable. If you're used to FIFA's auto passing this may prove to be challenging at first, but eventually becomes manageable. Love the Super Moves and the fact that there are no red cards. Let the tackles begin! Fun, silly soccer game. I'm able to play it with my PS3 and Xbox One controllers with no problems.			"

								I like these less serious sports games. I dont need a total simulation every time.This game is pretty awesome for what it is. It is like Nintendo World Cup or Super Dodgeball for NES. Those were some of my favorite games from that era. This has that kind of feel with Supermoves and no penalties. The powerups are creative with ball magnets and fans behind the goal to blow the ball away, and teleportation...ect. The control is pretty good. You can do a variety of shots and passes and whatnot and a cool sniper shot slo mo precise shot. Brought it out of my evergrowing game backlog, Im glad I finally played it.			"

								This could totally be the arcade football game we've been missing. The game is very promising, once you get past the one-hour or so learning curve, the game is very fun, all the more against friends. You can score pretty nice goals once you get the hang of it, and the power moves are a great idea. Multiplayer is coming along which is very exciting. You should definitely give this a try.			"

								[UPDATE 24/08/2016 - after Online Multiplayer patch]As I promised, I want to update my review by including a feedback about Online Multiplayer.My overall opinion is Online Multiplayer is badly implemented, plain and simple.Nice to choose the different modes, too bad you click on 2v2 and you get put in a 1v1 match.This would be solved easily by introducing a lobby before the match start, so players can join and wait for the game to be filled with enough players to have a 2v2(3v3,4v4 etc.) or quit before the match starts, no?You can't choose the teams, you can't switch sides if you end up 3v1, you can't do nothing.Very meh.Another issue is ping.This game heavily depends on a good ping to be decent, otherwise it's a torture.Sadly you can't see your or other players' ping, you only find out while playing and that's not really fun.I think the Online Multiplayer can be improved A LOT with some little changes here and there, sadly this game has a little online community (I've seen 50 to 70 players online).The game sometimes randomly freeze, btw.And players don't hook correctly the ball even if you run over it, that's very annoying.I recommend this game only if you buy it with some friends to play together, otherwise it may not be the best purchase of your life.[EDIT: 10/06/2016 after patch, I will probably update it again after the Online Multiplayer patch]I tried this game and I'm honest: it would be fun if played with/against other humans. Very fun.Sad thing is: this game has only singleplayer and local multiplayer.The problem is that playing in singleplayer made me notice many annoying faults this game has:- Controls [EDITED] -> after the change of passes and the aerial moves, now it's better and even the CPU has to deal with the no-auto passes, giving you room for intercepts.I still think the slides could be more accurate.- Gameplay is fun, but repetitive against CPU.- Difficulty not quite balanced.- The shooting mechanic is slow to react to inputs and can't be canceled by a pass, annoying.- Powers are fun but they charge too slow to really be enjoyed and they are random.- a bug stuck the GK and the match couldn't go on, I lost all the tournament because of that.. not cool.Another major issue is the lack of online multiplayer and who knows when this game will have it.Is it a problem to buy a game at 3,50€ and hope to play it online, one day?I think it's wiser to wait for this game to have more features and some mechanics rebalanced, before buying it.The singleplayer isn't very fun but the multiplayer may have some potential, in future.I hope to change my mind about this game.

								7 Feb 16: Being that it is still in early access, I'll give the devs the benefit of the doubt on this one. I really enjoy soccer games overall, especially ones that don't take it too seriously. Mario Strikers Charged was one of my all-time favorites and the existing reviews, when I bought Kopantio, reflected the same love for the Wii title.What I love about this one are:-The number of teams and tournaments available-The fact that the teams are small. Five a side plus keeps is perfect. -Trick shots and trick defence.-The price is not unreasonable at allThat said, what I find troubling:-The fact that a majority of the teams and tournaments need to be unlocked and the easier difficulties may still too hard to unlock the things you want to unlock-The slide-tackling mechanic needs work. Missing a slide tackle is fun when your opponent jukes you, but not when you were a micrometer off on your analog joystick-My plug in controllers were garbage in Practice mode, but somehow work in other modesOne more troubling thing I should mention:I have a 10 minute rule, where if I can't have a meaningful game play experience in 10 minutes, I ask for a refund. I did this with Crusader Kings II, as I didn't have a clue of what I was doing. Anyway, It took me a good 20 minutes to figure out the plug in controller situation (I broke my own rule because I wanted to like this game so much). My advice to devs is this: Make this bug your highest priority. People like me don't have too much patience for this.			"

GameplayThe gameplay isn’t bad, but it’s not great either.  However, after the most recent patch it has become frustrating.    Passing use to be direct, but now you have to chase after passes-typically by backtracking.  When you get to the ball you may have to circle back to it once or twice to even pick it up, but by then the AI will have picked it up in one swoop.Play as your favorite team?I have played 4 hours in and haven’t even unlocked any European teams, so I do not know how hard it is to unlock them.  However, if you want to play your home country and it happens to be Japan, Australia, Mexico, Canada, the US to name a few, then good luck.  You will have to win a specific tournament on Professional (hard).  For the US, you have to beat 5 tournaments to even unlock the specific tournament.  So if you can get good enough, by the time you do, you may be tired of the game.BugsMy keeper has gotten caught multiple times behind his own net during corner kicks, where I have to go in and out of menus to try to get him unstuck (then I often give up a goal because of it).  My keeper has run off the screen with the ball until the half ended.  My keeper has kicked balls backwards on goal kicks and passes, once scoring an own goal (since the last update), and that is not counting the time he leaps out of bounds with the ball…or leaps with the ball into his own net.  On low difficulties this is forgivable, but on higher difficulties it is infuriating.OverallThis game has potential, and I would consider changing my review if they fixed two big issues: allow players to unlock everything from easy modes and remove the new passing update.  However, I can’t recommend it in its current as I feel it has strayed too far from being an arcade-style soccer game. "

								I stopped playing football games a long time ago because the simulated realism was taking over the arcade fun of the genre. I can't stand the sport as a real thing but casual arcade fun is great so I saw this and thought ""hmm this looks like jokes"" The thing that got me is that it is both fun and serious which is fantastic. I don't have to watch stupid transfers and training; I can just play but I have to play well. There's a lot of skill involved in playing this but not necessarily at the start which is good. It gives you time to warm to the controls and play around with the super skills - which are hilarious.Overall, the game may look silly but it's a real football game. The one thing that threw me off was that I had hoped it was an online multiplayer but unfortunately not. Seeing as it is still in Early Access, hopefully that is something on the developers list for later. Either way, it's a great game with loads of content and local multiplayer is possible.			"

								Now I've played this game for awhile now, and I feel as if the new update has ruined the game. The graphics are very enjoyable and the gameplay is very close to perfect. I really like how they are hyping up online multiplayer but with the new passing the game has become bad. If you don't have a controller it is impossible to make a pass. You can only go diagonaly and in the cardinal directions.The manual passing has RUINED the game. I really used to like it, but now its very difficult to. Also, the auto-switching when passing has made it even worse. They add new goals and make them EXTREMELY difficult.Cross it in the middle, oh no, my player is running away. In general I love this game, but I just can't deal with the passing. If you could have add an option in settings to use either manual or auto that would be great.7/10 to much water.(Might change my review depending on what the next few updates bring.)			"

								A great sensible soccer spiritual successor (of which there are a few here on steam, I think this may be the best) that does enough with its art design and gameplay tweaks to make things interesting. The cutesy graphics may steer some away but it really allows for smooth animations which is a must in this fast paced game. The lack of online multiplayer (which the devs are apparently working on, so bravo, look forward to it) is the only thing I see holding this back from being the top sensible-like on steam. Local is a blast so it should be a home run when they are able to get it up and running. I will disclaimer this with I did buy it when it was on sale below 5 dollars and I am not sure i would have paid full price or been as satisfied if I had. Grab it on a sale unless you are dying for this kind of gameplay (cause it certainly delivers)			"

								Esto es Jogo Bonito: KopanitoJuegos como FIFA y PES se van a los puños en sus intentos de ser el mejor simulador de fútbol, fallando de vez en cuando en sus intentos pues no logran ser lo esperado y se vuelven todo menos divertidos. Pero Kopanito All-Stars Soccer no es un simulador, es un arcade total, solo te preocupas por pasar la bola, disparar y barrerte, no hay truquitos ni jugadas de pared, esto es una legitima mejenga de barrio, sin arbitro y en eso es que brilla Kopanito.Las físicas, los gráficos de lujo y jugaditas a los Neymar se dejan de lado en Kopanito, siendo reemplazadas por risas, barridas al hueso, tiros especiales, con un estilo gráfico muy ameno –Algo parecido a SouthPark, y llamativo que incluso niños pequeños encuentran super divertido. En Kopanito todo es diversión y aunque no logremos ganar, nos vamos con una sonrisa en el rostro pues el juego es pura loquera y no hay absolutamente nada malo en él.El juego es fácil de aprender a controlar, como ya mencionamos antes, es super arcade, y más si usas un mando de Xbox, pasas el balón con A, disparas con X, centras con B al atacar, al defender lo único que tienes que hacer es usar B para barrerte y eso es todo. También tiene alguno que otro truco muy divertido como tiros especiales, tele-transportaciones (si, eso que hace Goku), hasta un abanico gigante nos ayudara a evitar que nos anoten.Es muy entretenido hacer barridas como desquiciado por todo el campo de juego, tanto que había momentos en los partidos que solo me concentraba en intentar barrer a los contrarios en lugar de tratar de anotar, y fue divertidísimo, pues para lograr hacer contacto con los jugadores del otro equipo también hay que tener pulso, pero valió la pena ja, ja.El juego es en 2D, acompañando su estilo arcade “semi-retro” de una manera excelente, su atractivo estético es su segunda mejor virtud, los detalles en los jugadores los hacen muy graciosos, nos harán reír a montones y más si jugamos acompañados en linea o de manera local, con jugadas increíbles y tarjetas rojas que nunca veremos llegar.Aún en Early Access, Kopanito All-Stars Soccer viene con un sin fin de selecciones nacionales, muchas deberán ser desbloqueadas al jugar distintas copas o campeonatos de selecciones,  con posibilidad de hasta 5 controles a la vez de manera local (4 mandos y 1 teclado), con dificultades que incluso los niños pueden probar sin problemas hasta el más difícil que nos hará intentar romper el control.Kopanito es divertido, rápido y  sencillo, los juegos de fútbol ya no te hacen reír, Kopanito All-Stars Soccer lo hará de sobra.Más de 100 equipos nacionales, 16 torneos, 7 estadios y hasta 600+ jugadores únicos no son suficientes, pues también tenemos la posibilidad de crear nuestros propios equipos, estadios y balones. Los desarrolladores han incluido 4 distintas ligas por medio de Steam Leaderboards, empezaremos en la Liga Bronce donde conforme ganemos partidos de torneo (solos o co-op) obtendremos puntos de fama, lo cuales necesitamos para avanzar a las ligas mas altas.Kopanito es divertido, rápido y  sencillo, si los juegos de fútbol ya no te hacen reír, Kopanito All-Stars Soccer lo hará de sobra. No me reía tanto al jugar un juego de fútbol desde… Bueno, es la primera vez que me río demasiado jugando un titulo de fútbol, no sabia que podía haber “friendly fire” en un juego de soccer, ja ja. Incluso si no te gustase el deporte practicado en Kopanito, te puede gustar demasiado jugarlo con amigos.Pros:+Divertidísimo+Jugabilidad arcade buenísima+No hay arbitro!+Hasta 5 personas local+Desarrolladores activosCons:–El precio regular esta un poquito alto–Los equipos iniciales son muy limitados (Pero se desbloquean conforme ganas torneos)			"

								It's a really funny game but at the moment it has a lot of annoying bugs.- I spent some time to understand how start a match (don't know why the players didn't join the field alone! I had to figure out which buttons allow you to start it)- I had some visual lag during the game (and I have 2 970GTX)- After a goal sometimes the camera get stucked in a super zoom mode that makes the game unplayable (this zoom is removed only when the opponent scores... not if you score...)As I sayd this game it's really fun and if the fix those bugs will worth the buy absolutly! But at the moment it's a NO, also because of the price of 12€! Keep work on it and add the multiplayer with more players also online :)			"

								Wow, awesome game. :) I can confirm this game works with a Dual Action Logitech controller very nicely as well (mine might be an older model). The game is fun to play number one. The slide tackles, passing, shooting.. are all nice. The controls are nice as well on the keyboard, and are configurable. Some of the default keys are the arrow keys to move, and d and s for passing. I've been using the contoller mostly, but the keyboard is easy as well.The league I tried is nice so far as well. I'm 2-4 so far, but won my last 2 games. It was hard to score at first as I didn't know the score button (button 3 on my controller). I'm looking forward to seeing this game develop, but a blast to play now as well.			"

								This used to be a lot of fun until an update changed the way ball passing works. Passing used to work well where you press A to pass the ball to another player in your direction. Now, pressing A basically shoots the ball, so to pass the ball you have to basically aim your shoot on your team mate, which is stupid and makes the playbility bad and difficult.Not recommended anymore.

Cons:- The performance is worse than most AAA games and the FPS oscillation is a very annoying thing that overly affects gameplay- Sometimes match crashes for no reason and you must restart the match- AI is a big problem in this game. It cheats many times and do the same movement every time- The shot without precise shot is a♥♥♥♥♥♥and go anywhere instead where you aim. Almost impossible to make a goal without precise shot.- The impossibility of head the ball makes corner kicks a key of sucess to make goals, mainly for AIPros:- Many achievements.- Rebind controls, even on xbox controller (there is a bug to rebind B button, but if you hold it, you can bypass the ""return to the previous menu"")			"

								I was hoping this would be an improvement over games like Fifa which require ridiculous commands to be able to play. The learning curve from beginner to amateur level is immense and seemingly insurmountable. Things that would let the computer take the ball from the player have no result when the player attempts them against the computer. Maybe if a player learned the secret commands the computer seemingly has access to (as well as instant knowledge of all actions taken without consideration for human reaction time) the playing field would be more level.

								Pretty entertaining game overall with relatively easy controls, consistant action, and satisfying goals. Local co-op is definitely a plus as well! However, there are two major improvements that will convince me to give this a thumbs up:- Improved netcode: I have a fast internet connection and decent setup but the responsiveness in an online game is miserable. I noticed that my opponent was having the same problems. Everything from switching characters in the timely manner, tackling when actually pressing the button, and passing was affected- Information about how many players are in each online game mode: There is a count in the bottom-left of the mode select screen that says how many players are online and how many are waiting for a game. However, with so many game types (5 or 6, iirc) it would be a huge help to see what modes people are waiting to play. Its great to see that 2 people are in the game lobby waiting to play but it would save a lot of trial and error to just tell me what game I should select so I can play with them. Likewise, if I'd like to play 3v3 with randoms, it'll increase their chances of finding me in that lobby if that lobby notated that there is somebody waiting in it.This is a fun game but these are areas that need improvement to make it fun to play online.

Can not switch player when AI shoots. AI with no margin of error. Tackles ineffective against AI (ball snatch). Quick shot controls non functional. I'd love to play more if it wasn't such a disaster.

Has a bit of a learning curve when it comes to mastering it but easy to pick up and play. Just can't wait for the multiplayer to be ready and then this game will shine...			"

Jump shots and bicycle kicks are missing in the game. But however this game is the best alternative to Goal 3 on PC. :)			"

								Ok so this game here is a prime example of why Steam should allow users to have an 'its ok' button with which to review things, because thats exactly what this game is: its ok, its right smack dab in the middle of whether i could reccomend it or not. However, thats not to say that its a bad game, quite the opposite; it runs smoothly, the controls are intuitive, and the art style and graphics are fine at the very least.But it is limited. If you get this game then dont really expect anything more than a time waster, a good time waster mind you, but thats about it. The simplicity of the game is also it downfall, making it very hard to play for advanced tactics, as you can LITERALLY run circles around the opponent and win.It may also dissapoint anyone whos a fan of the more serious football games e.g. FIFA, because some basic game mechanics that you would expect to see are nowhere to be found. For example I will constantly pass to my team mate and start running with him, only to find that HE LEFT THE STUPID BALL BEHIND!!! And that was from a pass directly to him! So, yeh, players wont always latch onto the ball if you pass to them, also your friendly AI can be so stupid and not auto-run onto the ball if its landed right near them.Dont be put off though, it still has some great mechanics which it utilises perfectly: for one, the slow-mo precision shots are great and pulling off a shot curved right around the keeper feels fantastic! Furthermore the power up system is a nice touch and all the power ups tend to balance out nicely, with some being more O.P than others but never to an unfair extent - yes im looking at you Blue Shell    >:(I picked this game up on sale so really I'm quite pleased, but looking at its current full release price it would be hard to make a case for buying it, especially as its currently single player and local co-op only, though the developers are quite active and have said that theyre working on an online multiplayer feature, which honestly it really needs as the AI can be laughable at times, and ridiculously skilled at others, basically seems a little unbalanced.If you do pick this up then I would strongly recommend playing with a controller, makes the game way more friendly for new players, however be aware that if you pause a match using the controller, you will have to press A/X (xbox/ps) to resume the match which, because of the button mapping, will make your player pass the ball unintentionally, or just change players all together - Very Annoying so try and remember to use the mouse to close the pause menu.In summary, yes definitely pick this game up on sale, but give it a little thought before purchasing at full price. However you can completely ignore me on that one if the devs have added in more features, because online multiplayer would definitely make the price tag more appealing.			"

								Basically Super Mario Strikers on Steam, it's a nice arcade soccer game. Not going to be a ""simulator"" soccer game but that's fine, the game has substance and a plethora of tournaments and modes to keep you going.The GIF generator is a great idea, but it's a little slow and taxing on the game. If that gets refined, plus online mode (which is confirmed to come anyway), this game will be pretty much done and ready for release.			"

								Edit: my negative review was based on a very poor 0.7 patch. Developers have obviously recognized their mistakes, and things have greatly improved in 0.7.2. The tweaks and new features add to the game depth, big props to the devolpment team for their fast and appropriate reaction.In its current state, I can recommend the game again, fun and totally worth its price.When I bought this game, I had a very pleasant surprise. A fun & fast paced arcade soccer game filled with good ideas which I would play casually and enjoy quite a bit.Well, that was a few patches ago. Now everything feels unreliable : the (new) manual passing, the air play, your players movements and AI... + the game often randomly hangs after some matches. My last sessions of play were pretty much only frustration, and made me want to forget this game for good. While I appreciate the developers efforts to improve and spice their game, I cannot enjoy anymore a game that makes me want to throw my controller away every 5 minutes, and I certainly do not want to spend a hundred hours mastering a broken gameplay just to be able to play decently.A few months ago this game was immediate fun, now it is endless frustration.

								My friend recommended this game to me. At first it appears really fun. But there're 3 problems really makes me sick:1. If you got kicked out during a tournament, then the game is dead: mucis is playing, screen is frozen, no button pressing is working any more. I believe this is a bug.2. The AI really makes me frustrated: I choose the beginner AI level( the easiest one I suppose), then during the game I saw AI players pass the ball from their penalty area to my penalty area without any dribble, literally without any dribble! And then AI scores and this happens all the time during my game experience. So you tell me this is the easiest AI?3. The game control is really uncomprehensible to me. For example, in practice mode, I passed to my teammate. He caught the ball and then ran WITHOUT it. I got a really hard time trying to dribble.In conclusion, either this game really have these problems or maybe I'm just really bad at this kind of game.			"

								This is a perfect game for someone that wants to experience the simple fun of the old fifa games (fifa98) with a modern twist.  The Graphics are nothing to brag about but they match the game accordingly. Its all about fun the inputs and controls feel perfect when mastered. Has a bit of a learning curve when it comes to mastering it but easy to pick up and play. Just can't wait for the multiplayer to be ready and then this game will shine...			"

I feel like there's a big chunk of mechanics missing as well, like the x button should do something on defense.  Arial plays; headers, chest traps, and bicycle kicks are completely absent.  one-timers need to be smoothed a little. "

								My friend recommended this game to me. At first it appears really fun. But there're 3 problems really makes me sick:1. If you got kicked out during a tournament, then the game is dead: mucis is playing, screen is frozen, no button pressing is working any more. I believe this is a bug.2. The AI really makes me frustrated: I choose the beginner AI level( the easiest one I suppose), then during the game I saw AI players pass the ball from their penalty area to my penalty area without any dribble, literally without any dribble! And then AI scores and this happens all the time during my game experience. So you tell me this is the easiest AI?3. The game control is really uncomprehensible to me. For example, in practice mode, I passed to my teammate. He caught the ball and then ran WITHOUT it. I got a really hard time trying to dribble.In conclusion, either this game really have these problems or maybe I'm just really bad at this kind of game.			"

								This is a great little soccer game. It's strongly reminiscent of the classic Sensible Soccer, with economical button usage that's sensitive to length of press and the stick's position. You can pull of some crazy skillful moves once you become comfortable with the controls. I haven't tried the online multiplayer yet but local mp and vs AI are both a lot of fun.			"

Art style is nice, all be it a little ""cutesy"" it fits well with the style of the game. Easily a solid 7.5-8 out of 10 gamewould definately recommend			"

								Pretty fun game! I've currently only got two hours of play time, but I can say the game is a blast. It's a simplistic soccer game, no fouls or refs which is nice, allows for constant game play (like rocket league). Controls were a bit odd for me at first, took a couple of games to get used to it but now its comfortable. Even though the game is in early access, I've only had one crash on me in those two hours, and the game had kept my progress so when it wasn't an issue. Fun game with tons to unlock, for $12 why the hell not?			"

Early Access Review
								Edit: my negative review was based on a very poor 0.7 patch. Developers have obviously recognized their mistakes, and things have greatly improved in 0.7.2. The tweaks and new features add to the game depth, big props to the devolpment team for their fast and appropriate reaction.In its current state, I can recommend the game again, fun and totally worth its price.When I bought this game, I had a very pleasant surprise. A fun & fast paced arcade soccer game filled with good ideas which I would play casually and enjoy quite a bit.Well, that was a few patches ago. Now everything feels unreliable : the (new) manual passing, the air play, your players movements and AI... + the game often randomly hangs after some matches. My last sessions of play were pretty much only frustration, and made me want to forget this game for good. While I appreciate the developers efforts to improve and spice their game, I cannot enjoy anymore a game that makes me want to throw my controller away every 5 minutes, and I certainly do not want to spend a hundred hours mastering a broken gameplay just to be able to play decently.A few months ago this game was immediate fun, now it is endless frustration.

								First off, I'd like to say I suck at passing. I'm trying to get better but still. That means I need one guy to run around doing crazy moves around everyone on professional difficulty, and for some reason, it's so hard I jump up and cheer when I score like in a NBA Finals game (wink wink cavs).

PROS:Good AI SystemTons of Teams/balls/fields to choose fromCons:Game freezes if you pause it when the final whistle blowsPowerups are too sparse to feel relevantNo in-game music. Just grunts of players and the cheer of the crowd.This game has a lot of potential and most of my gripes with it are minimal so I still give it a thumbs up.			"

The AI offers as much competition as you can handle, which is good because I have yet to find an online game.
