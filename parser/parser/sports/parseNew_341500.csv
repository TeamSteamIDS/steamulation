												Finally finished the game! This game is definitely very unique and really put in an amazing effort to incorporate puzzle and platformer to a new level. The game's difficulty had a pretty good progression and did really great job to make players think for themselves and find out themselves how to go to the next level - which, by the way, is very satisfying when you did figure it out.The most fun parts are where there are more than one way to solve the majority of the puzzles. There are some where you can pretty much just solve it one way; however, these are essential ""skills"" (in terms of knowledge / know-how) that you would be using later on. It's very satisfying figuring out how to do it and then being able to use them on the levels later on.This game also has a HIGH replay value! If you just initially went for the next level, you might want to tackle the game a bit differently the next time you try the same level by exploring more around the levels and finding mementos (sort of pretty much like item collection) which reveal more about the setting/situation. There are also medals where you can try to use the least amount of times you must use your ability(camera) which makes you view the game on more of a ""thinking/puzzle"" level. And lastly of course, there's also the finish the level as fast as possible medals. I can TOTALLY see this as a great game for Speed Runs.Not to mention! They also have a level editor. So... you finished the game? Time to bust out some of what you've learned from just finishing the game and make your own level! Not very many games I know has this kind of feature that's something I would think only the developers would have and not share to people. Highly recommended and worth the money.Try it out! It's one of those games that I'd say: ""yeah, that was pretty unique and fun."" It just hits the right amount of satisfaction for platformers and puzzle solvers alike.			"

												Brilliant!I'm having a blast playing Camera Obscura. The unique art style is great and really gives me a fun and retro-indie feel, but with a professional polish. Combined with such an amazing sound track that's worth a purchase all on its own, this game experience has been exactly what I was hoping for. Immersive, challenging, lighthearted, and rewarding.The learning curve does a wonderful job at consistently testing your perceivable boundaries and pushing you to break them over and over as new obstacles are tossed your way. Each time I overcome an interesting hurdle in Camera Obscura I'm always left with both a rewarding feeling and the curious notion of whether or not that was the only solution to the puzzle. The snapshot ""afterimage"" mechanic is so clever in the unbelievable number of unforseen ways it can be used and in how easily it adapts to the user's play style. I found myself constantly discovering new ways to solve simple and complex puzzles, even surprising myself with solutions I hadn't seen at first.The controls feel very smooth and play wonderfully with a game pad. Which is of paramount importance in a platformer that pushes you to break your limits. You can play with joystick or D-pad on a controller, or with a keyboard if preferred, the game doesn't limit you with any one option, but a gamepad definitely was a good choice.The story is as much a beautiful puzzle as the rest of the game. I found it to be both mysterious and intreuging. At first I had the intention of speeding through the levels to prove that I could overcome each challenge, but after falling into the story I now want to revisit each stage to find the little missing pieces of the overall plot that are tucked in every corner.Overall I feel that Camera Obscura really nailed the delivery with this fantastic Puzzle-Platformer Adventure.I'd recommend this title to anyone looking for a high spirited and fun filled experience that will challenge them to think outside the box and push their limits!Enjoy!!

												I really wanted to like this game, but I can't play it anymore.  It could be that I suck hardcore with games like this, but then again, maybe this game is for someone else.  Probably not the average player though.I only got through the first two sets of levels and I really did like how the dev integrated puzzle solving within the platforming genre, giving the genere a brand new direction to take.  Kudos on how muitple solutions existed, where only the end-goal mattered and it was up to the player for how resourceful and time-efficient the solution is.What really got me was the stiffness of the mechanics since it was more frusterating than satisfying.  From the automatic timing of when the afterimage becomes stationary to the bulkiness of the character, I didn't feel I had enough control over my character and her tools to feel satisfied whenever I solved a level.  I wasn't able to place the afterimage exactly where I wanted to, and there wasn't much brains involved compared to split-second movements. It is a charming game with good art and clever design choices.  But due to the frusteration is caused me, it's not a game for everyone.  If you are willing to put up with stiff mechanics and support an indie developer with incredible potential, by all means get this game.  Otherwise, you're not missing much other than a lot of frusteration.			"

												Camera Obscura is a very simplistic looking side-scroller, that is reminiscent of something on the NES or Super NES. What makes this particular game different from other similar games is our ability to manipulate your surroundings by taking a photograph. When you take a photograph it creates an afterimage which you can then manipulate for a few seconds to create obstacles, bridges, stairs etc. There are 57 levels of the tower you must climb and each level contains photographs you can collect. The levels are timed allowing you to earn up to a gold star if you complete it withina certain length of time. As you progress the difficulty becomes greater with wild animals, and dangerous traps. For as simplistic as it looks, it is actually a lot of fun. You can really toy around with the afterimage effect and explore.From what I understand there is also a custom level editior with this game meaning you can make your own levels and share them on the steam workshop. This would be very interesting to see how creative and insane of levels people can come up with. All in all, it is a decent buy. Probably best to buy it as part of the developer aliance bundle so you have a few other games to play around with as well,			"

												What the...?! I play this game way too much...This game is a platformer with a nice atmosphere, an entertaining gimmick, and great speedrunning potential. I'm actually speedrunning this game these days.This is a standard platformer with one difference, you can copy surrounding platforms and place them elsewhere, temporarily creating new platforms.This game gives you medals for two things: using your ability the least amount of times, and beating the level ASAP. In the 2nd condition's case, basically an Individual Level (IL) speedrun. It gets very addicting as, first you route the best path to speedrun, then you keep resetting a level over and over again until you get that perfect run with minimum mistakes and high optimization. I actually postponed beating the main game for about 30 hours just so I could shave milliseconds off of my previous run.And then one of my friends inevitably finds a better route and the cycle continues. I have over 100 hours in this game, so ya listen to me. If you want to get into speedrunning, this is like a gateway drug.Also, get the Developers Alliance Bundle. I recommend the 3 other games, too. Out There Somewhere is especially popular.			"

												This game is a great experience. Utilizing a fascinating mechanic of taking a 'snapshot' of your surroundings to solve each level, it proves that simplicity is often the most effective. As you climb the tower more and more of the story is revealed to you and drives you to discover more. As the levels mount in difficulty you need to take everything the game has taught you thus far into account. The puzzles are lovely to look at and challenging, with wonderful music following you as you go. It is a great feeling when you finally crack the secret of each level.Definitely worth 7.79! Have fun!!     "

Basic InformationTitle:  Camera ObscuraDeveloper:  Anteater GamesPublisher:  EQ-Games, Anteater GamesGenre:  Classic style platformerGeneral ImpressionCamera Obscura (“Dark Chamber” in Latin) is a 2D platformer that pays homage to old school 2D platformers but also tries to innovate with a pretty interesting gameplay mechanic. The game’s story revolves around the quest of photographer to climb the ruins of a tower. And the innovation comes in the manipulation of the levels themselves in a similar manner to Fez. But the afterimage effect is more than just a gimmick and it works very well with the storyline. It is not an easy game and you will be restarting levels often enough. The soundtrack is surprisingly good for a platformer and the introduction of Achievements and Trading Cards make Camera Obscura, a nice addition to any collection.Strong Points+ Clever gameplay mechanics.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Quite difficult.- Sparse save checkpoints.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Since the game's release I've put about eight hours into it, about split evenly between level progression and trying to get the various medals. It's proven to be a very addicting game, as I'm finding myself saying 'okay one more try' or 'let me see what this next level is' many times. It's also very fun, there's not much to it apart from the various platforming elements. There's still some stuff in the trailer I haven't gotten to yet, so the game doesn't throw everything at you right away, and each level is pretty different. The platforming is nice and tight, as you're able to control how hard you jump, which comes in handy during speedruns when you just need to make a little hop. Respawns are quick, or if you want to restart the level, that's very fast as well. The camera element, or 'flashing', is interesting. Essentially, when you hit X, you make an afterimage of the background, which follows you for about two seconds before stopping, and then stays there for a few seconds more. You use this to create steps, lift enemies, and get to places you otherwise couldn't reach. It will take a bit of time to master this, as you'll have to learn when is the best time to jump before the platform halts its movement. But when you do you'll be able to move around levels like a pro.Each level has a Time challenge and a Flash challenge. Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals for using the least amount of flashes possible, or beating it in the least amount of time. Sometimes getting gold for both happens at the same time, sometimes they're mutually exclusive. They're definitely challenging, but I wouldn't say they're unfair. Though it can be aggravating getting a time of 23.01 and you need to get a 23.00 to get the gold. But it's fun to see what shortcuts are in the levels. One that comes to mind can be completed in about five seconds, or over a minute, depending on if you know the trick or not. And when you're doing the speedruns, you'll often find the enemies are placed in juuust the right area to screw you over if you don't do it right. But then you get to do it and then you can laugh and laugh and laugh.For the story, I haven't really delved into it yet. There are mementos you can find as collectibles. The main character is a photographer, and she's looking for somebody at the top of this tower. But anything other than that I either don't know or don't want to spoil. The memento give a history of the tower you're climbing, and what you're trying to accomplish, but it's not needed to enjoy the game. Only problem I have with this is there's no indication of what levels have mementos left uncollected, so you may want to write down what mementos you find in each level, as they're at least numbered.The music is nice, I think there are about eleven tracks. They don't get repetitive and create a nice ambience for the game. Tempted to pick up the soundtrack myself. I would estimate that if you were just going through the game, trying to get to the end, it would last you at least ten hours? I'm only at the halfway point myself, and it's definitely getting harder, so it'll take longer to beat the last levels. But it still hasn't reached unfair levels of difficulty, or Braid-level lateral reasoning to beat a puzzle. But then, that time doesn't count trying to get medals, or going back for mementos you missed. I did end up spending half an hour trying to get the two golds on one tricky level, but that feeling of satisfaction after I got them, oh, that was palpable.There's also a level creator, but I haven't yet gone into that. But that's definitely something I'm looking forward to seeing after everyone develops some new levels. For the levels in the game, as I said before, there's a lot of variety. It changes the general theme of the level as you climb the tower, getting more mechanical as opposed to the stony architecture of the first levels, which is cool. There are moving platforms, switches you need to hit (or use monsters to hit), tiles that can't be flashed, tiles that need to be switched on to be flashed, and oh yes: no spikes whatsoever. If you die it's simply from falling down a pit or touching an enemy.Definitely a good purchase, especially for the price. Absolutely recommended.			"

												Camera Obscura is a platformer with an interesting mechanic, but some glaring issues when you're going for 100% completion. If you're not, it's an ok game, but you'll need some patience anyway. It has alot of unfair and unnecessarily annoying sections, that have not much to do with difficulty and platforming skills but are just plain bad level design.- horrible collision detection with enemies. The hitbox is a box with always the same size, even though some animation frames make enemies very small, filling only a tiny spot in that box (slime's fall animation, for example, for those how already know the game)- the menu has some unskippable slow fades and transitions. That gets annoying when you go through there alot. Selecting a level is especially tedious, you have to wait through multiple transitions when selecting a level.- ugly graphics. There are alot of games out there that prove that 2D pixel graphics can look great. This game is the opposite.- no restart level button, you have to go through the menu to restart the level, which you will do ALOT.- no on screen timer. When you try to beat specific level times for medals and achievements, you have no idea how you are doing, until you see the end screen.- when you start a level (coming from the previous level or the level select menu), there is a fade-in time during which you can't see anything, but the level timer has started anyway. For beating the times, you regularly will want to immediately restart the stage to start without the fade-in.- the story is presented in text snippets. Yes, simple text, nothing else. Not even an interesting or eye-pleasing font.- several levels have long boring sections where you are just walking or even just waiting for a moving platform, for example. And you will have to repeat those sections alot, because afterwards there is no checkpoint and some difficult section follows. You'll die alot, and you'll wait through the boring section again and again in each retry.			"

												This is a very difficult game that is a mix between a platformer and a puzzler. Due to the difficulty of this game, i abadoned it myself because im basically stuck on a floor i cannot pass.The game, also, at this point, has been abadoned by the developers, even though some parts of the game are impossible to recover certain memento's, such as #56. If you can get it legitimately, without using the level editor, please feel free to post on the forum as everyone here would like to know too.NOT recommended for the developer abadoning a puzzle game where it is impossible to get all collectibles throught the game without cheating.  I suggest others would change their reviews to negative due to the developer abadoning their product and making it impossible to get all collectibles in it (#56 to be precise!).For more info on memento #56, please see this post:http://steamcommunity.com/app/341500/discussions/0/371918937286000866/ "

												Camera Obscura is an intresting little game. Its main selling point is a unique mechanic that allows one to manipulate the world by means of screenshots. I'd suggest that you watch the video on the store page if you havn't already to get an idea of how it works. Now the question is, is it any good? From what little I've played, I think so. The game requires you to evalute your surroundings and use the screenshots to figure out how to best solve the levels. Once you have beaten a level, you can always replay it and try to complte it in a faster time or by using less screenshots. Is it a groudbreaking game? No, not really. But for what it is, it is a pretty cool puzzle platformer. I also recommend picking up the soundtrck when it goes on sale. Not only does it compliment the game well, but it is nice to listen to on its own.			"

												I tried to like this game, I really did, but I just couldn't. The concept of the game is interesting using your camera flash to create platforms out of already existing platforms in order reach the next platform. It also has some interesting puzzles, and honestly I thought it was good at first. My biggest issue with this game however are the controls, and that's why I have a hard time reccomending this game. It even has a solid soundtrack, nothing revolutionary or super memorable but it wasn't bad by any means in fact the music is probably the best part of the game! However, the controls are extremely stiff and I dunno, they just feel akward to play with. In my opinion what makes a good platformer is it's controls. When a platformer has controls that make the game feel harder than it really is then in my personal opinion it's not really a good platformer... On the plus side the price tag for this game is only $2 so if you still think you want to give this game a try feel free to, it's not like you will lose out on much money!			"

												Innovative, but just not very fun.  While the central mechanic has potential, it's surrounded by a world built on poor design choices.  One slip-up, and you'll find yourself having to do some serious backtracking from a long fall down, or back from an arbitrary checkpoint a couple obstacles ago.  This is a game where experimentation is absolutely required to master a pretty quirky mechanic, and when the basic motivation to solve puzzles is sapped away, you're left with a game you keep closing out of and later trying to get back into.  I've been doing just that for literally years, and I'm done.The soundtrack, however, is great.  The game is not.			"

												Disclosure: Received review copyI have managed to avoid this game type before so to me the idea of using a camera to manipulate game enviroment the way it's done in Camera Obscura is new.  But it works as game pace at least now when i am nearing half-way trough the tower is quite good, relaxed even i would say. Early on you rush trough levels but then you notice those memento pictures in almost unreachable places and you wonder how to get there. Then there's the medals you get for using as little flashes as possible and time to complete a level.  These combined makes up for a pretty good base for a game where you learn new tricks to get over obstacles you could not figure out before.  Good luck getting those achievements that are awarded for getting all the gold medals. Even silver level is tough as nails to get them all.  This game is also one of thoses games where many times the solution to a problem is right in front of you but you were not thinking it right. Many 'aha' moments when your knowledge of the game increases (i have grinded the levels to get to the achievements - not quite there yet but i will get them). Game mood is quite relaxed even though this game can be a real skill requiring platformer when you get down to it. But you can just enjoy it 'as is' which is a plus.  Only thing i find bad about the game is boring color palette. Many modern platformers are like a bag of rainbow candy compared to this.  Soundtrack is decent but repetetive also.			"

												Camera Obscura is a small little indie title that I personally find equal parts charming and frustrating.  The puzzle mechanic here has a lot of potential, but the trailer is a bit misleading, as your after image moves with you for a second or so, then it stops, giving you lots of flexibility, but it can also be infuriating later on when you need finesse.I like Camera Obscura.  The art style has a great deal of charm even if, in my opinion, the animation is a bit choppy here and there.  The story, hidden in the collectibles, is pretty moving and sad, equal parts a character study of our heroine and a look at the cult that built a tower to the sun.  The gameplay is surprisingly devious, to the point where it can get frustrating or be really innovative, depending.  I have spent some time yelling at my computer screen, but generally, it is pretty enjoyable.Controls are fluid, but I HIGHLY recommend a usb controller, just for the difficult platforming sections.  The music is far and away the best part of the game, equal parts mysterious, calming, hectic, and adventerous.  This soundtrack is truly awesome.The collectibles and the secret endings can be a bit frustrating as there are no guides to help with them, as of this posting, and the answers are seldom ever clear.  I got two of the three endings with a lot of experimentation.I do recommend the game.  It's charming and fun, with a game mechanic that you will have to be really inventive with to use to the fullest.  As far as platformers go, it can be a bit frustrating, but as far as puzzlers go, it's deviously clever.Camera Obscura.  Worth a playthrough, I think.			"

												There's no doubt that retro-style games are making a comeback. Casual gamers like the simplicity, core gamers love the novelty, and both groups appreciate the low price. Camera Obscura is a side-scrolling puzzle/platformer from Anteater Games that could have easily been made in the '90s, but it still provides an interesting challenge that will appeal to modern gamers.Camera obscura, which is Latin for “dark chamber,"" is both an accurate description of early box cameras and also a metaphor for the gloomy tower in which the game takes place. As the story begins, you take control of an unnamed protagonist armed only with a magical camera that can manipulate the environment. The protagonist enters a giant, mysterious tower that stretches far into the sky and proceeds to ascend to the top. It's unknown why the tower exists and why it was abandoned, but you can uncover the secrets by finding pictures scattered throughout the environment.At its core, Camera Obscura is a very challenging platformer that requires pixel-perfect precision in both movement and jumps. Since the protagonist moves at a jogging pace, it's easy to fall off small platforms to your doom or mistime jumps. Fortunately, there's an endless supply of lives, and you usually respawn close to where you died. Additional challenge is provided by enemies like deadly slime creatures and flying bats that instantly kill players when they're touched. When you add the Afterimage mechanic to the mix, the resulting difficulty may have you cursing your screen so much that neighbors will wonder if you have Tourette Syndrome.One button press is all it takes to initiate the innovative Afterimage flash effect that clones the environment for a few seconds. When this occurs, the player can move to the side or jump up or down to move the Afterimage in the same direction. This process can create bridges to run on or steps to climb, freeze moving platforms, and even trap or crush enemies. It seems like a simple concept, but the Afterimage can be used in a wide variety of ways that depend on your imagination. Since the effect only lasts for a few seconds, the chance of making a mistake is greatly amplified, especially when trying to rush through a level.Speaking of which, this game has 57 maps that take place both inside and outside of the tower. Players can earn one bronze, silver, or gold medal for each map depending on the time it takes to finish a map and one medal for how many afterimage flashes they used. Replaying maps to earn gold medals helps to extend the game's length for perfectionists and anyone who desires a difficult challenge. In addition, any player can utilize the user-friendly level editor to create and upload maps to further extend the replay value. Although the retro visuals are pixelated, they still look very cool. The blocky aesthetic of the main environments remind me of Dig Dug, but with more stylish and detailed backgrounds. I also appreciate the beautiful soundtrack that puts me in a mellow mood with its cathartic melodies. It's just too bad that, just like exploring any dark room, a few bugs tarnish the experience. My biggest gripe is how customized controls reset to their default setup every time the game is launched. Other launch problems include low framerates and random crashes.Camera Obscura is definitely a niche game with simplistic gameplay, but it has a certain charm that will captivate anyone who gives it a try.

No upgrade or other skills I can use- Very punishing when dropped in climbing, has to do it all over again- Making shadow block is time wasting, I cannot instant hold the shadow block and has to wait the 3-4 sec for it to fix.- And it is really boring to remake the shadow block over and over again until it's in the right position- Not rewarding after used 20 minutes to get the Notepad typed ""photos"" collectiveVerdicts:It's a cheap priced game and only good for cards and plus one in your games library.

												Camera Obscura is a simple and self-explanatory platformer. When the game starts off, it doesn't look all that promising and ""innovative and exciting"" as the description on the store page suggests. You are supposed to jump over obstacles and reach the door to pass the level. So,  It is as simple as it sounds. But later on in the game, it gives you the ability to manipulate the enviroment by creating an after-image of the obstacles with the push of a button, allowing you to use them as a boost for a short amount of time. There aren't many other elements (which makes the game kind of dull in my opinion) and that's mostly everything about the gameplay.If you are enjoying, there is workshop support for more. Thus, taking its price into account, it offers great value in terms of replayability and lenght. There is also controller support if you have one. However, the only thing annoyed me was that, even though the graphics are old-fashionably cute, the game does not run on 16:9 ratio. (At least I couldn't make it run) All in all, it's worth it if you are platformer enthusiast. If not, you might find it a little bit dull. But for the price tag, you can't go too wrong with it.			"

												+1Controller and keyboard supportkeyboard is rebindableno mouse support (only noticeable in the menu, otherwise no mouse is desired)It's a platformer which I am terrible at but I still liked it. It has a neat concept where you can hit X (or equilevant for a controller) and the next half second a greyscale snapshot of the world will shift to what your character did. So if there is a unjumpable chasism and you hit X while running forward then you can now jump it.

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Camera Obscura with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.     I’m relatively predictable when it comes to my opinion of puzzle platformers; I don’t think they’re fun. Off the top of my head only two exceptions come to mind, the first being the Trine games, and the second being Thomas Was Alone. The key feature with both of those is that they’re more heavily story driven than their peers. Camera Obscura certainly did nothing to change my opinion of puzzle platforming, I didn’t have fun with the hour or so I spent with it, but I have to recommend it anyway.     The key mechanic is the ability to trigger a camera flash which creates an afterimage of the current visible terrain which you can then move around with your character. It’s difficult to explain on paper but the effect is really interesting. I have seen some games which allow for a certain segments of the screen to be captured and moved about but trying to work with all the visible terrain opens up many more possibilities as well as previously unconsidered challenges.I didn’t find it fun but I think it’s a well made platformer with an intriguing mechanic worthy of some attention.

												I really don't understand why this game has been given so much praise. I personally cannot recommend this game ( besides if you are looking to try out new/ different types of platformer games or if you're wanting cheap steam trading cards to level up your steam account) for the following reasons:- The 'unique' mechanic of creating temporary after-images of solid objects by flashing your camera. I find this to be interesting as i've never played a game with this sort of system before however as it's you're only skill and there's no way to boost yourself during levels or even the game game it gets dull and repetative fast. Despite the mechanic being unique and different the game doesn't really offer much else - Controls are floaty. they don't work as they should and when they do they also start to vary which becomes frustrating. Most of the difficulty comes from the fact that controls are imprecise. Making it more frustating than difficult anyway. - Puzzles are dull. By this I mean they can all be beaten in basically the exact same way which gets very boring after about half an hour or so- There is rarely any checkpoints in higher levels where the level is considerably longer, messing up on a long jump section, or killed by a slime at the end of it? Repeat from the beginning or if you misclick one of the controlls you fall through the level and usually have to start again too. - the music is average but also gets annoying after a period of time - the graphics aren't anything special, it doens't look amazing and more like a 2001 game, pretty simple and basic. 4/10  "

 Review Time!  For the TL;DR look at the bottom! Camera Obscura, an indie 2D platformer. It's cheap, odd, and a somewhat simple game. Honestly, I would think little of it and pass by it in the store page. I was very unsure at first of this game, considering how I came to aquire it. I was asked to review it, so why not? I will, I love games after all, and they are a huge portion of my life! No, seriously...The game revolves around a female protagonist with a special camera/ability to take ""afterimages"", cloning her surroundings (platform blocks) and move them for a short time to help reach other platforms. A old platform-junkies wet dream I might add. As you progress the areas to change and get progressively harder, and more of a challenge. I find it frustrating at times trying to reach them, so I know it's good for people who like challenges. It's also very casual in a sense, you can use either a controller or a mouse and keyboard which I was very comfortable with using my XBONE controller. I just sat back and played,  LIKE THE FILTHY CASUAL I AM . :)So here is one of the bad things... There is only three things you can really do when it comes to actions. Move, Ability, and Jump. That's it. I mean thats all you need but I would have like at least one more thing when it comes to controls. Add a crouch, or roll. All that really bugged me was how stale that was, but to be fair it is an indie game so... Meh. Levels were thought out well, but its a 2D game so I figure it wasn't that hard. This game honestly might get buryed considering how it is 2017 and most people are looking for bigger and better things, like graphically and with a vast, deep story. Which is a real bummer for a game like this. Considering it just wants a chance, just one. Well, that is why we reviewer  NERD  people are here. We can be here to say ""Hey, for a cheap game this wasn't half bad"" and it's not. Pick it up and try it. Cheap and simple, but hey... It's not half bad. Also! Almost forgot to say it has a level editor and achievements!Thanks for reading! TL;DR  Not bad, but not good. If you're into speed runs and old style platformers, this is for you!  "

												This game is the universal standard for ""I know what to do, I just can't do it."" There will be many times when you know EXACTLY what you need to do, you just struggle to pass because you hit the keys at slightly the wrong time.However, if you can see past the countless, frustrating attemps - failing on the same part on the same level - its actually a decent game. Unique concept of taking a photo of your surroundings, then using them to progress to the next obstacle.Would recommend getting it in a bundle sale.

												I really wanted to like this game and was excited to play it.  It is interesting when a developer tries something new.  So here we have a platform game with a puzzle mechanic.I will say for the retro style I found the art very appealing.  And I did not find the puzzles too difficult.  Sadly, I cannot recommend this game.The problem is, the developer neglected that at its heart this needed to be a platform game.  Controls are slugish, and the jumping is especially bad.  A platform game with a bad jumping mechanic is no game at all.  The puzzles become not a problem of figuring them out, but of fighting with the controls to execute on an obvious solution.  If your character had smooth controls, this would be an outstanding game.  As it is, I feel it is just below average in the platforming genre.Still, kudos to the developer for a neat idea.4/10			"

												I'm only tentatively recommending this game based on the price.As single-unique-mechanic puzzle games go, this one is completely average. The mechanic is moderately interesting. Some of the puzzles are great but there's also a lot of boring ones. Production values are bad and there's next-to-no atmosphere. There is a story but it's not interesting. There are hidden secrets, but not a ton. Medals for completing levels fast or efficiently don't feel compelling since it isn't a good test of skill.About the only thing that separates it from the standard is something they got wrong--there's no way to skip a level you're stuck on and try some other puzzles first. So if you get stuck on any puzzle you're just stuck there, which is a pretty big sin for a puzzle game.At $2 when not on sale, it's worth the price for indie puzzle-platformer fans out there, just for having a good concept and some good puzzles. But if you skip it you're not missing too much.			"

												Got this game in a bundle for cheep.The first thing I'm gonna say, might make it seem like I hate it. But I don't. I just think, it was too long.The mechanic was something that, when I first saw it, thought, 'this was gonna be an interesting game'. And it was, but it got old pretty fast. If there were maybe 30 levels of good level design and story, that would have been enough. But it's a mix of Great, OK, and poor games. You don't need OK and poor levels in any games. That is what the level editor is for. However, everything else was great and I continue to look forward to play through the rest of the game when I have time.			"

												Camera Obscura is a ""puzzle"" platformer, although the biggest gripe I have is that some of the ""puzzles"" don't feel very fair in their design, and where a simple mistake in later levels can force you to restart the whole level, like racing a slime to the end of the level, only to accidently kill it with your camera. How do you kill a slime with a camera, you ask? Simple: Using your camera (which, beyond jumping, is all you can do), you take a shadowy copy of the immediate surrounding landscape that is centered around you, and it follows you for a moment before freezing in place, which when combined with jumping and falling, can allow you to reach new heights, cross large chasms, or crush enemies between the shadowy terrain and the real terrain.While you are able to prematurely dismiss the shadowy terrain you make with your camera, you have no way to deal with the few creatures in the game if encountered in large, open areas, to which most of the levels are designed as, and several levels throw sharp spikes in difficulty at you, like trying to jump from a higher, wider ledge down to a lower, more narrow ledge that is under the wider one, or like in the example in the first paragraph, racing a slime without killing it or letting it get too far ahead of you. There are three other incentives that will also demand perfection from you with the use of your camera; Photos, Flash medals, and Time trial medals.Photos are the game's collectable and actually don't have any images on them, but rather they give details of the game's world and the protagonist's backstory, yet some of them require tricky or advanced shadowy terrain manipulation to reach. Flash medals are rewarded based on how many times you used the camera to make shadowy terrain; the fewer used, the better the medal. Time Trial medals are, well, rewarded on how fast you finish a level. Very straight forward for those. Between the three, they are ment to create replay value for the game, however the absurd increase in difficulty without proper tutorials creates frustration, especially when ingame text about your controls is spread few and far apart (which should be covered in like, say, a tutorial).All in all, if you plan to pick up the game for yourself, pick it up only when it's on sale; The frustration induced by this ""puzzle"" platformer is not welcomed.

												The developers ploy of drawing comparisons with Braid and Fez may sound lofty, but to a degree they may be justified. The game mechanic that Camera Obscura revolves around is certainly original and clever. A flash from your camera creates a semi-permanent image of your surroundings that briefly stay with you and become the extra floors and walls that you need to aid your journey through each level. The retro styling is nice, though maybe a little spartan. My main complaint is a slight lack of crispness to the movement which kept me overshooting small platforms, but that might just be my poor-quality platforming skills and is certainly not anything close to game-breaking. In all I find that I have no problem recommending Camera Obscura to anyone who likes platform puzzlers, like Braid and Fez for example.			"

												Well i'm a fan of platformers and i gotta say this one feels nice, the movement can feel clunky at times, the sprite is big so it feels a bit like a block combined with a feather, not the best feeling for a platformer but the main mechanic is well done and the atmosphere feels great, the notes you find tell the story of the protagonist and the tower as you climb up and so far they're fun to read.Overall considering the price this is a great game, easy to recommend since it's main mechanic (the photo taking) is well implemented and fun to use, it's just that sometimes it feels a bit overkill to use since, you see, the character can jump like, 1.8 meters up and all the platforms are like 1.81 meters up... this is a bit annoying and the graphic for the cave tile isn't the best in my opinion, seems like something taken out of a free tileset online (i've seen some) and for a tile SO used it's bad for it to get stale so soon.Those are minor details that bother me but the game is really fun! can't go wrong with this cheap platformer :)			"

I think I bought it for 19 cents or something.I feel like I shouldn't give this game a negative recommendation because it's exactly what it advertises: an inexpensive retro platformer based on one environment alteration ability. The platforming mechanics function similar to many flash games I've played, and like a few negative reviews, I'd concede that most of the frustration or elation comes down to how you time the jumps and block placements. Interesting for a while, but for me the gameplay was painstakingly repetitive. What's worse is that the ""Sun Tower"" could have an interesting story behind it, but the story-progressing collectibles are angsty and sophmoric, and laughably printed in the most basic of word processor fonts... Some people might dig the game, as evidenced by the majority of reviews, and when it costs a dollar or less to try it out, I mean, might as well, right?			"

												An interesting and, to my knowledge, unique core mechanic well implemented via a series of puzzle levels that slowly increase in complexity, with a fairly well-built story (for a puzzle-platformer) revealed gradually through collectable items in the levels. *Takes breath*Anything I missed?A good game, especially for the low price of 19 cents I bought it for while on sale.

												The game is so simple yet so frustrating. The timing has to be precise for many of the puzzles. Getting achievements for taking photos and killing monsters takes away some of the frustration of trying and failing time and time again. The one downside is I've stopped paying attention to the story while focusing on the puzzles. I still collect the journal photos, but I don't read them and keep going.			"

												This platformer proves that there is beauty in simplicity. With a unique mechanic of taking a 'snapshot' of your surroundings and utilizing that to solve the puzzles. It is very fun and challenging, revealing the story as you traverse the tower, with a great soundtrack as you go. As the levels escalate in difficulty you need to use everything the game teaches you- no space is wasted. Quite addicting- there is story for the readers and medals and time trials for the competitive. Definitely worth its price.			"

												So first of all, developers, don't put an achievement for opening your game, some people just want to farm Trading Cards or launch their games without ruining their achievement completion rates. On top of that, your game has 2 broken achievements, one of them is broken since 4 months, meaning I won't ever be able to 100% this game.Now onto the game itself, a simple platformer with poor controls, really buggy interaction with the environment and the character (you litterally float on slopes), and ironically enough with this games name, the camera is terrible and makes me nauseous. The music is simple and repetitive, anyways, it's fine I guess. The sound effects are poor and the game barely has any ambiance to it.There are better games out there, I don't recommend this game.

												I played this for about an hour, and it gave a pretty good first impression with its serene music, its old-school aesthetics and its unique gameplay mechanic. But unfortunately, all 3 of those aspects wear-thin as the you you play, and it starts to feel a bit monotonous: The music loop seldom ever changes; the tilesets, more-or-less, always look and feel exactly the same; and while the ""snapshot"" mechanic is interesting, it's the *only* mechanic - and it kinda gets old after a while.The game also did introduce some new things as I went along, like using enemies to trigger switches, un-snapshottable walls, and green walls that ate-away my snapshots, but the experience still felt exactly the same even as these things were introduced. And then, eventually, a feeling of monotony just took me over, and I had a distinct urge to just quit playing.I can't say I had a bad experience at all: It had a few clever levels (and a few bad ones), the music & graphics were pleasing, and I enjoyed going after time/snapshot medals on some of the levels. But as I write this review, I find it difficult to find motivation to ever launch this game again.Guess I can't complain since it was only $0.27.			"

												Camera Obscura. I got it for a cheap discount, enough to warrant resale through trading cards.There's a few things I don't like about this game- it's a speedrunner game, it expects you to beat it quickly, with as few motions as possible. And while I'm not against this genre of gameplay, I don't like it here.Then there's the game mechanic. It's pretty original, and while it IS tricky to understand, you get it with enough practice. (Although I admit there's parts to it I still don't get)But, the biggest thing overall that makes me not want to play this game is the game's movement mechanics. If the 'shutter' ability worked at the apex of my jump, I'd find it ideal. But more than that is the character's 'skidding' effect the game has (for some unknown reason) kept in. In a platformer game, your character should not move after you release the button. It really shouldn't.I really can't recommend this game. Just make sure that if you play it, you're willing to go through it multiple times, and that you have the patience to take it all in.			"

												This game is a pretty good platformer game.The main mechanic of cloning the immediate sorroundings and making them follow you for a short while and afterwards they serve as a new set of place you can jump and run around vastly changes the way you see your challenges and really define this game.I must admit that most of the game's platforms aren't very interesting enough without the ""snapshots"" you take of them which is a little bad, but it doesn't take much from it's end value.The music is pretty good and calm, the difficulty progression is also pretty good, you know what is up before you are engaged in some challenges.One thing that bothered me a little was that the ""snapshot"" moves slower than you horizontally(you can even clearly see it on the gameplay video on it's steam page), it might have been on purpose and if it wasn't they ajusted the scenarios to fit this detail, but in the end it gives some personality to the prime mechanic, which is pretty cool actually.There is also a backstory to everything, that you pick up on messages you pick up as the game progresses, I can't say more about it beacause I don't know everything on the subject, but it seems at least decent, there is definetly a mysterious tone about it.All in all I think the game is pretty great, specially if you enjoy platformers with a twist.I recommend it.

												Camera Obscura is a cute little indie game that I admittedly had not had high expectations for.  Whenever you get a game for a quarter, you can't ever be sure of the quality. But I will say I was pleasantly surprised. CO is a puzzle platformer that plays in the vein of games like Braid. It's only controls are jumping, movement, peeking your field of view ahead, and it's key mechanic: the ability to take pictures of the landscape, and as it ""develops"", it creates additional platforms to jump across. The soundtrack is soothing, the graphics are cutesy, if a bit uninspiring, and the story plays out in collectible pickups. The ambiguity of what's happening at first again strikes of Braid. For this innovative mechanic alone, the game accomplishes a very tight level of game design. The difficulty curve is structured around gradually inputing more challenges that stretch your ability to use the mechanic in new and creative ways. A good puzzle platformer like Camera Obscura has very simple mechanics that extrapolate in complexity as the game goes on.The game is not without its faults, however. The difficulty in the last few levels ramps up considerably, and the final level is excruitaitingly frustrating because of checkpoint drought. There are a few puzzles where you have to guide little mobs to hit switches for you, and it's possible for them to die and not respawn, so the puzzle becomes unsolvable until you die, at which point, you revert to the last checkpoint, and possibly, the beginning of the level. Another point of frustration is moving or timed levels, where you have to snap a pic at just the right time; a millisecond too slow or fast means starting the level over again.All in all though, Camera Obscura is a solid game with a good bit of replay value. The level design is solid and the expanding complexity of the one simple mechanic is textbook game design. Camera Obscura is no gaming titan, but it is worth your time.			"

												Can I shower this game in enough praise? No? Well, let me try anyway.This game can both appeal to puzzle and platforming gamers alike. It brings an incredibly unique gimmick to the table- after-image platforms. One may think that these would make the game easier- however, they don't. Rather, they are a key mechanic in the puzzle aspect of the game.  One must think carefully, and move quickly, as these things can only be manipulated for a short time before they freeze. This gives the game a good flow, and the feeling of completing a puzzle is astoundingly positive.  From what short time I've spent with the game, the puzzles are fun and intuitive, the mechanic is unique and refreshing, the story is simple, yet spurs a sense of curiosity, and the new puzzle elements are introduced smoothly. While this isn't the next Fez, this game certainly has potential to become one of the best indie platformers out there. 10/10, definitely a good buy.			"

												A simple game with a simple idea and a fairly simple execution. As per required in the independent landscape, this particular ""platformer with a twist"" lets you create temporary platforms that move with you when you use your camera, hence the title. It's not a bad gimmick in the slightest, but one that I never felt was fully realized during my playthrough. While some of the level layouts were fairly interesting, the only times I ever found myself stuck was when I overthought a problem. Sometimes that can be effective, but there is a difference between intellegent misdirection and mediocre level design. To be fair, there are a few sections that did have a couple of ""aha!"" moments, but even though the platforming was inoffensive most times, I can't emphasize enough the missed potential here. CO shines at its brightest when the levels themselves are puzzles, and its a shame to see that the majority of the game consists mostly of cheap filler. With more control over the afterimage effects, or maybe some sort of metroidvania skill ups for the camera to add new abilities within the fiction, I feel that while the game offered here is decent enough, there is little to engage the player all the way to the end. That is the real tragedy. So why the Yes? Two simple reasons; for all my criticisms, this is still a damn fine game. While I'd be strained to compare it to Braid or games of that nature, CO still pulses with charm that echoes ambition I haven't seen a fairly long time on this storefront. The platforming is a little stiff, but for the cheap price I keep seeing it for, I think it's a great little gem to kill some time with. The second reason is a bit more pretentious of me; Camera Obscura screams of potential, and I would love to see where this concept and its creator go from here. We all have to start somewhere, and as Anteater's first game on Steam I can't help but appreciate an inspired idea, flawed as it may be. For less than a gumball from a gumball machine, I think this game is absolutely worth giving a look. The lovely ambient soundtrack is worth the admission price alone. Definitely worth grabbing when on sale.			"

												Camera Obscura is a fun little side scrolling game with a twist.You have to use your camera to take photos that turn into after images that move with you and you use them to fill in the gaps that you need to reach the platform thats to far to jump. I have not seen this feature befor and i welcome the freshness it delivers to the side scroller genreIt dose delvier a little back story. it also hasphotos to collect  to add replayabilityyou also have to beat times and use the least amounts of flashes used to complete each stage to gain medals.not only this it has a lot of workshop content, you can create your own using its very simple level editor.So give it ago and make your own levelsThe controlls are good  for 360 controller and keyboard. ( yes i did try the controller as you cant give a good review on controlls with out trying them so shhh calm down any angry master race pc gammer out there thats reading this rember its why pcs are better then consols we have diversaty to choose how we play. ) But i do find it a bit pointless having the z button for jump aswell as the up arrowThe down side is the price :(  as i personaly wouldnt buy a game like this for £3.99 but i got it in the sale for 15pbut you still do get alot for your money.This game brings me back to a time when games were simple and fun.So my verdict is....I would highly recomend this game to anyone who loves mario or some one who like puzzles.9.5/10 for its replayabilty, origniality and how fun it is  I hope this review helps :)			"

												An absurdly cheap platformer with the gimmick that you can take a snap shot of the terrain that will follow your character allowing you to create new, temporary terrain to advance.I did not make it particularly far as it can get pretty tedious getting terrain into just the right position, even more so once enemies become involved. It's also quite ugly.Then again it is cheap and a neat gimmick so if you've run out of platformers why not?			"

												I can't, in all good consciousness, recommend Camera Obscura. The tl;dr is below.-Repetitive gameplay-Repetitive music-Stiff art-Uninspired gameplay conceptFor a long time I've joked that to love indie games you must love 2D puzzle platformers. I have nothing wrong with the genre in theory, but there's been both a glut of puzzle platformers and little to distinguish them.The only thing that seems to set any of these games apart is their core concept, which is some supposedly inspired means of getting a new grip on the environment around you, like learning to think with Portals or the time you realized how the door puzzles worked in Braid.I have too many of these games who set their core puzzle premise so front and center that it's the only thing the game can be judged by. To name a few:-Closure-Out There Somewhere-FEZ-NightSky-Offspring Fling!-Snapshot-TrineBut frankly, there could be a million more but their quantity isn't the problem. It's that puzzles are a strange thing to stick to when testing new game mechanics and have to rely on both the cleverness of the puzzle itself and whether it's fun to solve.There are ways to make a game lean on more than just those qualities. Great art, engaging storyline, rich music, but too many indie games figure out something unique (though Camera Obscura isn't necessarily unique) and decide that its uniqueness is the quality by which it chooses to be judged.Camera Obscura has floaty, annoying controls, dull music, amateur art and story in the form of cryptic, over-wrought messages, so it was pretty boring overall.I don't mean to be mean, but I genuinely wish that indie developers would choose to be unique with more than just their puzzle mechanics and Camera Obscura doesn't even really do that very well.

												Death sends you back to the start of the stage sometimes, and doesn't at other times. There's no indication of how it'll end up. I wouldn't mind it so much, but sometimes the game requires waiting for something (moving platform, an enemy), and they all move really slowly, so if you start from the beginning you need to spend a good amount of time on either nothing or an easy section before you get to the part that killed you the last four or five times. I found that the massive delay between each attempt rendered the game unplayable for me.			"

												First of all, from the description:""The most innovative and exciting platformer since Fez.""It's not. Not by a long shot. The camera jerks around constantly. Everytime you stop moving, it shifts a little to the left. It's incredibly distracting. There are buttons for moving the camera, but they're in awkard spots on the keyboard and using them feels horrible because of the way the camera moves.The hitboxes are weird. I found myself hitting my head on thin air, or glitching out trying to move throgh a passageway. And this happens often. About every 30 seconds often.The main interesting mechanic is really badly explained and frustrating to use. You have no control or indication of when the ghost floor is going to move/vanish. This makes using it a painful routine of trial and error. You can only really figure out how to use it from watching the trailer, as the game doesn't even hint as to how you are supposed to.The story is given to you through polariod camera printouts of white arial text on a black background. Also, the images are tilted at an odd anlge but the text is not, which makes it look like they're literally just rendeiring textboxes, with the default font, on a pixel art image of a camera printout. This didn't bother me much because the story is terrible anyway.The one thing I don't have a complaint about is the art and the music. Somehow, even though the rest of it is a complete flop, the music and art is half decent. Half decent. I didn't say it was good, just not horrendous.Just... don't waste your time.			"

 Summary: Surprising that the game can be gotten on the cheap with sales such as 24 cents, because the game's unique camera aspect actually works rather well. The idea being that you take a snapshot of the world, and you have a couple of seconds to walk and manipulate your snapshot in it. The mechanic is simple, but it works: it actually leads to some interesting puzzle solutions, and while the game isn't the greatest of lookers and definitely has flaws, it does feel rather different then many platformers out there. I picked it up at 24 cents, and I have to say, I definitely got my money's worth even an hour into it, and I seemingly still have a significant bit to go. Definitely worth the pocket change.

			It's really really cheap right now. And you should pick it up, because the unique concept of the game plays pretty well overall.		

Lists:+: Unique mechanic is different from other games and actually works out rather well: makes the game stand out a bit. Environments play well into different “areas” and introduction of new mechanics are done rather well.  Creativity is rewarded here with using momentum, leading to interesting solutions. In particular, being able to get rid of enemies with it is rather neat.  There's collectables in interesting places to keep you looking for things. Do like the animation of death, even if it's completely over the top at times. It's hilarious.-: Visuals are definitely lacking. It's not the greatest of produced in terms of art direction. Once in a while, the controls will feel a bit floaty.  First set of levels are definitely on the low difficulty section, but after the first section, it definitely opens up. Some inconsistent rule sets. Now note, when it's inconsistent, I'll give them the fact that it's inconsistent where it “has” to be, aka the only way to do it. "

												I haven't beaten it yet but I had to cheat to get where I am at.By giving the developers $0.25 I cheated them [sale]. But it's a beautiful game, really good. Unique mechanics, art, character and a story is drip-fed so things aren't thrown off balance to distract you from enjoying gameplay.It even has a level editor and all that. If you have the money, buy it now but then gift it at full price or something. The game deserves way more than me selling a few trading cards to get it. [Thanks though for the sale!]			"

												The game mechanic is very original, but I didn't enjoy how quickly the game wants you to play it.  You use your camera to replicate the platforms on the screen, and then you have a few seconds to move it before they stay there, where you can then run and jump on them.  In order to complete most levels, the part you need to jump over is not on screen yet, so you need to moving the whole game.  The ""afterimage"" only stays around for a few seconds, so it felt like I was forced to speedrun the game, not something I wanted to do when it appears to be a puzzle platformer.I think that the mechanic could definitely be used again though, because it is very original and interesting, but in my opinion, doesn't fit the speed of this game.

												Camera Obscura is an earnest, well-conceived, enjoyable game that feels like it was the first effort of a new developer (which it was). The game is a puzzle-platformer whose signature mechanic is the ability to create temporary platforms using a camera. Once they are there, the player can move for a bit before they solidify, and then jump on them before they disappear. Platformers with special mechanics tend to walk a fine line-either the mechanic makes the game too easy, or the developer overcorrects and it becomes too hard. Camera Obscura leans on the ""hard"" end of that line but doesn't cross it, and I say this as someone who, as of the time of this review, was encountering a substantial ramp-up in difficulty. I do have to repeat that the game is indeed difficult. Probably to ensure the use of the flash-platforms, the main character cannot jump very high on her own, and many stages require careful environmental management to progress (both the stage I'm currently up to and the one I just completed require you to keep a fragile enemy alive to solve a puzzle). The game just has a good ""feeling"" to it, the feeling of puzzle completion, the excellent soundtrack (which in my opinion is reason enough to buy the game by itself), and the sense of being seemingly stuck but knowing there just has to be a way out (which is what the difficulty entails).However, the game also has some of the weaknesses one would expect from new developers. The flash-platform mechanic is imperfect and works a lot better in horizontal movement than in vertical ones, and making the right platform is often not a matter of ingenious puzzle-solving, but pure trial-and-error. The soundtrack and setting of the game imply a slower, contemplative atmosphere, but the frequent need for fast reflexes often contradicts it. Also, though not the fault of the developers themselves, the obscurity (no pun intended) of the game means there's little outside documentation. This, combined with the difficulty, means that a player may be forced to ask around should they be stuck (as I was)The relative weakness of the main character without the camera and the fact that she slides a little too much can be a little annoying. Finally, without spoiling anything, the game has more of a plot than it actually needs, and said plot isn't the best-written (although it's a very small part of the game).In spite of these, Camera Obscura is a worthy puzzle-platformer. None of the flaws are insurmountable, and none make the game feel tiresome to play, as opposed to just difficult. I got it for sale at a very low price, but it's definitely worth buying at its regular one. While one may be annoyed at how the door to the next level is so close but so far, and struggle with making just the right platform, once they reach the door, the feeling of satisfaction is all the sweeter.

												Alright, Camera Obscura, where the hell to begin?First and foremost this game looked liked it would be interesting it looked like it would be a lot of fun, a pretty cool side-scrolling platforming puzzler. Something that I had never experienced before and something that I thought, ""hey, I can dig this"".  On the surface, Camera Obscura, had everything I was looking for in something new and exciting, and then I played it.A couple of things; you're a girl, which is awesome, I'm totally pro female protagonist. It's awesome we need more of it, but she's constantly staring at me, its kind of unnerving and a little frightening.  Why? Why are you looking at mt?  Look where your going, just look where you're going!  You're animating your sprite, which is awesome, just turn her head, just turn her head. She's always looking at you, judging you! ""Why did you jump then? Why didn't you jump before? Huh? Oh, so that's how you're playing.  I'll remember that.""Camera Obscura's camera mechanic, what do you call this mechanic? I don't know but I love it.  I love the idea of it and everything that can be done with it.  It just needs a better game to better realize its potential, I see great things for this.  Remember Narbacular Drop?  It was an okay game, not a great game but a okay game with a great mechanic in need of a great game, Portal became its great game.  Camera Obscura is like that game, it has a great mechanic in need of a great game.Camera Obscura, its a fun title.  The music was, a little repetitive, really repetitive, like super repetitive. It felt like a ten second clip looped ad infinitum.  It was... the music needed a lot of work, I'm not gonna lie.Verdict?  Well if you want a challenge give it a go.  I may never touch it again, but then I really love the camera capture, so maybe I will.  I haven't a clue.Go live you're own life and stop listening to me!

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Puzzle  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a music volue slidebar available.You can toggle the Rumble.Which means you are able to play with a controller!You can toggle between fullscreen mode or windowed mode.All resolution sizes are available.You are able to customize the controls on the keyboard.About the game.You can temporary lock the screen into some ""camera mode"" which you could use to move around to create a pathing. During thescreen lock. You will have 3 seconds to move the ground before they get frozen and you are able to stand on the frozen photoshot ground. This will not last long so you might have to act fast before it vanish. You are able to scroll abit ahead with your camera. There are enemies around, but there are not alot of them. 1 hit and you are dead, You do can kill them with the ""camera mode"". The music is also in an ""old game theme"". but it has weird loopings. like a second stop then the music restart.Game is more puzzle based though.The levels are quite short and they are like 10 in 1 chapter.There are some checkpoints in levels but they won't tell you.You play in a platform 2D, 16 bit graphic game.There are photo's around the levels, which will tell you more about the story.Tutorial/help comes pretty late and you could miss some of these ""collectables"".Other things.There are ""medals""... like someone who give a damn about those things.. it's about ""fast time"" and ""least camera mode "" usages..The game feels really bland/empty. like in every level. so i don't really think replayability is high. not for me at least.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10			"

This side scrolling platformer game is a puzzler of a puzzle game for sure. Use timed jumps and a camera ability to flash clone ur surroundings  to get therough the lvs and navigate through all the perilous ruins. This game has a pretty good smooth play, but can be a challange to master the camera flash. Also as a part of steam there is acheivments and a lv editor ! For those that enjoy making the game harder for yourselves or some one else. A nice old school puzzle game that reminds me of pitfall.			"

												While interesting concept i just couldnt enjoy it and when that 1st level requires 0:8 for gold and all attempts i did clock at 0:8:10+ it get frustrating. Especially if its the 1st level. One of the strong point is the price and if you looking for a platformer you may like it but i can't recomended. And dont get fooled by the ""The most innovative and exciting platformer since Fez."" No way close to the feeling that Fez had. Nonetheless i will not refund it cause 0,24E it is worth for my 30 min being occupied.			"

												Despite some flaws, Camera Obscura is a pretty strong platformer, with a fun mechanic that lets you play in all kinds of ways. Looking at some other reviews, I have to say I didn't find the game too difficult or ""broken"" (although I will admit there are spots where you can use the camera to create shortcuts), and honestly didn't have much trouble with controls. Really, I think this is a good game.For some more reasons why I think this, check out my full review at https://shellgamesblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/camera-obscura-review/ "

												1 Hour Alone into this game and I love it.  Pros   - Unique Playstyle     -Collectibles which explain the story of the protagonist.   - A game in which no level is he same....Giving the player a constant level of challenge.   Cons   - At times the Flash is a bit sluggish, and movement is somewhat impaired.     -Quick Time movements are sometimes hazardous to your goals.   Overall       This game is a Must Have For The Right Price.  Also Check Out The Soundtrack!			"

I was pretty excited at first because I liked the sprites and backgrounds but everything other than that wasn't good. The 'negatives' make everything look sloppy, the developer should have done something like a single platform rather than the whole screen layout. This would have made for more interesting puzzles. Also maybe some enemies and a means of defense would also make this more fun. I like the art and the plot idea a lot but the game is not fun in any way.			"

												It's a very interesting take on the 2D platformer, where you use a camera to essentially craft new platforms temporarily to bridge gaps or to make a jump you just can't reach. The fact that there's a Workshop for this game infinitely inscreases replayability (that is, as long as people keep making levels for it using the built-in editor). My only gripe is that this game isn't in 16:9 aspect ration; you're stuck with 4:3. Overall though, it's a solid game that's well worth the 5 dollars (or, as I paid for it in a sale, 20 freaking cents) the devs are charging.			"

Inconsistent pixely graphics: Either more assets and care would have been better or even a reduction to a more simple style. Its a not too pretty compromise.The mechanics: Doing too much early on, too little to keep motivation up.A smoother introduction would have been way better.Verdict:2,5 blocky Hearts out of 5 adorn the right upper screenA decent game for genre fans.Others doublejump straight over it			"

												Camera Obscura Review - Raymond KTCamera Obscura is definitely a niche game with simplistic gameplay, but it has a certain charm that will captivate anyone who gives it a try. Maybe I just don't enjoy platformers, but after playing for a little bit, nothing about this game really made me want to keep playing. It wasn't bad, just forgettable. Others may like it more than I do, but I wouldn't recommend it. I really wanted to like this game, but I can't play it anymore. It could be that I suck hard-core with games like this, but then again, maybe this game is for someone else. Probably not the average player though.			"

												Levels are awful, cookie-cutter affairs with zero imagination.The game is basically the most primitive platformer with nothing to do other than left, right jump and the camera button which creates a physical copy of the landscape a few seconds after pressing, allowing you to reach higher areas or avoid dangers.Graphics, text, presentation, everything seems below par.Even the screen fade-out on death takes WAY too long.I dunno, some games you just take a dislike to.Not recommended.

This is kinda a puzzle game, you can create after image to beat harder levels. I like the idea of it but I don't recommend it for one reason. It doesn't save. I don't know if it's just me, but whenever I shut down the game and open it up again, I need to restart all levels from beginning. Pros +Great idea+Gets challenging+Good music Cons -Doesn't save (At least for me) Overal I would recommend this game if it would save, but I don't because of it. I rate it  5/10  "

												Pretty indifferent about it, but more to the Yes side.It's a platform game that at times requires timing of jumps or to take a picture to slightly alter the map temporary in order to clear the level. It can test your patience on some levels, especially levels you're trying to get a double gold. Some levels have hidden checkpoints but not always. So far there is one level that does require you be nearly 100% precise as possible to get gold for time: Cleric's Bridge. Thankfully there is a video that can show you what to do, but be difficult to execute yourself.Sadly there's not many guides to help you out of how to clear many levels quickly or with fewer flashes. There is a guide that shows you what time and flashes you need to make minimum to get gold for each.This is a pretty good precise platformer. Easy to understand the controls, hard to master. Do expect to fail a lot in one level alone as you go farther in.You do need a lot of patience though. If you lack patience I wouldn't get this game, it'll frustrate you. More so to get double gold in every level.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.			"

												Prep30 mCook1 hReady In7 h 30 mPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.If you accidentally used poop as every ingredient in this recipe, it still wouldn't be as bad as this game. I got it as part of a bundle of games and they were all sorta fun except this one. This game is absolute trash, the only reason I have any time on it is for AFK running it to get the cards. They should pay you to get this game, or better, give you this cheesecake.			"

												Totally lost interest - just not my kind of game. It's a puzzle platformer that has one mechanic - take a picture and the platforms will move for  a short while, then be walkable a short while after that. Feels a bit samey, the game is set up for speed running which isn't my thing. Overall good mechanics and difficult to master puzzles, just not for me.			"

												In Camera Obscura you play a photographer scaling a decaying tower. Your camera has the strange ability to create after images of various platforms. These after images start off being able to slowly move based off your own movements but will eventually freeze up.Once you learn to use the After Images this game becomes a lot easier and has a lot more variety in its puzzle solving.Some of the puzzles are a little bit too frustrating. The game will sometimes task you with getting an enemy to a button to flip a door open, this enemy can easily be killed if you're not careful. These missions are some of the most frustrating missions ever. The game is hard and sometimes unfair, however it is mostly enjoyable except for one thing, the level 8-2. This level is just awful, it's unclear what they want you to do and the flow is just horrible. The fact that every guide I found online was about ways to skip half of the level, should show you how hated it is. If you make it that far I suggest you learn how to skip it as well, it's not worth the effort doing it the way the designers wanted it done.Thankfully the last level is fairly easy but has beautiful back grounds and a great musical score. It really does feel like the climax to your journey and is a great last level.On the artistic side I found the back grounds to be pretty good. Some of them even are breath taking. While the sprite work is just average. The monsters don't seem to fit with the main characters art design, instead looking like your standard run of the mill monsters. It's a shame they couldn't come up with something more intresting than, slime, bat, bug. Though the ant eater is a bit different ( though they are Anteater games ). However the true failure in this game, is the sprite animation. Slimes mysteriously grow butts, the main character jumps by just clapping her feet together. Your death animation is a silly double spin. The games animation is just a bit janky, nothing that upsets me, it just makes the game feel a bit cheap. ( Though the death animation IS hilarious ). However it does have artistic flourishes like having several idle animations that are pretty good, and even animating the scarf when she falls.The story is given to you in bits and pieces, scattered across the levels in collectable polaroids. I collected them where I could and got above 75% of them, however I wish they didn't just use the polaroids. For example in Thomas was Alone, they had a voice over that gave you bits of the story and characterization. I would have liked something similar, maybe just text appearing as you played the level. In the last level they have dialouge, but when you get to the end all you get is a samll image in the end credits. All in all I think this game isn't the best game, but it has intresting mechanics and some fun levels with a story that is a bit charming. So for the price tag I say it's worth it to play, at least up till 8-2. TLDR: It's 1.99 you get what you pay for. It's enjoyable for the most part but some levels will have you tearing out your hair.			"

												So, one day someone says 'I want to make a videogame'. They put on their thinking cap, gather their resources, and tediously come up with a plan-of-attack. Everyone is sitting around the boardroom, spit-balling ideas, and someone says:'Hey I got it - lets make one-trick-pony platformer with PS1 graphics! We will use the exact same mechanic as in Snapshot and essentially only use two buttons with looping ambient music. The art will be generic and so will all of the textures.'Who's in?---Ok, lets be serious though - its not terrible, and the puzzle gimmick is not half-bad either, but it is not something I would tell a friend to spend five bucks on, period. It is more like a proof-of-concept with placeholder art and music, at this point.  If I had to guess, this was made with some easy access video game making software, and very few of the resources are custom for this game. I see people on the forums enjoy speedrunning this, and I guess I get that. I love video games, and I love to play lots of them, but everybody is limited by time - why play sub-standard titles? I don't mean this as an insult, but it has to be said.I was gifted this game from a Steam account that regularly sends me titles to review. Thats fine, except most of what they send is garbage, which now has inflated review scores because they gift out so many copies. It irritates me a bit, to be honest.Thanks for listening.			"

												Very nice graphics, and very cool, soft music and the most important, this camera flash idea is very cool! I respect the developers, and their work.But on the other side, after playing the game for at least twenty minutes, I felt like someone who looks for a graveyard entrance to finally begin a funeral - somewhere inside the ruins of a tower. After those 'cute' droplet-things came on the next levels, they gave me the idea to use bad language for another twenty minutes. Maybe I'm not a patient person, but until I gave up this game, nothing happened. I jumped, ""flash"", jump, avoid droplets, same-same-same-same tower-ruin tilesets. Everytime the same. And the photos. It would be better to collect keys and other things like health during the levels, but nothing just photos. Every single photo-text contains the word ""she"" at least 23 times. I played the game about 40 minutes, and at the last levels I played, I realized that the main character is a girl. I said: WHAAT!?!? :D :D Looks like a boy character. Oh, and that spinning death animation...every time I screamed like an orc who's balls were ripped off. :D It was funny after I died twenty times.That spinning death looks like this:

I recommend the developers to not drop this game idea, but transform it to something fast paced adventure game. Faster music, futuristic or fantasy look. More(!) items, more surface area.Sorry for the critics, but I cannot play this game anymore. Why I bought it? It was in a pack. That's all. I gave it a try. Now you can throw the stones.			"

												I'm a fan of puzzle-platforming games and CamObs was recommended to me in a said genre bundle pack. Bought it and started playing it. I have mixed feelings about this game, because while it feels kind of a puzzle to figure out how to navigate through the level, it is more of just a platforming game. The game itself isn't that much of a puzzle as you just navigate the character around. If you are inclined to collect the story bits via the polaroids, then it might be slightly more of a puzzle to reach said story bits as some levels have them tucked away at niches that you might miss or don't know how to reach. Looking at the guides, it looks some a few are really hard to get and one that no one knows how to reach at this point.  To which, this leads to the game mechanic. It is interesting as you take images to extend your platform so you may reach farther than what the game is orginally designed. This is the entire basis of the game and while it is a bit dull, it is amusing to fiddle around and play with it during the game. This part of the game mechanic is to be applaud, but the camera pan mechanic to look further isn't as amazing. I'm using the steam controller and when I scroll to look ahead, it just scrolls back almost immediately. Maybe I need to configure the controller a bit more, but the scrolling ahead doesn't appear to be of much use except for to find out if jumping to that ledge yields a path or not. Then again, you can always just try jumping up there to see if there is anything without panning the camera that way. Probably, there will be a game level where mechanically, you need to simultaneously pan the camera and snap an image to extend your platform to reach the end of the level. (oh boy).Overall, the game can be fun if you enjoy platforming and learning about the storyline bit-by-bit. I would have liked more instructions on how to play the game before the game begins. That and clearer understanding of how the camera flash works instead of just trial and error to get a feel for it to understand it. Still, I'll play it in the long-term until I get bored of it.. 6/10.			"

												Camera Obscura is an okay game. It's actually quite fun, and the ""camera"" mechanic is one of a kind. However, I can't recommend this game because of one reason : The controls are extremely clumsy on keyboard. I never end up where I want to - I always miss landing on a block and I end up having to redo a large part of the level. It's quite frustrating. Still, the story is good and with a little bit of polishing maybe I will play this game again.			"

												I guess my review basically nothing because I've only played about an hour and a half. But I still think I should tell some of you my early experience.,-Pros-*Beautiful Graphics Reminiscent of 8bit but with a HD and modern flare*Smooth controls, not much jitter or chop.*Great music, very relaxing and blends wel with the game*Great price, I got it in the alliance bundle on sale for 1.49*Overall good feel--------------------------------------------------------------------Cons-*Repetitive, I feel like I'm doing the same level over and overr*Not, much varience(variance?) in block textures or shapes*Music is repetitive, literally one song*The screens and animations(walking, transition, main menu,sub menus) look a little cheap, as in, not much uniqueness.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary-I love this game so far, I think it was a great idea, and they executed it well. It's not too, too fancy, and I still think it is an amazing game for what it is. Although it could use some work, I think it is near perfect in this genre. Great job by the devs, (Also nice touch on full controller support. You are leaps and bounds ahead of 65 percent of steam already)			"

												The puzzling content of the game is pretty original and entertaining, you can have long minutes of fun playing it. The objective of the game is very simple, you have a device that create shadow reproductions of the platforms, which you can use to pass through obstacles and reach the goal, you can also collect hidden polaroid pictures with uninteresting texts telling the lore of the game.It is an interesting concept but the execution is very poor, the art feels very cheap, like the background doesn't match the character and platforms graphics, the music is pretty much repetitive and you may get tired after some time playing.It is okay, grab it if you see it on sale.

												I wanted to like this game.I really did.I saw the reviews and thought that it would be a solid game. Frankly, I'm unimpressed. The game consists of basic platforming aspects (that don't feel very good), along with one extra aspect, which is taking pictures of the surroundings and moves them with you.I love the publishers who made this game- they made great games like Out There Somewhere, which is a fantastic game in my opinion. This game failed to really catch my attention.The combat is annoying (Trying to crush the monsters which get caught on the afterimages and end up killing you anyways? Sounds like a fun time), which of course leads to entire levels being annoying when they require a ton of combat. Also, there are very little checkpoints in some levels, generally being the levels which really need them.Now, looking at this game from a completionist point of view: if you plan to get this game for completionist, I beg you to reconsider. The achievements are ridiculous. You have to get a gold ranking on every sub-stage in the game. Every. Single. One. It's simply tedious. There's no rewarding aspect to it.Frankly, I can't recommend this game. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't fun. It was infuriating and I was just disappointed, especially after the developers created some really high-quality games that I loved. This game, in my opinion, is a no-go. Not really even worth it on sale. Yes, it has trading cards, but those really aren't worth it.			"

												8/10I honestly struggled to rate this game. It is an absolutely beautiful and amazing 2D puzzle platformer and it is quite immersive. The concept behind the core ability to solve the puzzles is absolutely genius and well executed. Good soundtrack and great visuals. I honestly think that my biggest concern and/or issue with the game would be that while early on in the game you are given freedom to experiment and solve puzzles in multiple ways, as you press on it becomes more ""there is only one way to solve this, good luck"" oriented. I personally loved this game, beginning to end. I only wish the game had retained the felxibility that helped make it unique at the start, which was ""Move the blocks how you want"" as opposed to ""Watch your timing of these moving blocks.""			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Camera Obscura. A puzzle game that has a simple mechanic but still has challenging puzzles. The timing on some of the platforming can be frustrating at times and where the checkpoints have been placed can be discouraging when you fail repeatedly on a level and you realise how far back you've gone, but completing each level is very satisfying. It's a puzzle game where you aren't told how the mechanic works exactly but you can perform a bunch of different tricks by experimenting with it.			"

												     This is a Braid-esque platformer in that it relies around a novel mechanic and pretension to artistic statement. The story is hinted at and implied through collectible photo icons that contain snippets of text. Some are descriptions of a religious cult and some are mopey rememberences of a lost love. None are very captivating.     The gameplay is really good, though. The player can use a camera to clone certain parts of the scenery to create new platforms and solve jumping puzzles. That sounds strange, but it's a very intuitive and original mechanic. The difficulty scales gradually over the course of a robust 50 or 60 levels and many of the later ones especially are challenging and well-designed.     This is not a very polished game. The graphics are remarkably bad, although they are strikingly similar to some of the worst graphics from the 1990's -- a decade this game pays clear homage to. Is this some high-concept intentional design choice? If it is, it's too subtle for a philistine like me. All I can say is that many of the assests look like they were created at the wrong resolution and then stretched to the proper size at the last minute. Also there is a common ""bat"" enemy that looks like it was drawn by a child. The music, on the other hand, is amusingly relaxing considering it is often the soundtrack to you dying over and over and over agin.     Quibbles aside, Camera Obscura is a fun, creative platformer that kept me engaged for 10 or 15 hours. It was a great deal for the 50 cents or whatever I paid for it. Recommended for sure.			"

												To those of you looking for that retro platforming experience with refreshing new challenges, this is the game for you! You are gradually introduced to an exciting game mechanic that allows you to take snapshots of the platforms around you. These snapshots appear as overlays on the screen and will travel with you for a very short time before stopping. You will then have several seconds in which these overlays will be solid, allowing you to jump to new heights and explore out-of-reach sections of the many levels you will come to explore.I cannot say much for the story in this game because I was too enthralled by the game itself to notice or even care. This is a solid game for which I'd have gladly paid $59.99 back in the day for my Sega Genesis.			"

												Platforming starts easy, fun and smart but the game doesn't have much incentive to go on. Story is weak, controls are somewhat clungy, and later levels designs turn from smart to stupid annoying, specially when the levels start to require yout to become more precise, but the controls get in your way.Also, from what I could read in the forums, there's a impossible to reach collectible that also renders one achievement to be impossible to get, just to exemplify the kind of bad level design the game get's to at later levels.

												  This is a nice platformer with a unique mechanic. You use the after image your eyes see after a camera flash to make temporary platforms you can walk on to help you progress.  There is some story in this game but I have not played far enough through the came to comment on how good it is.   The game has a level editor and uses Steam Workshop to share user created content.  It has collectables for the OCD crowd.  For the $2.00 this game cost at the time of this review, I think it's a very good bang for your buck.Graphics:  7/10The 8 bit graphics are well done and fit the feel of the game well.Sound:  7/10The sounds and music fit the game and are of good quality.Controls:  8/10The controls feel crisp and precise. Platforming came easily on an Xbox 360 Hori gamepad.  The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is that when you are moving left or right, occasionally my character wouldn't move because I was pushing up a bit. I think the left/right window should be a little wider. Otherwise the controls in this game are spot on.Gameplay:  8/10The gameplay is fairly standard issue platforming fare but with the after image mechanic it finds it's own personality. The flash can make you have to think about how to get somewhere which I found gave this game a fun advantage over plain platforming. Overall;  8/10The value you get for you $2.00 is great. It's fun, it's different and well worth playing.			"

Camera Obscura Review by jessepgrahamMy play time should tell you all you need to know. A good platformer, but like a great reviewer once said, 'Having a good game is almost the worst thing that can happen to an indie (game), because good is the opposite of great.' I tend to agree.Pro's: Solid platforming Interesting 'gimmick' Intriguing collectable notesCon's Little to no story Forgettable main character Uninspired level design Standard enemy and obstacle designAll in all, Camera Obscura is a good game, but suffers from wear around the edges with its standard design. I rate it a35jpgs out of a possible 50 jpgs.			"

												This game is... weird, and not in a good way. The concept sounds interesting, but it's far less interesting in practice. The ""puzzles"" are at best relatively uninspired; at worst they are either way too easy or they are stupidly difficult without any real challenge involved. I think that with some adjustments to the physics of this game it might have potential, but as it is it's just not interesting. I didn't finish it, so maybe the later levels are better, but you shouldn't have to play a game for more than an hour before it gets fun. Also, the ""story"" inasmuch as there is one is not interesting at all. You find these weird polaroid images that appear to be describing the game's plot (happening in the present) in past tense, and there's no explanation for who you are or why you have this weird magical camera. There's just absolutely nothing interesting about this game to get me to keep playing it.			"

												8/10I honestly struggled to rate this game. It is an absolutely beautiful and amazing 2D puzzle platformer and it is quite immersive. The concept behind the core ability to solve the puzzles is absolutely genius and well executed. Good soundtrack and great visuals. I honestly think that my biggest concern and/or issue with the game would be that while early on in the game you are given freedom to experiment and solve puzzles in multiple ways, as you press on it becomes more ""there is only one way to solve this, good luck"" oriented. I personally loved this game, beginning to end. I only wish the game had retained the felxibility that helped make it unique at the start, which was ""Move the blocks how you want"" as opposed to ""Watch your timing of these moving blocks.""			"

												     This is a Braid-esque platformer in that it relies around a novel mechanic and pretension to artistic statement. The story is hinted at and implied through collectible photo icons that contain snippets of text. Some are descriptions of a religious cult and some are mopey rememberences of a lost love. None are very captivating.     The gameplay is really good, though. The player can use a camera to clone certain parts of the scenery to create new platforms and solve jumping puzzles. That sounds strange, but it's a very intuitive and original mechanic. The difficulty scales gradually over the course of a robust 50 or 60 levels and many of the later ones especially are challenging and well-designed.     This is not a very polished game. The graphics are remarkably bad, although they are strikingly similar to some of the worst graphics from the 1990's -- a decade this game pays clear homage to. Is this some high-concept intentional design choice? If it is, it's too subtle for a philistine like me. All I can say is that many of the assests look like they were created at the wrong resolution and then stretched to the proper size at the last minute. Also there is a common ""bat"" enemy that looks like it was drawn by a child. The music, on the other hand, is amusingly relaxing considering it is often the soundtrack to you dying over and over and over agin.     Quibbles aside, Camera Obscura is a fun, creative platformer that kept me engaged for 10 or 15 hours. It was a great deal for the 50 cents or whatever I paid for it. Recommended for sure.			"

												Just a cute platformer with puzzle elements. The levels are interesting and the overall atmosphere pushes you to explore more. The main mechanic here is taking a photo of your surroundings and using the photo layer as actual platforms in-game. It`s a great mechanic ideea and it is indeed fitting for such a game, but to my  surprise it also works amazing. Fun, cute and odly atmospheric, this is actually a quite great game.			"

												To those of you looking for that retro platforming experience with refreshing new challenges, this is the game for you! You are gradually introduced to an exciting game mechanic that allows you to take snapshots of the platforms around you. These snapshots appear as overlays on the screen and will travel with you for a very short time before stopping. You will then have several seconds in which these overlays will be solid, allowing you to jump to new heights and explore out-of-reach sections of the many levels you will come to explore.I cannot say much for the story in this game because I was too enthralled by the game itself to notice or even care. This is a solid game for which I'd have gladly paid $59.99 back in the day for my Sega Genesis.			"

												I generally love sidescrollers, but this one is leaving me wanting. The art style is rather nice, and the game play method with creating platforms from after images taken via the camera is unique. I suppose the most off-putting thing for me is that the photos which you have to collect on each level to reveal the story are... Kind of boring? I admit I only got through the first two areas of the tower. Maybe the game picks up more later on. Unfortunately it's already lost my interest.I will say the music is rather relaxing and I could see this being a good game for someone wanting to just relax and solve minor puzzles of how to get to one place or another. I guess I like a few more goals in a game though.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Camera Obscura. A puzzle game that has a simple mechanic but still has challenging puzzles. The timing on some of the platforming can be frustrating at times and where the checkpoints have been placed can be discouraging when you fail repeatedly on a level and you realise how far back you've gone, but completing each level is very satisfying. It's a puzzle game where you aren't told how the mechanic works exactly but you can perform a bunch of different tricks by experimenting with it.			"

												The game was fun, its got a cute 16 bit art style (which is always a big plus for me), and it isn't overcomplicated by stacking in redundant mechanics.The controls are a little weird on mouse and keyboard, so I would recommend using some kind of external controller for playing; though its still fully playable without one. The game tells a story through collectable items and encourages the player to find them all. Some are in the direction you're moving, others are a bit out of the way and will require a bit of creativity to find them (a pretty big plus if you value exploration and finding secrets). The game has no real combat system and instead has you treat them like pieces of the puzzle you need to solve; which i feel fits the style of the game well. The atmosphere of the game is nice and matches well with the soundtrack; simplistic in a really appealing way.At the price point, I'd recommend this to basically anyone with a few bucks to spare and an appreciation for a cute little platformer.

												Cute game with a really cool concept. The afterimage function takes some getting used to until you get the timing right, but once you get a hang of that you can get through levels much more smoothly like in the trailer video.I'd estimate a total of 4 hours of playtime for the game if you play through it once. If you go back to collect the mementos to complete the story or want to speedrun the levels to get the in-game medals and steam achievements, I'd wager that could easily double your playtime. So really, even if you get the game + soundtrack at full price for 2$ there's lots of content to go around.Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a cute casual game.Sidenote: I love the idle animations. Thank you devs, they're adorable <3			"

												Really enjoyable platformer game, with a very unique gameplay style.  As an added bonus it offers achievements and you'll easily get a few hours of enjoyment playing this game.The controls are for the most part, good, but the timing of the ""camera"" can sometimes hesitate slightly and cause you to miss a jump. For the price of this game, I totally recommend adding it to your library.			"
