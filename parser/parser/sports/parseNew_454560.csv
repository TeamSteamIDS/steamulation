								Great game, it's still early access and has some issues, but it looks good and has a great potential.			"

								This game is very rough right now, I would not buy it in the current state. Wait some days, see what the developers respond back with, and see if it improves in the future.EDIT:I will however say that I am sure the developer will work hard on this game! He already asked people what features they would like to see implemented, and has taken note.This is definitely one to look for in the future, but as of right now it needs a loving hand from the developer.

								It seemed like a dead game but suddenly we have updates :DDDDDDFor now it mostly consists of training camps and gameplanning.  At his point it isn't so intuitive but still there is plenty of reason to be optimistic.The developers have updated the game and it is beginning to take shape.  It's great to see it take shape.  Now the game planning function works, and you get offered fights(strangely with no method to compare fighters skillsets to help you plan) it is starting to show flashes of potential.  I hope fighter rankings and fight purses will appear in the next updates.			"

								People who are reviewing this game with giving It a negative review are either dumb or stupid or very selfish by putting down the developers. Early access games means that It's a work in progress. meaning not complete. When you people buy an early access title your basically helping the developers with developing the game. I would wait until a few months have gone by before giving this game a negative review. Wait until the developers have had a chance to add features and start fixing the bugs. I mean guys really stop acting like a bunch of jerks. Sure this game is not ready yet but that's what early acecess is about.			"

								When I saw you could include a large high graphical picture for your manager.  I was hoping the same type of customization were for the fighters as well.  I feel if I can customize the fighters, and create how many fighters I like both female and male.  Then also be able o customize their stats, attributes categories.  I think that alone will great add a great value to your game.  I feel with adding those critical customizations to a game like this will add another thousand players to your player base easily.  I have played managers, mangement games all my life for the last 30+ years.  I feel those key customizations will add a tremendous amount of value, and customers to your game.  I do feel your on the right track with this title just add the ability to add pictures to the fighters, and customer the new fighter stats. Thank you, continue your hard work, I can see the plus side possibility with this title,  I believe you're on to something.			"

								I would not recommend anyone to buy this game, it's still way to soon.The game is very bare-bones, with so few features that in my oppionion it shouldn't even be released on Early Access yet.On the plus side, the developer does seem quite active and interested in feedback.Check back in 6 months time....

								Going in a good direction. Lot left to do but devs have been painstakingly communicative. Regardless, treat purchasing this as more like a kickstarter that you can follow along with the progress. It is incomplete as a game but if you want a good mma gym simulator like i do, it might be worth supporting.			"

								Very simple but yet semi indepth Manager which still has a long way to go but there seems to be endless potential with this game to be a fun jump in and out MMA Gym trainer/ manager. but please remember it is still in very early alpha so dont be to harsh with judgement please, as i rather enjoy it passed its clear alpha faults.

								This game has absolutely MASSIVE potential! My first piece of advice is to WATCH THIS SPACE! My second piece of advice is to understand that this is really early access, and therefore the game is fairly barebones at the moment. Having said that, Early access gives you the opportunity to get involved in discussions and help shape the game for the developers, so my third piece of advice, buy it, play it, let the dev team know what you'd like to see and get excited for this games evolution!

								Now, this game has potential. I can tell that the developers have a good idea of what they want this game to be, but as of now, it is more than bare bones. You go in, meet some fighters that have no character or anything that will make you like them. Your fighters will win or lose, and you don't really care. And there is nowhere to go. You don't get better or worse, its just that. You can experience the entire game in about 15 minutes. BUT! This game will always be cheaper than its other competition on Steam, so I do reccoemend keeping your money now and buying it at a better price later on, once it is further developed.			"

								Well what can i say, this one was the first game ive bought here in Steam and most likely will be the last one. Cause, u know, is it a joke or something? 10 freaking bucks for 10 pictures and 8 menu tabs w/o any control of gameplay, w/o any financial, strategic, gym / w.e. reports? 10 bucks for 45 minutes of waiting for next fight w/o any chance to see it in ""record"" if u missed it for some reason? U really think its funny or what? Saying im shoked is saying nothing, u know... But im shoked even more by Steam's team unability to check what they really got on their market. Shame on u guys.			"

								Now, I've only been playing this for a short time, but I feel I had best review it while my criticism is still fresh. First things first, the game works. That being said, there are some issues constantly present.Number 1 being the lack of click acknowledgement at times, meaning that the mouse no longer can click anything, mostly happens in the fighter's ""Game Plan"" page.The back button takes you to the main menu screen, even when you are in a page where it shouldn't take you back.It works so far, and being early access, hopefully it will grow into a better game.

								This is an Early Access review. Original: April; Edit: December. Edit#2: April 2017.The developer is very active with forum feedback and suggestions so updates are promising. There is a lot to be done before this is ready to leave EA.Ultimate Fight Manager 2016 blends RT with management as you manage your own gym and fighters in a MMA world. Build your gym staff, look after training schedules and fights, hire fighters, and buy equipment. These are the options at EA launch to play around with. You can challenge your friends or others in training fights at the moment, but you can not affect any strategy changes or offer corner advice during a fight. This is on the update list.The game has an extensive update list that is free to view in the forum and I see that it could be a game title for MMA similar to how Football Manager is a popular title for sim-management football.As of 30th April 2016. I recommend this as a purchase IF you are prepared to offer feedback to the devs, and are willing to be part of the Early Access process. This isn't a complete game with all the features. This is a game with only some of the features as shown. You can enjoy some of the basics, plan fights against others online, or against the AI. This review will be added to as the game progresses through EA towards full-game launch.EDIT: December 2016.If you are interested in the game, I suggest following for at least 3months to decide if the dev commitment compels you to purchase. So far there have been updates, but the game is still far from a Beta quality.EDIT: April 2017.As of the end of March all development on the game has stopped as once again they have no development team. Stay clear of buying this game until it is launched at this point. Just a shame that we can't get refunds anymore.			"
