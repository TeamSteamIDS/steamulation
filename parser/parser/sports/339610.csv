												let me give you a proper review of the game i played it since closed beta so most of the people praising it are players who played it before steam and spend TONS of money on it and they're trying to sugercoat the game so gain more players so they can curse at you and humiliate you also call you noob.PLEASE READ IT ITS A WARNING ABOUT THE GAME.pro:-great gameplay.-costumization.-different dunks.-teamwork required.-scoring feels satisfying.cons--HEAVILY p2w (like seriously check the cards your can obtain all cards wich are gold are only obtainable through cash those cards can be upgraded more than 10 times) and don't forget the +10 stats on clothing wich is also only available for cash (with item balls) only free players can only have +5 stats on a clothing piece i calulated the stats you could earn with cash and with ingame money free players can get to +35 on 1 stat paying players can get over +65.-HIGLY toxic playerbase don't get fooled by the rookie server the pro server is swarming with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s bragging that they spend the most money in the game.-usseless gm's they ban you if you say bad stuff about the game i already had a warning message from a gm.-relies highly on ping for the pf and C position.-players posting the most dumbest things on the forums wich has nothing to do with the game its almost as bad as facebook.-pf's are highly overpowered they can shoot 3's like a sg, shoot 2's like a sf,dunk like a pf and rebound like a C and pf's has a skill that makes C's completly usseless.-C's are HIGHLY underpowered DO NOT!!!!! take that position they got almost completly usseless cause of pf's. -mostly foreigners good luck finding english players.-idiotic players who keeps wanting an asia server even tough there is 2 asain versions  of the game already.-playerbase is next to none before it came to steam and there is a good reason for that.-prepare to get kicked out alot. -special characters that is only obtainable with cash gaining special atributes.-players who have vip cannot be kicked in fact vip players can kick the host.-most events require cash-cash clothing so big it litteraly blocks your view of your character.-special characters have a bigger hitbox-tons of exploits like when you playing as a C or PF most of the time you needs to split into 2 to win and either way you get the blame.reason the game is so p2w is because its following the taiwan version of the game the korean version is 10X better and not p2w at all. if it din't have all those cons the game could have been so much better this is the REAL review of the game from a player who played it for 6-5 monthsP.S. don't listen to uncle he got the worst excuses like you don't get the timing right like ♥♥♥♥ing seriously? i jumped the same time as the opponent did get your eyes checked.and don't listen that he never paid anything because he would call it ""DONATORS"" that match proved my point more than ever.

												First time I felt the need to write a review.  This game is truly satisfying if you're a competition junky. You don't even have to like sport games to enjoy this game.  The gameplay and game mechanics all work well, untill that point where you hit level 24. As a beginner, I started out playing against other noobs and various pro players that had their smurf accounts in the rookie/major league. I had some epic losses, epic victories, various intense close point games that went into second overtime. Eventually, I managed to get to level 25 with a 76% win percentage overall, I felt like a solid player that played his role ( PF ) well. In good matches, I'd block about every shot, bad matches I'd let a few slide.   All the fun in the game stopped though when I entered the  Pro League.Match after match, you get to play against level 50 characters that not only have the most ridiculous skills that you could think, they also have so much experience that not in another 1000 matches could you hope to destroy them. They also have, in almost EVERY case, dropped over 200-300 euros on cash shop roulette style items that grant bonus stats, cards and card upgrades that grant..bonus stats, extra skill slots, etc.  You name it.So in quick summary. You might love the game in the beginning, you might think you're a genius rookie player destroying the alt characters of pros. But once you actually get to the pro league, prepare to bend over and take it, over and over again untill you yourself are level 44-50 and have unlocked all the skills + slots. Surely by that time, you would also have dropped atleast 60 euros on the game.			"

												Bear with me as this is my first game review on Steam:Pros:- Great customization (Skills, Freestyle variability, Clothing, Stat allocation)- Requires teamwork (Heavy)- Crew matches (Like GvG in MMORPGs)- Easy to pick up, Hard to masterCons:- Community can be toxic (Will explain more later)- You can pay for stats- Fluid gameplay relies heavily on latency (ping)Freestyle2 is a great Multiplayer Online 3v3 Streetball game that pleases my thirst for basketball games.It is very easy to pick up (You only use direction keys + 4 basic keys + 2 or 3 more for specific skills),but hard to master.It relies moderately on basketball knowledge, such as actual basketball tactics like Pick and Roll, which can be executed in the right situation. To win, you will have to try your best to fulfill your one of five (C, PF, SF, SG, PG) position's purpose.Positions and their roles are generalized in FreeStyle2, although adventurous stat allocation may lead to fun and creative plays (like improving 3 pointers success rate on C or PFs). C: Rebounding and blocking, setting up plays under the paintPF: Similar to C, but takes an offensive roleSF: All-rounder (Dunk, rebound, middle jumper, 3s)SG: Also an all-rounder with heavier emphasis on 3sPG: Playmaker (Passing and loose ball grabbing)Playing the position that fits you and doing it right comes with a great rewarding feeling.Also, there are many team compositions which are strong, but you will run into hell lot of weird ones online (Triple Cs)If you aren't good at what your position is supposed to be doing by Major (past level 11), you will most likely be dealt with offensive words, telling you that you suck and that you should quit.The playerbase isn't large enough to have the greatest matchmaking system and tiers - and this is why sometimes you will face teams that will totally ♥♥♥♥ on your face. Knowing your position and having individual skills is very important in this game and when a single teammate is not pulling their own weight, it shows definitely. I highly suggest trying each of the 5 positions before moving onto Major (level 11+)You can pay for extra stats (btw you can also do this for free, but not as much). Does it help? Yeah, I guess.Does it win games? Maybe - it makes minimal difference.Why is that?Let's say a player purchased items and also obtained cards to improve his 3 pointers.If you are guarding him perfectly, he won't score any 3 pointers.If you don't and give him open shots on 3s, you should really blame yourself.Teamwork (Strategy, Individual talent, knowing how each other reacts in certain situations) is much much much much holy freaking so much more important and impactful than stats.Gamekiss will be adding controller support very soon, and I am so excited for that!Give this game a try. If you like working as a team and enjoy basketball in general, you will love it!			"

												Bear in mind that this review comes from a person who used to play Freestyle 1 a lot of years ago. I've played in Thailand servers, in Gamekiss (NA) servers, in 4Game (Russian) servers and my country always had a big community in this game because we are big on basketball. There will be a lot of comparingBefore my rant, remember: I HATE BASKETBALL.Yes, I hate basketball. I've played this game for so long (the Freestyle 1 version) even though I hate basketball. You know why? Because this game is super fun even if you don't know anything about basketball. There is constant action, it's super rewarding to block, rebound and when you hit a 3-pointer, it's the best feeling ever.Freestyle 1 was actually rather bad.It was full P2W, clothes that give attributes were all costing money, the OP moves that were difficult to block were all expensive and you HAD to buy them with real life money. There were serveral exploits like when you receive a pass, you get a speedboost. Exploiting that, you could always step back faster than your opponent and make yourself unblockable. Level system was awful, you only got your real position at level 15 and the grind to 45 (max level) was like the whole game. High level people could do anything and everything so you had to block them every time because they would hit every shot. You know why that was awful? That's right, the speed boost exploit.Freestyle 2 possibly improves every mechanic that existsted in FSSB1. Skills costs like 3k at the start, meanwhile you get like 50k points at the start by registering, eliminating the grinding element of the game. Freestyles (Skills that only makes your shot/dunk different, making it harder to be blocked) can now be used only once or twice per game because you have to meet the requirements to do them. However, once you do them, it's garanteed points, so I think that's a nice touch. You choose freestyles on your own, instead of them spinning in the exact same order for the whole game. Music is constantly playing in game, making you feel in action. Also, the soundtrack makes you super pumped, while you can also configure it FSSB1 Games were all the same: PFs/Cs rebound, pass it to SGs and they shoot 3points OR PFs just dunking and you can't block them because they have paid for the awesome almost unblockable dunks. In FSSB2, or at least in early stages of FSSB2, it won't be like this. SGs can be blocked easily, there are way more rebound patterns for rebounders to learn, etc. Bigger skill variety Can be played with a controller. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it might be really fun Awesome rewarding system, making you feel progressing, most daily quests  aren't considered grinding and there are constant events. You also constantly get items and a lot of points, also making the game not P2W EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE BASKETBALL, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME It's super rewarding. I watched a streamer play it with friends in front of 13k thousand viewers yesterday and he had a blast, meanwhile not even knowing that you can't shoot while you are getting defended by someone. He still had fun, I saw the excitement in his eyes meanwhile he was watching whether  the ball will go into the basket or not.  ALSO, IT'S SUPER FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDSEven if you dislike basketball, dislike sports games like I do, you might still have a blast. It might still be super fun for you, or at least fun for 3-10 hours. You have nothing to lose, it's  free to play. Grab some friends, put your game pants and gunnars and go play it! This game is awesome and the devs definitely stepped up their game, adding new elements and improving  the old ones. "

												I started playing this because its free and I actually enjoyed it. I had like 100+ hours on it creating new accounts to earn 150k points. Bought 500 Gkash for the event.I was able to feel satisfied with how my character looks and plays. But as soon as I reach level 24. No one would play with you. If there is, they will call you NOOB throughout the whole game. Then use a microphone and harass you throughout. Community sucks! People are jerks~! There are some who would play with you but for the most part everyone is a jerk. Downfall of this game is how jerks high level people or seasoned people are and it really sets me back.Goodluck to this game. Its fun till 24 and if you like getting called noob and doesnt bother getting owned by seasoned players or getting kicked from room to room spending 15 minutes just to play 1 game then get called a noob then kicked then this game is for you.

												+ Nice game mechanics..blocking,rebounding,shooting etc feels real and timing based..+ Graphic style is decently good..+ Various challenges and daily quests- Heavy money involved..like around 50% of the game content needs you to pay real money..i haven't been too deep into the game but seen the cool chars costs like $20 per character..- Level grind is quite slow- Servers still quite troublematic..sometimes you have auto win or auto lose because someone instantly DC'edupdate:- stopped playing the game since it's DCing all the time (im using the asian server)- played against a paid character and she had like 10 consecutive 3pt's (30 points)..its quite ridiculous even in real life basketball..

												The first negative aspect is the toxicity of the game. Theyre naive enough to insult and berate a teammate for a mistake when they also make mistakes. Through levels 1-23 I genuinely enjoyed the game. But when I hit 24 and was forced to go to the next server I was annihilated. The players were 2x my speed. My sprint was slower than their jog. The way the advancement in this game is setup favors veterans whom haave already achieved level 50 and give the new players near no hope. Was fun until level 24 so if you're looking to kill some time playing this game for a week or so is a good option			"

												I've been playing Freestyle for 7 long years. Since I was 12 years old, Freestyle has been my favorite game.It has been with me throughout all my teenage years, and I don't regret a thing.Ever since it first came out in 2006 (published by Activision), the game has had issues maintaining a good population due to lack of advertising and support from the foreign developers (JCE).That's all hopefully going to change now that it has been released on Steam. It's a shame how we had to wait so many years for this because this is one of the most competitive games in the world.Everybody who plays this game strives to ultimately be the best, and it's a team game so you have to find 2 other players who share the same mindset as you and want to be the best just as bad as you are.A lot of this game consists of managing egos of not only your rivals, but your teammates also.There is only one ball in the game of basketball, and scoring is only one part of it.You have to have a good overall team that can not only score, but rebound, defend, block, steal, and pass at the right times.This game is all about customization and making your player unique. There is a big item shop in the game that allows you to buy headgear,tops,bottoms, shoes, and accesories to make your baller look unique.There are also Freestyles that allow you to change basic animations like dunks and shots so you can turn your simple one handed dunk in to a crazy 360 between the legs dunk!Then you have your skills. Skills are new animations and upgrades you unlock through leveling your character.Skills are the most important part of the game since they give really useful animations like diving for the ball or fading away.When you first start the game and you go in to Rookies, you will be playing versus new players such as yourself who are also learning the game and it will be a cake walk for those who learn faster than others.Beware though, there is a huge learning curve when you reach the big leagues (PRO Channel).People do NOT like losing in Pros because it will result in their win % going down and the person that beat you having proof of them beating you.I was never a guy to make many friends on this game, in fact I made a lot more enemies than I did friends and I am very hated but my advice to you new players is, make some friends before you reach Pros.Try your hardest to communicate and socialize, post on the forums. MAKE FRIENDS. You do not want to be that ""random"" ""unknown"" person in Pros because nobody knows you and you will be kicked out of teams that have good players when you try to join because they simply don't know you.You will be stuck on the ""Noob Treadmill"". That means you will be stuck playing only with players who are really bad and don't care who they play with, and other unknown players like you are which means you will lose A LOT and people will never see you as good.So make friends before you get to pros! Get your name out there.If you pick up this game and decide you like it and you're either a PG,PF,or C then you can add my character in game, I will help you. My IGN is: ZarrySo yeah, that is it for my long review and although my time on this game is coming to an end, I am happy it is finally getting the exposure it deserves because I know theres a kid out there right now maybe even reading this whos 12 or 13 years old that will fall in love with this game and aspire to be the very best player just like I did.Good look in the pros, newbs.

												Having played this game for quite some time this is how I feel about it:Positive:+ It's fun: Seriously, the game is really fun.+ Has a nice mixture of simplicity and complexity: The game is easy to get into, the controllers are kind of basic but it has a high skill cap, it's hard to master them.+ Character Costumization: It's really nice.+ The game has tons of features to keep you entertained: Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, Challenges, etc.+ It's rewarding to play: The achievement system combined with Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, etc. makes you feel like a winner even when you're losing, so there's some reward in actually playing the game, even if you're not that good at it and just like playing it for the sake of having fun.+ MVP: MVP rewards the player that contributes more for the team instead of the one that just scores all the time. Maybe it could be a bit more balanced, but it's nice to see the game reward team play.Ofcourse there are negative points too.Negative:- Paying actually makes you better: Or atleast makes you seem like you are. Paid characters, like Ginger, for example, WILL punish you if you make a mistake, they are deadly because of the bonus they are given. Maybe in higher levels of gameplay that becomes less noticeable, but in lower levels it's really noticeable, they barely miss. And also there are skill slots unlockable by paying, and that gives more options to people that pay to unlock them, giving them an advantage over free plays. I'll put this on capslock: THE GAME IS NOT FULLY PAY TO WIN. That's not what I'm saying here! What I'm saying is the feeling that I got, that if you're a free player and paying against a paid character in a similar player skill level it's more likeable that he will easily punish your mistakes thanks to the character he has than you are likely to punish is, since you don't have as much stats and special bonus as he has.- Matchmaking is... weird: I dont know how matchmaking works on this game, but more than a few times I got to play against players that you could see by the skills they were using that they were atleast 10 levels above the players on my team. And I also felt the reverse on some games, that I was being matched with people levels below. Most of the time it felt fine, but I think it was like 80/20, so I thought it would be worth to mention.- Menus: Menus can be a bit confusing for newer players, since they are presented with a huge BOOM of stuff.- Clarity: The game isn't very clear on some stuff. For example, I had to go google for quite a bit of time why I couldn't level any stat after putting 5 points into it and the game doesn't tell you what keys to use on your controller, so even if it supports it, it's kind of better to play on the keyboard. That kind of stuff.Overall it's a good and fun game. I recommend it, even if you don't like basketball that much, give it a shot and try to bring your friends to play it with you, only makes it more fun. I'm curious to see the game evolve, since It's kind of new, from what I've read.			"

												This is the same FreeStyle Street Basketball MMO under new management with a re-touched coat of paint and 5-10 extra ways to get you to spend money on items you don't actually want.Pros:-Fresh, vibrant artstyle-Arcade style gameplay-Decent Customization options-Well-organized lobbies ranked by skill level-Bot support-Clan supportCons:-Annoying community-Sketchy connection issues (On my first FSBB2 session, I was dropped from a game loading screen no less than 7 times in a row)-Puzzling sound direction (I don't necessarily mind the Korean rap, but the voice acting leaves a bit to be desired)-Too many unnecessary features. Booster cards, gachapon-style power-ups, robots that shout nice things and return balls for you after each shot in practice, a post-game breakdown that pats you on the back and lets you pick a mystery card: basically, every smoke-and-mirrors parlor trick mobile game designers have tried to implement into one gaudy, bedazzled cardboard box.In short: yes, I found it fun. I found it fun the last time I played the same game 5 years ago. There isn't enough improvement here for me to specifically recommend the game to any of my friends, especially not the ones who abandoned the game with me last time. I was expecting something different out of a sequel to a game that already had glaring flaws regarding netcode and connection issues, honestly. Daily Login bonuses and fake tickets for electronic roulette prizes won't cover up the few issues that still seem to exist.			"

												Real basketball fans and players wouldn't be impressed with this game's mechanics or animations because this game doesn't  go for a realistic basketball simulation. Instead this game focuses on team play and player customisation and most of customisable things are aquired by playing the game, not by spending real money. Post game rewards and leveling up keeps you playing and grinding through the game. Just remember that if you want the best experience , team up with 2 of your buddies and it will be a lot more fun and enjoyable to play :) Overall: If your looking for a realistic basketball simulation - don't bother, It's not NBA 2K, but if your looking for a fun, grindy,arcady team game - try it out.

												Pros:- easy to get into with a bit of basketball knowledge- first hours are really fun- if you get good teamplayers and go on a winning streak, it is really fun but..Cons:- ..but that nearly never happens, toxic community, lot of ego players, who only spam ""pass me the ball"" and never pass back and insult you anyway- the game supports this ego style because being open isnt as important as individual skill and outplaying your direct opponent- simple but sometimes weird acting controls (buttons have 2-3 different functions, dunk and postgame for example), different results in same spots and blocks and rebounds seem a lot like coin flips most of time, or i didn't play long enough to understand the mechanics.- lags are a huge issue, a lot of players warp around the court and score or rebound or get lose balls without the game even showing anything. it just happens.- terrible UI, lots of bugs, long loading times, the game hides a lot of information for example skills and stats of other players, which i guess is intended because..- .. massive P2W, you can buy toys, cards, skills, freestyles and clothing with bonus stats- no real matchmaking, you could get a team of 3 Cs who just afk or a perfect P2W team with a 5 game winning streak, both games are going to be no fun at all.Summary:It really has a lot of potential and could be fun, but the issues and the community are just to bad to keep playing it for longer.

												This is from the perspective of a new player - i've played a couple hours or so of FSBB2 and here's my honest review. PROS: It's essentially 3-on-3 basketball. If you love basketball as a sport and as a game, this right here is it!  Simple at the start, gets more complex as you gain levels and ""skills"". This includes player skill as well as actual skills that you buy for your character ingame.  Additionally, customization is great. Loads of costumes, the ability to pick your skills to do stunts with, as well as ""freestyle"" skills, which you can think of as EX moves which use meter in fighting games;  do enough in a match and they become available for you to use. Cards are also a part of customization, you can load up cards that help you with certain statistics. On level up, you get to distribute points to certain characteristics as well, further making your character truly unique. Positions function as classes in this game. There're primarily offensive positions and defensive positions, as well as assist positions. All of them are viable, though some are more preferred than others. This gives some distinction between characters but as mentioned in the previous point, you can make your character have strengths that are adverse to contemporary assumptions. (A 3-pt shooting center? Why not?) Personal preference, but I like the aesthetic and music. It's fitting with the style of FSBB2.CONS:Oh dear, here we go. Perhaps the most destructive aspect of the game is the community. Predominantly filled with Filipino, Thai, and Indonesian players, English fails to become the primary language in this game. The community is very exclusive in nature, and unless you're part of their culture, you'll be isolated and alienated. Furthermore, many players are extremely toxic in nature, playing the game only to win. They'll personally admonish weaker players as soon as they make a mistake, and they take absurd pride in their own abilities even though they make mistakes as well. You wanna destroy a multiplayer game? This exclusive, toxic-filled community is how your game dies.  Pay-to-win. If you're a F2P player, be prepared to lose. A lot. Unless your team has veteran players or Pay2Win players, there's absolutely a slim margin chance of you ever beating your opponent, especially if they're Pay2Play. The greatest example I can give is that basic stats become skyrocketed the moment you have buffed equipment on. These equipment buffs are equivalent to around 30ish player levels at least, and that's not including the card and pet system as well. Between players of equal skill, the one with P2P equipment will always, ALWAYS win. That's just the nature of the beast. You'll be outrebounded, out blocked, out scored (your blocks will become ineffective).  Lack of a ""skill-less"" channel. You know, the above point can be completely circumvented by the addition of one simple thing - channels that remove all additional buff stats (but lets everyone keep a set number of skills). With this, everyone can play on an equal level. People will be forced to play with others outside their circle and the community will be more accepting. The only drawback with this server is that GameKiss will fail to make any form of profit from it. Who doesn't want to be overpowered? This is a stretch - but recent games like Overwatch have added special ""swear filters"" that replace the swear words with text to bemean the aggressor. A lack of such a system here (seriously, does anyone even use the report function) allows players to be as toxic and as horrible as they want without any repercussions. To be honest, I cannot see myself even reaching level 50 in this game with the current drawbacks. As I level more, the players become more unforgiving and loathing. It's embarassing to even be associated with them and their culture - I routinely kick toxic players from my team even though they may be performing well and giving me wins.I do love this game, and I can spend HOURS practicing my skillsets on my own - it's just that as a multiplayer game, the community is absolute garbage and leaves me wanting nothing more. Food for thought: why is it that SEA communities are always incredibly idiotic and taxing to play with? Most of them are asshats and ruin the multiplayer experience for everybody. "

												Too easy. Not Addictive.  Trash community. Trash gamekiss. Trash game 6/9 would not recommend.Edit: Ok, honest review : Unless you plan on dropping a few hundred bucks on a game that doesnt even have more than a hundred players on at once, or are extremely skilled/asian/no life at games, dont pick up this game. IT will suck away your already non-existant life and make you miserable. This game is not for the weak. The skill difference between top players and beginners is like a pro player in League vs a Bronze player. With the ASTOUNDING 50 active playerbase, you will eventually get put up against players that will destroy you sooner than you know(probably 1 week into the game).  Those that cannot survive a TOXIC COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE THE BEST and insanely unbalanced games due to THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BY MOST PEOPLE SO THEY CAN BE OVERPOWERED should just leave. Backed with the fact that the company running this game wants to take your money, you will be pounded in AND out of game. Sure, the gameplay itself is fun and addictive. But still IT ISN'T WORTH IT. As a player who has achieved the PINNACLE OF FS2(becoming a major tournament champion), I would trade back these 2000 HOURS WASTED for a pack of condoms. Don't do this to yourself. Stay in school kids.2nd Edit : Forgot to mention 30% of the community hacks and gamekiss does nothing to ban/update the 2 year old hackshield. TL;DR -  FK YOU READ MY REVIEW IM A GOD.			"

												Been playing this game since release, and played way back since Freestyle 1 when Sierra own the game, still overall fun and enjoyable, don't really care much if it's pay to win, It's fun, the graphics doesn't really matter since it's cell shaded, and overall there are tons of skills to use. When it comes to BallingIsLife™ this game still deserves the award of being fun and even if you don't like sport games, this is still an enjoyable game due to the mechanics of it and animation which I find humorous. Game was my childhood and I'm still playing it.Pros: Easy to learnFun to playLots of clothes and customizationsLots of skillsToy system is interesting to play around for statsStill feels like the old free style gamesDunking on people feels amazing!TournamentsGrowing communityCons:Pay to win *Debatable*Lots of foreign people play so teamwork is hard to communicateServers are a little unbalance from level capsLots of people sliding due to the lag of the serverReasons why I say pay to win is debatable is because I have accounts that have never touched a single cent from my wallet, and overall I am still able to win games, on my main accounts I have 85% win rates on them and played over thousands of games with them, My personal opinion it really depends on your skill level and how you play the game, because when you're playing the game, you'll see that anyone can shoot and make baskets, or defend and block shots, its really how well you play with your team and how good your offense and defense is. Overall good game, I enjoy it and Its free, so play the game.			"

												I've been playing since FSB 1 back in the Sierra days... and in my honest opinion... this game is fun but the community is one of the worst I have ever seen...The game is very fun and entertaining once you get the basics down but until then it's very frustrating playing in the rookie server with people who are selfish and doesn't know the meaning of teamwork... Some people don't realize that this game actually has a pretty steep learning curve... it's not all just shoot shoot shoot...FSB 2, similar to the 1st game, has elements of P2W but I think you can hold your own, without spending money, if you are a good enough player. If you enjoy the game, I recommend learning the basics of team-play if you want to advance any further: passing, rotating, defense, etc... like i said, it's not all just shoot shoot shoot steal steal steal...About the community... this game is sadly filled with a lot of kids who talks a lot of trash and have big egos... It's like high school all over again... everyone has their own ""cliques"" that they play with and will kick anyone else out (sadly, sometimes I don't blame this type of behavior because a lot of players don't bother to learn the game correctly so they become a liability to the team, therefore leading to no one wanting to play with them). I don't suggest you visit the forums of this game, especially on the gamekiss website, it's so toxic... Overall, I like the FSB series... but the horrible community and lack of competent players/teammates can make it frustrating for newcomers... If you have friends who are willing to go through the ups/downs of the game with you, I think FSB can be very enjoyable experience...			"

												At first,when i saw the game i was like,OHMIGOD THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME I CAN'T WAIT TO DOWNLOAD THIS RIGHT NOW!Oh how wrong i was...Ok so let's start with this. This is not NBA basketball,this is street Basketball,which basically means 3v3 on one court 5 minute basketball matches,no fouls,no overtimes,no free throws. The gameplay is really fun,addictive and easy to understand,but hard to master. There are 5 classes for you to choose,plus 3 more if you want an advanced class of sorts. The game has MMORPG elements such as skills(fade away,double clutch etc)and things like tricks that can be used for doing 3pts or dunks or blocks (Twister,The Shot,etc). Plus you have a level up system,which awards with attribute points so you have better chances of doing 3pts dunks or blocks.But once you realize the faults of this game,you are better off uninstalling it.First off,the game is Pay-to-Win-ish,a F2p game for me should have at least micro-transactions for cosmetics and stuff like that,not for special characters like point guard son goku over there.Second,the game has a lot of bugs,connection issues,freezes,which need to be fix ASAP.Third,the community i say is more like CS:GO's and LOL's community long lost son who was adopted by an Asian. It's filled with ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s,12 year old's who say that they are ♥♥♥♥ing your mom,and just toxicity all around. And it dosen't help that once you leave rookie and have an unbalance between veteran players and rookies (basically think of it as a Team of LVL 12 novices vs LVL 50 veterans)Fourth. BITCOIN MINERFifth. HACKERS. I have at least spotted 3 hackers in 3 games. If this doesn't get fixed,it will be S4 League all over again.In conclusion,without the Hackers,the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community,the bugs,the Bitcoin Miner,and the skill gap when you leave rookie servers. This game would be better than an NBA game for at least 5 years due to it's potential.It's just the potential,is stuck under the river of cons i said. "

After exiting the rookie channel, Every game you play, you will face either P2W players or hackers. Maybe at peak hour you can find some normal players. I don't know p2w, but the hacks are getting out of hands and it really destoryes the gaming experience and the game company is not doing anything to punish the hackers.

The community (not all) is toxic. There's just one event I will never forget, which scarred my life.

												Here we go, I've only played one other Basketball game so I'm not a pro on basketball but I have a good felling for it. This game to be honest isn't that bad, it's a free game so you can't expect much there are a lot of micro transactions and such but other the that the gameplay isn't bad... BUT I tried installing it on my own computer recently cause I was playing it on a different account and it was pretty sketchy, I then turned to the steam reviews to see if anyone else had this problem and I found out that it contains Bitcoin Miners. I'm not 100% percent sure what BitCoin Miners are but I have a feeling they're not too good lol. Other then that the game isn't that bad for a free to play game but if you wanna stay on the safe side then don't bother with this game.			"

												It's fun for a bit and the game runs pretty well. I only experience small amounts of latency issues that really changed the tide of the match but it was rare. My true gripe with the game is the balancing as you level up, not so much the balance once you're at the top of level and have unlocked all the skills and attributes. During the first few levels on the beginner server, the game is fun but it's ruined by ball hogs and people who don't understand the sport or the game at all. I think out of 50+ Matches I had in the beginner server, very very few of the matches were competitive. Either your team stomped the other team or your team got stomped because you were paired up with people who didnt understand the fundamentals to the game (would try to do half court shots with a C, SG's would just stay under the rim for a rebound) But the games that were closer in score were actually really fun. Once you're fresh out of the beginner server, thats when the game gets even worse, you still have people who don't understand the game at all but not only that, you are matched up against people who have unlocked very strong skills that you don't have access to until you grind out several dozen matches. These skills literally make the player exponentionally overpowered compared to the skills you have when you are a fresh level 12 (Alley-Oop spam, Back Step dribble, etc.) So you have to endure through these matches because more often then not, you will be paired up with people still learning the game and have no idea how to play against teams that are already overpowered so they resort to afk exp farming. That alone is abused like heck, people just matches just to afk and get the match experience because they know they will most likely lose to higher level players. I'd love to recommend the game because it can be really fun, but it just gets worse until you get to much higher level and everyone balances out and the game becomes more skill based. But enduring the grind of the early levels coupled with players that don't understand the game and the afk farm, just ruins it all for me.			"

												Quick review for those who want to try this game.Pros:+ Decent gameplay.+ Character customization.+ Nice BGM and in-match commentary.Cons:- Bitcoin miner inside gamefiles (fixed ?).- Unrealistic physics.- Pay2win: * Special Character have 40 more attribute points than normal characters. You can either get Buzzer Beater (which have no additional passive) from reaching lvl-50, purchase from the cash shop or pray to rngesus to get it from balls (similar to gacha).* Cosmestic's stats boost which cost real money to add it permanently.* Stats boost card gacha.* Skill slots which cost real money (can get from event which occur once a year[?] )Conclusion: It's a nice game to play if you have a lot of money to spend.

This game is  heavily team-based, featuring 3v3 basketball matches that can get hectic pretty fast in the long run, especially in the pro channels.When I started out in the game, I didn't like how bad I was, and how bad my teammates were sometimes.

												UPDATE!!!!!!!!!! --- It seems someone else noticed what i wrote below. They implemented 2 new channels, of which one is for real rookies without lvl 12 char in account only. This seems very wise and good decision. Unfortunately i allready have a char above 12.....(which is ridicoulisly fast achieveable.)OLD VERSIONS CRITIC:Game mechanics and stuff others may explain. Basically theres 3 ""tiers"" ""leagues"" for competive mode, which is the main event of this game, allthough you can play with and vs AI. I recommend AI-Game-Mode but the competive mode, the main dish so to say, sucks. I will explain. 1. This game is PAY 2 WIN, At first you might not see it directly but in later game you notice it is. The 3 Tiers are Rookie, Major and Pro. Rookie League: Either real noobs like you and me, with different outcome and so on. +Pro's with their new characters. In Rookie League some of them say stuff like ""OMG OMG WORST SF EVER"" ""LEARN TO PLAY!"" and many many harsh things. They dont bother to explain what exactly you did wrong and so on.  Even if you are C and they are SG and you dont manage to rebound EVERY ball, just maybe 50-60% it can happen easily that they start to flame. In Rookie League. Without asking your level or experience. Without explaining, without giving help.  If you manage to hit lvl 12 quick, which is easy done, the heat is on. Major League. If you mess up here, be prepared to see many censored lines^^ Next thing: Even on EU Server, you see many many Russians. And they as unfriendly as a drunk russian could be.If you dont want to sink lots of cash into the game, dont have many friends you can form a crew with and learn together with and as good as allways play together or have a thick fur or dont plan to play further than Rookie or Major League, stay away from this game. Call a friend. Play ball in RL. You might not dunk, but you might be able to end the next guy who flames you without reason or explanation.  Had fun for  a week of exstensive playtime, but that community is the worst i ever encountered.			"

												I used to play this game years ago. It was fun. It still is, aside from the obnoxious music. And the fact that I've only been able to actually get connected to the server ONCE. Frequently hangs while trying to connect to the server. Until the servers are fixed, I wouldn't bother with it. Has potential to be a good game like it used to, the music ruins it, and the horrible servers need a lot of work. I'd wait a bit longer before playing this.			"

												Ok, first, it's really fun. But not when you created a new level 1 character and being called noob. Nevertheless, you'll level up eventually, so it's not really a problem to me. For the gameplay, it's smooth and good-looking. The graphic is weird but it does give you a fresh feeling, like, you know, first time playing a game that is made in Korea. Despite the community is a little bit bad, but, just stay strong and ignore them, like you're deaf or something. It's not a big deal, but the big deal is dealing with yourself. It's F**KING HARD to ignore them, and I've played this game for 700+ hours, you know how much pain I've gone through. But it's really fun, trust me. If you're a fan of basketball, or you love to play basketball but never had the chance to play it, it's a good game. And it becomes addictive when you play it for a several hours. So, for those who want to play it(after reading my review), please do play it with your friends, because everyone there is your rival. Only some of them are friendly(just like me), so I'll see you on the court. My name is qpJackqp in-game. Now here is the rating:Audio:7/10Graphic:7/10Gameplay:9/10(because some player afk)*I assume you guys know what is ""afk""Community:6/10Overall:8/10*Also, I spent RM120 on this game, LOL			"

												Good game mechanics, clever concept, fantastic tutorial !!Would I recommend it? Absolutely NOT !!It is simply a PAY-To-WIN  game. Let me elaborate rather briefly.1) You can purchase skill slots to constantly have an upper hand, therefore no matter how uber l33t your opponents are, you have more options.2) You can purchase special game characters that have higher stats by default, so a special PF will always beat common Center under the rim. You will cap your rebound, they will still out-jump you etc.3) You can purchase cards that will make your character un-blockable.BONUS: The majority of players are from Turkey / Russia, two countries located mainly Asia whose players absolutely love playing in the EU server, despite there are 2 asian servers. This means ridiculous lag to players based in the EU.You will happily play the game at first and in the first 20-30 levels you will just give this the benefit of the doubt; then by the time you have learned the game you realise it's futile. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!			"

												This game is fun until you play with hackers. Really fun to get out some Basketball in your system. With the hackers its ever y 2-3 games you have to deal with one to an extent where they can teleport the ball from your current possion to the middle of the FT line. And every other team name has Racial slurs in it or some sexual enundos. I'm not fantastic at this game but when I'm not playing with a hacker its great even though it is semi Pay to win but it also milks the aspect of skill.I'm gonna say I don't recommend this game for now since they fail to deal with the Hacking basically says its ok to hack away to win. Better off playing NBA2k14 or 2k15. As a gamer its hard for me to talk bad about any games and it pains me to see a game thats fun to be overran by hackers.			"

												I like this game, I really do.. Its one of hte funner basketball games out there (outside of NBA 2k), The controls are relatively simple,  and it can be real competitive. The only REAL problem is all the hazers and people giving newbies hell for not be an instant legend. Its unreal how some people int his game just jump down someones throat if you miss one shot.. Overall, If you have tough skin, and dont let words and critisism bother you, I think its a game worth playing.			"

												This game all-in-all is a good game. It is free-to-play and not so pay-2-win. It still requires skills and good internet.The soundtracks are so catchy and the genre matches the game be can be repetitive and dull.The gameplay is very simple. Gamers who have experience in NBA 2K series would find this extremely easy to play.As for the characters, they are very cute and fierce. (I like Grace of Noble lol)The downside is, it is very slow to load at the start of the game and at the start and end of every game. It lags occasionally.Another downside is not everybody is speaking English, people usually prefer speaking their own language but I don't think that there's a language barrier, though. They prefer Filipino, Thai, Indonesian language and etc. (I am talking about the Asian server here) Sometimes it is an issue for them if you are from different country and their own native bad words are all around the shout-out area. Not a big deal, though, because the community is somewhat friendly too.As for customization, there are a vast number of equipments that you can use but you cannot remove the default equipment of your character for some reason. like for instance, the armband defaults.Another thing I don't like is the special characters are so expensive but I think it's okay because they are called special for a reason.I want Girls Generation (SNSD) characters to be released in the Steam version of the game too.

												This game in short is a great experience by yourself until a point.  In the game they're 2 types of ""ranking"" leagues Major and Pro.  Major is 1-24 and Pro is 24-50.  Major is more friendly and kind this is also where playing solo is fine.  But... Pro is just about impossible to play solo you NEED people to que who won't say your bad when you make one mistake and in a sense throw the game.  So in total Major is really fun, Pro, playing solo is a bad decision you pry have a better chance of throwing yourself off a cliff and hoping you don't hit your skull and have your brains splatter everywhere.

												Super fun in the lower ranks when you and everybody else are newcomers testing the waters of this interesting Free to Play sports title. Upon advancing into the higher leagues, though, it becomes clear that if you have any hope of remaining competitive you have no choice but to purchase upgrades for your character. Free alternatives for character building are available, but progression requires so much game time that there's no way to keep pace with players that have money laying around to buy clothing upgrades and abilities.

I agree, community isn't the best, BUT there're people who are good and friendly!Also, a lot of people are saying that the game is pay 2 win, it is at some point, but at the same time it isn't.Pros:1. There are A LOT of events (after one event ends, next event starts)2. Game is easy and fun to play3. On different events you can get free spc (special character), you also get free spc after hitting lvl 50 on your first character4. You can add temporary stats to your items for ingame currencyCons:1. you are at some point weak if you don't have special character (they have 40 bonus stat points which is huge boost)2. you have to invest real money to get permanent stats on itemsIn other words, if you want to be powerful in this game, all you have to do is just spend some time in this game. You don't have to invest real money to be the best.			"

												You can do a variety of things, from abnormal tricks that seem impossible if applied to logic and reality, to simple but yet outstanding team work. This game is pretty good, I have played for 9hrs and i can already tell that this is a beautiful game. 7/10There is a lot in this game despite the simple looking graphics. You can buy a ton of clothes, skills, gear ect. You can even buy pets that add to your stats. However  you need to pay to win (all the end gear) and if you're a free player then it will be hard to beat a person that has their character smothered with pay to win gear.The thing is the game is all about luck/probabilty and that's where the true skills show, you have to be able to make great postioning, thinking out the box, so on.... Pros-Very easy to pick up and learnMultiplayerCustomisable characters Applicable skills that relate to basketball. (alley oop, ect..)Cons-Pay to win ( you can buy much more with real $$$)Ball greeds (worse than football)Sometimes you get matched with that 'special snowflake'			"

Has alot of skill.What i like :- The skill- Gameplay- Funny players- Free balls that u can apperiantly get stuff from ?..- Lots of events.What i dont like :- When you reach pro evrything is about winning , and most players just want wins on pro.- I don't like how you made it lvl 0-24 To be Major. ( Or something like that ) Now the begginers that want to play get to play against players that are level 16 and get insulted , bullied , called on.- You don't get alot of points so u can buy new skills on other characters or other , but you can use a coupon that gives u some extra % on Points and Exp i think you should upgrade from around 120 - 260 IF you win Bonus if u loose well ur choice.

												The first freestyle street basketball failed because there was too much lag, too many bugs, too many toxic players.  This one will fail in time as well for the same reasons.  If you want to cheat in this game, all you have to do is download large files while you play to create a lag issue.  The opposing team won't be able to block your shots, or steal from you, or even escape you if you are trying to guard from their shots.  I have tried that tactic and it works every time.  Being an international game with no servers for each region of the world, lag is a very major issue.By the way, unless you buy one of the premium characters, you will go nowhere.  It is definitely pay to win.			"

												This game is fun as hell and super good but let me explain why i rated as ""Not Recommended""The players, that is the biggest thing in a game like this , a game that forces co-op , the player base is full of russians or asians that do not understand english and makes it pretty much impossible to comunicate , it is also full of a bunch of 12 years old that as soon as  they pick the ball they want to do everything alone , and they wont pass you.So , want a game super fun but no one will understand you or pass you? There you have it! (Remember the game itself is good but the players suck)			"

												Its a good game, however its a f*cking P2W. It always has been ever since it was created with Sierra, I been playing FS for a very long time. However, I will not be putting this as a negative review since I still play this game and will always play it. I just love FS. Don't my cons scare you, however take it in consideration since it's true. If you don't believe me play FS 2 for about 25 hours and then tell me what you see.Now here is the pro and cons:Pros:- Fun game when you have respectful playersCons:- P2W: Pay to Win, which is very true. For example: When you buy a special character, you get a bonus stats when you create them. So if you were a PF, you would get a bonus like 5+ or something like that.- LAGGY, most of the players are from other countries playing on the US server. When you ask them why they don't play on theirs, they say something like ""Nobody is on the server, blah blah""- There are some good clothes in the game, however if you want to add attributes to them you can but they only last like 30 days or so. It wasn't like in FS, where some clothes you could pay to add attributs and it stays with you forever.- The freestyles are random and you never get to choose which ones you want like in FS. For example, if I wanted miller time for my SG, I would have to get Freestlye tickets and play the random sh*t hoping I could get it.- Most people don't know how to play at all, and also there is a lot of holders when it's the last 20 seconds.- The last thing, its a god damn PAY TO WIN. So, if you want to win a lot, you either do two things: First, pay money to get special characters, etc. Blah blah. Two: practice a lot and learn to PASS the ball, and use teamwork. I prefer the second option since in this game, it is easy to beat the special characters. And it's called TEAMWORK!!!			"

												The game is fun, don't get me wrong, but there is so much P2W aspects of the game it's unreal. It's great for a F2P game, but they could make money the right way and not allow people to P 2 W! There needs to be more modes; maybe a 5v5 full court action. Make the game more realistic and add some more physics and allow me to be able to block a dunk. There is also way too much to the game yet way too little, and what I mean by that, is there are stat cards and free styles and ""magic"" clothes that would give you the edge in a match. Just have normal basketball, that's all you need. Too little, basically what I said before, to where there aren't any game modes, and just there isn't much customization either, unless you wanna be a dragon helmeted nba player or a humongous black Jonas Brother. It's fun, but there's issues I'd hope and many others would hope they fix.			"

												I played the very first Freestyle Basketball and then i downloaded the asian version of Freestyle 2 back when it wasn't available for the United States, and I had played it very often when it was available. The one hour I have on steam was to see if this game was still pay to win, sadly it is. When you make a character you get to choose your position and you get to choose between a few sample characters with different heights, if you PAY the game though you can unlock other characters that have boosted stats and are much bigger than you. They will always be better than you no matter how much you play, this game is slightly skill based but it is very much like an arcade game. Rebounds can be grabbed from the other side of the goal just because a player has a higher attribute than you, regardless of your timing and positioning for it. Most shots fall in this game if you dont block them, which if you pay, you block everything. This game has the potential to be so much better, especially because it is the only basketball MMO out there, but they are stupid.			"

												Great F2P, even fun for people who don't play basketball. People say the game is Pay to win, because paid characters get better stats is NOT true. anyone who didn't pay can beat them, you can even win Paid characters from Daily log-in rewards (Not every log-in reward but I got a Noble from the log-in reward). The community is pretty toxic as well, But it is so fun to trash talk the other team when you beat them! Also very fun to play with friends, and sometimes random people but they can be rude at times. They could improve the loading time, the lag, and graphics. But other than that the game is one of the best F2P's I've ever played on here, and they always update the game!			"

												Great  F2P  game for basketball lovers. Fun to play with friends. It's not  p2w (I repeat IT'S NOT P2W)  , it's  skill based  and the  timing  is important here. People are saying that it is p2w because of the special characters. Yeah they have 40 extra free stats to spend but they aren't impossible to beat and the events in the game are giving you multiple chances to earn those special characters (I have 2 and I didn't spend even 0.01$ on the game).Teamwork is essential in this game. Without teamword you will lose all the time!TL;DR:Pros:+fun to play with friends+you can win special characters for free+you can get almost everything for free+on every match there is a small chance for the game to be streamed accross the server and the spectators can vote for your team.+there is some sort of 1v1+the gameplay is smooth+there is a Club system with tournamentsCons:-there are some bugs-its rare to find a player who will listen to what you are saying to him-some people have laggy connections to the server			"

You need freinds and skype and this game will be a blast. Really competitive. Also their is a bug in the game for if you have a card after you win that is generated as a blank card. You are always bound to get it unless one isnt generated. Good game to goof around. Tip F  is to dunk for all the new people wanting to be a dunker Greadt game.You should really try it out			"

												This game sorta stinks. I can't find a grasp on how the shooting gauge works. The MC is God awfully annoying, since all he says is ""nice pass!"" ""oh you sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"". Community is filled with stuck up tight-wads with too much bullplop in their ears. Megaphones (an all out broadcast to the server) usually says something from xXx__BALLisLIFE__xXx ""heh rekt u #@$# pretty easily step up your game"". I find these rather disparaging comments annoying.The rookie channel is, as a commenter said before, filled with pros, as people could not merge their old accounts onto Steam. Articles of clothing are merely for looks, which really shows if someone has easy access to their parents' credit card number. Rookie channel, again, has some people failing a layup or easily shooting half-court threes with no trouble. The game lags a bit, sometimes characters and the ball spazzing out, or having characters that are nowhere near the ball all of a sudden having it.The community, as said, is a bunch of stuck up tight-wads. Some people ball hog and just keep dunking. Others can't read English, as when you need to go for 3's, they keep making layups. Like what the crud bro.The swearing filter has a really low bar. Words like ""crap"", ""crud"", ""wtf"", and even IDK has DK censored into i**, assuming dk is short for ""♥♥♥♥"". That really throws me off about this game.To summarize, a stuck up community, poorly optimized gameplay, really harsh swearing filter, spazzy characters and items. Also, don't forget really crappy random drops. Keep pulling blank cards. Continuing: megaphone abuse, and the somehow hated cell-shaded art. I really adore cell shading, so this game is looks nice. Then again, I haven't optimized it for my computer yet. Yet.Overall, game gets like a 2.5 out of 5 stars. Give it a whirl. If it's not your thing, then uninstall it. That's what I'll be doing.			"

I can't wait for Full-Court or more people in game cause this game has NAILED IT on gameplay for a basketball game. I love this.I truly feel like it's not Pay to win, and even if they do pay, a good amount of skill counters that.  or double blocking a player!! It's all about tactics and smarts. I'd be more than happy to donate to this game too!! I've never payed for anything on this game btw. I hope it gets more versions , maybe in Full Court cause it's just too small of a map.			"

												April 1st Review(04/01/15):Freestyle 2 is a third-person shooter, action, MMORPG, team-based, real time strategy(RTS), sports, simulation, godly game. No one should ever talk ♥♥♥♥ about this glorious, godly game. This game deserves a 10/10 especially in the support, options, and spelling department(do they have a spelling department?). Please, rate 11/10 and play game all day everyday. Definitely no BS and no fail mechanics like good-ping-to-rebound, late blocking, bs blocks, or bs shots. NONE OF THIS IS IN THE GAME. DEFINITELY ALL BASKETBALL MECHANICS ARE LEGIT.

												April 1st Review(04/01/15):Freestyle 2 is a third-person shooter, action, MMORPG, team-based, real time strategy(RTS), sports, simulation, godly game. No one should ever talk ♥♥♥♥ about this glorious, godly game. This game deserves a 10/10 especially in the support, options, and spelling department(do they have a spelling department?). Please, rate 11/10 and play game all day everyday. Definitely no BS and no fail mechanics like good-ping-to-rebound, late blocking, bs blocks, or bs shots. NONE OF THIS IS IN THE GAME.

 WARNING! I DID NOT PLAY THE GAME THROUGH STEAM, BUT THROUGH THE CLIENT!  Sad. All the money I poured in. All the thoughts I had about future things I would be getting. Grinding and working hard. Took me a year to get to level 50, because I had work piled on top of school. Looking back, all I wish is that I hadn't. I wish I hadn't gotten hooked to this, I wish I hadn't wasted so much time on this, I wish I hadn't enjoyed playing games with my friends so that some miracle would prevent me from this disease.  PROS!  This game hooks you in once you get into it. The moment you see the flawless design, to the amazing slams and layups you could possibly pull of, you love it. I loved it; maybe I still do. Beautiful graphics,  not like CoD or BF1 or anything but y'know what I mean, haha.  great gameplay system, loads of fun with friends, customizability goes through the roof, etc. These statements make great points, but there are reasons why I don't recommend it.  CONS!  No mercy. Simply no mercy for new players. Thankfully, when I started there wasn't many players that would smurf in the first rookie channel, but soon after, it was extremely toxic. After you hit major-pro grounds, players will bash you for your playing, upon other things. If you look like a noob, you'll be treated like a noob. The worst part of games is a toxic community. To keep games running, you need a good community. Secondly, the game overall is P2W. There are things you can get that aren't pay to win, but to be the best of the best, you'll need to spend hundreds upon thousands of dollars on equipment. Clothes can get additional strengths to be added to them, which is unfair. Another thing that is unfair is that you can purchase physically advanced characters with ""better looks"" as well as stats, and another 60 points to spend on stats. There is unbearable lag, and the controls absolutely suck for beginners. They cannot keep players in their game what-so-ever. Some moves are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and said that some shots make it in and there are certain things you can or can't do. The only time skill matters is when you hit level 50.  Saying that someone saying that it's a P2W game because they suck is illogical. I'm not a bad player, and I'm not good either, but I notice when something is wrong with a ♥♥♥♥ing game, and I know when to quit. Go ahead. Get addicted, let's see how you turn out, because it's not like I didn't spend all night on this game and I'm just a 1 time player, c'mon now. Shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, seriously, lol.   End Conclusion I don't recommend this game to anyone without money. Lots of money. To keep up, you will need to keep spending. Even the top players know that. They know they've spent hundreds of dollars on a F2P game,  and I'm sure that's something they regret.  and they know they've wasted their time on a trash, disfunctional game.			"

												Played it for a week, had my fill. that's basically it. It's fun for a while but gets extremely repetitive and lacks any motivation to go on after you've customized your character the way you wanted. Of course, that's the case if you're not interested in rankings, tournaments and the like.    I haven't spent any money on it. ""Loot drops"" are frequent and, sometimes, they give you really nice items. However, I don't see how the game is ""completely p2w"" according to some people. You can only buy stat boosts with in-game currency and it's not hard to get if you play well enough and long enough.Customizing your character is really enjoyable and gives you a reason to play more just because you want to earn enough points to get that hat/shirt/hair.   My biggest problem with the game is the atrocious soundtrack. Of course, that's personal preference but in my opinion it was spine-chillingly unbearable. Awful Korean(?) hip-hop-pop tracks (guess it would be called k-hop, or k-rap, or whatever just so that its fans can distinguish themselves from others and feel ""so original and amazing"").   To end this - it's not a bad game, it's free and it can pretty much run on anything so there's no problem with anybody trying it. If you find it more entertaining than I did you can easily spend more than a week playing it. P.S. (Edit): I didn't expect to enjoy this game and was pleasantly surprised, so don't go into it with any prejudice.			"

												The premise is cool and I was really looking forward to this but... no. It's not like I hate it, nor did I have a terrible experience playing it. Sadly it just doesn't really add up to an enjoyable game.Let's break this down quickly:PROS-- Cool Idea.  3v3 Online Basketball? Check.- Graphics are decent (Aside from horribly clunky animation)CONS-- No controller support.... in a sports game? In 2015?- No way of remapping keys. (Hope you like arrow key movement.)- OMG the music gets repetitive, and it never.stops.playing.- Doesn't feel like a basketball game, just a twitchy ""be in the right place and press the right button at the right time"" sim.- Pay to Win- No full court options.- Twichy Clitchy Clunky Character animations when playing. (Just look at the gameplay videos)- User Interface is confusing at best- No character creation, just customizing existing characters.I wanted to like this game, I really did. I love basketball, and the thought of a F2P online basketball MMO where you play as a single player sounded awesome.Sadly after playing the game for about an hour and just closed it and uninstalled. This is NOT the game for you if you have a sports game itch wanting to be scratched. The gameplay basically consists of keeping your character as close the the opponents as possible and then pressing the appropriate button of steal or block at the right time. That's defense. Offense is basically just the opposite, but your steal and block buttons change to pass and shoot. Simple enough, the controls seem streamlined, although awkward. Only one problem... you can't change them. At all. No remapping, no controller support... wtf.In game your character feels very sluggish when moving... even when you hit your dash key he moves forward about a head's width. Really. The half court isn't bad, but I'd love to see at least an OPTION for full court play. (though with the slow, clunky characters it'd take forever to traverse.) After playing 2 games I wanted to punch the person who made the music. It becomes obnoxious very quickly. There's about 3 songs, that just loop...All in all I can't say I enjoyed playing this. It doesn't feel like a basketball game, and it's shortcomings, especially the controls, really kill it. (Some people may argue you can use third party programs to make a controller work with the game, but that does NOT excuse the game for not having any controller or remapping capability itself.)TLDR:If you want to play a fun basketball game, go play something else.

												Needs Eastcoast North American Servers. The ping disparities between players is the games biggest promblem (esspecially players who have or are willing to invest in the game).  The Game is mechanically pleasing, but the focus seems to be locked   on cosmetics and special characters  (which is fine to an extent), instead of investing in stability for an underserved portion of the community. The game is worth playing casually, but ping can potentially stand in the way of passing the treshhold of being from being decent to good-thus i cannot recommend spending money with 80+ ms. I honestly, dont recommend playing a PF,CT, C if your Ping is that high (not  because its not possible, it is, but it is not rewarding you will have to work twice as hard as westcoast counterparts).

The other 2 are based on either AI mechanics that you have no say over, or other players in your party.  You can ask the AI to pass you the ball but they don't always comply due to the situation.  This game would be a lot better if you could control the AI members of your party.  Don't expect a normal single player B-Ball gaming experience for that very reason.  You need to make a team of real people to actually win games easily.  The AI won't do more advanced manuevers often like the ones they show you in the tutorial either.  They just dribble, pass, shoot.  Sometimes they won't even go for the ball when it's loose & they'll get it stolen when they have it.Controller support is also lacking.  No D-Input support, so you better have an X-Input controller.  Even then it's still confusing as hell because the game is based purely on Keyboard & you have to look up the button maps online to know what button does what.Graphics are good, the game is half-court basketball with official rules.  So it's a decent half court b-ball sim game. The music is probably the best part of the game.  ""We be ballin'!""  I gotta say this soundtrack is really catchy & fits the game almost perfectly for an outside half-court b-ball game.Overall after playing this game a few hours (outside of Steam) it's a good game IF you have 2 other people to play it with, but since I don't have 2 friends to play with my experience was sour. The AI is mediocre at best & difficult to coordinate with.  If you play this game definitely play with friends.  If you don't have friends interested in playing it with you then you might as well not play it at all.			"

												This game in all honesty is one of the best virtual basketball games. With a team of 3 you can battle other teams and win chances to get coins or xp spent on improving your player. Their has been an update where now every free to recieve clothing and double Xp. Been playing this game since last year and haven't gotten disapointed yet. It even gets better when you play with friends from steam.			"

												Ok, so where should i start ?1. Once you actually start the game you have absolutly no idea what you have to do, or whatever you actually can do. You just see lots and lots of buttons on your screen and noone is going to explain you what to do. Sure, the Tutorial teaches you the basics of the actual gameplay, but thats it.2. After some try outs you finaly found out how to start Matches with other Players...but oh wait...noone is gonna play with you, because youre a noob....and yes you are on the beginner server, but noone really cares, they just kick you out....constantly. 3. If you somehow manage to get in a game, and you are really about to play....forget everything you know about Basketball buddy...teamplay ? pff this is the internet !!! If you dont have the Ball right off the start, ull never gonna get it again...at least not from your teammates that is. Your only chance to get the Ball is to make some lucky Rebounds or Steals, but passing the Ball seems to be somewhat prohibited in this game. so yes, after a little more of an hour i managed to join 15 Rooms, got kicked out of 14 instantly, had 1 match with other People and never got a pass. All you gonna hear is "" pass the ball "" spamming from your teammates, eventhough they gonna ignore you once they get the ball. If you like this kind of "" Ego-Imthegreatest13yokiddyeva "" Game, go ahead and waste your time.			"

												This is *very close* to being good. But it just isn't. It's clunky, the controls are somewhat uncomfortable and not smooth at all. Using a controller/gamepad should be the default, you'd think- but the game is made for keyboards and it seems gamepad support was an afterthought. The game is also horribly laggy.Every screen packs in as many 'look! buy this shiny crap!' buttons as possible. All that being said, I think you should still at least give it a shot, since it's free and can provide a little bit of 3-on-3 fun. But don't expect for this to be the 'NBA Live Online' MMO you've always dreamed of.			"

												Okay this will be my review for FreeStyle2: (Opinion Based) <ReadAwayHaters>[Brief Introduction]i played the first version of this game back in my childhood and it was really fun although i am not a basketball fan freestyle will always have the top spot on my sportgames list until something comes out in the category but alas i will say this i am no fan of any sport games as i lean myself towards Roleplay and Mobas.this game died out on me as time passed because it wasnt really getting any interesting apart that my friends only played Ragnarok back then so without noticing i was drifted away from this game. (""10""? years) later [Maybe]i as a steam user check frequently on Free2Play Games and stumbled upon this game once more and decided to give it a try, i then told my friends about this gem of a game and sooner than we expected we were hooked to this game.if it werent for the competitiveness (and maybe) because i have fun with my friends i would personally set this game aside.and so 45Hours into the game i decided to make a review about this game, here are my Pros and Cons[PROS]<Competition>:: this game offers more than what you would expect and since it is a street basketball game each match will keep you sweating and shouting for better plays<Basketball>:: who doesnt love a good ol'Basketball game<Style>:: ability to choose what you look before going into a match to distinguish your character makes you feel great and awesome, who wouldnt want to go in looking fabulous?<Suspense>:: anything can happen within the match, i have encountered many times a great comeback<Reminiscence>:: remembering freestyle 1 and how far its gone is a great achievement for this game as i have never expected nor did it cross my mind to come back after all these years<Teamwork>:: you need 100% teamwork, so what if you keep getting those 3pts, hogging the ball will get you no where.i personally always play with my friends as we are always on skype to get better communication and coordination but playing with people you know you wouldnt need to say anything because they know how you play so all you need to do is give a signal and do the play<Something New>:: Mobas here and there, isnt it getting boring? FreeStyle 2 did the right choice to go on steam{CONS}>LAG<:: Yes, i am from the asian side of the world so most asians will understand my pain that we are having a hard time playing this game due to connection problems and sudden delays.>Elitists<:: you wont have fun as an SG i guarantee you that. you will be criticized>Unorganized Menus<:: its easy to understand and navigate BUT too messy in my opinion>Control Change<:: give us freedom to change these CONTROLS"" http://steamcommunity.com/app/339610/discussions/0/618458030676990749/ "" those of you who would like to support the Controls please bump this.[Other Concerns]-other than that i have no problem with the game.fix the asian servers asap.-This is my Review as of now. this may change or vary depending on how the game will turn out in the future4/12/2015			"

												Coming from a old Freestyle player, this is a nice little treat.My thoughts:GOOD:- Teamwork required.- Scoring feels satisfying.- Costumization.- Good latency and lag compensation.- Crew/Team Matches- Easy to get into, hard to master.- If you're good at the game in terms of skill you'll notice you beat people with a lot of P2W stuff but you'll probably lose anyways.- Achievement system, challenges, bingo, My Ball, freestyles and other stuff to keep you busy.- MVP Rewards, the player that contributes more to the game/team gets awarded for it even if you lose.BAD:- Leveling is slow.- No filters to sort out rooms.- The game doesn't kick players that just stay there AFK (ex. You open a room and stay with it open forever without starting any game).- No ""click a button"" Auto-Matchmaking to avoid room problems.- It seems like there's low playerbase some times.- A bunch of P2W stuff that you need to get better.- Menus are a little confusing for new players but you'll get used to it.- Should have a better introduction.- Servers have problems, be sure you play on your closest region or you'll find yourself DCing or having lag problems.*Overall it's really fun but difficult to get good at and understand how the game and systems work, give it a try!

												When I saw this, I was hoping for a competent street basketball game with some paid character customizations and some kinda gross paid stat boosts. What I found instead was a poorly translated storefront with a terrible basketball game attached.Best I can tell, you are forced to control your character with the keyboard rather than a gamepad, which seems an odd choice for a basketball game. The rules of the game (both in terms of the rules in the rulebook and the way basketball works) are implemented very simplisticly. For example, if you want to block a shot, You'll need to be sure you're in front of the shooting player. It's literally impossible to block a short from the side or from behind. It feels like a board game implementation of basketball, and, as much as I like board games, the beauty of video games is that the game can juggle as many rules and variables as you can throw at it. Board games have to be simplified because people have to manage all those rules themselves. For a game as dynamic as basketball, this implementation doesn't create a very satisfying experience.The UI is ridiculous. Every screen has dozens of buttons labeled mostly with cryptic icons. As a new player, you'll be given several reward items after logging in, but you'll have no idea what they are or why you would want them. In this way, the game is extremely hostile to new players.If there is any fun to be had in this game, it's well hidden behind a smokescreen of odd design decisions and mechanisms designed to get you to give them money.

												If you use teamspeak do not install this game unless you are willing to embark on a journey that will take you to the inner depths of your registry files to find a singular issue that cant even be fixed unless a system restore is started. The game itself is ok, I'd give it a 6/10 but the teamspeak issue brings it down to 0/10. My teamspeak files are permanently corrupted even with a fresh install and I'm not willing to factory restore to play a moderately ok basketball game. My teamspeak will never be the same. Letters are now random signs, icons have turned into numbers and the very foundation of my voice-chatting has been irreparably damaged. This game ruined my life, do not install until it is patched.

The mechanics is way different & more fluent/realistic.I didn't start alone though. I called a few friends to come & play with me, next thing you know, we enjoyed the game so much, we made our first max level. So after hitting max level, i made a new position & repeated that process til i made every position to 50. Besides the server/ping issue going around, the community was somewhat easy to connect with.I'll recommend this for anyone whose into sport game & connecting with people. "

Freestyle2 is a free to play MMO basketball game which is both awesome and nerve-wracking. First, I'll get into the positives and then I'll rant about the major issues.To begin with, it's a street basketball, thus, it's played on one basket, there are no fouls, free throws, etc. Matches last 5 minutes, they have overtimes and replays. I won't be going into the details about the basketball itself because it's self-explanatory. Next, in order to jump into the match, you must pick a position and a character which is customizable to an extent. Then you'll be launched into a really confusing lobby screen with tons of options. You'll notice card sets, toys (mascots), sh*tload of events, etc.. Next, there's training mode which is essential for a newbie. You'll get a chance to practice every ability of your chosen position. Those skills, if not yet acquired, will be available to buy in skill shop as you level up. For more flashy jukes you can try equipping freestyles.So the main problem with this game from my experience is the skill gap. Once you get out of the rookie channel you'll be greeted by max level veterans with best skills available, proficiency and a sh*tty attitude towards newcomers. The community is so cancerous (most of the time) that only Russians in CS:GO can compete against them. The gap is huge and you'll be roasted multiple times and lose the majority of your matches, I can guarantee that since it isn't an easy game.Secondly, there are a lot of microtransactions which aren't just for a cosmetic look. You can get stuff like new characters with additional skill points, buffed items and other stuff which affects your stats and gives you an advantage. Though it's possible to get them without spending real money, it's pretty tough to do so.Lastly, there are many bugs, freezes and connection stability issues and they show up pretty often. Besides, many people state that there's a bitcoin miner inside the game files..  that's a first.TL;DRPros:● Fun gameplay● Challenging● A wide choice of clothes, accessories, cards, toys, skills..● Many events● Exhilarating musicCons:● Pay2win-ish● Many bugs, freezes, connection issues● Leaning towards unbalance● Bitcoin miner inside the game● Unchangeable character appearance except for clothes, accessories and hair● Crappy communityOverall, this game is fun and competitive but has so many problems and a wasted potential.8/10 "

												Hello All! I am known as Sinth, Cyntherea, BuckTucker and Persephone/♥♥♥♥♥ in this community. I have played the FSSB Series since its inception in North America.  History of Freestyle. [ http]In late 2006 I started playing the Sierra Online Alpha version when it hit North America. I was instantly hooked. The pace of this game and the intricicies involved in ""Pro"" play are what keeps me engaged.We cannot compare this version of Freestyle with the versions that came before it so I will review FSSB2 on it's own merits.Review:This is a F2P game. You don't have to pay anything to get started and you don't have to pay anything to be ""pro"".  Create your character: Power Forward, Center, Small Forward, Shooting Guard, Point Guard.  It helps to have a basic understanding of Basketball to understand what these positions mean. You get a few default characters, with different stats based on position. Their are ""Special Characters"" or SPC's that you can buy with real money that have enhanced stats. What some people fail to realize is that if you are a ""Free Player"", that means NOT SPENDING $$$, you get a FREE SPC at level 50. So, no. you don't have to pay to get a Special Character. People that play this game are gonna say, ""♥♥♥♥♥/Sinth/Buck what about having to pay for extra skill slots?"" Yes, extra skill slots cost $$$. My answer is, that if you want/NEED those then you are already high enough level or dedicated enough to ""need"" them. You can absolutely play without spending money. I have several alts that don't spend a dime and do just fine.Now the the F2P/P2P thing is out of the way, onto the game.This is an arcadey Street Basketball game with cartoony graphics and has an urban flavor.  If you like fast paced sports action and have a need for twitch reflexology, then I can't recommend this game enough. If you hate childish, racist, ageist (I'm 40 years old) smacktalk... Uh... Look elsewhere. The community is harsh. Most of the community is 20ish... some older, most younger, and most very immature. Please don't let them get to you. Apparantly, IRL people talk trash on the court. I don't get it because I don't hoop IRL and haven't since the early 1990's...anyway...Graphics: 6/10-Cartoony characters, weird looking pets (pets give you + to attributes), odd outfitsSound: 6/10- I turn off in game music and run Pandora in the background. People like to spam their emotes... BTW guys... super annoying.Gameplay: 9/10- This game is all about timing, coordination and using skills wisely. It gets it right (PF's are OP but meh, I main PF), the classes are fun and true to their real life counterparts.Fun Factor: 1-10- It's not a lot of fun to play with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's fun to play with people that at least try. Don't be an elitist and you will have more fun.I currently have 3 level 50's, 3 more toons in pro around level 40 and several other stragglers. Hit me up in-game and seek out Team Bruh if you are looking for a Crew (Club/Clan). I will be in rookie on a C, I look forward to seing you all and have FUN!Also: I have always played with a controller. I do not play with a keyboard, if you can... I am amazed.Signed,BuckTucker - TeamBruh "

												I would definatly recommend this game. Its really fun and the skills and tricks you can do are aweome too. *_* So many different Slam Dunks you can do. The game is pretty balanced and you don't need to spend real money to look good. 10/10. The only things that are annoy me are no controller support, bad team mates driving me crazy, sometimes lag and blocking at times >.<. Other than that its a really good game. I made a tutorial on how to use a controller over here!

												Every year, as soon as the cold weather sets in, my hands become dry and flaky. With flu and cold season in full swing, I turn to excess hand washing, which always strips the moisture from my skin. To slough off dead skin cells and restore moisture, I make a batch of exfoliating sea salt hand scrub and keep it by my kitchen sink to enjoy all winter long.Though it's perfectly acceptable to keep this scrub to yourself, it also makes a great gift to give around the holidays. It's remarkably easy to throw together, so as long as you have all (three) of the ingredients on hand, you can whip up a quick batch. It's a thoughtful, customizable alternative to store-bought gifts, and ensures you'll never show up empty-handed to a party or dinner again.What You NeedSupplies1 cup coarse sea salt1/2 cup liquid coconut oil5 to 7 drops grapefruit essential oilEquipmentDry measuring cups10-ounce glass container (I used a Weck canning jar)ForkInstructionsGrab your supplies. You'll need 1 cup coarse sea salt, 1/2 cup liquid coconut oil, 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil, and a 10-ounce glass container.Add the salt. Pour 1 cup of salt into the empty glass container.Add the oil. Pour 1/2 cup of coconut oil over the salt.Add essential oil. Add 5 to 7 drops of grapefruit essential oil to mixture.Stir the mixture.

Seal the jar and affix a label or gift tag to the top.Recipe NotesUse scrub sparingly — about once or twice a week — by spooning a small amount into your hands, gently rubbing it in, rinsing it off with warm water, and drying your hands thoroughly.I tried (and failed) to wrap both ribbon and twine around this jar.

												Waste of time. Ignore the fact that the initial loading screen takes 5-10 minutes for God knows why. Ignore the fact that the UI is dog vomit. Ignore the usual P2W tropes, because they are all here and there is nothing to be said for it that hasn't already been said a thousand times for P2P games.I understand this is ""street ball"" as the term is used by the community as an excuse for how terrible competitive play is. The actual gameplay still doesn't make sense. 3 Point shots are made 90% of the time regardless of how much Defense is on the shooter, so the entire community just dribbles for 20 minutes and chucks up the ball from behind the perimeter and it just goes in inexplicably. Defense is TRASH on this game. Most of the blocks in this game are goal tends, meaning the person can just swat the ball way after its already coming down towards the goal. You can do this thing where you try to square up to your openent with your arms out, but that does jack ♥♥♥♥, as the offensive dribble animations are so jerky and sudden they will always have space to chuck up a shot with 90% chance of it falling. There is absolutely NO reason to put attribute points into any defensive stat. I'm harping on defense because if the game had it, it would potentially be competitive. But it's just, ""Let me arbitrarily move around near my opponent and hope the tilted RNG will let their ugly randomly thrown shot that im contesting miss."" I've watched games where everyone is pro-level and it's still the same. do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dribble animation and toss ball from 3 point line.Calling it Streetball isn't an excuse to have severely unbalanced gameplay. P.S Community actually gets upset at you if you don't just chuck up 3's the entire time as a SG. You arent allowed to drive or take an open 2. Even if you make it, You get called a ""Bad SG"". Even if you get an offensive rebound near the rim they expect you to dribble back out over the perimeter to chuck a 3. Why are we even allowed to put points in other attribute categories, then? ♥♥♥♥ it, uninstalled.""Steph Curry: The Game"" gets a 2/10 from me. "

												Pros:+Nice presentation+Good and fluent gameplay+No network or input lags+Much fun in levels 1-11+motivating events+lots and lots of customizationCons:-horrible Pay2Win character systemWell it was really fun and refreshing at first. Gameplay is good and fun, and even if you got 1 bad player on your team, no game is lost. Also the Presentation is cool and even playing Defence is rewarding.I was fed up with NBA2k15s streetball mode, because it was lagging so hard it was unplayable. This game felt very direct and no lags at all. That part was really well done.But that said ... what ruins my experience after over 24h ingame is the Pay2Win which is absolutely over the top.If you play with the normal characters vs. normal characters, it is all fun and fair. I also don't mind paying for faster leveling or extra gear, not even for some additional skillslots and other minor advantages.What absolutely kills the game are the special purchaseable characters. While there are some that only grant a minor advantage like a small stats boost in a certain stat, there are some that just can't be beaten with the free chars, unless the other player is a total noob.As an example, playing as Center, it is impossible to get rebounds vs. some pay-centers, even with the perfect timing.  If you walk into them they just push you away automatically and you stumble backwards, for example. So no chance of even getting close to the hoop.Also there are chars that grant you a +40 stats boost that you can assign as you wish. And that is A LOT!So if you level up, you get +2 stats per level. so These speciial chars have a 20 level advantage over you statswise. This just can not be beaten. It is like playing a level 1 vs. level 20 char ... or 10 vs. 30 and so on.This is just very very frustrating and unfair.I really like the game, but I do not see a point in spending 10 bucks on chars I don't want to play because the P2W system forces me to. And then ... I don't think it is entertaining pounding normal chars with my pay chars, because they have no chance. There is no challenge in that and it would be unrewarding and boring. At least for me.So one good thing is, the game offers a newby channel. There is a normalchannel for levels 1-11 and a newby channel 1-11. You can only get into the newby channel if you did not level a char past level 11. While I was in there, it was the most fun and the best times. Why, because almost noone had those imba chars there.once you move to the normal channel or past level 12 ... you encounter a pay char in what feels like 2/3 of the games. If you are ""lucky"" you get that guy/gal on your team ... easy mode. If you are even unluckyer, it is your direct opponent. If you quit the game, you do not get the rewards ... so you just get pounded for another 5 minutes. I always try to compete ... which in the end just makes it more frustrating. And now brings me to the point where I uninstall the game and move on.			"

												You really only use 3 buttons to play the game other than the arrows, so theres not much ""freestyle"". The character customization is weak, everyone shares the same characters but gets to dress them up differently. There's little to no info available about some of the items in game, and even after downloading a PDF guide from the game's official website I couldnt figure out what a lot of things were for.

												Waste of time. Ignore the fact that the initial loading screen takes 5-10 minutes for God knows why. Ignore the fact that the UI is dog vomit. Ignore the usual P2W tropes, because they are all here and there is nothing to be said for it that hasn't already been said a thousand times for P2P games.I understand this is ""street ball"" as the term is used by the community as an excuse for how terrible competitive play is. The actual gameplay still doesn't make sense. 3 Point shots are made 90% of the time regardless of how much Defense is on the shooter, so the entire community just dribbles for 20 minutes and chucks up the ball from behind the perimeter and it just goes in inexplicably. Defense is TRASH on this game. Most of the blocks in this game are goal tends, meaning the person can just swat the ball way after its already coming down towards the goal. You can do this thing where you try to square up to your openent with your arms out, but that does jack ♥♥♥♥, as the offensive dribble animations are so jerky and sudden they will always have space to chuck up a shot with 90% chance of it falling. There is absolutely NO reason to put attribute points into any defensive stat. I'm harping on defense because if the game had it, it would potentially be competitive. But it's just, ""Let me arbitrarily move around near my opponent and hope the tilted RNG will let their ugly randomly thrown shot that im contesting miss."" I've watched games where everyone is pro-level and it's still the same. do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dribble animation and toss ball from 3 point line.Calling it Streetball isn't an excuse to have severely unbalanced gameplay. P.S Community actually gets upset at you if you don't just chuck up 3's the entire time as a SG. You arent allowed to drive or take an open 2. Even if you make it, You get called a ""Bad SG"". Even if you get an offensive rebound near the rim they expect you to dribble back out over the perimeter to chuck a 3. Why are we even allowed to put points in other attribute categories, then? ♥♥♥♥ it, uninstalled.""Steph Curry: The Game"" gets a 2/10 from me. "

SG and PF is broken, they're far too OP against the other positions, no reason to play PG, SF or C. (SG never misses 3pt and PF can rebound and dunk just as good as C also they're faster.3. I'm uninstalling this ♥♥♥♥ and going back to NBA2K.4. Feels I was scammed even if the game is free.5. Do not install this crap, it might seem fun at first, but after a while you will realize that you have wasted time and it feels like your soul is ripped from your body.			"

												I recommend this game because THERE IS NO GAME LIKE THAT ONE. I mean, this game is REALLY BAD. Lag problems, community, P2W system etc. But it's one of the old time game which is completely about having fun. But bad community ruining it. You need to be a good player to have fun. Because the community wants always good players. If you're bad or they don't know your name, they will kick you from room. It's hard to find a team at first. It's almost impossible to play with a good team at first. You need to prove yourself to the community. -I'll write my short story here, you can skip this one.-I'm playing this game for years. (years like that: I played for 5-7 months and stop playing for another 5-7 months) At first, I create a SG. I was bad. But in Major channel, there was a lot of players like me. I was trying to find a team who won't gonna kick me. And we're always losing because my teammates are kicking from other rooms too. We weren't prove ourself to the community. When I hit the Pro channel, EVERYONE started to kick me because they are much better than major channel. And I was one of the worst SG's in that pro channel.(my level was 30 btw) I stop playing for months. Then I came back because I like basketball. I created a C this time. I know mechanics, and I know how important to getting rebounds.(because of my bad shots) At first, I'ts hard to play with C but I was getting better. I prove myself in Major channel. No one kicking me unless they weren't waiting their friend. And I hit the pro channel again. They were less kicking me this time. One guy taught me how to block and thats how I started to rise. I wasn't know there was mechanics like that. I started to watch guides on YouTube and improve myself. Even I was in the second clan on the leaderboard. We were playing ranked match for raising our clan. And once, we match the first clan. (I'm saying once because I have lag problem. My ping was always between 80-120. And I was C ! If you ever played this game, you'll understand my situation) We played and lost it. They were playing realy good and I couldn't catch up my friends. And I realise I need to train much more with my teammates.(and need to have low ping. trust me it's too hard with that ping) I played few months more and stop playing again. I started again few times later, but thats enough for my story.TL;DRIf you want to be best, you need play this game A LOT. And you need to make great synergy with your teammates. (and needs low ping) Thats what Freestyle 2: Street Basketball.Thanks for reading.			"

												Pros:+Nice presentation+Good and fluent gameplay+No network or input lags+Much fun in levels 1-11+motivating events+lots and lots of customizationCons:-horrible Pay2Win character systemWell it was really fun and refreshing at first. Gameplay is good and fun, and even if you got 1 bad player on your team, no game is lost. Also the Presentation is cool and even playing Defence is rewarding.I was fed up with NBA2k15s streetball mode, because it was lagging so hard it was unplayable. This game felt very direct and no lags at all. That part was really well done.But that said ... what ruins my experience after over 24h ingame is the Pay2Win which is absolutely over the top.If you play with the normal characters vs. normal characters, it is all fun and fair. I also don't mind paying for faster leveling or extra gear, not even for some additional skillslots and other minor advantages.What absolutely kills the game are the special purchaseable characters. While there are some that only grant a minor advantage like a small stats boost in a certain stat, there are some that just can't be beaten with the free chars, unless the other player is a total noob.As an example, playing as Center, it is impossible to get rebounds vs. some pay-centers, even with the perfect timing.  If you walk into them they just push you away automatically and you stumble backwards, for example. So no chance of even getting close to the hoop.Also there are chars that grant you a +40 stats boost that you can assign as you wish. And that is A LOT!So if you level up, you get +2 stats per level. so These speciial chars have a 20 level advantage over you statswise. This just can not be beaten. It is like playing a level 1 vs. level 20 char ... or 10 vs. 30 and so on.This is just very very frustrating and unfair.I really like the game, but I do not see a point in spending 10 bucks on chars I don't want to play because the P2W system forces me to. And then ... I don't think it is entertaining pounding normal chars with my pay chars, because they have no chance. There is no challenge in that and it would be unrewarding and boring. At least for me.So one good thing is, the game offers a newby channel. There is a normalchannel for levels 1-11 and a newby channel 1-11. You can only get into the newby channel if you did not level a char past level 11. While I was in there, it was the most fun and the best times. Why, because almost noone had those imba chars there.once you move to the normal channel or past level 12 ... you encounter a pay char in what feels like 2/3 of the games. If you are ""lucky"" you get that guy/gal on your team ... easy mode. If you are even unluckyer, it is your direct opponent. If you quit the game, you do not get the rewards ... so you just get pounded for another 5 minutes. I always try to compete ... which in the end just makes it more frustrating. And now brings me to the point where I uninstall the game and move on.			"

												For a free to play basketball game. I recommend this. It is a mixture of different elements in the basketball game. The game makes 3v3 a challenge that you have to overcome using skills and strategy to make a basket and if you successfully make a basket you can humiliate your opponent with a taunt. Not to mension you can also customize your character and show off while wearing the latest trend. Well develop game. I recommend this game to people who love not only basketball but for people who are looking for enhance in the basketball game.			"

												This is by far the greatest sports game that I have played that is free. The game runs smoothly and the graphics are fine. This game is a 3v3 street basketball game (as shown in the title) that allows you to create your own player. Although you can't change your character's actual body appearance, you can change their clothing, hair style, hats, earings, etc. You can develop your charcter however you want by selecting which attributes you want to upgrade and what skills you want on your player. There are some clothing and characters you can't unlock unless you have money, but other than that everything else is free. It would be certainly worth your time to try this game out.			"

												i would not recommend this game if you want a basketball simulator. this game isn't realistic, the special character (especially the newest) somehow has this ""magical"" abilities (not making this up, look at my hours on record) that makes them better.also the worst community i've ever seen, you could made the best performance you've ever done, and then messed up once that made u lose, you'll be blamed. And the worst part of it, they'll announce your nickname saying like ""kick this ""username"" he's noob"".this game is glitchy and lags a lot, the loading screen is so long and sometimes it crashed.the only thing that keeps me playing is it's free to play (i love basketball), they keep making interesting events (lately they've been giving free SPCs) and it's kinda challenging. It's better than Freestyle 1 in shops and movement.5/10			"

Product received for free
												I have put a lot, and I mean A LOT of time into this game, I've been playing it for over a year so I think I've got enough knowledge about this game to finally review/talk it. First, I would like to say that I have not spent a single penny on this game, not because I don't want to support it, but because I'm still a student with no job, so this will all be how it goes from a £0 experience. Now, this game is really fun, it has 3 a side street basketball where you play with people online, you can choose one of 8 positions (5 main ones plus 3 special positions which makes the game a lot more fun) I have dabbled in each class, the best for me being a Short Forward and a Swing Man. It has a lot of skills in the game, each class getting a different set depending on their role, but also allowing them to extend what they can do, for example, my main SF is also really good at passing and assisting like a Point Guard. You unlock these as you level up your separate characters, skills do not transfer between characters so every time you make a new one it will be like starting over again. Something else that doesn't go between characters is your inventory (Unless it's a character coupon) so everything you get with a character can't be used with another, which is really good as you can't make a new character but give them clothes or cards that a level 50 (Max level) character would use. What does go between characters is points and money (Points being things you get after a game and money being what you buy with real money) so you may be able to buy a skill (which use regular points) as soon as you unlock it instead of having to wait for you to get more money. What also is between characters would be sponsors (Being exp, points and VIP) which gives you a boost in what you get after a match. You can get these by either buying them or getting them dropped through one of the many events that take place. The main downside to this game is that I live in England but my friend who I play with lives in America, meaning that if we decide to play together, one of us will have to sacrifice some ping to go to the other server, luckily the account goes between severs so I can play in Europe server with my characters while not playing with my friend and level them up.All in all, this game is really fun and I recommend it to anyone that wants a basketball game to play with friends but doesn’t have a lot of money, but you can always spend money if you want. You can always win if you are good enough, so just practice and have fun! "

												Good f2p game. I use it when I want some casual PVP.+ Game promotes teamplay. Pick'n'rolls, open threes, big guys spreading the floor, it's all there, and you actually get this nice feeling like in RL ball game when team play goes well.+ Nice position differences give you different angles of gameplay (don't play C or PF if your ping is high, you will suck at rebounding)+ Real money needed only if you really decided to go hardcore and need those extra skill slots.So if you like basketball and you're okay with this comix graphic style you should give this game a try.

												A good sports game must have fluent animations (or at least ""feel"" fluent) and tight gameplay in general. The problem is that everything is tight to the point of feeling stiff and the animations are clunky as all hell. Not to mention that dispite it being a PC game, it does not use the mouse and instead uses the arrow keys to move. THE ARROW KEYS. Whatever is included in the controls right now could have easilly been replaced with proper WASD and left/right click bindings. You might be able to rebind them, maybe, I didn't really care enough to notice.Anyway, animations; good lord they are terrible. You run like the floor is ice, kind of hovering in place even though you are clearly taking a step forward. Trying to steal is pretty much impossible. Even the AI which is better than the average player can't steal.At least the game has some nice music and it looks okay. Though good luck seeing what character is on the screen. They kind of get lost in the chaos of black lines around everyone.Also the UI is terrible and the tutorial is laughable..			"

												This game was created to spread the idea of communism and I am not falling for it. Back in the 40s Mao Se Tung created this game to try to spread and infect the world with communism. He used the domino tactic and started the Vietnam war. China ended up suceeding in the spread to communism and even infected a U.S president John Franklin Kennedy. John Kennedy was a communism; who was implanted in the United States to transform the U.S into a communist state so we all had to give up our wages. Thank god for the hero LBJ who arranged his assassination and stopped him from destroying black supremacy, and the group called The Black Panthers. Most of the citizens dont know this story but here I am telling you. I used to work in the CIA and im retired now and I was involved with the Bay of the Pig Invasion. I was onto Kennedy from the start and knew everything he was doing like almost faking an attack of Cubans for reason to invade. People dont know this but Kennedy is an alien from Boötes I galaxy. He was sent here by his father Pagi Wqyz Mofi the leader of Crak Ek Efikupi and he was found in a space pod near Ulyanovsk and thats when the Russians raised him to become the leader of the United States.

												UPDATED REVIEW (07/07/15) :------------------------------------------------------About the games flaws;This game includes 2 different game :)a) before level 40, easy enjoyable, you can be Kobe, Lebron (you think so :)b) after level 40 when you face the real players including very high skill guys, very good teams, very heavy pay to win guys. You will be shocked after playing against these guys, you will think they are cheating, you will be frustrated, may be you will quit playing the game. Now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point.*  before level 40 this game may seem easy, but it is not. So after becoming level 40 and even being  a level 50, with good piece of equipment, you are so weak. (Put aside the P2W equipment, cards which some of the cards you can aquire with in game currency and events, but the best clothes are time limited, so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent.) The real problem YOU STILL HAVE NO IDEA about this game. Passing at the right time, finding the free teammate, when to fake, when to drive, when to shoot, All of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience. Average player needs thousands of games to be a competetive ""level 50"", and for each different position you still need additional experience.* You need a good team, or a good crew. And the friendship mechanics, crew mechanics are awful in this game. So basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo.* You find a good guy, he knows about this game, so you be friends. But only with that position, you have no idea about his other chars. At some point you have 5 chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game. So there SHOULD be a main CHAR NAME, so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars.* The Crew Function ( Basicly your TEAM, CLAN,...) , totally awful, as a crew master, you have so limited options. You can not classify, sort, you can do nothing usefull. You can only delegate managers, accept players, or kick players out of crew. You have to spend enormous time to have a good crew, you have to know each player well, that is not practicable. YOU MUST HAVE (as a crew master) ability to see player stats, I dont mean attribs, but total stats or monthly stats, as you can see yours. I think you can not even see the level of your crew members (LOL), you can see this during their application only. You can not see inactive players, as you can not sort anything. YOU CAN NOT assaign them titles like, ROOKIE, VETERAN, PRO or whatsoever to classify them, which is a must in a serious clan, crew based mmo.* The games lottery system, prize system so rigged. Lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like 100 points or even blank. If the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items IT IS OKAY. But you see the WHEEL OF FORTUNE for example, there is lets say 24 pieces, 1 of them is 100 points (smallest prize), you turn it 10 times and 5 times you get 100 points, come on this is BS! than put more piece and increase number of 100 points. This is like  slot machines with cheating mechanisms, casino wins all the time :)* Information given by the game, about almost everthing is SO SMALL. Like 3 point attribute, 3 point success rate, which one is what ??? Which one includes what, which is better ? NO INFO ! What about Tussle, who needs tussle , what is that, ??? So you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need, because you have no idea.* There should be some graphical improvements like antialias may be?* There should be optimisation of network code. Still we have disconnects from match loading screens, match would not start for multiple tiries. Some lags which affects gameplay, a player 3 meters left of you can block you with the help of Mr.Spock with a teleportation.So final state of the game : Pros:+ Still Great gameplay+ Seems like devs are listening players after steam+ Some of the problems are sorted out after steam release+ Old the pros are valid from first reviewCons:- Still P2W.- Big gap after level 40 with high levels, gap with experienced or/and p2w players. - Awful friendship interface, lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comms.- Awful Crew system.- Flawed lottery system.- Lack of information about the game (stats,...)- Need improved graphics.- Need better network code.OLD REVIEW:---------------------------------I have been playing this game during OBT. I have 1 level 50 SF, lvl 36 C, lvl 27 SG, lvl 5 PF. Also I had played FS1 long time ago. So do not mind the steam play time.First things first, this game is PAY TO WIN (P2W). With earned points you can purchase items, which will give you around +5 attrib, but if you purchase item with real money you can go up to +13 or even +18 (so this is the pay to win aspect of the game) (Also there is the toy thing which can be P2W)(you will encounter PG who can steal all your balls, really annoying, a balance issue much more than P2W although P2W makes them so strong at stealing)Aside from this, I definitely recommend this game, because it is SO MUCH FUN. You can level up to level 50 (final), and build a good player, you can compete with others (wallet warriors). You can compete with others by Team PLAY and SKILL.So if you have a good team, crew, friends. YES YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME.IF you like basketball, yes you will enjoy this game. BEWARE you can NOT be a jordan or kobe, trying so will gain you only FRUSTRATION. You need team play, if you are high level, with good items and skills, yes you can be KOBE :) , MJ not so sure :))PRO+ Nice graphics+ Basketball online at best+ 3 divisions according to your level, so you dont get smashed by high levels+ If you understand the game and be a team player, SUPER FUNCONS- P2W- Need somehow good ping- OBT players can be a bit unfriendly ( they do not have the patience for rookies, noobs)- Difficult to understand core game mechanics for a newbei (including cards, toys and GAMEPLAY)*- After steam release, game is experiencing lag which I have encountered 1 in a 50 games series during OBT. So this is an issue now.* A major con was the low player base, I hope it will change with steam, this game deserves it.OVERALL: 7.5/10  ( a great game, if it was not P2W, it would be a 9 )YES I DO RECOMMEND, no body is perfect :) BTW I see most of negative reviews is due to absence of SEA server ( so this guys want this game to fail, instead of earning money and starting a sea server)			"

												Seems to be a neat little game, easy to pick up, hard to master. Game works on teambase, meaning you have to work out who is going for who, and find a playstyle that suits you and the team. Like, do you want to be a tall guy for good defense. Or a fast guy that makes it easier to get the the ball passed at you. The crowd cheering and yelling, combined with the taunting you can do, Makes the competitve feeling pretty good. Getting you either ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and frustrated or satisfied to see them getting owned. If you like basketball games its deffinetly worth a try. If you don't, but like teambased sports, still worth a try. If your not interested in sports at all, then well... what are you doing here?

												Gameplay is really fun and competitive, especially when the team is working together even though it's a ""PUG"". only downside is asia server is currently unstable and lag alot, which makes alot of asia player to play in North America server instead. Though it doesn't affect too much but if you're using a Center or PF position the ping matters. =.=Overall a good game and being able to swag out your character makes it even better. I made a big black guy, gave him Blonde hair and slapped on a pair of fancy glasses and then named him FatJ. ♥♥♥♥♥ He's Fabulous, Don't judge.			"

												I'm not a sports fan whatsoever, apart from playing the occasional WWE video game every so often, I like to keep to other games, but this game has surprised me and made me a tad bit interested in basketball.After playing a few matches, I can say this is a pretty competent free-to-play game on Steam which can safely join the ranks of games like Warframe and Team Fortress 2. Graphically, it's not the best looking game but it has a distinct art style which you don't see in many free-to-play games, which I have to give them props for.Surprisingly a really fun game.Definitely pick this up if you're a sports fan or not, you should still get some enjoyment out of this!

												If you can get past the server issues the game is pretty good and has a large following.  The interface is a bit confusing and I still have no clue what some of the stuff does or what I should do with it but it's basketball and it's street basketball and that makes it a 10/10 for me.UPDATE:Well I have been playing a lot of team matches lately and I can say without a doubt the game is 150% P2W.  We played a team of bought players and we could not touch them, one guy scored all the points with a total of 36 points and they were all 3 pointers with NO misses at all.  I am done with this game.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing terrible. This game is literally, NBA 2K games with a Play-Pay 2 Win concept. The gameplay is God awful, has a lot of bugs which the devs will not even look into fixing; characters you pay to unlock have extra training points which gain you  an advantage over the other players who beat their asses to level up by playing with un-♥♥♥♥ing-beatable opponents, by the way they also implemented new positions so now you can play as multiple positions in one character! So there is no meaning of PGs or Cs anymore, SWs/CTs/DGs and other characters make up for ALL of the original positions. The skill system is also really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, they make you pay tons of credits that range from 2000 to tens of thousands but you gain only 75-120 per match if you don't have VIP or the other boosters. Oh by the way, YOU CAN PAY ACTUAL MONEY TO UNLOCK SKILL SLOTS. Another thing to point on, you can get special abilities added to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COSTUMES. These can be pass/steal/intercept etc. boosters and can also make you AVOID F*CKING SCREENS AND BLOCKS. ""Oh, did you try to block that last minute shot? MAYBE I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO BLOCK THAT."" There is also a ""card system"", which you can put different cards that boost your abilities by a bit in 3 different slots; offense, defense and talent. If you try to upgrade a card, you need to have 2 or more spray depending on the level of the card. You rarely get spray from boxes and gifts, and there is no way to get more other than, you guessed it, putting more credits to buy more spray which is damn expensive. By the way, I'm not somebody who played the game for a minute and left. I'm level 30, I played it enough to know what the minor and major issues this game has.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. If you want to pour cash into the game to wreck newbies, fine. Go with it. Just keep in mind that you won't be able to progress really quickly unless you spend money.			"

												Best game in history. Every aspect of it screams perfection. When you first open up this beautiful masterpiece, you are immersed in the environment by means of its superlative soundtrack, it drowns out all other thought and just fuels the roaring fire that is the desire to play this game. When trying to navigate the menus, you are bombarded by its puzzle-like nature, making the time when you actually figure out what to do so magical. The character create screen prohibits the majority of names which allow one's creativity to shine, not only this, but the process itself is complex, no tips are given which proves it to be not for the faint of heart. The gameplay is unlike that of any other game I have experienced in my recently unfulfilled life, every aspect is flawless from the minimal controls to the minute amount of dialogue, which permits the focus on the important part; landing slamming dunks. Being immersed in a 200 ping world makes every move count which just adds to its brilliance. For such perfection to be free of cost is unimaginable, as there is not a price in the world high enough which would stop me from enjoying it. 420/69.			"

												So I am asuming you're one of those people that saw this game and thought ""Oh that looks cool to play with friends and have a bit of fun!""Well if you are one of those people. Stop. Stop thinking that right now, if you honestly like this game and have played it before and can handle the terrible controls and stupid commentary and foolish music choice then CONGRATS! You are the spawn of Satan and everything un-holy. BUT if you are a first timer and have NEVER played this before thinking it looked fun. Well it's not, it's a big pile of steaming crap, sat on your doorstep ready for you to un-knowingly stand on it when you step outside your door. Then the smell just lingers like a virus and honestly you regret all the decisions you have made in your life and want to go back to the womb and start over.3/10   The 3 is only there to make the creators feel good about themselves in some sort of way.

												IDK what it is, but this game has always been the most fun I had compared to even the 2k series, Live or any other basketball game out there. It is not super realistic, but it has so many moves and ways to customize a player that you build from the ground up. Its an RPG at the same time as being a great sports game. You feel like it is you at a park playing when you control your character, just very fun, very well done. The old freestyle 1 was great and now I am enjoying this sequel.+ RPG style progression mixed with sports+ Lots of cool skills to learn as you lvl up & items to equip for originality+ Great competition online vs. others & team work game- Pay to Win as you can purchase items to boost stats and buy special characters with money too- Ping is very important so if you are on East coast you cant rebound/block guys with lower ping in the west very easily, they beat you to the jump.- The Devs don't care much about their playerbase. Windows 10 took 4 months to get patched in, the only game I had trouble with and they knew about it 4 months too. No compensation or even a sorry to us.If they fixed ping and took away the P2W aspects it would be a perfect street ball game, how it is now, its a 6/10, but still recommend it to all bball fans.

												With solid, fast paced gameplay and an excellent presentation that's easily the best the series has ever had, Freestyle 2: Streetbasketball continues its strong pedigree of great basketball. While the presentation holds down the fort, the inclusion of the Street Today and My Player modes, as well as the addition of the developmental leagues make an already good title even better. While the technical issues, such as the slowdown and the legacy problems with the AI and shooting are dismaying, they don't completely destroy the on-court experience, which is still strong enough to allow FreeStyle to hold the basketball crown for yet another year.

												Very good game (isn't pay 2 win) and even after some hours you're still amazed of what you can do. You can buy almost every item with in game money and if it needs to be bought with real money, you can get it from a ig ball drop. No problem with crashes or some and a game only takes 5 min max. I really do recommend this game if you can't buy the NBA2k games and you want a good and amazing basketball game. =)			"

												Fun game, but not much ability to customize. You have to pay, and its heavily based on lootcrate systems like most things. You basically have 4 moves on offense and 4 moves on defense. Slow load times, and I don't like the lobby system. It appears there are only one game or 2 at a time. The game needs a lot of cleaning up that they probably won't do. Also steals don't seem quite on the money. It is fun though. Just has its flaws. I wish there was a better alternative.			"

One problem I have with the game is that sometimes people with crappy connection will join your room, and then your whole team can't play any games. The 'evict people from your court' feature makes up for this though. It's a good game and I'll continue playing it			"

												This game was nothing like I thought it was gonna be. I thought this game was gonna at least feel a little bit realistic. This game just feels awful to play. The character movements are clunky and the shooting is awful. Any character can shoot pretty much anywhere and the controls are horrible. I can literally shoot 3s with big centers.			"

												Forget about the slight worry of pay to win at higher levels, this game is an absolute blast that has snuck under the radar for me for far too long. I wish I had heard about this little gem years ago.This game is by FAR the most competetive (and fun) 3v3 game you can play, even if you don't like basketball!Each position in basketball is realized, and they each have a very specific role that they play. The game also scratched the RPG player in me by letting the user customize their player with stat points they get as they level up. Tired of having that 3-point shot always miss as a point guard? Throw some stat points into your 3-point shot to help you out.  My only negatives are navigating the menu, some long initital loading times, being able to PURCHASE stat points, and the the many redundant mini games to get in game currency and items. You could also fare well to turn the music off as well :)Grab some buddies and hoop it up! You won't regret it.Another big plus! This game has controller support!!!!!			"

												The game has improved a lot since it came out in the early 2000's but the downside of this game in the present time is the inequality of normal player vs cash-spending players. People playing with special characters have far more attribute and skill advantage than of an average player with the same character level. Overall, game is good but should be played with friends with mics, teamwork and decision making is definitely needed in this game. Would rate this game 6.5/10			"

												Well this game is pretty good but...There are some issues. It being focused on Team play mainly is pretty good but you know, you get those ball hogs that don't pass when you're open... facepalm. Anyway this game is good with 2 other friends, other than that there isn't more problems, its a great and fun game, pretty grind fested BUT though it might be grindy its still very enjoyable and not that boring. The only MASSIVE issue I have other than the team mates which isn't so bad is the lag. And its pretty dang big. I live in Australia so I have to play on the Asian servers since I get the best ping. I thought having 170 ping was good, nope. If you have over like 80 ping you can barely do good. Well I am not to sure about under 100 ping but over 100 its horrible. You get blocked on your shot all the time, even if you're open for a split second, INSTANT block EVEN THOUGH you shouldn't of been blocked. Same goes for rebounding, person has better ping they'll get it.So in the end its a great game but the ping and teammates is the only horrible part. PLEASE GET AN OCEANIC SERVER! "

												We need full court please!!! Perhaps while updating/ adding this feature,  stamina could probably be increased due to more consumption. Also, we need voice communications, since a lot of players dont know eachother and arent able to communicate properly (i.e spamming pass or alley-oop). One final thought behind updating Freestyle 2: Street Basketball is that there should be more channels for each rank, (i.e rookie, major, pro). This game has proved to be a bit more fun than some games I've played in the past and hope that this game will continue to update so that reviews such as this, will become more common.			"

												After getting up to lvl 15, I have only this to say.Fun game, try it, but never, EVER... Try to block me.Your ankles will be broken.*REAL REVIEW*Don't ge me wrong. This game isn't your average Basketball game *cough 2K13-15 cough*So If you are not used to the way the controls are set up, It's a game where the mouse is not at all required during a match. It would be useful to use the scroll as a shoot/hold button. But this game does have VERY LITTLE flaws. One flaw is the servers when in a 3V3. And other is the way when ever someone drives and you just see this blur. Oh wait... it's call KISS MY FAST! To be honest, If this was on all consoles *INCLUDING WII U, STOP DENYING* It would be another game to have fun with the family. And if you're black...""AWW COME ON MAN! YOUR CENTER STRAIGHT GOALTENDING LIKE A ♥♥♥♥♥ DAWG!""There is no reason anyone shouldn't be enjoying this game. If you don't have it, I have only one question for you:Can you hoop?			"

												Forget about the slight worry of pay to win at higher levels, this game is an absolute blast that has snuck under the radar for me for far too long. I wish I had heard about this little gem years ago.This game is by FAR the most competetive (and fun) 3v3 game you can play, even if you don't like basketball!Each position in basketball is realized, and they each have a very specific role that they play. The game also scratched the RPG player in me by letting the user customize their player with stat points they get as they level up. Tired of having that 3-point shot always miss as a point guard? Throw some stat points into your 3-point shot to help you out.  My only negatives are navigating the menu, some long initital loading times, being able to PURCHASE stat points, and the the many redundant mini games to get in game currency and items. You could also fare well to turn the music off as well :)Grab some buddies and hoop it up! You won't regret it.Another big plus! This game has controller support!!!!!			"

												The game has improved a lot since it came out in the early 2000's but the downside of this game in the present time is the inequality of normal player vs cash-spending players. People playing with special characters have far more attribute and skill advantage than of an average player with the same character level. Overall, game is good but should be played with friends with mics, teamwork and decision making is definitely needed in this game. Would rate this game 6.5/10			"

												Nice game ... pay to win ?!  I have almost 1.000 hours in these game.I have just 2 max lvl characters ( lvl 50 ) and that cuz I play only with PG , I have a lvl 50 SG and PG the SG its a normal character , he was the first lvl 50 character i make. When i make my SG lvl 50 Freestyle2: Street Basketball give me a SPC cuppon ( Specia character , u can pay for it too , i make my PG).  When Ace of Wulin team appeared was an event with a rulette ( something like that ) and I was lucky and I get a SPC ( I got my sf cloud ).  On Freestyle2: Street Basketball 2nd anniversary I get a free SPC from Noble( gift for all players ( Ty Freestyle2: Street Basketball ♥) ) I make a C ( Center ).  And these week I make king of Steal ( title ) on my pg and I get 10 green basketballs to open , I go to open them and guess what ... I got other SPC and I make a SG cuz i wanted to buy a SPC sg but now i win it.  Why i keep playing Freestyle2: Street Basketball ???-Great Updates.-Every time events.-Bugs ? Press F9 ( if u are in FreeRoom ).-Replay value.  Bad thinks about Freestyle2: Street Basketball ???-If u want to be a good rebounder u need good PING.-If u want to start playing these game now its hard cuz good players everywhere.  Freestyle2: Street Basketball Its my favorite game I bought CS:GO but Freestyle2: Street Basketball its better in my opinion . So if u want to play these game i recommend you to do it , u have a lot of content and weekly Updates and NOT pay to win ... skill to win.I love FreeStyle and FreeStyle community ( and DBLL Don't judge me :D )   Main name YoALEXpg50 ( I'm just good not pro :) )  Sorry for my English I'm from romania.

												I young friend of mine begged me to install this so I gave it a go.It is terrible, right from the start with the ear-assaulting garbage music, to the incredibly frustrating and unintuitive menu and character selection screen that make you want to turn the thing off immediately.  Here is a little message for the developers: if your player selects some game mode (for me it was: tutorial) and wishes to exit that game mode, you should let them do that.  Typically this occurs by pressing ESC key to get to a menu.  In freestyle basketball you will not receive this courtesy, if you decide you want out, you are going to have to complete that tutorial.I somehow knew it was going to happen, but this was by far the worst gaming experience I have had in years.  There are plenty of decent free-to-play games out there.  This is not one of them.			"

												It's a good sport game, interface is quite standard and easy to grasp, has some special movements that will need some training to master them so its not too easy to learn. You need your time to master just 1 position, and a lot more if you plan to master all 5 positions.Big downside is game is full of ""im-too-pro-to-play-with-you"", new players are harassed, bullied, and insulted in 1/2 of the games (in the rookie channel), 9/10 in pro channel (that you will reach after just 1-2 weeks of play).You may find this 1/1000 person that may help you and give hints about how to get better, but its a rare event (i have found like 2 people in 1 month).So if you are a rager and don't mind at all the ""standard internet game community"" education level there's some fun here. If you have some minimal education or don't have the patience to deal with raging kids 24/7 you may aswell skip the trouble of playing.Plus the P2W side is strong. Don't expect to win any game against a team of full stuffed cash heavy players, unless you are one of them.			"

												Well this game is pretty good but...There are some issues. It being focused on Team play mainly is pretty good but you know, you get those ball hogs that don't pass when you're open... facepalm. Anyway this game is good with 2 other friends, other than that there isn't more problems, its a great and fun game, pretty grind fested BUT though it might be grindy its still very enjoyable and not that boring. The only MASSIVE issue I have other than the team mates which isn't so bad is the lag. And its pretty dang big. I live in Australia so I have to play on the Asian servers since I get the best ping. I thought having 170 ping was good, nope. If you have over like 80 ping you can barely do good. Well I am not to sure about under 100 ping but over 100 its horrible. You get blocked on your shot all the time, even if you're open for a split second, INSTANT block EVEN THOUGH you shouldn't of been blocked. Same goes for rebounding, person has better ping they'll get it.So in the end its a great game but the ping and teammates is the only horrible part. PLEASE GET AN OCEANIC SERVER! "

												The art style, gameplay, graphics and sound are all fantastic. There is a lot of rubbish to endure if you wish to enjoy them though. Amazing potential ruined by clunky free 2 play interface, level up system and no joy pad support. I want this exact game but with a season mode, offline multiplayer, no level up system and a $15 price tag instead of the free2play sludge getting in the way. Would be great if they just made a game and nothing else. I'll pay in dollars.  "

												Played the game for almost two hours with two friends while having no idea how to do anything or even how to navigate the menus. Got crushed by the CPU players time and time again before getting our first victory. The spirit of Shaq took over me and I felt STREET af. Slam dunk after slam dunk I felt more empowered and precision 3-pointers were shot like a machinegun. Then we never played the game again because it was buggy as hell at the time. 10/10, get STREET.			"

												I think Freestyle Street Basketball has a potential chance to be a popular game. The idea is solid, the graphics and overall style are great and the gameplay is pretty fun. But the horrible players you have to get through to eventually play with the decent ones will turn people away and the lag will push on.			"
