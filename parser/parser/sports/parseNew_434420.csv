												Biggest reason not to buy: http://www.ultraimg.com/image/xtU3The dev (shortly pre-release) deleted all negative posts and (perma-)banned EVERYONE outing negative critism. Even when they did adhere to the Steam guidelines.The developer also attempts to hide it and lies about it, saying that he welcomes criticicsm: http://www.ultraimg.com/image/xtU5Pros- It has Steam achievements.- It has trading cards.- Erm... It has half naked girls?Cons (first version of game)- Maps are extremely poorly made. The developer is certainly not anywhere near an experienced RPG Maker user. See also this example to illustrate that the developer did not even spend 10 minutes on his maps: http://www.ultraimg.com/image/xtU6- Around 98% default graphics where used. If you include the unused files that were shipped with this game, over 99%. No(t much) money was spend on this game aside from some character busts and 1 single custom battle background and maybe some free music.- I explored the game-folder because I was kind of surprised why this is over 300MB. Seems the dev did not even bother to clean up the project. It has LOTS AND LOTS of unused files... Also no proper compression and no proper file-formats used. All just default.- Combat is basic. Just some plugins from other people thrown together. Looks half finished, unbalanced and feels static. Also the enemies you encounter all came default with RPG Maker. The dev did not even bother to create or adjust the enemies himself. Because that would actually take a few hours of time...- Most of the music is also default. I have heard it a 100x before in other games. But not all.- The prologue does not have a background it's just a black screen. This could be okay in some cases but not here. Also it's unskippable, It can be speed up a tiny bit though. It also has spelling mistakes. And the rest of the game also has plenty of spelling mistakes.- Using names like Kami (Japanese for god)... Well, it beats Kitsune I guess.- Lots of events where SFX seem absent or may have been forgotten.- Didn't use any different dialog-backgrounds to indicate that people are thinking instead of speaking.- Half the positive reviews here of questionable nature. The only review that has a lot of (up)votes is a negative one. Some of those people that claim this game is awesome have logged 0.5 hours. Then thereafter they played many other games instead.Also people who can't find a single positive point aside from ""I really dig the music"" and still upvote the game. Not to mention their indirect ties sometimes to the developer. It all looks of very 'questionable' nature.- Menu is 100% default. Just like the rest of the game it's very minimalistic and it feels as if it was made in just 7 days time.- Some maps allow you to exit by touching the edge of the map while other maps require you to use the markers.  Sometimes the same area has sections where you can do this and sections where you can't do this. This inconsistency is insanely annoying and extremely bad game design. You can clearly see this in the 2nd area (forest south west of the starting town) where this happens randomly everywhere.- Random texts appear telling you where to go so now and then. There is often no story behind it at all. And you better not forget it because the game won't tell you twice.- It goes on sale for 40% off right upon release.- The story is AWFUL. You visit your mom's grave ""Hey mom"". Then shortly after ""I better get back to the village"". Why? Because the dev did not include a reason for you to go to places where he wants you to go. This goes on and on.- I can't name my characters. I can't even name my characters in a RPG Maker game?- Etc. etc. etc. You get the idea.And this is where I stopped playing.A shameful game, with an even more shameful dev. Shame on both for releasing such a poorly made game. And shame on Steam for allowing this. Maybe I should also release games like these. Maybe like 2/week or so and ask 2 bucks for them with a perma 50% discount and some half naked content to attract some attention.And those reviewers claiming that it is only a few bucks, it's a few bucks totally wasted and spend on a developer that does not deserve it.The dev told me that the reason the game is still good despite all the 'lies' I wrote in my review: ""But it's only like 1$""...UPDATE: My response to the developers response to this review:Every perspective is biased, lets not pretend there is some magical thing called a 100% objective review.As a developer of the game you're also heavily biased, to all the faults and you ignore the truths (which I can proof and some I even did proof) of my review. But you keep denying them and keep calling us liars.If you really want to convince the critics, just address the arguments on its face. Attacking me instead of the review/criticism all the time. Except the majority seem to agree with me not you.Maybe come back with actual substance... Addressing the issues instead of attacking your (potential) players it's simply not cool. Perhaps you could fix the mistakes in your maps, improve the things we pointed out, reverse the bans and apologize and I will be so honest to rewrite my review then. Which, you can not delete&ban, only Steam can and Steam does not believe I violate any rules/guidelines.I mean Silver only ever played Chosen for 20 minutes, after already telling us how terrible it was.While my review has extremely low game hours, so did a lot of positive reviews, so why not criticize and possibly ban them just as much as me? Or is it because they agree with you?Graphics&maps are a ""visual"" experience, it requires no gametime to make a judgement based on it, I can watch a gameplay walkthrough and still have an opinon of the developers mapping skills and level of polish.Clearly though Silver knew exactly how long it took to make the maps that he/she had not even seen yet.And like I said many times before: I did see it before I criticized it in the screenshots/video YOU SUPPLIED pre-release and I showed you proof in the other review already. But keep saying it often enough maybe someone will believe you...Regarding the ban reasons:First reason: ""crazy criticism & violating Steams guidelines"". Note that I did NOT violate Steam's Guidelines (yes I wrote Steam support about it). Later he changed it to ""You have been banned because you criticized my game without even seeing it"". But again, I did see it on the screenshots and on the demo video the devs SUPPLIED pre-release and ended up (unaltered&unpolished) into the final version.Also other people got banned for the same criticism. Later he changed the real ban reason to along the lines of: ""I thought that you're another developer who is jealous of my work trying to make me look bad""... If anyone is jealous of this work... Then that person must have a hard time finding a job in the game industry for sure.Then he proves even more of what an amateur he is by publicly arguing with banned users in a review (another review, not this one). And when I complained about spelling mistakes he said something along the lines of ""but your review does too""... I never in my life saw a developer respond like that.A prologue should NEVER have spelling mistakes, since that is the first impression of your writing they get, and will demonstrate the judgement they will be biased in. But to shift blame like that is a new low that I have never seen before.			"

My Impression:I usually steer clear of RPG maker games, but I was interested in the fact the description compared it to Chrono Trigger. It is nothing like Chrono Trigger. It's a very generic JRPG with a generic storyline. I beat the game with all the achievements in 4 hours, including the hidden items.Positive:+ Character art is pretty nice, not sure it's original (also, there's no nudity like the tags suggest)+ RPG maker combat is always nice, its a throwback to the past+ It was just long enough that I finished it without saying this game is just too bad+ Music was pretty decent+ Hidden ""quests"" if you want to call them that add something nice+ Trading cards with nice backgroundsCons:- A lot of bugs, maps you go up into will start you at the top for instance. Ultimate weapons are not named correctly. Balancing issues caused by not testing enough. Another bug is that some of the bosses don't disappear and you can re-fight them over and over again, and one of them you can accidently refight just based on the positioning of the objects.- Very linear- Pay attention to where you are supposed to go, they mention it once after each major event, easy to get lost- Story is pretty genericBelow Average Game: 4/10I got the game for 40% off, and I probably would recommend it at <$1.00 to anyone that wants to beat a 4-5 hour generic JRPG.

												I played this game for half an hour, and I actually may return to it to be honest. However, to be clear, the only reason I would go back to it because it is hilarious. That is, hilariously bad. It'd almost be a parody of stereotypical JRPGs if it didn't take itself so seriously. And the bugs. Just in the first half hour, without trying to find them, I saw at least three graphical errors and an NPC that gave me speech based on events that had not happened yet. I paid less than a dollar for this game, and that's all it's worth. I've used RPG maker, even with just the base program you can do much better than this. Buy it on sale if you want to laugh at the cliches, but otherwise steer clear.			"

												Even if you ignore the accusations of censorship being thrown at this game's developer, it's really not worth playing. The plot is cliched as hell and ends on a cliffhanger in a blatant attempt to hook the player in for a sequel, the writing is full of mistakes and feels extremely unnatural, the game itself is very short and very easy (I beat it in less than 3 hours even after doing every single side quest), and all of the art and sound for the game aside from the character busts comes straight out of the default set of assets that comes with RPG Maker VX Ace.Oh, and there's also a bug that makes you fight a boss all over again if you trigger it.

												Oh dear. I knew it was a risk buying a game with mixed reviews, however cheap- but this RPG takes the biscuit.Where do I begin? I have only played this poor excuse for a game for half an hour and have already been thrown from my gameplay back to the main menu twice, with no way of continuing.The artwork is pretty shoddy- I think the purpose of this game was to get as much cold-nipple look in as possible? The artwork for enemies during battle is laughable- it looks as if they've been torn from a clipart database, any form of animation for these things is also out of the question.Battle UI is clunky- I couldn't see if there was a way to even see enemy health, but perhaps I was missing that somewhere? The size of the sprites is puny compared to the enemy images also- the soldiers are suddenly 10x taller than you when you are battling them. Even the achievement art is indistinguishable from one to another.More complaints- spelling mistakes here there and everywhere, dialogue is stiff and unnatural.... everything seems forced and half arsed. To put it bluntly in the time I was playing this, it showed itself to be one of the most bland, copy-paste games I can even imagine. A clever marketing plan- spend so little time on an empty unpolished game, then charge pennies for it in the sales.... people will buy in the sale frenzy without even thinking about it- and all those pennies add up eventually. How did this unplayable mess make it on to Steam, I don't even know. Smh.Do not buy unless you want cheap achievements. I feel this is the only redeeming quality of this game. I will probably play again to 100% it myself, but I really wish I'd spent the money on a Freddo bar instead.			"

												To be honest, I was hoping that there'd be more of a game under all the cheesecake, but unfortunately, what's there just isn't very good. It's an RPGMaker-born game, and oh boy, does it show. I think the gratuitous skin is to distract from the fact that this game really, really isn't ready for much of anything resembling launch. It needs more than just a spit-shine; it needs rebalancing so very badly- some of the moves can simply allow you to cheese the game. For example, we'll look at the most egregious example: Serenity's ""Tackle"" skill.Most RPGs have several different status effects- you know, poison, paralyze, slow, etc.- the usual ones that we all know and loathe. Chosen introduces us to a new one: off-balance. Essentially, a target affected by off-balance cannot take another action until they are no longer off-balance, essentially turning them into a punching bag for the duration. It usually wears off after a turn or two, but you can essentially just layer it every single turn if you get lucky enough. It's game-breaking: believe me when I say that nothing in the game is immune to it- not even the final boss. Yes, as long as you keep Serenity alive during the final battle, you stand a darn good chance to just wreck him by abusing the cheezburgers out of her ""Tackle"" skill. The only saving grace is that it requires ten tech points to use, and the only way you can get those is by either attacking the enemy, or being attacked. You get five per successful attack... and, of course Serenity gets two attacks a round right off the bat and, of course, TP is figured per strike rather than per command.It means that, well... you can alternate Tackle every turn with the regular attack and eliminate plenty of difficulty from the game, because ""Tackle"" is the first technique that Serenity learns. You'll have it before you're finished with the first dungeon. Every other technique that she learns is outshined and not even needed. Other abilities are overly costly, others are just useless. You can simply use three abilities aside from regular attacks (Edge's ""Strong Attack"", Serenity's ""Tackle"" and Trinity's ""Aura Blade"" (has a chance to silence the target) along with a decently-sized nuke from Myste) and not use another attack pattern, apart from using Trinity to drop item heals on targets that need it.The game is unfinished- there are missing walls that are not coded in (most observable in Volcano Village- in which there is someone living in a tent, where you can walk past the boundaries of the tent and all over the screen without hitting an invisible wall. The exit was programmed in, the invisible walls were not. The text is making my inner English major throw a fit worthy of my three-year-old niece, and I wholeheartedly say that she could have done a better job on editing the script than whoever was hired to do it. It's full of errors that a run through spellcheck would have caught, and there's no real excuse for something like that.All in all, it appears the dev is hoping that plentiful cheesecake will distract from the myriad of shortcomings, errors and mistakes currently present in the game- while I have nothing against cheesecake, you can't just hide the fact that this game's nowhere near done and really shouldn't have been released in this condition without much more time in development.The only real thing the game has is the cheesecake, and if that doesn't float your particular boat, I honestly can't recommend this game.  I'd pay no more than fifty cents for this clunker of a game- I hope the dev takes note and does better with the next installment and irons out the mistakes and errors.2/10.			"

												This game is too cheaply made to really be worth your time. The story is cookie fodder -- early -- Final Fantasy fare, the chosen hero has to save the world yadda yadda yadda.The only unique feature which tries to set it apart from other RPGMaker games is the cheesecake portraits of female characters, which heavily feature in the store front screenshots.The main problem is easily seen in all the random battles: there is absolutely no art consistency in this game. Backgrounds are pixel paintings, player characters are minute chibi sprites and as for the enemies, they are without exception several times larger than the player sprites and of various differing art styles, ranging from generic slime to highly detailed soldier. Battles use RPGMaker default rules and there isn't even a selection cursor showing just which of the many enemies on screen is 'Soldiers A' and which is 'Soldiers D' -- note the plural.The game text has multiple grammar and spelling errors, and even complete novice errors such as referring to a DESCENDANT of someone as ANCESTOR.Other problems include the complete lack of indicators on sprites that are affected by status impairments such as poisoned, while with player characters there is some indicator in the battle screens, there is no such info for enemies. Combine with the lack of identification of individual enemies and you have to remember which enemy has which status...There is also no health bar for enemies, or even any indication that they may be close to death. Fortunately (?) they are all very easy. Without grinding, I only died once during the entire game, and that was a scripted loss. Even the optional bosses are extremely easy to beat.On top of all that, the game ends on a clfifhanger with a 'to be continued'.All in all, if this were a free RPGMaker game I'd be supportive of it as the game creator does have a good idea of what makes a decent oldschool RPG game, but for a commercial release that is sold for money, I expect more. So I just can't honestly recommend it.			"

												It's glaringly obvious that the bare minimum amount of effort and creativity has gone into this game. It's embarassingly unpolished with graphical errors all over the place and uses inconsistant, mismatching default RPG Maker elements for the mostpart. Gameplay is aggrivating with most ""quests"" having you visit and re-visit the same areas multiple times in order to talk to someone who simply tells you to go somewhere else and talk to someone else.I honestly don't know how I finished it. I'm guessing this has a lot of positive reviews because all the women are barely dressed?			"

												This is a below average RPG Maker game.The game is short and very generic.  The only original art in the whole game appears to be the main character and his three scantily clad companions.  What you see on the store page promo video is all that there is.  The rest of the art is made up of the default RPG Maker assets.  There is no mature content.The game can be completed in under 5 hours and hints that there may be more games coming in this series.  I am not holding my breath.Overall, if you like the art shown on the store page.... if you are going to buy it for those three bikini shots, then you will buy it whether it is a good game or not.  For everyone else that wants to know if it is a good game in its own right?  No, no it is not.It gets one point for each of the scantily clad companions, because that is all this game is.3/10 "

												Well, another RPG Maker game got from a bundle, just to get some trading cards. And I've actually PLAYED it until the end, so... Let's do a quick review.Story: Pretty meh. Nothing to elaborate, things happens pretty fast, characters are bland... 5/10Gameplay: Average RPG Maker gameplay, with some bugs here and there. Nothing new, really. And a few VERY easy puzzles. 3/10Graphics: HALF-NAKED GIRLS OH GOD YES!!1! And that's it. The rest are the default graphics from the engine. The mapping is bad, and nothing new on the graphics too. 2/10Sound: The default soundtrack of RPG Maker is always good to hear. But, nothing new here too. 5/10Final Score: 3.5/10. It would have potential if the whole game didn't looked so rushed to be done, with better explored character development, mapping, and some systems like quests, crafting, or whatever, really!Opnion: This game should be free, maybe as a demo of what the engine could offer... There is a lot of free of those generic RPG games that are actually more interesting... The attention the game has I'm 99% sure is because the anime girls with the body (totally unnecessary) exposed. It's not a good game, but I'm sure it could be worse. Wanna give it a try? Go for it, it's cheap. But you can find better FREE games just googleing ""generic RPG Maker games"".			"

												The enemies are taken straight out of RPG Maker, the cutscenes are boring, the text is boring, the characters have no personality. At the begginging of the game you decide to steal from your mothers grave... yeah... a nice way to start. The combat system taken is out of RPG Maker. The fights are way too easy. You deal 300 to 600 hp enemies, enemies deal 10 to you, 1000 hp. Also girls wear bikini for some reason. Even when fighting. Every 5 seconds you get attacked by some random encounter. Also sometimes you get the message ""Find your way to ..."". Well that's basically the game. Just go through some random labirynths in hope that you can find your goal.			"

I'd give it some slack but considering you can get better RPG Maker games for less, there's just no excuse to be made.Even if it's on sale, don't bother, the ""developers"" just slapped a bunch of pre-made assets together to cheat people out of their money.

												A very, very paint-by-the-numbers kind of RPG. There's just so little going on here. This game has a very low price point, which is the only true saving grace about it, but that's literally it. I suppose I should say that as a first effort, it's not THAT bad, but it's pretty forgettable as a whole. Keep in mind it also ends with a bland cliff hanger and a 'to be continued...' screen, but more attention should have been paid into making this one rather than any intent on going to a sequel. There's not much to recommend.Disappointments about Chosen:1. Possibly the most generic RPG I've ever played. Forgettable non-personality characters with run of the mill anime names (Edge, Serenity, Akuma). Tired order versus chaos storyline. Even the 'twist' at the end is utterly predictable.2. Super easy. I never needed to grind. Enemies, including the special bosses and the final villain, all hit like wet socks. Had decent gear by the end, but not anything great, nor did I need anything better. A quiz at the end of the game has no penalties, you just keep answering different things until you get it right. A few pushing boulder puzzles that I could do in my sleep.3. No character has any personality. They speak a few lines, but they're all honestly interchangable and faceless. Only the main character has anything that can be described as a motivation. Heck, one of the party members even shares the same image as her ruler's full image, except the latter has a dress and a tiara.4. Lack of a navigation system. There's no map feature and if you miss or forget the quick blurb between story events about what direction to go to, good luck. The overworld has limited defining features at best. They're just empty islands with one, occasionally two enterable places at best. I spent more time wandering around between playing sessions trying to figure out where I was supposed to go than anything else.5. The whole experience... it's just lazy. Words running off the screen, with frequent grammar mistakes. Incomplete maps, numerous empty traveling screens with no monsters or anything to do on them. Generic bikini clad party members for quick eyecandy sales. If you want some cheesecake, play Huni Pop, because you won't see much of anything beyond the screen shots above. Numerous NPCs in the last town don't speak whatsoever, unlike ones from previous towns. Oh, and the last area? There's no wandering monsters. In fact, you can pay gold to literally buy experience points. A couple of acceptable points...1. The aforementioned low price point. Mind you, this was also on sale when it came out...2. Music is generally good...? Not certain how much is RPG maker (the game makers use a ton of common RPG maker assets) and how much was custom made, if any.			"

												Lack of Novelty other than the use of alluring characters for marketing purposes,dull and generic storyline.Progress is a straightline with no thrills, puzzles nor surprises.World is small and nothing much to see.Tp system does not accumulate after fights, hence rendering most high end skills unused since you rarely have enough Tp to utilize.Most magic are redundant, does not see much elemental difference.Sleep And Fire II is enough for everything.Played this for the 'RPG tag', few achievements and easy perfect game.Treated it as a cheap donation.One of the poorly made games with little effort.Does not recommend unless you play for the cards or the perfect game.

												Looking for a well-fleshed out, entralling story with great, typo-free scripts? A well-programmed, user-friendly experience?Well, keep looking.Game has some bugs, a number of typographical errors, storyline that's typical of old JRPGs, and gameplay that can easily be broken by the time you get two-thirds of the way in.  Only reason my playthrough went as long as it did was because, like a lot of other people it seems, at one point it wasn't explained where one of the required stops locations was and it was small enough to miss multiple times, even after traveling all over the map for a good 40 minutes.It's only real claim for your dollars is by going full Sakura-whathaveyou by implementing a party full of busty, scantily clad anime ladies... which you only get the full view of during dialogue, otherwise it's just small sprite that may be wearing animal-hide bikinins.If you can get it for free, or maybe just want an SNES-style RPG to play for a few hours, it -might- be worth grabbing.

												Do not play this game unless you enjoy staring at anime ♥♥♥♥♥ for three hours, because that will be the only enjoyment you get out of it.Also, it ends with a cliffhanger, and I want to spare you all the pain.I am crying as I type this.			"

												Without a shadow of a doubt, there are bucket loads of RPG Maker games out there in Steam. So, it will make things a lot difficult to choose what game is worth playing considering most are simply copy and paste straight from the engine itself. Well I decided to play ‘The Chosen RPG’. Why is that is because, at the time of writing this, there’s a sequel. So, that means this game has to be reasonable at least…right? Well, it does have its moments however it’s worth playing with a few considerations to think about.The storyline is extremely cliché. Bad guy wants to control the lands – hero having a troublesome past – three hot chicks helps hero – hero is the chosen one – hero’s goal is to kill bad person. That pretty much sums it up. There’s no twists or turns, no creative writing – just hero vs bad guy. What’s even more cliché is all the women you control, all wear skimpy clothing to the extreme. There’s no reason for this (other than the obvious) and shortly enough, the ‘novelty’ wears off very quickly, just like their clothing. It’s sad to say that, one of the women you control, Serenity, is fully clothed in a wallpaper background and she actually looks decent. But no, they all must have two piece bikinis and the male, fully armoured. However, I guess this game is not unique when it comes to this.The gameplay, just like the storyline, is the same ole RPG Maker style. Actually, it’s more akin to the Dragon Quest series (for which one can argue it’s more akin to the Wizardry series however that’s another story). And what’s even more laughable is that, according to the ‘About this game’ blurb, this game, or should I say this RPG is inspired by the Dragon Quest series. Well if the game’s engine plays pretty much like Dragon Quest, it’s a logical statement to say it’s ‘inspired’ by the Dragon Quest series. Anyways, such is life.Now, because the title did state ‘RPG’, there’s very little elements of RPG, or for the people who don’t know this term, Role Playing Game. Granted there are very little elements of quests (for which are linear in approach) and a bit of reading to do, there’s absolutely no stats management. Yes, there are stats however they auto assign as you progress in levels. Basically, each hero has a specific role – i.e. the main character Edge is your warrior, Serenity, warrior with hand to hand abilities, Myste, the mage and Trinity, warrior / mage.So, with this setup, you really have no choice but to smash your opponents to oblivion. I guess you really cannot do much else considering the combat system shows the entire party to the right of the screen and the enemy/s left. It plays out in a turned based sequence meaning it’s your turn to assign actions then the enemy/s. Combat requires very little tactics and, because each character has a handful of ‘special’ abilities, can spice up the combat somewhat.The game does not explain about the mechanics at all. There are some stats I have no idea what they are. However, there’s an option where you can select ‘optimise’ to auto select the character’s best equipment at hand and I used this every time. Then again, because the game’s overall simplicity (i.e. smash and smash again), you really didn’t need to understand the mechanics like percentage ratios or damage mitigation (if there is any). A good example of this is, I have no idea what damage range is by the spell Fire II or Lightning II. I even have no idea if any monsters have resistance to any spells or attacks – they all feel the same. So, in a nutshell, spam your favourite spell / attack – it all works out in the end.Speaking of graphics, most are straight from the RPG Maker so I’m not going to talk about that. It’s simply a copy and paste job. However, I’m not sure if the main character’s portraits are templates too. I think they are not however if you have seen or play an RPG Maker game, this looks just like any other – i.e. 16bit animations. And there’s nothing really wrong with that actually. However, I really like the musical scores for this game – it actually suits very well and enjoyable to listen to. I’m not sure if they are also from the RPG Maker templates and if so, then I retract these words.As far as completion goes, it’s not a long and drawn out game. Granted it does have some grinding to do however not to the extreme. There is a level cap at 30 (for which again does not explain – it’s a matter of discovering it yourself) and the land is regarded as open world – meaning you can travel anywhere as long you have the vehicle to do so (e.g. a boat to sail the seas). However, if you try to enter a location where the storyline doesn’t direct you to, it will block you out as every other location (other than the one where to story tells you to) requires a certain item to enter – meaning the overall progression is linear. Because I play like a sloth on a lazy day, it took me around 8.5 hours to complete. However, it’s not unheard of completing this game much less than that. I have read people finishing this off in around 4 hours and less even.With so much negativity going around in this review maybe makes you think it’s not a good idea to play it. Well and surprising enough, the game does have some strengths. It has Steam trading cards however they all look poorly made. The good news is that there’s only five to collect to create a badge. Also, there are 8 achievements to collect and they are actually achievable, meaning no 20000 hours of grinding and so on. There are three that can be missed however overall, they are pretty easy to hit that 100% completion. Also, I really like that feature near the end about answering ten questions about the game. That made me think the developers did place some thought about the game’s lore. Lastly there’s a little ‘parchment’ hunting that further explains the backstory of this game. However each parchment only contains just a handful of words.Now the big question is whether is game is worth playing? Initially I would say no however there are some glitter of love in this game (like the 10 questions I have mentioned above). Also, at the time of writing this, there is a part II to the saga. Again, one can argue it’s more of a cash cow than anything else. Yet, with a price tag of just USD $2.00 you really cannot go wrong with that. And considering this game goes on sale very often and, at times, forms part of a package where you can save even more, it’s worth a bash if you want a quick win.5 / 10 (worth playing however there are a few caveats to consider).

												Quite decent JRPG, plot bit generic, but acceptable, music is okay... and some girls look nice! :)Don't expect too much, the game can be finished in three or four hours, just bit more if you want to get all achievements.			"

												This game is as generic as it gets for an RPG Maker game, and the story is not clear on most things.If you want to play some GOOD RPG Maker games, go play either The Witch's House (freebie), Ao Oni (also freebie), Sins Of The Demon (on Steam), ib (another freebie), or OFF (yet another freebie). Notice how 4 of the 5 games I mentioned are freeware games? Yeah.I did have a good laugh out of the main chatacter's name though.			"
