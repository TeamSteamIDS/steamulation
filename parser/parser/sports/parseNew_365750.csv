												I quite like the game as it is one of the very few Rugby games out there, it's certainly not perfect but it is a lot of fun.  The main issue I am encountering is CRASHING, it is constant and makes the game totally unplayable, very disappointed and am hoping for an update soon as I wish to spend more time playing!  Cannot reccomend at present as unplayable otherwise pretty fun for Rugby fans (although not the polished article).  3/10.**UPDATE** - Shall re-trial the game to see if I can get rid of the crashing issue and the report back. Original game was a lot of fun so hoping that re-installing will remedy the issue!			"

												Not without some flaws and missing features, but definitely a good, fun and quite deep rugby simulation experience.To the players complaining about unresponsive keyboard, plug a pad, it works well.			"

												This game had poor reviews but I thought it coudn't be as bad as everyone was saying, so gave it a chance, believe me IT IS WORSE than stated!!  Why would a game that is using the licenced logo of the rugby World cup not have the correct team lists?  Also I can't pass using my controller and there doesn't seem to be anywhere to change the controls.This game cost $39.99, not worth it if it cost $3.99.  My advice is wait for Rugby Challenge 3!			"

												♥♥♥♥♥poor effort.I thought I'd buy it purely because I've been itching to play a PC rugby game.Team sheets are poor. No rugby game should have NZ or SA incomplete.You would expect graphics to have moved on from the last world cup.Gameplay is shoddy.Waste of money.Do not purchase, rather wait for Rugby Challenge 3.

												Thoroughly enjoying the game. Using a gamepad, which is working really well. The graphics are decent; the gameplay is fast-paced and enjoyable; and the controls work really well. It is easily the best rugby game I have played, despite the many negative reviews. Compared to other rugby games, this seems to give much more freedom to actually play rugby properly and to execute a fast-paced running game. The controls for rucking are another highlight, I believe, actually allowing for slight errors to result in penalties (as opposed to just deliberate actions). One or two people have suggested that you may need a decent working knowledge of the sport to enjoy this game, and I can see how that could be true. Even so, I would still strongly recommend this game.			"

												I'll recommend, but with a catch: don't pay more than $5 for this. I was quite close to giving it thumbs down due to the frequency of glitches during game play.I like the game. I live in the states, and there isn't much for rugby where I live. I don't care so much about the accuracy of team lineups as much as I just want to experience rugby in some kind of way besides watching youtube games, and this pretty much satisfies that need.Obviously play this with a game pad.Here's some glitches and other complaints from my 6 hours of play:- Defender on the other team ran in circles around the ruck for the last half of the game.- Defender on other team frozen in place.- Time expired for the half when I was on defense and won the ruck. The players all froze on the field and I had to quit the match.- Passing is about 95% reliable. Once in a while the pass goes off in a random direction that I did not want.- The switch pass is a little slow to respond.- Free play mode is only a single player-no way to make unopposed runs to practice, which leads me to...- There is no good explaination in tutorials or documentation of what the ""change attack"" and ""change defense"" buttons do, I didn't even realize that was an option until several hours of play.

												It is said that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of type writers would eventually write the complete works of Shakespere. It turns out it only takes 4 monkeys with 1 typewriter to produce an awful video game loosely based on the game of rugby. I bought this for just under £5 and now I wish I had spent that money getting AIDS from a low end ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.PROS:-This game didn't give me AIDSCONS:-The controls were designed by a WWII veteran with dementia who had forgotten what it was like to have hands.-You have two camera angles to choose from both designed by Ants In My Eyes Johnson.-The players aren't real players which makes the game about as immersive as taking a bath that's been filled with the sneeze of a small child.-The game of rugby was described to HB studios by a hebrew man with no tongue down a bad phone line. Apparently no one at HB studios speaks Hebrew.Summary:If you're desperate to play a rugby based video game, then be desperate for longer.If you loved RWC 2011 then you'll hate this game.If you love rugby you'll hate this game.If you want to waste your money on something see above mentioned ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea.
