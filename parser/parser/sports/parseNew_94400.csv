												Step 1) Buy Nidhogg.Step 2) Buy 2 controllers.Step 3) Find some friends.Step 4) Get your friends all riled up and competitive.Step 5) Play Nidhogg with friends using controllers.Step 6) Enjoy the most hilarious exchange of cowardly and un-man-ful screaming you will ever hear. This game is truly amazing as a local vs. experience. Plus, the sound track on some of those stages is amazing. Great game, increadibly precise, but accessible. Tons of fun!			"

												You're at the last part of the level and one enemy stands in your way. It gives you this giddy feeling, those 5 seconds of a showdown, staring down your opponent, waiting to see who's going to make the first move. The adrenaline starts pumping after you charge in for the first swing and your opponent counters and knocks your sword out of your hand. You're swordless. You close your eyes and take a deep breath as your opponent charges at you with his sword. Seconds before impact you leap and flip over his head, grab your sword, turn around and throw it right through his head. As he falls to the ground you spit on his body and sprint through the gate to the cheering of thousands of spectators.Then a giant worm eats you. Victory.This game rocks. I'll start off with that. You got these tiny little guys with swords fencing for their lives back and forth as the bodies pile up. This is the kind of game that you can actually be skillful at, by watching the o0ther person's sword you can try to figure out how to counter what he's doing. It has a mortal combat type ladder single player where you play through a bunch of levels against harder and harder characters and I've managed to get about halway up. Not sure if there are lives but if you lose you continue from the same character you don't have to start over.I'm most excited for the multiplayer though, I can't wait to invite some friends over to play this because this is one of those games which will cause a lot of screaming and yelling. I just played a random person through the matchmaking a bunch of times and it worked flawlessly, I'm excited to play more.Also in the multiplayer section where there's offline and other options for multiplayer there are a whole sleuth of ""variants"": Slow mo, Fast mo, boomerang swords, divekicks, throwing and other stuff.Really not a bad learning curve. Yeah, the first couple of rounds you can't figure out what the hell is going on, but after 15 minutes of trial and error I was leaping, stabbing, and doing a lot of other weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ Music's not shabby, you got the shwing shwing of the swords in there so I'm happy.The game makes you feel like that guy from Princess Bride with those wiggly swords.The bad: No windowed mode, and the how to play menu is broken to all hell. Just check the controls and go with it.It's just a fun game, it's got a lot of replay value and it would always be cool to see more levels or maybe... hats?			"

												Probably few people have heard about Nidhogg. At first glance it's a simple 2D fighting with 8-bit graphics. But is it really?　I CHALLENGE YOU TO A PIXEL DUEL　　There is no plot in Nidhogg. Instead, only fights with a computer opponent or with other people in online. The meaning of each battle is not killing the enemy, but in achieving the opposite end of the map. Four keys for movement, one key for punch and one key for jump. Sounds easier than it actually is. In fact, fightings are very funny and full of madness, but not without subtleties of the combat system. I advise you to play only in the company of friends. Singleplayer and online battles with strangers doesn't bring much fun.　NOT ENOUGH PIXELS　　Nidhogg has enough of advantages to buy it. But there are some unpleasant drawbacks. Too few maps, quickly bored gameplay, inconvenient system for playing online with friends (A friend is not always able to connect to your game). These shortcomings, in fact, are not much spoiling the gaming experience. If it were not for one thing. Too high price. Seriously. It should cost twice less, judging on how many content in it.　Multiplayer:　　Online: ☺☺☺☺☺OOOOO　　Co-op: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Storyline: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OOO　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OO　Complexity of the achievements: Some achievements will make you play this game for a long time. And not all of them can be easily performed.　　　Nidhogg is a game with a so much　　fun and madness, but with so few　　levels and other content. If you're don't　　mind to spending so much money on it,　　then you'll are sure to spend a few fun　　evenings.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To buy or not to buy, that is the question [6.5/10]. "

												Way too expensive for what it is. Although it's a very fun local game or just to play online with a friend that's close, there's barely any content here. I believe there's just 4 maps in this, only 1 type of weapon, and no netplay with random people. Once in awhile it's fun to pick up and play, but definitely not worth the price.			"

												Nidhogg is a fast paced, local multiplayer focused fencing game developed by Messhof. In Nidhogg you take up fencing and fight one on one matches against AI or other players through local or online multiplayer. The aim of the game is to make it past your opponent and run to the other side of the map.+Awesome pixel graphics+Simple gameplay, all you have to do is stab your opponent and run to the other side of the map, it might sound boring but it's actually really entertaining, especially when playing with friends+The different maps are very different to each other which provides some nice variation for the game+Nidhogg can be enjoyed in Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer/Matchmaking+The fast-paced side-scrolling nature of Nidhogg makes it perfect for playing in Local Multiplayer and things get pretty intense, making Local Multiplayer pretty exhilirating and the best way to enjoy the game+Nidhogg features a tournament mode which allows 3-8 players to play Local Multiplayer+The soundtrack is great and fits with the game well+The fighters in the game are all brightly coloured and blood basically acts like paint for the maps so you end up with some pretty cool designs on the floor if one area of the map gets particularly bloody+Both the KB&M controls and the 360 Gamepad controls are very good and very responsive-Nidhogg has a severe lack of content due to only having four maps, for £10.99 that kind of content really isn't good enough-Singleplayer gets repetitive (thanks to the lack of content) very quickly-Until recently Online Multiplayer wasn't very good (due to lag mainly) but it has been fixed, sadly it would seem not many people who own Nidhogg know that it was fixed since the game's Online Multiplayer remains pretty much deadVerdict:Highly Recommended, but Only When Discounted (6.5/10)Nidhogg is a great, fast paced fighting game with awesome graphics and simple gameplay, sadly the game is very much let down by its lack of content and high asking price. If you're looking for what is one of the best Local Multiplayer games on Steam and you don't mind paying the high price then give Nidhogg a go, if not, wait for a sale.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

												This game is somewhat of a double-edged sword. If you have a friend (or enemy) who is in the room with you, this game is great. Otherwise, you probably shouldn't get it.The game plays like an elaborate dance; two players fighting for the honour of being consumed by the titular serpent- the Nidhogg. The controls are simple: one button jabs your sword, one button makes you jump. The real beauty is how the mechanics blend together. Swords can be moved up and down to reach a jumping or ducking enemy. Swords at the same height will clash, and can block the opposing player's attacks. Swords can also be knocked out of a players hand by some particularly crafty swordplay. Jousting with your sword fully raised throws your sword through the air, which is hard to dodge, but leaves you without your best weapon. Thrusting in midair results in a divekick, a techniquie used to relieve the enemy of their weapon (that is, if you don't impale yourself on their weapon first). The result is an EXTREMELY intense sword battle. Matches can last for seconds, others can last for half of an hour or more. The ducking and dodging and jumping and running blends brilliantly with the game's glitch-art style and kickass music. You can play this before the start of a lecture. You can play this at a party, with a tournament of eight players. You can use it as a substitute for rock-paper-scissors in decision-making situations. It's become one of my go-to games when friends are over (see also: touhou 9).However, this only applies if you have real-life friends. Sure, the game has online play, but it's horribly laggy and bugged, with no sign of a fix. The lag ruins the crucial fast-paced action of the game and usually results in the host player winning. Because of this, you'll be very lucky to actually find anyone through the matchmaking service. The single-player mode is basically multiplayer but against a series of bots, which each have distinct playstyles and weaknesses. It's very much like playing against real players, but nowhere near as fun as having friends to play with in the same room. Additionally, the price is VERY steep for what the contents of the game are: only four (admittedly BEAUTIFUL) levels. Overall: One of the best local multiplayer games that exist. If you have real friends that can come over and play: get this game ...but get it during a sale. If you have no friends: sorry, this game isn't for you. Go out and make some friends instead!			"

												This is my first review on steam.This game is awesome to play against friends, it is intense and purely skill based. The biggest problem with this is the multiplayer system only works when it wants to so you can't even play online with your buddies unless the ""Server"" is feeling okay. When the server is working which is probably isn't right now, you are unable to customize the online multiplayer match which is a huge part of the multiplayer experience in nidhogg. In conclusion this is not a $15 game. I am glad I bought it for $3 and it is worth that when it is working. Offline mode locally I am sure is the only use for this game. Do not pay $15, beyond waste.			"

												Don't always go for the top reviews like I did with this one. This game looked fantastic in the videos. It actually is if you go by the single player mode which doesn't last long and (more importantly) local multiplayer. Local multiplayer is where this shines. If you engage in this frequently, get it. I only have occasional local multiplayer games and this is why it was a bad purchase for me and might be for you.There hasn't been one update since this game's release. The guy ignored EVERY support request and then had the cheek to release it on the PS4. Why is this a problem? The netcode is HORRIBLE, and latency is the most important factor with a game where reaction time can be very important. If you play online and enjoy it consistently, get back to me, because that would be the first I've heard about it. Players will teleport more than in Counter-Strike in the '90s and is more buggy than the Master Chief Collection.			"

												I have been looking forward to this game for a long time, and figured that after 3 years of ""development"" (or what ever they were doing with it before releasing) this would be a really well polished game, and it is to a great extent. 	The offline 2 player duel gameplay is simply amazing, hectically fast and fun twitch game. Playing with a friend could grant you countless hours of fun. The graphics are beautiful. If this was a freeware game it would be great, if it was $2 it would be great, however it is priced at 15$ which is too much to pay for the amount of content (which is 4 arenas and a tacked on single player mode) 	Now the bad things are, as some people have mentioned; The ONLINE multilayer is currently  unplayable, a big bummer for me. Another really big bummer is that in fact, it does NOT have ""full"" controller support; It does support fancy Xbox controllers, but it would not recognize my lovely SNES style USB controllers which other games recognize just fine. So ya, this coupled with a 15$ price tag and lack of content leads me to a thumb down :( sorry. 	Once again it IS a great 2 player offline game, and I will be playing it a lot when I have friends over, but its not worth 15$. Wait till this game is cheaper and patched for proper controller support and online play, then it will be worth it.EDIT: GOOD: I have had a few good online games with minimal lag, but it is rare with random matches. BAD:  Game variant options do not seem work in online matches.			"

												Nidhogg provides some of the fastest and most enjoyable monochromatic bloodletting one could hope to experience.   The premise is simple.  You are a pixelated swordsman in a territorial conflict with your opponent, most often your best friend sitting right beside you.  Each standoff is lightning fast, and invariably ends in a gratuitous splattering of blood.   Kill your opponent with a well-timed and well-placed lunge, hurl your épée at his head, or just knock him down and rip his heart out.  Savagery is encouraged, and provides a hilarious counterpoint to the civilized image of fencing.  Once you have managed to kill your opponent, you can progress to your goal until just seconds later, he respawns and you must again defeat him to progress. Lose, and he gains ground on you. This ebb and flow continues until one of you reaches the final screen where the winner is given a true hero’s sendup: He is eaten by a flying worm.Nidhogg is not just a circus of inanity and violence, but is some of the best fun you can have with your friends.  Controls are responsive, animations are fast and smooth, and landing consecutive killing blows provides a jolt of dopamine that keeps you coming back for more.  There are multiple arenas to choose from, each one visually unique and designed to make you rethink your strategy.  Some corridors are too tight for jumping or sword throwing, so both your opponent and the landscape will make you think on your toes.Visually, Nidhogg exhibits a unique combination of minimalism through pixilation and solid colors.  It highlights the expression of characters through animation rather than textures.  It is aesthetically arresting and securely has its own style.  These visuals are elevated even further when coupled with an exceptional soundtrack by Daedelus.Nidhogg could have provided only the core one-on-one experience, but if you look deeper there are a lot of extras.  There is a tournament mode supporting up to 8 players. There is a multitude of variants in gameplay to explore. There is a single player experience pitting you against an increasingly difficult array of AI personalities.  Additionally, there is an online multiplayer component, but at the time of this review, I experienced some unfortunate glitches.  In several matches I experienced moments where I killed my opponent, but immediately the game changed states, and my character unexplainably died.  It wasn’t often, but it was often enough to sour the experience.  I’m told that the online component is still a work in progress, so if you don’t have a friend handy to play local multiplayer check the forums for progress.Nidhogg was first shown in 2010, and since then Messhoff, comprised of Mark Essen and Kristy Norindr, have worked to shine the core game into a full-fledged release.  Nidhogg is available today on Steam for $11.99, and if you have friends, it is well worth your dollars.			"

												Nidhogg is not bad at all in terms of gameplay. I won’t go into much detail because the trailers and such pretty much show what it's about, but its damn fun to play. The combat has a lot of options and things going for it and nicely juggles both complexity and ease of learning. The music and visuals match and mesh with the feel of the combat excellently. I can easily see how co-op can be a blast with friends, or the tourney potential. So why is this not recommended? Because the devs cared more about the game’s style, raw gameplay, and media hype then its long-term substance or support. You’re playing this game and having a lot of fun, and then before you even hit the one hour mark you find yourself thinking “that’s it?” and then it’s all downhill from there. Singleplayer consists of you fighting a dozen or two progressively harder AI opponents, however the stages start looping after opponent four. Yep, only four stages. There’s no story to speak of or even an attempt at one, and once you’re done with it you’re left with nearly nothing else to do with the game. Multiplayer is dead, D-E-A-D. Its features are minimal and in terms of functionality the MP barely worked when the game came out, and then because they never fixed it people gave up on it entirely so there’s no one playing. This game deserved more support and more features and updates from a solid company. But because it didn’t get that and most likely won’t ever, I am sorry to say that charging $15 for this is broad daylight robbery and I cannot recommend it. Only buy this if it’s on sale, and with the understanding that outside of being a weekend distraction or occasional hour of fun with a friend this game has no value.			"

												Nidhogg embodies the aggressive, intoxicating thrill of competition. Through hazily defined personas and their ethereal exacting movements, a simple duel is transformed into a bustling frenzy of close saves, impossible luck, and overlapping cries of victory and defeat. It only took one match for me to fall in love with Nidhogg – to be hooked by the overwhelming energy that erupts both inside and outside the game – and hours later each round continues to bring with it that same feeling that I’m discovering something incredible for the first time and desperately need someone to share it with.In the most concise and direct of terms, Nidhogg is a two-player fencing game which calls back to the simpler times of 80’s arcade classics like Joust and Pong, but bridges the generational gap with a precision and adrenaline that would have melted the insides of the quarter devouring machines which have grown extinct over the last 30 years. Nidhogg’s indirect heritage doesn’t define it so much as provides a sense of place for Nidhogg where so many other games are quickly lost and forgotten. Already it feels like a classic I’ve loved for years and a staple game that is kept installed eternally as part of an evergreen collection of multiplayer games.Nidhogg works so immensely well because it’s the sort of game you stop thinking about almost immediately. Controlling your swordsman in Nidhogg is impeccably intuitive as they move and react contextually and clearly, causing you to forget about how your controlling them as you focus all your attention on what you’re actually doing. Nidhogg feels much like a spontaneous dance between two people attempting to kill each other. It’s not about executing a particular move or performing a perfect counter block, but allowing yourself to be taken by the moment as you and your opponent flow together in a blur of kicks and stabs as you fight against each other in a deadly tug of war.The organic interplay which develops over the course of a match helps keep Nidhogg from ever feeling one-sided the way many multiplayer games do. Everything which takes place during a match is the dual result of two players colliding and reacting with one another, which forms a dynamic that feels cordial and joyful. Even during my worst matches I often found myself erupting in laugher over my own mistakes and haphazard attempts to regain ground, because even when I’m losing Nidhogg’s ridiculous pace and explosions of pixels are still ludicrously fun to be a part of.To me the lifespan of a multiplayer game is almost entirely based on whether or not it’s enjoyable to the person losing, and I’ve never played a competitive game where me and my supposed competitor have fallen into such fits of laughter precisely because we’re losing. Nidhogg is a brilliantly tactical and engaging beast of a fighting game, but that it can also allow for a much friendlier mood and feel satisfying even when you’re outmatched is a remarkable achievement very few other games can boast.I suppose it has to be mentioned though that there is one rather enormous qualifier to recommending Nidhogg, that being the requirement of another local player. Though there is a single player mode it feels like a lifeless shell of its multiplayer counterpart, only potentially worth venturing into as a means of practicing advanced strategies against increasingly tough AI opponents. The online mode as well, despite being fairly functional, can’t compete with the feeling of having another person in the room with you (even more so if you are playing against random players). It will suffice if you have absolutely no other options, but I found myself growing tired of it fairly quickly and wishing the person I was playing with was sitting next to me instead of on the other end of the internet.I desperately hope that whoever is reading this won’t be hamstrung by a lack of local competition though, as with another person in the room Nidhogg is a phenomenal experience that takes only moments to sell itself but has had me repeatedly stuck in place for hours at a time, always shocked when I finally look at the clock and realize how long we’ve been playing. It’s a finely tuned machine you won’t notice and a catalyst for the delightful multiplayer mayhem that few other games have come anywhere close to matching for me.Developer Messhof understands that multiplayer means more than putting two players on the screen; that making sure multiple people are having fun isn’t as simple as letting them play together, and that creating a friendly competition in a space where there can be only one winner is perhaps the easiest thing to screw up and the most imperative to get right. Nidhogg doesn’t assume what it’s doing is easy the way a lot of similar games seem to, but knows if it can get it right that the end result is an atmosphere and enthusiasm that can’t be matched. Wow, did they ever follow through on that one.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

What you see in the trailer is exactly what you get - it is fairly bare-bones, which is ok because it works well. What is not ok is the asking price. Fifteen bucks for what I believe is only three levels and very little options just doesn't make me happy. I got it for like two bucks and I still don't really play it all that much.My main problems:-Too much money for not nearly enough content (not to compare or anything but Christ I got Minecraft for 13$)-They could certainly add in more variation (I mean idk - how about different fighters/colors/levels/weapons/etc.)			"

												Want a fun little game where the pure aim is to stab your friends repeatedly and run to the other side of the map? Then this is the game for you!Pros: The game is fun, fast paced, keeps you on your toes, music is perfect for the game and comedic moments are never far behind.Cons:It's very limited, you fight your way to the other side of the map then rinse and repeat.Matchmaking is terrible it takes too long to find an opponent unless you are playing against friends, this is primarily due to the fact that having very little to do in the game results in short play times and once you've done it there's really no need to go back.Overall:It's not really worth the money for what it is. It's very fun but the fun will soon run out. I would only recommend it if you have the money to spend on it for only a couple hours of fun. "

												Nidhogg is a simplistic fencing game, the winner being the one who comes out on top in a contest of deadly tug-of-war, with a welcoming art style, dynamic soundtrack, a polite attention to detail and incredibly pleasing vistas, this game warms you inside, as you physically and mentally try to out-do your opponent and advance screens. The price isn't totally agreeable, £10.99 ($15) is a tad steep in my opinion as there isn't too much to do alone. However, this game shines in its co-op fun factor. Attemping to line up your friend(s) on your sword like a pixelated shish kebab is very amusing and you'll find yourselves having a blast whenever you're together and Nidhogg's involved. If you've got a buddy to have a 'stab' at this game with then do. Other than that, it's most probably worth getting for yourself in a sale, and only in a sale.			"

												Gameplay always comes first, beyond story or visuals. Gameplay is what makes a game tick. And gameplay is where Nidhogg shines.It's tense tactical game where your skills as a player matter as much as your ability to lure and trick your opponent. It's a subtle give and take, of establishing patterns only to break them, of intimate moments of stillness and caution as the two of you step back and forth anticipating the first strike.It's a game where all are equally matched, where true skill decides the victor rather than the perks, upgrades, boosters of so many other gamesThe simplicity of the controls hide a surprisingly tense and strategic game. One hit kills and there's a wide range of moves and maneuvers at your disposal. While I love Samurai Gunn's lightning fast speed and more varied maps, Nidhogg's slower paced, more cerebral challenge is absolutely addicting. And while you may be able to leap through the air with ease in Samurai Gunn, your moveset is far more versatile in Nidhogg. The smooth animations give each fight a fluid dynamic feel.Not that the visuals are bad either. The surreal graphics and chunky pixels give the game a style all its own. And while the number of maps may seem small, it's definitely a case of quality over quanity. Each map is unique, with its own eccentricities to be mastered from the concealing high grass of the Wilds to the collapsing bridges in Clouds. Not only that, each map consists of several areas as you and your opponent push back and forth to victory. Epic 20 minute duels are not uncommonI rarely play online games, but Nidhogg has me hooked. This is a must play			"

												Nidhogg is a side scrolling fighting game which was released in early 2014. You duel against another sword wielding foe.  You have to get to the other side of the map before your opponent. In order to do so, you must run, jump, throw your sword and slide past the other enemies. The actual gameplay is very simple, just kill the other guy really. This can be done in a number of ways, the most common is just to kill the enemy in a sparing match. You can also disarm your opponent by knocking their weapon out of their hands leaving them very vulnerable with just their fists to fight back with. You can get quite technical if you want though, by wall jumping, dive kicks and knocking down enemies by sliding their feet out. Nidhogg has a single player mode, which is quite enjoyable, but can be completed in about two hours if you have any sort of skill at the game. The single player is essentially the four different levels repeated over and over increasing in difficulty. While I did have fun playing this mode, the real fun from Nidhogg comes out of the local multiplayer mode. This will pit you against your friends in a duel with the same mechanics as previously mentioned, things get competitive very fast, so watch out!  We also have an online multiplayer options available, however there were no players online every time I checked so I would class this as a no go zone.The graphics are a very simplistic style, which actually have a nice look to them; this is the type of game that doesn't need fancy textures and shadows to make it more appealing, as you hardly pay any attention to the graphics due to how fast paced the gameplay is. The single player mode of Nidhogg is about two hours long, so if you are purely looking for a single player experience, this may not be for you since there is not much replay-ability for single player. If you have friends who you can hook up a second controller with, Nidhogg really shines there. The majority of my time on Nidhogg was spent in a local multiplayer mode and it's an absolute blast.Whilst I think the price of £10,99 is quite steep for this game given the lack of single player and online multiplayer content available, the amount of fun you can have in local multiplayer redeems it slightly. So I am going to recommend Nidhogg, but only when it is on sale for anything under £5.  This is certainly a game I will be keeping installed for when friends come round. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play

												It's funny and competitive. No other game lets you that much control over your sword. The fighters are nimble, and the controls are smooth. As much as it's amazing when playing with someone, it's boring alone, and the online is dead. Buy it only if you have IRL friends. Also, to play only in short game sessions.			"

												I love this game, I love it soo much. But I'm nearly very close to giving it a thumbs down due to the somewhat buggy gameplay and shallow content. I have played this game extremely competitively and have a current record of 9:11, and from that 27 hour experience I can say I've speculated about every mechanic in this game down the very brim and have noticed extremely miniscule mistakes in the programming. This game needs to be more polished. Thank you. 7 / 10			"

												This game is a work of art.  Definitely a masterpiece.  The swordplay is very interesting and different from many other games.The online multiplayer, however, is severely broken.  There is currently no indication that the developer intends to fix the problem, yet they are offering a 2-pack purchase option.Even if online multiplayer was working properly, even with the unique gameplay, the price seems far too high for the tiny amount of content this game provides.  You can ""beat"" this game and see everything it has to offer in less than 30 minutes.  For the same amount of money you can find many, many other high quality games on Steam that will provide more fulfilling experiences.			"

												Fun bag of chips type game.  Okay at parties, not much else.  Even at parties it won't be the life of the party, but it might have a couple good bites.  If you get it free or super cheap it's reasonably fun.It is absurdly overpriced though.  Also the online netcode is/was awful, leading to less people online and thus worse ping and a worse experience and ability to troubleshoot in a vicious cycle.  Do not expect online to be fun other than to laugh at the jankiness.I am not recommending this game only because of the price point.  If you can get it for a buck or two, then fine.  Otherwise spend your money on something better.			"

												4 years in development, reviews scoring it 9/10, many ""indie"" awards won...Yet this is a game that barely works, and SOME bugs were fixed literally 22 months later after its release. It's a good local-multiplayer game for breaks don't get me wrong, but it is sadly full of issues.-Terribly overpriced: very basic gameplay in 4 maps for 15 euros. Steam Workshop would have been great...-Bad netcode: do you know the feeling of waking up from bed, only to realize it was just a dream and find yourself back in bed? Yeah, same feeling. I would not recommend this game if you plan on playing online, friends included.-(Keyboard) controls: everytime I launch the game my mapped controls go back to default. Also I have yet to know which button is used to select options in the pause screen. Controls during gameplay are fine, though.-It's supposed to be a competitive game, but it is overall so shallow, monotonous... It makes you close the game AND wish it could have more content at the same time.			"

												This is certainly one of my favourite local multiplayer games. Although it's 2 player, this actually works in its favour as it means you can have a great game with a smaller group than many local multiplayer titles, and it's so fun to watch that it works well with spectators.From a small series of moves, Nidhogg produces often hilarious fencing moments, either from daring displays of skill or comical misjudgements resulting in failure. I'd like to see more environments in this game, but it remains a great one to have in a collection to pull out when you've got guests over and there's a bit of a lull.			"

After this was fixed it went from unplayable to not bad.I still don't think it is great netcode but its not as awful as I had originally seen. My friend and I could play it together but there were a lot of times where it made no sense (someone would die but the other player was too far away to kill them). Its not great with latency, so if you and your friend are not in the same country I wouldn't even bother with multiplayer.			"

												You fight, yet you do not fight. This is a dance, one of death, and of desperation. It is a series of brief, brutal, yet exceptionally precise fights, which spin out into a tug of war woven over various arenas. You roll, you kick, you throw your sword, you panic, you grab the ledge and haul yourself up, you knock your foe down, you grab your sword. You kill him.He respawns ten feet away.This pattern repeats, music constantly shifting with the feet, and on occasion terrain of the landscape upon which you fight. In castles, upon clouds, in dungeons, with lava erupting behind you. A constant barrage of visual information, yet your duellist is kept simple, a monotone duellist with a white sword, and his movements are slick, precise and razor sharp. You move, he twitches, he adjusts his sword with a tap of the key, he lunges, he riposts, he rolls, he grabs his foe and kills him in a bloody manner. He runs forward.Then he gets eaten by a worm. WINNER.This is not a game you win. This is a game you play, and you perfect. The art is the fencing, everything else is just icing on the deliciously precise cake. Dark Souls pared down to it's most barest of essentials, fighting games without their glitz, a relentless focus on two things : You. Your sword.Are you quick enough? No. Be quicker. Be better. Respawn. Try it again. Die. Respawn. Again.Welcome to Nidhogg.			"

												Before yoy read my review for this game, I'd like you to look at my hours, yes, 2 hours. However, I played this game in offline mode, alot, and because of steam then, it never recorded my hours, I have tried co op with a friend of mine, so I at least have perspective on this.-You may now read the review! :DNow, to be fair, I DID have fun playing this game. Sure, at first glace it just looks like a simple game; but while the controls are very simple, the actual combat is extremly complex (stabbing, hand to hand, throwing, catching, etc). To put it simply, it's generally a good game, it's fair, it's fun, and it is very challenging to keep you interested if you're into this. Overall, I'd say for this genre of fighting games, it's perfect. But you look above and see the thumbs Doooown. Two main reasons.1. If you are not really into fighting game, but you do enjoy them, then it seems perfect to get this game; don't. Honestly, the game doesn't give that much content, there are only 4 levels in the game, which is understandable, since the actual level design is marvelous, but for most people who play fighting game, they want levels where you can perform combos and such; where in Nidhogg; it's not about combos, but about speed; so really, this game ISN'T under most fighting game genres. To put it short; it's just generally not a fighting game; it's just a game of tag, with swords.2. The price; even if you are into this game, and the game alone, honestly, for 15 bucks, I could buy the binding of isaac for 5 dollars, and get about 10 times the amount of content in this, I'm not even kidding. Isaac aside; there isn't much play value if you don't have a controller (Sure, you can play without the controller, but it's extremly awkward using the keyboard at once when you are in a really tense situation); and even if you do, you'd probably get about 15 hours worth, before you and your friend gets bored entirely. While the game is VERY well made with excellent work, I'd only get this game during a sale; to me, the game is worth about 6 dollars at the most.One thing I would like to note that, this is simply my opinion, because alot of people in the review section have good points about the game, if possible, give this game a go, it didn't satify my tastes, but it certinly did for alot of other people. So who knows, maybe you'll be that badass ninja guy who can throw his sword like a boomerang, and kill 2 guys in a single swing. Who knows!			"

			Fight! We've survived a duel to the death to bring you our review of Nidhogg. Narrated by: Josh Script by: Val and Josh Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

While many wait for the next big title, smaller indie games fill the gaps within the major AAA releases. Among these titles is Nidhogg from developer Messhof. At first glance the portrait displayed isn't anything that would take a spot in a respectable museum but take another look and the fine details may surprise you. Nidhogg's image may not be of this generation or the last few for that matter but for all it's simplicity does its transcend to the height of AAA titles?	Focused on it's combat Nidhogg offers very little in content, the single player consists of dueling several enemies within the four available stages in side-scrolling fashion. The goal is the same throughout, make it across to the opposite end whist in numerous duels of death. The respawns are unlimited but once either makes it across 3 screens the game is over and the victor is eaten by the Nidhogg, the world tree chomping worm of Norse mythology.	If there is anything that Nidhogg does extremely well is its combat, the intricate system requires quick reflexes, perfect timing and finesse. Considering the simple premise, the multitude of stances and moves offer up a good amount of depth.  Duels expanding across the pixilated canvas aren't uncommon and it's a testament to how deep the combat is. Stage hazards do play their role but in the end the better fighter will come out on top. It's any easy game to get into and one that offers up some intense moments with duels reaching ridiculous heights. 	Without a doubt the visuals of Nidhogg are not the main attraction, it's sprite based aesthetics do enough to portray the environments and figures throughout the world. Though limited the end result gives Nidhogg some visual charm and identity. Seeing the floor and walls painted with the players matter is chuckle worthy and a nice touch displaying the chaos among adversaries. 	However, the small amount of stages leaves much to desire, considering how simple the levels are it's hard to imagine why any DLC has not been introduced. Stages present little in the imagination department with minimal inspiration. In light of how much was presented in the combat one would imagine a larger emphasis in the level design to promote replayability. 	Nidhogg's multiplayer is crippled by the absence of any online lobby system that could in fact strengthen the competitive mode drastically. The limited online mutliplayer consist of single encounters unless played locally via the bracket based tournament mode. The idea behind the mode is brilliant but why it isn't available online is a major misstep in the design. 	Nidhogg is a charming experience that could of been greater if not for it's lack in content and multiplayer options. The simple to execute yet deep combat system is offset by many other flaws in design. Nidhoggs first attempt has the most important aspect of any game of this style right, it may be completely lacking in narrative but definitely a game made for competitive multiplayer. Playing with some buds is fun and Nidhogg does a great job with contact kills allowing you to embellish every neck break or impalement of a friend.  It's simple, stupid, and addicting fun.  Pick it up on a sale, the asking price might be a bit steep for the short but humorous experience.+Great Combat+Unique Identity+The Nidhogg has no Mercy-Lack of online options and lobbies-Cloud stage is weak-Lag can be an issue-Flat soundtrack6.9 "

												My first online match had me cackling with glee. Fast paced fencing! You can change from low, mid, high stances plus you can hold up to throw your sword in a last ditch effort. It's the most fun I've had in an arcade style game in a very long time. Don't let the simple graphics fool you, there's a very well thought out combat system here. You win a round and then try to advance screens in your direction so if you want to try to avoid combat after you win a round you can be a coward and beeline for the finish. Ok, enough typing, I have fast paced fencing to get to.			"

												It's fun, it's a nice casual game, but... It not worth $15.The content is really minimal, and you'll be done with everything in something like 2 hours.It's based around the idea of playing it with friends (local and online) but... It's just hard to play for more than 30 minutes due to it's repetivity.			"

												Give me a moment here, I want to make sure I don't miss any of these. Ahem:•	WINNER: Indiecade Game Design, 2013•	WINNER: IGF | GDC Nuovo Award, 2011•	WINNER: Eurogamer Expo, RPS Indie Game of the Show, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Excellence in Design, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Bloodsport of the Year: 2010•	FINALIST: IGF | GDG Excellence in Design, 2011•	FINALIST: IGF | GDC Grand Prize, 2011Those are the nominations and awards the newly released indie fighter, Nidhogg has listed on their home page. It was enough to make me pick it up without hesitation.I don't often define the quality of a video game by how many awards it's won, but when I start losing the ability to count them on my hands, apparently I do. A good thing, too. Nidhogg is all kinds of awesome.A DUEL TO THE DEATHThe concept is remarkably simple: 2 players go head-to-head in a half duel/half race to the death, both equipped with fencing swords and capable of more than a few tricks to give an edge in battle. You begin facing your opponent in the 'middle' of a map, with an opening battle. Battles are fast and furious beyond imagining, often ending within a few seconds, which ties into the gameplay mechanic wonderfully: upon killing your opponent they'll need to wait a moment to respawn, allowing you to press forward toward your 'goal'. Win a battle and you're given the 'goal light' allowing you to move forward further; lose, and your opponent gains it instead. So long as you maintain the previous kill you can pass-by your opponent without engaging and edge closer to your goal - should they fail to stop your approach.This 'tug-o-war' mechanic is the single most endearing indie game element I've felt in a while. It's relentless, and the feeling of achievement after finally managing to push an opponent back to the end, before summarily being eaten by Nidhogg, is one of much glory and admiration. Simple, sure. But so very, very rewarding. Easy to learn, too, and likely near-impossible to master.MATCH MADE IN HELLSingle-Player Mode consists of fighting steadily more challenging opponents, one after another, on one of 4 maps. So, naturally, if you want to be playing Nidhogg for more than a few hours, you're going to need to go multiplayer.Sadly, the online matchmaking within Steam isn't great. Assuming you can actually find a game, there's a good chance one of you will be lagging horribly — and when you're playing the type of game that you can't play with even the slightest amount of lag, matches can often lead to aggravating experiences. Assuming you have a few friends playing, and you're all within the same global region, this won't be a huge problem. And if you're lucky enough to have more than a few friends playing, then Tournament Mode will likely give you the greatest experience of all. I know, personally, playing live on Twitch, that this feature will make for 99% of all my time playing. WORTH A BUY?At $15~ I can only recommend a purchase here for players with friends planning to play with them - for now, at least. Which is largely a shame, as the gameplay offered in Nidhogg is truly exceptional.Possible improvements include visual upgrades to characters to simulate some form of character progression; as it stands, every game is the same and with 4 maps there's limited variety. You'll be relying on your opponents to entertain you; if they do, you're going to love Nidhogg, if not, you're likely going to get very bored, very quick.ABOUT THE AUTHORCody Hargreaves, better known as  Excessive Profanity[twitch.tv], has been writing reviews and articles in the gaming industry for 7 years, across various websites and publications.

												While by modern standards Nidhogg is minimalistic in both features and aesthetic, the joy and entertainment derived from gradually learning its frenetic, deliberate, and simple combat system is enough for me to consider this one of the best indie fighting games I've ever played. Though it is admittedly lacking in level or character selection, what's present is beautifully realized, from the abstract woodland creatures gambolling in the tall grass to the vortex of light pulsing behind cloud bridges. The soundtrack, while only comprised of four tracks, is perfectly suited to the technicolor slaughter.The game offers online play, but I would only recommend this if you're planning to joust in-person. Any amount of latency would kill the pinprick precision integral to the swordplay. Like any good fighting game, the best part is learning and adapting with each match, and there's little else sweeter than witnessing your opponent wince and hearing the spectators clamor after a meticulously-timed riposte (or a rude and random divekick, whatever works). It succeeds equally well as both a cuthroat, competitive tournament game and a night drinking's casual diversion.			"

												Short and Sweet Version:  This game is very basic.  You try to go one way, the other guy the other way.  The controls aren't nearly as tight as I would like them (or perhaps too tight?).  And the sound track to doing this back and forth non-sense is very repetitive and uninspiring.  The sounds are about what you'd expect, but perhaps a grade below that and the gameplay, although as responsive (sometimes, sometimes not) is about what you'd expect.I would price this title at $3.  If you spend any more than that, you'll feel as cheated as I currently do.Overall - very disappointed for what I paid for it.			"

If you're in the same room, you can play on the same keyboard or have someone on the keys and the other on a gamepad. The controls are easy to pick up, but the gameplay is just so addictive. Can't beat the feeling of disarming the other guy and watching the spray of pixels when you poke him. It's more than a simple fencing game. It's a back and forth struggle full of swordplay, chases, and satisfying comebacks.			"

												In short, a game of tug-o-war with a variation. A neat side scroll-er with a simple game play idea and graphic. Nidhogg with wonderful controller support is a game that mirrors fencing and you must defeat your opponent and advance to the next stage. When you defeat an opponent, you only have so much time to run to the next stage before he reincarnates. The controllers are simple which include hitting an opponents body or head... and if you catch their swords on an up sweep you can disarm them. You also have the ability to throw your sword. It's a neat game, it's fun for what it is, but the fun doesn't last extremely long. Only reason I got it was it was listed as local co-op. I'll recommend it but with caution.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												This game is very well-made. I say this because it requires skill to play, is fast-paced, has wonderful backgrounds, and simply has an interesting and fun concept behind it. It's also very satisfying to fake out your opponent with a tricky sword maneuver and jam a rapier through his head. Additionally, the soundtrack is phenomenal! However, the replayability of the game is limited, as there are only four maps and the online multiplayer is a bit rough around the edges (it's much better and more responsive while playing local multiplayer or singleplayer), and once you beat the singleplayer campaign you need friends who enjoy playing it as much as you do. Overall, I would highly recommend this game, as it is entertaining, satisfying, and while it is easy to learn, it is difficult to master (but very rewarding when you get it down pat). I actually have more hours on record than Steam reports I do, because I've played it on a different computer and the transfer of playtime between computers was not very good; I have about 10 hours more than the amount shown above invested in this game, and I still play it and recommend it heartily. Well worth the money, and well worth the time you'll spend playing it.			"

												Right now, not worth the price, at all.  The game isn't even true 16x9 widescreen, game has unexplainable lagspikes on my brand new 700 series GPU Gaming Laptop.  And the combat itself feels more frantic and ""beat to the punch"" based than actual super fast paced methodical skill-based combat.  Has good ideas, and my opinions can change on the complexity and eventual mastery, but right now it's just ""feels"" too frenetic to be any real skill-based 3rd Strike (if you will) type gameplay.  So it's a good pick up and play game.  Soundtrack wise, it leaves a lot to be desired.  nothing really to say there, nothing is really good at all...Visually, it's a minimalist type paintery style, sort of, but I don't particularly think it excentuates the raw gameplay as much as another artstyle could.  But heh, it's unique, and it looks alright.  Multiplayer should be fun at least.  Anyway, just my first impressions.  But definitely not worth a $15 pricetag imo, much better games at cheaper or exactly that price.  And Volgarr The Viking remains the undisputed king of recent Indie games recently with Race The Sun at #2 imo.  So anyway, yeah, 7/10 if you want a score.			"

												I have a about an hour or two in this game, but don't let that discourage you. GAMEPLAY: Niddhog has very good gameplay, easy to learn but difficult to master at its finest. You hold your rapier in three positions, low, mid, and high. You can strike from any of these positions, and if you hit your opponent who is at the same guard as your attack, it'll be parried. Moving your blade up/down onto your opponent's guard will also disarm them. You can throw your rapier, do a jump-kick, and do a sweep while crouched. You can also roll on the ground, which has the implication of rolling under a high-guard and getting behind your opponent. Overall, the combat is good. Also, each unique stage has special areas and can be used to your advantage. Such as the cloud level where you can fall down if you don't move. GRAPHICS: The graphics, although ""pixellated"", are aesthetically pleasing. However this is where the game starts to fall. The second ""cloud"" level, is very, very bright and flashes very fast. I'm not epileptic, but I was straining to see in this level and I have no idea how an epileptic would deal with it. But otherwise they're good. COMMUNITY: Now here's where the game falls apart further. It has a good, active community. However this is useless as the netcode for the game literally doesn't work. There is no online play, so you can only play locally/LAN. A game that'd otherwise have a very long life is made a gimmick because of this. There are no multiplayer tournaments, matches with friends, or community events. In this sense, the game's simplicity kills itself as it doesn't last when playing alone. The game is good, but I can't recommend it. Due to the non-existant support post-launch, the broken netcode, and lack of news about the game gives it a bleak future. 5/10, good game but it's average.			"

Posted: September 25, 2014
												I really WANTED to like this game. I'd heard such great things about it, and it seemed like it should be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it was just let down.First, the gameplay. Nidhogg has simple but slightly awkward controls that certainly can be mastered but aren't particularly fluid on their own. If you're expecting fighting-game style precision, you're going to be disappointed. Once you get past the tutorial, the movement options feel fuzzy and unreliable. The basic combat is... okay. Most actions happen so quickly that it's humanly impossible to react to them, so it's mostly about anticipation and taking risks, and be prepared for a number of frustrating deaths where it doesn't even look like you were touched by the opponent's sword.I realize that everything I just wrote is directly contrary to what most other critics are saying about the game, but I can only call it like I see it. I've played plenty of other games in this niche, and they all felt better than Nidhogg.The one place where the game is fun is local co-op, which is the entire point of the game I suppose, but it's fun for the ""wrong"" reasons. Playing with a group of friends makes all of the ""screw you, that was stupid"" moments fun, because you  all get to taunt each other the whole time. So basically, the game is fun with friends precisely *because* of the stupid and lopsided moments that in any other situation would just be frustrating.Claims that the game's graphics are ""beautiful"" are overstated. There are one or two impressive setpieces that will probably catch your eye, but the game as a whole isn't particularly nice-looking. The style is unique and expressive, but it's not objectively pleasing by any measure. Also, the game really needs a colorblind setting, because my character is practically invisible to me against the backdrop of the second stage.My final complaint, which others have echoed, is that there's not nearly enough content to justify the $15 price tag. I normally don't mind paying a little extra for a good game, but this is definitely more of a $5 title. If it's on sale for that much and you're looking for a new game to play at parties, maybe this is for you, but otherwise you're not missing much by passing it up.			"

												First things first:This is a party-game, meaning it´s supposed to be played with many people on a couch, screaming, laughing. Think Smash Bros, Towerfall, Samurai Gunn, etc. Don´t fret though because the game does have online multiplayer.The simple goal of Nidhogg is to get into the endzone, that´s it. Too bad your opponent has the exact same goal.What ensues is a glorious tug of war, because who ever got the last kill is the only one who can proceed. And killing there will be lots of, because besides being a race for the goal, Nidhogg also excells at being a Prince of Persia-style fencing game. Although appearing rather simple, the fighting system is pretty deep and complex with parries, blocks, feints, jumps, rolls, wallmoves, different attack stances, you can even throw your blade at your opponent. All of this lightning-fast action is presented in a very stylized fashion, reminescent of the good old days of the Commodore 64 and it fits the game perfectly. Animations are fluent (and very gory in a cartoony way), backgrounds are very retro and sometimes deliberately convoluted or hard to see your character in. Though featuring only 4 Stages on the date of this review, it´s more than enough to get going and further deepens the Retro-Arcady-Feel of this game (yes, leaving things out can actually give a product more character rather than taking it away)Sound and music are nothing to write home about but they get the job done with little screams and clangs here and there.Nidhogg is a game it would definetely reccomend if you grew up with titles like Barbarian, International Karate (Karateka) or even the wonderful Moonstone (which NEEDS a remake). It´s fast, deep, satisfying, a definite skill- AND mindgame when it comes to the fencing. People looking for a lot of content and fancy graphics will surely be turned off by this game but tournament-fighters and retro-fans should try it.One final word about the pricing, I can understand that 11 bucks (or how much that may be in $) is a steep price but devs gotta live too and I´m sure it will be in a sale sooner or later. So consider helping the guys (the guy?) from Messhoff out by getting it right now!			"

												 I just had a five minute one-on-one duel with a random person.  It can be ♥♥♥♥in’ INTENSE.  You can die and respawn as many times as you like.  The goal is to get to the end of the level in whatever direction you have to go, right for me, left for him.  Stab, jump, kick, punch your way through him.  Even if the game ends up with him almost winning, you can push your way back to your end of the level just because it becomes so nerve racking for the other person that a chance for you to push back opens up and you make a mad dash for the right side of the screen.  The battle wages on room through room, back and forth.  Orange and Yellow blood bathes the floor while sword upon sword exchange hands as they are thrown through the air.  A lucky stab in the face brings your opponent’s hands to your sword as you stand still for but a moment, the character grasping at the sword.  You thrust forward and the color orange floods the floor below.  You run forward.  He spawns in the doorway ahead of you.  You can’t throw your sword.  You have to charge him.  You see that he has put his sword just too high.  You charge.  You duck and roll all the way through the doorway and stand and stab him in the back.  You keep running.  He spawns again, this time getting a lucky sword throw to your face.  Lives are traded.  you finally make it to the next room.  You are beating him.  This is your territory.  The ground is clean of blood and swords.  you charge.  he spawns just before a pit and makes a nervous jump, falling to his doom.  You laugh!  You wait for him to respawn as he recollects himself.  You both realize that that pitfall was a mistake.  An honorable man lets your opponent have a fair fight.   You beat him.  As he dissolves in to orange goo behind you, you run for the final screen.

He knows you could win if you get past him.  You make a jump.  You dive kick in to him.  His sword goes left, his body crumples.  You charge to the right.  he runs to the left, hoping to respawn before you can make it across to the end of the map.  He respawns.He knows your tricks.  he knows you will jump above him as he spawns, sending your foot in to his face.  He is ready.  You know he knows your plans.  You prepare for the inevitable.  There is no time to change plans.  You must act.  You jump.He jumps.One of you will press the kick button at the right time.  If you press it at the wrong time, he will kick you to the ground and rip your proud head off your yellow neck.  You kick.  Your feet meet his feet.  He falls.  You charge.The croud is doing the wave in your favor.  You have done it.  You bow to your opponent.  Your hands are sweating.  You crawl to the finish line, barely able to stand.A giant worm flies towards you.  You are eaten whole.WINNER.			"

												I will recommend this game for the near perfection of a duel.  It offers strategy, depth, and no overly complex rules.  It's very well put together and can make some amazing situations.As always there are things to watch out for:Technical issues-  These are not too terrible, but be preprared in every 3rd or 4th game to lose or win a fight due to a network hiccup.  As always I assume they'll be fixed as I played this near release.No idea the future:There's no communication on what the future for this game is now. There's a great game here, but all games have room to grow. I have no idea if any improvements are incoming.Complaints I would not worry about from other people.Only 4 maps.  Consider it like a fighting game.  They may have 12 maps, but it's really a background swap.  Here each 4 maps represents a completely different battlefield.  If people clamour that much for more maps they could easily doa pallet swap and call it a day.			"

												This game is fantastic. Super simple, but has a lot of strategic depth. Matches are a quick tug-of-war game of fencing, but can turn into epic bouts with mindful opponents. If you like PVP at all, and are looking for a game that can be a ton of fun without a big time commitment, you can't go wrong with this. Online play is fun but it's best doing Local Co Op with a friend.			"

												If you have some local friends to play with, this game is excellent. The combat is surprisingly deep and even after a few days I still find it really fun to play in a local setting. Spectating people chanting and cheering when someone is disarmed and slain is one of the things that just can't be coded in to the game. Eight player tournaments are also spectacular, but this is an even less likely scenario for most prospective buyers. There is a single player game that is adequate for times where you'd like to play but have no one to play with for the moment, but this mode is not nearly as interesting as battling with other humans.Yes, there is an option to play online. However, online multiplayer still has a lot of issues that seem to vary between being ""fine"" and ""massive desync; abort everything"". It's a shame, but I can't recommend this game that doesn't treat this game as a local multiplayer game the time being. There may be a day where that's untrue, maybe even soon, where it'll be absolutely fine online. Until then, consider this game only if you have at least one other person to play with. If you are willing to slog through some horrible connection problems with some people, there may be some fun matches to have, but the cost-benefit of that could potentially be very low.In short: great game for local multiplayer. Very interesting and fun mechanics. Promising online multiplayer that is currently very unreliable.			"

												Nidhogg is about competitive dueling. I first played EggNogg that was way more hilarious with the swords bouncing around, so I entered Nidhogg disappointed as it was more 'bland' and the different parts of each level are too short to allow longer play and more frequent comebacks. EggNogg had one single level with more variety inside, while Nidhogg has less variety inside a single level but more variety overall with the different levels and their unique twists (grass field to hide in the Wilds, narrow corridors and moving floor in the Mines, concealing clouds and bright colors in the Clouds, and a few pits plus a big central area in the Castle). I will give something important to Nidhogg over EggNogg though: the controls are more reactive and the game is more balanced. It feels good to play, and it leaves a lot of room for improving skill and reading the moves of the opponent. (Edit: However EggNogg+ now has reactive controls that even includes wall-jumps!)So what else does Nidhogg have? AI players for a single player mode, these opponents are actually quite good and each AI seems to have its own way to fight and unpredictable movements. Good point here. There are nice local multiplayer additions such as an 8 player tournament mode, and the possibility to change the game rules for local 1 on 1.Last but not least, there is an online multiplayer mode. Having friends to play with seems like the only reasonable way, as the matchmaking is literally empty and on the rare occasions that there is someone else playing, expect painful lag as they are likely at the other side of the world.So then, here comes the big question. Why am I not recommending this game? I enjoy playing it, I want it to have more success but.... It took so many years and does not seem polished enough. It is not possible to change the color of the players, my logitech controllers are not recognized by the game, the different areas in each level are too short to allow for more tense play (the central area in the castle is the best place for comebacks and tension building up), the online part of the game has the merit to exist but didn't get enough love, there are no arrows at the start of the game to show who is who, and, for all of that, I find that the game is too expensive for what it is. And apparently I'm not the only one thinking that way, seeing all the comments in the forum and the fact that the online multiplayer is quite empty.I can only recommend this game on sale or if you know you will often have friends over to enjoy the duels. I realize that I am too severe because I probably expected too much and the free game EggNogg biased my judgment a lot, but Nidhogg was around for a long time and the result still lacks polish. Although I guess that it is expensive to compensate for the small niche market. But a fundamental issue for me is the lack of players online, and the insane lag on the rare moments that a player is found (it can even happen often to see the same scene rewind with each time a different player dying, wtf?).

												Entertaining, but the game desperately needs additional features and some bug fixing before I could ever recommend it, or play for more than the odd rare match.  Online multiplayer is incredibly laggy, there is no option for local lan play which I see as a huge omission, there is no way of directly choosing to play with a friend so you can't arrange to play people, and the menus need better mouse support or a different UI entirely.But, the gameplay is there, and that's the biggest hurdle.  The aesthetic is solid, the gamemodes are varied and interesting, it's got most of what it needs to be a good multiplayer game between friends.  It could be lots of fun, if they could make it so you could actually play with those friends without dealing with 20 rounds of matchmaking roulette to get paired and a ruberbanding stuttery mess when you finally play.  It's just pretty hard to actually enjoy the game.  I hope for future updates, but I'm not holding my breath.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game *is* fun. However, at full price, in my opinion, it isn't worth it: You need to play multiplayer to have any real enjoymentThe barebones graphics are bland rather than charming, the levels repeat (3 levels)There is an easy exploit (run, roll, strike).If this game *was* $1, it is okay... but I have payed for and played **MUCH** better games at the same price.The positive aspects of this game: The controls (on XBox controller) are *great*!It's great fun to play with a friend (but gets boring quickly)Very cool idea... it just needs more to it. This feels like the base of a greater game. If this game is on sale, and you want a good local multiplayer game to stab your friends with... go for it.However, on it's own, I do not recommend this game.			"

												Only get this game when it's on sale (-75%)! It's a fun multiplayer game. You can confidently play it during a house party and you'll see that it'll be a hit (though I only did it once since the game ""Broforce"" is much more entertaining at house parties)! Also note that the achievements are very easy to get (except one, which is super hard, bordering on impossible).

												Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends. However, if you like to play with your friends, then this game is for you, but if you do not like the local multiplayer, I still recommend that the game is not very long, this needs improvement.In Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row. After you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, the first one being the easiest and the last one. I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.As I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates. The art style is what I love the most about this game, the player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone. On the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches.

												Let's start this review slightly differently. This is an amazing game and you should be ashamed you're not playing it right now. I think many of you will agree that there are very few genres that can compete with fighting games when it comes to a local multiplayer experience. While RPGs, FPSs and RTSs are usually played alone with headphones on, it's the fighting games that not brings the whole circle of friends together. And the neighbours as well, since they're jarateed off that you are still shouting for several hours straight. Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Skullgirls - these games are the first ones that come to mind whenever you think about playing together on the same couch with your buddies. Hell, even on the Wii, that's notorious for being the best console to play with your buddies in the same room, the best selling game that's not Sports or Mario is... Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A fighting game. The sheer competitiveness of fighting one-to-one or two versus two is already thrilling and excitement-filling, but the possible moves, combinations and strategies can leave an incredible impression to anyone. And Nidhogg, well, is a fighting game. Kind of.Truth to be told, it's a fighting game in the purest form. No different characters. No varied movesets. Perfect. Symmetry. Both players get to play as a diffent-colored fighter. Part stickman, part pixel-man(?), he wields a sword of sorts. It's probably a rapier. I mean, you stab the other part stickman, part pixel-man with it. The stages are perfectly symmetrical as well, meaning that the only advantage you can get is the one you build yourself.The gameplay isn't traditional in fighting game sense: two players try to stab/divekick/rip-spine-off one another. Such actions result in an instant-kill. Although this is not quite near the Divekick level, where one touch means someone is dead already, the fights rarely last more than a few seconds. Once the morbid deed has been done and your opponent is bleeding all over the place, a huge GO! arrow appears in the direction where your opponent should be. If he was alive, that is. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves slightly and now your opponent has respawned, standing a few meters away from you, weapon ready. Kill him, see the arrow, run towards the arrow, move screen even more. In a way, this might remind you of those classic beat-'em-ups, where you have to punch down all the guys in the screen, see the GO! arrow appear and then move the screen slightly, getting yourself an inch closer to victory. The process in Nidhogg is pretty similar, except that in the way of killing>running towards arrow>killing, you will most likely be pierced like a kebab and left pouring blood all over the carpet. If such an accident happens, and it will, a GO! arrow will still appear. This time, for your opponent. If you fail enough times and get killed more, the screen will move to the final stage. Dying here will usually mean that your opponent wins. As he runs towards victory, you block his initial lunge, jump to the air and land on his head. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ manages to roll back and pick up his rapier. However, this time, he is on the defensive, while you are free to run towards him, roll just under his blade and swipe his feet, knocking your foe down. It all culminates with a glorified spine-rip, with extra crunchy sound effects as a bonus. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves and you feel a little bit more relieved, knowing that you managed to push away your fate slightly farther away.Such is the beatiful fencing of Nidhogg, where you use the responsive and fluid control to out-skill and out-wit your opponent. Fights last mere seconds, but they are just as exciting as a whole round of Street Fighter. You'll never feel cheated if you die, since you were not out-gunned. I mean, who the hell picks Chun Li while playing with your friends, anyway!? Erm, sorry. The whole game can be controlled by 6 buttons - 4 for movement and 2 for attacking. It's incredibly simple and easy to pick up, but just like the aforementioned Divekick, this game is immensely complex. With a few button combinations, you can jump, divekick, roll, cartwheel (!), taunt, throw you goshdarned rapier into the unsuspecting victim's face and more.Not only the fencing is beautiful, however. The arenas you fight in are as well. There is some variety and creativity here and there, but not too much to distract you from the true goal. To appeal to the mighty Nidhogg. Oh, forgot to mention him! Reader, meet Nidhogg, the giant pink nordic dragon-snake-thingy that eats you once you win. All jokes aside, this game is filled with incredible design decisions, even if some of them are accidental. Even the mere fact that the whole point of the game is to get EATEN with a loud *CRUNCH* sound following makes this game perfect for parties. Sure, your opponent won after that hard match and he might have been using his cheap running technique, but he got eaten. The silly Nidhogg's eyes are enough to soften up even the sorest losers. And the awesome design doesn't stop there. The sound effects are great to cheer people up as well. Alongside the general rapier sounds, you also get a whole bunch of *slash*, *slush* and *GWEAAAARRRRGHHHhhhh...* as well. After your opponent misjudges his distance and divekicks right in front of your rapier, impaling himself, it's hard for both to contain laughter after the poor sod releases a complimentary *Erghhwgghhht...* This game also has flaws, as hard it might be to confess. Single-player is pretty much a glorified training mode (aren't most fighting games like that?) with an easily exploitable AI and online-multiplayers suffers from latency issues. However, playing anything but local multiplayer on this game is just a crime against it. Still, the number of stages is underwhelming and Steam Workshop support could help it. Another minor complaint would be that you can't pick your own color during offline multiplayer, only tournament mode.Nidhogg can create new friendships. Nidhogg can strenghthen existing ones. And most likely Nidhogg will. Dueling with a buddy, be it you two are playing for the first time or this is your fifth hundredth match, is just simply a blast, filled with laughter, joy, shouts and pixelated blood. But it's even more fun to play with even more friends. Up to 8 player tournament mode is incredible (and the winner gets something more awesome than being eaten by a worm) and while two are locked in an intense duel, the others can shoutcast, cheer or pick favorites. It's an incredible party game. Tim is strategic, trying to roll under your feet and disarm you. Mike is wrong in the head and he thinks that throwing your only weapon in vain hopes to kill is the best way to win. He's probably right. Johnny? He's an♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to run around the opposition, instead of fighting head-on. Steve is good at dive-kicking. He'll dive-kick when he has the upper hand and when he doesn't. He'll dive-kick anytime. Oh, there's also me, the sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, who rolls around the floor using the same move he calls ""Cartwheel assassin"" trying to sneakily stab you once you're distracted.All of these strategies work. All of them are viable. All of them can win games and they HAVE won games.There are no tier-lists in Nidhogg. There are no combo sheets either. Just pure fun. If you, dear reader, think that this isn't a fighting game, you're probably right as well. But all I care is that Nidhogg is the best local multiplayer game you could ever play.			"

												I personally think that this game is excellent gameplay-wise, but I also see quite a few flaws.Pros:-Very addicting-Multiplayer-Rare yet astounding turn-arounds-Unique gameplay-Just plain funCons:-Limited to only 4 maps-Repetative-Controls may be a bit hard to learn-Costs $15Conclusion:I think that this is a great game. It's mainly the price that's the big problem. If it costed maybe about $5, then the cons could be neutralized by the low price, with the exception of the Controls con. I truly hope that the developers continue to work on this game, and give all players an amazing experience.			"

												Really Really fun little 2d fencing sim. Its got a great combat system that I think successfully emulates what it is like to fence and an interesting and surreal artstyle and setting to boot. Be patient with the game though because the single player can be very frusterating. The AI DOES NOT ♥♥♥♥ around in this game and you will be defeated a lot. The multiplayer is excellent as well, all thanks to the great and complex combat system that I mentioned earlier.			"

												9/10Nidhogg is an amazing game, wether the pricetag turns you off or not. This game perfectly revives old arcade style fights with your friends. This game is one of the most intense you will play in a long time. Locally, this game is a wonder and something that everyone will have a blast with. The graphics are simplistic enough that they do not distract from the gameplay, which the game revolves around in the first place. The controls are quick and easy to hop into. Within the first five minutes of the game, you will learn every move the game has to offer, from divekicks to somersaults. The concept of Nidhogg sometimes makes it feel like a boardgame; having a strict set of rules and goals but hundreds of different ways to achieve them. Although the meat of the game purely revolves around playing with other people, the AI is actually very fun to play against in the singleplayer. Obviously, they goof sometimes, but they will often be fun to play with and be a slight challenge at least. This game is great with friends and even the matchmaking is pretty swell. What takes away from this game is purely how laggy the multiplayer can be in some cases. Few matchmaking games will be laggy, but private games that you are invited to can be atrocious. If you have the money, I highly recommend Nidhogg, especially if you have people to enjoy it with.			"

												Took me about 48 minutes to beat the singleplayer, and then I played some of the multiplayer. There aren't many people online (4 were matchmaking at the time) but I still found a match relativley quickly. The tutorial is broken at the momment, but just looking at the control configuration gives you an idea of things.The game is pretty straight forward, you kill the enemy player and advanced towards your goal before they respawn infront of you. Once you get to the end you sacrafice yourself to a giant worm to entertain a crowd and win. It's a tug of war game with swords and it's rather fun doing crazy moves like disarming your opponents or kicking them off cliffs.I heard the multiplayer was really laggy for some people, but it seems playable if you're playing with somebody on the same continent. I expereinced a bit of delay in my moves but did alright against a random player.If you're hurting for cash, I probably wouldn't recommend spending more than 10 dollars on this game unless you are planning on playing it with a friend, I'm assuming that's where most of the fun comes from.If this game every goes for sale at a cheap price, I'd defintiley recommend it. It's very entertaining.			"

												It would be a fun game with a pretty deep fighting mechanic. The fencing is fun and we don't see a whole lot of those. And it's pretty nice and whacky in local. Too bad the online aspect is so hideously broken. This game uses P2P netcode that was made from whatever backwater developer had leftover. I understand it's not going to be on the level of GGPO, I get that. There's going to be imperfect lag. But this is position-switching lag on a grand scale. This is the computer animating your death, then your opponents death, then you falling on a cliff, all in around 15 seconds. This is unforgivable. Don't play this The music is redeeming, but that's about it. The developers should have fixed this a long time ago. I dread whatever new abomination they create.			"

Based on the amount of fun I've had so far, it is without question worth picking up to play with your friends.

												With 25 hours into this game, I find it difficult to recommend in its current state.  The single player experience is barebones and really just a training ground for the Multiplayer experience.If you are playing this locally with a buddy, then GET THIS GAME.  Controls are tight as Sh*t, matches are fun, and enough settings to tweak to keep things lively.   If you are playing this online, DO NOT get this game.  Nidhogg has issues finding you anyone to play, and if you are lucky enough to get paired with someone after a 10 minute wait, theres a 50-50 chance the connection will be too laggy to play.Its sad that a game geared for multiplayer implemented such a poor online experience, killing its customer base.

												This game is ill and represents the poverty gaming label quite strongly. Should be a standard for all poverty and poverty-related (mystery game) tournaments.1) Gameplay is strong and simple. Easy to play, difficult to master. The fact it was brought out to major tournaments has developed a small cult following as a result.2) Art style is simple and effective. Concentrating on the meat of the game, which is gameplay.3) It brings the hype. Plain and simple.It brings some of the best mechanics from fighting games. Simplicty in mechanics. Parrying, low sweeps, divekicking, roll dodging, throwing. All optional to use, but when used effectively will lead to victory. Rewarding good reactions and good reads. Of course, one could totally avoid fights all together to victory as well. This leaves many options open towards fighting.I would bring this to local tournaments. Nuff said.			"

Good for short sessions - not more. Why can people not create their own levels? - The movements are a nightmare and require quite a lot of experience (you WILL jump in that pit more times than you'd like to)- The singleplayer game is... ah welll...

												My girlfriend practices fencing so I got this for us to play as a joke. What I failed to realize was how much fun it would be and how much I'd be laughing during our bouts. It's got that same quick gameplay and strategic timing of old school vs arcade games like Joust. The graphics even herald of the golden days of pixel based gaming. It is just you vs the computer or another player and you have to advance all the way to the enemies side of the battlefield across several screens. Your only weapon is a fencing foil that you can hold high, level or low and depending on the positioning you will have an advantage when swining at the enemy, a disadvantage, or a cancel/parry. Throw in a jump, a roll, a throw, and the ability to punch/kick when disarmed and you have a simple move set that is difficult to level against your enemy if they are every bit as conniving as you. It's a great game to play with friends, and though it doesn't have lasting appeal, it's always fun to throw in for a quick match as a palette cleanser betwee other multiplayer games. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it.			"

Nidhogg is appealing in so many ways.In fact, it's a game full of so many good design choices, that it's a shame it is often overlooked. Gameplay is easy to grasp, but leaves the player with a lot of room to fine-tune how they approach combat. It's a tug-of-war that rewards strategy, and which lends itself to some really satisfying wins. Coupled with colourful, stylized pixel-art - and a soundtrack that's unconventional, but incredibly catchy - I have a hard time complaining about any of Nidhogg's design elements.However, it suffers from the same problem that a game like Gang Beasts does (in its current state): for a game that is so clearly meant to be played with friends or a community, multiplayer is just far too inaccessible. Matchmaking in Nidhogg is painfully vacant. But where a game like Gang Beasts is making strides towards things like community building and online play, Nidhogg has already moved passed them.So, while I recommend Nidhogg to anyone looking for something easy to pick up, challenging, visually striking, and relatively cheap; they'd better be prepared to play it alone.

												Best enjoyed in local versus mode despite its lack of a ""shared/splitscreen"" official Steam tag. Nidhogg is a simple concept; You kill your opponent you get to move forward progressing level screens, he kills you, he gets to move forward. First one to reach the end screen their designated direction wins. This makes for a great tug of war, insane comebacks, and thrilling grudge matches. They tried to give the combat some nuance with the ability to hold your fencing sword at three heights (plus throw) but like any basic player vs player combat it comes down to timing more than anything. All the technique in the world isn't gonna stop somebody from timing the perfect roll or jump to run right past you. And that's where the game gets interesting. Besides the beginning stalemate for the first kill, combat only hangs on the ""defender"". Once you get your kill and control the ability to press forward, that's what your focus is on. Many times its better to just get past your opponent and continue your run rather than engage. It really levels the playing field and makes it fairly easy for anybody to pick up and enjoy. Then you toss in four levels with decent variety and things stay interesting enough for a competitive sitdown.With the advent of in-home streaming, HTPC's, etc. Nidhogg finds a comfortable home in the living room to get the competitive juices flowing with friends and family on the ""bigscreen"". I'm a fan of local shared/split-screen games on the PC that are done well. And while utterly basic and simple (and thus probably overpriced) this delivers pure fun. Wait for a sale, but if you like making temporary enemies with friends on the couch, this is good stuff. Recommended.			"

												Absolutely awesome, but ONLY if you have pals to play it with and the controllers to support yourselves. The netcode is a joke and playing with a keyboard is a chore. If you can round up a posse, then this is one of the best local multiplayer games in the bidness, even with its limited content, the surprisingly deep gameplay is more than enough to support a lot of time playing with friends.

												Recommended, but ONLY ON SALE.+ The game has this old-school, pixellated charm of splitting your opponent in two in the funniest ways. + The whole completely absurd experience drives you a little bit insane and I could not help laughing nervously when striding with friends in the multiplayer mode. But I guess this *is* a good feeling.However.- The netcode seems buggy and the people I played with experienced lags, which hindered their playing experience.- Only 4 levels. Good for short sessions - not more. Why can people not create their own levels? - The movements are a nightmare and require quite a lot of experience (you WILL jump in that pit more times than you'd like to)- The singleplayer game is... ah welll... I guess it's part of the fun, but actually not my cup of tea. I recommend it anyways! But on sale. 14 dollars/euros/whatever is too much for this.			"

												Nidhogg is a fast pace fencing game with tug-of-war elements. However in this tug of war you don't just have to fight and kill the oposition. You can evade his blade to by pass the opponent compleatly, but watch out as one quick thrust or thrown sword can cause your body to erupt in colorful blood all over the stage. As you become a better nidhogg-er you can pull off some sick plays by reading your opponent's habits and punish them. The cost of the game may be high for an indie title but having a good friend either next to you or in a call is the best experience I have had in a long time. (laughed for 10+ min strait at one point) I highly recommend the game and just to note this game does have a single player mode and online mode but only has 4 stages. (castle, mine, cloud, and wild) In online mode you can do matchmaking and private matches. With okay net code you can decided on what type of experience you want from the game. Have fun and happy frog jumping (inside joke not a reccomended fighting style)			"

I first was introduced to it at IndieCade, where it was projected on a large screen with two people duking it out via arcade sticks surrounded by a cheering crowd, and that is where this game thrives. You can play it by yourself, but that's not the point. You can also play it via online multiplayer, which is better, but it still thrives only when there's an audience, or at least when you can yell at the person you're fighting against. The game is brutal, fast paced, quick to pick up, and insanely fun. Just know that you'll need other people to play with (I mean, it comes with a built-in tournament mode).			"

												Grab a few friends for an online tournament and you can have fun for hours with Nidhogg, but not days. This game is sadly a one-trick pony and you'll feel the brand-new game buzz wear pretty damn thin much quicker than you'd like. If you look past the shear lack of longevity to this game, you can no doubt appreciate the nice visual take on a classic look and the quirky and fresh (in the modern gaming world anyway) style of gameplay. If you're looking for a fun indie game to play solo (for more than an hour or two at least), in my opinion, this isn't it.6/10Pros/Cons+ Gameplay is fluent, intense and varied enough for a well-balanced and fun showdown.+ Classical visuals matched with frantic visual effects and modern music make for an interesting mix.+ With friends this game creates rivalries and offers a few hours of fun gaming full of laughs.+ The crossover between Nordic mythology and fencing is so miss matched it adds to the games charm. - Has to be one of the most repetitive games I've played with no variation in gameplay whatsoever.- There is such little content even for the select game types with only 4 environments available.- For the price of this game, you'd expect much more from it and not just a glamorised minigame.- The single player mode is tiring to work through whilst multiplayer options are just as limiting due to content.

												A brilliant, balanced, entertaining game. Manages to capture the utmost excitement most games can achieve in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds, time and time again. A balanced, simplistic game built upon skill and reflexes, there are only 7 attacks and each has a potential counter resulting in death. This game is easy to learn, hard to master, and playing with friends is epic. I have only played this game for an hour but I am already hooked, I would recommend this to anyone who has ever liked Smash Bros, Street Fighter or any game similar. Actually  would recommend this to anyone who enjoys competition, which is what this game focuses on. For what it is it I have to give it 10/10, it's wonderful.			"

												I do fencing as an amateur and I have to say, technique and physical ability aside, Nidhogg captures brilliantly everything that represents the real spirit of fencing: the unnerving waits to lure your adversary into attacking you, the sudden resolutions, the continuous pushing back and forth, the quick clashes that make you go ""WTF JUST HAPPENED?"", the giant worm that eats the winner at the end.Main flaw, the game boasts ""full controller support"" but that's full only in a world where XBox controllers are the only controllers (hint: we're not in such a world). So to actually achieve that ""full controller support"" just download a software like JoyToKey. Other than that, it's kinda repetitive contentwise, I haven't seen matches in online multiplayer, and if you play too much local multiplayer you're going to lose friends fast. It's as ragequit inducing as they come when you lose many times in a row. Maybe not worth its full price, but while it's on sale, the genius minimalistic design and gameplay make it definitely a little gem.			"

												Nidhogg is a great little indie swordfighting game. The fighting mechanics feel a lot like divekick where they're simple to learn but very tough to master. The animations and visuals are absolutely stunning and the audio track just enhances the atmosphere. I have experience latency issues with multiplayer multiple times and it would be nice to have a few more levels (currently there is 4). But overall this is a very enjoyable game that is definitely worth the pricetag.I review indie games and I did a spotlight for Nidhogg so if you want to see some gameplay consider clicking the link below, thank you :)

												Fun game, but absolutely infuriating. The gameplay is innovative and complicated, but it basically goes to waste because of the glaring flaws in its mechanics. It is far too easy to simply run past your opponent and prevent them from attacking you. All you have to do is evade their attacks when the arrow is on you and you can skip right to the end. You can also cheap-shot them if their sword isn't in the right place, making it even harder for a defender to turn the tide. It's advertised as a fencing game but it's really about trolling. If you want to get good at this strategy and use it to♥♥♥♥♥♥off everyone you play against, absolutely, buy this game. Otherwise, skip, it's not worth the price tag, especially considering how short it is.			"

												Nidhogg is solid but extremely simple - it's a nice diversion but it can't hold your attention for very long. The mechanics are cute but they get old really fast. I played the game quite a few times on Xbox, mostly local multiplayer with friends, and it was good for a few laughs, but we'd turn to something else after twenty minutes, tops. This Steam version plays the same for better or worse, but it also adds on *extremely* poor netcode. I was really shocked by how poorly the game runs online...a friend and I labored through fifteen minutes of stuttering, jerky matches that made it practically impossible to land an accurate hit or jump over a chasm. I'm struggling to understand why such a seemingly simple game would have such bad networking. There's a single player mode where you fight against a series of AI opponents, but it gets boring pretty quickly. I think that this is really a game that is meant to be played against other people...however, you won't be able to do so online.On top of these issues, this is a simple little multiplayer game that can't really be played online, so you would think the price should reflect that. Nope...it's 15 dollars or 16.99 CAD. You can read up on the game and watch some clips to decide if it is worth that price to you, but I definitely don't think it is. I actually got the game in a Humble Bundle pack so I didn't pay too much for it, but for everyone else, I'd say that this game isn't anywhere near worth a 15 dollar investment. If you're really interested in it, you should wait for a sale...but even then, remember that online play is functionally broken and the game probably won't be enough to hold your long-term interest.

												Nidhogg is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. It's complex and simple all at the same time. Once you've killed your opponent, they will respawn again in a couple seconds, and the goal is to proceed to the next screen until you reach the end of the level. After reaching the end of the level, you will defeat your opponent and move on to the next where you will fight a differently colored progressively more skilled opponent. I believe the price is a bit high simply because more people would get to enjoy the game if it were cheaper, but it is infact worth the full 15$ price tag.			"

												Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends.In Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. Maneuvers such as, rolling, dive-kicking, neck-snapping and sword-throwing are also at your disposal. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row.After you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, if you get killed, he can run to the opposite direction, this will get you back to the previous screen, and this gets really annoying because sometimes the enemy instead of fighting you, will just run past you just to get you back to the previous screen. Each ‘level’ is divided into couple smaller ones. In single player, there is a total of 17 AI opponents, the first one being the easiest and the last one, the toughest(I don’t know if that’s true but when I’ve played it, the game got harder every time with each AI opponent). At the end of each level your character is eaten by a giant dragon-like creature, by the name of Nidhogg, you can’t avoid it though(trust me, I’ve tried), I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.The art style is what I love the most about this game, it has that surreal look to it, kind of like Hotline Miami. The player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone.On the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches. You can’t even properly communicate with your opponent because the chat can’t handle longer messages.As I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates.Nonetheless, If you enjoy playing games with your friends then this game is for you but If you don’t like the local multiplayer I would still recommend sure the game isn’t very long, but the multiplayer is still there, it might be a bit lackluster but who knows maybe the devs will add some new features to the online multiplayer.

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/nidhogg-game-review/Nidhogg, also referred to as Fencing Simulator 2014 (by me, at least), is an excellent example of what a casual, multiplayer indie game should be. Be prepared to engage in very fast-paced swordplay, with friends of course.The objective in Nidhogg is very simple: reach the end of the map on the enemy's side before he/she can reach your end of the map. Upon reaching the end of the map, you're promptly eaten by an Alaskan Bullworm. No idea why, but that signals your victory. However, a lone enemy stands in the way, ready to commence fencing at any given moment. This is where the real fun in the game lies, the fighting. Well, that's basically what the game is, so there's a plus.There are three stances that one can take whilst wielding a sword in Nidhogg: Low, mid, and high. If your opponent attacks you low, and your stance is low, then you block their attack. This applies to the other two stances as well. There's also a stance that you can take if you just hold your sword up high. This stance is only used to prepare for throwing the sword, which, when thrown, can be deflected if your opponent has a mid or high stance active. Once you're without a sword, you must revert to your fists, which don't always help out much. However, you can pick up a fallen sword.The game has a very minimalistic style to it. The characters are very low-res, solid-color sprites. This is an interesting style for such a game and it does add to the fun a bit on a certain stage, the Cloud stage. Because of the game's style, it is very difficult to see where each character is on this map, which is both a good and bad thing! All that said, the game does have one massive flaw. That flaw being the complete lack of content. For a game that has been in development for several years, I would at least expect more than four maps. Four years and only four maps? Very disappointing.Nidhogg, overall, is just an excellent game. Highly recommended if you have a friend to play it with!

												I'm definitely recommending that you play Nidhogg. The controls and mechanics are simple enough for you to learn them quickly, but they also have enough depth for complex, skill-based play. At first, fighting doesn't appear complicated, but there is a lot going on. Positioning is crucial; standing above your opponent or blocking a doorway can make all the diffence. You also have a few different ways to approach fighting. Fencing is an option, but you could also try tossing your sword and rushing ahead for some melee attacks. One of my favorite tricks is ""playing chicken""; I throw my sword and charge ahead, and right before my opponent attacks, I roll past them and just keep on going. Local versus is one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I've had in a long time. The visuals ooze retro style, and I absolutely adore the soundtrack.As much as I love the gameplay, I can't necessarily recommend that you buy Nidhogg, at least for $15. You don't get a ton of content for your money. Apart from multiplayer, all you get is a single-player mode that is just a series of AI matches. The AI makes it clear that Nidhogg is a multiplayer game at heart, as it lacks the complexity of a human player. Playing with friends is great because of the atmosphere, the intensity, and the psychology. Messing with your opponent's head is just as important as the onscreen action, and when playing against the AI, you lose that crucial component.If Nidhogg were around $7.50, I would have no reservations about recommending it. I'm still setting my review to ""recommended"" because the game itself is so fun, but you might want to wait for a sale.			"

												Addicting/10 Great fun to play with your friends. The combat feels super fast paced and fluid. Ignoring the gimmicky meta, the combat system itself is amazingly fun and simple to learn, hard to master. A great timekiller you can spend just a few minutes with while you're board or you can sit down and play this with a friend for an hour.			"

												Before now, games that duplicate the twitchy tactical joy of fencing have been nonexistant. They still stubbornly refuse to exist, but Nidhogg does a fantastic job of hinting at the complexity while totally failing to be a realistic fencing game. Lunging, disarming, punching, sweeping the leg, divekicking, and throwing the damn sword at your opponent are the only options you have but they make for a deep and textured fight. There is always a different technique to master and there are players out there that will take the fight in directions you never suspected in single player. The pace is fast but the response is so tight you never feel out of control. I love fighting protracted battles back and forth over a stage and then realizing the level is soaked in your and your opponent's blood. I love blitter feedback, the whole game looks like an Amiga demo.			"

												Amazing game.  It thrives on simple gameplay, and has some of the most crisp mechanics I've ever seen in an action-platformer.  This allows for a competitive experience purely based on skill; whether you win or lose, you feel as if you've earned the result.  The ""advancing-room-gameplay"" and evident verticality allows for on-your-heals strategizing, tense standoffs, and miraculous comebacks.  Keep in mind that this game is really meant for multiplayer.  Its mechanics are specific to the human element, and are best seen in player versus player combat.  This game is best played with a friend on local co-op, and should really only be bought for that purpose.  Online multiplayer is good, but does not contain the same enjoyment as facing down your oppenent eye-to-eye.  Online mode can lag as well, which can be frustrating in such a skill-based game.  Single player is nothing special, and should be seen as something to do when you don't have someone to play with.  It has a very arcadey feel and relatively challenging, but is not a time consumer, and furthermore, not is fun or rewarding when playing against another human.If you have a friend that is willing to play with you, you have to buy this game.  It is one of the greatest player versus player experiences on the PC.  If you are looking for a single player experience, you might want to stay away, as that is not what this game is meant for.  Although the base price of $15 ($12 now for sale) seems expensive for a low-budget indie game with only one game mode, it is suprisingly worth it.  You will have more fun playing this with a friend than in any other game I can think of.			"

												I love co-op games.  The problem is most of my immediate friends aren't ""hard core"" gamers and want something simple.  That explains why we play console FPS games alot together.  This game changes EVERYTHING.  The controls are simple to use yet very difficult to master.  I will hopefully be playing many hours of this with my friends.  I might go as far as to say it's one of the best co-op games of all time.  Nidhgg has Local (LAN), ""couch co-op"", and online (currently quite wonky) modes.

												Nidhogg (NEED-hawg) is ""a serpent in Niflheim who gnaws upon the lowermost root of Yggdrasil"" according to dictionary.com, but according to me it is an AMAZING game, worth every penny spent on it. The game is centered around a style of swordfighting similar to fencing, with a few twists. The soundtrack and art design are amazing, and the multiplayer, when it works, is very enjoyable.			"

												I think Nidhogg is an extremely fun game. It's combat is suprisingly deep for what it is and plays out gracefully against friends or against AI. The stages are also well designed and beautiful without a hypnotic soundtrack. However, despite being a pixel art game, Nidhogg is about as demanding as full HD 2D games such as Battleblock Theater. This wouldn't really be that big of issue, except for the fact that the game's logic is written in reference to frames instead of milliseconds meaning that if the framerate goes below 60 then the game will actually slow down which can be quite jarring. On the whole though, Nidhogg is a simple fighting game great for playing multiplayer or single player and I would reccomend it to anyone as soon as it goes on sale. That being said, if you have a lower-end PC be aware of the above issues.			"

												As of 1/26/14:I can't recommend this game, especially at 15 bucks at this moment for the following:-Limited maps: only 4 maps currently. Which one (Clouds) contains very strong strobing colors that sometimes make it hard to see if your enemy is armed or sometimes where you or your enemy is. This is not helped by sections of the map having a bridge that decays in less then 3 seconds when you stand on it, (which no other map currently has).-Busted online: some weird errors with inputs will occur where they don't read and net code will have you repeatedly teleport around, sometimes to your repeated death. Or it will TAKE BACK A KILL on your screen, for an example of a similar occurance look up ""GGPO rollback"".-Weird Frame bugs: currently people who can play some of the the highest ends games at a solid 60fps can barely get this to run at 30. I was able to play it at a smooth frame rate in the high 50s to a solid 60 yesterday and earlier today couldn't make it past 15 fps-Limited single player: a simple gaunlet mode that really only factors in time. Also a tutorial and that's it.-No visual customization options: in single and mutliplayer modes you see a range of colors if you have more then 2 players, but you can not select them! if you or another player are not assigned the color, you can't be that color.-No way to mod it at this moment: Can't make maps, modify existing maps, add weapons or anything. I'd think personally that a two person team of creative people would open it up to the public.There are some great variant options for multiplayer:- Boomerang sword, which is a fun way to tag the other player who might have rolled behind you- Spine sword: Kill a person with your barehands and you'll get a sword.- Low Gravity: If you like high jumps and/or more controls on your jumps.- Turbo mode: for those who think the game is a bit too slow, this cranks it up to what it would be like to have Quicksliver fight the Flash.-Ability to turn off throwing/swords: Make it harder for your enemy to fall back on old favorites. The latter is great if you mix it with spine swords.I felt like 15 bucks was too much simply because, I've gotten better games from steam or other online services from indie devs or smaller devs, then the activisions of the world, brand new for around the same price. Not only were they filled with more content for a person who wishes to play single player only. They had better online as well. I didn't expect that much from Nidhogg, but I expected more than I got especially with how busted the online is at points(I couldn't seem to do the basic function of throwing my sword, and before you say anything the other guys threw theirs). Which yes, while it's a 2 person team, it was a project that took them what? 4 years from concept to retail?Up to you if you want to spend the money, but I wouldnt recommend it.			"

												Overall, it's a fantastic little Local-Mutliplayer game to play with some good friends. With low system requirements, you can bring it to a friend's house on older laptop for portable fun. However, $15USD is pretty steep for the amount of content in the game, but it's a steal at around $5USD on sale (what I paid for it). Pros: - Hours of fun with friends.- Low system requirements. The pixel art style gets the job done.- 10+ gameplay settings to mix-and-match to create interesting matches.Cons: - Price. - Only 4 maps, but would be more acceptible if the price was lower (around $5USD).- I needed to use JoyToKey for my older controllers, despite it claiming to support DirectInput.- The Pause key (Esc) can't be rebound in the game.

While the single player is entertaining since the AI emulates a variety of playstyles, the real core of this game is multiplayer against your friends.  The visuals and mechanics are incredibly simplistic but are executed so well that every sucessful stab feels like a major victory.  No feeling is greater than facing your friend on the final screen and killing him as you shout ""AHA!"" and running to the next screen to begin the tug of war all over again.			"

												THE NIDHOGG MUST FEED. A SNACKRIFICE AWAITS.The question is, will it be you, or the other guy?Nidhogg is ostensibly a fencing game. But this appraisal is kind of misleading; it's definitely a game that features fencing, and the fencing is both simple and intense in the way many early-era 2 player games were (like Swashbuckler and Championship Karate). But there are a number of things going on here that you wouldn't see anybody getting away with in a proper fencing match, and that's where things start getting interesting. Throwing swords, sweeping the leg, and jump kicking the other dude in the chest are among the other tricks the Yellow Swoardsman and Orange Swordsman have at their disposal.But wait; the match isn't won when your enemy's body is at your feet. Victory is only achieved by reaching the end of the level, far past your nemesis' starting position. And you'll find several more of him waiting where the first one came from.So it's like fencing, even when it contains things other than fencing. Nidhogg is a must-play for anyone with a friend to play with, or hell, train your cat extremely well and play it with him.			"

												Cool little fast-playing sword-fighting game.  Reminds me of 80's arcade games, but the multiplayer (two play simultaneous or Online) really makes it.  Pull off amazing sequences like a pro one moment, snatching the opponent's sword, diving behind them, picking it up, stabbing them.  Then next time, somersault across the floor into the blade by accident.Great fun and well worth a few quid.			"

												This game is fantastic.  Don't let its simplistic graphics fool you, this is a superbly designed fighting game.  In place of complicated special moves and a constrained time limit you have very simple controls and mechanics that are combined in absolutely fascinating ways.  The key to the game is very much getting into your opponent's mind and anticipating their moves.  It's cheap, quick, and best of all fun for hours.			"

												8/10Nidhogg is one of the best local multiplayer games ever made.With two buttons and a directional stick Nidhogg manages more depth than you would imagine, anyone can pick it up and within minutes be screaming and shouting in excitement. Nidhoggs Presentation is simple but charming; looking like a mix of pixel art and papercraft, with high-tempo electronic music fitting very nicely with the action. Its a neat little package of elements that work just perfectly, but because of the simplicity of the game $15 feels like too high of an asking price and has probably scared off many steam customers.

												Nidhogg is a side-scrolling, “holy♥♥♥♥♥♥what-the-hell-is-going-on,” mixed with “I-don’t-know-why-I-can’t-stop-laughing.” It is played in a tug-of-war style fashion where the objective is to reach the end of the stage before your opponent reaches theirs by playing a friendly game of…fencing? The mechanics are simple to learn and run with, but definitely take at least moderate skill to master. From fencing, to CQC, you’ll find that there’s quite a few ways to maim your foes and book it to the end stage (have you stuck someone on your sword and moved it around yet? Brutal!). A game like this could be daunting had it been slow – the speed and fluid motions of the gameplay really shine in this high speed fencing brawl. A game like this reminds me of a single-player buy that you kill about an hour or two on and then never touch it again (unless you achievement hunt). The multiplayer adds so much more to the game, including at least several more hours you can kill in multiplayer. I’m not sure I’m 100% sold on a $15 dollar tag for the game. Granted it IS fun, and there IS a chance that I could play this for longer than I’m advertising, but I honestly can see this game sitting idly by once the novelty wears off. The part that sucks is close range strafing with your opponent. Too soft and you don’t do what you were hoping to do. Too hard and you just ran yourself right onto your opponents sword.Beautiful pixel graphics, interesting mechanics, and a unique game overall with brilliant music, I definitely recommend this game to those interested in taking a chance on something fresh and original. If you're worried about the price, catch it on sale. Between $4.99-7.99 is a must buy, $7.99-9.99 is what I would have expected.			"

												One of the most entertaining fighting games and IT'S NOT EVEN A FIGHTING GAME! It does however have everything you'd find in a typical 2D tournament fighter: mind games between players, footsies, yomi, cross-ups, ect. This game is best enjoyed between 2 people so spending the money for the double pace is well worth the extra coin. The icing on the cake is that it only takes about 7 seconds to download and 1 or 2 minutes to install minor updates! Seriously, this could have existed 30 years ago on the Atari 2600 (Okay, maybe not, but if you see the style of the graphics then you'll understand why). If your either casual player,  an indie fan, or fighting game veterian straight out of the arcades, than Nidhogg is the game for you.			"

												8/10Thanks Gaben for making the summer sale and I managed to buy this game on discount at an EXTREMELY low price ($2.99). This game is generally fun and you can play with your friends in a party, or whatever. I would recommend you to use a controller and play it on bigscreen as it is generally more fun and easier to control.The goal of this game, is to reach the goal sides set on teh side of both sides. You can repeatedly kill each other, until one reaches the end. (And you get a dragon to eat you for winning)There is a range of levels where you can entertain yourself and your friends with and have a good laugh. If you don't have friends or if they are too busy doing something else, you can play against the bot (singleplayer). The bot was also decent to play against. It wasn't too hard and it wasn't too easy. The online mode is messed up.Each map was fun to play with unique features. For example the map Mine, had transportation belts which either brings the player forward to allow him to reach the goal side quicker or push him/her back and make the progress slower. And the map Wild, had tall grass for the players to hide in. The graphics is good for a game like this. I'd prefer it to be pixelated and it gives it an arcade feel. The truth is, it doesn't need detailed graphics. For player movement, it was great. You can stab your opponent, throw swords, roll underneath players, disarm players from their swords and if you got disarmed yourself, you can punch the other player to death. If you fell down a pit and managed to grab a wall, keep on wall-kicking and get yourself out.And lastly, it gives a player tutorial which helps you learn about the controls, how to stab, throw, disarm, etc. Overall, this game is great and if you want a good laugh and have an enjoyable time by yourself or with your frieds, I'd definitely get it as it is on discount. Get 1 copy for your friends too!			"

												Nidhogg is trash.I'm not gonna leave it at that. Nidhogg is trash for a couple of reasons, and the developers just dont deserve your money. In terms of core gameplay, Nidhogg is great fun. You run around with one of your pals, you stab em, you roll under em, you jump into their sword a couple of times, but that's basically where it ends. This game is broken and limited in a lot of ways. Underwhelmingly short maps, only four maps in the first place, couple with a frustrating and bugged lobby system and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unecessary connection issues. You can only ever play this game online 50% of the time you try to play it online (speaking from experience). Sure, the ""story"" mode serves as a fun and challenging hour of gameplay, but after the first playthough, you have no real reason to replay it.Don't buy this game. "

												dont buy this game. its not worth 15 dollars. 10, maybe, but probably more like 5. The controls are screwed up to the point were its incredibly hard to control your guy. The mechanics allow your enemy to stab you from the exact same distance you TRIED to stab him. In fact, overall the mechanic where you NEED to be doing a specific action (in this case, sprint and duck/up) to either throw your sword, or do a leg sweep, is stupid, and only has a chance to work. I have died so many times as I have attempted to perform a sword throw, and rather have just raised my sword stupidly. additionally, the game system itself is flawed. Nidhogg uses a system called right of way to determin the winner. This means that when someone kills the other, they can just continuosly run to the endzone of the level, winning. Only one person can have right of way, but the person without spawns in front of the person with right of way whenever they die. First of all, this system is broken, as whoever has right of way can just jump over the enemy whenever they spawn. The spawning itself is flawed too, as you will find yourself having to kill someone three times just to move five feet, because they respawn the second after you kill them. These game mechanics arent broken, they just make the game frustrating rather than fun. Overall, this game is like a math test, it tests for skill, certainly, but its never fun, ever.			"

												A very fast paced, two player game (there is an AI, too, which comes in many and partly demanding difficulty, but you want to play this with another real player)The game is innovative, easy to understand, easy to learn and hard to master. It is very fun to play with friends, though it might destroy your friendship ;)One round lasts only a few minutes, except the players are on an very even level and no one is able to outplay his opponent. In that case, a game can last longer.There is also a multiplayer for random enemies, a tournament mode and some more, just discover it.I definetly recommend this game for a quick run in between.There is only one issue I need to critize:The game sometimes has to fight wich huge delays between clients, where you kill your opponent and suddenly fall down dead to ground and your opponent is alive again, because he killed you faster. But you can get over it, because the game is so quick, that the revenge is not far away.			"

												Before now, games that duplicate the twitchy tactical joy of fencing have been nonexistant. They still stubbornly refuse to exist, but Nidhogg does a fantastic job of hinting at the complexity while totally failing to be a realistic fencing game. Lunging, disarming, punching, sweeping the leg, divekicking, and throwing the damn sword at your opponent are the only options you have but they make for a deep and textured fight. There is always a different technique to master and there are players out there that will take the fight in directions you never suspected in single player. The pace is fast but the response is so tight you never feel out of control. I love fighting protracted battles back and forth over a stage and then realizing the level is soaked in your and your opponent's blood. I love blitter feedback, the whole game looks like an Amiga demo.			"

												Given, it's expensive, but this is couch grade gaming for PC. A laptop, an HDMI cable, and a wireless keyboard turned a couch into a battlefield and a sleepover into a blood feud. I can't think of a different game that gets the room screaming at eachother so quickly. Very fast, very frantic, insanely fun.			"

												8/10Nidhogg is one of the best local multiplayer games ever made.With two buttons and a directional stick Nidhogg manages more depth than you would imagine, anyone can pick it up and within minutes be screaming and shouting in excitement. Nidhoggs Presentation is simple but charming; looking like a mix of pixel art and papercraft, with high-tempo electronic music fitting very nicely with the action. Its a neat little package of elements that work just perfectly, but because of the simplicity of the game $15 feels like too high of an asking price and has probably scared off many steam customers.

												Easy to learn, tricky to master.  The game is indeed simple but is loaded with tech you will soon discover and sooner use as you try to outwit your opponent in a lightning paced rock paper scissors duel.  You'll get your fill in a few matches alone, but plug in another controller with a friend and you will shake the walls with competitive laughter. A must have for couch coop but i'd wait for it to be cheaper if you are forever alone.  And as always..Get the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Get the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Get the♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Here we see an elegant example of violence that can stretch and escalate seconds into eons, via time dialation, when one is caught in the vibrant throes of combat. Then it all comes down in a brilliant display of finesse. The spray of blood rises to the roar of the crowd. You are running, sprinting, sliding, and flipping over the reincarnations of your frustrated rival. And then it happens, you hit the endzone, where you are awarded the glorious peace of death.  This game plays like ping-pong, sometimes you are as if a marvelous and athletic warrior-god; then sometimes that poorly-timed jumpkick nets you a fence to the bowels and you fall into a deep pit like a bag of wet chicken fat.

												This is one of those couch co-op games where you test endurance more than skill.The game is a ""tug-of-war"" fencing game. What that means is, you can only progress if you were the last one to net the kill, and the entire goal isn't to kill the foe after that- it's to sprint to your goal. So long as you have the ""Go"" arrow you can progress, otherwise your opponent can. The goal of the game is to protect yourself while you're progressing and to be as aggressive as possible when you're defending.The game has very simple mechanics- Jump, lunge/throw, raise sword, lower sword, duck, roll, kick, flying kick, etc. What makes the game interesting is these simple mechanics blend so nicely... however it does lead to some intense frustration as you THINK you got the hit but your opponent was just ONE TINY MILLISECOND ahead of you and stabs you first.It's definitally a fun game that you can pick up with  a friend, but extended play is nerve-wrecking and requires a great deal of patience.

												Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends.In Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. Maneuvers such as, rolling, dive-kicking, neck-snapping and sword-throwing are also at your disposal. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row.After you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, if you get killed, he can run to the opposite direction, this will get you back to the previous screen, and this gets really annoying because sometimes the enemy instead of fighting you, will just run past you just to get you back to the previous screen. Each ‘level’ is divided into couple smaller ones. In single player, there is a total of 17 AI opponents, the first one being the easiest and the last one, the toughest(I don’t know if that’s true but when I’ve played it, the game got harder every time with each AI opponent). At the end of each level your character is eaten by a giant dragon-like creature, by the name of Nidhogg, you can’t avoid it though(trust me, I’ve tried), I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.The art style is what I love the most about this game, it has that surreal look to it, kind of like Hotline Miami. The player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone.On the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches. You can’t even properly communicate with your opponent because the chat can’t handle longer messages.As I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates.Nonetheless, If you enjoy playing games with your friends then this game is for you but If you don’t like the local multiplayer I would still recommend sure the game isn’t very long, but the multiplayer is still there, it might be a bit lackluster but who knows maybe the devs will add some new features to the online multiplayer.

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/nidhogg-game-review/Nidhogg, also referred to as Fencing Simulator 2014 (by me, at least), is an excellent example of what a casual, multiplayer indie game should be. Be prepared to engage in very fast-paced swordplay, with friends of course.The objective in Nidhogg is very simple: reach the end of the map on the enemy's side before he/she can reach your end of the map. Upon reaching the end of the map, you're promptly eaten by an Alaskan Bullworm. No idea why, but that signals your victory. However, a lone enemy stands in the way, ready to commence fencing at any given moment. This is where the real fun in the game lies, the fighting. Well, that's basically what the game is, so there's a plus.There are three stances that one can take whilst wielding a sword in Nidhogg: Low, mid, and high. If your opponent attacks you low, and your stance is low, then you block their attack. This applies to the other two stances as well. There's also a stance that you can take if you just hold your sword up high. This stance is only used to prepare for throwing the sword, which, when thrown, can be deflected if your opponent has a mid or high stance active. Once you're without a sword, you must revert to your fists, which don't always help out much. However, you can pick up a fallen sword.The game has a very minimalistic style to it. The characters are very low-res, solid-color sprites. This is an interesting style for such a game and it does add to the fun a bit on a certain stage, the Cloud stage. Because of the game's style, it is very difficult to see where each character is on this map, which is both a good and bad thing! All that said, the game does have one massive flaw. That flaw being the complete lack of content. For a game that has been in development for several years, I would at least expect more than four maps. Four years and only four maps? Very disappointing.Nidhogg, overall, is just an excellent game. Highly recommended if you have a friend to play it with!

												Nidhogg is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. It's complex and simple all at the same time. Once you've killed your opponent, they will respawn again in a couple seconds, and the goal is to proceed to the next screen until you reach the end of the level. After reaching the end of the level, you will defeat your opponent and move on to the next where you will fight a differently colored progressively more skilled opponent. I believe the price is a bit high simply because more people would get to enjoy the game if it were cheaper, but it is infact worth the full 15$ price tag.			"

Simple painting style and easy operation is the biggest characteristic of this game. It's a nice option for u if u wants to play this game on coach to relax urself and have some fun. There are four maps in this game and they are all excellent. The BGM in the cloud is awesome! But the color of the background in clouds always makes my eyes feel dizzy. Hope the producer will update more different scenes for the players to play. Unicorn worm is my favorite thing in this game, coz that means VICTORY.(Hit: It’s more fun with friends. If u don’t have friends play this game with u, do not buy it. Coz u will be so boring by your own!)So, if u has lots of friends, and u likes to spend ur time on the sofa, this game is totally worth for u. Btw: wait until a sale to buy it. The price is way too much. ;)			"

												A very fast paced, two player game (there is an AI, too, which comes in many and partly demanding difficulty, but you want to play this with another real player)The game is innovative, easy to understand, easy to learn and hard to master. It is very fun to play with friends, though it might destroy your friendship ;)One round lasts only a few minutes, except the players are on an very even level and no one is able to outplay his opponent. In that case, a game can last longer.There is also a multiplayer for random enemies, a tournament mode and some more, just discover it.I definetly recommend this game for a quick run in between.There is only one issue I need to critize:The game sometimes has to fight wich huge delays between clients, where you kill your opponent and suddenly fall down dead to ground and your opponent is alive again, because he killed you faster. But you can get over it, because the game is so quick, that the revenge is not far away.			"

												This game is one of those games that gives you so much adrenaline you feel like your going to explode at any given moment.This ame is definatley worth its money and exceeds expectaions of alot of people.Thsi game is in its prime when your at the end of that 8 player tournement, you against your friend, ten pounds is on the line and your on that final screen running straight for the crowd and then.... uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... you sab is eye and blood leaks every where and his head is hanging on the end of your sword.You run straight for that exit when...BAM hes right in front of you and stabs you and it takes another 5 minuites to get back there but this time your ready for it and you ninja jump over him and stab him in the stomach and win the tournement.So buy that game now.

												Disregard all the posts about shotty internet. Sure, the matchmaking system is pretty poor, but if you buy the game with a friend that lives nearby, the connection is alomost seemless. My friend and I bought it two days ago, and have been playing for quite some time now. The game is a fast paced yet grueling tug of war. Every duel is tense, and there are a variety of different combat options to murder your foe with.Overall, I am having a hard time remembering a time were I felt so intensely immersed in a 2D indie game.Final verdict: A must buy if you plan to play it with friend(s) that live nearby.

												The gameplay makes this game worth every penny. If you like fighting games and you have some friends who like fighting games, it's a great purchase. Better if they're local, until they fix the netcode. But it's great anyway! To be honest, there's not too much content. Single player is a simple series of fights across the 4 available stages. There's only one type of character. But if you like snappy, fluid gameplay with great tactical depth, you'll find that there's a lot to learn and love with Nidhogg.Also I love the soundtrack and how it reacts to the match. When there's a lull, it slows down and the drums fade away, only to start back up again at a player's untimely demise. Find me online (and hopefully the netcode gets fixed soon!).			"

												Nidhogg is a great game where two players engage in a fencing duel of throwing, kicking, and stabing. This game can easy for two players to play on one computer (for instance one player using w,a,s,d and another up, down, left, right). You can set up tournaments where players can battle in a series of battles determining the best player. Nidhogg includes has a single-player mode. In singleplayer you fight different computers in hope of getting the fastest time. One great feature is variants where you can customize the gameplay for a new experience. Variants include time limit, low gravity, turbo mode, slow mode, boomerang swords, and more. I would highly recomend this game for any group of two or more people.			"

												I give this game a 9/10. It is very fun, the mechanics are smooth, the gameplay is unique, and it is so fast paced. The problems i have are that the enemies in single player are sometimes superhumanly good. I know you can't make perfect AI but this is sometimes frustrating. Do you like to get hit in the face with swords? Well you are going to get used to it. The other problem i have is the cloud level. Sometimes the swords are too hard to see because they match the background. Matchmaking is wierd as I am usually sitting there and no matches are being made. Maybe just no one is on? I definately recomed this game.			"

Every level has a harder AI with diferent ways of fighting and beating all is a fun challenge but the real fun is the multiplayer. If you have a sibling, friend or partner with who you love playing games with then i recommend you consider buying this game (like, for real).			"

												First and foremost: Get a friend to play with you on the same TV. Trust me. Get a few friends, a small party. This game is at its best when you have a crew of folks with you playing tournaments.It's a very simple game that's damn near impossible to master, and every single match with a human opponent can offer more range of emotion than your average title simply from your own progress -- or loss of.If you're only interested in single player, this game will SEVERELY disappoint at just four maps and very few modes. However, these maps are finely tuned and feature everything you'd need for a game like this, and the modes are just interesting enough to throw a curveball to your opponent. So go in with the thought that you're going to find someone to play with. Trust me.			"

												I first played Nidhogg after dinner at a friend's house. Things were looking boring so I whipped out my laptop that everyone could gather round to watch me play Freecell.Luckily, someone grabbed it from me and logged onto their Steam account to set up a tournament of this game.You each control a fencer and have to kill the other guy then run across their body to get to the next screen. Do this enough times and you win.You can throw your sword at your opponent's face, disarm them, and even roll like a ninja/bowling ball along the floor before sweeping out their legs and pulling the still-beating heart out of their body.It's great.And it has graphics like on an old-timey computer, but really slick animation, so the whole style is warm and milky all over your face. Haha! But seriously, the animation is great. I heard the guy spent four years on it. Or the game as a whole. I dunno. But it was four years well spent whatever.Oh, and what's the Nidhogg? You'll find out. Just whatever you do - and I can't stress this enough - don't get eaten by it!			"

There's only one type of character. But if you like snappy, fluid gameplay with great tactical depth, you'll find that there's a lot to learn and love with Nidhogg.Also I love the soundtrack and how it reacts to the match. When there's a lull, it slows down and the drums fade away, only to start back up again at a player's untimely demise. Find me online (and hopefully the netcode gets fixed soon!).			"

												I give this game a 9/10. It is very fun, the mechanics are smooth, the gameplay is unique, and it is so fast paced. The problems i have are that the enemies in single player are sometimes superhumanly good. I know you can't make perfect AI but this is sometimes frustrating. Do you like to get hit in the face with swords? Well you are going to get used to it. The other problem i have is the cloud level. Sometimes the swords are too hard to see because they match the background. Matchmaking is wierd as I am usually sitting there and no matches are being made. Maybe just no one is on? I definately recomed this game.			"

												I first played Nidhogg after dinner at a friend's house. Things were looking boring so I whipped out my laptop that everyone could gather round to watch me play Freecell.Luckily, someone grabbed it from me and logged onto their Steam account to set up a tournament of this game.You each control a fencer and have to kill the other guy then run across their body to get to the next screen. Do this enough times and you win.You can throw your sword at your opponent's face, disarm them, and even roll like a ninja/bowling ball along the floor before sweeping out their legs and pulling the still-beating heart out of their body.It's great.And it has graphics like on an old-timey computer, but really slick animation, so the whole style is warm and milky all over your face. Haha! But seriously, the animation is great. I heard the guy spent four years on it. Or the game as a whole. I dunno. But it was four years well spent whatever.Oh, and what's the Nidhogg? You'll find out. Just whatever you do - and I can't stress this enough - don't get eaten by it!			"

As well as the price being lowered a tad bit. Because there's nothing else but 4 small levels to play through by yourself, or up against your friends.No story, nothing but an arcade-like ladder solo expereince and multiplayer. So, 15 bucks? A little too much-Otherwise, it's a really fun experience.			"

 A Nidhogg is a mythical creature in Norse mythology which is a giant, man-eating serpent. In this game two fencers battle it out for the glory of being eaten by the Nidhogg in the ultimate sacrifice to the gods, or something like that. GAMEPLAY I have to admit when i first started playing I had no idea what the heck was going on. Bashing random keys hoping something would happen, but the AI continued to outsmart me; Keyboard is not recommended. When I used my controller (steam controller works great! xbox too) the controls seemed much easier to get the hang of but it is still complex enough to keep me interested. You can choose a high, centered or lower stance to stab your opponent.Just aim above or below your opponent  right?  wrong.Besides stances there are a ton of strategies for you to employ: running, rolling, jumping, jump kicking, sword throwing.If you're feeling really daring there's even a way to disarm your opponent, but beware you can still get knocked out and strangled to death (seriously) and lose the arrow.The arrow is something that's been there in loads of games, but it works pretty well in this game. At the start there is no arrow until one of the fencers kills the other. Then the power of the arrow is all yours and you don't have to actually kill your opponent. Then run for your life! the Nidhogg awaits! SOUND Meh. The soundtrack is more or less what you'd expect, I like it :PThe sword swings and the death screams are what you're hearing most of the time, and they are fantastic. Not to the point where they are haunting, but they aren't silly either. And the sweet sound of the crowds after you have bested your opponent is one of the best feelings in this game. GRAPHICS Well lets be honest here, if you've already looked at the game its clear that graphics are not the main focus. You could probably redraw this game in MS Paint. But hey, its an art choice, right?The effect of the pixel art is kind of nice and makes the game feel a bit unique (to me at least, if you play a lot of pixel art games then maybe not) and as you spill your opponent's blood, or they yours, you notice the area becoming absolutely soaked in blood, which is also the same colour as its respective carrier before it was splattered everywhere making it easy to see who the real lamb to the slaughter is. CONCLUSION It's a complete package, no DLC adds a few points in my book, death screams and for added fun, you can always roleplay as the fencer (en garde!) with a friend if that's your thing. Challenging single player modes, and multiplayer is double the fun. 7/10. Very replayable and keeps me coming back too.Get this game if you like stabbing people, annoying your friends, or if you want to play it with me because I love this game for all the right reasons.

												Nidhogg is a pretty fun 2D fencing fighting game the over the top fighting that goes into each match is a very fun concept, however I don't believe it's worth 15.00 considering even though there is online multiplayer, there's barely any stages, not enough gimmicks, once you're done with the single player and play a few matches online you'll probably end up playing something else. If they added more stages, more fighting techniques, and just a little more here or there it'd definitely be worth the price tag. I recommend getting this at a discount.			"

												Nidhogg is a very fun game with solid controls and gameplay mechanics. The graphics are also very colorful and looks like a classic Atari game. The singleplayer pitts you againsed multi-colored enemies who are suprizingly very smart with different stratagies. The only downside to this game is the multiplayer. Don't get me wrong the multiplayer is very fun and challenging, but at this current time there are not many people actually playing the game. When you do eventually find a game lag can be an issue for this fast-paced game. Overall it's a great experience and you should pick it up while it's still on sale!			"

												Nidhogg is a pretty fun 2D fencing fighting game the over the top fighting that goes into each match is a very fun concept, however I don't believe it's worth 15.00 considering even though there is online multiplayer, there's barely any stages, not enough gimmicks, once you're done with the single player and play a few matches online you'll probably end up playing something else. If they added more stages, more fighting techniques, and just a little more here or there it'd definitely be worth the price tag. I recommend getting this at a discount.			"

This makes the game unplayable since both players start playing a diferent game but theyre movements are still shown resulting in both players running in the opposite direction until one player wins and the other player's game crashes.

												This is an amazingly addictive and fun platforming game. It mixes swordplay and smooth platforming to make an awesome game. The fact that it supports local and global multiplayer only adds to the ridiculousness you can have. The a.i is a bit derpy at first but their intelligence increases as you progress further through the storyline. The areas which you explore are all interesting and keep you on your toes with the natural hazards. Even the most boring one, The Castle, was very fun to run about in.			"

												Atari-tier murder fencing, I approve!  In addition, the focus on positioning as a means to fulfill your victory condition is an interesting choice for a game's standard mode of play.  While this is a game containing combat, it is moreso a game of competitive movement management.  While it has some problems, mostly collision properties on the win screen, none of them seem to interfere with the core gameplay.  I am of the opinion that Nidhogg is a simple but elegantly designed piece.			"

												It took me a while to understand this game. It seemed clunky, weird, too based on random chance and the luck of finding an opening as I charged blindly forward. I didn't get what I was doing wrong. Then, on my third run through the wilds level, my opponent and I both disarmed one another simultaneously. I didn't have a weapon, and neither did he. So I did what seemed sane: I tried to stab him anyways. And we started boxing. Then he punched me backwards into the crop fields, where I had seen my weapon land. Frantically, I searched the stalks of wheat, looking for the familiar silver glint of my weapon. Behind me, he leapt into the air, ready to land upon me where I lay and smash my face into the dirt that would be my unceremonius grave. And at the last possible moment, my hand met the cold steel of my blade, and I spun, holding my weapon high —He landed squarely on the tip of sword, violently impaled by his own momentum. And in that moment, I understood. This game was exactly as frantic, exactly as crazy and snap-reflex-based as a real fencing match, between real swordsmen. The controls might not have the finesse of an actual human arm holding an epee, but the mechanics, the pacing; these are pitch-perfect, and evoke the same thrilling adrenaline rush that whipping an actual rapier around in a clumsy attempt at defense gave me in my teenage fencing lessons (my local community center offered some pretty rad summer programs). The key is to treat combat in Nidhogg with the same sort of gravity you would in real life. Take small, inching steps toward your enemy. Change stances freely, and attack opportunistically, when given a wide opening. And only throw your sword at the oppenent when it's the only move you've got left.It's possible to beat Nidhogg without really knowing how to play it. The game is pretty forgiving, and you have an unlimited number of attempts for each stage, meaning you can essentially grind your way towards victory if you're really determined. But it's immensely satisfying to clear a level without losing a life by trouncing the bevy of foes that stand in your way one-by-one. So practice up, and prove you've got what it takes to be a winner.			"

												Before you start playing this game, don't be confused, LOCAL multiplayer is really it's strong suit. Now I don't have many hours played on my account, but I've played this game plenty on a friend's, and it really is an excellent game. It's definitely a game of skill. No outside forces are going to impact whether or not you come out the victor, it's simply you against your opponent, and occasionally taking advantage of your surroundings. The swordplay is easy to get used to but hard to master, and when you snap the neck of an enemy that's on the ground, it's amazingly satisfying. The visuals are a retro style done right, and the music and sound effects make the game come alive. One of the best local multiplayer experiences I've ever had. However, connections with online multiplayer seem to be giving other people problems. (I don't have experience with this myself, as I've only played it locally) so if this is a turn-off for you, keep that in mind. If the local multiplayer experience is enough to warrant the $15 for you, go for it. If not, get the game on sale. One way or another, Don't pass up on this game.			"

You're getting a game that, at it's core, is simple, but provides copious amounts of fun. It's not an epic, open-world adventure. It's simply a side-scrolling game of tug-of-war with old-school inspiration and it delivers. I would recommend this game to anyone that considers it.			"

												A radical short and sweet game. 4 levels.  Amazing with friends online or in the same room. If you enjoy party style games get it. I think this game is suits people who are aware of what theyre getting, it's perfect and doesn't need to be more or less of what it is.			"

												It's not the most innovative, graphically appeasing, or even necessarily best game I've ever played. ...But dude, it is fun. Not like , ""Oh wow that was fun"" and never pick the game back up again, More along the lines of, ""I have had this much fun playing a video game with someone since Goldeneye 64."" fun. Literally, my only complaint about the game is not having more people around willing to play it with me.  10/10			"

I've enjoyed every second of it and can't wait to play with a few friends. My one gripe is the number of arenas, with there being only four at the time of release. Hopefully more will be added on.

												This game is really fun. I haven't played with it locally with friends yet, but i laugh and yell at the screen when playing it by myself, so i'm sure it will be a fantastic game to play with a bunch of friends at your house. The tournament mode will add a lot of fun to the local experience too. The only downfall to this game i see so far is the lack of an online community. I know it just came out on steam but whenever i search for an online match it says only 3 or 4 people are online. I find this disturbing since this game is fun as hell. Hopefully it will pick up.

												I have been following this project for literally years (2010?  MAYBE early 2011), and let me tell you, after all of the reviews, all of the updates, this game was completely worth the wait.It proves that a game can take utter simplicity (graphically, mechanically, premise) and create such great variety and nuance.  The designer even did an excellent job translating the chaotic balance of actual historical and olympic sword play!  I immediately bought the game for my buddy, because I can't wait to play this with friends.  Everytime you think you have the upperhand, you get a lesson in humility.  As one early reviewer stated, ""I've never had so much fun dying!""Enjoy! "

Grab it on sale, for sure.My gaming friends had been looking for a fighting game to turn to as our standard duke-it-out kinda game.  We'd tried SF4, Injustice, and MK9.  One guy picked Nidhogg up on PSN, and it's become the game we were searching for.  You don't need a huge cast of characters, you don't even need much in the way of graphics.  Just make the combat mechanics solid.			"

												Do not buy this game for online play. You will be disappointed.I love looking for new games to play with friends, and I was ecstatic to see this finally released. The gameplay is fantastically unique: You fight past your opponent to run to their 'endzone.' Killing them is not always necessary; you can just run past them, but it'll usually get you killed. After all, combat is what the game was made for.When fencing, there are three different stances you can take (low, mid, high), which can be used for parrying, or, if swift enough, disarming. But if you get disarmed, you can still roll under your opponent, kick them off their feet, snap their neck, and take their sword. But then they respawn at the other end again! So here's where you just chuck your sword into their head and pick it up again as you run past.This is one of very few games where I have wanted to practice different techniques, guards, and attacks. The depth of gameplay is great (Even if there are only four stages), and the idea is unique. The one downside is the online play, which, more often than not, gives players too much lag to even be playable.I wouldn't recommend this if you don't have friends to play with locally, but if you do, enjoy!

												Hey guys this is not worth it. I was very excited about it and the basic idea is great. However, the game was unplayable, for me at least. It didn't recognize my Logitech game pad so I had to use the keyboard which is not really meant to be used in the game. The secondary problem was that the online match making does not work AT ALL.Even IF everything would have worked, it is definitely not worth 13,99€.			"

												Between the parrying, disarming, dodging, rolling, wall-jumping, punching, sweep-kicking, throwing your sword in rage to kill a fleeing adversary, having the satisfaction of idly jiggling your sword into your impaled foe's innards, and ultimately coming down to fisticuffs until you tear out your opponent's heart (or, as so often happens, they tear YOUR heart out), this game allows the players and spectators alike to enjoy the chaos of swordfighting in a 2-D world in good ol' fashioned, nitty-gritty one-on-one PvP, done arcade style and done right. Highly recommended for a game to settle a beef, make wagers, record the inevitable rage of at least one of the combatants, or just to pass the time with a gruesome yet addicting game of pixelated tug-of-war (just replacing the ropes with rapiers). 9.5/10 (because there is just a tad bit of lag occasionally online, but that's partly my weak internet connection).

												There's something to be said about a game that feels as balanced as Nidhogg does. Every offense has its countering defensive stance, every defense has an offensive move to get around it, and none of them require any more or less effort than the other, making it a simple game of preparation, reflexes, and psychology; the true essence of a fighting game.The graphics could be described as 'minimal', or it could be described as 'clear'. I choose to view it the latter way. All necessary information is communicated in an understandable fashion without sacrificing artistic integrity. Daedelus' soundtrack provides an excellent support to the atmosphere of the game and its individual levels, from the intense and aggressive Wilds, to the tense and deliberate Mines, and the quick and nimble Clouds.Nidhogg's design is flawless in nearly every aspect, the only regrets being the lack of content. But why should you care about that, when you can throw a sword at someone to force them to block high, roll underneath them while grabbing a sword, then stab them in the back in a series of grand maneuvers that will make you feel like a god among men?

												It is super intense, involves lots of posturing, feinting, chasing, and stabbing. The AI seems to know what it's doing and can offer a consistent challenge (more time to improve may change that) and keep me on my toes. The matchmaking is kinda slow and has problems inviting those on your friends list. The multiplayer is a barrel of laughs and frantic swordfights. The tutorial is buggy and essentially incomplete as well.Kinda pricey for what it ultimately is, but but for the time being I find it worth it, Maybe hold out for a bundle or steam sale if you're on the fence. Definitely if you have someone you can regularly play it wth on the same keyboard.			"

												I strongly recommend this game. Even with the people complaining about lag in the forums, I played it with my friend and had no problems at all. And being a huge fencing fan, I think this game is perfect in the format it was made. You really need to approach the fight strategically or you'll get your derrière sistematically handed to you. The game is one hit kill when armed with sword and when disarmed if your opponent strikes you on the ground he'll snap your neck and kill you, but this is just a mean to an end, since your main goal ain't to kill your opponent but to get to the last screen you need to push to be devoured by the mythical serpent Nidhogg, hence the name of the game, and to do that you need to kill you enemy and  move forward through each screen, being lead to a fence-fueled tug of war. And the graphics, soundtrack and sound effects match the game perfectly and until now I didn't experienced any major flaws on the gameplay of the game which is fluid and easy to get the hang. The single-player can be fun enough, but the game really shines in the multiplayer, the local versus can make for a really neat party game. So scrap some cash and buy this gem.			"

												This game is a blast to play!  The singleplayer is fine, but the meat and potatoes of this game is when you're facing a human opponent either online or locally.  The online can use a bit of work because some matches can be pretty laggy.  However, when you do get in to a match and everything works, it really works.  Still, the netcode needs improvement and I hope the fixes for that come sooner rather than later.There's a lot of hidden depth to the gameplay as well.  You have to decide when it's right to let yourself die in order to respawn in front of your opponent before they make it to the next screen.  When is it the right time to make a break for it to get to the next screen?  When you decide to let yourself die in order to respawn as a barrier for your opponent, is there is even enough time for you to respawn in front of them?  Should I hold on to my sword, or should throw it and make a run for it hoping it distracts the opponent? These are some of the thoughts that will constantly be running through your head while playing this game and it's made all the more intense when facing off against a human opponent.I also really dig the old-school Atari 2600-esque look of the game.  The use of colours makes the levels look really nice and I just like the simplicity of it.  The super colourful neon blood is also prety great!The soundtrack to the game is also fantastic!  Each of the 4 levels in the game has a unique song that plays in the background and it makes the one on one battle so much more enjoyable.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a lot of local and online (when it's properly working 100% of the time) MP fun!			"

												This game is a  lot of fun for single player, but not for very long. i beat the single player in 1.7 hours. i haven't tried it with friends yet (mostly cuz im forever alone and none of my friends have it) but im sure it would be a lot better that way. i only payed $1 usd for this because i got it in a humble bundle but the game normally costs $15 usd and i DO NOT think it is worth nearly that much. i would say this game is worth about $3 usd because there is not much content in it.

												Wow, well that was short...I was under the impression this game would be a fun and frantic sword-em-up where I run through level upon level fighting similar sword wielding stick-men.Fun? Admittedly yes, and the combat system requires precision and timing. If you fail, it was your fault, but when you succeed, you know you earned it.Swords? Yea, there's a f*ck-ton. I gave it an extra point in the score just for this reasonLevel upon level? Here's where we nosedive... There are four... And they're not long. The 12 or 16 stages that make up the singleplayer shamelessly reuse the levels, making progress repetitive.I'd go on but I'm being given *the stare* for not ironing my shirt. So we'll leave it at this:With completion in just under 2hrs of total play time, and a default cost of £10.99! A worthwhile purchase this game is not. [4.0]			"

												A truly fun game with very smooth gameplay. There's not much singleplayer content other than fighting a line of swordmen with the difficulty increase per time you defeat the next in the row. The multiplayer seems to have a bit delay for now, other than that it's great fun killing your enemy. Your goal is to get to the right of the level and enter the next screen, while your enemy have to get to the left side of the screen. You are only able to move to the next scene when  you have the GO sign in the opposite corner of yourself, It's a tough process and can take a good amount of time if you're playing against a mighty fencer. There are various ways to kill and disarm your enemy or yourself :3You have 5 different ways to hold your sword, with different range depending on you're trying to target the enemies feet or head. The higher you aim, the longer range. The lower you aim, the shorter range. When holding the sword in the upper position, you'll be able to throw it (also when jumping in midair), hopefully killing your enemy or die trying... When you jump, you're able to strike downward, this is a great ability if you've lost your sword and still want to go offensive on your enemy. You can also roll and kick when approaching the player if his sword is in a high position, else you'll just die horribly by getting stacked in the chest or face. The sound effects makes it quite enjoyable to stick your sword through the chest of someone else and keeping it inside, making it ""bleed""  more and enemy scream even longer is just very satisfying.The different set of levels gives the player a good amount of space to use his different moves and feature lots of movement to make the scenes more alive, the game does have music but it's quite ambient and might not get noticed because of the  screams coming from either you or your enemy..:CONCLUSION:.It's really good fun and plays great, the price point might be a bit high but there's online multiplayer which makes the price acceptable in my opinion. There's not much content for the single-player type and the online multi-player can be slighty laggy at times but based on being very unique, play very smooth and the gameplay have great combat, I would very much recommend this game.

												While it is an enjoyable game with an original playstyle and tight as ♥♥♥♥ controls, I cannot recommend it. The single player is boring with only 4 maps and little variation between opponents, with only a single gamemode. Multiplayer was good fun but the developers managed to ♥♥♥♥ it up somehow in the new update so playing with friends is virtually impossible.Asking £10.99 for this small game is an insult as it only provided some brief entertainment before I became bored and tired of the concept. I understand that this was a kickstarter project so I would rate this game 9/11, because it is suspicous and requires futher investigation.It looks like the devs pocketed all the money and then released small uninspired updates which add no actual content but instead break a fun little game. It's horrendously overpriced and has broken multiplayer.			"

												Half a year on, and the developer doesn't seem to give a damn about supporting this lackluster game.The foundation of Nidhogg is solid. It's a fun little game, with a surprising amount of depth. But with only four levels, AI opponents that are easily circumvented, and an online multiplayer that is tricky to get to work... asking €13,99 for this is absolutely ludicrous. It's the kind of game that's A LOT of fun to play, for an hour. And then you're done with it. You leave it be, hoping that the developer will release some more content for it later on - free or paid. But no, nothing. Not even a tiny little patch with minor fixes.The game IS good, but the fun is extremely shortlived. ONLY BUY THIS GAME if you see it on sale, and only if it is heavily discounted. I'm talking a couple of Euros/Dollars here. THEN, it will be worth it. And only if you buy it with a friend, so you can play together.			"

												Nidhogg solely focus on a combat system, combining fencing and tug-of-war together to create a simple yet fun gameplay. There are a lot of options there to create a strategy. You can fight your opponent with rapier or goes unarmed, you can thrust, punch, parry, disarm opponent, throwing weapon, do a sweep attack, and even do a dive kick. Running away also a one good strategy here in Nidhogg for you to consider as the objective is to reach the goal not to defeat the opponent until he/she run out of life.Nidhogg's concept is good and the video that show is even help make it look very interesting.Anyway, one big flaw of Nighogg is a lacks of contents, especially in a lacks of solid single player content. The only thing you will find in a single player mode is a series of 16 AI opponents that not really different in terms of difficulty, pretty much the same. There are only 4 stages in the game as you can see in the video. No unloackable contents pretty much make this game suffer a scarceness of solid contents and no replay value.It is true that the core design of the game is quite interesting. I am able to enjoy a single player mode to some extent but that's that. Once I beat the single player mode I went to try multiplayer mode with someone, unfortunately online matchmaking show that no one playing Nidhogg online and none of my fried owned this game as well.I guess the game could deliver a better experience if you has a friend to play together offline or online but for a gamer who focus on single player experience I recommend you to avoid Nidhogg. Even with a 66% discount for this game is seem a little pricy to me after I bought it.			"

												This game is pure fun! It can't really be described, other than fast paced fencing-martial arts-divekicking-combat - oh yea, and you get eaten by a huge wyrm at the end of every level to top it all off. The combat system is unique, in that there is surprising depth for such a seemly short (and by short, I mean a ton of deaths every level. This game isn't exactly easy) single player game. Developing your own style really feels like you own it, and every time you die, you don't feel cheated. Multiplayer is where this game really shines, and it's really meant to be played against a human opponent, whether someone online or someone sitting beside you. The CPU opponents put up a great fight though, and it's perfect for developing your own style of play before you face off with a friend. The price is slightly high, for what this game is, but if you feel like it's something you might enjoy, I would say possibly wait for a sale if you are strapped for cash. That being said, I do not regret my purchase. To me personally, this game is worth it.			"

												Oooh, this is a clever little game we have here that essentially covers a 9 stage long map focusing on fencing and running for your life. Nidhogg is a tug-of-war game that relies on basic movement and attack mechanics (literally, there are 6 controls) to simulate fast-paced fencing and brawling combat in a race to be devoured by the beast called, ""Nidhogg"". While the end result of winning is less than appealing the gameplay itself is very clever, as players are constantly able to change their way of playing to adapt to their opponent's play style, and the cute graphical style while sometimes can be an eyesore (prime example being the pre-game chat, it's basically impossible to tell the letters apart.), it usually has this sort of retro charm that makes you want to wash the floors with your opponents blood once more. So, do I reccomend this game? Yes. Will I continue to play it for years to come? Yes.-WolfEpiphany			"

												One of the most satisfying fighting/1v1 games out right now. The low-fi graphics might be a turn off for some people, but it's an insanely accurate and tightly controlling game. Very well balanced and interesting to play for hours on end. The soundtrack by Daedelus is beautiful as well, and fits very well with the overall mood of the game.			"

												     The adrenaline will fly as you try to overtake your opponent in Nidhogg! The object of the game is to reach the other side of the map, to which there are seven sections; the only thing stopping you is your little set of legs and your adversary. There is a surprising amount of depth to this one on one side scroller, despite the only controls being jump, attack and the directions. You can hold your sword in three positions: high, medium, or low. Where you hold the sword dictates what attacks you will block.      All throughout you will have to make split-second decisions, and those decisions are what make the game so addicting. At times, you will be convinced that you have felled the enemy, only to be rolled into and killed. These are the defining moments of Nidhogg; while your jaw is on the floor from the surprise, your stinker of a roommate hoofs it to the goal.			"

												Nidhogg is one of the funniest games I've ever played, through just the multiplayer gamemode. I think the game could be improved if you had to win each room rather than being able to run forward at all times, but other than this, the multiplayer gamemodes are hilarious. Meddling with the different options lead to some hilarious matches, all fighting for the glory of being eaten by the almighty serpent Níðhöggr. Thoroughly reccommend this game as a local multiplayer game with friends, as it has provided hours of fun.			"

												This game is pure fun! It can't really be described, other than fast paced fencing-martial arts-divekicking-combat - oh yea, and you get eaten by a huge wyrm at the end of every level to top it all off. The combat system is unique, in that there is surprising depth for such a seemly short (and by short, I mean a ton of deaths every level. This game isn't exactly easy) single player game. Developing your own style really feels like you own it, and every time you die, you don't feel cheated. Multiplayer is where this game really shines, and it's really meant to be played against a human opponent, whether someone online or someone sitting beside you. The CPU opponents put up a great fight though, and it's perfect for developing your own style of play before you face off with a friend. The price is slightly high, for what this game is, but if you feel like it's something you might enjoy, I would say possibly wait for a sale if you are strapped for cash. That being said, I do not regret my purchase. To me personally, this game is worth it.			"

												Nidhogg is nice for the first few hours within which you'll probably repeatedly fight the singleplayer AI until you release it's occasionally either far too stupid or far too difficult (it can do things that you simply cannot), at which point you'll probably feel experienced enough to try the multiplayer.It's at this point that the game completely falls apart. The multiplayer is consistently laggy and it always seems to take at least a few minutes to get into a match - if finding a game wasn't arduous enough, attempting to transfer your SP tactics to MP is nigh impossible since you'll find the controls simply aren't responsive enough. Nidhogg absolutely requires you to have quick reactions and MP makes this impossible.The Tournament mode is useless without at least two other experienced players able to use your computer (since it's local MP) and if you were looking to practice against the AI then enjoy having to play through the entire game just to get to a point you feel is difficult enough because you can't skip levels.Oh, and the super bright cloud level is absolutely horrible to look at, I personally can barely see anything. I wonder how exactly the development time on this game was spent when there are such obvious flaws (why would you choose a bright background when the player is bright yellow and the sword is white?)I do honestly like the gameplay but I can't in all good conscience recommend this game to anyone looking for a competitive multiplayer experience. Some cool stuff can happen but on average, Nidhogg will leave you simultaneously annoyed but wanting to play more since it could get better.			"

												I learned about Nidhogg after I played a game based off of Nidhogg, back when Nidhogg wasn't even released yet. The game was called Eggnogg, and it was said to be the closest thing to what Nidhogg was probably going to be. At the time, people couldn't get enough of what they saw of Nidhogg, and they really couldn't wait for it to finally come out, so much so that they would start making games based of it.When Nidhogg was finally released, I had already forgotten about it, having had my fill of copies and games based off of the copies.I did remember this game again, eventually. I won it in a giveaway, and now here I am. The game fulfills a lot of promises, for me. And I jump and stab my way through the stages, listening to engaging music, shouting at my opponent in anger and glee. It's all around fun that I'm sure I'll get every time I load the game.Get Nidhogg, play it with your friends, stab someone in the face, and sacrifice yourself to the great dragon while having lots of fun. I know I am.10/10			"

												Part Super Smash Bros, part Divekick, part ""I'm-totally-gonna-cleave-your♥♥♥♥♥quot; Simulator 2016. Nidhogg was one of those unfortunate indie games, that went under the radar in my case until my good old friend RTRIX insisted he'd buy me this game as a gift. Reluctantly, I accepted his gift, and quickly got surprised of the game's competetive feel, smooth fighting mechanics and the sheer fun. However, do be mindful of the lag, stuttering and the input lag when joining an online game with your friend. That said, this game also has offline multiplayer, much to some people's chagrin of playing local multiplayer - on a PC/Mac. With a price tag of 3€ on sale - not 13€, seeing the small amount of content present in the game - Nidhogg is worth a try. Oh, and do play this game on a soundproof room: you'll be cussing a lot, especially when playing with your friends ;)			"

												This game is great when you have guests or friends coming over, although this game is a game you don't play everyday, it's a good game to keep especially when guests come over. You can even make your own custom tournaments (not literally) such as when five people are at your house you just pretend to make a branch. Fun game but just a type you wouldn't play a lot.			"

												Could be a really great game if it wasn't for the bugginess. Constant lag while playing over the network, even in the same house. Not good at all. Slighly worrisome considering they're releasing a second one next year and they haven't even fixed this one yet.			"

With a classic touch of the pixelgraphics and thorough gameplay mechanics, it's the ultimate 1v1 game.Want a game for you and your mates to really figure out who the pro gamer is?

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.			"

												First impressions: Easy to get into, good tunes, fun to play with friends (local VS play). Played the waifu and also some dudes at work. There were some good laughs.Online play: There are some really good players out there. Good times. Played several people online who were complaining about experiencing a lot of lag. Seemed okay to me most of the time. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. EDIT: booted me out mid-game with some find of CTD error. Maybe that's what's been happening with some people I've been playing (they'll unexpectedly quit the game)I'd like to see more maps - 4 is kinda spare. They're decent, though.I think $12 is asking a lot for this game, but hey, stop eating at McD's a few times and pack a freaking salad and a sandwich and you just earned that $12 back. Oh, and make your own coffee for a week so you can buy another game.EDIT 2: It's $5 on the Steam summer sale. $5 is about right, but look at how many hours I've played - 4h or so. Maybe I'll get back into it if the online play was ever fixed or if there is a more open version where people can make their own maps. Lots of games out there that have compelling 1v1 action, and this one is okay.			"

												For an indie game that has been on the radar for so long, sweeping up critical praise for years, there was a lot of expectation for this oddly titled game and it has delivered. Nidhogg has that quality that seems lost in most 3D AAA titles, and is becoming rarer even amongst 2D indie games. It gives you memories of titles as diverse as Flashback and the first Prince of Persia game, whilst the competitive play is on a par with classics such as Mario Kart, Unirally and Super Smash Brothers. I fear how many hours I could lose to the acid enduced lucid dream of a game and for that alone I must place it on the highest of pedestals along with the likes of only Speedrunners. This game justifies the price tag - Period. The animations are faultless, the levels well designed and engaging. The screenshots and video do not do this title justice. It needs playing.The only critique is a few spots of lag during online play, but the mode is still very playable and competitive.   "

												It's a fighting game, but not really: there are no ""super"" moves, power bars, or frame timings; just run, jump, and stab. It's easy to pick up and play, and within a few minutes you'll feel like you're accomplishing the most amazing series of maneuvers. There's no need to log 300 hrs of practice to get ""good"" here.I love the simplicity of it: movement, 5 ""stances"" (overhead, high, mid, low, crouch), a jump button, and an action button. That's it. Using combinations of those controls, you have access to a surprising variety of moves that help you push past a constantly respawning opponent, only to celebrate your victory by jumping into Níðhöggr's waiting maw.The one downside, though, is the price. $15 is crazy. $10 would've been MUCH better. I hope they continue to develop levels/content for this to help justify the price.There's a damn good reason this won so many IGF awards, and I'm glad it finally made it to a full release version. Thanks to the option to hold tournaments of up to 8 players, I can see this being an awesome party game, but hopefully they can flesh out the online multiplayer, as well as add more content, to keep people playing even after the party's over.

												One of the best 1 vs 1 games ever made, no doubt about it. It may look simple and the controls are simple as well, but the fighting is very complex. It's essentially a mix between rugby/american football and sword fighting. It starts with a duel, and whoever wins immediately gets to run in one direction, while the other keeps spawning in their way in order to kill them. If the defender kills him, he instantly becomes offense and gets to go in his direction, and the first person to their end wins, and is eaten by a dragon.Fast paced, swords, football, dragons. tenouttaten.

tl;dr -> If you ever wanted to stab your friends in the face while avoiding jail time, get this game and invite them over. 11/10 awesome fencing simulator.I got this game when it was a Steam Daily Sale, and was very happy with my purchase. A fantastic party game to play with friends, both online and locally.If you like 1 versus 1 gameplay, fencing, and fast-paced action, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very simple, but still good - the blood leakage effect whenever someone dies can result in the battlefield being painted in a variety of colors. The music and sounds are decent, but I prefer to play my own to add to the intensity of the combat. Controls are very simple, but mastering the combat system may take some practice. There is a quick tutorial that will help you learn everything you need to know. The learning curve is minimal - the most difficult thing being training yourself and your reflexes/reaction time. I've tried using both a controller and the keyboard, and either works perfectly - I personally prefer a controller.The gameplay is fast and relentless - your goal is to reach the opposite end of the map, while also preventing your opponent from doing the same. There are a series of areas to pass (the map is mirrored) before the ""final area,"" and if you pass this area you will continue on to the winners section. You can lunge with your sword or punch/divekick if you are unarmed. Throwing your sword is risky, but may be fruitful in the right situation. You can pick up any dropped sword, and an area may have plenty of swords (and blood) on the ground if you and your opponent are rapidly killing each other. You can do tricks like disarming your opponent by hovering up or down on their sword, and you can also sweep their legs to drop them to the ground. The ""right of way"" arrow shows who can continue down the map, and this is provided to whoever has achieved the latest kill. There are situations where both players can die - mostly falling to your death - and the right of way will be reset to no one. An interesting concept - and advantage - of having the right of way is that you don't necessarily have to kill your opponent each time. Instead, you can also try to dodge them and just keep running down the map. To counter this, you need to run in the opposite direction in order to spawn in front of the person with the right of way. There is a singleplayer mode that is fairly challenging, as well as a tournament mode (or just straight up versus, both online and local). Overall, the game is a fantastic party game that is very easy to learn and begin playing. Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Nidhogg, where do I start. Not much content, graphics simple yet fitting, laggy multiplayer, a seemingly boring soundtrack, and pretty decent combat. Fifteen dollars is not worth the lack of content this game provides, unless you have friends who live in your house, as tournaments are only local. The lack of maps is another downside to this game, but can be overlooked, as the maps included do have noticable differences. Swordplay is interesting, and takes some work to master. Matchmaking turns out to be horrendous unless you have friends to play with, as the matchmaking takes ten minutes to find a match, but when you do it is enjoyable. The gameplay provided is minimal, but what is provided is enjoyable. Overall, this title is not one for those who don't wish to put the work in to learn to master the excellent swordplay presented to them, but fifteen dollars is too much, this game is worth five or less.If however you do decide to purchase this game, watch the first duel in this video, as it shows all the tricks needed to suceed in Nidhogg-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWMlU8eKOsg "

												This isn't no slashy-stabby sword fighty gamey. Well, it is, but it's different. This, while being ironically pixelated, has a more realistic style of fighting. You can block, parry, stab, drop, spin, twirl,  lunge, even throw your dang sword at your opponent. The only downside to this is you realize you would be helpless in a real sword fight.10/10 Would cry againP.S. The ending to each level is terrifying. I nearly cried the first time I saw it. Why the developers decided to name the game after that horrific creature is a mystery.			"

												This isn't no slashy-stabby sword fighty gamey. Well, it is, but it's different. This, while being ironically pixelated, has a more realistic style of fighting. You can block, parry, stab, drop, spin, twirl,  lunge, even throw your dang sword at your opponent. The only downside to this is you realize you would be helpless in a real sword fight.10/10 Would cry againP.S. The ending to each level is terrifying. I nearly cried the first time I saw it. Why the developers decided to name the game after that horrific creature is a mystery.			"

												I purchased a number of copies of this game. Under the hopes that I could play it with a few friends.I couldn't.Because, contrary to the game's steam page, this game has no functional online mode. Everything is terribly laggy, which ruins any fighting game. Don't buy this game if you ever want to play online. You most likely can't.			"

tl;dr -> If you ever wanted to stab your friends in the face while avoiding jail time, get this game and invite them over. 11/10 awesome fencing simulator.I got this game when it was a Steam Daily Sale, and was very happy with my purchase. A fantastic party game to play with friends, both online and locally.If you like 1 versus 1 gameplay, fencing, and fast-paced action, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very simple, but still good - the blood leakage effect whenever someone dies can result in the battlefield being painted in a variety of colors. The music and sounds are decent, but I prefer to play my own to add to the intensity of the combat. Controls are very simple, but mastering the combat system may take some practice. There is a quick tutorial that will help you learn everything you need to know. The learning curve is minimal - the most difficult thing being training yourself and your reflexes/reaction time. I've tried using both a controller and the keyboard, and either works perfectly - I personally prefer a controller.The gameplay is fast and relentless - your goal is to reach the opposite end of the map, while also preventing your opponent from doing the same. There are a series of areas to pass (the map is mirrored) before the ""final area,"" and if you pass this area you will continue on to the winners section. You can lunge with your sword or punch/divekick if you are unarmed. Throwing your sword is risky, but may be fruitful in the right situation. You can pick up any dropped sword, and an area may have plenty of swords (and blood) on the ground if you and your opponent are rapidly killing each other. You can do tricks like disarming your opponent by hovering up or down on their sword, and you can also sweep their legs to drop them to the ground. The ""right of way"" arrow shows who can continue down the map, and this is provided to whoever has achieved the latest kill. There are situations where both players can die - mostly falling to your death - and the right of way will be reset to no one. An interesting concept - and advantage - of having the right of way is that you don't necessarily have to kill your opponent each time. Instead, you can also try to dodge them and just keep running down the map. To counter this, you need to run in the opposite direction in order to spawn in front of the person with the right of way. There is a singleplayer mode that is fairly challenging, as well as a tournament mode (or just straight up versus, both online and local). Overall, the game is a fantastic party game that is very easy to learn and begin playing. Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Nidhogg is to me more of a ""rat race"" to see who can win better than the other person, and is missing both the fun deep interactions of blazblue, and the wacky lighthearted nature or towerfall. Nidhogg isn't a terrible game, and you might like it, but I didn't.			"

												The game that my girlfriend and I are evenly matched in. The butt clenching is real and the button mashing can be evident. Nidhogg is one of those games that remind you of classical combat games in an arcade, it is one of the best indie platformer sword fighting games on the market at this price point. Saying that I think it is the only indie platformer sword fighting game around this price point.			"

												The game is great fun, Especially with a friend, However, On my first time playing, I completed the whole single player campaign with only losing once, The game is WAY too easy. Also, Only 4 levels??? I payed 12 bloody pounds for this game, This is the sort of game you download for free off of GameJolt or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its fun, But there are too many downers to this game that holds me back from reccomending it. Also, i was expecting an epic final boss of some kind. Because on images of the game, they are fighting on top of a huge shaking platform. That never happens in the whole game. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.

I have unbinded all my keyboard inputs that appear on the config screen yet I still get unpaused and sometimes if I really dont notice it exits out of the game.12-15 dollars for a game that isnt polished(because of above) nor is early access(where you can sort of excuse that kind of stuff).I really wish steam had a 3rd option for reviews.

												Nidhogg is a very simplistic representation of fencing where the goal is to reach the opponent's start point and get eaten by some giant creature presumably called the Nidhogg. The gameplay has a bit of a tug-of-war feel to it as dead players respawn a bit further back from where they were slain meaning you have to continuously battle all the way to the end without failing to win. Combat consists of moving your blade up/down, thrusting, rolling, throwing the blade, and jump kicks, combinations of which can be used to confuse and disable your opponent, setting them up for the kill. Once you kill an opponent, you gain the right of way and place him on the defensive, meaning that if you were to jump over him and continue towards his start, he would have to pursue you or allow himself to be scrolled off and respawn in front of you.Due to the overall simplicity of the game and small number of levels, it seems to suit itself more towards multiplayer than single player which is unfortunate because the multiplayer can get downright unplayable due to latency causing your inputs to get ignored or delayed. Additionally the controls can be awkward when shifting between stances not to mention you risk throwing your sword when shifting to stab high from a mid-stance. I originally had a bit more positive of a review for this game but after re-playing it I decided to drop my recommendation since the content is really lacking and not worth the base price (or really even the sale price).

												Nidhogg is absurdly fun.  The combat is similar to Divekick with its simple controls and surprising amount of depth in combat.  Once you kill your opponent you'll only have a few seconds to get as far as you can before you respawn.  Then you must decide if you're gonna take down your opponent again or try to run past him and go for the goal Randy Moss style.Nidhogg is not without its issues though.  There's nothing for PC specific options aside from volume sliders and the online play has a few issues which could potentially be a dealbreaker.Creating a lobby at first was an exercise in frustration.  The invite friends list is not alphabatized which isn't a huge deal if you don't have many Steam friends, but I have 200+ and it added extra time to what should be a simple process.  Once you invite someone the other person doesn't get a Steam notification, they have to hit ""Join Game"" from Steam friends.  There's no indication that you have to do this either.  Once you have this all figured out it works, but come on.  These are basic menu functions in any online game.In the games I played with my friend the host had a huge advantage because of latency, we had to swap hosting every few rounds to make it fair.  If you can play locally then you won't have to deal with this.  It's a perfect couch game if you are thinking of a Steambox solution.Despite my complaints about the game I've really enjoyed it so far, though with the issues I've mentioned above it's a little hard to recommend at full price.  Buy it on sale for sure.TL;DR version:  Buy if you have a friend to play with and can deal with a few online issues.EDIT1/14/2014 - The invite system works with Steam properly now, but the friends list in game is still not in alphabetical order.

Even though you can play the game, test the controls, and see what works for you! I didn't even realize there was such a mode and I mastered the controls in just 5 minutes of trial and error play!And then you can play multiplayer locally AND online.Easily one of the best games I've ever played!Addicting, hair pulling, and fun to the last pixelated drop of blood!       10/10			"

												Nidhogg is a two player fencing duel to the death, where each player attempts to defeat the other repeatedly as they head to the opposite side of the stage from their starting position to be eaten by the dragon at the end of the world. No, really. There's a single player mode, but it's not where the game shines. The AI is unpolished, as it occasionally goes dumb and lets you mow it down. Far better is beating a friend in person. The netcode for the game is currently (as of release day) a bit rough and confers quite a host advantage at the moment.Don't let that deter you. Grab it now while it's 20% off and get to stabbin' your friends!			"

												Wow. Another luck game. How fun.Nidhogg tried to be a competitive, fast paced fighting game. It really tried.However, when the cpu on single-player mode constantly matches your sword position, making them practically impossible to kill, the fun factor, believe it or not, is DEcreased.It's a game of hoping when you press e to ATTEMPT to stab your opponent, they switch their sword position at the last moment and you kill them.That's it, ladies and gents. You attempt to stab a mirror of yourself.Thank god I bought this on sale and not for the ripoff price of $15.			"

												A very good game with pretty simple, yet very compelling and complex, mechanics. You use few buttons, but it is hard to master it. The game works pretty well and everything makes sense. Nothing, here, will feel really unfair.You can have a good time with friends, offline or online, and may even like to play a bit in the singleplayer mode (although it is too simple and not that fun). But, I can't really recommend this gameThe reason is that this game, for some reason, has almost no online player playing it and it is almost impossible to find a random person online to play in the matchmaking. I don't know if this is a problem of the game, or what, but it is a problem. For those that don't have too many friends to play with, this game will fall shortly of things to do. And, also, for a considerably high price. But go for it, if you want just to play with friends.			"

												I personally loved this game, it encompasses so much that I use to love as a child all in one package.The game plays like a mix between Marshmellow Duels (an old DOS based Super smash Brlos styled game) and Prince of Persia Classic (I doubt this needs exaplining)The game might look simple and to be honest it is and it isn't. The amazing thing about this game is when you play as a noob with another noob you can pretty much have fun screwing up togther. If you are both hardcore u can stay minutes on one level, and feel your adrenaline rush.Now if you play as a noob against a good player expect the match to be over ina  matter of seconds in some cases. The game is simple but it's also very skill friendly, so if your good > bad players and luck plays very little here.There are only a hand full of levels but you will want to keep playing them over and over again. The online and local multiplayer is where the game shines. It turns this great game into a fantastic game. You will only play with Ai when you have no internet or people over, other than that you will never want to vs ai again.9.0/10 at full price9.5/10 on saleThe reason for different scores is because the game is fairly expensive for what it offers, but the mechanics are so clean and simple that it can make up for it even at full price for some.If your not a fan of retro or fencing styled games (ninja fencing in this case) don't bother with this game. It's graphics are charming to those that can appreciate them, and the game play to those that love the genre:)			"

												Be warned: very iffy netcode! The possiblity of you and an online friend having a lagless game is very low.It has already been said  that the game is very short for the price it's going, but I'm still recommending Nidhogg, in local multiplayer.The beauty of Nidhogg lies in its comical gameplay. Everything is very stabby-runaway-spawn-around-the-corner franticness, which benefits this game massively. So if all of this:-Throwing a sword in the back of the head of your fleeing foe.-Losing your sword but gaining the advantage by a combo salto-kick. -Snapping your foe's neck after you've tripped him.-Earning the right of being eaten by the almighty Nidhogg and thus showing the world that you're a worthy meal. sounds like fun to you, you should probably get this game.

												When I first got this game, I played it and realized me and my friend had immense ping lag. So we couldn't play. My computer is crap, so even in windowed mode it still kind of lags, but that's my pc's fault, not the games. Anyway, after playing it for a while, I've fallen in love with this game. It's gameplay is tense, and can be extremely fast paced, or slow and strategic. Sometimes you just trash people, and are able to get eaten in half a minute or so. Or their are those matches that are slow, and you have to plan, parry, and use every skill available to you to complete it. It's one of the funnest games I've ever played, and I definitly reccomend.			"

												Hello everyone first of all and I'm gonna review Nidhogg to you. Let's start...NİDHOGG-Nidhogg is a very very very arcade game for who likes basic games and doesn't care graphics...-This game got a single player mod but I'm sure when you finished the campaign -campaign ends less than 8 minutes if you are a pro of games like that- you play again again and, wait for it... :D, again the campaign.-If you like this game as single player I'm sure you will like the multiplayer mod than single one...FİNAL DECİSİON-You can like a genre but if something very very very successful in this class you want to play that game whatever you don't like the genre... And Nidhogg is a game kind of that if you as to the people, they never gonna say ""We need an arcade game!"" but they say something like that ""We want more gun more Call of Duty more WAR!!!"" but when a brave one makes a game kind of Nidhogg people understand the true game is not the Call of Duty, the true game is exactly Nidhogg...Sorry for bad English it isn't my main language...MARK: 8,9 / 10			"

												When I first got this game, I played it and realized me and my friend had immense ping lag. So we couldn't play. My computer is crap, so even in windowed mode it still kind of lags, but that's my pc's fault, not the games. Anyway, after playing it for a while, I've fallen in love with this game. It's gameplay is tense, and can be extremely fast paced, or slow and strategic. Sometimes you just trash people, and are able to get eaten in half a minute or so. Or their are those matches that are slow, and you have to plan, parry, and use every skill available to you to complete it. It's one of the funnest games I've ever played, and I definitly reccomend.			"

												Nidhogg is a down right brutal fighting game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. There are only a few moves you can do, but this means it's less of a button smash than the likes of Street Fighter. It also means that it can be anybody's game, and many times matches will go for minutes on end because there are so many comebacks.The presentation is very slick. The fighters and their animations stand out well enough to keep the focus on the action, but the backgrounds can be as pretty as ever, even though they are largely simple. The music is brilliantly fitted to every stage, so it's all wrapped up with a neat little bow.The singleplayer will take anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour to complete, but the real heart of this game is in the multiplayer. The store page cites a lot of issues with online multiplayer, yet I haven't had any issues outside of one match where there was some lag. Either way you owe it to yourself to play this with local multiplayer instead, to see the reactions of your opponents.It's more worth $10 in my opinion, but if you can find this on a sale, there's no doubt that you should pick it up.

												Nidhogg is a fun split screen multiplayer despite the cheap and lazy art design. The games are quick, fast, and enjoyable to play with friends. When I find games like these with great mechanics I wonder if the devs just got lucky amongst a sea of indie games or they have some talent. Either way this game’s mechanics are solid and fun. I got this game for $1 in a humbe but I enjoy it enough that I would recommend purchasing it for as much as $3.I give this a 5/10. It would have been a 7/10 if the graphics were better. If this game had a sequel with more content and more polished graphics I’d buy it. "

												This game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥It's a fast-paced two-player dueling game. You can fence madly, cartwheel away, throw your rapier, somersault through the air, snatch a rapier off the ground and skewer your opponent through the guts, you can rush unarmed at your opponent only to roll beneath his drawn rapier at the last moment, trip him with  a sweep of the leg, tear his heart out, grab his rapier and keep running. You can pull off all kinds of insane stunts, and I can't help but laugh every time. This gameplay is accompanied by an equally frenzied soundtrack and trippy neon graphics. The great art direction and style of this game is undeniable.Multiplayer is online and local, and there is also a singleplayer mode where you fight a computer opponent. It's not as fun as desperately outsmarting a human opponent. The online multiplayer introduces a ton of lag and causes many maneuvers to be impossible to pull off. That said, I've been mainly playing online opponents (haven't had the chance to play local yet), and it's been some of the most exhilarating multiplayer gameplay I've experienced, despite the lag.There aren't many games where you can do a somersault, but this is one of them. It feels great.On the downside, there are only 4 stages. What you'll get out of this game will depend on how much you put into it and on the people you play against. Best suited for playing with friends, two controllers and a tv.			"

												This game is awesome, don't get me wrong. To make your friends rage in a local battle is simply amazing but overall, I don't recommend this game. Internet multiplayer is dead, I could not caught a single person to play with. The content is very minimal, featuring only four maps and singleplayer gets boring really quickly. I bought Nidhogg on sale for a very low price (aprox. two euros) and I don't feel like I got my moneys worth. So don't even think on buying this game for its full price. If you want to have some fun play sessions with your friends, I would recommend it for a low price during sales. But no more than that.

												I bought this game with online multiplayer in mind. The game's online multiplayer is insanely broken. I tested it with two of my buds and I was the one invited both times. Each time they said it ran fine while I was struggling to even thrust the sword or even make a simple ♥♥♥♥ing jump. If you don't plan on playing multiplayer, then feel free to download it, otherwise, it really isn't worth the buy.EDITI recently picked it back up after hearing of the patch for online play. As far as I could tell, the patch was a complete success. I could play it completely fine and there was no trouble for either end. The reason I still don't reccommend this game is simple because of the price. The game has many mechanics that I can't even begin to wrap my head around, but I still feel $15 is way too much for what it is. I'm not trying to make little of the game itself, but I personally think I could find a game that would last longer for less than the price of this game.			"

												Fun game but buggy on Windows 7 64bit. First level plays but not the next level will not let you click. Also it seems online play is broken I hope the developer can fix this in a later date give this game life again.			"

												This is a must own for anyone and everyone. The game is entirely skill based, so depending on how much time you put into  the game over your opponents will determine your fate. It is wonderfully silly in it's local multiplayer, and even more so when the terrible lag hits an online match which makes for a clusterglitch of epic proportions. The music and sound design alone is amazing, and blends so well with the art. Overall I'd give it a Nid/Hogg			"

												Pro:Nice concept, nice music, weird but fun ending. Contra:Not usable via LAN.We tried with different persons, it works for some minutes before desync starts. But it still seems like there is something because the enemy who gets everytimes in front of you is still stabbing and hopping and whatever, just not what you would expect from him. (I think it might be on his side too, just mirrored)Well, it looks like it is mentioned in the forum more than once that a technique like GGPO would help.Fazit:It might be nice in SP but it was bought for the LAN for about 3,74 Euro, price is okay, but not more.

												Nidhogg is perfect example that fighting games can offer more variety than what most of its competition would lead to believe.The game is ultimately a game of tag with the objective being to run to your goal. You become ""it"" when you defeat your opponent or they suicide. Whenever you die or trail off-screen, you will generally respawn in your opponent's path a few moments later. When you spawn, you are given a fencing sword to use in combat with the other player, but you can also fight unarmed if you throw your sword or you can also pick-up a sword dropped earlier on that section of the stage map. There is a decent variety of options that are simplistic in execution but add a lot of depth to the game, especially when used in conjunction with the terrain of the stage.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys versus multiplayer games, not just fans of the fighting game genre.

Don't let it's simple concept and graphics fool you, this game is unbelievably fun. You'll be laughing your♥♥♥♥♥♥off at fluked victories and fumbled suicides as you play against your friends. Nidhogg is a great example of mechanics (gameplay) over aesthetics (graphics), proving that being FUN TO PLAY is the single most important part of game design; these developers could teach Square Enix a thing or two... but don't get me started on that old chestnut.

												THIS GAME IS REALLLY GOOD SH*TI for one highly reccomend this game to anyone who has a friend they can play localy with because its the multiplayer that really sells this game.why its fun:the game nidhogg is fast paced and incredibly unforgiving at times while at others the sensation felt on the victory screen after the final showdown is like the equivelent of that found in no other game (outside of pummling invaders in darksouls)Its gameplay is basic, your objective is to run one direction while halting the progress of your opponent who must advance the opposite direction. you have a very small set of moves (the game uses all of about 4 buttons) yet the combos and tactics you must instill to win are outright amazing.I highly reccomend this game and hope for add on stages in the future (as the stages are the only lacking part of the game. ) or a way to play 2v2 or the likes.

												Nidhogg is a fast paced fencing game that would be perfect if not for the totally broken online multiplayer.The gameplay is fun as it should be and pretty complicated for a game that uses only two buttons + arrows.Fortunately, local multi works fine.			"

												What looks like a fast-paced tactical fun bit of fencing, is a stressful torturous sequence with poorly laid out rules, and no victory or defeat passing without ""That was Bull****!"" from your opponent.The psychadelic backgrounds in certain stages work far too well at being disorientating, as the game becomes physically painful to play, bringing on headaches and RSI after bare minutes of playing.

												I don't know what ""Messhof"" was smoking when he deployed this game. You can't charge 15 bucks for a game with 2 HOURS OF CONTENT.I can say nothing bad about the gameplay in Nidhogg. It's solid. It's tight. If you're a fighter-nut, you'll probably like this game. But to hell with gameplay. For this price, it doesn't matter how good or fun your game is: if it only lasts me an hour or two, the game is a rip-off. That's what Nidhogg is. A big, fat, Mexican-style rip-off. I can't get my money back, but hopefully I can convince some other person who is dumb like me not to buy this turd-nugget.The game's main selling point is the multiplayer. If you don't have friends to play with locally, you can't play it, because the matchmaking can never find anyone and even if it does, online matches are super laggy.Don't buy this game. I swear, the nerve of some game developers nowadays...			"

												Judging from the videos (and user reviews) I thought that this could be a very fun game for vs matches with people. That's why I decided to support the developers (even though the price seemed a bit high). The problem here is that first and foremost I bought having in my mind that this game will provide a very fun experience in online multiplayer, trying to beat someone in one-on-one fights. I'm certain that if it worked it would be extremely fun. But that's a BIG if.In the description of the game it says that it supports online matches, and this is the main (if not the only) reason that I bought the game. The severe lag in every single match makes this game practically unplayable in the online environment. It's worth also mentioning that the single player mode can be finished in less than half hour and certainly isn't a mode worthy of the price tag.Because of the broken online multiplayer mode I feel ripped off by this game, considering that I payed 12 euros mainly for a feature advertised that isn't working.

												Bah. I want to like Nidhogg, but the arbitrariness of the outcome of the fencing leaves me frequently frustrated. Sometimes you can disarm an opponent and run him right through, only to find the kill doesn't register. The AI is particularly dangerous when disarmed - it will almost always respond with a lightning-quick head-kick, then steal your epee and skewer you with it, all in the split second after you've sent his own weapon spinning!I'm also puzzled by what governs the respawning time - sometimes opponents will return almost immediately, while at other times there's a long wait.Since this core duelling element is really all there is to the game, you'd think it would be much, much tighter. For £10, I was expecting either a lot more variation or a simple mechanic honed to perfection, but you don't really get either.			"

												Having played a bit of the single-player I can honestly say this game is not for me. I heard it's all about the multiplayer, but I haven't tried it yet and I don't think I'll ever will. The single player portion is just so frustratingly boring that it couldn't hold my attention for even 30 minutes. The art style is nice and the game is nicely animated, but if you're mostly a solo gamer (like me) don't buy this. If you play multiplayer too, then by all means give it a try.[Rating: 65/100]			"

												This game has a lot of potential.It's a fun and frantic dueling game with simple pixel graphics. The game is a lot of fun when played with others wether online or  locally. There are some glaring problems though. It's controller support is lacking as I can only get my wired X360 controller to work which just won't cut it for such a precise game. Using the keyboard makes the game impossible as it requires faster input then a keyboard can offer. Unless you pay for a non-ghosting keyboard which is expensive then you'll lose every battle. The perfect controller for this game is a USB NES controller which for some reason isn't supported at all.This game has been in development for like 4 years and it's not like it's very advanced or deep. Knowing this and seeing low quality graphics, the lack of digital controller support and bugs all over the place I can not recommend this game at $15 or even at it's sale price. It just seems lazy and unfinished. I was hoping for a much better experience then I recieved. Spend that $15 on something else.			"

												Buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Literally every time I have tried to play it (about 9 tries, spread across two days), a different bug has rendered the game unplayable: I might not be able to attack, for example. Or the game might suffer incredible slowdown, to the point that it resembles QWOP. Or I might be unable to pause. Or unable to stop running to the left. I have continued trying, closing then reopening the game several times for a few hours at a time, and while there are a few stretches where it plays well and I could recommend it, it just isn't worth the hair-pulling. Until or unless it recieves a patch, I would warn anyone considering buying Nidhogg that there are better ways to spend your money.			"

												Nidhogg is 2D fencing game where you fight a bunch enemies to be the number one fencer. But will you want to play it ? In Nidhogg you play as a yellow fencer guy who tries to be the fencer which means to defeat the toughest enemies. So how is this game ? Its actually quite fun and i would suggest everyone to buy it. Now for the good things. Graphiclly the game looks great and its a blast to play. It also has a great soundtrack and plus its a challenge to play because every level you play gets harder as you go. Now for the bad things. The game is incredibly short you can beat it in half hour. Now for the price its going for that feels like a rip off. Many of the levels repeat themselfs as you go on. Theres only 4 arenas and all of them repeat which is bad since the game is short as it is. Theres also a Multiplayer feature which is pretty fun. Overall the game isnt worth it at full price and only worth it if you get it on sale. I give Nidhogg a 7/10			"

The problem is most likely on my end, but I get 500 ms ping and 500 ms input delay when I try matchmaking.But that's fine, I mean, that's the LEAST of netcode related issues for me. Get this: I don't know if it's latency related, my computer's net name related, my connection type related, the DNS server I'm using or whatever, BUT MY FPS DROPS TO LITERAL SLIDESHOW LEVEL IN MULTIPLAYER.

I knew netcode is absolute garbage in this game, but then I heard an update fixed it somewhat. How bad it must have been to begin with if THIS is the ""fixed"" netcode?

Probably won't refund it on an off chance I'll play this locally one day, got it dirt cheap anyway. Game's reasonably fun even against AI opponents, who get stupidly hard after you cycle through 4 maps this game has.And another funny thing happened: I bought 2 copies of this game, and offered it to 5 of my steam friends who were online at that moment. Nobody wanted to accept it. Steam users? Declining free games? I wonder why that is.TL;DR: great game in here somewhere, brilliant idea killed in its infancy by the ♥♥♥♥♥iest netcode known to man.

												The game's polished as could be hoped for, and is reasonably good detecting hits (in local games) and giving a variety of environments to fight in (doors, tall grass, clouds, etc). It's different, for sure. And if you're more into playing something new rather than playing something that you'd like to love forever, Nidhogg is the game for you, and I recommend it.Unfortunately for anyone who wants to be competitive, or has played games for more than a few years, the achilles heel of Nidhogg is its controls. They're sloppy. It's very difficult to translate your decisions into game actions, and generally leads to both players in the game twisting their faces and going ""what? Why is it doing that? That's not what I'm doing. Are you seeing this?""In Nidhogg, there are only six buttons. left/right/up/down, jump, and lunge. Left/right and jump/lunge are pretty straightforward - they only do one action apiece. They move you left/right, or they jump or lunge you. No ambiguity. However, up/down are extremely overloaded. They toggle the state of your guard (low, mid, high) as well as allow you to throw your sword (up + lunge), *and* allow you to crouch (down, but only from a low guard), *and* roll (down, but only while sprinting). The problem with this is it leads to needing to combine too many identical keys for totally different actions. You'll find that the game decides you wanted to throw your sword, even though you only tapped up to go to a high guard to lunge at your opponent. Or it will dutifully force you into a crouch when you just wanted to go between low guard and midguard. There doesn't seem to be event queueing, so while you wait for one animation to finish, any further input is discarded. This means that if you're trying to rapidly go between high and mid guards, more often than not you'll press the keys *too fast* and get stuck between a high guard and the ""throwing stance"". Don't believe me? Make a macro and try going between guards to quickly.It's an intentional design, but it seems wrongheaded. A better system would have been to have a button dedicated to throwing the sword, a button specific to crouching, and allow modifier keys to go between guards. e.g., right trigger moves you into a high guard, left trigger to a low guard, and if neither are held down, then you're in a midguard. Throwing would be a separate key, and crouching could be opposite the jump key. With this setup, every decision you make can be unambiguously done with two keys, tops.Even if the designers wanted the default behavior to be limiting and sloppy, they could have at least given more thought to the keybindings - to at least give players the *option* of having the sort of system i mentioned above. The controls are so crusted together than you can't even bind mouse buttons to game actions. Aren't we on PCs? Isn't part of the point of PC to have customization and playstyle adjustments?If you're determined to like the game, you can always get used to the controls and hope they don't bite you too often. I'm sure that with ten or fifteen hours, anyone could get used to the game's quirks. But ask yourself if you really want to go through that.			"

												TL;DR: Buy for local mutiplayer only.I don't really know how I can express my hatred toward this game. The worst part about that, is that it is quite a good game.The game is funny to play with friend for a time, graphics and music are very well made.But first, the game looks extremely aggressive, there is always a flickering element in any moment of the game and it flickers quite fast too, graphics are gory and depict many things not nice to watch.Second thing, the content is very low, 4 maps, you can't change players colours.Third thing, the AI is very badly done, it is not funny at all to play single player.Another thing I need to add, the game sometimes doesn't care if you modify your control setup and sometimes doesn't register some of your inputs, playing this game is kinda playing lotery: you know it can be nice but if you try too much it will most certainly brings more pain than pleasure.Last thing online mutiplayer is very crappy.To conclude, this game is good so if you want to take it consider only for local battles with friends and only a few times.For people who are willing to rate this review down, I am willing to hear why.

You only get around 4 levels and they are all the same with varying difficulty. This should be free or AT MOST $0.25. Kinda fun though. Too simple and too difficult for me because I've never really been good at these kinds of games.

												frantic, accurate, tense. The three words that first pop into my mind when I think of the heart-pounding matches I've played in Nidhogg. Play with your overly competitive neighbor for best results. Watch as the boundaries of society melt away after only two short matches! Yelling! Incomprehensible guttural sounds! Flying controllers! Nidhogg is a competitive 2D sidescrolling fencing game. With four levels to choose from, players compete to reach the great Nidhogg, a gigantic worm creature who eats champions of battle in order to honor them approximately 8 hrs. later through projectile elimination from the tippy top of the stratosphere. That's right. You're competing for the opportunity to be eaten and♥♥♥♥♥♥out in a blast of glory. Do I even need to say more? 10/10			"

Then it turns up on Steam 12 months later. Crazy, my illusions were shattered. So. Do you have someone you can sit next to for 30 minutes and 2 controllers? Great, get this game. You will have a heckuva time. Get drunk / stoned prior and it will be even more awesome. You're sold, right?!			"

If you don't have instantaneous reaction times, the best you can do is delay an inevitable loss. If you lose your sword, the AI will kill you, 100% of the time. If you manage to disarm the AI, they will punch you in the face until you die. The controls are unresponsive and half the time I'm throwing my sword away when I want to lunge.			"

												This game seems sorta bloated, as it looks like an old 16 vga game but still somehow manages to have terrible slowdown when switching rooms and hitches on my modern laptop which really ruined the fun- especially  since this is a very twitchy fighting game. It was also advertised as being controller friendly but I couldn't get it to recognize my 2nd controller no matter what, and I ended up having to use JoyToKey  >:EIt IS fun, but I also don't understand why this was in development for so long. We basically cruised through all the available levels within 20 minutes.I was really looking forward to Nidhogg but it didn't quit fufill the hype. I'd highly recommend Samurai Gunn instead of this.			"

												This game is SO ♥♥♥♥ing instense! Playing through the single player, I was sweating profusely and yelling at the screen in excitement. The gameplay is entirely skillbased, making for very fun competitive play. Also I absolutely love the aesthetic of the game. It's as if you the player are trapped in some hellish drug induced nightmare, with a whole crowd of faceless stick-men watching you die over and over again. Unfortunately, The multiplayer is lacking. A friend and I tried it and found it to be extremely laggy for whoever isn't the host. However so, I still highly recommend giving this game a try considering the discounted price of $1.49 (Steam Summer Sale 2015).			"

												For all the hype and hoopla surrounding this game it's little more than a 20-30 minute distraction.  A FUN little distraction though.Any game where 2 players can go head-to-head with the exact same move/abilities in a streamlined game world is a good thing. Nidhogg succeeds in presenting this basic and streamlined local co-op experience. It is just Player vs Player with fencing swords.  No powerups, no game assists, no anything. And that's why, after 20 minutes of play, my co-op partner and I realized that it was time to turn it off and not ever play it again.I estimate that for the average player the game has at most 1 hour of playability.  Consider that when evaluating how much $$$ you think this game is worth.			"

												Nidhogg is a minimalist game at a MAXIMUM price. The core concept of the game is very sound, with sword fighting mechanics that feel balanced and fun. However, the amount of content you get for $15 is absolutely appalling. There is a 30 minute single player mode with no story or explanation of what a Nidhogg is, in fact there is no story to the game whatsoever. Every character is the same with no unique stats or abilities, and there are only 4 stages to play on. Some variety can be found in multiplayer, where you can set up custom rules like low gravity, sudden death, and no swords... but none of those options are available in online matches. There is also only one game type, albeit a fun and exciting one. Online is fun, but about 1 out of 10 matches suffer from lag, which is absolutely ridiculous for a game this simple. There is a leaderboard only for times clearing single player, the game does not track your win/lose record, you can't even pick the color of your character online... it's always yellow vs orange. No ranking, nothing to unlock. Offline multiplayer is far better if you have a group to play with... it's definitely a fantastic party game, but could have been so much more. Nidhog doesn't even have a widescreen mode or any resolution options, so if you are playing on a widescreen monitor or TV, you will have black bars on each side. Thankfully the music is fantastic, because you'll be hearing it over and over again on the same four stages. Controller support is also very limited, the game will recognize a Xbox 360 controller, but fails to register my Mad Catz Fightstick Pro (although I can get it to work using joy2key). Nidhog feels like an early access game, and certainly does nothing to justify a $15 price tag. I got the game at 20% off and I still regret it. This will be my first and last Messhof game.  "

												This game is one of the most annoying games I've ever played in my entire life. And the sad thing is, it's not even much of a problem with the game itself. It can be quite fun if you can get the hang of the gameplay and its modes.So why is this game so fricken annoying?The Community who plays it.CS:GO is basically running around Dust II with an AWP for 7 hours straight with middle aged men who sit in their mothers basement all day.The community finds pleasure in wasting hundreds of dollars just for a stupid rainbow camo on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ $95 knife they bought with their dads credit card. I can't stand having to play with these people, and that's a shame since the game isn't all that bad. But this lame community really bogs down the experience.Dont buy this casual, uninspired, nameless shooter. It will either annoy you, or you will become just another pawn in this corporate conglomerate of a game. Do yourself a favor by avoiding CS:GO at all costs.			"

												Absolutely the worst thing to come along in gaming since Pong.  Even that was actually worth something when it came out though.. so this game... is an insult to Pong when compared to each other.The controls are horrible, there is no such thing as ""swordplay"" as you stand toe to toe switching the height of your ""sword"", there is nothing you can do if you lose your sword and only the computer can block a thrown sword.. and once your sword is gone, you're dead.  No chance at all.Worst game I've played.. and I've played hundreds of thousands of bad games.			"

												Bought this game, instant regret.. The ♥♥♥♥ing ""how to play"" torturial is bugged as ♥♥♥♥, it litterally just tell you how to move! Not only that it ♥♥♥♥ing dosen't explain anything else! You litterally get dumbed in a game, that looked like it got kicked in the nuts and lost all it's pixels, and not only that, the ♥♥♥♥ing enemies are at a level that is way beyond yours. This is litterally like Day Z, in the way that it's agonizing death over and over again! Another agonizing annoyance about the game: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you play as is too big of a wuss, meaning that he can't ♥♥♥♥ing hold on to his sword ! He's like an autistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with parkinson syndrome -.-			"

												Nidhogg is a neat little game, that is fun paced, and with hotseat support. The drawback is that it doesn't have that much to offer, and can get a little boring after a while. For the price tag of 13.99, i find the game sadly not worth it, because of the lack of content. A little more content, and the game would get a thumbs up from me.			"

												If you don't know what somebody means when they praise a game for its tight controls, look no further than Nidhogg. This game is just as fun to watch as it is to play, whether the players are both novices or experts. You'll get sucked in by the approachable simplicity to this dueling game, but it has incredible depth before you can claim mastery. If you can play single-player mode all the way to the end, you'll have mastered it or gotten very lucky (it happens).Nidhogg is like Joust meets Street Fighter. Or maybe Ninja Gaiden meets Bushido Blade.			"

												When I first heard about Nidhogg, it sounded like a dream. There were whispers in multipayer communities about a rise of local multiplayer games that truly captured the imagination. The rise of games like Samurai Gunn and Towerfall Ascension have been popping up in the gaming scene, and it has been much better for it. Nidhogg, much like the aformentioned titles, offers that same sort of experience to players.Nidhogg could be describe as a combat simulator, but of the flashy variety. It offers various levels of play with a basic control scheme. At first glance the game seems a little lacking in levels, but once you dive in the game reveals it's levels of depth. In some regards it seems similar to the high level of play found in a Smash Bros Melee game. Some levels provide a ""gimmick"" to playing them, as others offer simplicity. The Stages, Castle and Mines, offer the most straightforward approach to combat, while other levels lik Clouds and Wilds offer more strategic play for more wilely players.When picking up the game, it's important to ask why you're doing it. This is not for the solitary experience, certainly not worth the price point. Get some friends together and have yourself a classic gaming night.			"

												i honestly dont care if its an old arcade game or something, the combat system and mechanics are so addicting and fun and going through the single player levels are very fun, challenging all of the different colored knights and finishing off by defeating the rainbow knights. they also have multiplayer which is very fun. 10/10 would play again			"

												I would highly recommend Nidhogg, but only if you have friends to play with locally. It's some of the most fun I've had playing local multiplayer, but the online doesn't work terribly well. The game is easy to pick up and you can teach someone to play in 15 seconds, but it's relatively deep and there is a lot to the combat, especially if both players have gotten good at it. Very few times have I felt I lost because of chance, or felt the game was unfair to me. I always lost because I made a mistake, or I didn't react fast enough. There isn't much content in the game though, as there are only four stages and the singleplayer is just a 'fight a.i. opponents until you lose, or beat them all' game and there aren't any additional modes. Unless you plan on having friends over to play a lot, I'd be hesitant to buy the game at it's full $15 dollar price tag. If you can pick it up on sale, or if you play local multiplayer a lot, then go for it.			"

												Nidhogg is a fantastic game with loveable visuals and top notch gameplay.The only problem is the single player campaign is 30 minutes long and is most certainly not worth the retail price.If this game was under £1 then yeah, fair enough.

												really challenging but so rewarding. It's a game that actually makes you feel skilled, while there is the ocassional lucky strike, most of the time taking down an enemy relies on skills and techniques that you learn yourself. The mechanics of this game are brilliant, there is one key for an attack but so many possibilities and combinations for attacks it will take a while to master and fully understand the game.One of the most stand out games I've played in a long time.I will say this though, set up your own controls. The control settings as they stand are designed for two people to play using the same keyboard, after some minor tweaking you'll find the optimal set up for yourself.			"

												This game is quick and dirty.  The single player ""campaign"" takes less then an hour.  But the multiplayer....that is a thing of beauty.  Nidhogg's multiplayer is the kind of game that should be played on a movie screen or by Fred Savage in The Wizard.  It is one of those perfect little games that you could just play over and over and over and laugh as you skewer your friends or rip their face off(?!).  All that being said....I wish there was a bit more to the game.  There are only 4 levels to fight on and a pretty barebones options screen.  If this game was beefed up a little bit, it would be one of the most popular and timeless multiplayer games ever made.  "

												 Nidhogg is a game that has been wowing the tournament crowds for a little while and now the rest of us get a chance to see what all the fuss is about. A one on one fencing the game, it is a pure test of skill against an opponent much in the same way Street Fighter or IK+ is. On the service Nidhogg is a simple game. You have to get your fencer to run across the level and reach your opponents end zone. Here you are eaten by the big worm Nidhogg thing and pronounced the winner. In order to do this you need to repeatedly best your enemy as you progress. Starting in the middle of the level you need to kill your opponent and run, after a short time your opponent will respawn and you fight again. If your opponent kills you they can then run the opposite direction in an attempt to regain ground.There are four levels to fight on which offer different environmental challenges and obstacles to use to your advantage. The castle has rooms and pits, so you can try and force your opponent to jump a pit and land on your sword or stay in a room so they can’t jump over you. The mine has a low ceiling which nullifies the ability to throw the sword or jump over your opponent, The clouds have disappearing ledges and the wilderness has platforms and long grass which allow for more manoeuvring and hiding.The only stage that doesn’t really work is the cloud stage as it’s just a bit much for your eyes to deal with; it’s also a bit dull compared to the others. The Wilderness reminded us of a 2D version of Bushido Blade which is certainly no bad thing at all.The fencer has a range of moves and techniques at their disposal. They can roll, cartwheel and jump which can be used to try and sneak past opponents if they have their sword at the wrong height. You can also perform a dive kick which knocks opponents over and makes them drop their sword. When an opponent is on the ground death can be dealt via a swift neck break. With the sword in hand you can thrust at three different heights. This works in a rock, paper, scissors kind of way and also defends against things like dive kicks depending on where you have the sword set. If you wish you can also throw your sword, however, if it’s parried you then leave yourself open to almost certain death.These basic moves form the crux of your sword fighting strategy and can be used in a number of different ways in order to best your opponent. If you are feeling super confident you can also disarm your opponent by moving your sword to the correct position at the exact right moment. Get this wrong though and you will find your own sword flying away.Essentially, this is a two player game and anyone going into it expecting a lengthy single player component will be disappointed. Single player acts as an arcade mode where you continually square off against computer controlled opponents on the games four levels. It’s practice for multiplayer and while a nice distraction it will only last you half an hour or so.The game uses a bright, 8-bit styled, colour palette to build its world. The colour scheme is garish but somehow seems to work. As a fencer is slain they explode into coloured dots and quickly begin to cover the arena in pixelated blood. It helps to highlight where the choke points are in each level as well as provide some visual flair.There’s no denying that Nidhogg is an excellent two player experience. It provides the same sort of adrenaline rush as all the best one on one fighting games and the mechanics work really well. However, we can’t help but feel that more could have been done here. There is certainly scope for a roaring Prince of Persia or Defender of the Crown style single player adventure. Even something like taking the Blood Valley (it’s an old, bad, 8 bit game), template and adding the superior gameplay of Nidhogg could work. Another option would be to have more stages. Having just four levels does make the package feel a little sparse. You could have had stages requiring some basic climbing or less footholds etc. Anyone who plays the game is going to have a great time and this is some of the best multiplayer action around at the minute. However, it could have been much more fleshed out in both single and multiplayer. The mechanics are great; we just hope there’s some further development of the other elements in the future as it could lead to something really special.Overall 7/10			"

												Nidhogg is one of those games that you really have to play to understand. You try to explain the game to somebody and you end up making it sound like a horrible game.It is anything but. Nidhogg is an adrenaline fueled rollercoaster ride with fencing, karate moves, one-hit KOs and most importantly, dive kicks.To even attempt to describe how hype this game is would be a crime. I purchased Nidhogg and my friends and I were playing it for two hours straight and yelling the entire time.A must purchase.			"

I picked this up after watching a youtuber play it briefly... again, mother of god...I used to play a hyper realistc fighting sim on playstation called Bashido Blade.. to me, this game is Bashido Blade reimagined on Atari. The one hit kill, fencing based combat combined with the push style arenas are absurdly intense. After playing the CPU about halfway through all the levels, all i could think of was calling up all my childhood fighting game rivals over to check out this new beast. The bumping beats and intense gameplay make this a helluva game for enthusiasts of intense melee combat.			"

												I would like to be able to recommend this game, though because of the price tag I cannot. $15 dollars is incredibly steep for what 'very little' this game actually has to offer. It can be very fun if u play against a mate to fill in 10 minutes every now and than, like waiting for other friends to come online to play a game together. It really isn't worth it though sorry. Wait for it to go down in price, way, way down. It should only be $5 to start with anyway.			"

												This game is great. Ridiculously simple, yet deceptively challenging, Nidhogg provides an experience like no other: the thrill of stabbing your silhouette-man opponent in the face so you can get eaten by a giant worm... thing.Seriously though, the game is very good. I've seen virtually no fencing games, so this game is in a very small category, but it does capture the feel of a sword duel very well; the waiting, positioning your sword for an advantage, looking for an opening to strike like lightning. I would know; I'm a fencer.The controls are quite simple, but there is a lot you can do with those six buttons. The tug-of-war mechanic is pretty clever, and adds a nice level of tension to the swordplay. If you screw up, your opponent could make a straight run to the end, virtually unopposed.The graphics are not impressive, but that should be obvious from the screenshots. The art style is interesting enough, if not terribly complex. However, the main focus of the game is the swordplay, so the visuals are not important in the slightest. in fact, something more realistic might actually detract from the experience.All in all, Nidhogg is a very good game. Definitely a solid 8 impalings out of 10. I personally think it's worth the $14.99. I've spent that much to see a two-hour movie, and this game can easily give me much more entertainment value for at least that long. Probably longer. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Nidhogg is what would happen if you took a fencing game, a tug-of-war game, and Towerfall and blended them all together. It's got the positioning and strategy of fencing, the back and forth momentum swings of tug-of-war, and the frenzied pace of Towerfall. Just like Ken Griffey Jr., it's a great game to check out if you and a friend want a quick laugh and to yell obscenities at each other while playing a fun game.The basic goal of Nidhogg is to get from one end of the screen to the other. There are always two players, yellow and orange. The yellow player wants to move to the right, and the orange player wants to move to the left. But in order to progress to the left or right, your player has to have control of the camera. The game will always begin in a neutral position. The camera is initially in a fixed position and camera control is rewarded to the first player who gets a kill. You can kill an opponent by stabbing them with your sword, throwing your sword at them, snapping their neck while they're knocked down, or by pushing your opponent into a stage hazard. As soon as you get control of the camera, you'll want to frantically run to the left or right, depending on which color player you are. But your opponent will be constantly respawning in your path to try and kill you, take control of the camera and push back in the opposite direction. Once you reach the end of the stage, you win, and are rewarded by being eaten by the giant flying worm known as the Nidhogg. Yeah.The pace of the game is very fast, and matches will usually last under a minute or two. Even though battles with your opponent happen very quickly, there's a little bit of rock-paper-scissors strategy with each encounter. You can approach traditionally with your sword, go in high for a divekick, or go in low and try to sweep the leg and snap the neck. There are also three fencing elevations you can hold your sword: low medium and high. Holding your sword low will protect against leg sweeps, but leave you open to divekicks and sword throws. Holding your sword high will protect against sword throws, but leave you open to leg sweeps. If you get disarmed or throw your sword, you will be able to run faster, but you will have fewer options. You can only attack with divekicks or leg sweeps, so often the best option is to just try to jump over your opponent. You can try to strategically analyze each of these options and try to predict what your opponent will do, but everything happens so quickly that you barely have time to think before one of you is already dead. You never really get a sense of negative punishment though, the quick respawning and fast pace of the game will only allow you to shout one quick profane phrase at your opponent before you're right back in the game to try again.The art style and music perfectly complement the gameplay of Nidhogg. There are four playable stages and each have frenetic and constantly changing background artwork. The artwork really serves to highlight the frantic and urgent pace of the gameplay. Same with the soundtrack. Most of the songs in the soundtrack have an eerie synthesized sound accompanied by an unpredictable and wild drum track. It really is the gameplay expressed through music. Each time a character dies, they explode into puddle of orange or yellow paint which flies all over the level at the point at which a character was killed. If you really get a deadlock where each player keeps pushing back and forth at the same position, you get a crazy looking orange and yellow bloodbath. It's pretty cool looking. The pixelated animations of the character models are great too. Some of the death animations are especially funny and they're accompanied by great over-exaggerated death screams. Great example of simple but awesome design in the audio/visualsNidhogg is an excellent example of a great game that will probably only ever get made in the indie space. The elevator pitch for this game is way too insane to be taken seriously by an executive and the scope of the game is too small for a large company to bother spending resources developing it. I'm really happy that there's a huge boom of really interesting and creative ideas coming from all of these amazing indie games like Nidhogg right now.Nidhogg is a weird, fast and crazy good time if you and a friend are looking for a game to play. There's even a bunch of crazy bonus setting like low gravity mode or hyper-speed mode you can toggle in the settings if you get tired of the basic game. The scope of Nidhogg is small, but the gameplay is good and the replay value is high. I'd recommend checking it out.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

The only problem is that it's hard to play with a keyboard and if you have a controller, you have a big advantage. $15 is a little steep, though. $10 would be a more reasonable price.			"

												a [good] game, that could've been [great], unfortunately due to a few minor issues I can't give it a 'full score'first we have the music; which in and by itself is great, [but] as I (and others) have experienced it causes a significant hit on the framerate, when enabled - disabling this makes the game run smooth howevermy main gripe though is that the game (at its current state), not unlike my ex, has severe control-issues; I am only able to assign buttons/directions to my Xbox360 controller and not my Mayflash Arcade-stick; in fact I am also [unable] to remove the control-bindings for the Xbox360 controller for either player, which means that when I play this 2-player on one screen and my friend uses the Xbox360 controller and I use the Mayflash Arcade-stick (via Xpadder) - his Xbox360 controls will also affect [my] character - this is more than just a nuasance, it is exceptionally bad desginapart from that, the game is fast-paced and fun - the single-player 'campaign' [can] be challenging, or at the very least as challenging as [you] make itobviously one could easily just outrun the A.I. and defeat the game in a very short time; but I do prefer to put up a fight and learn some new tricks along the waywith that in mind, however, it won't take the average player more than 30 minutes to complete itI have not, nor do I intend to try the On-line multiplayer, it's just not my cup of tea, so I can't speak for that partbut all in all, however, I do recommend this game, but keep in mind the controls and musichopefully these issues will be fixed in an upcoming patch			"

												I pray to the Nidhogg every night, thanking it for the life I'd been given.""Nidhogg is love,"" I say, ""Nidhogg is life.""I lay in bed and it's really cold.I feel a warmth moving towards me, it's the Nidhogg! I am so happy.It grabs me in it's jaws.I am ready, I spread myself on it's teeth as it begins to chew.It hurts so much but I do it for the Nidhogg.I can feel my chest cavity tearing as my eyes start to water.I push against its force, I want to please the Nidhogg.It screams like a majestic worm monster as it swallows me. The Nidhogg looks the crowd straight in the eye and says ""AAAaaaaAAAUuuuAAAA""The Nidhogg flies into the sunset.Nidhogg is love, Nidhogg is life. All hail the Nidhogg.			"

												Soundtrack by one my favourite musicians, Daedelus!  Worth getting for that alone. Some of the tracks are also on his soundcloud page: https://soundcloud.com/daedelusThe game is simple but suprisingly addictive. Would be great to play with friends...though, to do that I would have to first get another controller...and some friends.			"

												First of all, this game is not worth anywhere near a tenner. Absolutely not. There are four maps for god’s sake and one game type. That’s the entire game. It’s worth no more than five quid at best.Ok, so right off the bat, this game is fun. It is simple to understand, difficult to master, as all great games are, or should be. Playing with a friend is great, playing local multiplayer is even better. I have no quarrels with the game itself, what I have a problem with is how unplayably unfair it can be really randomly. I genuinely think this could be an esport if it had more depth and they fixed the broken AS ALL HELL  spawning system. The worst thing it does is when it spawns an enemy right in front of you as you’re walking and you just immediately die. This can loose you the single player tournament almost instantly and it’s infuriating. What really takes you out of the game is how outlandishly stupid the AI enemies are. Here is a prime example: you’re stood on a conveyor belt that is feeding into a pit from left to right. Your enemy is on the right of the conveyor and will fall in if he doesn’t move. You can guess where I’m going with this. They never move, they just fall. Any difficulty, any enemy, every time. Incredible. At higher levels, the best way to beat the game is to abuse this stupidity. Make the AI throw swords at ledges designed specifically to stop sword throwing (The only exception is the tunnel section of the mines level, AI rarely throw swords there.)What annoys me most  is that this could be an incredible game. Stupidly easy to understand and it’s really easy to tell if you’re at the same level as someone else. All the games play out like a tug-of-war and it’s just begging to be played competitively but it never will because it’s unfinished.All-in-all, I would recommend picking this game up when it’s on a good sale. Don’t pay more than half the RRP.Sidenote: Imagine if this game was f2p and it had hats. It would make millions in days.			"

												That's what hype does to games. Initially rave review, but later people found out that the game is not so great.The whole fencing system is clumsy, since relative control of the 3 epee positions with small visual distinction cannot be done with twitchy speed, and the animation is fast and bad, thus you can't really react to what the opponent does. On top of that, controller support is rather bad and color schemes awful which makes the game pain to look at. Bought on sale, but it still felt like an overpriced game.			"

												This game has changed the way I look at video games. It is the very thing that makes me a firm believer in the fact that video games are indeed an art form. Not Shadow of the Collosus or Ico, its all about the Nidhogg. If you have not played this game before, the story will suprise you. Although the motives of the characters are not immediately clear, a few matches in and an analysis of various motifs will reveal the true underlying themes. Of course although this is art, this is also a video game. The gameplay rivals the finest games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and last but not least Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two.Ill leave the rest of the game to you. Godspeed.			"

												Nidhogg is a great little game to play when you have friends over. It's fast paced and frantic, and it has that retro feel that I'm always partial to. This is the kind of game you could play with a group for hours. If you're by yourself, on the other hand, you might only be playing for half an hour. I was surprised to find that single player mode wasn't quite as dull as I expected, but it still gets repetitive much faster than playing against a human. My only real complaint is that the game only has four stages. That's technically all you need for a game as simple as this, to be fair, but a few more stage choices could help keep things interesting for longer.			"

The combat is simple to pick up, but has a lot of nuance.The tug-of-war system means that the objective is NOT to brutally murder your foe, but instead subdue or outwit them so you can get past them.I'd recommend not playing it without a friend.  The single player is a little frustrating, and there's a bit of a learning curve, so you'll wind up ahead of any friend you try to introduce to the game, and it can be frustrating to constantly lose.

												Nidhogg is a deeply tactical fighting game that's been distilled down to its very core. The simple graphics, distilled game mechanics and ultimately satisfying battles makes Nidhogg simple to pick up but incredibly difficult to master. The single player is a great introduction to the various tactics that you (and other players) can use, preparing you for the ultimate showdown with your opponent sitting right beside you. It might not draw me in as much as Soul Calibur did but it's a great fix for someone who's been aching for a decent fighter for a while.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/02/21/nidhogg-surprisingly-tactical/ "

												Fast paced combat, colorful visuals, and weird but surprisingly catchy music bundled up in an ultimately surreal package. Battles are intense bouts of skill, twitch, and a little bit of luck, making for a great experience in both online and offline multiplayer. The elements of the game that are actually game I cannot recommend enough.The biggest flaw in my opinion is the lack of content. A measley four maps make up your stage selection, and aside from a few entertaining variant modes (boomerang blades being my personal favorite), the gameplay is more or less static from match to match. A smaller issue is trying to share a keyboard when playing offline multiplayer where the game truly shines, but that shouldn't be a problem for anyone with a USB controller.In conclusion, Nidhogg is a strange little indie game that accomplished what it set out to do: be fun. It's definitely worth a look, and if you can enjoy the dreamlike graphics and sound, more than worth your time and money.			"

												Nidhogg is very good for several reasons.Usually I'm not a fan of having games with the whole atari 2600 theme due to the nature of so-called ""indie"" as a genre ruining retrostyling. nidhogg, however stands in the face of all that.the game revolves around you and your opponent fencing and fistfighting one another witht he ultimate goal of clearing the most screens to finally [s]be eaten by the Nidhogg[/s] be eaten by the Nidhogg. the gameplay is unbelivably fast paced, oriented around two player (or even more, if done in rotation) competition, has simple controls, isnt hard on your computer, and will make you have an incredible time playing.if you're a fan of an old school style game developed in modern day, nidhogg eats you.

Tournament should be Round Robin, so in order to win the pot you must defeat ALL other oppenents in a row.

												This is best played with friends I think.It is very fast paced, will murder you, the AI reactions are too fast, not enough maps, crappy soundtrack.But somehow, it works.Its a good game for people seeking a challenge, the single-player is brutal, and is more about outsmarting the enemy than being better than them.But certain parts of the AI does need patching up.Offline co-op is glorious, gloating and yelling at your friends is excellent.I think, why it is so fun, is the simplicity. No need to worry about charging your power attack, saving the world, killing an army of hostile pig people.Single player is a one time thing, but multiplayer is fun.			"

												This game.... dear lord this game.  I have a bad, bad history with fencing type arcade games.  Most of the time they were slow and clunky or just a part of a grander collection of olympic themed games, leaving them just another button masher like the rest.This is something else entirely.  It makes simple fun and parodoxically complex.  The limited moves make strategy fun.  Heck, even failure is a blast.  You can trell the make of a great game when you want to try again after a failure, but you have a great time while it happens.  In short, I have lost here and there, but I've never been frustrated by it.  A rare thing in a game indeed.From score to presentation to the weird way you ""win"", this game lives up to the hype.

												Good: This is a good game, in a fantastic and woefully underdeveloped genre (I'll call it the ""fast-paced shared-keyboard chaos"" genre)Bad: Despite how small the genre is, there are several games that dramatically outclass Nidhogg. Jump n Bump is fantastic that allows for 4 players and has similar pacing and enjoyability even with only 2. And it's free. Marshmallow duel is a 2 player duelling game with some incredibly tense standoffs. And it's free. See a pattern here? Both of those games I have well over 200 hours played and I'm sure to play hundreds more hours in future. Nidhogg? Well, I've played 2 hours and I might play 10 more.In summary: Nidhogg is a good game, but there are much better games available for free. I'd still recommend it, but only if you've already played the better (and again, FREE!) games in this genre and you really want something else. Or if there's a big price drop.			"

												 Nidhogg is a game that has been wowing the tournament crowds for a little while and now the rest of us get a chance to see what all the fuss is about. A one on one fencing the game, it is a pure test of skill against an opponent much in the same way Street Fighter or IK+ is. On the service Nidhogg is a simple game. You have to get your fencer to run across the level and reach your opponents end zone. Here you are eaten by the big worm Nidhogg thing and pronounced the winner. In order to do this you need to repeatedly best your enemy as you progress. Starting in the middle of the level you need to kill your opponent and run, after a short time your opponent will respawn and you fight again. If your opponent kills you they can then run the opposite direction in an attempt to regain ground.There are four levels to fight on which offer different environmental challenges and obstacles to use to your advantage. The castle has rooms and pits, so you can try and force your opponent to jump a pit and land on your sword or stay in a room so they can’t jump over you. The mine has a low ceiling which nullifies the ability to throw the sword or jump over your opponent, The clouds have disappearing ledges and the wilderness has platforms and long grass which allow for more manoeuvring and hiding.The only stage that doesn’t really work is the cloud stage as it’s just a bit much for your eyes to deal with; it’s also a bit dull compared to the others. The Wilderness reminded us of a 2D version of Bushido Blade which is certainly no bad thing at all.The fencer has a range of moves and techniques at their disposal. They can roll, cartwheel and jump which can be used to try and sneak past opponents if they have their sword at the wrong height. You can also perform a dive kick which knocks opponents over and makes them drop their sword. When an opponent is on the ground death can be dealt via a swift neck break. With the sword in hand you can thrust at three different heights. This works in a rock, paper, scissors kind of way and also defends against things like dive kicks depending on where you have the sword set. If you wish you can also throw your sword, however, if it’s parried you then leave yourself open to almost certain death.These basic moves form the crux of your sword fighting strategy and can be used in a number of different ways in order to best your opponent. If you are feeling super confident you can also disarm your opponent by moving your sword to the correct position at the exact right moment. Get this wrong though and you will find your own sword flying away.Essentially, this is a two player game and anyone going into it expecting a lengthy single player component will be disappointed. Single player acts as an arcade mode where you continually square off against computer controlled opponents on the games four levels. It’s practice for multiplayer and while a nice distraction it will only last you half an hour or so.The game uses a bright, 8-bit styled, colour palette to build its world. The colour scheme is garish but somehow seems to work. As a fencer is slain they explode into coloured dots and quickly begin to cover the arena in pixelated blood. It helps to highlight where the choke points are in each level as well as provide some visual flair.There’s no denying that Nidhogg is an excellent two player experience. It provides the same sort of adrenaline rush as all the best one on one fighting games and the mechanics work really well. However, we can’t help but feel that more could have been done here. There is certainly scope for a roaring Prince of Persia or Defender of the Crown style single player adventure. Even something like taking the Blood Valley (it’s an old, bad, 8 bit game), template and adding the superior gameplay of Nidhogg could work. Another option would be to have more stages. Having just four levels does make the package feel a little sparse. You could have had stages requiring some basic climbing or less footholds etc. Anyone who plays the game is going to have a great time and this is some of the best multiplayer action around at the minute. However, it could have been much more fleshed out in both single and multiplayer. The mechanics are great; we just hope there’s some further development of the other elements in the future as it could lead to something really special.Overall 7/10			"

												Nidhogg is one of those games that you really have to play to understand. You try to explain the game to somebody and you end up making it sound like a horrible game.It is anything but. Nidhogg is an adrenaline fueled rollercoaster ride with fencing, karate moves, one-hit KOs and most importantly, dive kicks.To even attempt to describe how hype this game is would be a crime. I purchased Nidhogg and my friends and I were playing it for two hours straight and yelling the entire time.A must purchase.			"

												Mother of god...this ""simple"" pixel based game that could be played with an NES controller with ease is actually incredibly deep. I picked this up after watching a youtuber play it briefly... again, mother of god...I used to play a hyper realistc fighting sim on playstation called Bashido Blade.. to me, this game is Bashido Blade reimagined on Atari. The one hit kill, fencing based combat combined with the push style arenas are absurdly intense. After playing the CPU about halfway through all the levels, all i could think of was calling up all my childhood fighting game rivals over to check out this new beast. The bumping beats and intense gameplay make this a helluva game for enthusiasts of intense melee combat.			"

It can be very fun if u play against a mate to fill in 10 minutes every now and than, like waiting for other friends to come online to play a game together. It really isn't worth it though sorry. Wait for it to go down in price, way, way down. It should only be $5 to start with anyway.			"

												Even though it's mechanics are simple and crude, Nidhogg displays the thrill of fencing better than most: wait for an opportunity to strike, look for weak spots in the enemy's defense and suddenly you spike him on a slender blade, tasting victory. Each victory brings you closer to winning, however it builds up your stress as the enemy may turn the table. Use every dirty trick to ensure victory: disarm, riposte, kick, sweep and throw your blade!The only negative point I can give to Nidhogg would be it's pricetag: € 13 is much considering the game has been 3 years in development and it has very limited content. Hooray for the Local Multiplayer though!			"

												you find yourself at the final stage. You throw your sword in an all out attempt to dispatch your enemy and advance, but he throws his as well. Now, both disarmed, you both stand still, neither side daring to make the first move. With victory within reach you run and roll into your opponent hoping to sweep and knock him down, leaving him vulnerable. It only takes a fraction of a second for them to figure out your plan and responds with a dicekick, knocking you down momentarily. A frantic balls to the wall fist fight ensues until you finally knock your friend down and rip their still beating heart from their chest cavity. You run to the next screen, a crowd of spectators cheer you on, as you are eaten by a dragon, this is victory.Nidhogg is one of those games you can sit down with your friends and play and just have a good time. Tension is the name of the game where twitch reflexes and cunning tactics reign supreme. Nidhogg is an incredibly tight and precise game where zero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t flies, and I think that's it's greatest strength. Knowing that you and your friend and playing on a completely level field where the skill of the player  dictates the outcome of the match. For $15, Nidhogg is in my opinion, a must own, if not for the good times to be shared with your friends, then to appreciate the excellent design. 10/10			"

												This game is fantastic. It brings back not just the nostalgia of playing heated matches with your friends on the couch, but also the pure skill and difficulty to truly master the game. This is not something that will give you instant gratification while holding your hand the whole way, like most games that are released nowadays seem to do, and yet anyone can pick it up and play it within minutes. It has to be said that those who bought this game expecting a single-player experience, or a game with a lot of combos and superficial depth, are going to be disappointed. Since the beginning of development, the game was, in my opinion, clearly focused on local multiplayer. This was meant to be a party game, or something that you and your friends could enjoy giving each other grief over on those late nights. I am pretty old school, and have gotten weary of the online matchmaking systems that most games implement - you just can't be certain you will be paired with someone that will make the game enjoyable for you. If you really want to have fun, you should be playing with your real friends anyways. And if that's your opinion on gaming as well, do yourself and your friends a favor - buy this game. It is absolutely worth it.			"

												It's good that Nidhogg has been able to make swordplay into an accessable game mechanic that allows the player to dictate their own strategy. And because of this, the game is constantly engaging, encouraging the player not to just wait for an oppourtunity to strike, but to make it happen by deciding on your movements and countering the opponent's.A lot of others have been mentioning the price; it might be a handful, but remember that you get pretty decent and challenging AI (Especially towards the end) and multiplayer in with it.

												I had the pleasure of watching the Game Grumps and Polaris play Nidhogg and I must say I was watching each tournament they had up from start to finish. Nidhogg is a fast paced game that can get intense when playing with friends. The controls are incredibly simple: Move, jump, and attack. However, what seems like a simple control scheme turns into a difficult tug-of-war between the two players. Parrying, diving, throwing your sword. There are many ways to win, and the player in the lead can suddenly get killed and be forced to catch up. Have a couple of controllers? Grab some friends and watch the fencing-antics!			"

I only recommend it if it's on sale. If this were a video store, I'd say it's a solid rental. If you want a game with fun saber combat that you'll get dozens of hours out of, I recommend Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.I also teabagged my friend then fell through some clouds and died, so there's that.
