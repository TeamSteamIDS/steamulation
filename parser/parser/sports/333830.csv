												FHM 2 is a HUGE improvement over the first effort...HUGE!I've played all of the EHM games and really enjoyed them but FHM 2  has so much more to offer at this point like expansion, historical and fictional game setups and very modern game interface.Mods are being made for the game and include league and team logos and some really outstanding hockey jerseys for the facegen players.The trading AI needs a little tweaking but what sport game ever gets that perfect.If you are a hockey fan you need this game, even if you aren't a hockey nut this game may very well turn you into one.This game gets a 9/10 .

												This game is awesome.  It fixes a lot of the problems from the first iteration.  The sim engine for watching games is stellar and the play by play adds a lot of excitement when watching your team in a big game.  Its still not perfect, I had some issues getting the screen resolution to work with my game but after playing around with it for a bit I was able to get it to fit.  I would give this game a 7/10, its a great hockey sim, it has a lot of depth, but there is still a lot of potential that is unrealized.* for anyone playing on mac and having trouble getting the game to fit the screen resolution you must hide your dock before opening the game otherwise the screen will not size itself correctly.*			"

												If you are looking for EHM's detailed leagues setup plus OOTP's amazingly flexible engine, do not buy this game. It is not what you are looking for.Both modes feed stunted when compared to their measuring sticks. Had the game been priced in the 20/29 $CAD region I would have been content with it. But I paid 33 buck for that and it was during a 25% sale. Which takes the game's pricepoint at 44$. On Par with OOTP. This game is nowhere near OOTP's state of completion and should not be priced as such.I really want to give this game a positive review, because i'm, I was, I don't know anymore, a big fan of it's developers. But I just can't swallow that pill.			"

												If you like simulating hockey this game is great. It has a deep game sim engine, and pretty decent options to customize the experience to your liking. Don't expect it to do everything, but it does what it says it will do quite well. If you bought FHM 2014 and are now on the fence about this game, I'd say give it a chance. It's drastically different from FHM 2014, and has no errors or issues so far.I have been waiting for this game for the last couple of months to come out. I have followed the build-up to the game's release quite closely, seeing what the beta testers and developers had to say about it, and it's expectations. I played FHM 2014, and was disappointed by it as many were, but the developers have done a wonderful job this time around. They have built a very solid game, and have not overstretched themselves by marketing something beyond what they said they would do. In fact, Sebastian, the lead developer on the project, has time and time again undersold the game on the game's forums, likely trying to temper expectations after the release of the last FHM title.But anyways, I haven't had any issues with this game yet, and the way it was so strenuously tested I don't anticipate having any major issues. I'm sure there are bugs here and there to be found, but it's definitely a solid release.They plan to release this game annually after this year, and it's likely if there aren't features you're looking for in this release, they'll be added in subsequent versions.But having played EHM:EA I can honestly say there's no alternative to FHM 2.10/10			"

												OOTP struggled for a long time with a terrible UI atop a great game, and now FHM suffers from the same problem. There's probably a good game here, but between a few random bugs (my team spontaneously hired a GM while I was playing in coach+GM mode, multiple crashes, stopped getting messages/news, etc.) and the pretty awful UI it's still a version or five away from realizing its potential as OOTP for hockey. When it does I'll definitely pick up a copy, but this effort definitely soured me on the idea of playing this or next year's version.			"

												Though far from perfect, Franchise Hockey Manager 2 may be perfect for you. It certainly was for me. Mind-bogglingly customisable, well-made and with excellent depth, this is a superb game and exactly what I was looking for. I like my sports games where I can rename my teams, fiddle with my logos, and play around with all the settings to get it just how I like it. This is superb. If you like hockey and are willing to spend a little time learning the ropes, this offers a lot.			"

												As a long-term management sim player, I wanted to like FHM2. But I can't recommend this.First, unless you have enough money to sign a full complement of players (which is an issue in smaller leagues), then it's impossible to set up your lines. You're unable to use a player on more than one line. The AI can do it. YOU can't.The game feels and runs slow. Sorting through lists of players takes a long time and I have a fairly good PC.FHM2 doesn't have basic UI functions that are in pretty much every game like this. You can't view all of the players in your league in one list.  You can't set up custom lists. You can't view detailed player attributes in the same screen where you set up your lines.Maybe this game is alright if you're only into Hockey (there are much better games for other sports) and just using the NHL, where you can afford more than enough players to fill your lines out and there aren't as many players in the world to slow the game down. I might load it up once in a while - it's not the worst game I've ever played. But it is just mediocre and a little unfinished, with that one really annoying line bug. I woudn't buy it knowing what I know now.			"

												I was playing as the GM of the Sabres and the team hired another GM at the same time and stopped me from making any trades. I had to go into Commish mode, resign and then take the job all over again. Then later in the same game the 2018 draft list never populated so in effect there was no draft. Puzzling			"

												I have put in over a hundred hours on OOTP Baseball 15, then 16 and also excitedly bought this game back when it came out in the original 2014 version (which sucked more). I love the Baseball sims by these guys but hate the hockey manager, this one is no exception.It is clear that their bread 'n butter is made off the baseball sim so they chuck this out there with little polish. I'm not sure why this gets a very positive rating, it's not all bad but it is flawed. For example, when I fired my assistant coach in my historical Leafs '46 league only to find the lowest salary replacement was $21K (8,000 more than Doug Harvey's salary) I knew it was a quick slap-up sim that is taking advantage of a void in hockey sims.Aww screw it, I gave them a chance since I loved the BBall sim, but now I'll focus on Eastside Hockey Manger instead, which is also on steam but has better reviews.

												There are a lot of wonderful things about FHM2. Unfortunately the wonderful things are outweighed by some unbelievably poorly thought-out flaws. You manage a hockey team. You draft and trade players to build up the team over time. Your effort is made futile by the AI very often taking spontaneous control of your trading and management of the team. It's very absurd. You make a chart of what positions you need to trade for to have a shot at the cup this year but - WHOA! The AI takes charge and trades for three mediocre defencemen! Sure you checked off that box saying you're in control of trades, setting the lines, etc., but that box does nothing. No problem: You're lucky and you saved the game recently. So all you have to do is spend an hour redoing the entry draft and then WHOA! the AI just traded away that goalie you've been developing for three years! Let's go back to your last save game and redo that entry draft again. And again. And again. The point of the game is developing a team over a number of seasons but, regardless of your performance, the AI constantly interferes. I've played five seasons of this Kafkaesque nightmare and I'm calling it quits. Outrageously poor design for a sports management game. Yes, I've played this game for 172 hours. Don't make my mistake.			"

												I have been a big fan of the developer for many years, buying their baseball game every year since 2002 and it looks certain that FHM2 is on the same tragectory of greatness for the great game of hockey. Anybody who has seen my videos knows that I am a historical gamer guy and so far I have started in 1931, put all the players in a draft pool, picked my team, played the pre-season and the first game of the regular season and everything has been flawless and fun. I picked some dude named Marty Barry in the third round and his nickname is Goal-a-Game Berry and he scored 10 goals in the pre-season and 2 goals in the first game of the year. Looks like I have my star...let's see how many goals he can get this year. The media experts have picked the Boston Bruins as the team to beat....I look forward to knocking them on their butts.If this sounds interesting to you, then grab the game now...You can start any year from 1931 to the present time or you can start your own fictional league based on your home region or some country on the other side of the planet.

												tl;dr - This game is for die-hard hockey fans only in its current state; everyone else should play OOTP15.Out of the Park Baseball is one of, if not the best management sim on the market, so when I found out the team behind it had made a hockey game, I was intrigued; when I saw it on sale, I had to give it a shot, hoping for the same kind of deep, rewarding, limitlessly customizable experience I got from their baseball sim.I've had a good time, and I'll most likely keep playing, but I haven't gotten that same experience.While the customization is there for leagues, teams, and players, it's not there for the AI like it is in OOTP, meaning players are stuck with some utterly ridiculous trade proposals from the computer offering spare parts for significantly better players and refusing to accept any deal that isn't painfully lopsided in its favor. Granted, I could play in Commissioner Mode, which would allow me to force trades through (just like OOTP), but it's the principle of the thing.The menu system also feels a generation behind that of OOTP. It's rather clunky and takes some getting used to. That's before players ever reach the bizarre game screen which makes all the information very difficult to digest, especially when the game is moving along at the normal speed of a hockey game or faster.Other than that, complaints are minor. Little things that get missed in some of the nuances of each league, which are irritating and, at some levels, even game-breaking. But, you know what? It's hockey. And if it's playable, I'm willing to overlook some of its flaws to get some enjoyment out of it. And, despite my complaints, I have enjoyed FHM2. Go Preds.			"

												As someone who really was excited to play the first FHM game and, despite its many flaws, still sunk in a ton of hours into playing it, I was ecstatic about the sequel for a long while. When I got invited to help beta test for it the past couple months on the forum to iron out bugs, I was even more excited. So don't let the low number of hours fool you, I've played the game a lot already prior to the release here on Steam.With that said I can safely say this game is leaps and bounds above what the first game was. If you had a bad experience with FHM 2014, don't let that sway you at all. This is like a whole different game in terms of how much was done to fix and chnage everything. Fictional mode (my preferred mode personally) is far more stable, as now it only will run your league and its affiliates, no background leagues to slow you down. The facegen really helps in making players stand out and come to life a little more, you can add in custom jerseys for the teams through mods along with logos and pictures, the new game engine is much improved as it takes into account different player roles to rate them better during games. On top of that you've got new tactics management and a generally better AI for lines and rosters.If you are a hockey fan or fan of the OOTP team as a whole, you will not be disappointed in this game. It is very worth the long wait it took, and having tested the game I've seen how hard they worked to make sure it was close to perfect at release. This is truly the game we had hoped for before.

												Terrific step up from the initial FHM offering. The UI is much more polished and user friendly than it was previously. Many parts of the game were re-built from the ground up and it shows. While I generally sim each game, my experience with the new match engine is very positive as well. There is lots of new detail to dig into and I'm still learning my way around the game. If you're a fan of sports sims, and especially hockey, this is definitely a good purchase. A massive improvement over FHM, and has even more room to grow in the future.			"

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:If you are a hockey fan, this is your game. The deepest hockey sim available. Not heavy on graphics at all, but HUGE on depth and stats. 5/5 and worth every penny.The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:Are you a hockey fan? Like, a real hockey fan? Don't waste anymore time. Just go now and get this game. If you are familiar with Out of the Park Baseball, then you'll know what to expect here. This is EASILY the deepest and most realistic hockey game/simulator you can find on the market. I have been playing OOTP Baseball games since they started making them. You can go back and simulate ANY season in the history of the sport. You can start play from the current season. You can have a fantasy draft and have your own NHL. My favorite? Fictional players. You can create a brand new hockey universe for your amusement. Set the level of depth YOU want. Coaches, scouting, international feeder leagues, the works. THIS is sports simulation at it's finest. Easily a 5/5 for any hockey fan. Worth every penny. Happy Gaming!!!			"

												These guys developed OOTP, they clearly know what it takes to make a fantastic simulation sports game. It's interesting then that they didn't. FHM2 is fine, has its moments, and will eat a couple of hours, but from the sluggish simulation speed, generally horrible UI, and a tendency to crash every ten games... Just don't. They're a couple iterations away from finding the sweet spot with FHM. Not worth your money.			"

												FHM2 is a massively improved game over the previous version of Franchise Hockey Manager. On the surface the game has improved visually with a great new UI. The addition of the Facegen also is a big positive in the overall presentation of the game. It is also very easy to add custom logos and jerseys improving the overall look of the game.The new game engine is another vast improvement over FHM2014 and makes the game experience more fun/enjoyable and immersive.One of the key new features I was looking forward to is the addition of the abiity to Expand the NHL in historical and modern day play. With expansion being talked about in the NHL at the moment this feature seemed quite prevalent and works well in the game.All the major systems in the game such as training, player development, scouting etc have been completely overhauled from FHM2014 giving players all the information they need to run their team and find/develop players.FHM2 is for me the best Hockey General Manager/Head Coach simulation available and with OOTP developments having a proven track record with OOTP Baseball FHM is only going to get better.

												ORIGINAL REVIEW:No where close to OOTP in terms of a good sim. Has a ton of potential but falls very flat in a lot of areas. Players are automatically released from my team instead of providing a warning that you can not advance without roster adjustments. Players are randomly traded from your team due to same issue above.These are just basic things that I do not feel should ever happen in my game. Unlike OOTP, i am not motivated to update to the next version. Someone let me know when this series improves and I will definitely return.UPDATE: After receiving the updates I noticed a dramatic change in the game play. Specifically with the above mentioned bugs. They no longer seem to occur and would like to thank the developers for being on top of this. With all of the fixes I would prefer to give this a thumbs in the middle. It has a ton of potential and since the guys behind OOTP are involved we should only see dramatic improvement going forward.			"

												It's a hockey sim. I don't know what else to say. It's not as polished at OOTP, but that makes sense when you consider how long OOTP has had to simmer. I think you'll find it almost easier to navigate if you've played some kind of sim game before. They are making improvements and so long as you desire to play in a more realistic universe, I find the game works a lot better than if you're interested in doing lots of fictional things. I think this is a buy if you're a fan of the genre. If you are not, you'll be better off just getting a console version of a hockey game and being done with it. But provided you like text-simulations and want a game where you can sim lots of seasons off the shelf, then FHM2 is a really big improvement over the initial version and it'll just get better since it's in the same stable as the best baseball game on the market. Just scale your expectations.			"

												This game will almost certainly go down in history as being defined by the multitude of bugs it has. From small annoying things like menus that go right off the screen so you cannot access them to spelling and grammar mistakes in news items. Then there are the larger issues like AI that just cannot get anything right to the rating system where even a very average player is rated ""3.5"" stars out of 5 (one would think average would be 2.5? But I digress).It is a small step up from version 1 but some way off from a good sports simulation/management game. More attention to detail is required in order to make this a successful franchise game in the future.			"

												Franchise Hockey Manager 2 made by Out Of The Park Baseball Developments, is a much better and clean game to its first game Franchise Hockey Manager 2014. While saying that, there are still some problems with this game, but not major ones and not as close to as bad as to FHM 2014's probelms. OK, lets start off with the positives of this game. FHM 2 now has a completely new engine that looks almost exactly like the one in OOTP16, which gives it a lot of points in my book. Another positive that it has with me is that it is easy to find your team and the farm teams with the new menu's, it saves time and it also saves probelms that you might have. The trades, OMG the trades, they are so much better in this game, and it now rivals OOTP16 trading system, it is that good. There are also expansions that you can do at the end of a season, if you would like, that makes the game feel fresher and more lively. With all of the pluses, there are some negitives that i must tell you, The major one i see so far, is the loading, it can take a long time if you even click on the home screen, i mean its not to long, but it is a wait. Another thing that i hoped got fixed but did not was the games, i really hoped for a new game screen for the games, but that didnt happen, it still looks boring and the screens can make it confusing. But other than that i really dont see anything totally wrong with this game. Overall, FHM2 is getting better, i mean a lot better, its getting up there towards OOTP, but its still years away from itI give this game a overall score of 8.25/10 and would recommend it to hardcore hockey fans to buy it now, but causal hockey fans to wait till a sale.FHM2 is a much more improved game than FHM2014, but it is still no where close to OOTP			"

												Gunna be honest from the front, REALLY did not like FHM 1, but if you are in the market for a GM game, specifically for hockey, do not let that turn you away.Look no further than franchise hockey manager 2. It is vastly improved from the last game, you can tell they have put a lot of work and care, to making it better than before and it is debatably even better than Eastside hockey manager at this point . Trades have been normalized and player progression is normal and fun to watch young draftees climb the slots. Statistics are pretty realistic and standings are fun to watch as you play through the years, randomized draft pools make you plan your future...  Do you want to go for the position you need? Or go for the player the best in the draft? Honestly at this point the only complaint I have is one I can't seem to get the real NHL logos in the game no matter what I do (Yes I used the forums). And number two it is kind of annoying to see player potential displays right from the start,  it helps a ton with understanding where players will be in the future but so far I have yet to see any diamonds in the rough of young guys with low potential that come out and do good so it kind of takes away from the unknowingness of young prospects you kind of always know who is going to be good or not and draft bust's are rare. Other than that great game! I have already uninstalled seaside hockey manager as I have no need for it now and I will continue to sync hundreds of hours into franchise hockey manager. From someone who hated number one as much as everybody else I give this a recommendation completely and honestly. Franchise hockey manager to the huge step up from this predecessor and I am honored to give it a 9 out of 10.			"

												The first FHM was full of interesting ideas but, frankly, unplayable. FHM2 is full of interesting ideas and is eating evenings out of my life. It still needs some polish, and patches are coming regularly, but the game plays very well indeed. Customisability and easy editing put it ahead of the competition. Well worth full price.			"

												I'm really enjoying the game thus far, and I cannot wait until our online league gets underway! I'm a long-time supporter of OOTP Developments, and while the game is different than OOTP, consider that a good thing as it has its own flavor. I did not play the first FHM, but you can clearly see there's a strong foundation with a GREAT simulation engine that needs really just one minor tweak to goalie save %...which may be coming as soon as tomorrow's patch.If you're into sport sims, you'll definitely get your enjoyment from this game. Use the community to your advantage for mods, etc. and you'll find it's well worth the sale price going on right now! Get it before Monday!			"

												Great hocky management sim. From the NHL, WHL to the Liiga, it has all of the real leagues and players. Tons of depth whether you want to tackle the GM side or the role of Head Coach this pretty much has you covered. From building a Championship powerhouse in a few years, to losing your star players right before playoffs, this title generates a lot of fun and stories to be shared.			"

												- FHM 2 is Leaps and Bounds better, than its predecessor.- Take over as GM and make the moves you only hoped, your favourite teams GM, would make.- Modern, Historical, and Fictional give you tonnes of options for replayability.- Lots of stats and transaction logs.- Fair amount of customization.Definitely recommend, to any who enjoy sports text sims, especially hockey.

												The interface is a pain to go through. No way to shop players and no feedback from other teams when you offer trades. All you get as an answer is ""NO WAY!"".The game feels like it's unfinished or has been made by people that are not hockey fans. And for the price, you should get more, considering there are other options in the genre that are much cheaper and at least admit the fact that they are an ""Early Access"" and not ready for release.I certainly hope there is a lot more development coming, because so far this game is extremely disapointing,			"

												First thing I notice is that the UI is far from where I would expect it to be after being an avid player of OOTP Baseball, which normally wouldnt bother me, but having played a game made by this studio and seeing the UI (in a very similar game) done so much better in that product just is disappointing. Beyond that everything seems to play much like OOTP baseball which is nice, just seems like theres quite a bit of fine tuning			"

												FHM 2 is a fine (hockey) management game. Devs have made significant progress from previous iteration FHM 2014. In Steam there are already a few good in depth reviews (with pros and cons). FHM 2 needs  of course development to progress even better game but first day / release version of the game is already a must buy for any management game or hockey fan.			"

												This game is not ready for primetime. OOTP baseball is a masterpiece, and I mean that sincerely. You can tell that the same dediciation to providing the player with an immersive simulation is present in this game but it is still far too buggy. It crashes often, especially when you want to run a historical expansive team (e.g., the San Jose Sharks). Simple things like conducting searches with filters that yield players with certain attributes (e.g., hockey sense > 13) are still missing.I would wait until the next version comes out.			"

												It's essentially Out of the Park Baseball but with Hockey, which is what I was hoping for. Really enjoying it so far. It seems to simulate hockey great, I genuinely feel like I effect my team {mainly badly so atm :)} and it's been fun so far. I also must give them credit for adding tooltips to the stats, as someone without a lot of knowledge about Ice Hockey it has made grasping whats going on with my players a LOT quicker and easier. It was a feature I wished OOTP had, very glad they added it here :). Only have 2 complaints about the game. The major one is the interface, it's just more awkward than OOTPB, it's workable but it can be frustrating if you're used to their Baseball games. The second isn't that big of a deal but the match interface is a little boring. Neither detracts massively from the game. Also not a complaint exactly but I wish I could just manually add jerseys and logos like you can in OOTP. On the whole really like the game.			"

												Let me start off by saying I really like this game. It's definitely a jump from the previous edition (I refunded, so I'm sorry to the developers). But they have really stepped it up so far this season. I've played countless hours on it, have restarted and started several other simulations and got fired. (I screwed up a bunch of times).The GM Experience is nice, they've finally added head coaching so you can do the ""Front Office"" for yourself, or if you'd like, you can GM + Head Coach. The simulation experience is quite realistic and the AI is a lot better than what it was before, such as the AI not picking up some really good prospects in the Free Agency.I also like the scouting, where I can scout certain areas where maybe the AI has not picked up. In the draft, I was able to select a potential player in the 4th round, since the AI didn't scout around that area. The scouting can be improved as well, since I feel that if you've scouted your team, your players and the draft, most of them should be accurately scouted, not E almost all the time.The alternative of this game is to go to EHM:EA, but I'm starting to like FHM 2 because of their efforts they've put into compared to what EHM has done. I haven't played EHM as much as I would like to (I refunded the game), but for what its worth, I think FHM has the potential to be greater as shown by the number of improvements they have made from the previous edition.I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes to handle the General Manager position or Head-Coaching Position. It is definitely a fun game to play.			"

												Everything written here is soly based on my opinion:It all began many moons ago with the freeware version of what we all know of Eastside Hockey Manager. I played that game to enternal hell, why not ?? It was the best simulation in the world at that time! Risto ""Riz"" Remes was the godfather of this era and his accomplishment for the product years later gave him an opportunity to join up with SEGA Sports Interactive to produce Eastside Hockey Manager. Who wasn't happy about this at the time ? I mean C'mon... the amount of potential the game had now with a brand like Sega backing them was endless and a dream come true to fans all over the world.Well... after a few versions, bad advertisment, absolutley no additional features, a few years later because of they're pi$$ poor excuse of ""pirating"", the game was.. cancelled... yes folks... SEGA.. who had this golden apple in front of them for years and years, no to mention the hardcore fans all over the globe frothing for more were told .. thats it! Now.. years later with SEGA not willing to produce anything other than a tight leech for updating EHM:EA as a side gig for the small clan of hockey gurus they have working for them, because of well... lets face it... costs!! thats right folks... money.. greenbacks... the risk versus reward wasn't in Sega's scope anymore to fix they're mistake of product advertisments, basically starting again and taking that golden apple from the tree.Here we are today... Enter OOTP FHM2. OOTP isn't about money... they arn't about how many units they sell to cover the costs of they're managers paying for those BMW's, fancy suits and all that corprate bullcrap, they are out to deliver the best simulation product they can muster up and then some. FHM isn't going away no.. they are here to stay. I don't expect everyone to have the same point of view to all this but over the years of frustration and looking for a hockey simulation fix, Out of the Parks FHM2 is now officially the best of the best at this moment and with a dedicated, motivated, drop the gloves group of developers looking to deliver to the hockey world without the bullcrap excuse's of the later mentioned, I'm also here to stay. Congratulations on an outstanding product and you have my vote of confidence!			"

												Definitely an improvement over the first edition.  Cleaner, more customizable, deeper historical play.

												Pros - Depth, pretty well laid outCons - Changes lines randomly(I have it set up so that I manage all the lines), changes lines badly(my secondary minor league team has only one real prospect, I put him on 1st line, turn my back for a second and he is on the 4th line...have to give more time to guys who aren't as good now and have no potential to get better......also taking an offensive d-man and randomly moving his playing time up and giving him 1st unit PK time while dropping his PP time), and free agent status is messed up in some cases(I have a guy I would be looking to trade late in my first season, he will be a RFA after the season, but the game has made him an UFA, lowering his trade value). Also, trading still needs some work to get up to the level of OOTPOnly 6 hours in, and I am already sick or having to change my lines after every few games, it is taking away from much from the enjoyability of the game. I never played the first one, have gathered this was a great improvement.....but there is still a long way to goUpdate - This game makes my head hurt. Seriously. It keeps changing my lines around, and then I see that the game has changed my settings(which believe me, I took great care to ensure the settings were how I wanted them and then saved). So, check your settings at the start of every season, no matter how many times you have set them and saved them....it is too late for me, but maybe I can save someone else smacking themselves in the head in frustration, which I will do many more times before I can make the Leafs a cup winnerOne more issue, and it is a big one. I have a drafted player who I have signed to an entry-level contract, but I wish to return to junior. However, his team already had the maximum of foreign import players, so I can't send him to junior. He is too young to assign to minor pro, so the only choices I have are to buy out the contract and release a 19 year old first round pick, trade him, or keep him on the NHL roster, which I don't want to do because he won't play regularly barring injury. This needs to be changed so that the junior team accepts his rights back, and is then able to trade him or another player in order to get back to their limit.			"

												I am really disapoited with this game, especially after paying $30. I've played Football Manager and OOTP for years and this comes nowhere close to that. The screen's are ""pretty"" but utterly unusable. For example, you can't easily move players up and down the layers of your organization, there are no way or filtering your current roster by position (which makes it really hard to know what you need) and altogether not enough data is shown about your team to really understand where you stand. This ""unfinished"" feeling is compiled by random bugs (can't submit offer sheets half the time), unstyled block of HTML in text paragraphs and slow performance. Maybe FHM3 will be better but this version is definitely not worth buying.			"

												Franchise Hockey Manager 2 is probably one of your better options for a hockey management game. While Eastside Hockey Manager is the less costly option, FHM 2 is a more polished product as of Christmas 2015 while EHM is still being developed.Pros:The UI is clean and straightforward.Team names and players names are all accurate and included in the game without installation of a mod pack.Cons:Some scoring in the game is outlandish (with many high scoring blowouts for weaker teams or even good teams in general. You'd choose to start with a solid team like Tampa Bay on it and would steam roll to playoffs but would still have losses with a score line of 6-1 or 5-0.)I didn't have much else to say since it's a very straightforward game.

												At the top I just want to say that I got this as part of a package on the Steam Summer Sale so it cost me much less than it would normally sell for.I don't have any of the problems and bugs I've been reading in the reviews.  Haven't had the game crash on me once.  I'm having a blast with this game.  The UI is a little janky and unintuitive.  Advancing days or weeks or months is very slow considering the hardware I am running on.  But this is the best hockey simulator I have played.  If you like OOTP and are a hockey fan, then you'll probably love this.  It's definitely not as polished as OOTP but the glorious roster management and simulation is all there.  It's just that getting around takes some getting used to.  And you'll have to remember to check on things every so often.  This game doesn't hold your hand and requires you to pay attention to detail and be deliberate about checking all the little things to be truly successful. So far the simulation has been very realistic.  No crazy high or low production from any players without a reason.  If you see a player playing over his head or struggling for extended periods of time it usually makes sense and is correctable by altering the personel around him or tactics of his line.  I don't know if this is actual logic that has been implemented in the game, but the trades I've attempted with traditional division rivals have required me to give up much more than what I would consider fair in order to get the trade to go through.  Now maybe that's just luck or me seeing something that isn't there but there are many details like that which appear throughout my playtime that make me feel like the developers put a lot of thought into simulating the hockey world in this game.I very rarely ""play"" a game (watching a simulation of a game with certain mangerial decisions allowed) in these team management type of games but I really enjoy jumping into a game with FHM 2.  I've only jumped into a couple and there is very little interaction outside of changing tactics for you lines according to game flow.  But!  Using the User Advance option which lets you advance the game play by play is like following a real hockey game online or over the radio.    The play by play conveys the same feeling of nervousness that you get from a real radio or online broadcast.  And it actually gives you a really good feel of how the game is going and lets you evaluate players outside of their boxscore line.  I've only jumped in for a playoff series but I'm planning on doing it more often to use it to evaluate the play of players whose worth doesn't necessarily show up in a boxscore.Basically if you are an OOTP fan and hockey fan you'll really enjoy this game.  It rewards attention to detail and deliberate planning.  If you enjoy the Franchise Mode of the EA Sports NHL games but find it too simplistic or unrealistic I would say give this game a try as well.  Just take the time to learn the interface and  pay attention to everything you are responsible for as the GM/Manager of a team.			"

												Become GM of Buffalo Sabres----> acquire Holtby, Skinner, Kreider, Vatanen and Josi---> Get rid of Kane, Lehner, Pysyk and Foligno---> See Eichel, Reinhart and Ristolainen develop nicely----> win Stanley Cup at the end of the second season----> Acquire Auston Matthews for future---> have no decent draft picks left, but who needs them for a while with a team like this?10/10			"

												I get the chance to right the wrong of ,what I call the most egregious trade in the history of Buffalo,New York pro sports,the trade that sent Pierre Turgeon to the Islanders in exchange for Pat ""Cry Baby"" LaFontaine...Come on back,Pat.We're waiting for you.Trust me...there will be updates.

												As a Hockey Sim fanatic since the IBM XT days, I've played pretty much every version of Eastside Hockey Manager since the early 90's, so I feel I am in a good position to comment on FHM2.  I never tried the first iteration of FHM, but if this is an ""improvement"",  it must have been truly terrible indeed.   I'll spare everyone the details, but in my opinion, FHM2 is not good either.    I REALLY wanted to like this game, but sadly it pales in comparison to EHM and I regret my purchase.  My impression of FHM2 is not helped by the fact that (1) this game crashes on me each and every time I play it and (2) it is nearly double the price of EHM. Trust me.  Stick with EHM!			"

												RIP OFF!!!!! FULL OF BUGS . NOT WORTH THE PRICE TAG $$$. WOULDNT BUY THIS GAME AGAIN IF IT WAS A DOLLAR WOULD HAVE TRIED TO GET A REFUND BUT THIS GAME RUNS SO SLOW I WENT OVER THE 2 HOUR LIMIT BEFORE I FINISHED MY FIRST SEASON , NO MUSIC? A VERY VERY BORING GAME IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT (A GAME)  YOU WILL HAVE MORE FUN AT THE DENTIST. I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING MORE LIKE GM MODE ON NHL 16 (WITH SIMMED GAMES OF COURSE)  BUT WHAT I GOT WAS A GIANT WASTE OF TIME . DEVELOPERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED !!! THIS IS A POOR EXCUSE FOR A GAME THAT MAKES ME SICK !!       DON'T BUY THIS IT IS TRULY CRAP !!! MAYBE THE DEV'S SHOULD HIRE SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT A GAME LIKE THIS SHOULD BE LIKE  0/5 , 0/10  I DONT THINK IVE EVER BEEN SO DISAPOINTED IN A VIDEO GAME			"

												I have to as well say that I am not very impressed as well simply because when you play in commissioner mode you don't have complete control over the league like changing ticket prices and chsnging team owner's name you should have total control when your in commissioner mode. The other bad thing is the expansion It's terrible you should be able to expand more then up to 36 teams and I cannot give this game a positive review unless the developers make some changes to the game. It's better but still not quite there yet. The other issue is you can create new players but not coaches and to me that's terrible. Why have an editor If you can only add players but not coaches that's stupid. I have stopped playing this game until the developers decide to wise up and make the game better.			"

												They updated the game to stop crashing but now it just opens up an unclosable window that shows nothing. This game is full of bugs and I have not been able to play it for a week. Do not recommend at all, go buy Eastside Hockey Manager			"

												I was very excited to try the new Franchise Hockey Manager (current user of the 2014 version, which while missing alot, was still enjoyable).  I am now 53 minutes into owning the game and have yet to play it.  I have tried to: create a fictional league (want the fanasty draft) - crashed, create a new league (whated to play it, you know) - reverted to main screen, will not load past, tried to create a new fictional league (give it another try) - waiting for the create events...Sigh, was very excited.  Will invest a couple of hours to try to get it to work, otherwise will ask for a refund and move on.			"

												Not much choise in Hockey Manager games, so I think this is ok, though I found it to be a bit too easy. I mean in the end I didn't do any changes to my team or tactics and kept on winning.			"

												It's a decent effort, but I wish the UI was more like the UI in OOTP Baseball.  The ability to resize the window is the most notable piece that's missing.The game engine runs slower than the Baseball game.One BIG missing feature is a setting for 'game start percentage' for Goalies.  Right now, if you manage your lineups yourself, the 2nd string goalie will never start - at least not that I've seen.  I'm sorry, but I'm not going to micromanage my goalies by flip-flopping which one is 1st string every couple of games.But, FHM is definitely worth checking out, there's a lot they got right. "

All I can say is so far I'm really enjoying this game.I created an International Hockey League with 30 teams from around the world and found unique logo's through google searches and used them for my fantasy teams I created for the league. It was pretty simple to do and it makes the game a lot more fun instead of using the weird generic logo's that come with the game. If you go to OOTP website they will explain how you can go about adding your own custom imagery. It does help to know how to use Photoshop or Gimp to get the image size right and make some changes to the logo's you find. I got creative with a lot of them...I then spent time creating a custom roster of people I used to play hockey with when I was kid growing up. Once I was done creating players I went ahead with the initial draft for league. I started of managing 2 teams and made the playoffs with both but was eliminated in the first round. Second season my teams performed better in the playoffs but still no championship.Using the commissioner mode make things really fun. I did my first expansion and added two new teams to the league. I read somewhere in forums that you can only expand to 36 teams but I hope this is not the case as I would love to continue to create new teams for the league. Overall I’m really satisfied after having paid only $9.99 for the game and OOTP has made me a fan of their content. I’m hoping that they release an American Football game as they seem to bring a certain quality to these types of sports simulators. I’ve played Front Office Football 7 and while I did have fun I feel like OOTP would do a much better job. I like FHM 2 a lot more than FF7. I think my next purchase will be OOTP 17 and I’m not even a baseball fan.If anyone is interested in the logos I collected and edited for this game message me. "

												Great game until I get 10 years in to a historical sim.  Then it will not advance to the next day without crashing.  Tried 3 different set ups and still get the same result.  Pretty sad.  Good review while it plays, Bad review for progressing over 10 years.			"
