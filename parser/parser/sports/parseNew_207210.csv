												In regards to the negative reviews:If this is not the way that you remember the original three Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, with bad physics and all, then please tell me what games you were playing and remembering. If this HD remaster has ""ruined"" your childhood memories so much, please point me in the direction of what Tony Hawk games you were playing as children.I was quite wary of this HD remake, considering the negative reviews on Steam. Users claiming that this game is nothing but a failure with bad physics and sloppy game design. This game is exactly how I remember the original THPS franchise (with better graphics and some slight variations obviously), and I put a LOT of hours into those games in my teen years.The controls are still weird and slightly hard to master, it's still difficult to tell if you're going to land something when you transition from a quarter pipe to the ground, and the newly implemented manuals (they weren't in the original THPS) still some times drop your combo instead of maintaining it.Yes, THPS was a crappy game in the early 2000's and it's still a crappy game now, even with HD textures, new skaters, different advertisements and all. It hasn't aged well by any means. When it was first released, it was the first of its kind, so we thought it was amazing, but since then a plethora of skating games have come out. But you know what? THPS is one of the best crappiest games I've ever played, and I have extremely fond memories of it when I was growing up. This HD remake simply updates the graphics, and it seems like people are mad that it's not a complete revamp of the game to bring it into the current control standards. For those of us who ACTUALLY remember the game, instead of just claiming that we do, this is an accurate and fun as hell re-release.Rating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing. "

												I am a person who LOVES Tony Hawk games. I've played and beaten every single one, (Save Ride & Project 8, but do those really count?) so I was super stoked to try this one out. this was not made clear to me, so I'm going to bold this out for people;THIS IS NOT A PORT OR GRAPHICAL UPDATE, IT IS A NEW ENGINE WITH THE SAME MAPSwhy is this such a big deal? It feels different. For someone who spent 100's of hours with THPS 1 & 2 this is a huge deal. It just doesn't play the same, and that breaks it for me. There are just so many things wrong with this game.-only single player available-no re-mapping controls-the only graphics option is to change your resolution-they've taken out the option to skip ♥♥♥♥♥♥ songs (why?) & They've added a lot of new ones that suck.-They've taken out the park editor from thps2-I run into physics glitches all the timeA port or re-release of the original games even with no HD update would have been 900X better than this, this is a poorly made, rushed-feeling wanna be remake of a classic that deserves better.What DO I recommend? Buy or download one of the official tony hawk PC releases, or buy a Dreamcast of Craigslist and google how to burn the games yourself.			"

												The Tony Hawk series was once one of thé sports titles to look out for every year. However, after the seventh installement, the series went in idiotic directions with a pack-in skateboard that was worse than the Wii Balance Board. After 2 failed games that were playable with that board, Activision decided it was best to go back to the roots of the series. Remaking some of the levels of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and packaging them together as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD. The idea is great, but they screwed it up.The controls suck. I tried to play this game with a keyboard and with a controller, but both times the game did not feel as smooth as the originals did. There are a lot of glitches and the graphics are horrible. I also wondered why they didn't just remake every level instead of just a few. This PC-port is the worst. You cannot change the keyboard controls, there are no video options to speak of, the resolution is not even Full HD and there is NO Multiplayer... really?? I grabbed the old Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 box for PC from my shelf and that version had Online Multiplayer... that was 1999. If you're curious about the Tony Hawk series or you're a fan.. in either case, stay away.			"

												In a day before games kept track of hours played, I'd estimate my time spent across the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) series in the 1000s of hours.  I fully completed and became proficient at games 1-8 in the series.  At the time, I thought 8 (the first entry on the PS3) was so poor that I couldn't bring myself to suffer through 9.  And then I played this disaster, which makes the constant issues/glitches in 8 feel like I was complaining about nothing.Let's cut right to the chase.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is not the same game as the old THPS games.  The game was rebuilt from the ground up and does not feel like the old series.  While the PS2 iterations became progressively less inspired and lazy as the numbers climbed to 5, 6, 7, at least the game always FELT the same.  This feels totally different and the best way I can describe it is clunky.  I made an effort to max Tony Hawk's stats because I thought ""maybe it feels like garbage because my stats are so low.""  I got close, but could not bring myself to finish the task.  It was too frustrating.Controls: there is no way to change them in-game and with a controller, they are slightly different than the old THPS games (see ""reverts"")Reverts: This essential move, added in THPS3, is available via a DLC pack.  Okay, yes, it's stupid that it wasn't included in the original, but whatever.  That is not the main issue here.  Fans of the old games will remember that a revert is performed by pressing R2 as you land a vert trick.  The previously mentioned control change?  Now R2  also causes your skater to spin while in the air (I believe R1 did this in the past?  never used it).  Imagine this: every time you try to revert, you spin another 30-45 degrees, causing you to crash-land your vert trick.  It is difficult for me to put into words how frustrating this is.  And it happens CONSTANTLY.  How the developers could possibly think it's a good idea to have revert and mid-air rotate mapped to the same button is beyond me.  This issue alone makes the game unplayable.  There is a somewhat confusing .ini file you can edit to change key bindings, but as far as I can tell, revert and spin actions are one in the same, and cannot be separated.Grinds: In the THPS series, performing a grind/series of grinds speeds up your character.  This mechanic is not present here.  I used to trick around the map to collect objectives because it was faster, and fun.  In THPS HD, I found myself skating and avoiding everything because it slowed me down and I would inevitably run into some glitch that knocked me down.Wall-rides: God... the frustration.  They are damn near impossible to do in this game.  Way harder than in THPS1 (which was not a great game for wall-rides).  I nearly heaved my PC out the window attempting to grind the 5 bells in the schoolyard.  Oh, and when you actually manage to get in a wall-ride, the result is inconsistent and wonky.Display: All controls displayed in the game are keyboard controls, even if you're using a controller.  So navigating menus and buying stats required either guesswork on the controller or reaching over to use the keybaord.  Not a huge issue, but it's sloppy.Constant Glitches: I only played the game a couple hours and encountered tons of issues.  I'd estimate about 5% of my falls would launch me high in the air and across the map.  Manuals after reverts do not work consistently.  One time I was stuck in a manual and could not get out by jumping.If you've never played any of the old games, there is a chance you may enjoy this title, not knowing what you missed.  If you have played and enjoyed any of the previous iterations, stay far away, not matter how low the cost of this during a Steam sale.  It is like paying money to have someone punch you in the stomach and trample your dreams of a time when THPS games were fun.0/10			"

												Faithful to a fault, and doesn't live up to the potential this could've had.  I'm only an hour in, but I'm confident that's an accurate portrayal of the game.This (with it's DLC) feels more or less like a mish-mash of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, 2 and 3 with HD graphics.  If they had taken everything from these games and thrown it into one amazing release, it probably would've done better critically.  Instead they hand picked certain levels, hand picked certain skaters, lost a good chunk of the original soundtracks (mostly due to licensing issues), ditched the multiplayer found in the originals (local or online), ditched any kind of create-a-skater and called it a day.  It doesn't feel like the ""complete"" collection it could've been.  Like a greatest hits collection from a band that doesn't include all of their biggest songs, it's not really a game that needs to be in every THPS fans collection.Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the game is bad.  Lacking graphical options (outside of resolution) and wonky ragdolling aside, it plays exactly like a faithful HD rerelease should.  If you loved the games back in the PS1/N64 days, this will absolutely give you the THPS fix you've probably been craving.  (If you didn't or have ""grown up"" since then, it'll probably seem overly simple and dated.)  The game was always meant to be simple though.  Simple, but completely over the top... it's by no stretch of the imagination a juggernaut in modern physics.  You grind things you have no business grinding, you'll jump gaps that would put the Springfield Gorge to shame... but that was the fun of it... and it still is fun.  You'll still spend hours collecting SKATE, hidden tapes (DVD's), busting up bells around School II, making your way down the Downhill Jam.  Getting high, pro and sick scores.  And all the little challenges nested into each level, that you'll have to explore and find... unless, of course, you still remember where everything is.If you can find it for a good price and wouldn't mind a quick nostalgic shot in the arm, I'd definitely say give it a shot.  Just know that it's not the ""complete collection"" that it could've been.			"

												Horrendously buggy, awful physics and lacking in the charm that Tony Hawks' games used to always deliver on. Feels more like a tech demo 'what if' than a full release game, but I guess the only thing in its favour is the low price.I bought this for nostalgia, but all I found was despair.			"

												The physics are glitchy and broken, you don't even need to buy the THPS3 Revert pack to get revert since its now implented in the game completely. That means in the revert pack, you're basically paying 5$ for a few THPS3 levels. Coming from a THPS veteran, I would say this game is mediocre and not worth your time. Maybe for some laughs, but the Unreal engine is the wrong engine for this game. RIP Neversoft.EDIT: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is bad as well. Thanks for killing the series RobomodoEdit2: Still playing it even though its bad, yeah			"

You can change resolution and sound volume. This is not a potatobox360, this is PC. This is unforgiveable.- Added only ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music, and you can't skip them.+ Original songs also included.

												Man, wasn't this game a massive disappointment. As someone who loves THPS 2-4, this game was a huge letdown. First of all, the controls are absolutely trash, and you CANNOT rebind them. They really should have just stuck to the THPS2 controls, as those felt absolutely fine, but here trying to do tricks just comes off as awkward. Second, they add some of the worst maps from THPS 1 & 2 (Mall, Downhill Jam, Venice Beach mainly). Third, reverts came in a DLC, which is unforgivable. Reverts are what made vert viable for combos past just ending them. Not adding them makes grab tricks almost useless. all of this, and the game doesn't even look that good, it looks like it could have been made 2007-2008. Dont bother with THPS HD, it's not very good, and will only make you want to play the originals. It feels as if little time and effort went into this reboot which could have been great had it just been a new THPS game that returned to it's roots of fun, satisfying arcade styled gameplay. 4/10			"

												They updated the graphics but downgraded the gameplay. The original THPS2 gameplay felt way better than this HD remakes gameplay. E.g. they somehow couldn't get proper nollie flips done. Basically you do a nollie but then the flip animation is the one of a regular flip trick. Although I undestand that this issue isn't noticable or bothering for many players, to me it is a major flaw. Especially if you consider that THPS2 already did its flip trick animations perfectly fine 12 years before this remake was made. I would choose playing the old graphics with the old gameplay of THPS2 over the ones of the remake any time.Summarizing my experience with THPS HD, I can't say it was worth the time. To me it is nothing but a pretty lazy remake and an even lazier try to cash in on the good name of the old THPS titles.			"

An old popular skateboarding game got a remake recently, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD. Negatively received in countless sites is it really disappointing? Read on to find out!Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD is a skateboarding game developed by Robomodo. This game takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience for the PC.You probably remember playing this masterpiece with your friends overnight just to hit that perfect combo and feel awesome. Now in stunning visuals, the game tries hard to deliver perfection but falls short at times - stick with me while I explain why.Gameplay:This game is all about skating around the levels, mastering ramps, nailing those tricks and ultimately stacking up the biggest combo to earn the best score you can. The game kicks off with a variety of old faces to choose from with the worlds biggest skate pros round out the cast including: Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and of course -Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has over 8 boards, 3 special moves, and an alternate outfit.Normally you start the career, choose a level and spawn at a fixed place in that level. From there, you  skate and explore around the level to find things you need to complete a task from your list of objectives. Once you complete a certain number of tasks, the next level unlocks ready to be skated out.Each level has its own unique tasks to complete, once you complete them you earn cash with which you can buy skills, decks or special tricks. Upon completing the whole career mode you'll unlock the second for your character, while another mode unlocks - Projectives mode which requires 100% objective completion across every map (gaps aren't counted). This mode is the same as career mode but offers difficult challenges for those real Pro Skaters.This game also has the old school free-skate mode where you can explore every unlocked level to find new gaps or hidden areas. Beside free-skate there are also Hawkman and Big Head Survival mode. In Hawkman you have to collect pellets in various ways, they all have different colors and all need a special way to get to clarify this let me explain, red pellets are only collectable during jumps, yellow during grinds, and so on.In Big Head Survival all you have to do is keep your head growth below 100% or it will explode.. with the typical grow....expand...EXPLODE!. In order to prevent your head from bursting you have to chain combo's and long ones at that otherwise you'll fail and end up without a head not pretty. Both of these modes are great to play because they test your skills and wits. Graffiti mode also makes a return where you gotta nail combos and touch objects, upon completing the combo anything you've touched will change into your characters designated colour, the catch of this mode is to tag more objects than your opponents.Content:The content of this game is worth for it's price, you get a selection of pro skater levels and it has steam achievements. The new DLC is on it's way. The length of the game is 10-30 hours, depending on what you do in-game. If you just rush through the career you will finish the game in 10 hours, if you are an achievement enthusiast and want to master everything you'll easily clock 30 hours. Again, it all depends on your personal way of going about with the game.For me it took 30 hours to get every achievement and game modes (beside hawkman) cleared.Graphics:The game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo, using Neversoft’s original level models. All I can say is.. well done Robomodo! We finally have the HD version of the game we've been waiting for (or atleast the die-hard THPS fans). During the exploration of levels you'll just LOVE the sweet and eye-pleasing textures of the game. Everything I remember from the old games is so great to see in HD.But still there is one thing, just a little thing I didn't like and that is the rag-doll physics in this game. This is just weird, sometimes you just hang around somewhere the other time you have a long neck...you know, graphical glitches.In the old version when you bailed you'd fall on the ground, grab your board and continue riding, but here when you bail you'll face a white screen and respawn.. I have to say, it's not pretty. Even the blood has been reduced significantly.Sound:This game has a great soundtrack, it is half classic THPS tracks and half new ones. Still I would love to see more variation of music added and the ability to skip a song like in the old games. Some of the returning tracks are Superman by Goldfinger, Bring the Noise by Public Enemy ft. Anthrax while the newly added tracks are quite good too like Teenage Blood by Apex Manor and many others.Conclusion:Gameplay: 8/10+ Addictive if you played the old games+ Loads of pro-skaters to play with, as well as unlockable bonus skaters- Sometimes it's hard to complete a levelContent: 6/10+ Old tony hawk's pro skater levels in HD+ New game-modes added in singleplayer+ New upcoming DLC introduces the Revert from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (ETA: December 2012)- No Multiplayer or LAN (just for the PC version)- No Scoreboards of friends- Not able to configure or change your controls / graphic settings (needed to be done through a 3rd party launcher or just change the .ini file)Graphics: 8/10+ Great HD upgrade since the old games- Physics are sometimes weirdSound: 7/10+ Great music to listen during skateboarding- More variation of musicOverall Rating: 7/10A great skateboard game that all Tony Hawks lovers should play at least once to feel how this game really is.Loads of people disliked this game but I can't see why. Personally I don't really need a multiplayer in this game just old school skating is enough to keep me happy, you could play it with friends in the same room (just passing the controller to each other). Anyway, if you've enjoyed THPS 1 & 2 it's time to grab the remastered version and relive your childhood, or even if you're a newcomer to the series then this is the best time to start your THPS journey.NOTE: Old review i wrote for a website.

												Being a fan of the classic TH games I had to check this one out.  THPSHD uses maps from TH1 and 2 (not counting the DLC in this review) as well as the placement of objectives in this undignified remaster. After hearing me say undignified, you may think that I resent this game and think that it should burn in hell for all eternity. IMO, I do not, but it seriously lacks the dignity and respect that Neversoft originally had for the series back in its hayday. First things first, I bought this game when it was on steam sale for $5, so pricing is not an issue on that end, especially when Robomodo (the developers that took over the TH franchise since TH Ride) sold TH5 for $60, a unhinged pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ At first i was going to let this one pass as a silly game that would eventually be fixed in the long run, until they pulled the same♥♥♥♥♥♥on the full retail priced game. But enough of the price on this, lets dive in to the actual game.the good: For the most part it is a classic TH game with all obectives pretty much in the same place and alot of classic 90s tunes like Superman make a return. Another thing to note is the return of the upgrade with cash system that was used in TH2, which is a nice return to form, also there is an upgraded roster, but lets be honest, if certain skaters are missing, im less likely to care. The last thing i say that is good are the returning levels, like The Warehouse(TH1), The School(TH2),  and The Hanger(TH2). I wish there was more good i could say about it, but that would pretty much be lying at this point.The Bad: For such a game that could of taken the best ideas from the classic games, Robomodo (and Activision) decided to go the cheap route and make this game as short and barren as they possibly could to maximize profit. This makes me sad because the classics had much replayablility without feeling as repetitive. First thing I am going to hit, is how barren the game is, which is only seven levels long... Seriously... seven? That's it? No Roswell, NM? or Outer space? No Skate street?  Um.. okay. Unfortunately, thats not how shallow this game is. Remember multiplayer back in the ps1 days? Yeah those days are gone. Remember Leaderboards? Yeah, i do too... and its not in here either...How about creating your own skate park? Forget about it! Creating your own skater? ♥♥♥♥ off! Wanna know what we get instead?  Big Head Survival, which is meh okay, and Hawkman...totally sucks. But wait, we havent even gotten to the best part! The physics engine! Oh man...suuuuuucks. Wtf do you think you're doing robomoto? Making a satire of Goat Simulator? I'll admit it's really funny at first, but it gets really tiresome after an hour.One last thing, which i wont let effect my scoring of this game, but there was one level I left off of the list because i was so disappointed by what was done to it. Marsailles, France used to be my favorite level with how it was a tournament like level between you and the npcs (which you never see skate) that lasts a minute each run and you have to use your best tricks to outbeat your opponent. Well what do you get if you win? Well, a cash prize and a gold medal, which lead to future rewards. Turning my favorite level into a bland objective made me run out of steam in the end and i stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Overall, if you want to check this one out, wait until it is on sale for $5, or better yet, if you own a ps3, buy the classics used for $5 or less on amazon or ebay, and know what true classics are instead of living in a pipe dream with this one.

 If it ain't broke, why change it? I'm a long time Tony Hawks fan, but it is impossible to do anything in this game. With the input lag, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics and the addition of a 'big drop', the game no longer wants you to get those big scores that were so satisfying to get back in the Pro Skater days. Merely hit a rock and your character falls off his board like hes having a seizure.  The animation takes so long and you also have to wait a second for the game to reset your character, so falling makes you waste around 5 seconds of valuable time. The game just seems to hate you for playing it. Well, at least we have THUG Pro  "

												Simply Awesome!First of all i played the most Tony Hawks that came out in the past years and if you're looking for an evolution of the Tony Hawks series your wrong in buying this game.In my Opinion its a nostalgic feeling to play the game. So its not ""the new and improved skatinggame"" but a pretty good remake of some of the elder games with awesome graphics, a nice soundtrack, but ,and thats the only disappointment, very very sluggish physics.Sometimes you just crash when simply nothing happened or you get stuck in all kinds of objects. But thats ok for me, cause the game was very fun to play and real challenging in some points. After almost 17 hours of gaming, i completed the career mode with Tony Hawk and Nyjah Houston, completed the projectives mode with Nyhah Houston and unlocked all 15 achievements.I did not regret buying this game, for about 10€ you get a great flashback in older Tony Hawks games, if your looking for the newest and best skating game, you should not buy it.

												A incredibly mediocre Port/Remake of the first 2 THPSs, it's buggy, barely has any content and the content that is there isn't that great (Venice is the worst ♥♥♥♥ing level why is it always a recurring level???).Also Reverts are seperate DLC so amusingly Tony Hawk himself is actually one of the worst characters without stat points because you can't combo in Verts.

												Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD.Do I recommend this game?? No.This game handles like a PC port of a mobile port of a Dreamcast game.The Unreal Engine makes the unrealistic huge combos much harder, it slows the game down to a half.The Tony Hawk games are funny because you do stuff you can't do in real life, I can't jump off a roof and do a 720 Melon into a Manual, but i can sit down for a few hours, get a 10 million combo and then be happy with that.But in this game it feels like a chore, it's just not fun to play Downhill Jam over and over again.I got 100% achievements in around 8 hours of playing, most of them came easy to me, but I can see some of them being hard to get for people who arent used to the game series.This does not feel like a mix of the first two Pro Skater games, the mechanics are the same (with reverts added, they came from THPS 3) but it feels more like Project 8 and Proving Ground, fans of the series know that isn't a good thing			"

												I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews on this game. I remember playing through the entire series when they all came out and then I forgot about this series. I saw this game on sale and I bought it for the nostalgia factor. The remake had almost everything that one would want. They include about half the levels from each of the first two games and you can pay extra to get 3 levels from the third (I did because I thought the third game was awesome. My gripe is more with the DLC in that you pay half as much as you did for the game but only get a small fraction of the levels you did with the game. The controls work well, the game supported my 360 controller. I played through the entire game, and had the same amount of difficulty as the old ones, where the levels get progressivly harder and you can never really master the game. In the end, I like the game and would recomend it. I hope they make a new game or add levels available for purchase (hopefully better value for the dollar than the current DLC). Even at full price this game is worth it.			"

												This game is kind of fun for the first hour or so, then that is where the cracks begin to show. I was a big fan of the first 4 games in the series and was looking forward to visiting some of those levels again, and for a while i thought it was okay. Eventually you begin to realise the collision detection is not as it should be and you will find yourself bailing and clipping through walls quite a lot, regardless of how well you executed a trick. When you need to grind specific rails or transfer between certain verts, the game doesn't always detect it properly, which can lead to a lot of frustration. In certain instances i found the game wouldn't detect when i wanted to jump over a vert rather than come back down on it again; other times i would go to grind a rail, end up clipping it, being ""inside"" it and would bail trying to get myself out of it.The ""Big Drop"" mechanic seemed really hit or miss a lot too, sometimes i would land fine, other times it would make me bail. It didn't seem consistant at all.Repetitive music tracks, frustarating controls and the fact it still dispalys all contols with keyboard bindings even if you have a pad plugged in. Just seems pretty sloppy all round, fun for a while but can only recommend as a quick nostalgia hit.			"

												First off, do NOT get this game if you don't have a controller. That being said, it's alright. Not good, just sort of ""meh"".The game was only $10 usd so I had no problem forking over the cash. Plus, at the low price, I had low expectations for this. There are a LOT of bugs (if you try to do a flip or grab trick when landing a grind, your character flies to oblivion and the map selection has extremly little to offer. But the biggest letdown is the lack of arcade-multiplayer. Some of the best points of the series was the games: Grafitti, trick attack, and horse. None of those options are here. Just single player.All in all, it's reasonably priced for the crap revamp that it is. If you don't have much else to do, then go ahead and play it, but don't play it with any REAL expectations.			"

												This game is packaged as a combination of the first two games from the Tony Hawk franchise. The games were rebuilt by Robomodo using the original code from Neversoft.As with any rerelease of a classic game, changes are to be expected. The problem is that the game appears very much like the originals, from the environments right down to the controls on your gamepad, but the gameplay mechanics themselves have been manipulated so far beyond the titles you think you are playing that it creates a constant misleading feel for anyone who has played the originals.Another big downfall is that there is no online multiplayer, a feature which came standard with release on other platforms.Overall, there is no real way to determine if the intent was to deliver a couple fan favorites or cache in on them. If you were looking forward to playing THPS 1&2 on PC you will probably have to grab an emulator to get the expected experience.			"

												Is it terrible? No. But it is a remake that is actually worse than any other.Usually a remake is taking what was, and adding just enough to make it better. They took alot of the original boarders off, like Kareem Campbell and Bam, and added others I never even heard of. First play on the first level, I managed to fall on the top of the half pipe going to jump(which in every other game would land perfect) I tripped over air, and fell through the entire floor.I understand the original didn't have switchs between grinds and manuals, but I would assume a remake would keep it as a improvement. I would rate this a 6/10. I played so many tony hawk games from first one on n64, to THUG 1 and 2 on ps2. I never played one like this. Pro skater 3 will remain my favorite.			"

The whole thing feels spongy, the controls not as tight as they should be, and the balance system is heavily flawed. It will practically auto bail you If you attempt to get a combo going fort longer than 15 seconds or so.The Remade levels aren't bad, but the actual skating and trick engine is nowhere near the originals and you'll be disappointed. Go find a copy of THPS2 and play that instead, it still works OK on Win7.			"

Just play or emulate Tony Hawk 1-3 and the console of your choice.

												**Recommended only if you can pick it up on sale here or via Humble Store, not completely shutting this game down but i'm giving credit where its due**Decided to play for a few hours to get a better feel of the gameAs far as game mechanics go it's pretty flawed, you've for sure already heard of the nonsense physics of the engine this game is running on but it can be funny honestly sometimes seeing the ragdoll physics freakout and clip through things. But another and the main thing this game has done totally wrong is how reverts are its OWN DLC. reverting was literally how long combos were made possible and without that dlc you can not carry on combos at all and its so scummy that you gotta pay that extra bit to even play properly on top of the wonky physics the game already has. it does just take a tiny bit of time to get used to, you'll get used to the speed and turns after a good session of playing albeit learning is a little frustrating.  You should pick this game up only when its on sale along with the pack (bleh). For both the game and the DLC i picked it up on the Humble Store on sale for $7.49 all together so it wasn't bad compared to $15 for those at regular price together. Now i should give credit where its due, when you get past the flaws its actually pretty fun. You gotta map a few of your favorite tricks to the original places but when you start to learn how to play, it definitely takes you back to those good ol' days on the PS2. The music selection is compiled of all the mostly popular songs from THPS 1-4, it felt so good opening the game and you hear No Cigar come up. While still some stuff is missing from the original games like more original skaters and skitching (i think? i'm p sure cause i couldn't do it for the life of me in Los Angeles map) it's still a pretty decent time. i've had fun overall and i'm def gonna play a bit more. as a nostalgia trip it delivers pretty well so if you don't have a ps2 or a way to play the old games again then it's not too bad of a choice to pick up. Just remember it's not a complete revamp of a single THPS game but just a compilation of them all for nostalgias sake and with that said it does a good job there. If you have the means to play the original games though you really should just stick with those cause they'll do you right. It's pretty sad to know we won't get anything like those ever again			"

The level selection form tony hawk 1 is the most confusing thing ever, this supose the best selections of levels form tony hawk 1 and 2  so why in gods name is the Mall and Downhill Jam levels that no one enjoys.Music wise most of the songs form pro skater 2 (there is only one song from tony hawk 1)  make a return but the new track are okayish nothing bad but nothing  special eitherNO CHARTECER CREATOR AND NO PARK EDITOR.   ........

 This IS my Childhood! If you grew up in the 90's as a teenager this was yours too!!This game brings some of the best levels from THPS (1999), THPS2 (2000) & THPS3 (2001) and meshes them all together with a *few* new additions to make this the remake made of all wetdreams.If you don't like this game, it's because it wasn't made for you.This game was made for the Day 1 Skateboard game players from the 1998 Playstation era. This game came out originally when Marilyn Manson, Deftones, Slipknot, Powerman 5000 & Otep were the best metal bands ever!!!Play this game with that music and sit your♥♥♥♥♥down for a travel back in time, HD Style!!! This is a remake, graphical wise, but nothing else changed.... that's exactly the way it should be!!!!_____8.5/10_____CONS:- Music soundtrack could have been alot better (the left out Papa Roach, Static-X, Mudvayne, Korn and a couple other artist that I know for sure were on the official game soundtracks from back in the day.... hell, they even left out Goldfinger)- Achievements are poorly put together, the 8 or 9 that they do have are pretty boring to a go after, alot of people may feel like it's not even worht it...- The Skaters::: why remove some of the Best skaters (Kareem Campbell, Chad Muska and others) and replace them with NON skaters like Metallica frontman James Hetfield and Guitarist Robert Trujillo ???? WHY THE F.UCK did you make a seperate DLC to charge us for Geoff Rowley & Steve Cabellero?????- They want to take advantage of you: by making you purchase a DLC that gives you 3 levels from THPS 3 and the Revert move.... -_- ... maybe nextime you go to McDonalds they should make you pay for your cheeseburger and then charge you extra for the FU.CKING KETCHUP!!!!!!

												Hmm. We have an interesting game here. A remake of the classic Tony Hawk Pro Skater games? Well. Sort of. If people choose to look at this game as a brand new Tony Hawk game made in the spirit of the classics, they may enjoy it better. Why? Because the levels are really the only things that are the same. If they really wanted people to feel nostalgic, they would have left the original games alone, but they didn't. As an example, in tony hawk pro skater 1, you had to collect tapes. As in VHS tapes. Now they have changed to DVD's. Some of the objectives have actually changed as well, with some being removed and new ones being added. I thought it was a bummer that I had to buy DLC to get some of the levels from Pro Skater 3 (arguably the best one) but the DLC is cheap, so my wallet quietly weeps a little and I enjoy it. You should NOT buy this game if you want an identical experience. An original xbox or PS2 is cheap enough if you really want to replay old ones. That being said, there is something cool about this game. Its a mix of modern and classic tied together with a neat little bow on top for a measly $10. That being said, the engine feels different, and even with a controller it doesn't quite feel the same as the originals. There are little physics glitches here and there like some of the reviews mention, but I don't think they are game breaking. If you like Tony Hawk and you don't mind what I've said, pick this up. I've had a positive experience with it, but that is because my  expectations were set properly. -PR0XIDIAN			"

												Imagine an alternate universe in which Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was never released. (To start with, if such a universe sounds like hell to you, you may want to buy this game.) All the blueprints for THPS and THPS2 were lying around, and years later, a Chicago developer picked them up and thought, ""yeah, we could make something of this"".Such a situation would lead to this game, basically, a new title with a mix of levels from the first two games, in our case primarily based off of THPS2 (2X if you want to get specific). Game mechanics from titles THPS4 and onwards are not at all present, the Big Drop returns, and, actually, the Revert is a default move included with the game now. You do not need the Revert Pack to revert, and you can do so on all levels. Some of these changes may disappoint you if you're used to still playing, say, Underground 2, and expect to be able to wallplant, or jump off anything without having to hold a button, but overall it's a nice way to return to the roots.This is a modern title, and the list of skaters is a pretty obvious reminder of that no matter how much you try to see it as the 90's. Names like Chris Cole and Riley Hawk stand out even when there's no Bob Burnquist in the list, but if anything, this offers a fresh set of playable characters instead of the same-old same-old, I suppose. In the end, you're going to fully upgrade most of them, anyways. This is sort of like a reunion tour, taking you to old places while giving you new things to do and new perspective on them.There aren't really many new hidden secrets like you'd expect from the original titles. There are some, mostly characters that aren't especially easy to unlock. In general, though, the game is very open about its content, even providing a labeled map on the pause menu if you're stuck on finding certain goals. However, pretty much any secret move or area you learned in the original games is fully intact here, which I find quite admirable.The main problem I have with this game, even while I thoroughly enjoy it when it's working nicely, is that it sorta feels incomplete at points. For one, it includes 7 out of a possible 19 levels from the original games (24 levels were present in 2X alone), leaving you less overall content than the original games, though with quality over quantity in terms of visuals, presentation, and gameplay (really, how well do you remember the NY City level?).The options menu is where excuses start to fall apart. The only visual option on the menu is resolution. That's it. However, there are PLENTY of intricate options present in the BaseEngine.ini file if you need to tweak it to run smoothly on your computer. Why aren't these just in the options menu if you already programmed them? What is the options menu for if not options? Also, even if you're playing with a keyboard, the on-screen controls are ALWAYS keys despite a smooth plug-n-play transition otherwise. It's like most of the team did an amazing job making this happen and then their work got buried by bad UI decisions.The soundtrack actually lives up to exactly what you'd expect from the title. It's mostly music from THPS2, or new music that blends in well with it (except that annoying ""room in the mansion"" song, the only one I want to turn off, which by the way, you can't). It's all intensely catchy and you'll probably be listening to much of it outside the game soon after. (Only one song comes back from the first game. Yes. It's that one. You know exactly what one.)In any case, it's a new Tony Hawk game. It's a new, GOOD Tony Hawk game. If you've ever enjoyed that smooth feeling of the board sliding across a rail, if you've ever exclaimed ""Yes!"" under your breath at the raw success of landing a 720 grab into a revert into a manual into another grab, or if the word ""Kickflip TC's Roof Gap"" have any meaning to you, this will be well worth your time. The actual physics of the game are translated quite well (beyond the absolutely ridiculous ragdolling when you bail), and with plenty of game modes, the few levels don't run dry at any rate of speed (though I've never liked the Hawkman mode).There is one last thing I want to warn you about. This is a single-player game. There is no multiplayer in this in any way, shape, or form. This seems another thing oddly missing from the PC version specifically, as it is present on the console version. Doesn't matter to me, but may be a dealbreaker for you.			"

There isnt any in built controller support. Even with custom mapping on a steam controller it just doesnt play well due to lack of analogue stick support.

												I put off buying this game, even though I loved the classics, because of the bad reviews. When the sale came on I finally said whatever and bought it. The game is awesome, plays just like the old school game, except with much improved graphics. I don't get what these crybabies are talking about. This isn't a revamp of the series. It's the old school game you loved to play for hours on end. My only critisism is I wish it was longer because it's so fun to play, but there is still a lot of playtime and fun packed into this game, and at the price, it's a no brainer. Ignore the neck beards and get it.			"

												This isn't the end all be all of Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. It's a modest remake of some of the classic games for modern hardware on a modern game engine. It has a handful of iconic maps and all together makes for a pretty enjoyable expience for the price. Sure it's missing multiplayer and create a park/skater but serves for some good fun as long as you take it at face value. With the DLC it took roughly 7 hours to do just about everything there is to do in the game but I still go back to it occasionaly to play a couple rounds and I definitely feel I got my money's worth.

												I was excited to finally play THPS:HD, but immediately regretted my purchase before I was in game.  I was greeted with a 'Powered by Unreal Engine' splash, meaning this is a completely different engine, and then a 'Robomodo' splash, which while I already expected that, was still disappointing to see.  For some background - Robomodo are the people behind the Tony Hawk games that used those plastic motion control boards.  Gameplay:The balance system is completely terrible, making it impossible for long combos.  In the previous games, every time you would grind or manual in a combo, your balance meter would be slightly reset.  In this game, the balance stays the same until your combo ends, meaning if you jump off a rail and then grind back on, you will most likely bail unless your balance was perfect.The skater is incredibly slow, and grinding 90% of the time will only make him slower.  Moving just feels slippery and clunky.  Reverts require a DLC, and even then it's just as poorly implemented as the other mechanics.Levels:The levels look pretty nice and are spot on with the games they are replicating, though the goals themselves are lazily done.  For example, the competitions are replaced with just collecting 'competition medals' around the map in levels like Marseille.  In the THPS3 DLC maps there's no photo-related goals, and levels like LA have things like the car chase replaced with collecting items around the map.Conclusion:In terms of a remake, it just feels like an incomplete skating game with THPS levels and characters.  It doesn't play like a THPS game, it doesn't have mechanics introduced in the games (which are over a decade old), and just altogether isn't very fun to play.I've tried multiple times to enjoy this game, but I can't.

												I don't hate this game at all, but the reason I'm not recommending it is because they seriously need to fix a lot of the bugs in this game. The controls are way too floaty and they aren't very reliable. Sometimes the controls are very unresponsive. Almost every time I try to wall ride my character will start to do the right action and then suddenly bails by flying off the wall, spraying blood everywhere, like I just got punched by the Hulk. I will try to land a 360 kickflip, knick my board on a pixel of a ledge and suddenly my character's body is propelled halfway across the map, board nowhere to be seen and my character's limp body descending to the earth. Please tell me how this makes sense, or do I continuously break the game some how? When I clearly hit the buttons to manual, sometimes my character totally ignores the command and doing transfers off of quarter pipes is almost impossible. You have to hit ""up"" at the right time, and that right time varies every single try. If they could update it by giving the right trigger button (assuming you're playing with a controller) a spine transfer button (as well as all the other related actions like centering yourself or doing acid drops, etc.) then that would be a huge help. I know spine transfers and all those tricks weren't available in the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skaters, but just adding such a small thing, in my opinion, wouldn't detach from the nostalgia and would just give it a more playable feel. There are many times my character will bail for seemingly no reason, and some positions when I land will be okay sometimes and other times, being in the same exact position, will make me fall. The physics in this game are practically nonexistent at times.To summarize, the game is horrendously inconsistent, and as someone who has played Tony Hawk's games religiously for years, there are so many things that the other games do better and I should be able to land a lot more things than this remake allows me to. I love that they are trying to make an updated version of the original games, and I love that there is a Tony Hawk game on steam that I can play on my computer, but this game just makes me wish they'd just put THUG, THUG 2, or American Wasteland on steam as exact replicas of those original playstation 2 versions.If this game is improved and fixed, then I think it could be a great tribute to the series and much more fun than it is now, but right now there's so much frustration infused in it. When I got mad in the original games, it was because it had a constructive challenge and I just wasn't practiced enough to execute them properly. With this game, the anger comes from stupid glitches that should never happen and prevented me from doing what I should have been able to do. So get this game if you're just a super fan of Tony Hawk games like I am and/or want to have one of the games conveniently on your computer. But until they fix these problems, I'm going to stand by my ""not recommended"" review.			"

												THPSHD is a very welcome return to the franchise that I adored. But for those of you long-time fans of the series, there is something important to be aware of...This is strictly a remake using content from THPS 1 and 2 (and 3 in the DLC) Those of you who owned later games in the series will feel very limited in your mobility while playing, as a number of great features have been added over the years that do not make a comeback in this remake...-Spine and Hip Transfers-Wallpush and Wallplant-Walking off your boardIf you've used the above features, playing without them is going to make your experience a much less satisfying one without the grace that you may be expecting.Gameplay aside, the absence of any multiplayer as well as the inibility to create skaters and parks is only further limiting. The best memories I have with the series involve all three of these. Though the ability to skate is there, it feels like so much is missing.Despite this, I hope this game sells well enough to encourage Robomoto and Activision to produce a more complete remake.			"

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD! Despite all the unfounded negative critics you may have found, THPS HD is an excellent remix; and I'm a THPS veteran, so I know what I'm talking about!  The game runs very smoothly on almost every computer, resulting from a generous optimisation, yet it offers marvellous detailed textures and astounding graphics. Yes, the 'HD' part of the title is perhaps the most accurate 'HD' title I've seen on any game. It's greatly immersive, too; this remix keeps the good recipe that made the Tony Hawks series legendary, while preserving the whole fun of the first episodes, just enough to discover or rediscover your favourite maps with a fresh and welcomed rehaul!Keep in mind, this supposed to be a remake, don't be surprised if the gameplay looks a bit oldy and devoid of some fresh gameplay mechanics/content, because this was definitly meant to be a new experience for nostalgic gamers. And NO, the lack of multiplayer does NOT justify the massive hate wave you may observe on the forums. THPS HD is aimed for real fans.I could recommend the DLC as well; it's cheap and it adds the best maps from THPS 3. Seriously, buy it! 15€ is cheap for such a great arcade skateboarding game.			"

												As a person who was never really into Tony Hawk's Pro Skater or Pro Skater 2, I never really understood the legacy all that much. I was significantly more interested in the later games like Underground and American Wasteland which expanded on the gameplay a whole lot.This game feels like they took the PS1 and while modernizing it decided to keep the slow pace of it. If you've played THUG or THAW you'll know while tricking on things, it feels fast and viceral while you complete millions of points in combos. Here you sluggishly complete combos which feels like they tried to make the game more realistic.The PC port is also very bad. You can't change your resolution or any of the graphics options. They'll probably fix it in a patch, but given it's Activision I doubt it. Pro Skater HD is not what I expected and it's really hard to defend it. The only fun bits of this game involve bailing and watching a virtual Tony Hawk ragdoll fly in the air.			"

												I want to start off with saying I've played every tony hawk as a true fan up till THPS Underground 2. Before buying this game  I was looking for a bit of nostalgia. I tried it out and completed it pretty fast. It's not a long lasting game and it's definitly not replayable like the older Tony Hawk games. It's basically a mixtape of different Tony Hawk levels from Tony Hawk 1 and 2. There's a few missions in each level which do take you back to the good old days, but not too long until you find out the controls are a bit clunky compared to the Tony Hawk games in the old days. A manual feels different when I use it with my Logitech controller compared to my 360 controller and I believe this is something that should not be happening. Nothing else I could add what you don't know about a THPS game. Collect the letters S-K-A-T-E, get 150k points for the highscore, manual the 5 boxes, jump the hobo's. You name it, you probably know it if you are looking for THPS reviews.Pro:- Takes you back for a while- Replay old levels- It's a THPS game on steam- It has achievements and is pretty easily to 100%Con- Doesn't take you back long enough- Controls feel clunky depending on what controller you use (especially manuals)- There can be some graphical glitches- Crashes sometimesI recommend this game for people that are looking for a THPS on pc. If you want to play any THPS I would recommend playing one of the older games on an actual console.			"

												I had played a lot of the Tony Hawk games when I was younger from 1999 until about 2004. I remember when I got the first one for N64 and even began skateboarding in 4th grade because of it. I played:•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4•	Tony Hawk’s Underground•	Tony Hawk’s Underground 2This iteration lacks a lot of the magic from those previous games. I was wondering what it was that made me so bored of this game when it released in 2012, and I revisited it shortly to try to realize why. I discovered the following:•	No create-a-park, create-a-skater, or really any customizability.•	The levels feel old, not classic. Also, there are very, very few stages. •	The unlocking process for each stage is more of a chore because it relies on tasks completed on the previous stage, whereas before you had the option to move to another stage to try to complete those tasks.•	No way to end your run after completing one specific goal.•	Awful menu navigation.•	No multiplayer (not even locally).•	The “cash” in the game is useless. You use it to purchase tricks, but this is still way more boring than the previous iterations which let you buy stages and boards, etc.•	A couple of controls are just missing, such as the drop-in button or the leveling button that made it way easier to navigate.Overall, this port just felt rehashed over lunch, extremely lazy, and money-grabbing. Very poor quality even compared to the very first game in 1999. There are achievements I guess, but I had tons of fun with this series before achievements were ever a thing.Steer clear of this one.

The only thing I don't like about it is that they took out wallplants and manual tricks.Levels are really well textured and are exact replicas of their counterparts.Lots of replayability in terms of buying stats/boards for each character and differnet styles as well as other skaters.Overall I would highly reccomend a fan of skate boarding games.

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is phenomenal. It is pure arcadey fun. I recommend using a controller to maximise your fun levels. I'm not sure if they still have the electronic skateboard controllers available for the game, if that exists it could make the game more fun while drinking with friends. Otherwise this game is sick. The levels are tight, the music alone is worth the price of the game. The campaign is short but it is challenging to 100% it. I wish Spider-man, Wolverine and Boba Fett were in the game. If you are worried that the game won't be as good as you remembered it then you would be wrong. The game still holds up amazing today. 1/10			"

From Planet of the apes ""You Maniacs! You Blew it up!... Damn you all to hell!""I will list some of the problems that plague this game.- The PC port is horrific (and that’s putting it nicely)- No proper controller support. (It only shows you Keyboard controls even with a 360 pad connected) and they are mapped so badly its sometimes nearly impossible to pull of certain tricks without snapping your fingers- The physics barely work. It randomly launches you in the air if you try doing tricksAnd much more...I could write a novel about how bad this game is from the first 10 minutes.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!			"

												I'm enjoying it so far, but you might not. It's much of the same mechanics, but the different physics and pace give it a much more mellow feel. If you're used to the speed of the games post-THPS4, it's not unlike going from Smash Bros. Melee to Smash Bros. Brawl.This actually works against it when you max out your stats. The game starts to feel ""wrong,"" because you start doing things vaguely matching the older games at a pace that just doesn't compare. I found it more fun with default stats, but with no way of reducing them after maxing them out, I had to delete my save file.Still, though, the actual porting just absolutely reeks of laziness.			"

												Though not as fun as the originals, this graphicly updated version runs well and looks nice. I wouldn't buy it if you're expecting an awesome skating game, but if you're wanting something nostalgic this is perfect. Highly, highly, highly recommend using Big Picture Mode!

												Not as horrible as everyone makes it out to be. May be nostalgia talking, but it does a good job of replicating the ""buggy"" physics, wonky movement, and spazzing bails the classics had (yes, a positive thing if you ask me)My favorite music track, ""Superman"" is luckily still there, but I'm struggling to remember what has been replaced/is missing, if any.It could have used a few more maps and better controller support, but if you get this on a sale for a few bucks it's well worth it.I give this game four Sack Taps and a Benihana.

												This game is a joke compared to old school Tony Hawk games. The controls are EXTREMELY unresponsive. Characters no longer bail and get up, it just fades to white and resets your position. They've added new (terrible) mechanics like bailing when you drop too far. Some of the objectives have been changed from the original games. Physics engine is pathetic. Do yourself a favor and go play the original games. Avoid this at all costs.			"

												Is this just a lazy port?No. It's the laziest port.- No option to change resolution. (locked at 720p)- No other video options, such as vsync (which is badly needed)- No multiplayer at all, local or online.- You can't remap the controls.- All prompts show keyboard controls, even with a gamepad.A few of these things can be adjusted by editing the game's INI file directly, or forcing graphics options (vsync especially) on via your video card drivers. Even though it looks good (after adjusting resolution via the INI) and plays well, it's just such a lazy port that I'd feel bad recommending it to anyone.			"

												Annoying bugs, bails and built in the wrong engine. Since 2007 THPS has suffered with the release of EA's Skate in an attempt to move from its arcade like roots and try (and fail) a more realistic approach which really doesn't fit the franchise. I can only recommend THPS HD because it is simply the best modern instalment of the game since American Wasteland back in 2005. With Neversoft out of the picture and THPS 5 being the final nail in the coffin this is probably going to be the best we are going to get. The DLC is worth getting as it recreates some great levels and extends the career mode which is very fun to complete. PC port only has Single Player and outside of Career Mode the difficulty in the other game modes is punishing.			"

												Some great and impressive detail they've go into on some of the classic levels and nice having a game that works everytime rather than messing around with emulators etc. trying to replay the PS1 versions.However, NO MULTIPLAYER (ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!) and it plays differently; I played the originals on emulator and this one back to back and the movement is very different, not as responsive, slower turns and weird glitches when you bail hard.Having said that, still really enjoyed it as soon as I got over the couple of bugs, worth it for under £10 and the extra 3 maps (DLC) are also worth grabbing (even if they should have just been included in the main game (freeking DLC, sigh!).

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is a weak♥♥♥♥♥attempt by the folks at Activision to bring the THPS series back to basics.Featuring the ""greatest hits"" of the early games in the form of remade maps (e.g. School II, Warehouse, Downhill Jam etc) and a retro inspired soundtrack complete with music from the first two games, on paper this might seem pretty neat. Don't be deceived. Not only does this game feel unfinished, missing many maps that should of been included in THPS HD to begin with (e.g. Airport) but it is functionally broken. Robomodo clearly aren't as talented as their Neversoft forebearers. There are more than a few noticeable glitches that ruin play including bails that will send you rocketing into the sky and strange clipping/draw-in issues that plague many of the levels. THPS HD looks and plays far worse than Project 8, a Tony Hawk's title released nearly six years prior. The controls in general also feel awful in this release, not half as responsive nor as snappy as you'd hope. Perhaps what upset me the most about this release is the lack of multiplayer modes. Tony Hawk's online was one of the first experiences I had playing over the internet and I imagine it still has people playing it via XLinkKai. To see the multiplayer missing in this release, even in terms of local splitscreen play, is a complete let-down as far as I'm concerned.So should you bother with this release? Not really. If anything, this release is aimed at suckers to nostalgia such as myself. If you want to relive the memories of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater  there are far better ways of doing it. Nothing is stopping you from getting any of the earlier releases in the series on PC so if you insist on running the likes of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 in actual high defintion, nothing is stopping you from doing that instead.

												I would highly recommend this to people who played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the PlayStation. The nostalgia of replaying some of my favorite levels is great, and the visual aspect of seeing them in HD is always a plus. I would strongly recommend for a controller to be used. I use a PS2 controller (had to forge an xinput dll for it to work for PS2/PS3 controllers). Should work fine out-of-the-box with a 360 controller, but you won't have the nostalgia you get from using a dualshock with this game. Overall I'd say this is an 8/10 and a must-own for anyone who collects the Tony Hawk-branded games like I do.Edit: While I do still recommend this, I must mention that the engine it uses has absolutely terrible physics and the game is pretty much impossible to get used to. It feels so slow compared to the old ones, and that is an absolute downer. Not for everyone.			"

												This game isn't meant to be discovered now, this game was released for those nostalgics that spent countless hours with a PlayStation controller in their hands doing flips, grab tricks, grinding and doing manuals to get the 2,000,000 points trick.It's a merge of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. Thankfully, they didn't change any of the stages: they preserve their structure and their objectives but, unfortunately, the game doesn't include all the stages found in the first and second edition. It has lost many features from the original games so we can call this a light remake.You can still have a lot of fun with this game, so don't hesitate!			"

												I am heavily disappointed.  Right off the bat I felt like the game was slightly off, I remember in THPS 2 how much fun and solid it was on a keyboard.  Here I find myself having difficulty getting the skater to do what I want, not to mention the control configuration kinda sucks and it isn't customizable...because that's totally impossible fo a PC to handle.  Finally the game has alot of weird gimics with bailing, running into walls will often make you bail, landing slightly off from straight makes you bail, heck even at times landing straight will make you bail.  I wish they had just taken the old games and updated the graphics but left everything else the same.  Regret buying this, save yourself the $10 and spend it on something more worthwhile than this, like sandwich.			"

												This game has been updated and given a fancy new look... but it's such a shame because Tony Hawk HD is single player ONLY. Some of the fondest memories I have of playing Tony Hawk (especially the first game) were playing with my friends on good old co-op split screen and racing down the dam (or whatever), through the mall, or just doing points competitions until you realised your opponent was playing Bam Margera and doing Christ Air combos everywhere until you banned them from doing it.If this game had been updated for internet play, or even had LAN/split screen co-op, then this would have been a great game indeed... but sadly it's just a single player skating game that feels like it's lacking something.I don't know if it's the skater handling/physics, I can't pick if it's the slightly altered level designs or the slightly unusual trick flow... but I know that after playing this game for maybe an hour and a half, I was pretty tired of it. The whole point of the game seems to be to play a level over and over until you've completed all the objectives so that you can go onto the next level and do it all over again. There's no point, no payoff, no real challenge and nothing changes. It's a stagnant game that might fog up your nostalgia goggles, but not much else.			"

												Was not disapointed with the purchase.Having been a big fan of the series for the PS2, Its nice to finally see it  on the pc.The game itself is bugged a bit. But then again, all the games were buggy.You get the classic maps, but if you look at the negative reviews, it is true that you kinda have to buy the dlc.  I agree they should have not of made it DLC but as a full product.Looking at some of these negative reviews that claim to play the series, they will mention the bugs and bad physics. Let me tell you that the series always had that. For every system it was covered with bugs. Hell, i even broke out the ps2 and replayed them. They were never perfect. The bugs in this game are tolerable and i find to be funny. I was doing a manuel up a quarter pipe and fell, then for some reason launched me up to the ceiling. I enjoy bugs like that, they give it the sence of nostalgia.Another thing is the controls. its keyboard oriented so it feels weird and takes time to get used too. what i do love however, is the controller support. It works on Windows 10, and was able to plug in my xbox one usb controller and have not tried the keyboard controls since. The button mapping is the same as the old games which is nice. Overrall i enjoyed the game, im not the one to knitpick for bugs. Graphics look nice, and generally got that feeling of playing the old games.			"

												See my full review with screenshots and more at http://misstoxia.com/review-tony-hawks-pro-skater-hd/Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is definitely aimed at fans of the original Pro Skater series, it features maps, music, skaters and challenges from the early games in a blatant effort to provoke nostalgia from fans like me. The game takes you back to two minute runs with classic career objectives such as getting the secret tape, kick flipping TC’s roof gap and what not. In addition to the Career mode, the game also has a few other game modes such as Big Head Survival, Hawkman and extra Projectives when you finish Career.Yes, the high school level is back! Yes, the warehouse level is back! And yes you can once again Ollie the Magic Bum 5x. Most of the best levels from Pro Skater and Pro Skater 2 are included as well as three levels from Pro Skater 3 if you purchase the Revert Pack DLC which also adds the revert mechanic which significantly increases your combo potential.While the game has obviously gotten a huge graphics upgrade, I felt like the physics were a bit… off. Things seemed to feel more realistic in the original games, but in HD it feels like I’m sometimes flying unnaturally through the air. There’s also no animations for stacking/bailing; your character just kinda ragdolls on the spot and spurts out blood.The PC version unfortunately has a few optimization and other console-porty errors and doesn't contain multiplayer (yet the console version does!). There’s also no skater creator like there was in Pro Skater 2 and 3, but instead, a decent assortment of uncanny-valley-esque professional skaters from both the older games and current real-life professionals.I personally, really liked HD, I loved the playing the old maps, hearing the old music (the new music was really good too!) and the simplistic game mechanics of the original Pro Skater games before the series let you natas-spin fire hydrants for 10 minutes and walk around off-board whenever you please.However if you were late to the series you might not find HD as fun as other Tony Hawk’s games, as this is purely a remake of the original Pro Skater games and doesn’t really improve on the old features much, but if you’re looking for a fun childhood nostalgia trip, I recommend you give Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD a look.

												Got this game for dirt cheap, on sale after reading a lot of mixed reviews. There really is not a much that needs to be said about this game. The bottom line is if you enjoyed the orginal back on the PS1 days then you'll enjoy this *updated* version. While the locations remain the same (or very similar) the game is fun for a cheap price bringing back memories. For those who expect more then a graphical update this game is not for you.I enjoy the updated graphics, skaters, and music. This game is perfect for a quick nostaliga fix when you dont want to dust off your old Playstation. The only thing that has really bugged me so far in the short time I've played are the crazy physics when you fall of your board... you sometimes go flying sky high like you're on the moon... its rather silly. Otherwise I suggest this game for a quick old school skating fix... grab it when its on sale for just a few dollars!			"

												Even though this has alot of mix reviews i think for 10 dollars (i got it for 5 dollars on sale) it's what you pay for, The game doesn't exactly feel like the old Pro Skater ones but the controls are not bad ""If you use a controller"" There is a pretty good size roster of skaters in the game to and not even counting the dlc, The levels are very close to their original with not much changes, If i have to say one thing i do not really care for in this game is that you can't wallplant well... i don't think that was in the older Pro Skater games it just was more common afterwards to have it. I can't really call this a thing i hate just somthing i wish the game had but, The levels in the game lack the pedestrians you would see walking around in the levels ""Sure the Canada stage had some peds standing around but they pretty much did nothing, and would of not been needed at all""The closest thing to peds in most stages are some random vehicles being drivin around and a guy riding a cabby around ""there isn't even anyone inside the cars driving"" It's okay most of the time but for a level like the ""Airport"" or ""Los Angeles"" It really loses it's charm... I guess if i can think of a reason for lack of peds was because they wanted the game to feel like the classic old Pro Skater games on ps1 and n64 where there was no peds. But besides some nitpicks i would recomend you try it out!			"

												It is awesome to see the Tony Hawk series finally return to its roots.  After the many attempts at playing with new ideas, then going out of control with further attempts at innovation to escape escalating competition, Robomoto had finally decided to take the series back to how Neversoft originally envisioned the series from the beginning.  So to finally play the remake of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 & 2 put together was quite a treat.With that said, do I recommend this game?  NO.Robomoto was responsible for making Tony Hawk Ride and Shred.  Both were attempts at pushing their skateboarding controller, and failed due to the overpricing of the software and perpherial considering how lack luster the content was.  If you want the full run down on that, I recommend you refer to scxcr's review of the first game: 


YouTube™ Video: Five Dollar Gaming: Tony Hawk Ride (PS3) 

			Views: 38,286		

			""If you got a problem with Tony Hawk, get off your wheels and take a phony walk."" -Ill Mitch, ""Fast and Danger""		

So with Robomoto coming back to develop a classic Tony Hawk game would understandably leave people into a lot of doubt.  While they actually did attempt to make a classic Tony Hawk game, ""attempt"" being the key word here, it just falls short on its delivery.  The first game had a good set of levels and skaters, a two player mode, along with customizability, which were expanded greatly with each game, such as adding a custom-skater option, a bunch of cameo characters to play with (Spider Man skateboarding?  How can you go wrong?!), custom-park mode where you can make your own levels, and even LAN or online play in future titles.  THPS1 & 2 were remade as THPS2X as an Xbox Exclusive, including everything from both games plus a new set of levels.When you play THPSHD, it just feels... empty.  It felt more like a proof of concept game than anything.  Especially released on PC where you get virtually no graphic options.  It is as barebones as it gets.  You don't get every single level, no custom-skater mode, no skate shop, no custom-park, not even a two player mode.  I feel ashamed to even bought this in hopes that it means there will be more Tony Hawk games like this.  But alas, Robomoto had failed me, and I am sure it failed everyone too.  Especially with their latest release of THPS5, which had suffered numerous problems, lack a lot of content, and dared to bare a name that left the classic series so highly regarded back then.To summarize: Don't buy this game.  It is bad.			"

												This game plays very slowly and choppily. This is not because of poor hardware--if you have poor hardware, watch out, because it will play WORSE, and there are no video options in the game that will help your poor system cope.The awkward feel of the game is, instead, the result of too many animation frames slowing movement and generally adding a longer delay between input and on-screen action. Being someone who still plays all of the classic THPS games regularly, I can say this:THPS 3 and 4 were incredibly tight and responsive, perfect for gameplay. 1 and 2, in retrospect, didn't quite hold up to those standards on the Dreamcast. The PS1 versions of 1 and 2 were even worse than the Dreamcast's. THIS GAME doesn't even hold up to the standard set by those PS1 releases. There's no excuse for a game in this day and age to fail to hold up to an early PS1 title.I'm really wishing I'd read the reviews before purchasing this game because I just wasted my money.			"

No side-by-side splitscreen, or online insanity.Create-a-Skater is not available - for making your own character or caricature. Create-a-Skater was a huge thing for me way back.Making your own skate park - not available. This was highly prominent throughout the whole series. Having played THPS 1~4, THUG, AW - and even the DS version American Sk8land -, creating your own skate park was a feature.I'm just glad I paid less than a dollar from Amazon for this game to have it on Steam than paid the $10 for it.

It's not polished or perfect, it could have been better, but it's okay. 100% nostalgia hit.			"

												I LOVED every THPS game from the first and the moment I saw this on Steam, I purchased it without question. I downloaded it and started it up, plugged in my gamepad and was ready to go. No dice. It wouldn't recognize my controller so I downloaded an XBox controller emulator as thats what everyone recommended on the forums. No dice. Spent nearly 6 hours doing everything in my power to get my controller to work. Nothing. Nada. Zip.Needless to say, I am disappointed beyond belief. I tried to use the keyboard controls and it was clunky and extremely difficult to coordinate jumps and tricks with ease.Fast-paced gameplay + clunky keyboard controls + no way to use controller without purchasing an XBox controller = Bad experience and major disappointment.

												It's not the best Tony Hawk game in the series but it is the best one in a while. After Underground 2 the series has been repetitive and stale, this game repackages levels from Pro Skater 1 and 2 (and 3 if you buy the DLC) into one whole experience that is fun and plays great. Some people will complain that this doesn't have multiplayer, but those who enjoy classic Pro Skater gameplay simply won't care about the missing feature. Sure some people will have gripes about which maps from Pro Skater 1 and 2 were chosen over others, but I had fun with every map in this game.Put simply, this is classic Pro Skater gameplay and it plays similar to the ones on the N64, Playstation and Dreamcast. So if you were into those games chances are you might like this one, and if you didn't get a chance to play them you should still check this game out since it's a fun skateboarding game that doesn't take itself seriously.

												THPS HD is pretty true to form if you are accustomed to the older style of the THPS series. What does that mean? It means no flatground tricks, sans the manual, no linking together epic scores, and a lot of do-overs for certain goal requirements that are set. I know many are saying these detract, but I honestly find it just as exhilerating and exasperating as I remember. Granted, sometimes it will take you a whole run to complete one goal, and you might have to have a few runs, even with the new map feature that displays item locations. But what I liked about that when I was a kid was that that's how you would actually skate. Pick a spot, set up, and keep at it til you got what you wanted. If you want to progress through the single player, the goals can seem tedious at times, and the physics match the sometimes sluggishness of what the originals had in store for a skater (think wallrides...). That being said, I threw in the towel after THAW, and now that I don't have any next gen console versions, I think this is a fair attempt to recreate some of the charm of the originals, especially with it being decently cheap. Yes, there is no multiplayer, Yes, there is no create-a-skater, yes, there are limited levels, DLC nonwithstanding, however for someone like me who doesn't mind a single skate to just burn an hour away and embrace some nostalgia, this is worth it. The graphics are decent enough for any remake of this nature, and my controls work perfectly on a wireless 360 controller. 8/10			"

												I love tony hawk games, they're my guilty pleasure. I have played just about all of them and if I am not careful I could lose my entire day playing these games. That said this one doesn't grab me.Rather than finding myself enjoying the game I feel like it is a set of tasks that I must run through. The enjoyment is missing and I attribute this to a few things.Glitches- numerous so many its disgusting, and I am not talking about the fun walking/skating around outside the map, I am talking about hitting a rail/ramp at an angle that sends you flying mid combo causing you to crash and lose all your points, It was cool the first couple times but when it happens almost everytime I load a level its charm is quick to wear off.Graphics - disgusting really, the textures are blobby and the pop in happens nearly everytime you turn around, and something just feels off about the characters that gives them a creepy dead rather than alive feel. Also more than once I have had flickering lighting in half pipes on walls etc.Sound/Music - The music selection is very small and terrible causing me to turn it down and run my own in the background. However this won't mask the odd sound every once in awhile. Also everytime you do ANYTHING as the little kid in the blue (I don't know his name) he makes this terrible grunting noise that makes me want to strangle him.Style/Gameplay - I put this here because I can't shake this odd feeling the game isn't sure what it wants to do. It has this awkward middle ground between the new tony hawk games and the old ones trying to mix them together in a great way but instead it seems they took the worst of both and we got this odd mess that doesn't play like it should.Port issues - no way to change the resolution controls graphic options select songs etc. You can edit the ini files to acheieve more desirable results but it is a time consuming pain. Also once again owning a logitech controller instead of a xbox controller screws me over as I have to spend a good many hour trying to edit ini files to get it to work with this game properly (some people got 360ce working with this but I couldn't for the life of me even though it works with many other games I have). Multiplayer is gone from the console versions, and there is no create a park or skater option either.DLC - this is pretty underhanded, in order to use the trick revert (spin around when landing in pipes to keep strings of combos going) you have to pay, you do get 3 extra levels from tony hawk 3 but for 5 bucks its not much and pretty much essential if you want to be able to revert.Overall the game is a mess and plays terrible, it took me a good while to get used to it and I don't get the same enjoyment from it as I do from just booting up my N64 or PS1.Yet I still pull it up to play it from time to time. I think its the ocd side of me wanting to 100% everything because I know I can.I would only recommend this game to the most diehard tony hawk fans that can put up with the beforementioned crap but for everyone else I wouldn't reccomend it even a little bit.

												I would totally recommend this game to sports fans, especially those who have played THPS 1-4 in the past. Tons of familiar levels, players, tricks, stats, and goals return in this awesome game. Spell S-K-A-T-E, Pro score, hidden objects, all familiar ever since they first released THPS 1. I've been playing Tony Hawk games since it was first released, this game is awesome and brings back a lot of memories. Only a few problems with this game, I have caught a few glitches here and there but not likely to happen again. Other is controls. Unless you have an Xbox 360 controller, good luck trying to play this game on a keyboard. Trust me, I know, it is VERY difficult. Not impossible but difficult. Otherwise, I went and got an Xbox 360 controller to help me play this game and it feels like I'm using a PSOne controller again. Seriously, if you have played any of the old THPS games, buy this one. It is worth the money.			"

												Oh if only Activision had given Robomodo some legit time to finish this game and make it complete.  I like what's offered (try and get it with the DLC on a sale, but DON'T get it without the DLC) but I feel like it's just not enough.  I want much more.  Create a skater, create a level, and even the THUG era Create a goal modes really brought me back to these games over and over and over again.  This game has none of that.  I WISH I could see the modding community go wild with this game adding more levels and more modes, but I know that isn't going to happen unfortunately. :(  I'll still enjoy this game for what it is but if I want a full featured, robust Tony Hawk experience, I'll play THPS4, THUG, THUG2, and THAW.I'm not knocking this game as it is quite fun and it's great seeing these classic levels look so beautiful, I just wish there were more to this package.  Well, what can you expect from modern day Activision.  *sigh*			"

You cannot reconfigure the key layout, video options are basically non-existant, no custom skater, no map creator.Despite those negative sides though, if you simply want to play the old skating game without a care in the world, its perfect. :)			"

												The fact that you can't map your keyboard controls was just pure lazyness on the part of the developers, and I would not recommend the game until they put out an update to fix this, so you can assign controls how you like.Now I have to re-learn the whole thing because I am used to completely different keys, to do the tricks and to control the skater [yes I still remember how I played the originals, as I played them A LOT].I haven't played the game much because of this. But from first impresion it looks good on my 1080p screen, apart from the slightly weird physics when you fall down.Not recomended until they fix up the basics. "

												TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY: TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER® HDby JunkStarPROS:✭Nostalgia! Maps and mechanics are authentic✭Graphics are a big improvement over anything emulated✭Controls feel tight✭Includes memorable maps from THPS 2+ CONS:✭A heap of missing features from the original games, including:     -Seriously nerfed soundtrack (~10 songs)      -No custom soundtrack     -No custom characters     -No multiplayer     -No map editor✭Buggy: Frequent clipping problems and freezing most notable✭Not enough content FINAL DECISION: After getting every single achievement, I can say the game is too brief for a single player game. Without multiplayer (there isn't even local multiplayer) or the wonderful map editor, there just isn't enough content to justify the game. On sale: yes, absolutely buy it.It's a shame because there is so much potential on steam to utilize multiplayer and map editors.   :(			"

												So many people are complaining about the controls on this game, and honestly, I don't understand their hate.  There are EIGHT (count em) buttons to push.  In addition, They rag on the ""poor"" and ""repetitive"" music selection.  First off, the music is grade A 90's throwback, and I enjoy all of it quite a bit.  Nothing like Pidgeon John and Goldfinger.  And for complaining about which maps were brought back, people were gonna complain about that no matter which ones were chosen.  With this game, you basically get what you pay for.  It's nothing new or innovative, but its a refreshing throwback that is simply fun to play.  Oh, and the occasional glitch that sends you soaring through the air, or flying through the ground, those just add another measure of fun to the game, because they only happen after you have already crashed.

												The fact that you can't map your keyboard controls was just pure lazyness on the part of the developers, and I would not recommend the game until they put out an update to fix this, so you can assign controls how you like.Now I have to re-learn the whole thing because I am used to completely different keys, to do the tricks and to control the skater [yes I still remember how I played the originals, as I played them A LOT].I haven't played the game much because of this. But from first impresion it looks good on my 1080p screen, apart from the slightly weird physics when you fall down.Not recomended until they fix up the basics. "

												So many people are complaining about the controls on this game, and honestly, I don't understand their hate.  There are EIGHT (count em) buttons to push.  In addition, They rag on the ""poor"" and ""repetitive"" music selection.  First off, the music is grade A 90's throwback, and I enjoy all of it quite a bit.  Nothing like Pidgeon John and Goldfinger.  And for complaining about which maps were brought back, people were gonna complain about that no matter which ones were chosen.  With this game, you basically get what you pay for.  It's nothing new or innovative, but its a refreshing throwback that is simply fun to play.  Oh, and the occasional glitch that sends you soaring through the air, or flying through the ground, those just add another measure of fun to the game, because they only happen after you have already crashed.

												I highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed the original THPS's. Could have used some multiplayer or custom level creation game modes, but the single player mode is great. Very nostalgic feel, and it still holds up as a fun arcade-style game you don't have to invest a lot of time into. The soundtrack is just like those from the original series that everyone loved. The song count is unfortunately pretty small though, so after about 10 repeats of each track I started using my own music instead.I do not recommend playing by keyboard.			"

I would not recommend this game for THPS fans. If you want to play real THPS then get yourself a PS1 version it's much more fun than this game. But it's really nice to see all thoose reworked maps and good old soundtrack. But I expected much more from this game.4/10 "

												What to say? It attempts to emulate what the first two Tony Hawk games got right but, in the end, turns up to be half baked. Only implementing what the first two games had introduced means that there are no reverts involved in the game, which results in vert sections being seldom used for combos. Additionally, the combo system is... floaty, often landing on rails instead of grinding, leading to infuriating combo breakers that wouldn't have happened otherwise.Also, no Create-a-Skater, Create-a-Park or multiplayer? dafuq.That's not to say it's entirely terrible, definitely a step up from some of the previous Tony Hawk games, but then again ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a DVD case is better than some of the previous installations, too. Also, Superman.Overall, the game turns up to be a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt at emulating what made the games great, the PC port is lacking, no rebindable keys in menu, fixed video settings and keyboard icons not accounting for controllers.

												Its better to think about this game as THPS 2, has the same features and controls and such. If you go into this with the mindset of THPS 1 you are going to be very overwelmed, as with the implemation of manuals, the game suddenly expects you to earn much higher scores that seem just unrealistic in the original Pro Skater. The game itself is sort of clunky feeling but once you get used to the unusual graphical/animation changes it does sort of start to feel a little like the originals. I only bought this game because I was craving playing the game that I love so much, but it came with 3 more maps from different games for the extra 5 dollars which I didn't actually think was worth it. The price wasn't too bad, and  was lower than I would expect them to price it. I ended up beating the entire campaign in under 2 hours, but this is mainly because I used to play over THPS 1 and 2 on my NIntendo 64 all day and I got pretty good at finishing the games in reasonable times.All in all maybe it would just be better to download and emulation of the games online, THPS 1-4, if you were feeling like reconnecting with these games.

												I was initially dissapointed when this game came out. However, after the release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, I actually really appriciate this game. Unlike Pro Skater 5, it doesn't present itself as a sequel, so the missing features from later Tony Hawk games can be excused. There are stupid features like the big drop mechanic, but those were atleast in the originals, and not added in a lousy attempt to make the game more interesting. Overall, I recommend buying this game, only because it's the only Tony Hawk game released since 2007 that isn't COMPLETE♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The disappointing last gasp of a once proud series that revolutionized funsports games at the turn of the millenium.The Tony Hawk series of Arcade Sports Sims have been a safe bet from the get-go as far as fluid and fun gameplay, inventive level design, great soundtracks and charming humour are concerned. Some of these elements can be found in this HD remake of a small selection of levels and songs from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 brought back from the dead with the voodoo of the Unreal Engine which as usual does an admirable job even after so many years. The classics don't lose their magic and you will keep finding new lines and combos even after years (and I should know, I've been playing the series since 1999) however the selection of levels and songs is rather small and the levels themselves aren't big either, because they were designed with the limitations of late nineties consoles. There is not much to do here,a tiny assortment of gameplay modes that each eschew any sort of invitation to play them for more than a few rounds. A tiny amount of purely cosmetic unlockables, play it through once, never pick it up again. There's also no multiplayer on PC.This anorexic approach to game design is further mangled by a failed revamping of the gameplay. The new physics engine lacks the tight and fluid control that the series is known for. There are no ways to change key bindings in-game, the process to change the .ini files is lengthy and tedious for anyone not playing with the xbox controller and even then the controls just seem off or wobbly for lack of a more technical term. Graphical settings are handled in the same shoddy manner. ini or die.THPS HD comes off as the final lazy attempt to cash in on the last breath of a dead series. Namesake Tony Hawk always seemed very sincere about the series he helped create and connected it deeply in skate culture, but here they just dropped the ball so hard it tunneled miles past where the catastrophic Tony Hawk's Shred and Ride finally came to rest covered in money glued on with the tears of children who got them as christmas gifts. There's no real market for this game. Old fans will be disappointed, newcomers will be turn off their computer in frustration. If you want to play the series again or the first time on PC, there are so many better options. Tony Hawk's Underground 1 and 2 run well on modern systems because of a dedicated modding community, THPS 2 to 4 were also released on PC. Even buying the first two games on playstation for the estimated 2 bucks they will cost you and firing up an emulator will get you a better experience overall and better introduction to a great series of times past, filled with hours upon hours of highly addictive fun.

												Its not amazing, but It's definitely the closest to a THPS game we have that modern. I love the feeling, its responsive, however, Sometimes I question a few bails here and there, especially when on the older games the error margin was a lot smaller. It misses a few iconic levels here and there, A lack of park editor, trick editor and nice other TH content, but as a game that was made to recreate some fo those older levels and bring back the joy of THPS, it worked. Is it worth £7? With the DLC yes but without, no. The Revert pack is almost a must in terms of those looking to nail some huge Combo's and bring a lot of the feeling back, shame its a DLC.To be honest, This game could've been amazing, but even then, I Paid £5 for this game and I think it plays well and was a good direction for THPS. It certainly isnt bad considering its polished and works well, when I paid £30 for the game on PS1 back in the day for each of them. I get to recapture THPS whilst looking smooth for less than a fifth of the price.			"

However, if you go in expecting a Tony Hawk game on the PC that may have a few bugs and glitches but still manages to captue the classic feel of the game, then I would recommend it. As an old school fan, I have some issues with the game but overall it is a really fun game to come home to after a long day of classes.

												This game has great nostalgia value as it does the original versions of THPS justice, working with XBOX and PS3 controllers but with a few issues.  Sadly it's is more of a Greatest Hits album only featuring a handful of levels from the originals.  A few things that brings this game down in value are that you can't change the key bindings.  It's likely possible to change them using a keyboard emulator but it's very much a pain in the behind.  Another awful thing about this game is that the menu where you pick which tricks you'd like your skater to be able to execute, it only shows icons for your PC's keyboard and not XBOX or PS3 controller key icons.  So if you play using a controller, you have to remember that (, = X) and that(. = Y) and that (/ = B)  Confused? Yea that'll happen if you try customize your tricks at all.  In summary, this game is worth $10 if you're willing to deal with the lack of levels and poorly thought out control scheme.			"

												As a stand alone game, this game would be okay. But, since this is a HD-remake, I will have to reccomend it thereafter. It fails to capture the magic from the two first THPS-games, and it shows. The charm has disappeared from the game entierly. The fact that this game is a poor console-port does not help it's case either. I will reccomend this game if you have not played any of the THPS-games. If you have, play those instead. This game is simply not worth the money.			"

I was expecting all the classic sound effects and tracks, but a lot of things are missing.  Also, the physics have changed a lot, and the classic bail animations are gone so your character kinda rag dolls instead and it just looks glitchy.  I've also glitched through the floor a couple times.  A lot of the original skaters are gone, and they could've picked a couple more levels, like Burnside and SF.  It's nice b/c it works w/ a 360 control, but eh, save your money.			"

Posted: July 31, 2014
												First off, thanks for reading my review, i will try to be as objective as i can.My first THPS that i have ever played was the 4th part, and it was the best in my opinion. I also played both Underground series as well as Project 8. When i saw the HD remake of the game, i was really excited, but after a while it made me sad. Why?Let's start right off with the not-so-good- things: - The physics. At some point, they are great, flip tricks and grinds feel realistic to me, but when it comes to air time and several movements, it looks reeeaaally unrealistic. That's what i loved about the older THPS games, where the movements were more realistic.- The tricks. What just happened with the tricks?! I LOVED the wide spectrum of tricks you could do in the old THPS games, such as flatland tricks (casper, handstand, pogos etc.). All you can do here is simple manuals. NOT EVEN PIVOTS. And moreover, you are not able to do Double/Triple Flips. If you wanna do a Double Kickflip, the skater does two Kickflips seperately mid air. WHY?! This is so messed up. Double/Triple Flips are part of the game! I will never understand why they removed that. They didn't even include Tre Flips. This is a standard trick which is must-have in every skate game. But here, nope. Another sad point, you cannot combine grinds. In the early THPS games you could press square, triangle or circle to combine more grinds in one (you were able to do Nosegrinds to Nosebluntslides without jumping in between). And, what actually annoys me the most, you cannot edit special tricks properly, since the game only shows the keyboard buttons, but not the controller buttons. BIG thumbs down.- Extended Functions. You cannot edit or create a skater. REALLY?! This is really upsetting. That was such a cool function back then. All you can do is buy different boards, thats it. Boring! Where is my beloved park editor?! Oh, and not to forget simple nuances like Soundtrack. Seriously, i feel like this game didnt recieve any amount of love towards the older parts. I want to see the playlist, and i want a great amount of music while skating. Why not include a function where you can listen your own tracks like they did in Project 8 or Underground 2? (not sure which of these 2 games featured that). To be honest, i am fine with the graphic settings, it is okay for me to only set the resolution. I do not need more than that. - Other stuff. Yes, what i also want to mention is the audio engine. Lets say you skate the mall and you crash through a glass wall. The breaking glass is so enormously loud that it almost broke my ears. I know i am picky but... seriously... i am used to perfectly made skating games, so i do demand a lot from remakes. Also, the amount of levels is really messed up. I basically unlocked all levels in one day, where is the fun?? I would LOVE to skate Chicago in the remake, as well as San Francisco. I am kinda stuck to THPS4 so... And oh yeah, i almost forgot that, wallrides, manual combos and grinds barely work. Another thumbs down for that. Also, replays are not included. I still dream about one day where game developers include a replay function with different camera settings in a sports game, so you are able to create awesome cinematics, some sort of virtual skate videos/movies. I am still hoping... Let's come to the conclusion.If you want to play a skating game in between queue times of League of Legends or if you want to play something quick, then buy this game. It is okay for that price. But if you do want a great skating game, if you want variety and an awesome experience, DO NOT BUY IT. Install PCSX2, download THPS for PS2 and play that, it will satisfy you A LOT more.			"

												• Has no multiplayer mode, despite the console versions both having it. (It's an unreal 3 engine title, you would think they can port it easy)• Has no gamepad support, you have to download a third-party program to use a gamepad other than a 360 controller.• Has no option to change your controls, you are stuck with the keys they have given you. > is the grind key for some reason. Don't know how I am meant to skate using the arrow keys, start a grind with > then use WASD to balance the grind and for tricks ughh• Has no graphics options, you can't even change your resolution without editing some config file. It just sets your resolution to 1280x720 and when you quit the game it doesn't revert your computer to your desktops resolution.• Physiscs are weird as hell, nothing like Tony Hawk. This HD remake is done in the Unreal Engine and the developers didn't even try to get the physics close to the original games.I bought this game as soon as it was available on Steam as i'd been watching videos of the console versions with envy and really wanted to challenge my friends to the game, turns out buying it instantly was a mistake becuase it has no multiplayer at all on PC			"

												Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD is a blast from the past. I can remember putting in countless  hours of play in this game with my friends. The original version was released on consoles when the Playstion one was new and hot. This game opened the door for skater games to be popular but no one did it as good as Pro Skater 1 & 2. Some of the newer Tony Hawk stuff is crap and are usually rated pretty bad but this isnt one of the bad ones. In my opinion this is the best Pro Skater game and the HD upgrade makes this an easy purchase. Everything about this game is the same as the original except the HD overhaul and change in soundtrack. As good as the game is theres not much new brought to the table. The mechanics are the same as I remember on PS1. I see alot of negative reviews for this but I think its because people remember the controls being more responsive than they were. I played the PS1 version recently and I couldn't wait to go back and play this version instead. The game is worth the $9.99 price tag, but if you are on the fence about it wait for it to go on sale again.7\10			"

												Let me start by saying that what you pay is what you get. If you're willing to pay a few bucks for a small revisit, I'd recommend it. You can choose between a few levels from THPS and THPS2, all revamped in gorgeous HD graphics. The models and levels look fantastic. Skating around can be fun if you get around the bad physics.However, the game does have its flaws. The physics are wonky and sometimes irritating. The falling animation is just ridiculous. Also, this game lacks any customization at all. You can't change the controls, you can't change the looks of your skater, you can't create your own park, nothing. There isn't even a multiplayer modus. The only thing there is, is singleplayer. But, that didn't prevent me from having some fun while beating all the game's objectives.I myself have enjoyed many hours of singleplayer skating just because I liked the revamped levels and I got used to the wonky physics. Yes, there isn't a lot to this game, but this game is not a bad game for what you pay. It's just not a ""full"" Tony Hawk game, only a small revisit for a few bucks.I'd recommend this game despite its flaws, but only if you're a dedicated fan of this series. If you're looking for a ""full"" Tony Hawk's game, I heard he's working on a new title for this year.			"

												Judged too harshly by both the media and gamers at large, THPS HD is far from a bad game. It's nowhere near as good as the main Tony Hawk games from years past, but it gets close at times and has very few real issues. The physics can be a little bit broken, and sometimes it has frustrating collision detection, but if you pick this up on a sale you'll have a few hours of nostalgia-fueled fun. With measured expectations, THPS HD comes recommended and gets a 6/10.			"

												Controls and performs incredibly roughly. With levels and engine essentially lifted from the original games, you'd think that Robomodo could have at least gotten the physics to be half decent, but that's just asking too much of the developers of Ride and Shred. Random ramps and walls have awkward hitboxes that cause your skater to jet off in random directions.And the game doesn't even look good enough to justify the performance issues.Also, reverts locked behind paid DLC. REVERTS. The novelty was supposed to be in the levels, skaters, and feel, not in limiting the features. Speaking of limiting features, no real muliplayer to speak of. There's also a goal in the DLC that requires many of the characters to purchase a grab trick to put into their trickset, because it's not included in the standard street moveset. Remember how THPS3 had a ton of those kinds of goals, but Neversoft (RIP) were decent enough to actually only give goals for tricks that your skater already had. And even if you DO buy the trick and put it in the trickset for your skater, there's no guarantee that it will actually allow your skater to do the trick.Basically, this game is maybe worth it at 75% off. And only if you no longer have the system(s) you played the original games on, and don't want to emulate. And even then, only buy this game if you hate yourself.Then it might be worth it.			"

												Game is great. It's reliving your childhood, but in HD. Graphics are great. The grinding and manual system is more or less the same, if not better. There are several character additions, although they did remove a few as well, which disappointed me, like Andrew Reynolds. You can also be James Hetfield of Metallica. You play, earn money, collect it in levels, go to the shop, and buy either boards, stats, or tricks. There's also a special cheat area where unknown objectives in the game will unlock a cheat/mod that you can enable in the game, such as unlimited grind, or just turn your player transparant using the ""Ghost Mode."" As well as cheats, you can also unlock side-games that come when accomplishing other unknown objectives. If you have a cheat enabled, the game does not award you achievements when you accomplish something, so you need to keep them off unless you feel like randomly free skating for fun.The turning accuracy of the player has definitely improved, whereas the original would sometimes give problems, causing you to slam into things. It just wasn't as sharp.Board customization is gone, but you can change your board still, not that it means anything.The saddest thing in this is that there is no online multiplayer. It would have been really great to take on other players in runs for the highest score, like an official street skating event, or even have people in the same level as you to compete for high score. I also wish that they would include a create-a-character. I'd love to use my own self-made character rather than the forced default. I'd say overall, this remake is nearly as good as Project 8(with a few shortcomings), which I consider the best of the franchise, and this certainly surpasses all other skating games. Now that this original THPS is in HD with new model and texture rendering, it's almost like a new game. You'll never want to go back to the old versions again... now can we get Project 8 on Steam too? :)			"

												Remember when the Squid totally beefed it?Well I'm the successor to the Squid and beefing it all day every day.  But still having a blast.  Seeing how far you can strain the balance meters and chaining tricks and pulling them off is still totally fun to this day.  I've only played 1, 2 and American Wasteland, and it's been so long since I've played them.  I forgot how fun these Pro Skater games were.  Customization is still there, newer characters (with females for you fellow waifu people).  Haven't gotten too far yet, but I'm hoping the stat builder is still there as well.The levels are exactly how I remember them, updated, and look great for what it is.  Quite a handful of the original tracks like ""Saturday"", ""When Worlds Collide"" and so forth are there.  Some were axed, and some new tracks were added that aren't really favorable to me.  Those who are also wondering, which disappoints me is, there's no track selection.  So if you want a song on repeat like in the originals, you'll have to wait until the game loops them around.  It's a bummer, but I only pay attention when a favorite of mine comes on.All in all, if you've played the old Pro Skaters on PS1/N64, like usual, snag it on a sale.  Fun little quick-play type game like the originals, that you can just go in and get out.			"

												Done well:- HD face lift of classic levels- Aesthetically commendableDone poorly:- The engine- Post-release updates- Bug moderation- The soundtrack- The quality of the game for the priceRead on for a full and thorough review.A little background:I think I was proably around 6 or 7 years old when my aunt sent me Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the PS1. At the time, I think I may have been obsessed with both Tony Hawk, his franchise of games, and most of all his board company Birdhouse. I can't even remember why I started skateboarding at around the age of 5, but Tony Hawk was definitely my skateboarding idol. To be honest, I can't even remember how much I played THPS3. I played it straight for about 3 years. I don't ever recall playing any other game on my old PS1 slim. I'd beaten career mode with every single playable character, unlocked absolutely every unlockable item, and gained gold in all of the competitions. The most memorable aspect of the original THPS series were probably the soundtracks. After spending 3 years playing the game as a kid, I had learned pretty much every lyric to every song on the soundtracks. I didn't know who the artist was or what the song was called, but it you chucked the song on play today, I'd be able to sing along to it. Going back and playing the game now (I still have my PS1 copy), I noticed how stable the game's engine is. Despite the poor visuals (it WAS released in 2001), the game never felt chunky or buggy and always ran smoothly. I found this to be pretty consistent with all THPS titles, and this, coupled with Tony Hawk's fame and marketability, is what made the games so successful.Now:Fast forward 13 years. I think this was probably my first purcahse on Steam. As I had never really played on PCs before, I opted to use a controller. The controls are identical to the old layout on the PS1 and PS2 controllers - that I was happy about. After playing the games for awhile, the pushing of buttons becomes something as repetitive as changing gears in a car; you can do it quickly and without having to look down at what you're doing.I really enjoyed seeing a total facelift of the levels in the original games. During the development of the game, the original THPS engine was scrapped and a new one built. While an HD look is less important to me than the feel of the engine, the game does still look pretty nice. It gets let down by the fact that you can see textures render when you spawn. While this doesn't really affect gameplay, it just demonstrates that either this game was rushed, it had very little funding, or that they barely gave two craps when developing it.The game, as others have mentioned, it ridiculously buggy. I've found myself being thrown in the air and stretched to about four times my length while skating along flatground. I've had countless map breaks. When ollieing onto a rail to perform a grind, it's pretty common that the player will sink through the rail only to then assume the correct position. These bugs are tolerable, but when paying $15 dollars for a game, I don't expect to get something unfinished. Since I have bought the game, no updates or fixes have been implemented to attempt to fix these. It's a little disappointing that the developers pretty much abandoned the game after its first release as this could've had so much potential.I'd say the game's largest downfall is the 'soundtrack'. As this is a THPS remake, I'd expect it to be filled with the songs from the original games from artists like Alien Antfarm, The Ramones, AFI etc. Sadly, I don't recognise one song from the soundtrack. It seems poorly put together and none of the tracks flow well. Nothing about this remake's soundtrack is recogisable or memorable, and has left a bitter taste in my mouth.My advice? Sure, this game is fun to play when you're bored or hankering for a nostalgia hit. Is it worth the price? Should you get the DLC? It depnds if you are willing to pay for it, I suppose. I'd suggest you to buy it when and if it's ever on sale. I'd probably pay around 2-5 dollars for this game, not 15. My overall feelings about this game are, well, pretty ""meh"". This HD remake in no way does justice to the greatness of the original THPS series, but is an effective time passer.*If you're going to question whether the delayed loading of textures is due to my PC hardware, here's what I'm currently running.- CPU: Intel i5 4670- RAM: G.

												( This is a no for anyone that's played the originals. If you never played the originals, this game will be fine. )This game isn't BAD on it's own, but it is bad compaired to the first 2-3 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games it's supposedly remade from. Compaired to the original 2-3 THPS games:Pros:better graphicsCons: stranger physics than the originalsWorse trick connection (landing tricks)Wallrides are MUCH harder to perform due to odd physicsVERY few levels, this was AMAZINGLY dissappointing.  (the first THPS has as many levels as this has, and this is supposed to be a remake of the first 2-3 games combined.)NO MULTIPLAYER! NO ONLINE, NO LAN CONNECTION, AND NO SPLITSCREEN. This was the worst part, playing with friends was the best part of these games.(the not so bad) No character creation.Very low music, even at max (and very FEW musics, they get very repetitive)Very few characters to choose fromEverything about this seems watered down and lazy. They spent more time making the graphics better than actually making it play like it should. Everything seems like it was rushed, and they definately messed up by having no multiplayer support at all.TL;DR Game doesn't feel like THPS should, it definately doesn't play like the original 2-3, and the lack of levels and multiplayer ruined it. If you're a fan of the originals, don't get this. If you never played the originals, this game will play like a generic wacky skater game, not a bad buy for so cheap.(This is coming from a Tony Hawk game veteran, I played all 4 THPS games, both THUG games , THAW, and Project 8)			"

												So after all of 3 minutes playing this I wasted my money.  Not because it killed my childhood or anything but for the simple reasons of no remapping buttons (would basically have to re-learn how to play the thing) and no playlist editor (some bands I just don't want to hear ever).  I admittedly didn't play long enough to run in to any of the glitches or bugs that others are complaining about but the two things I mentioned alone are enough to prevent me from even trying to enjoy the rest of it.  There's also no create-a-skater or create-a-park mode for what that's worth.			"

												HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED, NO LEARDERBOARDS WTF!!!... Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was my first owned video game ever, before that I've played the crap out of the first 2 in my cousin's house. Aside from NBA JAM, this series was my favorite of all-time, from 10 million point combos to the soundtrack, it was my go-to game.. The physics and scoring system I can forgive, even the new songs, because they arent bad MINUS THE BOMB SONG WHICH IS COMPLETE♥♥♥♥♥ Now I get the online not being here sort of, due to hacking online and a small company not wanting to take a risk etc. But no leaderboards was a painful thing to realize that they don't have. I know the consoles had bad score hacking but I would rather have the idiots be on top while I compete with honest ones. I bought it because I'm no longer on consoles for the most part, so basically to me the only reason is for Achievements. The challenge in that is that I actully have to play the game.. Now to newcomers that are unforunate to be born in the modern day where everything is effed up, try it, you may catch that fun I had when I was a kid playing this on christmas with THPS3, but for veterens, if you have a console, just get that. This just is horriful.			"

												This game was developed by Robomodo instead of the original Neversoft, but it is still published by Activision. It is more of a highlight reel put together by fans of the franchise than a 100% port of the original. That being said, it is still very much Tony Hawk Pro Skater and has hours of playability.The base game has seven levels from THPS 1 & 2 (Warehouse, School II, Hangar, Mall, Venice Beach, Downhill Jam, Marseilles), and the DLC adds three huge maps from THPS 3 (Airport, LA, Canada). An awesome feature they used was that they locked all of the levels, making you play and complete the challenges in order to progress to the next stage. The hidden S-K-A-T-E's are all still in their original places, as well as the VHS's, except they have been changed to DVD's.Purchasing the DLC also adds the ability to revert during combos on all maps, allowing you to carry them for a longer amount of time. Additional content includes four new skaters: Steve Caballero, Geoff Rowley, James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo of Metallica. Most of the complaints I see are about wonky physics, but the franchise has always had wonky physics. I booted up my original THPS2 on console and it was pretty damn wonky. But that is what added to the fun and charm of the franchise, at least to me. However, there unfortunately are no multiplayer game modes, and there is also no level editor.Still highly recommended for skateboarding fans and fans of the franchise!			"

												Remember that classic, awesome skateboarding game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (and the first and third game surrounding it that were also enjoyable)? Well, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater ""HD"" upon the first cursory glance gives you the false impression that it will offer a blast to the past - at the very least a rough approximation of the gameplay that you grew up loving in those games. It does not in any way, shape or form. I seem to recall the console version being better but I have no idea for sure seeing the demo had a timer and it was about three seconds. This pile of dogshit offers the experience of bailing over and over again for no apparent reason and watching your glitchy ragdoll fly into the air like a retardad astronaut, gaining speed out of nowhere after moving at one mile per hour on your board up on to a slightly angled surface. You can very quickly rack up enough cash to upgrade your stats and they appear to have absolutely no effect whatsoever on resolving the inability to land at a slightly less than perfect angle and not fall face first into the pavement. The gameplay is in fact so poor that it is excrutiatingly difficult to pull off badass chain combos in the manner that you could in the games this one is attempting to emulate. By the time you adjust to it, you'll have lost several thousand brain cells. Do yourself a favor and go pick up a used copy of Project 8 or American Wasteland - the last two real Tony Hawk games by Neversoft with extremely solid, crisp gameplay. This is absolutely worthless.In other words, this game ♥♥♥♥ing SUCKS.			"

												If you're like I was and are jonesing for some Tony Hawk's Pro Skater gameplay after not having a console around for many years, then this game will sort of fill the void (at least for a short time). The physics situation in this version is straight up atrocious, with completely ridiculous bails where your body will fly in the exact opposite direction it should. The skating isn't nearly as smooth as THPS3 or 4 (my personal favorites) and feels more like the N64 versions with just better graphics. Another issue that is just absurd, is landing in vert. To get a perfect landing, it only looks to see if you land at the exact same angle that you took off, which makes no sense if you are traversing a gap horizontally. Terrible.The maps don't feel alive, there is a distinct lack of atmosphere with little or no NPCs around.If you can grab it on sale and really need a THPS fix, then go for it. But make sure you have a controller because it's awful to play with a keyboard. At full price I wouldn't recommend. So my ""Yes I would recommend"" is more like a ""yes, but only if you realllllly miss THPS.""			"

												THPS HD is a lot of fun to pick up and play. The engine holds up well enough, running smooth and bugless the entire time, despite some of it's bizzaro physics during bails (which in my oppinion add to its unique charm!). The sound track is decent enough, but you will find it repeating fairly often, not much you can do about that. For the asking price, I would highly recommend giving it a try! I definately enjoyed playing it through to completion. :) I would also recommend playing with a gamepad.			"

												It's very rare that a game comes along that I can get lost in... those games can bring you back to being a child and allow you just leave behind the day to day of your life for just a moment as you reconnect with what it means to be akid and just have a good time tearing up some video games. You turn on a hugely anticipated HD remake, hear those familiar tunes that were once lost the corners of your mind, grab Bob Burnquist... my favorite skater :-)... and let muscle memory shift into overdrive as you find yourself shredding the pavement. I could imagine myself almost feeling hte wind soaring through my hair as I pulled off stunts thatnobody oculd even fathom, tkaing skateboarding to heights it's never been.Well... this is not that game. This piece of flaming garbage is nothing like the name suggests. The graphics are worse than my ED, the controls are looser than my teeth, and skate roster is barer than my nuts. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is Bob Burnquist, Tony? Is Chad Muska hanging out wiht him because I don't him either, Tony? Nobody wants to play as Riley Hawk, Tony. Wanna know how many people even ♥♥♥♥ing know who Riley Hawk is, Tony? I don't have a number in mind, but I'm sure it's low as hell, Tony.In short, ♥♥♥♥ing Tony Hawk and ♥♥♥♥ the Free World. #313forlife			"

												So I've spent hours/days playing and mastering THUG and THUG2. When I picked this game up I thought I was in for more hours of entertainment. Unfortunatly the physics in this game are pretty awful. I'll wipe out on nothing after getting air on a halfpipe. Tony Hawk games have never been known for their realistic phsyics but it's frustrating when you crash in this game because the game glitched out. My advice is to go plug your Xbox or PS2 in, find your copy of THUG(2) and actually enjoy the experiance rather than waste your money here. And whose brilliant idea was it to make reverts a DLC. That's pretty awful in my opinion. To sum things up if you love Tony Hawk, just pass on this one. It is buggy and frustrating to play.			"

												I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS)1 & 2  when I was a child on my N64, I missed playing these games and once I saw this game on steam I rushed to buy it. Once I bought the game I was ready to relive these maps the ones I spend countless hours playing I spent hours mastering every trick, map and exploits. When the time came to play the game i was filled with nostalgia i felt like a kid again but once reality finaly hit i found nothing about this game was nearly same this game lacks what the original THPS 1 & 2 had this game is horrific. This game has countless flaws picking up speed once your on the floor is terrible, grinding it's okay but needs help, hitboxes are off, you fall off the board for senseless reasons, and ect . Tony Hawk's Pro Skater -HD is amateurish, clunky, unpolished, and  embarrasment to the franchise. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

Like split screen, create a skater and good gameplay.I'm not angry, just very, very disappointed.Just insert the 10 dollars that you were going to spend on this game, into your own♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's about the same experience.Thanks for destorying my childhood.

												I remeber playing the original Tony Hawk games as a kid and it was one of the first games I have ever played as a kid and I still remeber the fond memories of the games to this day. The moment I saw that the games were going to be remade in HD I freaked out and I was so hyped to play the games and relive some good memories. This game seriously delivered with some pretty good controls, excellent graphics, fantastic soundtrack, and generally brings back nostalgia. This game has tons of replay value if you want to max the stats out of your skaters or just beat career mode over and over again. I've done that and it is so fun to play the original Tony Hawk games again.Although this game was good, there was some flaws that really stand out. The fact that create-a-skater is gone and some other cool unlocks are gone (like Spiderman in THPS2). They dont have 2-player splitscreen or even creating a park isn't even here. There are also game glitches and clipping that is really bothersome to me. Some players have argued that there is a restriction on resolutions that you have to edit it in the games files for it to fit their proper resolutions which is a problem.Those things aside, I highly recommend this game if you've played the three Tony Hawk's Pro Skaters and want to play the levels again in HD. I give this game a 9.5/10 because the complaints I've given are minor and don't really relate to me and I love the nostalgic value this game has given me.			"

												this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I used to play THUG 2 and THPS 3 for years when I was little. I always loved competing against my brother and trying to get a bigger combo than him (we played loser for days) but this game... it just feels wrong to play it. The engine is complete mess. The physics are weird and u just bounce of the floor and everything is weird. In addition to that I can't get a high combo on that game, no matter what I try, although I still have no problems getting a 1 Million+ combo going on THPS3. In addition to that the whole game seems to be way to slow and many tricks don't work the way they should (for example the wallride, where I either get lifted way to far up in the air and then get reseted or just grind on a nearby rail). tl;dr this game is a mess, play THPS3,UG2, or anything which was released before this piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												Yeah...I mean, it's okay. I wasn't really expecting it to be an exact port, or anything, but I did expect a litle more...effort to be put into it? I don't know. I only spent like $8 on it, so it's not a total loss. The bad psyhics kind of ruin it, but that's just me. It's probably because I'm just remembering HOW GOOD it was back on Xbox. There's too many let downs for me to recommend it, however. For one: the psyhics. The bailing animation is...bad. Also, the fact that it offers no controller explantion? Did they REALLY expect people to play a SKATING GAME with a KEYBOARD and MOUSE??? I didn't think so, but apparently they did. I REALLY wish I still had my Xbox, in all honesty. Maybe I could emulate it...Anyways. It has nice graphics and music, but I'd seriously tell you to not get it at full price. It might be one of the rare times...where...I kind of want a refund. If you ever (which is HIGHLY UNLIKELY) get the chance to play the orginal ones on an Xbox, do it. I bet (I KNOW) it'd be a LOT better. I've played some pretty bad remakes, so this is rather dissapointing. I...guess, if you want, get it on sale, I wouldn't recommend it though. There exists Tony Haw: Proving Ground for the Wii, that is REALLY good except for the Wiimote controls. Just go get that. It's more expensive, but it would be 10x the fun as...this.			"

												Don't ever make the mistake of buying this. It's a complete waste of money, even at 75% off. The Developers have never fixed any of the glaring flaws with the physics, controls, or the implementation of ragdoll physiscs because they do not care at all about the experience of the gamer. This game is proof that all Activision is after anymore is capitalizing on the nostalgia of gamers because all they have left to work with is the memories of their glory days. They've lost all of their talent, and are run by CEO's who see you for the dollars in your wallet and nothing more. If this game had launched after the refund system became available, I wouldn't have to look at it in my library anymore. Just like Breach, it has managed to dissapoint and break immersion every single time I open it up.			"

												Play Underground 2 or American Wasteland on an emulator.  Trust me.  Just do it.  Forget graphics, forget slightly better physics.  It doesn't matter.  This game is so lacking in content and so short that I can't believe it even exists.  How could a game as open, free and creative as Underground 2 exist when something like this came ten years after?  It is made by different people, but REALLY.  This is a bad joke.  You can't make a game in a series that is 15 years old and give it less content that the 3rd game had.  Yes, Pro Skater 3 is about twice as good as this game.  I'm not joking.  I've played Tony Hawk games my entire life and these past few games are like a bad dream.  I can't wrap my head around this game being real when it doesn't have create-a-skater, park editor, trick editor, 1/8 of the tricks of even underground 1, and nothing to do expect classic 2:00 mode.  I fear for the game industry if anyone really thinks products like this are acceptable.  This game should have been a demo for the real game, which would have been 10 times better.			"

												I have mixed feelings regarding this game. While I don't remember the old THPS games too well, I can easily say there's plenty of stuff missing in this HD version. The worst part is lack of multiplayer, it could make the game so much more fan if you could compete online against other people... Also, I've been encountering some occasional glitches that I don't remember ever happening in the old games. Still, I do feel like recommending this game, because I don't think there's a better skating game for a PC out there. It made me feel a bit nostalgic and brought up some good memories. It's highly recommended to own an xbox controller to play this, but I believe you can manage to play on a keyboard just fine.			"

It'll ruin your memories of the original and if you didn't play the original you'll be ruined on the series in general. Get the PS1 version and be MUCH happier.

												This game is somewhat enjoyable, but it seriously lacks something. There isn't really a storyline, which this game series really needs more of, and the overall game is rather dissapointingly short. The gameplay is rough especially it's 'accurate' physics and the slightest bit off of landing will send you sprawling to the ground bleeding, which is infuriating, and outside of the the physics, you can't modify the controls as for which button is asigned to which and is hard to accomodate. The praphics/asthetics are weak and could use some major redoing if they decide to ever republish this game. So overall, this game was a letdown and not one which I would recommend getting. I would rate this game as a 4 out of 10.			"

												This game is somewhat enjoyable, but it seriously lacks something. There isn't really a storyline, which this game series really needs more of, and the overall game is rather dissapointingly short. The gameplay is rough especially it's 'accurate' physics and the slightest bit off of landing will send you sprawling to the ground bleeding, which is infuriating, and outside of the the physics, you can't modify the controls as for which button is asigned to which and is hard to accomodate. The praphics/asthetics are weak and could use some major redoing if they decide to ever republish this game. So overall, this game was a letdown and not one which I would recommend getting. I would rate this game as a 4 out of 10.			"

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is a good game (and a fine remake).To address some of the issues that appear in the negative reviews :- Poor Control. This was an issue that I had when first playing the game with my Logitech Dual Action. The game remained 'playable', however the game had issues when the imputs occured too quickly. Later on I switched to using a Dualshock 3 with ScpServer and have had no issues since (having no problem with clearing all objectives, I refuse to acknowledge 'poor control' as a reason to dismiss this game).-  Bugs	. Occasionally I have seen some graphical bugs with the textures, as they become blurry for brief moments during gameplay. While I understand that graphical bugs can defeat the purpose of an 'HD remake' for some, please note that this issue rarely occured and had no effect the gameplay itself. Another bug is the result of wonky crash physics that sometimes cause the character to ragdoll or bounce upon wipeout. While some might think this as a bug, it is only experienced once the character has fallen and broken their trick combo. Rest assured that these bugs are only a minor annoyance and will not affect your performance in doing tricks or completing objectives.- No Multiplayer	. Yeah, I can agree that this sucks. Seeing as how multiplayer was in the ps3/360 port, I don't know why It wasn't implemented in the PC version. I would hope for a multiplayer mod, but it's unlikely that will ever happen.-  Waah my nostalgia!. Despite the game only containing a few levels from each of the THPS 1-3 games, it remains unchanged from the original games despite the graphical improvements (as an 'HD remake' should have). The music, level design, objectives, skaters and boards are all the same (with the expection of the secret area inside the school not being available. If you can't experience nostalgia here then it seems you might not have had any experience with the original games at all, or your 'nostalgia' has limited you from enjoying this game.The game also provides plenty of extra game modes that the original games did not, allowing for extended replay value. I had a blast playing this game and could reccomend to anyone looking to play THPS in HD.			"

												If you don't pay too much for it, I would recommend this game.There are a lot of negative aspects about it, but I base my review 1.) on the fun I had while playing career mode, unlocking skills and boards, experiencing all the good old locations and listening to the 90s-skate-soundtrack and2.) the nostalgia I felt and the memories that came to my mind.I played with keyboard.

												This game is terrible. Even at first glance it looks like quick console port. It contains with many bugs and ill solutions. The major con is poor posibility to change options. Graphics options don't exist - you can only change resolution. But what annoyed me the most is that I couldn't change default control settings, which are horrible. Seriously, in this game you jump using Space Button! Luckily, I changed it in some config files. Unacceptable are bugs in some levels from DLC. But I can praise quite good looking graphics and music, which is OK. Pros:-Quite good music and graphics-Variety of skatersCons: -Horrible controls (on keyboard), which are hard to change-Many bugs in levels-Game is not as dynamic as previous games in Tony Hawk's series-Poor settings-Only option in graphics section (resolution) doesn't work correctly-High priceTo sum up, I wouldn't recommend this game, especially in normal price. I will apply for refund.			"

												Alright so as some of you know, the Tony Hawk series has sucked from American Wasteland and with this game was supposed to help the series but it didn't exactly.There are many glitches in the game (like the wallride glitch) and the mechanics aren't exactly the best. Also this game would've been a lot better if it hard local (or even any) multiplayer.However the levels are amazing, the soundtrack is pretty good and you will get a few hours out of it. Though if you want a bit more I recommend getting the DLC.In conclusion I recommend this game to those who would want to play a skateboarding game on steam. If you want to play a good one I recommend you grab Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 or something (I would say THUG but that's hard to find)			"

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater® HD: Not the same, but is that really a bad thing?The original Tony Hawks in no means had any form of realism involved, infact It was more of an Arcade-like high scoring game in which you tried to beat your best combo every time you played. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD brings a new engine into play where you will start to think the game is simply buggy or broken. This game took me around 45 minutes until I started hitting sick combos like I did back in the day with Underground. I can now say that I am enjoying this game for what it is, a revitalized Tony Hawk game with a better engine. Now with a new engine comes a lot of problems. I started realizing very quickly that when you try to flip trick off certain rails, you bail 90% of the time. These rails I have now marked down in my head and I now simply ollie off them into a manual to make up for the loss of points. If you never played a Tony Hawk game then this is not a big deal, but for me that is lost points on a line I had going, and it will make you highly upset when you bail off of a highscore. The challenge system makes you unlock all the maps in career mode. You must complete set amount of challenges to unlock new maps. I have already unlocked majority and it is great to see classic maps placed in there purest form. I still remember all the old warehouse tricklines that I was able to do back in the day. Final Verdict:This game is not the same as all the previous classic Tony Hawk games. But for someone who is new to the series, this is a good start. If you want to re-visit older Tony Hawk games, you will begin to apreciate everything this new installment has taught you. I went back to unerground yesterday and I felt better then I was when I played it at 15. 7/10 - The fact that I cant perfectly land lines that I was able to do before really upsets me. But really this will be great for anyone who wants to give the Tony Hawks franchise a shot. It will take you a while but soon you will be getting 500,000 plus score on every map. "

												Отличное HD переиздание на несколько вечеров. Опять же, почему при выходе все ругались и плевались не понятно, ведь переиздание гораздо лучше, чем 3 последние игры от Тони, которые с каждой последующей, катились всё ниже и ниже. Графика весьма на уровне, не режет глаза, а физика, практически один в один с 1-ой Playstation, что лично для меня - огромный плюс! Кататься так же приятно, как и 15 лет назад, взял в руки джой и через 5 минут уже комбо под 100-200 тысяч навертел, это как ездить на велосипеде, если научился, никогда уже не разучишься.Но когда-то, серия была на пике славы, особенно первые 4 номерных части, от них игре и достался почти весь контент  -  уровни, но добавили маловато, в основном из первой и второй, и то, только самые популярные этапы.Какое-то время ждал DLC, вышло только одно, опять же с парой уровней, печально. Почему нельзя было издать старые игры полностью, в нормальном разрешение да с ачивками, не понятно. В итоге кушаем солянку, да не полную миску, а половину. Покататься, трюки вспомнить, понастальгировать, самое оно. В остальном - всё как в стареньких ТХ, набери очки, гринд над платформой, собери слово скейт и т.д. Был удивлён новой, приятной музыкой в саундтреке, добавил пару песен в плейлист, мой фаворит Middle Class Rut – USA.Без геймпада даже не включайте!Оценка 8 + Если вам понравился обзор, подписывайтесь на мою кураторскую страничку, где я постоянно пишу и рекомендую самые разные игры!

												damn, only 61% of the players rated this game positively? I mean ♥♥♥♥ it's not as good as THPS 2 or 3, but stop comparing it to those two games, if you want to play a classic buy a PS2 or Xboxconsoles have better skateboarding games, but this is the best one on pc by far unless you're in to that Shaun White Skateboarding♥♥♥♥♥♥ "

												Unless you like dissapointments, or this game is on sale for less than €/$5, don't buy this. The developers tried hard to remake the classic (THPS2) using new shaders and HD textures. They forgot to add working psysics. Feels almost as bad as THPS5.			"

												Not what I was hoping for. The Tony Hawk's series has had a steady decline in quality over the past years and this HD remake was supposed to bring back life to the games. However, it really fails at that. The only thing this game offers is a graphical update of some old, classic Tony Hawk's levels (and some, which suck...seriously? Downhill Jam?) but fails to deliver a good interpretation of the old-school gameplay. Firstly, the physics are a mess. I'm not sure if they tried to blend arcade and realistic gameplay but a lot of the time you find yourself bailing in situations that would be a normal, if somewhat sketchy, landing in previous games. Yes, in real life if you landed like that you would eat a good serving of concrete but not in an old-school Tony Hawk game. We have the EA Skate series for realistic skateboarding frustration, we didn't need that in an arcade skateboarding game. Something else I found awful were the insane difficulty spikes and declines. Of course, this could be contributed to my complete lack of gaming skill but it just feels like they randomly picked some levels and threw them in there in no particular order.My biggest gripe - NO MULTIPLAYER! Not even local multiplayer, let alone online. And this is a big problem, because while the game is mediocre if could have been pretty fun with some people around.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD has 3 good things in it - a pretty good soundtrack, the warehouse level and Chris Cole. Other than that, you're better off getting one of the old games for that nostalgic kick we all need. Only get this if it's stupidly cheap in a sale. It's a good recreation of the originl games' look but it fails at what's most important - making the skateboarding gameplay fun.			"

												Okay so I saw all the bad reviews for this game and watching it on youtube doesnt do me justice at all so I decided to buy the game and try it out because I am a big fan of playing THPS 2 on N64. Its not going to be good...1. Lack of character varietyIf you played all the games then you would know that this character list is barely half of what THPS2 was which doesnt make sense to not put in everyone but thats how it was.2. PHYSICSThis game is apparently ""Real"" meaning you dont get insane air or go really fast when you start doing tricks which is a HUGE downer because THPS was a fast paced game and this game is the opposite. Its more like a real skate game where you cant chain multiple moves like crazy but instead be more careful of overdoing it which isnt fun at all. I do not like the new gravity or physics or whatever makes this game so slow and heavy.3. No career mode?THPS2 had a good career mode where it made you feel like you unlocked something new but instead its just ""Do this and that and now the next level and do this and that repeat"" its boring and not immersive at all and also frustration because of how the game plays and feels. Its not like the old games at all.4. Music??This is a modern game and yet back in the 90's they had the technology to select the track you wanted to play in the game yet in this modern game you cant select the music.... enough said5. Levels??Wheres new york or philly or Mexico??? This game should have everything of all the games combined but its just a sloppy creation of nothing special.6. Playing the gameOverall, I didnt enjoy this for the time I played it for. I tried to complete all goals for the next stage and nothing happened at the last staged and I do not want to 100% with how bad the game controls and feels. I cannot find any positives other than it looks OKAY but not great at all.I most likely wont play this again and if you want a 100% choice on to buy this game or not. Dont buy it and get some cool indie game instead.			"

												Wow what can i say here. This is a really faithful rendition of the classic tony hawk games before they decided to become really really gay. When i say really gay, I mean the series became gayer than Macklemore was in the third grade. Seriously bro when i want to play tony hawk i dont want to have to use a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skateboard peripheral. Any person that liked Tony Hawk ride prolly ate paste and rode the short bus to school. Like honestly if you want to feel the very same nostalgia that you had while playing the Pizza Hut THPS demo disk from when you were in grade school this is the game for you. Also if you're whining about there being no multiplayer youre a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turbonerd that needs to have his lunch money taken from him. PROS:Its not Tony Hawk rideYou dont need a skateboard peripheralIts not Tony Hawk ride (again)Has Tony Hawk in itCons:Tony Hawk is still not my dadOverall 4/5			"

												It's really only a shell of what it was on the Playstation and Xbox and could have been a lot more than it is, but it's still the good old Tony Hawk formula from back in 2000. Barely any customisation, unfortunately, but otherwise has all of your favorite TH1 and 2 maps as well as the classic soundtrack, though you can't edit it.			"

												Tony Hawk's Pro Scater HD is a good remake of 1st and 2nd game in the series as it brings back those old times when these games rocked so much. You can choose from Tony Hawk himself and other great scaters to play on different skating tracks. There are alot of cool moves you can do as well as buy new ones with money you earn doing some challenges for 7 maps. It's all old school arcade style gameplay. You can perform different acrobatic moves and earn points but if you crash you will lose all your combo. There are also some other modes to play but they are not so entertaining. The soundtrack is great adn never bores at all. Although there is no ""Create a Park"" feature as were in some other games so you have only 7 different tracks from old games and Post dlc will add a bit more from 3rd game. Final word goes to PC port. It's done bad adn no video settings. All in all it's a good blast from the past, but better experience is on consoles. 6/10			"

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is a high-definition re-release featuring classic levels and music from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, with the DLC you will also have access to some levels of THPS 3.THPSHD looks great, the levels and characters are upgraded with sharp visuals and fresh content. The gameplay has been left almost completely untouched, but the Levels feel just a little different (not better or worse).The game has no option to change the key bindings, you have to edit some ini files with an editor to get a good controlling. It's also missing many key features from old THPS games, like a level editor or a character creator.There’s no local multiplayer and unlike the XBOX version, the PC version also has no online multiplayer.There are also some technical issues, like sometimes your character falls down for no reason or clipping issues are also present; it is possible to fall through a level.Sound 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												A lot of people have a bad oppinion on this game. Sincerely, this game is really cool. Skating games were always extremely fun to play, even though, I havn't experienced multiplayer wich I am sure it's fun. Tony Hawk's Pro Skate HD has no multiplayer mode you can play on, doesn't have a story like the other Tony Hawk's Pro Skater/Tony Hawk's games. For example: Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Underground, The Pro Skater games, were extremely good. I played them on PS2. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is just career, free skate, and like 3 more gamemodes that I don't really find interesting. It is pretty diferent and ♥♥♥♥ed from the last games, but, it is worth a try. It is only 10 euros and it's fun in my oppinion. Combos, are pretty hard to do. Conclusion: Buy it, I hope you like it, if not, refund it. Have fun :)			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic.  For lovers of Tony hawk 1, 2 and the PS1 versions of 3 and 4 - This game is for you! The physics and animations are smooth and PC runs at a solid 60. The game is vert vibrant and the upscale looks great.For people who want to purchase this game, get it on PS3 (Preferred) or X360. The PC version does not support online and has a good bit of controller problems. You will only get 60FPS.The soundtrack is intact for the most part with the additions of Flyentology and Lateef the truth speaker. Very nice mix.The balance meter its perfect. Easy to balance and hold combos. Feels just like pro skater 2.9/10 Definitely buy this game.  The only downside is the PC port.			"

												Please ignore the negative reviews. I really cannot understand where these people are coming from. In fact, a lot of them have < 1 hour playtime so I am not sure their opinions are relevant. I played THS, THPS2 and THPS3 back when they released on PS1 and this is a great way to revisit those games. They have really captured the feel of them. With the remastering it is like you are playing both a new game and the game you grew up loving.This features some of the classic tracks from the originals, all my favourites at least. Warehouse, Hangar, School II, Marseille etc.There is a DLC with THPS3 tracks on too like Canada and LA. Which brings me to another point. All the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about revert being included as a DLC when it ""should have been in from the start"". This game was originally a remastering of the first 2 games. Not 3. Revert was not in the first 2 games. But you probably didn't actually play the originals. The developers bowed to the beggars and whiners and released revert in the DLC and were good enough to release 3 THPS3 traks with it and the price isn't outlandish like a lot of other DLC out there. Yes there's no track creator but there is a host of brand new game modes, all of which are pretty damn fun.If I could give it one criticism it's that split-screen multiplayer would have been great. But that by no means qualifies this as a bad game. Look at the sidebar over there, it says Single-player, you know what you're getting going in.The soundtrack is as amazing as ever, No Cigar, You, May 16, all my personal favourites from the original games as well as a few welcome additions.Ignore the babies. If you liked the original you'll like this.P.S. I have been playing with a controller and this review is based on that play. I cannot speak for M+K controls.			"

												When reading this review, please be aware that I only feel this way because I'm an old school Tony Hawk's player. If you haven't played any Tony Hawk-games before, this review isn't necessarily for you.So, I really don't have that much to say about this game. I didn't even have to play it for more than 6 minutes to realize it wasn't anything I had thought about. Basically the only Tony Hawk-games I've played are Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 Demo. Now those games were certainly a whole bunch of fun to play, as their game mechanics were awesome. Those games, of course on todays standards, are buggy games with poor graphics. This is the reason why I thought 'hey, this game looks like an improved version of the other Tony Hawk-games'. Oh boy was i wrong. The game mechanics are utter crap, and indeed, the only thing improved are the graphics. I would honestly choose American Wasteland over this new school version any time.2/10			"

												Instead of beating the dead horse that is skateboarding games Tony Hawk has gone back to basics with a remake of the original game to carry pro skater title. While everything bad about the newest games has been removed of course so were some of the improvements. Grinds & manuals can no longer be augmented mid trick and the segways from vertical to ground tricks are absent as well. Aside from a few minor changes and an HD repainting it's the same N64 classic you knew and loved (with an unfortunate reminder of downhill jam by a map of the same name to make sure too much fun isn't had).All in all it's a great piece of retro revival from a genre that was killed by those that made it popular. If you enjoyed this game fifteen years ago it's still as much fun today even if it does boil down to little more than a rerelease. If you're feeling nostalgic it's a great play as long as you don't expect much more than the original delivered.			"

												I'd like to recommend this but integrity and all that jazz gets in the way.Easily the worst game of the franchise; lacks features present in just about every other, older, game (multiplayer, create-a-skater, etc.) and what is there is lazily designed (like the missing careers trailers or the inability to check what track is playing, skip it, etc. - no doubt in an attempt to hide there are about 8 tracks in total)And dont get me started on the dlc; a fiver to revert, for reals?Sure, people will bang on about nostalgia but the physics are so different I dont even feel like I'm playing the older games. If anything this game is just ruining great memories. If, like me, you no longer have a console to get you through the THPS cravings then just go get some roms of the series instead; their free, their better, and if your pc can run this then it can run a ps emulator.

												Don't waste your money on this game. It's nowhere near as good as the older games of the THPS franchise. you pretty much have to have a controller in order to be able to play this game. the keyboard controls are awful, and there is no option for re-mapping the buttons on your controller. the game is filled with glitches and bugs, the skateboardes are slow and clumsy. there is no map or character creator included. I wouldn't recommend this game for anybody.			"

												TL;DR: I don't really recommend it because it doesn't even live upto the standards of 12 years ago. The physics and board handling are pretty dire for a modern skateboarding simulation game.I have been a fan of the Tony Hawk's games since the early 2000's when I first got my hands on the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (or Tony Hawk's Skateboarding as it was known in the UK and other PAL regions)  back in roughly 2000. I have played every PlayStation instalment since the first game with the exception of the HD games and the motion controlled Ride and Shred games.Recently I have been emulating the hell out of all these games using PCSX2 here on my PC and FPSE on my OUYA so I can make direct comparisons here and not rely on 10 year old memories. These games are older and they are outright better.Once you get over the questionable menu and HUD design (is Clarendon really the most appropriate typeface for the UI here?), no XBOX button prompts when using a gamepad,  the lack of some of my favourite pro skaters (no Chad Muska or  Mike Vallely) and most importantly the game's physics and board handling.The physics and board handling really let me down, that is to me the most important parts of any skateboard simulation game out there. I will tell you the game handles a lot like Grind Session did back in 2000. Between the ollies, grinding and the bails. It feels like a game from 14-15 years ago gameplay wise.  As for the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, 3 and 4 which this game is designed to pay homage to, they handle so much better and they are so much older. Don't believe me, give them a whirl. If you can get over the outdated graphics, the gameplay is still very solid on those games.There are a few positives though.  First off, the game's UI while being hit and miss, does make a few hits. I like the addition of a level map in the pause menu, although it isn't that useful when I have played all of the levels so many times in the past (there are NO original levels in this game). Also I like the progress meter for the goals which is think is pretty sleek in this version. I like how it greys out the missing SKATE letters.Also the graphics and visual effects are pretty nice, helped by the power of the Unreal Engine 3. It is interesting to see old levels that haven't had a modern graphical update for the last decade get some love, I like daylight effects used in the Warehouse level and I like the addition of a dome in the Mall level from THPS, it's a nice touch.Also I love the soundtrack. A few of the classics from the original THPS games have made it to the game's OST including Millencolin - No Cigar, Public Enemy feat. - Bring the Noise and Powerman 5000 - When World's Collide. They always sound great, classic songs. In addition there are new songs too to make a nice balanced playlist.The addition of achievements ,albeit just 15 is a nice addition and will definitely motivate me to continue playing this game for some time.  I'll see how many I'll get before I am bored.Finally the lack of multiplayer is understandable for a $9.99 (£8.99) title. It would have been a nice addition to play these levels with local or online multiplayer with game modes like Horse, Free Skate and Graffiti. But I don't blame Robomodo for omitting it, probably due to time and budget restraints.To conclude, the game just doesn't handle well enough to give me a nostalgia kick. It irritates me more than it excites me. I guess it's up to Neversoft to make a solid Tony Hawk game like they did in the past all the way up to Project 8 (which was alright). This game doesn't get a recommendation from me, because the other games emulate perfectly and you should be playing them instead.			"

												You might be better of finding a cheap PS2 and getting one of the ""newer"" THPS.  I just don't really care for the feel of this for some reason - and the bare bones graphic options.   Maybe it will grow on me, but my inital feeling is that I wouldn't recommend.			"

The keyboard controls are confusing, and they didn't even bother to add stuff from the new games liek Spine Transfers. I get that you want to remake THPS, but you still need to upgrade it besides the graphics. I do not reccomend this game unless you have a gamepad, and even then it's not that great.			"

												As an HD remake, this mashup of THPS1&2 makes everything much smoother and prettier while still keeping gameplay the same. In addition to Career and Free Skate mode, it adds Projectives, Bighead Endurance, and Hawkman modes to lengthen the lives of the admittedly short level list. More levels, characters, and moves are coming in the THPS3 DLC.Sadly, there are no create-a-modes. There are also very few PC customization options in-game, requiring you to look up how to change settings online through the game's text files.It's a great start, though it'll need a few DLC to match the amount of content we've come to expect from Tony Hawk games. Now, if only we could get this hooked up to the Steam Workshop and creative tools, we'd have an untapped goldmine on our hands. That, and expanding the short soundtrack / adding the option for user tracks.I'm having great fun kicking my old scores to the curb btw.			"

												Being a fan of the THPS series for Playstation as a kid growing up a good 14 years ago, I can't even express how excited I was to see this being released. It's bringing back so many memories. Once I finish this here, I'll probably dog out my old PS1 disk and give it a go again. It's been about 3 years now since I last played THPS2.- GREAT improvement in maps graphics and details. Changes from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 have been made, so I noticed in the Hanger level (so far I'm only at lv2), that the hidden room with the helicopter isn't there (at least, not that I've found yet. Still trying to get used to playing this on laptop and not with a controller... wallrides are tricky for me on here).- Different skaters to play as, new and old. Including Hawk's son, Riley.- Classic game modes. Collect S-K-A-T-E etc.- Selected music from THPS2 with some new additions. The soundtrack is just overall fantastic.Recommended to any fan of the series.			"

Fluid controls, relaxing gameplay, and a lovely soundtrack that makes you nostalgia all over your keyboard. If you've ever played any of the original Tony Hawks you will love this. Get a gamepad and take a trip down memory lane with this solid recomendation.			"

												Really fun. Feels and plays like the original series of THPS's but looks very modern. If you loved the originals it is a must to add to your collection.There are certain characters (Officer♥♥♥♥♥♥and Rodney Mullen ive noticed so far) they did not fine tune for the maps though, witch makes the game glitchy... Really wish they would fix these things.. Suggested to grab the soundtracks of the originals and play in background to produce even greater nostalgia.Overall for price and fun ive had with the game I would definitely buy it again, as well as any future expansions if they are released.

												As an HD remake, this mashup of THPS1&2 makes everything much smoother and prettier while still keeping gameplay the same. In addition to Career and Free Skate mode, it adds Projectives, Bighead Endurance, and Hawkman modes to lengthen the lives of the admittedly short level list. More levels, characters, and moves are coming in the THPS3 DLC.Sadly, there are no create-a-modes. There are also very few PC customization options in-game, requiring you to look up how to change settings online through the game's text files.It's a great start, though it'll need a few DLC to match the amount of content we've come to expect from Tony Hawk games. Now, if only we could get this hooked up to the Steam Workshop and creative tools, we'd have an untapped goldmine on our hands. That, and expanding the short soundtrack / adding the option for user tracks.I'm having great fun kicking my old scores to the curb btw.			"

												Pretty good game depending on who's playing it. Somone new to the series would most likely enjoy this remake but others familiar with the original series tony hawk's pro skater 1,2,3,4 and THUG series would most likely be disappointed. The game is more of a remake of 1,2,3,4 on a new engine with missing essential elements to the original series. Acid drops, spine transfers, manual tricks  (EX truckstand, casper) are completly missing. Players also looking for the THUG experience with a new story should stay away from this game or expect less. Setting options are also a downside to this game. Not having any other settings is also a downside. This clearly show's the game is a straight console port looking exactly like the PS3 version. This is not a real downside but being the PC version I expected a bit more. Also the sound setting for the Effects are completly broken I found my self turning down the SFX volume yet having the sound effects of Cars and breaking object completly blasting my ears even with everything else turned down. Ended up turning off the sound manualy in windows. Speaking of sound berely having any tracks may cause some people to just mute their in game music and play their own which is what I do but for $10 bucks its unexceptable. Also older Tony Hawk games like pro skater 4 and Underground having legendary sound tracks I expected more from this remake. Over all its an Okay game 7/10. Maybe worth $10 to some but for me its worth like $5 bucks which is what I got it for during the summer sale.			"

												Not a good game. Awful collision detection and controls combine to give some of the glitchiest and least fun gameplay iv'e encountered in a skateboarding game. When the old games for PS1 that this game is supposed to be homage to are better, then you know there's something wrong with your game. The only reason I could think of for buying this is for the nostalgia feel, and for that you'd be better off getting a PS1 emulator and playing the older games anyway. This is not worth money, if you really want to play it, download it elsewhere.			"

												It's awesome to see such a classic game brought to Steam. Brings me back to the days of my Ps2 :') The soundtrack is amazing and to be completely honest, the game would be nothing without it. However, I do have one complaint. This game was built to be played with a controller which is why the controls are absolute trash on keyboard. The keyboard controls feel awkward and almost unplayable with and it's without the choice to set your own controls in-game, I'd only recommend this game to people who have a controller ready.			"

												Took me 5 hours to 100% Every level has existed for more than a decade and almost every person who bought THPS HD did it because they've spent thousands of hours with almost every Tony Hawk game in the past... I've been playing THPS since the first one on PS1 and have picked up every other sequel as time went on... THPS HD is just lazy, there is very little content and the content that is in here is sometimes broken, there are a lot of clipping issues, you will hear the same 10 songs over and over again - this was acceptable back in PS1/N64 era but now it's just unforgivable, also you can't even create your own skater - something that has been in every Tony Hawk game since the beginning. No wonder THPS 5 has a rating of 4.0 - Robomodo are lazy idiots who have no idea what THPS is/was.			"

												A simple blast from the past, that can help you kill chucks of time.As they tried to add a few new modes to help keep these old levels feeling fresh, you can not escape these are limited maps with limited move sets. The Revert move is included with DLC which means more money for needed longer combos. Trying to string long combos together is unpolished, and often a mess of improperly read move inputs. Overall for a memory trip and something to fill gaps of time, its ok to free stake and remember when these games pushed the boundries of a skateboarding game, but in all they don't stand well on their own and show what an empty shell this ones powerhouse used to be.

												I don't understand why Tony Hawk Proskater HD gets so much hate.This game took me waaaay back to the late 90's/early 2000's era, and had absolute fun with it.The game modes were amazing and just like how I remembered. The game ran in beautiful 60fps on unreal engine. I really enjoyed how crisp the animations were when doing grabs, tricks, jumps etc. It was very realistic, yet unreleastic to follow the theme of the original Tony Hawk Proskater series.The only two problems I had with it was its lack of ""online mode"" which wasn't featured in the PC port apparently, and the ragdoll when falling off the board. Overall it was still fun for the single player experience + the unlockables. Playing this just revs up my hype for Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5 which is coming out later this year.To be fair though, I wouldn't recommend buying this if you plan getting Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5.			"

												One of the great things that made Tony Hawk games awesome was the soundtrack, especially for the first. While some of the classics do make a return, the soundtrack isn't what it once was. The roster is updated with new skaters, but some of the old ones didn't make it. I mainly bought this game for nostalgia, but so much has changed that it doesn't bring back those good memories. Also, PC port is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. No options, no multiplayer, no controller controls listings, no specials that I could find. If you're thinking about it, go buy a playstation and play the original.

However, even though the HD reskin looks decent enough, there are new glitches present and not enough content to satisfy. I wish they had just opted to port Pro Skater 2X over instead. Also, you have to go into the ini file to enable v-sync, which is kind of lame (but I strongly recommend that you do).			"

												I just HAD to have this game. A long time ago, a friend of mine owned THPS on his PS1. It was fun to play every now and then when I visited, but he became amazing at the game. Watching him get all the achievements was frustrating and fun. I was happy with my Nintendo collection, for sure, but I always wanted to own THPS on a console that would make it more responsive and, especially, look better; So when I saw THPSHD, I knew right away that the game was gonna be a real hair pulling, multi-screaming event in my life.. and it hasn't disappointed at all. The down-side is the DLC of James Hetfield. I for one do NOT like Jim at all and it's an interesting element to know I have to complete the game with him one of these days. If I'm smart, I'll stop all my other work and just go do The Het straight away to get him finished. The soundtrack is a bit lacking (as are the options for music..), but that's just me being a fool. The game is all about ""challenge"" and THPSHD certainly delivers on THAT front. I've been having an awesome time playing the game. I think just about anyone who is into unlocking stuff and perfecting game challenges will like this game. In its own cohesive way it's a sport/puzzle game. It has (for me) just the right type of frustration; it is a real ""damn.. so close"" and ""WHAT!? NO WAY!? I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THAT! RIPPED OFF!"" kinda game. It instills that wonderful fun of having to stay focussed and confident - you'll end up staying on a really difficult section of the game just to GET IT DONE. Eventually, the game opens some really fun cheat modes (which is always cool) and your mind can get confused as to exactly WHY a player should buy all those skateboards - but, so help me, I need everything in the game.. just to see if I can do it. I think it's a fantastic rendition of the older types; loads of fun and frustration. I'd give it a 4 out of 5, but due to Hetfield, I'll give it a 3.			"

												If you just want to relive your memories with THPS, buy it. Otherwise, DO NOT. The current PC version is worse than the console's. No multiplayer (even splitscreen), no advanced options in-game (keymapping, graphic setting) so that you have to tweak them by modifying the data. But considering the game's price, I think I'm either satisfied and dissapointed as well. I hope they will add those features to match the console version.			"

												This game brings back the fun and addictive gameplay that kind of disappeared after Underground 2. It mixes together the two first Pro Skater games (and adds a little bit of 3 in its DLC, which rocks) and brings them to HD.It has all the old objectives from the old games' respective levels, as well as other modes, such as the Projectives mode, which gives the veterans some extra-challenging objectives. If you liked the original Pro Skater games, you'll most likely love this game too.Some of the few criticisms I did have with the game was that in order to adjust graphical settings, you must go and fiddle with the INI files in the game folder (which is almost a must, since V-sync is off by default and the screen tearing is painful).There are also some strange glitches that tend to occasionally screw up a large combo you're building up by making you trip on seemingly nothing or just ending the combo abruptly (though this happens rarely enough for it to not matter much).All in all, old fans and newcomers alike should get a kick out of this game.

												Being a fan of the THPS series for Playstation as a kid growing up a good 14 years ago, I can't even express how excited I was to see this being released. It's bringing back so many memories. Once I finish this here, I'll probably dog out my old PS1 disk and give it a go again. It's been about 3 years now since I last played THPS2.- GREAT improvement in maps graphics and details. Changes from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 have been made, so I noticed in the Hanger level (so far I'm only at lv2), that the hidden room with the helicopter isn't there (at least, not that I've found yet. Still trying to get used to playing this on laptop and not with a controller... wallrides are tricky for me on here).- Different skaters to play as, new and old. Including Hawk's son, Riley.- Classic game modes. Collect S-K-A-T-E etc.- Selected music from THPS2 with some new additions. The soundtrack is just overall fantastic.Recommended to any fan of the series.			"

												I bought this for a nostalgia trip, mostly. It's cheap and I played 2 on PC yonks ago so I thought why not. To be fair, it's very true to the original, and while this is partly a compliment, I'm sure nobody who plays skating games will tell you they're easy. Maybe I was just better at it back then because it's one of the few games I owned, but it's just way too difficult! I can't even begin to comprehend how to get some of the objectives the game has, I fall on my♥♥♥♥♥over and over and there's just not enough time on the level to get any good amount of points. I'm sure I could get better if I tried hard enough, but why would I, really? The controls are just too flawed for a PC interface, and everything happens so fast that I'm just not up to the task that I was ten years ago.			"

Non-rebindable controls, no graphic settings (which you think would be common sense for a game with ""HD"" in it's name, and it doesn't even support full HD), a pathetic choice of levels and skaters, as well as the Unreal 3 Engine, which is great, but not for this game.

												I sincerely regret buying this. All I can say is, it's just not that great. The graphics are neat for what they are, but the gameplay just doesn't seem like the developers tried to make it fun. I'd like to see something like this with Tony Hawk's American Wasteland's engine. I played it enough to unlock the levels, which felt like a chore, and then it lost its appeal from there. This game could've been done right, but wasn't. This isn't exactly a BAD game, it's just really underwhelming, feature-less, and seemingly underdeveloped.			"

												6/10This game is alright, it feels like a mashup of THPS 1-3 with some new skaters. The game itself is visually appealing, but I am dissapointed that the only option in the graphics menu is the ability to alter the resolution, this is a little shabby for a modern PC port. The selection of levels is OK, although personally I feel they could have added a few more to the mix, such as downtown minneapolis from THPS1, Skate street from THPS2. My only problem with the levels is that some of them haven't been adapted to the new game engine, meaning that certain gaps and goals are now more difficult to achieve than in the original games, one of the main examples of this is the venice beach level in which certain gaps and goals have had their difficulty unneccessarily increased, this down to the fact that your skater moves slower than in the classic games. The new engine is nice and it feels like they tried to emulate the THPS3 engine but with more realistic movement, however the game will sometimes throw you off your board even if you don't bail, this can be annoying when trying to get a high score. I'm not too bothered about the lack of multiplayer but local multiplayer/splitscreen would have been an asset here. I'm also dissapointed that you can't dismount your board in order to look around a level in order to find certain goals like in the THUG games. In conclusion it has potential but it feels rushed, it feels like they spent more time porting the levels and making all the movements seem hyper realistic that they forgot to see whether or not their game actually worked properly.tl;dr, buy this if its on sale like I did, otherwise stick to the older games as THUG, THUG-2 and THAW all feature updated versions of the classic levels			"

												As an afficionado of the series since the original THPS on PSX, I find this remake not only lacking in creativity, but also a step back from the by-gone era of ""wheelie""-ing your way to massive combos in Marseille. It combines elements of the first 3 games and levels of the first 2 (IIRC), but playing it does not at all feel the same way. It's like a yellow milkshake that kinda tastes like the banana milkshake you've always loved, but leaves a disgusting aftertaste. Avoid if you're a fan.			"

												Fun bit of reminiscing for those old enough to remember this on PS1 & PC back in the last century. Do not purchase this unless you have a game controller. The XBOX 360 controller works well. It is pretty much unplayable on keyboard unless you are a masochist, really, don't even try.So, I realise that with remakes there are fanatical cannon dorks who want you to stay true to the original, but really, this is not one of those situations. Leaving out the tranny revert was a mistake; landing on the ramp transition and doing a revert into a manual is a feature from later games that this really should have. Only the 3 levels in the DLC pack apparently have that. The other major linking trick missing is the wall plant. Wall rides are there, great, but the wall plant lets you fly head on at a wall, pause momentarily and then effectively bounce off and head back the way you came. These two tricks allow for very long high scoring runs, and should have been coded in. I mean, it's not like Devs had to create the game from scratch right ;) (Yes I am downplaying the work involved in updating a game's textures and resolution to HD, but think about the level design and and the other stuff they didn't need to do).  There is also no way out of a bad ramp exit. If you fly off the side of the ramp, your body is effectively horizontal to the ground and you are going to stack. I am sure I recall later games letting you lean and correct so you can land flat. That's a minor gripe, because it only happens when you've stuffed up, but it's frustrating because as soon as you do it you know it's going to be bad. Finally, it is a little glitchtastic sometimes. You are prone to ragdolling into the fourth dimension, which can happen when you are just trying to grind something or wall ride and don't hit it quite right. It's like you hit a pebble or something and then fly 5 stories into the air. Something is not quite right with the physics of that. Apart from that the game is pretty stable. It's not like it crashes but its a glitch. Still a fun game 20 years later			"

												I really never was into sports games as a kid, but I always did love the THPS games, the first three specifically. So the HD version on steam was a nice little throwback for me, which includes some of the levels, skaters, and punk rock music I've come to know and love. Despite the controls/physics being rather frustrating and clunky at times, I certainly reccommend HD to anyone who loved the classic THPS games as well...just be sure to get it on sale, definately. 3.0/5.0			"

To be honest I expected the old Tony Hawks Pro Skater as it was with just better graphics - but this is definitly not the case here!Did you already played the Original?

I was disappointed at the fact that there was no create-a-charactor. Also, the controls, in my opinion, are not as fluent as they were, say with Tony Hawk 3 on the Gamecube. If I were you, I would pass on this one. If you have access to a PS2 or Gamecube, get a copy and relive the experience the correct way. This game is a cheap cash-in.			"

They can be pretty fun just to mess around with, and I can see myself on a boring rainy day, playing this listening to the music letting the day waste away.If you love tony hawk games, I recommend purchasing this while it is on sale or something.If you never really liked the old games, there is nothing in this that will draw you to it.

I have also experienced bugs with the SPECIAL bar, where it would decide to appear off-screen. This is not an issue with my resolution (1920x1080) as it has appeared normal most of the time.The graphics menu is appauling, with the only setting that you can change being the resolution (there is no other menu that allows you to tweak the graphical settings).The gameplay itself is pretty standard, following after the original game like it should.Overall, looking past the bugs and issues, I still recommend Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.

There are only a pawltry few (6, if I remember offhand) and I blazed through them very quickly. They were mostly the same, except that what were originally competition levels are now just standard goal ones, which is partly why I was so surprised to find I had completed the last level; There is no climax to this game, no giant halfpipe/running with the bulls competition.There are fair number of bugs as well, and even with a controller the controls seemed off.Knowing that now, I wouldn't recommend getting this game unless you can snag it for super cheap.

												So I bought on a whim because it was on sale.  I spent countless hours playing the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater games on the PSX and Dreamcast.  This game feels every bit as good as all of those, the only problem... it is missing the key functionality that made it really enjoyable for me.  You cannot create your own skater.  This is a fatal flaw, because I liked being able to create my own skater and assign the attibutes however I saw fit.  From the standpoint of good old Pro Skater fun, this game has it... with my 360 controller and in 1080p it felt great revisiting the levels I knew so well.But the game just doesn't feel right without the ""RP"" aspect of being able to create your own characters.

												As an HD remake, this mashup of THPS1&2 makes everything much smoother and prettier while still keeping gameplay the same. In addition to Career and Free Skate mode, it adds Projectives, Bighead Endurance, and Hawkman modes to lengthen the lives of the admittedly short level list. More levels, characters, and moves are coming in the THPS3 DLC.Sadly, there are no create-a-modes. There are also very few PC customization options in-game, requiring you to look up how to change settings online through the game's text files.It's a great start, though it'll need a few DLC to match the amount of content we've come to expect from Tony Hawk games. Now, if only we could get this hooked up to the Steam Workshop and creative tools, we'd have an untapped goldmine on our hands. That, and expanding the short soundtrack / adding the option for user tracks.I'm having great fun kicking my old scores to the curb btw.			"

If anything this game is just ruining great memories. If, like me, you no longer have a console to get you through the THPS cravings then just go get some roms of the series instead; their free, their better, and if your pc can run this then it can run a ps emulator.

												I used to play thps many years ago with my friends on split screen and spent many countless hours trying to get that epic score or secret tape etc. This is pretty much an update of the first 2 games and you can get a cheap dlc for the 3rd game which includes an essential trick called revert. This helps you get better combos and carry on your trick for a better score and ultimately more fun. The game is great for skateboard fans but also for anyone really. I wasnt a skateboard fan but i loved the game and found it easy to get into and had lots of fun. Not much has changed from the originals really apart from a graphics overhall. This is good though for nostalgia sake and is still a great game to play. The levels included in this are the best levels from the first three games. My personal favourites are School, Canada and Marseille but i enjoy all of them really. Go get grinding :)			"

												7.5/10. It was a pretty good game I think.. It was basically all Tony Hawk games combined with one but with no story. This game really brings you back to the younger days for sure :) THUG series and Wasteland still blow this game out of the water, but look at it this way, you have the gameplay maps back with more characters and different styles of tricks. I recommend this game for Tony Hawk video game fans. Like I said!!!!!! This game beats the first two original Tony Hawk Pro skater games, not sure about the third one yet.. That's because I havent played the DLC. PLAY THIS GAME WITH A CONTROLLER!!!!!!!!!!			"

												I went into this game blind. The only Tony Hawk game I ever played was THPS4 (and Ride, but that was dreadful.) I bought the game and the Revert pack at the same time. My pros and cons:Pros:Fluid and fast gameplayGreat character and level design (but it's a remake of THPS1 and 2, so that's a gibbon.)The cheats are delicious fun, including one that lets you play as classic Tony Hawk.The controls feel VERY natural, especially with a controllerCustomizable boards and unlockable characters make getting money funCons:Very glitchy. My board sometimes went sailing off into space and I go the opposite direction.The game likes to cheat with the big drops, telling you right before you fall on your face.The game is basically inaccessible to the newcomers without cheats.Goals become extremely hard in career mode. It asked me to get 3 roll call rails, but I couldn't tell what they were until I grinded on them.With all of that said, it's a very fun game. Many people might disagree, but I had a lot of fun, and I think you will too.Overall Score: 8/10			"

												This game does NOT AT ALL feel like playing the classic THPS, even though the control scheme is similar (but forget about rebinding gamepad or keyboard buttons). The movement feels sluggish, there aren't a lot of tricks available and you can't customize your skater much. If you remember the good times in classic THPS, this game isn't for you.

												If you want to get this game to get your skateboarding fix, there are better ones out there.If you're considering this because you have nostalgia for the old days of THPS, prepare to have your hopes sliced, diced and crushed. The game has been rebuilt in a new engine, and it just doesn't feel the same. Something I can't quite put my finger on; something is off. Maybe the gravity is too floaty, or the griding is too easy, but something just feels wrong. It'd be better to go back to the originals and relive the glory days there.			"

												Fun bit of reminiscing for those old enough to remember this on PS1 & PC back in the last century. Do not purchase this unless you have a game controller. The XBOX 360 controller works well. It is pretty much unplayable on keyboard unless you are a masochist, really, don't even try.So, I realise that with remakes there are fanatical cannon dorks who want you to stay true to the original, but really, this is not one of those situations. Leaving out the tranny revert was a mistake; landing on the ramp transition and doing a revert into a manual is a feature from later games that this really should have. Only the 3 levels in the DLC pack apparently have that. The other major linking trick missing is the wall plant. Wall rides are there, great, but the wall plant lets you fly head on at a wall, pause momentarily and then effectively bounce off and head back the way you came. These two tricks allow for very long high scoring runs, and should have been coded in. I mean, it's not like Devs had to create the game from scratch right ;) (Yes I am downplaying the work involved in updating a game's textures and resolution to HD, but think about the level design and and the other stuff they didn't need to do).  There is also no way out of a bad ramp exit. If you fly off the side of the ramp, your body is effectively horizontal to the ground and you are going to stack. I am sure I recall later games letting you lean and correct so you can land flat. That's a minor gripe, because it only happens when you've stuffed up, but it's frustrating because as soon as you do it you know it's going to be bad. Finally, it is a little glitchtastic sometimes. You are prone to ragdolling into the fourth dimension, which can happen when you are just trying to grind something or wall ride and don't hit it quite right. It's like you hit a pebble or something and then fly 5 stories into the air. Something is not quite right with the physics of that. Apart from that the game is pretty stable. It's not like it crashes but its a glitch. Still a fun game 20 years later			"

												This game, more or less, simply retreads the original levels of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 (with 3 as DLC) with a new soundtrack (that sucks in comparison to the original soundtracks) and new skaters (that I couldn't care less about).The game also has this really cool, really loud glass breaking sound effect. The sound effect is so loud that if you muted your TV you'd still go deaf from the glass (and ear) shattering sound.Recommend for the nostalgia and the feels. Don't recommend because my ears are bleeding.			"

												I've been a big fan of the tony hawks games for a long time. Thps1 and Thps2 on the PS1 gave me a lot of single player fun. The games after that gave me many hours of multiplayer fun. While i can appreciate this game for what its trying to be i just can't get into it like many of the later games. - Did i enjoy thps1 and 2? yes - Do i feel nostalgic about those games and gameplay? yes- Do i want to relive that level of gameplay and control NO. The thing about this game is that really doesn't settle with me is the controls, it really does feel like those early thps games which is obviously what they were aiming for but i feel like they really missed their peak with this remake. This should have been a game celebrating much more than just the original but celebrating the evolution of the series. Pros- Some different gameplay modes, projectives, hawkman, big head mode etc are all nice additions- Enough hours of gameplay to be something- looks great, how i would imagine the levels would look in modern day graphics- Soundtrack is nice has some of the original tracks and a few others- A great selection of levels from across the seriesCons- I miss graffiti, peds with goals, the usual game modes- no multiplayer- revert is a dlc? what the hell are you trying to be old thps style or not make up your mind- no create a skater/park/trick etc- its just lacking that neversoft touchOk so i will recommend this game but here are my recommendations..- If you like the original thps games you will like this.- If you haven't really played much thps games you will most likely get used to the gameplay and mostly enjoy this.- If you are someone who spent hours and hours of time playing thps3/thps4/thug/thug2 online or offline you will probably feel like me a little dissapointed but may enjoy it if you put in more than a few hours and get used to its quirks.

												I loved it, this was THPS But at it's best I didn't find any bugs or glitches, the only time I fell down or got stuck was when I messed up a landing, this game is by far the most realistic skateboarding game to date!!! I remember the ps1 controls for this game and they are right on the money for the xbox 360 controller for the pc, X=Square, Y = Triangle, B= circle, A=X, right trigger= switch/ spin, left trigger=fakey/spin...I have no idea what people are talking about ""they messed up the controls"". I used to skate years ago and the physics on this game felt real and if you mess up you are punished accordingly, after about 20-30 minutes of getting used to the physics that just beat the pants out of all other skateboarding games I was back to hitting all the high scores and busting out insane combo's whilst having an even better time than I had in any of it's predecessors. Best purchase I have made in years, when I said  very realistic I meant that in gfx and physics aswell as how it actually feels when you take off of a ramp and line up the landing the charecters movement are almost completely flawless and in alot of cases I found the movements perfected and they left in the rediculous obsurd jumps, rail and ledges that keep it fun which is why it is still a game and not a sim although they aren't far off.

Tony Hawk Pro Skater game change this totally for me.All from the starts when I start the game an hear the music from the old games...... love it (L)They did a really great job converting the game in to a HD remake.For me it's more like a complication from 1 to 3 and I hope they will bring out more games.It's basic as hell.... just skate every level and mark all things of the list.Like getting the high score, find the secret tape, collect the letters skate and much more.Controls are easy to learn and the game plays very good.If you can find this game for a few dollar / euro ... try it out.I personally give it a 8 / 10.

If you are new to it, it will eventually get repetitive, but that is just how the game is.Apart from a few know bugs that you have to work around when doing tricks, like jumping and trying to do a trick to land and grind, the skater will almost always fly off and fall.Also, you cannot remap the controls, but there are tools available that let you do it. Search google a bit and you'll find them.Anyways, awesome skater game.			"

												Why did I even buy this? Oh wait, I know. Because I'm a TH games fan and I wanted to know if the whole series will go down an even bigger sh#tter ever since Neversoft sold it many years ago. And why wouldn't it go down that way when we had TH's Ride, Shred, Motion, several ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile games and now this garbage?Playing this on a keyboard is hell as it's not the usual 2, 4, 6, 8 controlling and you can't even rebind it. I got through half of game and had enough. Remade maps from the old games look nice but it doesn't make up for the mess.			"

												Honestly don't buy this game. I played all the Tony Hawk games growing up and thought this would of been a nice remider of past days. I was horribly mistaken. The look may be there but the feel of the game isn't there. The controls are bad as hell.The physics of the game are terrible. Many times where you should of fallen you stay on your board and times where you clearly landed perfect it says you were off and makes you crash. Please do not support this game, after not even the first 5 mins I regretted even buying this.			"

												7.5/10. It was a pretty good game I think.. It was basically all Tony Hawk games combined with one but with no story. This game really brings you back to the younger days for sure :) THUG series and Wasteland still blow this game out of the water, but look at it this way, you have the gameplay maps back with more characters and different styles of tricks. I recommend this game for Tony Hawk video game fans. Like I said!!!!!! This game beats the first two original Tony Hawk Pro skater games, not sure about the third one yet.. That's because I havent played the DLC. PLAY THIS GAME WITH A CONTROLLER!!!!!!!!!!			"

												EDIT: I gave this game a second chance and couldnt put it down. It is worth the $7.49 I paid. Your skater will bail often and it is annoying but it makes the game more challenging. The white screen you get when you bail is still annoying. Good music, some classics are in there. It's nice how the music continues to play from the level to the menu. you can buy ""special tricks"" like 360 flips and what not.What an awful game to be made in 2012. It's not even worth the $7.49 I paid. I've been playing Tony Hawk games since they came out and this is actually worst of them all. If your character is even a slight bit off when you land, you will bail. instead of the character getting up, it goes to an awful white screen and it restarts you. Sparks fly when you board slide (wtf). No online capability for PC users. WHERE THE F*** IS Chad Muska? And you can't do more than 8 flips, grabs, or grinds. I know this is a THPS 1 remake but com'n you couldn't add 360 flips and 360 shuvits? Also the default grind is a backside nose grind. should it be a 50-50? That last problem could be because of my controller but I'm not going to play this game again to find out because it sucks so bad.			"

												Belo remake do Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 do Playstation®. Chegou para os jogadores de PC depois de um bom tempo após sair para consoles. Jogabilidade muito boa, porém a versão PC peca em não ter multiplayer online nem coop local. Mas pelo preço que o jogo é vendido, vale a pena relembrar os velhos jogos de Skate. Bem que a Steam poderia trazer os outros jogos da série para a plataforma deles.			"

												This is a good game if you need a fix of Tony Hawk games and you've already played the hell out of all the old ones. This is a decent installment in the franchise and deserves at least a buy. There isn't too much content. No create a skater or create a park, there's a lot of stuff missing. It chooses good maps from the First couple Pro Skater games, sadly only 7 maps though. The soundtrack isn't phenominal as it usually is, but it's still pretty great. There's not a whole lot of content, but that's why the game is 10 dollars and not 40. It's definitely worth a try, but it won't be what you've been waiting for from the Tony Hawk franchise all these years.			"

												Да, конечно когда-то я играл и был рад серии Тони Хоука, но потом почему-то новые части стали всё слабее и слабее предыдущих! Поэтому я перестал играть в него, да и вообще уже наскучила езда на скейте, не говоря уже о графике!Но вот недавно я наткнулся на Тони HD - я тут же её запустил и начал играть, радость моя продолжалась недолго! Потому что управление стало каким-то неудобным, геймплей не радует, графика в HD размытая, даже музыка, характерная для этой игры не понравилась! Чего-то нового или каких то дополнений в игре просто нету - в общем это всё тот же Хоук, только в новой обёртке!Игра скучная, так что надолго она вас не затянет, потому что ей просто не чем это сделать!

When the old games for PS1 that this game is supposed to be homage to are better, then you know there's something wrong with your game. The only reason I could think of for buying this is for the nostalgia feel, and for that you'd be better off getting a PS1 emulator and playing the older games anyway. This is not worth money, if you really want to play it, download it elsewhere.			"

												It's awesome to see such a classic game brought to Steam. Brings me back to the days of my Ps2 :') The soundtrack is amazing and to be completely honest, the game would be nothing without it. However, I do have one complaint. This game was built to be played with a controller which is why the controls are absolute trash on keyboard. The keyboard controls feel awkward and almost unplayable with and it's without the choice to set your own controls in-game, I'd only recommend this game to people who have a controller ready.			"

The extra gamemodes bring back some of the difficulty (if going for the sick scores), and the large amount of skaters brings a lot of fun.Also, there are certain unlockables that make it more fun, especially the 4 secret characters that you can unlock.If you want an N64 game, go away.

												After hearing many negative things about this game, I was finally able to try it for myself, and I must say it is a mediocre game at best. It is very shallow, even compared to the source matieral. I want to go into detail and list why I do not recommend this game as a Tony Hawk veteran, and not based on blind hatred.First, A few pros:1) Game looks great. It gives what it sells itself on.2) Other gamemodes are intresting enough to replay levels. They may be bland or uninspired, but it's something to do, about all you'd expect from side modes.3) Stable(ish) PC port4) Much of the old soundtrack was brought back, with some new school tunes thrown in as well.5) Very cheap, especially on sale.Now, why I gave this game a negative review.My Personal Gripes:1) Even though it includes levels from both THPS1 and THPS2, the fact that only a few from each were included was a huge letdown. The lack of New York, Philly, and even School 1, very good maps, were axed in favour of levels like Hangar, and yet ANOTHER DHJ. 2) Goal variety and creativity was very limited. In absensce of Interesting goals or ideas, almost every extra goal made for THPS1 levels were ""Collect 5 ___"". We already have Skate letters and the original goals, making them seem extremley redundant and halting any kind of flow you could get in the first place when collecting goals.   And let's talk about the ""Projectives"". On the first level, it shows some promise as a fun gamemode, more challenge and more goals for levels is something I can get down with, If not every level HAD THE EXACT SAME GOALS. Like seriously?! Combo and score I can understand, but who the ♥♥♥♥ wanted to boneless over a bum in EVERY level?3)  While I understand it is a remake and is supposed to follow the source matieral, they copied almost everything bad about previous games as well. Special manuals being on grabs, the old school special system, and Big Drops are all things we could have lived without.4) Zero Create a Modes. No Parks, No Skaters, nothing.5) On the topic of skaters, this game's cast is lackluster. This is more of a personal complaint than an objective view, but  so many skaters from the original are missing. If they got Steve and Rodney's old asses back, Why not Jamie, Bob, or anyone else? 6)  The complete lack of competitions is a little offputing. I could have lived without them, but giving goals to competition maps that weren't based around regular goals feels extremley awkward. But then again, with this game's 7 non DLC maps, doubt they could fit it anyways. And that was just my personal list, here's why I think the game is Mechanically badPure Mechanical Failures:1) Manuals are far too sensitive. 50% of the time after a bail, you start in a manual because of how sensitive the controls are. They worked fine in previous games, what happened here?2) Game is WAYYY too floaty. It's constantly enabled moon gravity, hell, With max air and hang time you go FARTHER than you would with moon gravity. It makes the game feel super awkward and inconsistant. 3) Combos drop super easy in this game. Whether it be manuals, reverts, or even grinds sometimes, you are at the games mercy of whether or not you keep your combo going. Extremley frustrating.4) Hitboxes are insanley inconcistent. It's either a mile wide or a pixel small. This has always been a problem in the franchise, but it's a glaring issue here with the altered physics. I should not have to do a trick over a gap 5 times before it counts.5)  The engine in general. It handles almost nothing like older tony games, which is ok, change was expected, but this engine gives you little to no control of your movement. It feels loose and sloppy, If you are a veteran Tony Hawk fan, only pick up this game on sale if you're curious enough. It is not worth the money or your time. I gave this game a legitimate chance and tried to turn the other cheek, but I couldn't. Avoid this game if you're looking for a genuine tony experience.			"

												I rarely write reviews for games, THPSHD is not as bad as the negative reviews pose it to be. If you're a true fan you'll accept that this is an old school game remastered to life. Yes it has it's faults but i've been playing 23 hours on record and still come back for more. It's obviously not a 24/7 kind of game, but just a sit back and relax type of (arcade) as i would call it. I don't own any consoles anymore as i've travelled abroad. I've been craving a tony hawk game for a while and decided regardless of the negative reviews i'll still get it. I don't regret 1 penny. The nostalgic feel with the remastered graphics blows the game out of the water. Don't forget this game came out a loooong time ago obviously you can't compare it to anything new.In conclusion. don't refrain from the negative reviews. This is not a paid advertisment, i'm just a skater gamer that always loved the Tony Hawk games, and would recommend this game to any true skater fan.			"

												Buy this game, especially if it's on sale. Buy it to support the concept of Tony Hawk's games on PC, buy it for a couple hours of quick fun, buy it for some nostalgic bliss. DO NOT buy it if you're hoping for a next gen installment of THPS. The graphics are quite good, actually, but the controls are impossible to master, and theres a lot of stuff that it is missing. Namly, wall/sticker slaps. It's very difficult to keep a beast combo going without wall slaps. Moreover, there doesn't appear to be spine transfers, but in their place there is an unreliable action notice when you transfer. You can't get off your board, but that's more of a luxury anyways. When I was very little, I played THPS 3, but I really grew up playing the Underground games, but still, I'm certain this game is using an old engine, from one of the first couple games.			"

												Classic THPS gameplay which is awesome, but who was in charge of controller support? this game was one of the hardest titles ive ever had to setup controls for. if it werent for the fact that this is the only TH game on steam it would be gettnig a bad review. basically if youre ok with keyboard controls (or have a 360 controller? i dont so im not sure about that) its worth a few bucks, but dont expect much other than some classic levels and goals.

												Sad but cant reccomend it. Controls animations and physicts are just to bad. Animations are choppy and controls wonky and unreliable. Much of the speed of the tony hawk games are lost and the slow pace of the first games (TH 1 , TH2) dont go well with the new engine and choice of animations and controls in this HD release. Palyed every tonyhawkgame from the first to somthing of the lines of tonyhawk wasteland from start to finish. Replayed most of the earlyer ones on psp or other devises over the years and this one on PC just feels wrong.			"

												it's the kind of game you'd play on your own. First Tony Hawk game i ever picked up was THPS3, so i don't know how the original was. It plays well, though. DLC's kinda nice. Sometimes it'll bug out, and you'll fall as you're taking off a half-pipe or something.Gamepad is recommended out of personal preference because keyboard seems weird.soundtrack has new songs and old songs from the first two games.can't mess with soundtrack either, so i just set it to 0 and listen to stuff on youtube with steam overlay.Some old skaters and some new ones. I just sprung for the DLC anyways since Chad Muska ain't in here.Out of all things, it's a 7/10. good, casual way to pass time.			"

												I feel like something is missing from this game i'm not sure what it is but i know something isn't quite right however. It's still a some what enjoyable game it's very short. I've nearly completed career mode and there are most certainly maps missing from 1 and 2 that they have here. This game also came out in 2012 and it promises that they'll add maps from 3 which i have yet to see at all. Also none of the skaters you played in 1 or 2 are in this except tony and maybe 2 others. it's a new group of skaters. ovbiously because of character rights so you're not going to see Jamie Thomas or Bob Burnquist in this. it has some hidden characters as well. The Cop, Ollie the bum and a Robot. but none of these characters are as exciting as the ones they had like spiderman and such. of course again because of rights.On the whole (or hole lol) Tony Hawk's Pro skater HD isn't the best adeptation of 1 and 2. If you really want the best tony hawk skateboarding experiance I highly recommend you get Tony Hawk's Underground 2 or Pro skater 4. If you're looking for an okay skate boarding experiance than this game will do ya but don't pay full price. I paid about 4 dollars for this on humble bundle.			"

												This game is really bad. I really loved this series but this is just really bad. I came back to it after awhile to see if there would be any updates and it's disappointing to see that it is the same poor quality game. Here are my issues with the game:- Graphics aren't a ton better than older releases- Game can't recognize when you want to do a wall ride over a grind or kickflip- Controls are really clunky- No cool manual moves you can switch to like THPS3 or THUG- Reverts are in a lackluster DLC (although it does add other skaters and locations)- No Free Skate (The best part)- No Multiplayer (No way to go online or do a SKATE switch off)- No custom skatepark or skater feature (Custom skateboard feature was awesome too)- Lacking in levels and other skatersThe good things I can say is the soundtrack is ok and I like that they attempted to bring back the classics. I was always hoping though that it would be all the levels with all the best parts of all the games from the series. Instead, we got this. This game is very disappointing.			"

The one problem is the floor glitches a lot and isn't reliable.But worth the money if you like video games and skate boarding. I wouldn't expect to much of the game but it's still worth 100% of the money you pay would buy it againbut make sure to use the key board and not a controller if you use a controller you'll have a worse time playing. But as awlays in tony hawk games the music is AMAZING.Summing up the gameatemps flipfails so hardtry agean fails less hardtry cooler flips rage quits best skate board game. But like i said before the game could use some work on the glitches with the floor and the wallsbut its still worth the money.			"

To be honest I expected the old Tony Hawks Pro Skater as it was with just better graphics - but this is definitly not the case here!Did you already played the Original? So don't spoil your memories with this game here. It is just another Tony Hawk but not the first one!			"

												In half an hour of gameplay, I managed to get stuck in the level on five different occasions. Most of the missions have been changed in some way, and often for the worse. There are significantly more ""Go collect X of Y"" missions than in the console versions of the same games. Finally, there's the cash system introduced in this game. It's passable, as a system, but if you played the console games and remember trying to collect all the stat points in each level, you're going to be disappointed.			"

It's a very good remake of THPS1 and 2, however, the lack of a multiplayer function -either split screen or online- makes it be a little less valuable than it would be.

More importantly, the feel of the game is somewhat worse than the classic versions. Jumping feels like you're floating and you sometimes ball out of random when trying to do a wallride or grind. The big fall seems to be a bigger problem than it was before, but that might be just me. Also, the PC version is just bad. There are no graphic settings or controll settings. So in conclusion, this game is fun, but different. Just bring a controller and a decent computer.			"

												I loved it, this was THPS But at it's best I didn't find any bugs or glitches, the only time I fell down or got stuck was when I messed up a landing, this game is by far the most realistic skateboarding game to date!!! I remember the ps1 controls for this game and they are right on the money for the xbox 360 controller for the pc, X=Square, Y = Triangle, B= circle, A=X, right trigger= switch/ spin, left trigger=fakey/spin...I have no idea what people are talking about ""they messed up the controls"". I used to skate years ago and the physics on this game felt real and if you mess up you are punished accordingly, after about 20-30 minutes of getting used to the physics that just beat the pants out of all other skateboarding games I was back to hitting all the high scores and busting out insane combo's whilst having an even better time than I had in any of it's predecessors. Best purchase I have made in years, when I said  very realistic I meant that in gfx and physics aswell as how it actually feels when you take off of a ramp and line up the landing the charecters movement are almost completely flawless and in alot of cases I found the movements perfected and they left in the rediculous obsurd jumps, rail and ledges that keep it fun which is why it is still a game and not a sim although they aren't far off.

												Honestly don't buy this game. I played all the Tony Hawk games growing up and thought this would of been a nice remider of past days. I was horribly mistaken. The look may be there but the feel of the game isn't there. The controls are bad as hell.The physics of the game are terrible. Many times where you should of fallen you stay on your board and times where you clearly landed perfect it says you were off and makes you crash. Please do not support this game, after not even the first 5 mins I regretted even buying this.			"

												6/10This game is alright, it feels like a mashup of THPS 1-3 with some new skaters. The game itself is visually appealing, but I am dissapointed that the only option in the graphics menu is the ability to alter the resolution, this is a little shabby for a modern PC port. The selection of levels is OK, although personally I feel they could have added a few more to the mix, such as downtown minneapolis from THPS1, Skate street from THPS2. My only problem with the levels is that some of them haven't been adapted to the new game engine, meaning that certain gaps and goals are now more difficult to achieve than in the original games, one of the main examples of this is the venice beach level in which certain gaps and goals have had their difficulty unneccessarily increased, this down to the fact that your skater moves slower than in the classic games. The new engine is nice and it feels like they tried to emulate the THPS3 engine but with more realistic movement, however the game will sometimes throw you off your board even if you don't bail, this can be annoying when trying to get a high score. I'm not too bothered about the lack of multiplayer but local multiplayer/splitscreen would have been an asset here. I'm also dissapointed that you can't dismount your board in order to look around a level in order to find certain goals like in the THUG games. In conclusion it has potential but it feels rushed, it feels like they spent more time porting the levels and making all the movements seem hyper realistic that they forgot to see whether or not their game actually worked properly.tl;dr, buy this if its on sale like I did, otherwise stick to the older games as THUG, THUG-2 and THAW all feature updated versions of the classic levels			"

												(16.6 hours of time spent before I reviewed it)This game gets a lot of negative reviews, but since I haven’t played any of the old THPS or any TH games, I still enjoy it.When you start the game, you can select from several different skaters who weren’t in the older games like Tony Hawk’s son Riley Hawk. Each character has their own special ability, for instance Rodney Mullen is great at doing manuals in the game while other characters may not be as good. The levels to the game are taken from THPS and it’s sequel THPS2, ranging from a hangar to a mall. The music can get quiet annoying and repetitive throughout the levels.When you are playing through the objective mode, the levels can seem monotonous since all your doing is tricks and collecting things. On some stages its really fun to do the objectives but on others, not so much. If you get tired of doing the same old objectives, you can take a break in Free Skate mode. I actually find that mode to be somewhat relaxing. There are a few other modes like one where you have to follow a certain path doing a certain kind of trick.There is one DLC pack that adds some more mechanics, stages, and characters from THPS3.Overall, I like the game. It does have its issues like the repetitiveness, but it has plenty of redeeming qualities like fun gameplay.I rate this game a 8/10~bottlehead			"

												I understand why some eople who played the orignal back on ps1 are a bit dissapointed with this, for reasons im sure you will find in other comments but as someone who only played the odd few tony hawks on ps2 and skate on ps3, I can safely say I ruddy enjoy this game (its nothing special but still, bloody love it). plus the 90s/2000s soundtrack is a beaut. pick it up on sale for 2 or 3 dollars/pounds becas ♥♥♥♥ it ;D			"

												I am a long time fan of the Tony Hawk GamesI have played starting from 2 on PSOne all the way through Project 8 (Not counting the Ride Games and 5).I find this on sale on Humble and I wonder ""How did I miss this one?"" So I bought it without thinking, played and waited with halted breath as the first level loaded. And I almost instantly hated it.For a start, the tight controls of the original are gone.

The funny part is we already have a decent remake for Tony Hawk 2, it's called Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x on the xbox.

												It's somewhat difficult to recommend this game. It feels similar to the orginal THPS titles, but the controls, and quality aren't quite the same. Thus, letting Us long time THPS players experience something that comes up a little short. If you're new to the series, this can be a fun way to experience it. However, the original titles for the PS1 & PS2, are more polished.			"

												This game is awful. I wanted a good skateboarding game to play. I remembered playing Tony Hawk when I was little. The controls have me wanting to throw my controller. I'll press buttons for certain things to happen, and nothing will happen. My character has run into walls instead of wall riding, refused to pop over quarter pipes. It's too frustrating and now I question if the earlier Tony Hawk games I had were good. Don't ruin your childhood memories. Skip this game.			"

												Pretty much as advertised. The cleaner graphics sorta takes away the gritty charm it had back in the day because it actually looks like you're in a crappy skateparks. My complaint is that even after making sure the game saved MULTIPLE times before quitting, I always have to start from square one when I fire it up again. Still a good way to burn some time with that classic nostalgic teen angst soundtrack.			"

												It is worth it if you are a big Tony Hawk  fan, I enjoy it but would have preferred a remake for THPS3.  That was by far the best.They did add some new elements and moves that are nice, but the engine it runs on feels goofy. Some times when I attempt to grind, my character will just rag doll and float or go flying across the map. It was funny at first but then it started happening so often it was irritating.  The music is not all the same but that is alright. They added a some new characters as well which look great. To me, it would be worth it if it was sub $5.  and I am a big fan of the classic THPS games. I did enjoy the newer ones but at project 8, it was no longer interesting.**Update**  Super glitchy and playing any of the original 3 is a better use of time.			"

												Well at least it's not Ride or Shred.. Gameplay is messed up, doesn't have that quick TH's feeling like THPS3 and THPS4 had. The graphics looks nice and I love the soundtrack, unfortunantly that's pretty much it. No new levels and just a few skaters (I know it's a ""remake"", but still). They ♥♥♥♥ed up the balance meter so good luck going for insane scores. Robomodo had an amazing opportunity to revive this series but they failed to deliver.Anyways,  I did occasionally enjoy this game and it's definitely not a horrible game. It's just not a good Tony Hawk's game. Go get THUG 2 and download the THUG PRO mod instead, because you're worth it <3			"
