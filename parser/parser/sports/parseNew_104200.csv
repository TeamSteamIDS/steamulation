												This is a really charming game, I only found this game because I won it during the Winter 2014 Auction, and i'm surprised that i've never seen it before because it's fantastic.I like the art style of the game, The game has quite a lot of attention to detail, such as a ""level select"" area where you can pilot a space shuttle and you can mess around with it for a few minutes and crash into space rocks.  I've only played through two levels so far but they've both been quite atmospheric as well and i love the underground areas as they feel like they add even more to the levels. I really like the physics of the game too as the physics add to the experience and add another element to the gameplay rather than how physics are incorporated into most games now, and just ""being there"" rather than actually adding anything to the game.So far it's quite simple and i'm not sure if it will manage to stay captivating for the entire game but right now i'm having a lot of fun with the game.Only had a quick play of this game so far but definitely looking forward to playing more.

												Worth every cent of the $0.21 I paid for it.Best game made with MS Paint ever.Okay, a more serious review.Beep has some good ideas, and with the recent sub-$1 sale it's was a good value, but this game was tossed out to customers before it was done.Game play concepts are good and the game is fun, but it starts too slow and the early levels are somewhat boring. Later levels get better, but it doesn't seem like this title was in development for a long time. It seems a little rushed.Every time something like a bomb explodes, I see black blocks on the screen where I suspect smoke would be, but instead I am getting some kind of graphical glitch.The user interface, especially the main menu and options, were slapped together at the last minute by an unpaid intern.Barriers and puzzles are unfortunately a bit weak. I was hoping for a better challenge.And finally, I think some players give up in the first few minutes to game play when they have trouble figuring out how to deploy for the first time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do, and it was unnecessarily frustrating.Beep is kinda fun, but be sure to get it on sale. It's not a value at full price.			"

												Now THIS is a fun little platformer, adding little quirks to it that makes it just that little bit more unique.Now I'm not a big fan of platformers (except for the good old original mario games and a few rayman games) but I absolutely loved this one. I like how you can fly your ship around and choose where you want to do. Just everything about it feels fresh, like a whole new spin on how platforming games are made.You play as a robot with a variety of abilities, you can jump around, grab items, drag them around and do all sorts of things with them. You can even shoot if you want. But I like defeating enemies with gravity, it's amusing.It's hard to describe the game without showing it, so definitely check out video footage of the game and see if it's for you.If you're a fan of platformers, you won't be disappointed with this game. If you're like me and you're not too much of a fan, give it a go if you can get this on the cheap, I was pleasantly surprised and you may be too.I recommend this game.			"

												Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it! The level design is consistently ""pretty good,"" with occasional memorable moments.You play as a BEEP robot, exploring a system to collect antimatter. Gameplay consists of mostly platforming puzzles utilizing moving, jumping, shooting, and, more often than not, the Zero Point Energy Field manipulator (read: gravity gun) which you control with the right mouse button. The game takes place in an unnamed star system with three planets. Each of the two hemispheres on each planet has its own environments, music, and introduces one or two game mechanics that for the most part are used exclusively for that hemisphere. Each hemisphere has 4 levels, which each have 3 anti-matter nuggets to find, as well as a bonus fourth one which is rewarded upon collecting ~20 smaller pellets scattered around the level. This leaves 96 antimatter parts to collect. In order to unlock the next hemisphere, you must find a minimum amount of antimatter nuggets in the previous levels, as well as getting to the end of all the previous levels.While this game is certainly charming, it's not without its flaws. It is very possible to use the antimatter to grab an item and use it to propel yourself upwards before grabbing it and using it again, and, if you're good enough at it, can be used to get over almost any obstacle. While the game never requires you to do this, it is tempting to do it to get just a little more air to climb a wall. On quite a few walls, it is possible to simply drive straight up them by moving towards them, as one of BEEP's wheels seems to clip into the wall. The difficulty curve is somewhat predictable up until the last planet, where both hemispheres present environmental hazards that make the game much more difficult (though not frustratingly so). Completing levels honestly felt a little unrewarding, and I was consistently able to 100% complete levels my first time visiting, never having to backtrack. Additionally, there is no reward for collecting all 96 nuggets of anti-matter. This may be an issue for people who invest more time to collect everything. I managed to beat the game and collect everything without backtracking in under 4 hours.As a snobby musician, I thought the music was pretty forgettable, However, it had themes that appeared multiple times in the game, which is always interesting to discover, and the music never feels out of place. The art style feels very much like that of a decent flash game, using basic shapes and characters with cartoony eyes and solid colors. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it feels hastily done to me.At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.49. I can definitely recommend it at that price, at least. It's a cute little game, but don't expect hardcore gameplay or mindblowing game design.			"

												Beep is a sweet casual side-scrolling platformer. Would I tried to dismantle it, I'd saw the pieces of many other good games: World of Goo, Mario, StuntMania, with the addition of gravity beam from Half Life 2... whatever. Really I don't want do dig that deep.You've got a rocket, you fly from planet to planet, to disembark a little robot there, which then goes from the left part of the screen to the right side, jumping, climbing, diving, shooting the bad robots, and moving objects with the gravity force... As easy as it sounds, after some time given, the puzzles getting more and more complex and challenging.As of downsides, I really can think only of one. It is cartoon-styled and not-that-much-rewarding. Obviously, I'm a bit too old for this type of gameplay, but I'll easily pass Beep to my kids.My mark is 7.1/10. Not the brightest star on the sky of game design, but the one made clear and thorough. Well-fit for little casual play sessions.			"

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  BEEPDeveloper:  Big Fat AlienPublisher:  Sunken Treasure Games, Big Fat AlienGenre:  Physics-based platformerGeneral ImpressionBEEP is a 2D platformer that features some very interesting physics-based gameplay mechanics via a gravity gun of sorts. The art style and stage diversity have made a good impression upon myself, since I’m already used to so many bland platfoming games out there. BEEP stands out from the crowd with the use of clever mechanics and pleasant 2D graphics. It contains a decent number of puzzles that encourage different approaches. The sounds are also without major complaint and the game’s only flaws remain the bane of many similar platformers: relative short experience and no multiplayer support.Strong Points+ Interesting gameplay and level design.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- Short experience even if there is some replay value.- No Steam Achievements.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												5.1/10 - Platformer: Disney's Wall-E with a Grav Gun!I was fonder of playing this platformer than I thought; maybe it's that I have played so many bad ones... but this one delivered for the most part. The typical platformer template is combined with beautiful graphics and some unique gameplay. You mostly rely on your propulsion rockets and a gravity gun that can help you achieve your objectives. Platformers can be difficult in general; and this one will cause you to struggle, but this game is more on the enjoyable and achievable side of things. There is quite a bit of content and plethora of maps to explore for the meager price of $2; caution though this game can be found on sale more often than not!Worth the $2; I'd only pay $0.50 though since it's always on sale for that!

Even if it seems there won't be hours and hours of gameplay, what I have played so far  is still incredibly fun and since the game is cheap, well worth it.I recommend this game!(There was a slight bug at the start with screen size, but to fix this all you need to do is press ALT + Enter to go windowed)			"

												I played this with my son, so I may have a bias here.  This is a simple platforming action game.  You are a robot in search of gold in different worlds.  Your robot can fly temporarily and you must go through a few different worlds ranging from ice worlds, to desert worlds.  The game doesn't necessarily stand out, however the tight controls and the cartonny graphics and animation make it a good play for young children.  Definitely gets a thumbs up for its accessibility for my son.			"

												BEEP is very well balanced and just plain fun to play. You know these games where you feel the dedication of the developers? BEEP is just that! Instead of playing clones and remakes of old 2D platformers why not play a modern game that brings new things to the table? Well, i wouldn't say BEEP is very innovative with it's features but it feels polished from the beginning and will surprise you here and there. For some reason, it's easy to fall in love with this game.""BEEP"" is a simple but interesting game with some cute graphics and good physics and awesome music. Nice example of how to create an indie game without being pretentious. Nothing less, nothing more.			"

												A fun little platformer. Took me a little over 6 hours to complete the whole game and I'm usually not very good at these games. The later levels were quite challenging.Aside from some graphics glitches (black boxes sometimes randomly appear when you kill an enemy) this game was a lot of fun. Too bad certain game elements were restricted to specific worlds, like flying and grappling. Some sort of Expert levels with all of these elements at your disposal, mixed with hordes of enemies, would have made a great and more challenging addition.Well worth the price tag, but I reckon most of it will be too easy for fans of the platformer genre.

												You know what? This is a good game. I didn't really expect to like it...I'm not much of a platformer guy, and I originally only had a license because I bought a bundle. But the graphics were interesting enough in a oddly appealing way, and it looked as if it wasn't just constant Mario moments with a bunch of hidden crap that you had to memorize, so I decided to add it to my library instead of trading or gifting it. And man, am I glad that I did.What I got was a thinking man's platformer that includes some really interesting mechanics (especially the many variable ways that your gravity beam can be applied). As the environments change, so do many of the challenges for those levels, so the environments aren't merely eye candy. Everything was achieveable, even if getting to 100% completion on some levels required some pretty diabolical thinking.The controls are tight, graphics are original, and gameplay is solid. I ended up playing every level, and hanging in there to the very end (many platformers make me rage quit 20% of the way through the game, and I have enough other stuff in my library to play that I will often just dump the platform game to play a FPS/RPG/adventure game, which are my primary genres).The only downside to this game? You're left with a bit of a cliffhanger at the end -- an obvious set-up for the next game -- but, to the best of my knowledge, no sequel was ever produced (this game was released in 2011, so it doesn't seem very likely that will ever happen). That's too bad, because I would gladly pay to play the sequel as well.At two bucks, if you like platformers at all, you'd be kind of dumb to pass this one up. This is a really solid game from an independent developer, and I'm happy to hand him my $2 all day long. Great game, Big Fat Alien, and I hope that you decide to follow up BEEP  some day with a sequel. I'd pre-order just to support you. Nice work.			"

												I got BEEP in a puzzle-related game bundle so hard to assess the value vs fair price for me. However, I think I got what I paid for. I love a good platform puzzle game and while BEEP is such a game, I only like it. To start, I had to play in windows-mode only (alt-enter to exit fullscreen) because the fullscreen mode would not cooperate. I spent a good amount of time trying to make it work in fullscreen that I should've just played it in windows-mode the whole time. The graphics are indeed nothing to boast, but cute to a degree. The micro-expressions the beep does when underfire, firing, jumping/etc is amusing (if noted during gameplay). You are given a mini-background story as to why the BEEPs exist and then you appear in a galactic map. It isn't clear where you supposed to go as I ended up flying the ship around the 'galaxy' wondering what to do. It's also funny to me how the ship comes to an abrupt stop when you stop clicking a direction for it to fly to (unrealistic, but in a game were Wall-E's cousin has a better job than him, it doesn't matter).  While the design is fairly easy (WASD/Arrow in combination with the mouse),  the game can be both unforgiving and lenient. If you over-jump even a slightly bit, you are most likely falling to your death. However, if you are jumping and your wheels are able to touch a surface (along the side of the walls or where-ever), you are allowed another chance to jump again to make it (granted, you have to be pretty quick with your reactions to do so). The goal to collect the anti-matter and little gems (25) to get another anti-matter makes it more than just a puzzle platform. Especially so since you do need to collect them to progress the game. Some of the puzzles are very simplistic at the beginning and I believe it'll be so throughout the game since there isn't much combination the game can do with the gravity gun besides just moving the objects around freely/around a pivot piece. Overall, it's a decent game and if you get it in a bundle or stand-alone, you will have some fun time with it. Not a game to finish immediately, but I suggest on the side. 7.5/10.			"

												If you combine platforming from the Mario games, and mix it with the half-life gravity gun and physics, you have BEEP.BEEP is a colorful game about physics and platforming.Pros:Colorful and bright graphics.Amazing puzzles and physics.Picking up random crap and throwing it to kill enemies is the funniest thing ever.Many different levels and worlds, each with their own enviroment.Cons:The physics  can be broken very easily.Not a very good storyline.A few bugs I've ran into, but not very many.There should be a 1-2 second delay between reloading your gun.I would recommend buying this game on a sale  (I got it for around 0.20$ on a sale) because the game goes on sale often.Now, for the rating: I'm giving this game a recommended 6.0 rating, but that's just my personal opinion. I love these types of platformer games, so if you don't like platformers, don't take this rating to heart.Anyway, that's my review.I'm out.          ~Darkel "

												Very good!Genuinely puzzling yet fun levels, at least 4 hours of gameplay. Remarkable physics for an indie game, though totally exploitable to glitch through some of the obstabcles, though that part just adds fun.I would buy this even if it costed more.The graphics are a bit cartoon-ish, more appealing to children, but that's fine.The only downside is - I could not find a settings menu, so I guess you can't change controls and volume.10/10			"

												BEEP is the first title out of BigFatAlien, and judging from the quality of this litle gem, BFA is someone to watch.The core gameplay is always accessible. It is a physics enabled 2D platformer that harkens back to the days of Super Mario and the ilk. It feaures a nice overworld to let you choose levels, and has a simplicity about it that is charming.The BEEP itself is a darned cute character that certainly has my vote for President when he decides to run.Music is top notch, sound design is great, and visuals are styled well and look awesome.Easily worth the money.

												I loved playing it, unfortunately due to a mistake of steam it got refunded.It's great for any platform gamer, it's got this magnety carry system with which you can carry your enemies corpses and throw them into pits or into other enemies.But on to steam's mistakes.I bought the bundle of bundles with beep in it, but one of the games was crap and it said if I would refund that game it would also take down a marble game and a ball shooting game and I would get 4 cents.I was fine with that.But them steam without a warning refunded the whole collection and took beep away from me. unfortunately the bundle is also gone from the sales so I can't get the games that I did want all back together.I guess I'll have to wait to the next sale :( Steam isn't being helpful supportwise either.Never in the entire process of refunding did it mention it would take down the other three bundles in the bundle of bundles. I have now lost a game I loved dearly due to their miscommunication.			"

												BEEP is a simple physics based puzzle platformer. No controller support that I could detect, but the WASD keyboard and mouse controls provide a good degree of control and feel right. You maneuver a little robot that is equipped with a cannon and a tractor beam which allows you to shoot enemies and manipulate objects in the environment in an effort to collect energy crystals. The game also has some fitting sound effects and music for the game's theme. Kind of average--nothing that hasn't been done before.			"

												It's a game where you play a little robot who I imagined is the love child of Wall-e and Eve. The game has puzzles that range from easy to agonizingly easy. It did however play on my love of throwing crap at other crap. If you are going to play it I recommend playing it carelessly (John Rambo style) otherwise there is no challenge, except for the last level which the horrible swinging physics will kill you. There's a hint that there will be a sequel, so hopefully they will ramp up the difficulty and give us a proper ending. Alright, could've been better.			"

Product received for free
												To be honest, for a five hours to complete game its not that bad for a 2$ game, or 50 cents if you get this on sale.Unfortunately, the description is kind of a lie.I was not thinking at all about Yoshi's Island while playing this, granted there might be some similarities due to it being a 2D platformer, and the fact that you have to go through all the levels of the game.The reason is because yoshi's Island was at best a platformer to anything else, and was loved by gamers because of its classic artstyle and the challenge that was always looming around.Also, there were boss stages, which unlike in this game, where while it seemed to have built up to a boss it actually wasn't, and it just add more to how there is a lack of any tension to your journey.Really you're just strolling about and at best nobody would ever need to even check a walkthrough because the game is too simple with how you collect items, as secrets are pretty obvious.That being said I'll give to the devs credit that the physics are definetly impressive and at times I was  genuinely impressed with the possiblities they made with them. Sadly, the said potential is kind of locked for the current stage, and the mechanics are different for each of the four stages, basically giving you something new to work with only to be quickly abandoned. It's quite pointless if you ask me.As for the ""hardcore"", the only part that was a challenge was the last stage, only because there are no checkpoints where it feels like there should be, and I'm pretty sure its where you'd probably quit the game by that point, especially since up to this point the game was fair enough in its challenge, only to bombard you with tiny careful jumps along with deadly fall right at the end.In addition, the only other difficult part is that sometimes puzzles become unbeatable because you might end up accidently throwing the blocks you essentialy need out of your reach, which I feel like they haven't thought it through, and it shows.That being said, the story is not entirely bad (but sure as heck disappointing)  and the graphics are fairly decent for an indie game...Too bad the game already crashed to me once (I think) and at some points did in fact got some major lag for such a minium req. game, and my PC isn't even high-end at best but can still run much bigger games which is why I assume the lag is on the dev's end, plus whenever a  certain enemy explodes it seems to almost tear space and time as it glitches into black boxes everywhere...But hey, if you want to waste 5 hours and dont mind wasting less than a dollar on sale go for it, although if you want to at least seem like you have a decent library of games on your steam account, then you should probably skip this, it's not really worth it.On a quick note I checked one of the dev's blog. If you absolutely hate clifhangers then yeah stay away from this game. These guys ain't making a sequel, and sure as heck don't deserve any positive review just for that.			"

												This game really shows how we can make good 2D Platform/Action in our time.It's the perfect exemple of a SuperMarioBrother-Like that evolved to the better.It's not Super Meat Boy but...The Gameplay is great, the sounds are good, The Graphics are simply awesome, taking you where we couldn't beforeShort and Sweet.The New School of the Old School.A must Play, A must Have.

												BEEP is just not vey interesting and feels very much like a flash game. I didn't find it too bad at first considering the 19 cents I paid, but after an hour or so I was already bored. The gravity gun is not very fun to use and a lot of the game seems to be just stacking stuff so that you can get up. I wouldn't compare it to Yoshi's Island at all.The most annoyng thing about this game is the very robot you play as. It babbles and screeches in a high, annoying voice, and you get to hear gems like ""♥♥♥♥ you"" over and over again when you shoot enemies. But unlike some reviews claim you can disable the sounds and music.			"

												The game in and of itself is decent. However, with no available settings or options I find it hard to recommend.  If you dislike being stuck in fullscreen at a relatively low resolution, with no options to go windowed or change controls, then this isn't a game for you. If that's not a problem for you, then sure, go at it if you find it in a sale.			"

												A gorgeous little game where you play as a jumping and flying little WALE*E robot. I played it for about an hour, but then I fell asleep. In that hour, I had loads of fun playing this cute game. I highly reccomend this if you have a rough internet connection, or none at all, as it can keep you occupied for hours on end. Things I don't like: *The ""rogue"" robots, they die too quickly.*The unlimited ammo on you and the ""rogue"" robots, it just gets a little unbalanced.*The death screen, It could be a little less ""horrifying"", instead of the ""YOU ARE DEAD :("" It could instead be replaced with a soft depressing jingle, along with a little less dramatic or terrible death screen.7/10			"

												I don't know where to start with this review. I started playing smaller indiegames not that long ago and I'm totally addicted to it. BEEP is one of that little games that just is totally worth it's small price. The only reason that I write this review is that this game really deserves to be bought.Pro's Great straightforward platformer, with easy controls The game is divided in several planets, each with his own colourful setting that creates great div With the easy controls, every planet still manages to bring new possibilities with that controls. The game has enough savepoints in the levels to make it a casual game, not so much that there is no difficulty anymore. The story of the game is great for such a small game.Con's This platformer does never require very quick, skilled actions. If you are really into difficult games, just let this pass. I myself do think this game is really well balanced. I just finished the game (7,4 hours) and I would still like to play more levels. Can't wait to see what the developers will come up with next.This game is really worth it's price. If it's on sale, really, everyone should just buy and try it. "

												I felt the same exact pleasure playing this game that I had playing Yoshi's island, or portal, or super mario brothers 3. It combines every unique element a platformer should have in order to create a game that not only gives a great sense of nostalgia for nintendo kids like me, but also gives it's OWN style of whacky, intriguing and mind-boggling challenges/puzzles. And with the game having OH SO MUCH personality, color, and a generally happy-go-lucky feel, I highly reccomend trying it out.			"

												Overall: BEEP is a cute little puzzle platformer that I'm sure can run on even the most rotten of potatoes, and while you maybe run into technical issues with monitors or odd frame dips. if you don't run into any of the previous stated issues, this game seems great for kids.Platformer: BEEP as a puzzle platformer is decent, from what I played, it's nothing too challanging, but I'm sure it gets more difficult as you go from world to world as stated by other reviews.Performance: BEEP despite seeming simple does not come without its flaws, technical issues haunt this game like odd frame dips, holding around the 30's, to monitors issues like the game going to stretched full screen with multi-monitor setups. I'm not saying you will for sure run into these issues, nor am I saying there are not solutions to them, just know before buying, you are not safe from them.Appeal: While I can not say to a grown adult ""hey, go buy this game"", I can say this game is great for kids with the simple, ultra cute art style, easy controls and low spec requirements.

The game feels decent, it feels slightly like one of those free flash games you'd find on the internet though but generally it's a nice experience that I'm sure many enjoy. If it's onsale for a price similar to what I bought it at, get it. I don't think I would buy it for 3.99 though.			"

												BEEP is a game that pleasantly surprised me. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with a $0.19 price tag, but this game really managed to grab my attention. Essentially you're contolling an endless fleet of robots that are exploring various planets and searching for ""matter"". At your disposal you have a gravity gun that allows you to manipulate objects as well as a machine gun for dealing with enemies and traps. In addition, you may find other tools to use on each planet, such as a rocket fueling pad that allows you to fly. Here are my overall thoughts:Pros:-It controls very well for the most part. The gravity gun can have a few hiccups at times, but otherwise the game functions as intended.-The enemies and other obsticles give the game a bit of challenge, although the game is very forgiving with checkpoints, infinite lives, and no loss of collectibles upon death at the same time.-The puzzles that this game presents allow the player to be somewhat creative by allowing them to manipulate a majority of objects in the environment.Cons:-The art style is very simple and not extremely detailed. The game's environments are, for the most part, plain.-The music is not very memorable.-Enemy placement forces the game to be played very slowly, but the game's forgiving nature provides no sense of urgency. Essentially this makes the game feel very slow at some points.Overall, I would say that BEEP is definitely a good game for casual play. It can be rather relaxing, in fact. While it is rather simplistic and minimalistic, that adds a certain charm to its overall presentation, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it at its sale price, although at full price I'm on the fence.			"

												Got it with Developer Alliance Bundle for something like 0.99 $ on summer sale. Died about 100 times and got about 13 hours of gameplay on completion (ok i suck at it). + The controls are tight (keyboard + mouse combination) and platforming action is decent. + Physics is unassailable. You could try all kinds of weird stuff in game without the engine complaining or acting out.+ Initially the gameplay seemed too easy, but eventually the difficulty ramps up(especially towards the end). Challenges are not very hard though.+ There may be more than one way to get past an obstacle.+ Enemies are nice, and each have their own unique strengths, quirks, and weakness, which is not immediately apparent. It may be a while before you figure out how to kill an enemy. Again several approaches are possible. + Some twist  or break in gameplay on different levels, maybe a new weapon, power,  enemy, new kind of environmental  hazard. Doesn't get monotonous.+ Music is ok. I liked the weird arab/oriental/fusion track in the ice planet.- Graphics are meh. Simple, cartoony, flash-like. I don't mind those things. Its not poorly done or anything like that but overall it doesn't come together to build a suitable feel or atmosphere. Each planet (of which there are 3) has it's own climate/environment. The last planet is the better of the three. The world, ominous music, come together nicely to give good atmosphere. The creepy firebreathing monster in that planet is a nice touch.- No real story or setting. This could have made the game more interesting or provided reward for progression.Overall. This puzzle platformer was competant if forgetable. Passing a stage while collecting all the lums - or whatever it is we are supposed to collect- is a good way to while away 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price and not unworthy of your time either. Get it if it comes on sale.			"

												I got it on sale for $.20, and it was worth it. It's a fun platformer you can play when you're bored, but sometimes it can get too repetitive. It's a short game, so don't spend too much money on it because it doesn't last too long. With some more development, this will be a really good game.			"

												My friend got me this as a joke for Christmas. It's actually a well made physics platformer with a surprising level of challenge.If you enjoy platformers, buy it. If you don't enjoy platformers, it's so cheap you may as well try it.I guess you could say it's pretty BEEPing good :^D			"

												This is a fairly charming and playable platforming and puzzle game, with a satisfying difficulty curve and a decent variety of puzzles. The controls are simple to master and the platforming is mostly forgiving, due to Beep's high degree of mid-air manoeuvrability and tendency to stick to platforms with its treads. Deaths were infrequent and usually fair, so frustration never really crept in.There are often a number of ways to deal with enemies and solve puzzles, mostly due to the games somewhat wonky but effective physics engine and the gravity gun. This tool allows you to sling objects (and enemies) all over the place and is the basis for most of the puzzles.Ultimately, its not the most polished game you will find, but its a steal for $2 and I enjoyed it to the end.

												I recently bought this game to keep my steam market alive and have come to the realisation that it is not halfway bad!When you start the game you get a neat introduction and you start right off by choosing the levels.I discovered that each level carries their own little challenges and there are usually more than one way of soving them.The physics aspect of the game is nice. Simply a game to cool down after a stressful day or game.Overall the game is highly playable, for the low price of 0.99 € (0.49 € sale in my case) you get to play a neat little game which, in it's own right, gives you a lot of playtime and enriches your steam library with yet another game.I haven't encountered a glitch or bug yet. And if I do, I don't mind. The pricetag is hilariously low for anyone to ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.Cheers to the devs, keep on going, games are not easy to make.			"

												In this game you’ll control the eponymous Beep bot in search for energy blobs around the galaxy, a simple setup for a platform game. While you might take this as a small budget indie game, this is actually much better polished than any flash game you’ll find flooding the net. The animation is smooth and the stages are smartly designed, not only will you find it a challenge to complete each stage perfectly, you’ll have to devise your own strategies in doing so as well.The protagonist is essentially a clone of Wall-E given Gordon’s gravity gun, but the mechanics used is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the entire game. You’ll use rocks to block incoming projectiles and you’ll use your enemies’ miniature carcasses to activate switches. When all else fails, you can always jet pack your way out while gunning down bots with your machine gun; like a boss.Another twist came from Beep’s partial immortality, since the mothership can churn out any number of bots as it wished and beam it down to the last checkpoint. Beep is by and large, expendable. This means you can be free to explore the stages as you wish, completing areas via some bizarre manners manipulating the physics engine.If you can’t tell by now I’m totally recommending this game, with its low price tag and the aforementioned features, there is no reason why you shouldn’t give this a chance.

The world design, the level selection, the characters, the hints, even the death screen. Also, this game has the most satisfying mechanic of picking up your fallen enemies and doing as you please. Wheather that be throwing them away or stacking them up to get to higher places, the gravity gun is one of the most genius things ever and it works so smoothly. The platforms are super fun to jump onto and move around with the gravity gun and the world is just overall fun to move around despite being linear. There is so much detail in this game that dirt specs fly when you ride over grass, but they aren't at all distracting. I love this game so much, and if you do not have it yet, get it. Now.			"

												Side scrolling & Rage inducing, two of the most addictive things about games today.It has several planets, each planet containing different levels. In the game you play as BEEP, BEEP is a small robot which has a Zero Point Energy Manipulator and a cannonball launcher, you are up against several different enemies, these include; a Robot, Zappy fish, Allhau Akbar robot, and many more! There are several types of levels including; Desert Levels, grassland Levels, Ice Levels and Lava Levels! Flying through space in your little rocket ship, choosing from the levels, gradually getting more and more difficult, enemies aim getting better and a less defined goal. The soundtrack belonging to this game is also calming, it is space age music, but relaxing.As if 2001: A space oddesy & Wall:E had a child, this would be it!

												BEEP is a good little platformer that would be awesome if it had controller support. It also lacks a menu, meaning no settings of any kind. These 2 things really keep BEEP from being a great platformer. Platformers are meant to be played with a controller, imo and  settings(windowed mode, sound) are nice options to have too. As is 5/10, would be 8/10 if it was complete.  "

												The biggest problem with this game is that it's unpolished. The main feature, the physics beam, is awkward to control, and it lets go at the most inconvinient times. The art is inconsistent and underwhelming. I'm not sure, but I think I could have done most of the art assets in MS Paint. And the semi-realistic gold nugget looking things are supposed to be antimatter? Please, just do a Google search and find a better asset. The same few enemies and bits of terrain are also resued over and over, which results in a boring, static experience. There is very little challenge and no penalty for failure. If you die, the only thing you lose is time off your life as you respawn at the latest checkpoint with no golden antimatter nuggets missing and the enemies respawned.This obviously makes it very easily to cheese some antigold nuggets by suicide-jumping them. The reload feature is instant - just press ""R"" - and you never stop shooting. It may as well not be there at all for how much it impacts gameplay. There are some good bits, of course, but not enough to justify the full $5 price. Honestly, I've seen better games written in Flash for my browser.			"

												I do recommend this game, but play it at your own risk. It's ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. The third level from World 6 is the hardest level from a video game I have ever played (I know World 6 is the last world meaning that level is technically the second last level, but still). And yes, that includes COCKING DARK SOULS AND HOTLINE MIAMI!If I gave this game a difficulty score between 1-10, this game would be 12. DS would be 11 and HM would be 10.Even world 2 was stupidly hard.			"

The Brave Little Toaster Rebooted - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Among all of the reeking filth of Steam's bargain bins, full of poorly designed garbage purely there to rake in a steady stream of nickels and dimes from unsuspecting customers, there is the occasional game that's not too bad. Some of them are decent. Sure, for a little more you could afford a real game and play something a lot nicer. But sometimes a brother gotta eat off the dollar menu a little.Out of all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I've carelessly spent precious coins on that I could've been whipping at unsuspecting homeless people, one game sticks out as pretty alright.Beep.Beep is alright.According to the developers, who are apparently ex-Bioware and Lucasarts employees, Beep is ""Inspired by games such as Cave Story, Yoshi’s Island, Trine and Half-Life 2"". Some pretty big names you're throwing around there, man. You sure your little dollar game can hold up?Well, okay there buddy.Let's get some things straight here now.Beep is a basic, although charming puzzle platformer. You roll around as a little robot, collecting nuggets of moon♥♥♥♥♥♥to ground up and snort off the cheapest space hooker's♥♥♥♥♥you can. Your purpose is to collect, but every stage will have an end zone to reach as well.Now, let's be real here. What were you guys doing at Bioware and Lucasarts? Not knocking your game here, it's very nice. But something tells me you're not the brains behind things like Mass Effect or the original Star Wars Battlefront. You sure you guys worked AT Bioware and Lucasarts? You weren't like, washing windows outside? You sure you didn't just look in the window one day, make eye contact with an uncomfortable game programmer, and feel a special little connection or something? You weren't the unpaid intern picking up wank napkins while they were doing the motion capture for the alien strip club dancers in Mass Effect were you?Just checking, bud.Because something tells me that this isn't really something up the usual Bioware or Lucasarts fan's alley. Yeah, sure, I love me some Bioware games or some Star Wars games. But this is a toaster with wheels that rolls around with a gravity gun, yelling ""♥♥♥♥ you"" in a chipmunk voice whenever it blows up an enemy. This isn't an epic RPG or an immersive shooter. I think you're just kinda throwing names around to make it seem like you're a big deal.Beep is a great game, for its price. It's really kinda hard to see where it's getting a lot of its inspiration from, aside from the gravity gun mechanics which are pretty much directly ripped from Trine and Half-Life.You'll be tasked with finding three big space turds and many smaller space turdlets floating around each level. Collecting up all of the small ones will equal a big one. So you just need to collect a lot of things. I can see how this is mildly inspired by Yoshi's Island, seeing as how there's an emphasis on collecting. But it kinda misses the greater beauty of Yoshi's Island. Once you grab a rock in Beep, you have it. If you die right after, you still have it. If you leave the level, you still have it. You don't need to collect it again.It doesn't really feel much like it was building on what Yoshi had so much as it is copying a small part of a greater concept. The same with all of its other inspirations, like Cave Story and the rest. It feels like they just borrowed some fun concepts from other games without really considering what made them great in the first place, and cobbling them together to make a simple little platformer.It's not a bad game. I had a lot of fun with it, actually. It's a simple little platformer, but it's put together pretty well.While it might be rather unremarkable and bland compared to many other platformers, it's still designed very well. It has a gentle difficulty curve, and makes great use of multiple gimmicks that each world is based off of. New hazards are introduced and built on very well, and the action never gets particularly stale.While it is obviously clear why the game is so cheap once you start playing it, the amount of content packed in for the price is also fair. The game's incredibly basic, geometric art style is simple, but it's not off-putting. It looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Flash game, yeah. Fair point. But it doesn't look BAD. It just looks, you know, cheap and kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's some decent ambient effects in later levels to fancy things up a bit. So it's not like it's all bad. Everything else kinda follows that same pattern. Kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but not bad. Most of the game's mechanics are borrowed, and they're nowhere near executed on par with or better than where they originated. But it's not an unpleasant experience.It's not a long game, but it's better that way. Stretching its material thinner would have made the game an unbearable chore. But as a short, simple game that one could knock out in a couple hours, it's really a fun little thing. It's satisfying to use the gravity to throw enemies around, and puzzles are usually require some mild figuring. Nothing grand or elaborate, but you're not paying for grand and elaborate here.It's clearly cheaply made, but it's also made well. There's some craftsmanship in there. Somewhere. Like a dollar menu sandwich that a greasy teen took the trouble of jacking off into, because he wanted you to eat ♥♥♥♥ that bad. He risked his job for you. He put his minimum wage job on the line. Can you imagine if he got fired? He wouldn't be able to afford those Beats headphones he wants so bad. They're the headphones all the real rappers use, like him. He grew up on the streets of the suburbs. But he would throw it all away for you.Beep is alright. I wouldn't say it's perfect. I wouldn't say it's great. Maybe it's good. But if there's something I can say with 100% certainty, it's that this game is alright.If you ate at home for once instead of wasting all of your money on fast food, you could use those extra couple bucks to buy this game you fat ♥♥♥♥. It could be a nice change of pace, and unlike fast food it probably won't hasten the inevitable onset of erectile dysfunction.Probably.			"

YouTube™ Video: Beep 

			Views: 8		

			MrWindblade brings you another episode of his Steam Catalog Project with BEEP. It's a physics based platformer with a gravity manipulator and really floaty jump physics.		

The first 30 minutes of gameplay are contained in the video.So far, BEEP is a decent platformer with some clever use of physics, but it's really not my cup of tea.  I found the core platforming mechanics to be too floaty, and I don't care for the BEEP robot's design or animations.Given that the game is an indie title and operated mostly bug-free (save for the need to change my audio channels from 8 to 6 to prevent crashing) I can give these few small complaints a pass and offer a thumbs up to fans of the genre.One caveat, however - if you're looking for a platformer that offers something new or innovative, I don't believe that BEEP is what you're looking for.

												A cool platformer with some puzzle elements. It controls well for most of the time, has a good progression through 24 levels divided into 6 ""worlds"", and it's fun to play. It's not difficult, although some parts can be a bit frustrating. But most collectibles are mandatory, so they feel a little pointless. They should be just collectables to unlock extra stuff. But what's here is worth 5-6 hours of good content. Some achievements would also be appreciated.			"

												This is a 2-D physics, puzzles, shooter and platformer.BEEP is a Wall-E like robot kind that have a gun and a gravity like gun. You need to stack, pull and grab your way across three plantets with two sides to them each. Fight the KREEP and find out what is going on. This is a 2-D platformer with puzzle and some shooting. You can throw your enemys at other enemys to kill them and some need more then your gun. Reload with E, This game is without voice acting and platforms will deliver the story. This is a shortish cute game that is kinda low priced but if you fancy yourself a puzzler or want to get into it then this might be an easy entry path. For all ages, no blood. You got 8 hp, if you die another BEEP will take your place at the checkpoint. Even I managed to complete it 100 %. No achievements but you can complete it but there is no completon bonus. I hope you found this helpful.Have fun, enjoy and BEEP them all :)			"

												BEEP is a puzzle game where you solve puzzles with a gravity gun and kill a bunch of evil robot thingys which are... being evil in the star system your BEEP-Ship has discovered. Your BEEPs must explore 2 very different zones across the each 3 planets in the system collecting anti-matter along the way. Each zone is 4 levels long and each level and zone increases in difficulty. Each level has 3 chunks  and 25 nuggets of anti-matter. Collecting all 25 nuggets will award you a fourth chunk. Anti-matter allows you to unlock new zones providing you've completed all the levels in the previous zone. You will traverse methane oceans, volcanic valleys, a purple forest and death, so much death. You can get a total of 96 chunks of anti-matter although you only need 60 to unlock the final zone. At the end it's hinted there may be a sequel!Paragraphs? What are those?Rating: 9/10 because I get angry when I die.			"

YouTube™ Video: Bee boo boo bop 

			Views: 553,793		

			Boo boo... beep bop?		

(In case the video gets taken down:  Beep boo boo bop?  Boo boo...beep bop?  Not beep boo boo beep?  BOP?  BEEP?!  BOO BOO BOP!!!! )Game's pretty good.  Got it for a massive discount and finished it already.  If you've played Yoshi's Island and/or Trine, the gameplay will seem VERY familiar.   It's like being locked in Amadeus (wizard) mode on Trine, which isn't a bad thing.My only problem include the puzzles and platforming areas in the last few levels along with a dreadful framerate lag which made some areas hard to play until the framerate stablized.  The game is also fairly short.  5-6 hours will lead to the game's completion.Not a bad game.   If you find it on sale, I'd recommend trying it out.8/10			"

												BEEP, is a funny Plattformer, Puzzle and Brain game.It´s was fun playing it even if i do not personally like that Art of game. (i´m a Fast Paced Action lover)Still BEEP was so far one of rare games that i would play some hour´s (until i get frustrated because i somehow being very bad on such games)It doesnt really has Story. It´s more like short explains about BEEP´s Skills in the levels (There are those ""info plattform"")Controls were good i do not had any problem´s with my Mouse and keyboard playing it!Graphics are good. Emeny´s make you think about how to get not killed or get the Tresure´s you can collect.In overall i would say play it and make your own opinion about this game!Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:Gameplay: 8/10 (Well made)Graphics: 6/10 (serve´s the meaning for the game and it fits good with the effects etc)Support: ?/10 (never had to go support)Price: 7/10 (5€ seems fine to me)Story: 3/10 (There isn´t really much about to say)Sound: 7/10 (like the Graphic´s it serve´s the Gameplay as well in a good way! like having a Jet to Fly with it´s effects)Performance: 10/10 (no problem´s @ all) FAZIT: 6.8/10 (well made game, but it could contain more Story in it for better gameplay and more Addiction for the game, as it really has good gameplay!)

												There are a few issues that I have w/ this game.First of all, Initially when I started the game, I couldn't play it. It was full screen and everything, however when I attempted to move my cursor to click 'next', an invisible box of sorts was locking me in the top left corner. So for a while I didn't play this game. When I again tried to, Instead of blocking my cursor, My screen only showed one fourth of the game, the top left corner. I had to search up how to put the game in windowed mode to even be able to play it.Second of all, there are no settings at all. not for sound, resolution, or anything like that. The game itself is actually completely fine, but the developers have almost completely disregarded the posibilities of the differently equipped systems that this game should be able to run on.So basically this entire thing is me complaining about how the it doesn't work 100% on my computer, and they should have some kind of configuration in it. because without it this game is very unapealing.fix it please.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Platforming game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a Mouse Speed slidebar available.There is a Music Volume slidebar available.There is a Sound Volume slidebar available.There are 3 different save files available.About the game.You are a little robot, with a small hover jet and some machine gun. It's Some sort of a mario game, because you have to collect coins and 3 stars and it is a platforming game. You have unlimited lives and you will get the option to go back to the last checkpoint. You also have a weapon to move objects, like dead robot bodies. You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D. If you are leaving in the middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and you no longer have to worry about it anymore. Checkpoints however are lost. You are also able to move some platform with the ""Anti grav"", which is required to pass things.Graphics are a bit.. Cartoonish?? It's not high detailed same goes for the background.The music is calm.The Game is calm.Game has some Puzzle elements.If you are in a dark area, your light lamp will turn on and the light is well done though.Other things.None atm.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10			"

												In BEEP, you are in control of a small robot that is used to explore other planets. It is mostly a platform game with slight action and puzzle elements. There are basically zero options provided to the player as far as graphics are concerned, and the game engine seems to have serious problems with frame drops and performance on a modern computer. The general presentation is basic, upbeat, lighthearted, adorable, and for all ages. The world map is amusing, as you are allowed to navigate through space with your ship and bounce off asteroids or space debris. Each planet looks different than the other, and the levels appear to have been designed well. The controls are implemented adequately, and are quite responsive even in the more dire platforming situations mixed in with some shooting or the tricky anti-gravity device. The robot's wheels also have an excellent grasp on terrain, which makes for some forgiving moments if you are new to the genre. All of this is not without some major problems related to performance. The game runs terribly on a modern computer that more than meets the minimum requirements. The massive frame drops, excessive lag, terrible slowdowns, and extreme choppiness make it unplayable. Others have experienced similar problems, and proof of it can be found in the game's Steam forum. This is actually quite unfortunate, as BEEP seems to be a good game at its core, if it weren't for the performance issues that break it. Perhaps with some developer tweaks and patches, BEEP will live up to its full potential and be enjoyable.BEEP is mediocre.			"

												BEEP has very little going for it. The overworld serves little purpose in the hour that I've played other than to make it take slightly longer to select levels and is overall awful. Once you get into a level the aesthetics are unappealing to say the least. The background and characters are cartoonish, but don't have any particular thing that grabs you about them, but the pickups (antimatter nuggets and cores or something) look like bad gif files of 3D modeling done by high school students.The music and sound I can't comment on as I turned them off within 3 minutes of getting in to the game. As far as the mechanics go the controls are sluggish and sometimes not responsive and the camera is attached to the cursor but not smoothly and you can easily get motion sick from the jitteriness of it.It isn't a terrible game but there are so many other better examples of interesting platformers that I cannot recommend this one.

												Just another unpolished, probably unfinished platformer. It felt like one of the games I would play for 5 minutes on AddictingGames as a kid. The art style is inconsistent throughout the game, and sometimes it feels like they didn’t even try. The gameplay isn’t anything special and the only redeeming feature, aside from it’s somewhat ok lighting and physics engine, is the anti-gravity beam, which only seems to work when it wants to and likes to drop things a lot.I would never pay a full $5 for this, but it might be worth it to someone else to sell a couple cards when it’s on sale for $0.19. In the end, I’d just recommend you go and play some free flash games or something instead.			"

												And yet another platformer which I'd love except for the controls. Come on, devs, if you expect me to do a skill jump while waving a robot around on a grabber beam (2-2, 2nd ""supergrain""), the least you could do is to make sure that:- Movement and grabber can be fine-controlled, separately- The grabber doesn't accidentally release the robot (in like 50% of the cases)- Once held in an orientation, the robot doesn't randomly revolve, exposing me to the big bad laser beamI like challenging setups, but the challenge shouldn't be hoping for the lucky situation where all controls work properly at the same time. Also, on a multi-try challenge, spending one minute to get back again from the last checkpoint tends to grate after a while.It may be harsh, but I'll keep giving non-recommendations to any game which frustrates the player by control inadequacies - no matter how good the other aspects are.

												I spent the first 10 minutes in mode A flying around the universe wondering what the BEEP am I doing wrong. Once I figured it out I got to the platform side of things where I found it very enjoyable. I am not big on platform games but this one I could make an exception for. This is like a little hidden gem that everyone should try at least once and for the lovely price of 19 cents, how can you pass it up.			"

												I typically don't like hard video games, so this review might be biased. And, my definition of hard might be easy for someone else, so there's that too. I bought this game for the full price in India (55 Rupees). If you get it on an offer on the bundle (was on sale for 23 Rupees with three other games), then you can make your money back just with trading cards (and that's how this game got so many positive reviews). With the above in mind, here's my review:The game, as such, was too hard for me. The story was not a story, just mere reasons on why you had to go out and control the bots. The monsters/enemy robots/whatever they're called are way too powerful. Many of them can't be destroyed and fire at you a lot. The game has a demo on the game's website for three levels. The fourth one was OK, but the fifth was down-right impossible in my opinion. The first three levels, on the other hand, were extremely easy. The difficulty curve is not a curve at all. it went from easy to impossible in no time flat. Also, the game introduces new mechanics at an alarming pace, with little to no explanation on how they work. No training wheels, nothing (Portal: First Slice was far better). The graphics are OK, but by no means good. To be honest, even the game ""Thomas was Alone"" looks better (or at least I think so). The ""Bonk"" engine is not so good at physics either. In my opinion, the developer could've easily used Unity or even a tool like Stencyl. The controls are non-remappable, so you're stuck with WASD/Arrow Keys. Also, right-clicking to reload is a bad idea. Why can't we just use the E key? All-in-all, the game could use a lot of work and in it's current stage, don't recommend it to anyone who wants a game to play.Want to make money? Buy it on a sale and sell your cards. Want to play? Look into something else.			"

												I've never seen a game with this many hardware compatibility issues. Take a look at the forums, nearly half the threads there are people asking for help because the game won't start. Why? Maybe it doesn't like your sound settings, or your particular brand of headphones, or your monitor resolution, or the fact that you have a controller plugged in.			"

												Worst game ever seen in the history of selling games. Maniability awful (target system and inerty extremely bad), soundtrack bad (I played with my music), no comment for graphics, and this is the concept of a flash game (some flash games are better AND FREE), I didn't see any fun in this game, but some people did, so maybe try it. If you want to rage and be frustated (I learnt I could be the most important rageous guy cause this game), buy it ONLY when it solded (0.19) but i advise you to go on Miniclip it's still better. It's a shame to sell this game 5 euros.... =/ And when some ennemies exploded, several big black square appear on your screen (=bug) and when plateforms become small, you can't see it cause these buggies. A shame0.5/20 because there are plateforms			"

It's a lot like Super Mario Bros., but you're a robot that shoots rocks instead of a short, fat, Italian dude with a handlebar mustache. On sale I would definitely recommend it, but even a full price it's still pretty good.			"

												This game was surprisingly awesome! I got it free cause it was on sale for .19 and gave cards for .21. Still, I thought it would be another freebie game to get cards from but this game was really fun. A bit on the short side, but totally worth it. It basically is Mario mixed with WALL E. Its a great mixture of platforming and puzzling. I like how its challenging enough to keep me engaged but not too hard to make me pull my hair out. The puzzles were a bit straightforward but took thinking to complete. Plus the environment, music and ambiance were very soothing. Totally worth the 2 cents I earned to play it and I think you should play it too. I hope they make a sequel. They should be proud of what they accomplished.			"

												This game is a GREAT platformer. Different than the stereotypical one because you can use/alter/destroy a portion of your surroundings and there are lots of puzzles to solve. The only thing that could possibly make this game better would be steam achievements, since some of the puzzles are quite difficult, and it would feel good to get an achievement for some of them, or general accomplishments.

												Pros:- Makes you want to do speedruns.- Has the platform feel you look for.- Grabbing thing and throwing them around is fun!Cons:- Gets you easily bored because of too many repeated objectives.- Aim-lock sometimes may end up aim-locking you away from your target. (Considered moving around)- Doesn't have a speed option for doing speed runs.- Graphics could really use an upgrade.There's room for improvement for this game. But overall it didn't appeal me as much to keep me going with playing (Played until 4th level).			"

Product received for free
												Although cheap at the price of $1.00, this game gives very little  even for the small price tag. The game has nothing to offer, it's bland and holds no real cards, and if it does it doesn't play them when it should (I.E to grab my intrest). It's  ""My first game"" should go on newgrounds not on steam. Don't buy, not worth your time.			"

												Pros:- Makes you want to do speedruns.- Has the platform feel you look for.- Grabbing thing and throwing them around is fun!Cons:- Gets you easily bored because of too many repeated objectives.- Aim-lock sometimes may end up aim-locking you away from your target. (Considered moving around)- Doesn't have a speed option for doing speed runs.- Graphics could really use an upgrade.There's room for improvement for this game. But overall it didn't appeal me as much to keep me going with playing (Played until 4th level).			"

												How many times can one game crash?If the game is Beep, let's just say my playtime may read 8 minutes, but I've been at it for 20.At $0.19 I feel I got a bad deal.MY THRILLING INDIE EXPERIENCE:- Launch game- Reach main menu- Set it to windowed- It crashes immediately- Relaunch game- Set it to windowed at splash screen- It works. Amazing! What a time to be alive.- Game proceeds to crash at any provocation from dying to hitting the escape key to just because it feels like it- Have to re-window the game every launch because it never remembers- Decide it's just not worth the hassle to try to wring $0.19 cents worth of fun out of this basic♥♥♥♥♥flash gameJust go on the marketplace and buy a baller emote instead like a mouse with a hat or a sleeping goat.

												Well I was expecting BEEP to be a lot worse that it looks like at first glance - yet another 2D platformer. Still, the controls aren't insultingly clunky, and the artwork, while really low effort, isn't the worst I've seen either.Should you buy BEEP, then?  No, not really.  It's got fewer flaws than most 2D platformers, but neither is it the king of the genre. Also, technical problems prevent the game from being run under Windows 10 if you have a high res display and use DPI (required if your PPI is at or near retina level).   Overscan means you can only access 1/4 of the screen with your mousepointer in full screen mode - you have to run it windowed. So, while not worth buying, it's worth acknowledging the game is polished enough to be tolerable, meaning at least some of the developers on the project could achieve greater things in future.			"

Îmi place aceste tipuri de jocuri platformer, deci, dacă nu vă place platformers, nu iau acest rating la inimă.

												Games like this make me appreciate the classic SNES ""Super Mario World"" even more. Only played the first 6 missions and i got bored of the mechanics. Puzzles seem thrown in for diversity, but end up being annoying, repetitive and a chore (push A, move past B, go back to unpush A otherwise C won't open). If you die in the process, you end up repeating a puzzle again and again.Graphics are mixed, some textures make sense, others seem out of place. Animation is pretty minimal. Wish the would have polished it more. Some people compare it to a free flash game and i don't think that's an advantage. At least the physics mechanics is fun when you use the tractor beam to throw rocks at enemies or the flying metal fish out of the way instead of shooting for its dome head. Wish i could do the same with the one-wheel pew-pews, but the gun locks on and you can’t use the tractor beam anymore.Music ok at first, biome specific and becomes repetitive after the biomes first two missions. Sound? Pew-pew, pow-pow.Overall? For the price it would make a nice midweek gift but not for Christmas. Buy it only if you’re bored of your Steam selection or really really like platformers. I would save my money and buy Trine during Steam Sales, at least you can co-op it locally.			"

												This is just one of those games where you can tell games journalists, the so called ""professionals"" are full of it, likely full of the money they're stuffed with to write their reviews, something that indie developers can't do. Look at those reviews, just look at them, now compare those with reviews from the same sources of puzzle games with AAA puzzle games that are markedly worse. - This is a fantastic little game, it has character, and it has charm, the developers clearly cared about what they were creating and the puzzles are a lot of fun. What we need to realise is that we don't need a commercially branded character to enjoy a game or find a cute little game hero charismatic. It's just kind of sad that this game is getting 70%s instead of 90%s because the character is an unknown rather than, say, Mario or Pokemon. What a sad state of affairs.			"

												BEEP has great promise in every aspect of it's game, even to the point where I was expecting it to have hairline accuracy with it's controls.That is however one thing that you must not assume. When you aim at an enemy it auto-locks, great for shooting under cover, bad for tracking moving enemies. In this case every enemy killable, moves. Sometimes it locks at an angle where the bullets you shoot will miss regardless of where you stand, making some scenarios only passable if you lose one block of your health.But onto the good part! I never found any puzzle that were the same. Some made me feel stupid, whereas some made me feel like a genius in the making, but no two puzzles were the same. Every obsticle you encounter is one you must figure out by yourself, whether you do it by stacking the mangled scraps of your enemies, or by propelling yourself upwards by using the tracer beam to slam the corpses up onto the underside of your BEEP.Every ""Planet"" biome has their own theme and puzzle styles that never borrow from the previous planets, allowing a fresh experience every time you move from one biome to the next. Definite plus.This is a puzzle gameIt also feels like a rage game at times.no.It's a rage game.Also I hate the insufferable flying mines that chase you....			"

												I bought this game as part of a bundle, a very bad bundle. this is the best game in the bundle but thats not saying much since the other three games in the bundle are abysmal. This is basically a cutesy casual platformer that gives you the gravity gun from HL2 but suffers from bad level design, an uninspiring barely existant story, no boss battles, and a few bugs. There are better platformer games out there to buy.			"

												At first I truly enjoyed the game but after a bunch of levels, it became mundane. BEEP eventually felt like an unpolished platformer due to its flash-like graphics and exploitable physics. It was also baffling for me that there was no option menu especially for those times when the game glitches in choosing the correct resolution. The ideas were whole but the cohesion of all the elements weren't quite there; it looked complete but slowly fell apart as I progressed through.			"

												I disliked this game very much, not for any of the aesthetics, that doesnt' really phase me. I dislike it because it handles very poorly. Every object is as light as a feather, flying any which way at the slightest lateral movement. However, your gravity gun is extremely weak and makes it hard to manuever and it doesn't really get easier with time. It gets very frustrating very easily after a few levels and the respawn time (about 5 seconds) is way too much between deaths for a platformer like this where dying and restarting are necessary to explore the levels and how to deal with them. For the price (especially on sale) it's not awful, may as well be free, but I still with I could get my money back. Oh well, interesting concept, wish it had been done better.			"

												This game is quite simple and I don't have to write a complicated review for this. In BEEP, robots discover new planets and you have to get all asteroids in the map to get a good score on the level, while shooting and manipulating objects in the map to get through your way to the end. For $0.19 cents, it was worth a buy.8/10			"

												I got this game for 18 cents, so that will probably affect my review.BEEP is a platformer with puzzle elements, I wouldn't call it a puzzle-platformer because of the puzzles revolve around you moving stuff around with a gun that lets you move objects. The art style, which was said in other reviews isn't consistant, it has decent looking 3D orbs (you collect these every level to unlock new ones) but then the background to the hills look like something out of a flash game.The most annoying thing about this game is wonky controls, you have to right click on the bot to reload, which is counter-intuitive when you're shooting at an enemy. This game is decent, should entertain you for an hour or two. I'd recommend it on sale but otherwise it's not worth the full price.			"

NOTE: In my experience of playing this game, I have found it to be quite childish.  Though I say that, I do recommend anyone interested in the genre should purchase & play it.It's a pretty cute little game from what I saw in my total of six minutes and having only completed the first level.  It was well executed and quite charming.  It also seems very expansive from the level selection screen and the amount of content already offered on a 5-minute, tutorial first level.It appeared too childish for my taste, but there don't seem to be any problems with it, so I am suggesting it.  I hope that if you buy it, you enjoy it, or apply for a refund before it's too late.  Good luck.			"

												BEEP is a simple platformer. At a glance, this looks like a run-of-the-mill Mario or Sonic knockoff. However, BEEP is an entirely different type of platformer than others. I personally despise the genre, but I picked up the title for $0.19 regardless. I thought I'd try it for a couple minutes, hate it, and return it. However, I was laughing hard for a good hour. BEEP is extremely fun, the jet-propulsion is an amazing concept to introduce to a platformer. One of the best parts about this game is the gravity gun. You can swing enemies back in forth hilariously with it. The best part about this small game is the soundtrack. The music this game is set to is soothing and intriguing. And the sound effects are ever great. Typical robot sound effects sound annoying, but BEEP's sounds are simple and not too high pitched. This makes the game so inviting. I wouldn't buy this game at $5, because it goes on sale for $0.19 so often. The game takes a few days to complete even if you play diligently, so it's not like you play it for an hour or so and the game is complete. If you have a dollar in your Steam account, there's no reason to pick this title up when it's on sale.			"

												Let me start this review off by adding some possible situational or subjective circumstances that might make me biased in favour of this game.I started playing BEEP shortly after going through over a month of hell of finally beating Fallout: Tactics on Tough Guy mode. (No saves outside of bunkers, no saves during a mission, meaning if you die, you have to travel back to the mission, and completely redo everything just for another swing at the enemy that killed you.)In contrast to my previous slough with Fallout: Tactics (A game which I also recommend, and have done a review on.), BEEP was a refreshing breath of calm gameplay, a very lovely soundtrack, and soft (not particularly difficult) levels.The soundtrack is very relaxing, and the audio that plays when you complete levels is joyful and enjoyable. BEEP, frankly, is also a game I would have no apprehension about showing my niece. That is to say, it wouldn't come out with intolerable explosively violent gameplay, which can serve as a deterrent for some to enter the realm of gaming, it's a good ""first game"", type of game. The noises BEEP The BEEPbot make are also oddly joy inducing. I just couldn't help enjoying its excitement when you collect a piece of antimatter. All in all, the audio for the game is pleasant.The graphics, aren't particularly stunning, and to some extent, are fairly bland. The level designs, planets, and backgrounds are very, very well done. Not absolutely stunning, but they're very creative looking, and easy on the eyes. BEEP itself, is very, VERY, basic. It, he, or she, is a little grey robot with a little cannon-arm-gun-thing, jets, and apparently a hull that can sustain 900m depths (according to BEEP itself). He's nothing to write home about, but she's also not the worst thing in the world. The frames do drop on and off on some levels, the only one I've noticed thus far being the swamp level. Another thing I've noticed is that on occasion, when there's an explosion, black boxes can appear where I assume background tiles are intended to appear, and those can be an eyesore, but luckily, they don't stick around for long, and are usually gone within a few seconds.The gameplay is a basic puzzle-solving, limited action (you occasionally have to blast some robo-baddies, mines, suicide bot-mbers, laser-bullet-bill-shark-hybrids, or the wall to assert your dominance over it), and limited free exploration. In the hub between levels, you get to fly around a spaceship with ""BEEP"" written on it, and I had more fun smashing into the planets or asteroids than I'd care to admit.BEEP also features a very, very neat physics system. BEEP is equipped with a grav-gun, and it's actually quite similar to HL2's grav-gun. Only instead of slicing baddies in half with mach-10 sawblades thrown because you're out of shotgun ammo, you'll be pulling things around, and throwing deceased robobaddies at the wall for fun.BEEP is a good ""winding-down"" type of game, where after doing something stressful, playing as a robot in a colourful world, will calm you down much more than it will work you up. BEEP is very, short, however, at roughly 5 hours of gameplay if you're doing a 100% completion run (which almost happens autonomously). I personally bought BEEP with a coupon I had, for 50 cents. At full price, it's still very much worth it if you're looking for something basic and calm. If you want to rip your hair out at being hatefully demolished by robots, play Fallout: Tactics. If you want to scream at rolling 6 0s in a row, play Europa Universalis IV. If you want to blast robo-sharks and smash a spaceship into planets and asteroids, play BEEP.All in all,  BEEP is basic, not particularly noteworthy, but still enjoyable and has its own unique charm to it.

												Things I liked about the game:---Everything is in plain sight -- there are no hidden rooms.---Ample check points (with the exception of the very last level marathon ).---But most of all, when you die, you keep everything you found. You do not have to do the difficult trick AND survive. This can lead to interesting strategies involving suicide runs. So long as you've reached a checkpoint, you can leave a level mid-stream and still retain the item pickup progress.Some minor bugs I've found:---World 1: Level 4, the Anti-Matter is out of order. You find the ""second"" one in the tracker first, then the ""third"" one, and the last one you find is the ""first"" one in the tracker.---Occasionally your anti-gravity gun doesn't work. The quickest way to fix this is to just die and respawn.---One of the textures is missing. During explosions black boxes appear.---The developers cleverly programmed in an anti-exploit system that deactivates your anti-gravity gun whenever BEEP gains altitude, however this can be worked around. Similar to Minecraft where you can jump and place a brick beneath you -- you can jump and anti-gravity pull something toward you, jump off it, and pull it again. Using the sentry robot's body, for example, you can bring one with you and use it as a mid-air platform to get another jump in to reach high areas without the intended solution.			"

												Well I think I got pretty close to the end but the last ice level is way hard.. If you are a fan of platformers and want something different, I definitely recommend this game. The devs did a great job, and with the sale it was around 2 dollars. The content is pretty high, and the only thing I could find against the mechanics is stacking.. It's not that bad but when you get to the ice levels and you have to stack 4 or 5 ice cubes it can get a bit tedious. Give it a shot if you have a few extra lying around in the dusty wallet, I think its worth it for all skill levels.			"

												This is not a word I use to describe games much, if at all, but the game is very cute. The robot known as a beep, is very much like a WALL-E, and makes appropriate ""cute"" sounds. I actually crack up quite a bit from the sounds it makes, and the art style and music also follows along with the theme.The puzzles aren't too difficult, and the platforming is very forgiving. The jumps are very floatly, with a very generous gliding back down to the ground. Combine that with the anti-gravity gun, and you have some good control over the robot. He even goes up surfaces with it's wheels that you wouldn't think he could climb up.I would say content wise, the game is safe for children, however some puzzles might cause the child to want some adult help. Even still, I think the game is friendly to people of all ages, and I highly recommend the game. I was thinking this was a game I'd only farm trading cards out of, given the extremely low price. Instead, I found a game I intend to play through, and enjoy very much.A surprise, and an enjoyable one at that.			"

												Very beautiful easy platformer.  Even children can play it (thouth last levels somewhat difficult). Especially since story is of exploration and kindness.Something i really want to see in this game - achievments. Would be really great to spend more hours trying to do some ridiculous stuff (make tower of 10 robots and so on).Let's play this game and wait for sequel :)			"

												Pretty good physics platformer. You control a robot on wheels that can shoot enemies and move things around with its gravity gun. The goal is to get to the end of each level while collecting enough pieces of antimatter to unlock the next one. The puzzles are very easy, but stacking blocks (and dead enemies) to get to a high place requires some patience.You have infinitely many robots (lives) and you keep your progress within the level when you die, which is pretty good.The game never gets very hard. Still took me 8 hours and 100 robots though.			"

												At first I truly enjoyed the game but after a bunch of levels, it became mundane. BEEP eventually felt like an unpolished platformer due to its flash-like graphics and exploitable physics. It was also baffling for me that there was no option menu especially for those times when the game glitches in choosing the correct resolution. The ideas were whole but the cohesion of all the elements weren't quite there; it looked complete but slowly fell apart as I progressed through.			"

Getting everything was not very difficult, and I could skip through levels with ease (jump on a mildly large item and use the tractor beam to bring it back up to your wheels and jump again, repeat).  Overall, this game was fun, not very many glitches, and for $0.19 you can't wrong.			"

												After trying BEEP several times, I just could not find it interesting enough to continue.  Its mechanics are unique and add a level of puzzling to its platforming, but the overall experience leaned toward being cumbersome and not particularly enjoyable.  This is in contrast to Mario games from which it draws inspiration, where moving through the world is intrinsically entertaining.  The average graphics and abscence of story give less meaning to the experience.  It's a game I would play if there weren't much better ones, but there are.			"

												+It is purely brilliant+simple but great looking and feeling cartoon style graphics+starts easy but gets very tricky the learning curve is very well done+the controls are a smooth as butter you can land this little robot on a pin with practice and snipe a robot from a ledge 2 screens away with the corpse of another dead robot.+ the physics are great.+music is not memorable but not bad by any means it suits the game well.+ sound effects for the robots are hilarious and satisfying also the sound of the alarms really adds to the stress of dodging bullets whilst trying to destroy them.+ the enemies are really well balanced and are no pushovers by any means combat is great alltogether there is nothing more satifying than smashing one of the spike ball robots to peices with one well aimed rock and there is nothing more stressfull than when you miss and they start throwing back :P+The price omg is this a bargain I have more hours on this than some stuff I paid £10 for- there is no real storyline but it is so much fun and so cheap to play you dont even care- The only bug I saw in this game was when the small exploding robots were destroyed sometimes they left behind quite a large black square where they died, not game breaking at all sometimes they dissapear instantly and they always dissapear if they go offscreen or if beep jumps in front of it.-no bosses if this game had huge bosses at the end of each planet that you had to tear apart it would be absolutley great.If you have some spare change and want an amazing platformer to play, GET THIS GAME it will not dissappoint you, it is also a perfect gift if you have friends on steam with no purchased games to activate thier friend privelages.11 out of 10 been a long long time since I have enjoyed a platformer as much as this will be buying extra copies to send as gifts when I have spare cash.

Not because of how fun it is, but because of how the game ended. The ending suggested a sequel to the game, where we go to the Creeps home planet. The game was released in 2011, and there is no sequel. Big Fat Alien, you get to work with that. For what it is though, it's a pretty fun game, and it's only $2.			"

												For £0.79 or $0.50 this game is very good. The programming is solid yet it bugs very few times but that doesn't matter for this priced game. The graphics are great (a comic-y art style) and the physics gun is better then some other physics guns I've seen on games. Overall the game is well made and for £0.79 or $0.50 its great! I reccomend greatly.			"

												This game was awesome! I played the heck out of it! I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good puzzle game, with an intreging story line. Can the ""K.R.E.E.P.S"" ever be defeated? Will B.E.E.P manage to return to earth? Can Ender stop listing off things to try and get a possible customer interested in Beep?Maybe we will never know... Maybe we can. Buy Beep! Its worth the money!			"

												As much as I'd like to give this game a recommendation, I just can't.I had a blast in the first hour or so of the game, but the fuel mechainc really threw me off as I feel like it made the levels too big and it got easy to miss stuff.The music, while being very fitting, became way too repetative and boring after a while.But the biggest issue I had with this game was a bug that sometimes made the remains of enemies appear as black boxes. It would often make it hard to see the platforms and sometimes result in my death.It's a good thing it's cheap, but I feel like it could be free.4/10			"

												There's something oddly satisfying about flinging dead robots across a screen.BEEP is a simple yet enjoyable platformer that puts your efforts toward solving puzzles using a robot (BEEP) and the game's physics engine. Most of the time these puzzles are fairly easy to figure out as you're primarily just moving rocks and logs around until you've found the correct setup to accomplish your goal, but the odd puzzle might leave you scratching your head on occasion. There are also enemies in the game that take the form of opposing robots, but they're so underwhelming and easy to destroy that they merely serve as a hindrance to your progression. From start to finish, you're probably looking at 5-7 hours worth of gameplay depending on how fast you manage to roll (or fly) through the worlds.This isn't the type of game that's going to leave you awestruck or clamoring for more once you've finished. It is however a game that you can jump straight into and play in a relaxing manner. It's fun, simple and essentially free if you purchase it during a sale. I actually made a profit of nine cents after selling the trading cards.  It's hard to argue against picking up a game when you're basically being paid to play it. Enjoy!			"

												Considering I only paid 19 cents for this game, it's going to stay.TL/DR: BEEP is a OK game, but not worth $5. If you REALLY have to have it, wait for a sale,Graphics: 4/10. Looks/feels rushed, can sometimes be hard to tell what is a wall or not. Each menu looks like a 30 second project. (Or a last-minute thing.)Gameplay: 6/10. Good ideas, but not the most straightforward sometimes. The Gravity Gun would sometimes not latch on properly and disconnect at random. The game itself also assumes that you know what you can or cannot shoot. I had spent about 6 lives trying to pass a set of lasers using a defeated enemy, only to find that I could shoot them. One level in particular drove me nuts with having to build a set of platforms, and then giving you a Rocket system once completed. Needless to say, I somewhat lost hope in it after that.Sound: 4/10 Not really worth writing about, although some of the effects do get annoying rather quickly. Overall: 3/10 At full price. 4/10 discounted. Utter confusion, odd/cheap looking graphics, and an overall rushed feel put down some rather great ideas.			"

												At first i believed this game to be for young kids, well, it is but not in the way I thought it was. First of all this game was extremely cheap, 0.20$ to be exact, (as it was on sale). I opened up the game, found the title screen to be very basic, but hey what do you expect from a 0.20$ game? I played about 20 minutes and got a bit bored, i told my self, 'Hey i could keep it for when my younger cousins come over' and left it for a while. About 1 month later I had litle to do and I thought i might as well try it again. I found that i quite enjoyed the game's simple yet cute art style and decent controls. The most fun i had was actually discovering the different enemies and seeing how they react to my presence (eg.firing lasers or an electric body). I perhaps spent to much time flying/ floating around with the robot's booster and dying because of it but hey, you would to. The most disapointing aspect in my opinion are the puzles, I am quite early into the game but I can't seeing the puzles getting any more complex, they mainly consist of busy work and could be easily completed by a young child, to be fair this game is targeted to that audience so who am i to blame. Overall the game is no AAA title but it is extremely possible to lose yourself in the adorable art style, wacky controls and some interesting game mechanics for many hours. It is sure to be lots of fun for a young child (and even adults). It offers a degree of complexity and simpleness often requiring you to do precise jumps, conserving fuel and timing your movementsAnd with a price like that? you know this is a steal.B-P.S Is it just me or is it just really fun to fling the corpses of fallen enemies across the map? Just me? OK			"

												I SAY THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS GAME ITS HARD AS HELL Now on to my review of BEEP it is a amzing work of gamege but its is like imposable to beat like crazy hard it looks like i kids game but nooooooooooooooooo its not. now for a pie its amazing and trust this random stranger on the internet Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing But i love this game :) "

												Beep is a great game, and definitely lives up to the claims it makes of being like yoshi island with gravity guns.Following a ship of robots [beeps], you aim to travel a solar system and collect anti-matter. The levels are your classic platformer side-scrolling style, but there is a lot of variety in landscapes, from levels that require a jetpack, to those in underground flooded caves. There are also enemies that you can either shoot or avoid. The majority of the gameplay is pretty casual, for example there is no limit on your ammo, you can reload an infinite amount of times. Some of the enemies require a bit of experimenting to find the best way to deal with them, which provides a challenge. That said, most of the enemies have a very simple AI.The gravity gun provides for some very interesting gameplay. You can pick up many objects, including enemies, which can lead to finding some interesting solutions [not always the intended ones] to progressing through levels. This coupled with the gravity reversal in the final zone definitely makes this a great gameplay object, rather than just a gimmick.The art in this game is very nice, and aside from a few [what i suspect are] spritesheet glitches when a certain enemy explodes, it is consistent throughout the game. On top of that, the music in this game is great.This game is also short. The main level selection screen shows you have essentially 6 'zones', each with 4 levels. If you are a veteran player of platformers like this, you will probably breeze through it in no time. Regardless, if you like platformers, you will also enjoy it very much.			"

												I believe beep is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. This game completely changed my life. I was going through some rough times and the 30 minutes I spent on Beep changed my life. This is the best game ever it stopped me from drinking the full 10 ounces of bleach in order to kill myself. The complex and emotional story had me in awe. The bonk engine made this game look like it was real life. The vibrant colors and effects makes this game look on par with games like Battlefield One. If you do not already have this game buy it RIGHT NOW.			"

												This is a very nice little puzzle platformer where the highlight of the game is the Box2D physics engine. The game is one big physics playground. Every world adds a new gameplay element, mostly physics based, that usually isn't used later, so it keeps the challenges and puzzles fresh. Some of the levels are quite big and it is unfortunate there are no secrets to find or achievements. The music is very nice and relaxing, and every world is not just visually unique, but has its own music theme too.One negative about the game are the mouse controls. The cursor doesn't move completely free, but ""sticks"" to certain objects and stuff, so it often feels clumsy. It takes some time to get used to. Other problem is the framerate which is quite unstable and drops below 60 FPS even on a powerful PC. I think I had more stable framerate in Crysis 1 than in this game.The game is not very challenging, just enough to keep your brain busy without the danger to get you stuck or get frustrated. I would highly recommend this for kids, to work on their problem solving and logic skills, or for casual players.			"

												The game is awesome.You could even say this is WALL-E and Mario combined.And,instead of eating other robots OR jumping on their heads you shoot them.Also,the game IS NOT just about running and jumping:it also makes you think. There are MANY puzzles in the game starting off with easy pizy lemon squizzy puzzles but as the game progresses,the puzzles are more challenging. How can you get through those lazers there?(30 minutes later)I could use my anti-gravity gun to lift that robots body to protect myself from them,can I?And also,right now it's only £0.15 because it's on sale!BTW,first review!Hope this will help you!

												so I played this game for 1 hour and I bought it for a 96% discount, so it costed me only 0.20$, my 1st expression when I saw this was like, might as well offer the game for free with this discount :) it`s original price is 5$, I have bought like 6 copies of these to send them as gifts. -gameplay:- the game is pretty easy to play and very fun, but one most be sort of skilled with keyboard and mouse to play the game enjoyably, I don`t think it supports gamepad.-graphics:- its one of the simplest 2d graphics I have seen but it`s crafted well and looks nice and smooth. I really love the simplicity factor but the menu layout could be better. -story and puzzles:- its about a robot ships being sent to out space in the future to discover planets in other galaxies. u simply orbit the planets with ur little rocket ship and hit deploy on various places on the planet to deploy the little cute catty sounded robot. u face plenty of obsacles and the game appears to have many missions, u have to stack stuff, block things and slide things to reach your goal. nothing too complicated but it`s fun and rewarding. conclusion: coming from a hardcore, eye candy fps, strategy and racing gamer, this game may not be as appealing but after I played it I truely loved it. it`s definitly a kid game. but one must always keep the inside kiddo in us alive and happy :) I`m definitly gifting alot of copies to my young cousins since they would love it:) I would say it's even worth 5$ full price and even better with 96% discount.

												BEEP is a nice, simple diddy and I would recommend it - it looks nice, handles well and is just frustrating enough to make you keep playing it (I only ragequitted twice!). The question is - who can I recommend it to?The design, as I mentioned, is nice, but it gives off a kinda ""babby's first platformer"" feel. But then again, I think it might be too hard for the kids who'd appreciate it, and I'm not sure if the ones old enough to figure out the puzzles would want to be seen playing it.Of course, if you're an adult with nothing to prove to anyone, you'll enjoy it yourself.But unless you've got money to burn or really want to support the devs, maybe wait till it's on sale.

												Well I think I got pretty close to the end but the last ice level is way hard.. If you are a fan of platformers and want something different, I definitely recommend this game. The devs did a great job, and with the sale it was around 2 dollars. The content is pretty high, and the only thing I could find against the mechanics is stacking.. It's not that bad but when you get to the ice levels and you have to stack 4 or 5 ice cubes it can get a bit tedious. Give it a shot if you have a few extra lying around in the dusty wallet, I think its worth it for all skill levels.			"

												Beep is a great game, and definitely lives up to the claims it makes of being like yoshi island with gravity guns.Following a ship of robots [beeps], you aim to travel a solar system and collect anti-matter. The levels are your classic platformer side-scrolling style, but there is a lot of variety in landscapes, from levels that require a jetpack, to those in underground flooded caves. There are also enemies that you can either shoot or avoid. The majority of the gameplay is pretty casual, for example there is no limit on your ammo, you can reload an infinite amount of times. Some of the enemies require a bit of experimenting to find the best way to deal with them, which provides a challenge. That said, most of the enemies have a very simple AI.The gravity gun provides for some very interesting gameplay. You can pick up many objects, including enemies, which can lead to finding some interesting solutions [not always the intended ones] to progressing through levels. This coupled with the gravity reversal in the final zone definitely makes this a great gameplay object, rather than just a gimmick.The art in this game is very nice, and aside from a few [what i suspect are] spritesheet glitches when a certain enemy explodes, it is consistent throughout the game.

It would often make it hard to see the platforms and sometimes result in my death.It's a good thing it's cheap, but I feel like it could be free.4/10			"

												Platformers, by and large come in two varieties:  Cute and Cuddly, and mentally difficult.   While things like SuperMeatBoy fall into the latter, this very firmly falls into the former.  Beep is, essentially, a keyboard/mouse physics puzzler/platformer crossover.  You take control of a little robot, exploring a solar system of three planets, 'beaming down' into level after level, looking for 'antimatter', and then beaming back up.The game features all the usual favourites of platformers - you'll be teetering on edges, jumping over enemies, sliding blocks, running on rotating drums, solving machine puzzles, shooting bullets, and my absolute #1 favourite: dying a lot.That's the thing about platformers: They're set up to kill you. Some are fierce and you're expected to die every 10 seconds, while others involve tactics, long run-ups, and really spectacular jumps (e.g. Sonic).  This falls midway between the two: It never presents a level which is ridiculously hard, usually giving you a relatively safe place you can 'fall' to, but although there are some really nice long jumps, and great swings, it doesn't have the majesty of AAA platformers like Sonic.This feels like an indie Flash game that outgrew the technology and needed to visit the big leagues.  It's cute, cuddly, easy to pick up, has good music, fun sound effects, and is nicely balanced.  There were very few occasions where I got truly narked with the level design, but generally, I found a better way to do it than I had been trying.The game rewards mild exploration.  Unlike some games that cheat with invisible doors, off-screen specials, or collapsing platforms, this game is pretty straight-up, and says ""There's a special up here.  Come get it if you can work out how."".  I finished the game collecting every single last piece of antimatter, and didn't spend ages banging my fists in frustration either.So, yeah, this is a really really fun little game.  I don't recommend playing on a touchpad. It REALLY benefits from a mouse.  Similarly, if your mouse skills aren't great, I'd pass on this, cos you have to be a bit good on the point-and-click.  For the price, this gave a lot of entertainment, although not a lot of story per se.  The game hints to a sequel, which I'd consider playing if the price was as low as I got this one for.  Pick it up if you have a few hours to kill: Each level takes about 10 to 30 minutes to master and complete, so you can play it in short bursts.Great fun.			"

												I wanted to like Beep.  The music and art style is charming and some of the level design is good, but the difficulty is very uneven.  Worse, the difficulty arises not from a solution being hard to think of, but because the controls are too loose to precisely perform what you've thought of.Tighter controls would have turned this game from a no to a yes.

The gameplay has a lot of variety and the pace is quite casual. You can play it at your own pace (except the last level which is going to suck as much as Captain Claw did).			"

Most of the time these puzzles are fairly easy to figure out as you're primarily just moving rocks and logs around until you've found the correct setup to accomplish your goal, but the odd puzzle might leave you scratching your head on occasion. There are also enemies in the game that take the form of opposing robots, but they're so underwhelming and easy to destroy that they merely serve as a hindrance to your progression. From start to finish, you're probably looking at 5-7 hours worth of gameplay depending on how fast you manage to roll (or fly) through the worlds.This isn't the type of game that's going to leave you awestruck or clamoring for more once you've finished. It is however a game that you can jump straight into and play in a relaxing manner. It's fun, simple and essentially free if you purchase it during a sale. I actually made a profit of nine cents after selling the trading cards.  It's hard to argue against picking up a game when you're basically being paid to play it. Enjoy!			"

												Although cast with a whimsical, simple style of gameplay, and a Wall-E sense of innocence, Beep just doesn't offer anything beyond the basic experience. Your goal is basically to collect matter, and it doesn't get much more complex. You platform around like your average Mario game if you were wearing roller scates, you do basic physics puzzles, and collect the game's equivalent to coins.  I found it a tad on the easy side, and graphically it looks like something that came out of Newgrounds, which would be okay if it had substance. If there's any reason I played this for longer than 5 minutes, it was to get the cards. Steer clear.			"

												This game is a fun little platformer with some easy and simple puzzles, sometimes giving you that 'aha!' moment. The gravity gun is a pretty clever mechanic, since almost anything can be picked up and thrown at your enemies. I had fun playing this, though if you do buy it, you should get the Developer Alliance Bundle while it's on sale so you can get a bunch of cool games for under 2 dollars.			"

												Great little game with brilliant color and runs so smooth on mid-end PCs. Fun to play and smart use of abilities in the objects found in the environment; a bit of simple tweaking can be done to get you over a seemingly unscalable wall just by using the bodies of defeated robots and the random mass blocks that work even better, especially if you remember to throw them ahead of the screen to use again for the next obstacle.

												It's an enjoyable little platformer with some very inventive puzzles. The art design is cool, and subtle touches (like the gravity featues on the map screen) give the game a refined feel. There are a few glitches and problems here and there, but they're nothing too major, especially considering I could keep retrying difficult sections over and over again from the same checkpoint for as long as I wanted.It's fun, with a bit of challenge and variety as the game progresses.

												Pretty good physics platformer. You control a robot on wheels that can shoot enemies and move things around with its gravity gun. The goal is to get to the end of each level while collecting enough pieces of antimatter to unlock the next one. The puzzles are very easy, but stacking blocks (and dead enemies) to get to a high place requires some patience.You have infinitely many robots (lives) and you keep your progress within the level when you die, which is pretty good.The game never gets very hard. Still took me 8 hours and 100 robots though.			"

												Platformers, by and large come in two varieties:  Cute and Cuddly, and mentally difficult.   While things like SuperMeatBoy fall into the latter, this very firmly falls into the former.  Beep is, essentially, a keyboard/mouse physics puzzler/platformer crossover.  You take control of a little robot, exploring a solar system of three planets, 'beaming down' into level after level, looking for 'antimatter', and then beaming back up.The game features all the usual favourites of platformers - you'll be teetering on edges, jumping over enemies, sliding blocks, running on rotating drums, solving machine puzzles, shooting bullets, and my absolute #1 favourite: dying a lot.That's the thing about platformers: They're set up to kill you. Some are fierce and you're expected to die every 10 seconds, while others involve tactics, long run-ups, and really spectacular jumps (e.g. Sonic).  This falls midway between the two: It never presents a level which is ridiculously hard, usually giving you a relatively safe place you can 'fall' to, but although there are some really nice long jumps, and great swings, it doesn't have the majesty of AAA platformers like Sonic.This feels like an indie Flash game that outgrew the technology and needed to visit the big leagues.  It's cute, cuddly, easy to pick up, has good music, fun sound effects, and is nicely balanced.  There were very few occasions where I got truly narked with the level design, but generally, I found a better way to do it than I had been trying.The game rewards mild exploration.  Unlike some games that cheat with invisible doors, off-screen specials, or collapsing platforms, this game is pretty straight-up, and says ""There's a special up here.  Come get it if you can work out how."".  I finished the game collecting every single last piece of antimatter, and didn't spend ages banging my fists in frustration either.So, yeah, this is a really really fun little game.  I don't recommend playing on a touchpad. It REALLY benefits from a mouse.  Similarly, if your mouse skills aren't great, I'd pass on this, cos you have to be a bit good on the point-and-click.  For the price, this gave a lot of entertainment, although not a lot of story per se.  The game hints to a sequel, which I'd consider playing if the price was as low as I got this one for.  Pick it up if you have a few hours to kill: Each level takes about 10 to 30 minutes to master and complete, so you can play it in short bursts.Great fun.			"

												I'll start by saing BEEP is probably worth $2.  My negative recommendation is not based on the monetary cost.  I wouldn't recommend BEEP simply because I don't think it's worth the time you would put into it.  Pretty much every part of BEEP can be considered ""just good enough,"" but the game lacks polish in all departments.  The graphics aren't bad enough to be offensive, but don't really bring anything to the table.  The controls are adequate, but it's pretty obvious no effort was made to tighten them up or make them any better once an acceptable implementation was found.  The level design adequately makes the player use the game mechanics in the way they were intended to be use, but it seems like no one went and made the small adjustments to improve the gameplay ever so slightly.  Overall, it's just okay, and personally I don't think it's worth the time or effort.			"

												A fun and difficult platformer, I'd definately recomment this! Of course, sometimes using the enemies as platforms is sometimes frustrating. My only real gripe is that there is no sequel. Not because of how fun it is, but because of how the game ended. The ending suggested a sequel to the game, where we go to the Creeps home planet. The game was released in 2011, and there is no sequel. Big Fat Alien, you get to work with that. For what it is though, it's a pretty fun game, and it's only $2.			"

												BEEP is a simple platformer. At a glance, this looks like a run-of-the-mill Mario or Sonic knockoff. However, BEEP is an entirely different type of platformer than others. I personally despise the genre, but I picked up the title for $0.19 regardless. I thought I'd try it for a couple minutes, hate it, and return it. However, I was laughing hard for a good hour. BEEP is extremely fun, the jet-propulsion is an amazing concept to introduce to a platformer. One of the best parts about this game is the gravity gun. You can swing enemies back in forth hilariously with it. The best part about this small game is the soundtrack. The music this game is set to is soothing and intriguing. And the sound effects are ever great. Typical robot sound effects sound annoying, but BEEP's sounds are simple and not too high pitched. This makes the game so inviting. I wouldn't buy this game at $5, because it goes on sale for $0.19 so often. The game takes a few days to complete even if you play diligently, so it's not like you play it for an hour or so and the game is complete. If you have a dollar in your Steam account, there's no reason to pick this title up when it's on sale.			"

												The game crashes instantly with no error messages or anything. Nobody knows how to fix it and Big Fat Alien are apparently no help whatsoever. Some people are saying it's to do with the Xonar Sound Card and they've fixed it by disabling GX. Others say they've fixed it by unplugging their Logitech G35 headset...

												BEEP is a fun game including simple and more advanced puzzles, a cute story, cute world, cute characters, cute cute cute etc.. The price is also very nice (1$ or so); everyone can afford it. Depending on your skill, the game will take aprox. 3-4 hours to complete. There are 3 planets, with 2 worlds on each planet. Individually, there are 4 levels on each world. That's a total of 24 levels, with 6 different worlds (backgrounds). The music is quite nice, never being distracting unless you spend way too much time ♥♥♥♥ing around in one level. I wish there were more enemies and variety of weapons and puzzles.However, you should beware of some things within the game. For example, the game can't be played in full screen mode nor can the buttons be switched. The first issue can be fixed simply by pressing Alt+Enter to make it windowed mode. Another thing is an annoying bug on lava level 4 (last level). On the second checkpoint, there's a chance that the game will instantly crash on impact. This is kind of tricky to get past. The way I did it was to kill the robot previous to that area, and carry him to the second platform from the laser beam. From there, jump on the robot, pull the robot towards you and jump again so you get high enough to jump over it and past that checkpoint. There is also a chance the game with crash if you're hit by any other laser beams on the same level.Other than this, it's really worth the money. It's fun and mostly relaxing (unless you struggle or get stuck somewhere).Final rating: 7.5/10  "

												Really simple little platformer with some easy shooting and physics puzzles (you can move blocks around, opening paths that were blocked or out of reach).  Controls well and generally feels fun to play.One negative is that the visuals aren't always completely clear.  Sometimes it's not obvious whether or not something is ground you can stand on or just the background.I got this game for just a couple cents on sale (the trading cards sold for about as much as the game cost) and have been pleasantly surprised.

												I purchased this game for about 14 cents, and while I did satisfy my curiousity, this game really began to grate me only half way through my first hour.The concept is charming enough, and the whole project just oozes cuteness, with the sounds that asteroids make when you bumb into them to the little phrases your robots utter when they do something notible or die. Infinite lives and fairly placed checkpoints were quite welcome, While it does have the atmosphere of a first time game, and while it came out a few years ago, it's a surprisingly competant one, especially given what Steam is saturated with nowadays, although the flash game aesthetic doesn't help.That being said, the floaty controls and precise platforming required do not make for a good time, although it doesn't start that way. Describing itself as a hardcore platformer to me indicates the controls and mechanics will be fine and precise, yet like the fleshed out flashgame it is, you won't find that here.Following basic platformer rules, BEEP introduces new mechanics every few levels or so, and getting the super hard to reach goodies even early on demand a mastery of them. However, you're little robot friend is quickly tasked with some fairly convoluted puzzles, implementing a poor man's gravity gun that doesn't work half the time, and when it does, it controls like dead animal caught in a wind turbine. Some enemies, which you can also use the g-gun on once killed, have parts that you can't hook onto, effectively turning off your beam and having you drop it. Repeatedly. This wouldn't be so bad  if there weren't areas that called for the use of these enemies, or the requirement to be precise with the positioning as you're forced to move quickly instead of methodically, but of course I wouldn't be complaining otherwise. It doesn't help that the gravity implemented is a pain in butt, and although you're little robot has a jetpack in which it can launch itself in the air and decent traction when it lands on an edge, you can't use it to stabilize or adjust mid jump, leading to some frustration on already floaty controls that are mired by the fact that majority of the game is just bland chasms with chunks of platforms spread far out of eyesight.It doesn't help that there is a function to fly, but it's purely locational, and only works when you find a pad that lets you charge it. Nevermind the fact that you can't use any remaining jump fuel to adjust, the fact it isn't a permanent upgrade, and something you have to constantly go back and recharge until you know exactly where you're going isn't my idea of fun. Implementing a metroid style progression system wouldn't be hard, and because I constantly felt underprepared no matter what level I went into left me more frustrated than anything. Combat is especially weak, and while your shield isn't awful, your gun is extremely weak. This being said, I barely managed to finish the second to last level of the first world out of sheer will before throwing in the towel, so if there are any permanent upgrades, I didn't find them. That isn't an excuse more so than it is to say that even the base game isn't great to play, and there is no driving incentive outside of seeing the next area, which is basically just a pallet swap of the last in one way or another.BEEP is not a bad game by any means, but it's not one I can reccomend. Still, since it was put on sale because of the studio about to announce a new game. I truly wish them all the luck, and for the small amount of pennies that they ask for on sale, it's worth it just for the trading cards. Regardless of how I feel about this game, it's without a doubt better than 90% of the other crap being dumped onto steam, so hopefully they've improved over the last few years.			"

												Considering I only paid 19 cents for this game, it's going to stay.TL/DR: BEEP is a OK game, but not worth $5. If you REALLY have to have it, wait for a sale,Graphics: 4/10. Looks/feels rushed, can sometimes be hard to tell what is a wall or not. Each menu looks like a 30 second project. (Or a last-minute thing.)Gameplay: 6/10. Good ideas, but not the most straightforward sometimes. The Gravity Gun would sometimes not latch on properly and disconnect at random. The game itself also assumes that you know what you can or cannot shoot. I had spent about 6 lives trying to pass a set of lasers using a defeated enemy, only to find that I could shoot them. One level in particular drove me nuts with having to build a set of platforms, and then giving you a Rocket system once completed. Needless to say, I somewhat lost hope in it after that.Sound: 4/10 Not really worth writing about, although some of the effects do get annoying rather quickly. Overall: 3/10 At full price. 4/10 discounted. Utter confusion, odd/cheap looking graphics, and an overall rushed feel put down some rather great ideas.			"

It can also get a bit tricky at times, especially at the end, but for the most part it just feels too easy.What I really don't like, is the lack of options in the main menu. There is also no way to rebind your controls or change resolution, but overall it is still a good game.			"

												This is by far one of the most value packed games I have played. For such a small price why not just grab it and try it?It was gifted to me by a viewer and so I thought I'd give it a try and I was impressed. For an indie game there are some challenging puzzles, hours of playtime(~10 if 100% completion) and tons of infuriating moments. I can only hope that with the sale that recently featured the game that the developer will make a sequel.			"

												Awesome platformer! You can jump, shoot at enemies and throw stuff (including the remains of the robots you destroy) at the baddies! I found it tough to move around with the keyboard and shoot and drag items with the mouse, but after you ge used, it's really good. I recommend this game to any platform fan!================Incrível jogo de plataforma! Você pode pular, atirar os inimigos e segurar e jogar várias coisas no mapa (incluindo os destroços dos robôs que vc destrói) e nos inimigos! Foi duro, no começo, se mover com o teclado e atirar e segurar s objetos com o mouse, mas depois que vc se acostuma, fica show. Eu recomendo este jogo para qualquer fã de jogos de plataforma! :D			"

												I wanted to like Beep.  The music and art style is charming and some of the level design is good, but the difficulty is very uneven.  Worse, the difficulty arises not from a solution being hard to think of, but because the controls are too loose to precisely perform what you've thought of.Tighter controls would have turned this game from a no to a yes.

												BEEP is a pretty decent game. It's cheap and has a good soundtrack. But the thing I like the most is how cute it all seems. I found myself giggling like a little school girl for a good 30 minutes. Yeh. However, it's one of those games you get, play for a couple hours, maybe finish, and never touch it again. Overall, it's good for two dollars (or 50 cents or under on sale), but it does get kind of boring. If you're looking for something cute however, this game is something to check out.			"

												What a bloody mad brilliant genius was the man ... nay, for 'twas no mere man who conceived BEEP.  What a smashing piece of work is BEEP. I don't go in much for platformers since they tend to be MASOCHISTICALLY DIFFICULT in the tradition of say, Super Meat Boy, and who has time for that? BEEP is a kinder gentler, machine, but still will make you work for every inch of progress, the way a good game should. It's also not burdened by the sombre gothic tone of so many games in the genre, think Limbo, or whatnot. It doesn't take itself too seriously but still there were a few nuggets of wisdom. ""Incentive is the mother of inspiration"". I'm paraphrasing. Badly. For a platformer BEEP is also not as linear as some, since there is usually more than one way to tackle a puzzle, and more than one path you can take. It's more of an open concept world, but not so big as to be unmanageable in a lunch break. You could pick away at BEEP one deployment at a time in the precious few spare moments that busy modern life grudgingly flicks your way. A  PARENT of TWINS could even play this game. That's saying a thing.The only thing I would change, if I were the game designer, heaven forfend, is to remove the 'continue/ship/quit' menu when you lose a BEEP but rather just drop another one immediately at the save point. After all if the player doesn't want to continue, they can just pause to hit the menu and scarper like the cowards they are, no need to interrupt the flow, and BEEP has amazing flow, so that's a minor quibble.It's now just a buck. There are so many worse ways to spend a buck. Well actually not that many since nothing costs a dollar anymore. This makes BEEP the best deal in the world.  That's math, people.We await the SEQUEL. BEEP2 : The EnBEEPening. "

												Well I think I got pretty close to the end but the last ice level is way hard.. If you are a fan of platformers and want something different, I definitely recommend this game. The devs did a great job, and with the sale it was around 2 dollars. The content is pretty high, and the only thing I could find against the mechanics is stacking.. It's not that bad but when you get to the ice levels and you have to stack 4 or 5 ice cubes it can get a bit tedious. Give it a shot if you have a few extra lying around in the dusty wallet, I think its worth it for all skill levels.			"

												At first I truly enjoyed the game but after a bunch of levels, it became mundane. BEEP eventually felt like an unpolished platformer due to its flash-like graphics and exploitable physics. It was also baffling for me that there was no option menu especially for those times when the game glitches in choosing the correct resolution. The ideas were whole but the cohesion of all the elements weren't quite there; it looked complete but slowly fell apart as I progressed through.			"

												This is not a word I use to describe games much, if at all, but the game is very cute. The robot known as a beep, is very much like a WALL-E, and makes appropriate ""cute"" sounds. I actually crack up quite a bit from the sounds it makes, and the art style and music also follows along with the theme.The puzzles aren't too difficult, and the platforming is very forgiving. The jumps are very floatly, with a very generous gliding back down to the ground. Combine that with the anti-gravity gun, and you have some good control over the robot. He even goes up surfaces with it's wheels that you wouldn't think he could climb up.I would say content wise, the game is safe for children, however some puzzles might cause the child to want some adult help. Even still, I think the game is friendly to people of all ages, and I highly recommend the game. I was thinking this was a game I'd only farm trading cards out of, given the extremely low price. Instead, I found a game I intend to play through, and enjoy very much.A surprise, and an enjoyable one at that.			"

												I was not gifted this game by anyone, it came in a bundle with a game I wanted and was cheaper than just the other game.At the price I think it's worth it.It's glitchy, the sound effects grate and the music randomly cuts out at times.I don't regret playing it but I doubt I'll ever open it again.Has the feel of a 00's newgrounds flash game, by no means a bad thing but gaming has moved on since then.Saved by a few well designed levels but otherwise baffling to see it's rated ""very positive""2/10, it doesnt hurt to get it free but don't buy it			"

												What is BEEP? BEEP is an amazing  physics-platformer  where you are like a little robot (BEEP) and you need to complete all 24 levels. Pros +Good price+Interesting mechanics+Not too hard, so you won't rage and you can enjoy the game Cons -Short Overall I enjoyed playing this game but it could have been a little longer. I rate BEEP  7/10 .			"

												A simpel platform game that can deliver a lot of fun. Don't exspect an epic story of some sort, the story is simpel but entertaining. The real fun is being a tiny doom bot that looks cute, can fire giant canon balls and has an gravity gun with which you van throw your enemy's across the map.its definetly worth 0.19 cents, hej i would even pay the full price for this. the only bad thing i have to say is that full screen mode doesn't work so well. But you can solf that by using alt + enter en elarging the screen to the size you see fit.so in shorts, buy this !			"

												Usually, I try to finish a game before I review it because it might add new features and gameplay elements or because I want to see the story. However, this game had none of that. Beep is a 2d puzzle platformer where you control a little robot which has the power to shoot bullets, ability to ""fly"" with fuel, and move objects around with what is basically a gravity gun. This game has no story. There is a little blurb at the beginning about you being dropped off to visit various planets but it doesn't come up during gameplay. The game is dull. The levels feel repetitive  to the point where I just want to get to the ending. That wouldn't be a problem except... You have to find 3 'stars' on each level. It doesn't say it outright but mathwise, you have to. The first world has 8 levels with 3 stars each. The next world needs 24 stars to unlock (for some reason). You can technically get an extra star on every level by collecting all the mini stars but they are a pain to find because there are so many of them The music is just not good. I was going to play to the end just to get through the puzzles but the game is just way too boring to let any of that happen. Additionally, It put up arbitrary walls in front of me which just annoyed me until I stopped. You might like it but I did not.			"

												BEEP is an addictive platformer that I originally purchased with some crazy 90% off coupon so it only cost me around $0.49 but it was worth every penny. Every level is a different puzzle in itself if you're going for 100% completion. The levels can be beat super easily if you run through the level not trying to collect anything but where is the fun in that? It's alot of fun and definitely worth more than the $0.49 I was able to pay for it. The only con that I can think of is that it doesnt support the headset that I own (Logitec G35) so I have to play it through my speakers. If the game is started with my headset plugged in, it crashes instantly.			"

												TL;DR: This game is worth every penny, ignoring the bundle price and the trading cards.Well, BEEP may look simple, it is VERY CHALLENGING in the later levels. The concept is simple, and so are the controls. There are tips here and there so you won't be wondering what the hell you are supposed to do. Though, in some part of the game, you can take the unconventional (and easy) way to collect those anti-matter nuggets.The game has amazing physics, even with unusually shaped objects. The combat system (morea accurately, aiming system) is also simple. Your crosshair locks onto targets and you can shoot like a pro while you jump here and there. There's that infinite ammo thing (you have to reload though, either by right clicking on your robot or by pressing ""R"") so you don't have to worry about missing a shot. You have an antigravity beam which allows you to move objects (even enemy corpses) and you will feel the incredible physics this game is offering. You robot's wheels have a good grip and you won't slip off edges easily.Now coming to the graphics and music. Everything is cartoon-ish, and the music is electronic blip blop type. I personally like both of them but many people hate these type of things. It's upto one's own aesthetics.The game interface is simple. TOO SIMPLE. You don't get to tweak any type of settings. You can't change the volume, you can't modify your save files and so on. This is basically the only side of the game that I hate.The game has trading cards, adding badges, backgrounds and emoticons, adding another layer of variety.Overall, this is a solid game.			"

												Bear in mind I've only played a specifically short time. But having played a couple levels I feel as though I've seen the very basics of what the game has to offer.If you're into silly platformers or you have kids that are into silly platformers, BEEP is worth checking out. Definitely a childish art style for a game that still holds enough challenge to have the ability to hold an adult's interest. It's very light and goofy, unlike almost every other game I enjoy. If you want to skip your gore for a night, BEEP is a great choice. Being 1.99, you can expect to get about two dollars of enjoyment from it. It's the same price as going to the dollar store and getting a soda and a bag of chips. But I tend to finish my food rather quickly and finish games rather slowly, so beep will definitely be enjoyable long after my snacks are gone. If you REALLY want a cheeseburger right away, BEEP can wait. But if you happen to have a couple bucks to spend and nothing else sparks your interest, you might want to pick it up and give it a try.

												This game is one of the best indie games I have played yet. This game combines some of the best aspects of 90s platformers with Half-life 2, creating a unique combunation that works. This game you can tell was made for PC, in fact I can't see this working on console because it requires the mouse to be used a lot in a fasion that would not fit console. It also has a cute, relaxing presentation and it has some clever physics puzzles, that is very reminicent of Half-life, but on a 2D plane which makes for some unique situations. The platforming is prety floaty, which some people may love or hate, but I think it fits the game's style perfectly. Overall, this game is defently worth the dollar, or $0.25 I got it for. Overall rating 9.1/10			"

												Nice simple platformer with decent amount of strategy needed.It can be very nice to spend a bit of time, but does get kind of boring.			"

												Beep was great; straight to the point, challenging, exactly as advertised, and far from pricey! If you liked yoshi’s island, or similar platformers, you’ll likely love this. The graphics aren’t very eye grabbing but the game designers more than makes up for it with great level designs, easy to learn/hard to master controls and really well executed puzzle concepts.In all honesty Beep is a boon to it’s genre; if all platformers where like this the genre would probably be immensely more popular. At first all the game elements might seem complex (the gun, the gravity gun, the Beep controls, etc) but they all come together so perfectly and are so intuitive that they actually feel simple and easy to manage. When you play Beep you can really feel that platformers are the game designers bread and butter; Big Fat Alien know what they’re doing. "

												I bought Beep because it was only $0.25, and then I bought a copy for a friend, and now here I am having bought roughly 7 copies of this very fun game for only $1.75. Overall it is a fun game with a soundtrack that is worth a listen to at least.			"

BEEPIt is a simple game that uses logic and physics very simply, this game is just to pass the time or win low value cards. "

												I don't think this is a bad game, so take this with a grain of salt, it's just that I expect a little more from the games I play. This couldn't really motivate me to continue playing.			"
