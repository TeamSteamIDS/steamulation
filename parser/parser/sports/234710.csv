												I own this on both PS3 and PC and there's nothing much to say aside from that this is a brilliant Poker game with tasteful humour, solid dialogue and a great cast.Main Cast: Sam. (Sam & Max)Max. (Sam & Max)Brock Samson. (The Venture Bros.)Ash Williams. (Army of Darkness)Claptrap. (Borderlands)GLaDOS. (Portal)Reginald Van Winslow. (Tales of Monkey Island)Cameos:Steve the Bandit. (Borderlands)Mad Moxxi. (Borderlands)Doug. (The Walking Dead)Save-Lot Bandit. (The Walking Dead)Waiter. (Gravity Bone.)The Good:- Humour is great. - Voice acting is top notch.- Colourful cast of characters.- Well worth the price of £3.99.- Excellent replayability value.- Unlockable items in both Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.The Bad:- Optimization isn't great. - Some annoying glitches. Such as; achievements not unlocking and items not unlocking properly.- Animation bugs.- Audio bugs.Final Verdict:8.8/10I hope you found this review helpful!			"

												Pros:- Comedy has improved a lot- Gameplay is great- More and better choices of chips, decks, and tables- Great lineup of characters including GLaDOS, Brock Samson, and Sam- Pretty good unlockables for Borderlands 2 and TF2- Very fun and great for killing time (great replay ability)- OMAHA HOLD 'EM IS AN OPTION- The action has increased a bit- Great conversations- Some other pros I forgot aboutCons:- Claptrap's ADHD- Ash's constant bluffing- A tiny bit of bugs that rarely happen9/10. Not perfect, but I definitely recommend this to anyone who knows how to play poker.			"

												Poker Night 2 is a Poker game made by Telltale Games. It is available for €5 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night 2 allows you to play Texas Hold'em and Omaha with Sam, Brock, Claptrap and Ash. And to hear the sarcastic lines of science fiction's deadliest A.I., GLaDOS.So what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. While you are playing, you can complete quests to unlock Bounties. If you complete all four tasks, one of the characters will use an item to play. If you manage to beat that character you'll get a TF2 and Borderlands 2 item.Furthermore you'll earn chips that you can use to unlock special tables, decks and chips. The Inventory, the casino, will get a different appeance if you use a table, deck and chips of the same theme.I won't explain the rules of Omaha and Texas Hold'em, but i can tell you that this game is really awesome. While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!Verdict--------This game offers a lot of fun for just €5. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!This game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want to get all decks, cards, tables and unlockable items, you will be staying at the Inventory for 50 hours.Score: 81/100			"

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game as a great way to relax after a long day of work/school.For the most part, the characters around the table are fun and have lots of personality.  If you know their history, its nice to see these licensed characters play poker the way one might imagine.  But even if you've never heard of most of them, you'll come to know them - and their interesting quirks - in short order.Sam is conservative with his betting, almost achingly so.  Ash is just as keen on bluffing as he is on raising the stakes - he *wants* the player to squirm.  Brock comes across as more studious with his bets, but won't hesitate to bet big when he feels he has the advantage; it is fun to just *watch* Brock think.  Claptrap is a wild card, and he knows it; he is fairly easy to intimidate and he seems eager to win the approval of his competitors.  His failures - and constant excuses - will make anyone familar with Borderlands want to hug him....and then hit him in the face.What makes the game particularly fun is that the characters seem to actually enjoy each other's company.  The lines are well read and the timing of their usage accurately reflects the events of the match.  GLaDOS is a perfect addition as supervisor for the evening's events - just as much as the other characters seem to like hanging out together, GLaDOS seems just as eager to be rid of them.  The dynamic works extremely well in keeping the match engaging.As for the poker itself, its pretty conventional stuff; no doubt you've played similar games with similar mechanics before.  But the matches move right along at a good pace, and the ""Showdowns"" are enjoyably tense.  These moments also have the funniest lines, in my opinion.  (...Brock...poor Brock...)In sum, Poker Night 2 is a presentation 'tour de force' with very competent game mechanics.  If you like card games, its not one to be missed.  Oh, and the price is great, too!			"

												I really enjoyed these fantasy charactars talking about their adventures and making whole poker game feel more alive. Poker system is good, it's classic poker and you can play Texas Hold'em or Omaha style., but ifyou just want to play poker this game is not for you, it's frequently interrupted by chatting of other players and you can't do nothing but wait till they finish. So I recommend this game just in purpose to enjoy the scene and atmosphere. Stories and statements are quiet repetitive, but what would you expect, when you are playing 156th game of Poker, just to make your account balance not be in red numbers.Kinda funny and interesting.6/10			"

												A virtual poker game from the Telltale studio, with four characters from different titles, mingled together for your pleasure. And it gives you some items for Team Fortress AND Borderlands 2! Other good thing is what it is a relatively fast full-complete game, where you can get some basic poker skills, if you wasn't familiar with all that poker stuff before.Surprisingly, it is a second game! So I can't be helped but to compare it with the first chapter. Though before I'll drown in the collation, I'll give you some general info.As a virtual poker player simulator, this particular game have many flaws. You have to listen an idle talk of some weird NPC characters, and the most of that talking is amusing at best, and, the worst, it gets repetitive quite fast. To succeed in the game, you need to complete some ""goals"", which can be easily seen as dumb moves. Like struggling for the showdown with only the kicker card, without any combinations... So, eventually, you'll make that goal, but how many times you'll fail miserably in the process? Only Fortune knows.In short, Poker Night 2 almost non-recommended for normal poker game. If only you're not absolutely green in it, so you need a simplistic stuff for getting started.Now, to comparison with the first game:Like Brock (one of the characters there) saying: I guess it's one of those ""take the good with bad"" things...1) Characters. They are much less attractive than in the first game. Less talks (less lines, and especially good lines for every character), less of this ""friendly"" atmosphere, which was created by the predecessor. While I'm usually a big fan of Ash Williams from Evil Dead franchise, I really have to say that it was his worst appearance in the video games (and I've seen them all). Other opponents are also of almost no fun. Brock and Sam have maybe two or three funny lines each, and even Claptrap isn't that shiny thing to save the day.Worst of all, while trying to make them all a better players, Telltale wiseguys do not give them personal characteristics, behavioral patterns, which was a catchy feature of the first game.2) While failed miserably with characters, Telltale has improved other aspects of the game, like: fixed stability issues, added more skins to background, and more little features like ability to order some drinks to your partners, to weaken them... There are much more various music now, visual part is a way updated from the first game.That's more, there you can play not only in the basic Texas Hold'em, but in the Omaha variant of poker as well. Which is good for your poker skill and flexibility of your mind.3) So far it sounds like ""less talk, more action"" stuff, which may be good, if you Just Want to Play a Poker... But alas! For some evil reason they cutted the ability to skip all those fuzzy repetative talks. So, when Claptrap is looping and freezing in the first time, it is fun, sure. But after you hear him 10-20 times, you obviously will be wanting to skip that *beep*. No such luck.I summarize:It is not very good poker game, besides the fact it is easy to adapt and there are an Omaha variant as a plus to the classic hold'em. Play it, if you are getting the items for Tea Fortress or Borderlands 2, or collecting acheievements on gold. But if you are looking for an atmospheric and fun poker game, I suggest to play the first Poker Night game instead. It is better.My mark is 6.2/10.			"

												Rusty Venture used to sell faulty products to S-mart and apparently had a working relationship with Aperture founder Cave Johnson until his disappearance in the 1980s. That seemingly baffling sentence is a good test for gauging how likely you are to enjoy Poker Night 2. If you have no clue what I'm talking about, then it might be best to mosey on. However, if you recognize the references above and laugh at the very thought, then have a seat at the table.Like the original, your enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend greatly on how well acquainted you are with the different franchises showing up. The group is a little more eclectic this time around, pulling names from television and film as well as video games. You're now playing cards with Brock Samson, the kill-crazy bodyguard from Adult Swim's Venture Brothers, Claptrap the robot from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams, the cursed warrior from the Evil Dead film series, and Sam, Max's long-suffering talking dog detective partner. To top it off, GLaDOS from the Portal series has dropped in to act as dealer. There's at least as much dialogue as the first game had, and conceivably much more. Themed games (available once the player has unlocked a deck, chips, and table from the same franchise and activated them all at once) include exclusive conversations you wouldn't hear otherwise, and GLaDOS will often interrupt the players to ask if they could hurry up so she could get back to observing her tests. This is a far more volatile group than the original lineup. Brock has a temper that is always threatening to surface (especially when he loses a hand), while Claptrap and GLaDOS both make several remarks about killing humans. Ash seems rather calm, almost dazed, but he's just happy to be away from deadites for a couple hours. And Sam is the most level-headed of the group, even though Max is sitting in the booth behind him trying to throw him off his game.Poker Night 2 has loads of additional content, including a new game mode (Omaha Poker), unlockable decks, chips, and tables for each character that offer new dialogue and a complete redesign of the Inventory (the Sam and Max 25th anniversary set is my personal favorite), and 5 bounty items to collect, one from each player and GLaDOS. The unlocks are gained by spending Inventory tokens earned while playing, while the multitude of unlocks for both Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 get handed out when the player wins another player's bounty item. Unlike the first game, bounty items are not put up randomly, but made available when certain challenges are met in-game. Another change to the bounty mechanic has the item won once the player simply wins the tournament, rather than having to knock out the character who put it up. Cameos and in-jokes abound, some of them pretty freaking obscure. It's a treasure hunt for detail lovers.As before, there is the chance of dialogue repeating. Unfortunately, Telltale did not include a skip option this time around, for no discernible reason. Another letdown is the fact that Ash sounds nothing like himself. Nothing against the actor who voiced him, but why not try harder to get Bruce Campbell? It would've really added to the experience, especially when all the other characters are faithfully recreated down to the original voiceover. Still, this is a dirt cheap title with a fun premise and solid execution, and I for one would like to see it continue. I've even had fun just speculating with other fans online about who should be included in the next installment. If you're a fan of any of the properties that Poker Night 2 has brought together, or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about, you won't regret the purchase. Telltale Games has added more unlocks, more characters, and more dialogue, all for the same price. It's hard to beat such a deal.			"

When you choose a full set of unlockables you've got the themed place with some funny animation after someone's knocked out.+ More characters. The GLaDOS as a dealer is a pure win. Max is still there with even more craziness.+ Percentage of a win possibilities during all-in deal.+ Much more to-the-point achievements. It can take ages to get straight-flush in the Poker Night at The Inventory.+ (Debatable) Much more challenging partners.+ Game lags much less on slow PCs.+ The game process is more fast-paced. "

IntroHey buddy whats up! Seems you got money on you grab a set and relax lets just play some nice friendly games with big watts of cash.What is really good about this game is not the poker itself. Which you can find anywhere on the internet anyhow. CharactersIt is the characters and the humor they bring to the table. The characters were pretty enjoyable to play against and that is its strongest selling point. Yes, if you play enough you will hear repeated dialogue but thats not an issue if you play in small session for the long term replay value say 30 minutes-1 hour a day.PrizesI found earning items and skins to change the style of the environment also a nice touch that adds some value to the overall game. Conclusion I would recommend this to anyone who just wants a quick break from their other games to enjoy hanging out with character personalities in a poker game.			"

												Much like Poker Night at the Inventory (1), this game features a unique gathering of various game characters, who find themselves by a poker table. Poker Night 2 offers a brillaint variety of banter between the players, much like what was seen in the first game, and it ranges anywhere from humerous comments on the other player's history to snide remarks about their deeds - if you think you can enjoy a couple of random game characters getting together and cracking wise at eachother's expense, then this is definitely a game for you. Additionally, unlike the first game, the actual poker gameplay is spot on what you would expect. No weird hangups, no weird glitches where a pair of twos will beat a straight. Definitely recommended for something to do when you feel like playing something casually, or just feel like wasting a couple hours with some humor.			"

This time Poker Night features Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (The Evil Dead), Sam (Sam and Max series) and GLaDOS (Portal) as your dealer.In Poker Night 2 you have the option of playing either Texas hold 'em or Omaha hold 'em. In either case, tournaments start with a $20,000 buy-in.An humorous opening sequence leads you down into the Inventory and introduces the characters. These characters will have fun lines to say on their own, but the real treat is when two or more characters talk with each other.Each character also has a special item that you can win from them that unlocks items in Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.Like in Poker Night at the Inventory the sequel has no multiplayer option, so you always play against the same opponents.The audio gags and discussions are amusing the first time you hear them, but they get annoying when you start hearing the same ones over and over again from one tournament to the next.All in all, if you are looking for a good poker game, then you should try Poker Night 2. The funny conversations and the items you can win make this a fantastic little game.Sounds 7/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Fun game to play Texas Hold Em with no limit, table customization and all in good fun with no competition or AHoles..I would have enjoyed a multiplayer ability to invite friends or play in online matchmaker type lobbys although I know the point of the game is to defeat and win the items off the other game characters that are your opponents...I'd give a 7.5/10 and wish they had a online save so I didn't reset my play on new installs.

												Ahh, Poker Night 2. I must admit, I was pretty ecstatic about this before release. This sequel to the original Poker Night at the Inventory combines the personalities of CL4P-TP from the Borderlands series, Ash from the Evil Dead series of movies and video games, Sam from the Sam and Max series GLaDOS from the Portal series, and lastly, Brock (What?) From the Venture Bros. TV Series. (Oh, also, Mad Moxxi from Borderlands is the bartender but she never says anything so ignore her.)Well, I'll just make this short and quick for all of you, just DON'T. This game, in my honest opinion, is just not worth buying. This game is not only a poker game, but it is also meant to be a comedy that you can get a good laugh out of as Poker Night 1 was. In Poker Night 1, I considered the interactions of Tycho (Penny Arcade) and the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) to be truly hilarious. However, this game in particular falls flat as both a poker game and a comedy. Firstly, to me, anyway, most of the lines were simply unfunny. They were either stale jokes that were easy to see coming, or puns. Plus, as if the lines weren't enough to ruin the comedy, there simply aren't enough of them. I can't count how many times I've heard Sam say ""Sure is, exciting, isn't it?"" in a row every single time he placed a bet. As a poker game, I'd say it falls flat in that the bots are far too ridiculous. It seems like every single hand the bots get is simply one card better than yours. For example, I got a flush with both of the cards in my hand, I enter a 1v1 showdown with Brock, who then beats me with a 1 card higher kicker than mine. (In Poker-ese, that's incredibly hard and unlikely.) But, if this was a one-time experience, I could understand it, it's just poor luck. But this seemed to be the case EVERY SINGLE TIME I got a good hand, though it may just be me whining, there seems to be very little reward for being able to read the bot's faces. They seem random, if anything, which in a poker game, is truly ridiculous. I do not recommend this game,»ZCC« Zombie Chicken			"

Short version: 90%Poker Night 2 is s step above the previous game in every way: more banter, better humour and opponent AI… it is simple more fun. It is probably the best poker game for this price, or even any price.Long version:Poker Night 2, just like its predecessor, tries to do what a few other poker games did by enhancing video poker with quality writing. Everyone you meet here is a known character from a known franchise (video games and motion picture alike), and they chat a lot. Their banter is not only full of humour, but somehow manages to feel natural, even when they talk about time travel or demons.The amount of spoken lines is impressive, and it can be boosted further by unlocking character-specific themes which all come with their unique bonus dialogues. This little addition can keep you in the game for quite a long time; it may take up to ten hours to unlock and hear everything.Good dialogues are great, but they couldn’t keep you around if the game is bad. Luckily TellTale managed to program a rather impressive AI for Poker Night 2; an AI that follows the characteristics of your opponents. They all have personalities and play accordingly… they sometimes even give small tells, if you look closely. Naturally they cannot substitute human players, but far as poker games go, Poker Night 2 is probably the best one you can get– and for a rather low price.			"

												This game is a perfect example of ""a joke isn't funny twice"". You'll laugh the first time you hear the dialogue, but after the second, third, and fortieth time, you'll be rolling your eyes and pressing keys on your keyboard trying to find the skip button before you get reminded that there isn’t one.+Free BL2 and TF2 items (honestly the best point to play this game)+Funny mix of characters. In my opinion, a better cast than Poker Night 1. +Banter between characters is funny...the first time (explained below)-Dialogue gets very old, very quickly. This can be unbearable for some of the longer dialogue scenes. Oh, and did I mention they're UNSKIPPABLE?-The same thing above applies to ""tells"" in the game. ""Don't be scared by the chips. Don't be scared by the chips"". - Tells are less common than in Poker Night 1, and more ambiguous-A.I. feels very cheap, moreso than the first game. Even if you have a very good hand, they will most of the time beat you with unbelievable ""god hands"". This is one of my core complaints. Some people may say that I'm whining. It is definitely possible to do well against the A.I., and I've found the correct rhythm to regularly win against the computer. However, doing this requires you to be incredibly defensive. You must play much more conservative in Poker Night 2 in comparison to real life poker games because of the complete BS hands that the computer can get. Even when you have a very high hand, the computer will manage to tie with you. When combined with the gruelingly repetitive dialogue, this game can really feel like a chore for the items. There are hundreds of cheaper poker games out there that simulate the experience much better than this.			"

Nice graphic and dialogue scriptsThe Bad:1. sometimes the lines get repetitive. 2. poker can be unexpectedly quite addictive, whether it's Texas Hold 'em or Omaha.

												Thanks to this game I now have a good idea as to how to play Poker.Initially I never knew how to play any type of poker but Poker Night 2 was just as good as a guide in playing it. Can't say I've mastered the game for sure since your enemies are basically AI and Poker mostly deals with more of bluffs and body language than luck. This game would have been a plus had it had an online multiplayer feature, but i guess this will do.What I enjoyed most about the game were the characters and in-game conversations. They are so funny, especially Glados. Just because of this game I feel like playing Portal 2 and watching the Sam and Max shows as well.Great game....you learn how to play it and have fun whiles playing it. 9/10			"

												This game should have been amazing. Poker Night at the Inventory was fun, and Poker Night 2 theoretically improves on every aspect of that game; the decks, tables, and themes you can purchase in-game are of an even better class than ever before, and Telltale pits you against a whole slew of characters who not only live up to, but surpass those of the first installment. On paper, everything is jolly and lovely. But when you first start up the game, you realize something is wrong...horribly wrong. The effort this game forces you to put in to earn its touted TF2 items is a far cry from the laid back nature of Poker Night 1's system. By the time you've earned the fifth, and arguably best, item the game has to offer, you've trudged through 15 disgusting challenges the game concocts for the sole purpose of extending the longevity of the game, all at the expense of the player's mental health. Any joy you may have derived from listening to the delightfully witty banter of characters such as Claptrap or Brock Samson will quickly turn in to teeth-gnashing fury as you feebly try to find a way to skip past all the fluff just to fail the tournament at a critical moment, with the bounties right out of your reach. What's worse, the items you can earn are intrinsically linked to the Steam achievements for the game, which means that, for the unlucky few out there (yours truly included), playing in offline mode prevents you from reaping your hard earned rewards. The proposed solution to this issue? ""Like we give a ♥♥♥♥, we already got your money, fool. Delete your save and try again"" - Telltale Games and Valve Support. ""P.S. You're our ♥♥♥♥♥ now, LOL""In short, this game can only have concievably been concocted in the deepest wretches of Hell, created through an unholy union between Satan, Cthulhu, and Duma Key, and fashioned from the filthy excrement of a million aborted fetuses. Do yourself a favor and pretend the Poker Night series never made it past the first installment. Even the greatest of masochists would pale at the thought of playing this   inhumane creation.Also, Sam is a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												So, about a year ago (at the time of writing, anyway) I was up at about 1am on New Year's Day, cider in my glass and I was playing Poker Night at the Inventory 1. It's a quirky game, with colourful visuals, great characters, great dialogue and some neat rewards. Oh, and there's poker. I had never played Texas Hold'em before (to this day, I think it's the only proper card game I've ever played) and after looking up the rules and having the tutorial fill in the blanks, I had a good idea of what to do. So much so, that I bought the sequel to play more and, more importantly, get more items for Team Fortress 2. I'll say it now; Poker Night 2 is definitely better than the first PN. If you haven't played the first one, I'd recommend it, mainly if you play TF2 like me. Now, that's enough backstory. On to the good stuff. (This review might be a bit on the long side).So, once again, you're back at the Inventory, playing poker against 4 colourful characters from various entertainment. The first PN had Strong Bad (Strong Bad), Max (Sam & Max), the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) and Tycho (Penny Arcade). Now, we have Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Ash Williams (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam & Max). In my opinion, this is a much better cast. It certainly feels more balanced as opposed to the craziness of the first game. Oh, and did I mention that GLaDOS is the poker table and commentator? I won't explain the rules of poker (the game has another tutorial for that anyway) but I'll list off the features. In PN 1, you would play poker, win different decks and tables and stumble upon a chance to win a TF2 item by beating the retrospective character yourself. This chance was entirely random, so if you only wanted the item (let's face it, that's what we all came for) you would have to keep hitting the 'restart' option and hoping that someone would put their item on the table. When you take into consideration the fact that characters would occasionally fold frequently (I'm looking at YOU, Tycho), this would make the matches rather tedious, as you have to keep trying to make characters bet whilst not making poor decisions and giving them more money (making it even more long and tedious). Thankfully, this system has changed. Now, you complete challenges to have a player place a bounty on the table. Win the tournament and an item for Borderlands 2 and TF2 is yours. Lose the tournament? The item will be back on the table by the next match, no resetting needed. Also, there are new tables, decks, chips and the introduction of themes. Apply all the items in a set and the Inventory gets a BIG visual overhaul, changing the lighting, the background and giving the retrospective character a slight outfit change. There are also special cutscenes and dialogue that occur with these themes, both of which are quite entertaining. Seriously, the cutscenes with Steve in the Borderlands 2 set are some of the funniest moments in this game. More features include a second mode of 'Omaha' poker (again, there's a tutorial) and being able to buy drinks for the other characters, making them reveal 'tells' more often (basically, hints about the strength of their deck Yes, I said DECK). There's also a cheatsheet that covers all the possible hands but if you've learned poker then you'll probably know these.Finally, the dialogue is worth mentioning too, it's that good. It ranges from references, to asking others about their universes and some great humour (particularly with Claptrap). It stops the gameplay from seeming too stale and makes it more entertaining, even if you hear certain lines multiple times (I'M LOOKING AT YOU GLADOS). Now, the game isn't perfect. Some challenges may take time to beat and despite this, the replay value isn't that large. But, for what it is, Poker Night 2 is a solid sequel and a great poker game. If you own TF2/Borderlands 2, played the first PN, or both, pick it up for some good entertainment. 8.5/10			"

												Poker Night 2 is one of those sequels which is mechanically comparable to the preceding title, but more charming and polished. The first game delivered a poker experience with four pop media figures, the second gives you the same, with different figures. The new selection is both more interesting, and better presented, as befits a sequel.The player, voiceless, is ruthlessly teased by their opponents. Brock Samson plays with an appropriate sort of serious absurdity, the most grounded competitor. Claptrap is as annoying as he is in his birth title, and you'll enjoy when he leaves the table. Ashley Williams is so aggressive, you may let Sam handle him. Sam is the cautious, ruthless player who almost always plays his cards.All in all, if you want a more challenging poker experience with better - more varied - dialogue and interaction between the characters, buy Poker Night 2, and have a night to remember. And then another. And another.			"

												This game is pretty much what it sells itself as, nothing more or less.  It's a Texas Hold 'Em tournament featuring fictional characters from somewhat recent games, and two cultural characters known from outside gaming.  LucasArts and Telltale veterans Sam and Max, and the damaged robots Claptrap and GLaDOS represent gaming, while Ash from The Evil Dead and Brock from The Venture Bros. round out the group.  Moxxie is the bartender, but you never interact with her.You play as yourself, never seen, against Brock, Claptrap, Ash, and Sam, while GLaDOS hosts and Max messes around off to the side.  The game then pretty much consists of playing Texas Hold 'Em while the characters chat and wisecrack at each other during the game.  While that's pretty much all there is to it, they do say some really funny things.  As you play, you can unlock special items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 by winning hands and completing challenges.  You also earn tokens you can use to buy drinks and themed items like cards, chips, and tables based on the franchises featured.  For me, this is one of the games I play just to wind down, and when I can't sleep.  It's not too involved, it's not risky or complicated, it's just poker.  With video games characters and jokes.  I just wish it wasn't Hold 'Em.			"

												Ah Poker Night 2. A poker sim with 5 players total. 4 From Different franchised games plus you the mute. This is a fun little poker game with very unique dialogues featuring Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from borderlands2, Ash WIlliams from Army of Darkness, Also Sam and max tag team this time around. GLADOS is the overseer of your hectic underground illegal poker game mocking you at any chance she gets. Some scenes will make you LOL. The core game is fun and quirky but is missing a lot of features to make this a complete poker game. You are forced to do 5 players  no more no less. There is no online or multiplayer at all. There are a few sets of unlockable decks, chips, and themes  based on each character to add some replayability and try to experience all the dialogue. CPU strategy can be messed around buying them drinks from the bar so they are not always predictable. In the end Poker Night 2 does leave you wanting so much more and proves poker games have a  place on steam. You can't beat its asking price of 5$ 1$ if on a sale. So I deff recommend it even if you don't know poker or only like 1 of the characters.Final Score 7.5/10			"

												This is how the game works: You get a hand that is hardly ever beaten. The NPC's cards are most likely crap compared to it, at least if you have played some poker you know it's not very likely everybody has better cards than you every single game.Now depending on your playstyle their cards are adjusted by the game to punish you for being too sure of your hand.If you play ""reasonably"", you might get away with your hand and beat all of the others.Doesn't matter how good your hand is or if your winning chance is 99% after you decided to go All In with it, during the next move the game will place cards that definitely beat yours in your opponent's hands. Your winning chance switches from 99% to 1%. This happens on a regular basis. The game just counters your hand and whatever you have, you WILL be punished.Sometimes every NPC has ridiculously good cards to make sure your good cards are countered, which means every single one of them has a Flush, a Full House and so on. But this only happens when you dare to go All In too quickly.If one of the NPCs goes All In though with a 2 and a 7 (yes, this happened) before even the flop is revealed, they win the game with it. So - not fun at all. The lines of every character are terribly annoying and you can't skip them or keep playing during them. It is like watching the same 3 cutscenes again after every move, and some of them are very long. I would play PN1 again, but this game? No way. Just grabbed all the TF2 items and deinstalled forever.			"

												It is just as someone else already pointed out. The game is clearly biased towards the AI, regularly providing them with very strong hands and even dealing cards that have already been played. It seems as if the developers wanted to stretch the game to make sure that players listen to all of the dialoge between the AI characters (which is obviously the actual point of the game). In order to achieve that, they mess with hands probabilities big time, let alone basic logic.As long as you don't care about the actual poker game going on and just want to hear some funny conversations, you will likely enjoy this game for a few hours. However, if you're looking for a competent poker game and assumed Poker Night 2 would deliver that while also offering a fun setting, you'd better give this one a pass.			"

												On sale for less than $2, this game could be dog ♥♥♥♥ in a bag and it might still get a positive recommendation... As it turns out, this is actually a brilliant way to spice up a game of virtual Poker.  Great characters, plenty of well done voice acting, interesting unlockables, and good atmosphere (revealing that last card can be very suitably tense).Some of the jokes get old after you hear them over and over, especially the long ones though.Shame it never got DLC to expand the cast of AI players, I wouldn't mind rotating players in and out every now and then.

												Poker Night 2 is a card game that you are in a league with famous characters from games, namely: Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam and Max series). Which is developed and distributed by Telltale Games with release date April 23, 2013.This game is a continuation of Poker Night at the Inventory game, which has the same premise tournament, however the characters involved are others.In gameplay is simple and easy to perform any function, even the biggest problem is to learn the rules of the game, despite having a short tutorial that is very functional.The goal of the game itself is very simple, have the best combination of cards and win the opponents to only have you at the table, that is, the new champion. There is also the missions which completing a number unlocks the chance to win a special item, can say a sort of trophy, and each character has a unique item, these trophies not only count as an advance in the game, but also release exclusive items for players of Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2.In addition to the trophies the game also features unlockable visuals that are purchased with tokens which are earned when making point in the tournament (between 10 and 50 chips) and winning (100 chips).Three modifiable items: chips, the table and the cards.Joining 3 items of a theme change the scenario as a whole and makes the character belonging to use a ""custom"" different.The game despite being a genre where the seriousness tends to be better, ultimately happens several dialogues and comedic interactions, which increase to the character of the scenery. (The other characters also interact with different scenarios). Among the players there are secondary characters as GLaDOS (Portal 1 & 2), Max (Sam and Max series), Steve and Moxxi's (Borderlands 2). Although the only character portal be a sort of secondary, there is also a trophy and setting the same.Things that caught my attention in particular:- Customizable for the game, which give a totally new and more attractive face.- Items and trophies that serve to encourage the player to get 100%.- Several scenes and dialogues that change during gameplay.- I found particularly good addicting game.I picked up this game without any pretense me hold or even being afraid of not being able to go away for never having played Hold'Em or any other for the tournament. I admit that every match was surprised with the amount of dialogues and small scenes, like when I found out everything I told here. After +/- 10 hours, I even I am a little better and I have a fair amount of victories.The matches have about 20 minutes each, but depending on your walk, you can have 10 minutes where you give all in and lose everything, even when the cards are not good you jump several times which may lead to 30 -40 minutes on average.There were few times which I came across an error in the game and despite everything that happened not really detracted from the gameplay: character cross in front of the camera and vr inside and some dialogue hang for about 1 or 2 seconds, however were really times were rare. I think for sure the game is worth it, because I believe so much who is playing the characters, humor them or even learn about a new sport. Will get yes please everyone.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.			"

												If you enjoyed playing Poker Night at the Inventory, then your going to love it's sequel. Taking place at the same old Inventory, only this time it's a game of Texas Hold Em or Omaha against Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams from Evil Dead, and Sam from Sam and Max, while the mechanical GLaDOS from Portal acts as the dealer in this game. The gameplay is more challenging this time with more money then the last game, and every so often the players will either try to raise the blinds or go all in, it's a real gamble to see if your going to win or not. The game introduces the Inventory Tokens that act as your currency to buy beer for the players or to purchase Table Felts, Cards, and Chips, as their are 5 Table Sets. Buying drinks will sometimes help the player see their tells while unlocking the Table Sets from a specific theme will give the Inventory a new look, as well as some special dialogue for the characters along with some entertaining eliminations to the players. The exclusive items are back for both TF2 and Borderlands 2, by completing specific tasks, someone will place a Bounty Item on the table in which you have to win the tournament instead of knocking them out to win the item. I recommend playing Omaha to win the Bounty Items as you'll have a better chance in getting a good hand most of the time. Just like it's predecessor, the dialogue is wonderful to listen to, it's not that often you see 3 video game characters, a TV show character and a Film character having a nice friendly and comical chat together. I only had a few issues with this game, mainly the missions you need to complete to unlock a bounty challenge, some of them are simple while others rely on luck to complete them, and that tends to be annoying. And once again, no Online play. But other then that, Poker Night 2 is an epic game and since it's only $5.00 like it's predecessor, it's worth it. Especially when you can unlock Sam's hat in TF2 which is awesome!			"

												I love poker and I'm a big fan of Borderlands and Telltale, what could go wrong? A lot actually.....This game is really frustrating and has nothing to do with poker, the players have no range at all and you don't have any fold equity. One exemple: 3 players with the same stack, 2 of them go all in on a A J 9 flop, the third one then call with 3 6 offsuit (no flush draw possible, no odds whatsoever). No one would ever do that, and it actually happens every two hands on that game. At no point I felt like playing poker or had any pleasure sitting at the table. The characters are not funny, especially when they only have 5 different lines each. So you'll hear them making the same comments again and again.....and again. The pace of the game is very slow, every time someone talk, the game is paused even if the people talking are not in the hand.If you like poker, don't play that game. If you don't know poker and would like to have a taste of it, for the love of god don't play that game and seek any other poker games out there. The only point of playing it would be if you really want the downloadable contents for Borderlands 2 or TF22/10 (1 point for the downloadable contents and 1 point because Claptrap), would fold again			"

												Poker Night 2 is a great improvement on Poker Night 1, offering new opponents, 10 exclusive items (5 for TF2 and 5 for Borderlands 2), items that change the theme of the whole Inventory, the Omaha game mode (I prefer Hold 'Em as a great Hold 'Em hand often becomes a terrible Omaha hand) and GLaDOS AS THE DEALER. The dialogue and animation are even better than the original, and the AI seems to be scarier - rounds rarely end without at least one opponent going all in. A few negatives: quite a lot of typos in the subtitles; Brock's dialogue is a bit quiet sometimes; no options to reduce the amount of chatter; didn't seem to work well with a controller.			"

												This game will frustrate you.This game will seem rigged.This game will put you in imaginary debt.10/10 would lose $100,000 in half an hour again.Review Revision #1:Before reading this edit, bear in mind I play (almost exlusively) the Omaha game mode, which is identical to Texas Hold'Em except you get dealt 4x cards instead of two and you pick two from your hand to make the 5.There are many things wich annoy me about this game. For example:-- There's plenty of dialog in this game that not only gets repetative and annoying, but also is unskippable. This is simply frustrating.-- I don't play a lot of poker outside of this game, nor do I know the probabilities associated with different hands, but the hands will go on seemlingly long streaks of good or bad cards on the same players over serveral hands. What I mean is: you might have bad cards for up to ten or so hands while one or two of the AI have great cards for the hands. Whether or not this is typical of poker, this does get infuriating.-- The AI bet without logic a lot of time. I've seen the AI go all in to $10k - $20k+ on an Ace High hand after the River (5th) card has been delt. Nobody in their right mind goes all in on that much money with only a high card. There are so many other betting discrepancies that it's not funny.-- Going on the above point, the amount of betting that occurs before the first three cards are delt is rediculous. With a $20k buy in on you + 4x AI players, I've seen the pot hit $30k+ before the first three cards are delt. There is no hand worth a pot that much without seeing those first cards.-- The AI don't change their play styles and if you're paying attention even a quarter of the time, it's very predictable who you'll be facing off againt at any given point. For example, I've elimintate 3 out of the 4 AI players many times, but never have I ever not eliminated Ash.-- Another example is early game, Sam folds a lot. I'm not kidding. I've seen a player been busted out and somebody's up $20k+ before he ever makes any bet what-so-ever (apart from the blinds).-- There are too few unlockables and you earn way too many tokens. It is so easy to earn the tockens required to unlock all the skins for the decks, table and room, so you're left with all these excess tokens. The only thing other than those unlocks that you can spend the tockens on is drinks for the other AI players. This is not only fruitless half the time, but also doesn't seem to stem the tide of tockens you earn.-- This is perhaps my biggest complaint: There is not Multiplayer! No multiplayer mode, no online server (dedicated or otherwise), no LAN, no nothing! This means that not only can you not play with your friends, but the game itself gets extremely repetative after while because there's not enough variety in the AI and, as mentioned before, there's problems with the hands delt and the AI betting.As you might be able to tell from my above list, there is so much about this game that annoys me. That being said, I kinda like and kinda dislike how easy it is to grind out all the achievements. Also, it does seem to be a half-decent time filler or TV companion. For example, if you're watching a movie or TV (especially if you're watching it on a second computer monitor), it's a fun enough game to play while watching.Overall, it's not a particullary great game and is definitely lacking (especially in the multiplayer department), but if you can pick it up cheap, then it's definitely worth it. Giving it a 6.5/10			"

												First off, let me start with this: This is a great game if you enjoy poker or the personalities of the characters involved, BUT Don't pay full price for it. There simply isn't that much content to justify even a $5 price tag. You only get two poker modes, Texas and Omaha, and the dialogue becomes very repetitive after awhile. You CAN unlock some new dialogue options by winning consistently and buying full sets of unlockables (card decks, chips, and table covers for each character) but the dialogues are still random so the new stuff may take awhile to pop up. The game regularly goes on sale as much as 80% off, which is a very fair price.			"

												First of all, if you do not like poker, I don't think you will like this game. Don't get me wrong, the poker part of this game is only like 10% of the game.So, if this is a poker game, but the actual poker playing in it is only 10% of this game, what makes this game worth while? One thing: Excellent screenwriters! In this game you play poker against four persons, Claptrap from Borderlands, Sam from Sam & Max, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros and Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams from Evil Dead. These guys have the most amazing and hilarious things to say, and I can honestly say I'm not sure I've heard it all even though I played a lot of hours! The screenwriters in this game have tied together these characters in a way that many other games can't do, and since these are all loveble characters from already known media, you will probably already know them and recognize some things they talk about. The thing that keeps one playing this game is first of all the conversations, but secondly the achievements. when you play against these guys you unlock different boards and enviroment of the room you play in, you also win different ""famous"" items from these guys, so there are quite a few things to do. But yeah, I really recommend this game AS LONG as you enjoy poker.Oh, and did I mention Glados is the one who's the dealer? Great fun!And you get stuff to Borderlands 2 by playing this! It's a win win situation!			"

												Poker Night 2 is a game you want to play if you feel like playing some cards and relaxing a bit. The comments of the NPC's become a bit repetative at times but they are funny and that goes a long way. The action itself is a bit slow paced, mainly because the game takes some time to present you with the NPC's dialogues in between hands. You can however skip to the next hand if it is your turn. The NPC's poker AI isn't all that bad, they can surprise you with some bold and unexpected moves but after a few hours of play you will start to see a pattern. They will occasionally break the pattern though, which makes it exciting. You can collect throphy's and themes for the poker room which is pretty straight forward but fun nonetheless.If you judge this game for what it is (a cool way to play cards and have a laugh) and not for what it isn't (a poker tournament simulator) then you will have a lot of fun playing it.I would give it 7.5 out of 10.

												After playing this game for a couple of games, I think I've finally grasped how the card game 'Poker' works.Every turn, you randomly click buttons on the table, hoping that the dealer tells you that you've succeeded. If you succeed, you are given an ancient and powerful artifact, capable of destroying or enslaving the human race entirely. I have used this to great effect by traveling back in time and enslaving most of an entire race, before I was almost assassinated in my sleep and forced to come back to this era to write this review.Overall I give this game about a 6.8 out of 10, due to the amount of vomiting that has occurred due to rituals involving bear urine and anthrax. I heavily suggest this game to anybody looking to learn how to play Poker.			"

												In comparison to the first game, this one brings in a new Omaha game mode which is fun, however after an hour I'm listening to the same chit-chat dialogue over and over again.I loved the first Poker Night as it was fun to listen to all the dialogue of the characters, but Poker Night 2 is better with the sound off.You'd be better off listening to a stuck record for a few hours, or simply buy / play the first Poker Night over this one "

												The first one was more fun. The character in this one weren't as funny or interesting, and frankly Claptrap was annoying.This version of the game did not add much to the franchise or the library of poker games. My suggestion.. buy the first one. (although it is on sale for $1, which aint bad.)			"

												This is by far the best video poker game I've ever played, it easily teaches how to play poker as you play, the AI is the most challenging and most complex yet, and you feel like you are actually there in the scenario, playing poker with real people, only the people you play against are iconic pop culture characters.The characters have an endless amount of dialouges, but once you play about 20 matches they say the same thing every time, another problem i have with this game is that you don't get to be a certain character, you're always known as ""that guy who's mute"" you don't really get to establish a friendship with the characters like in other TTG games (then again, this game mocks you for being a nerd playing virtual poker).This game is certainly great, it's a shame it's overshadowed by it's partnership with Team Fortress 2 items, it is honestly a great game to play besides getting those TF2 items.If you love poker, this is a must have, far more better than Poker Night 1.TL;DR Very complex and puzzling AI, easy to adapt inside the game and just fun poker time, dialouge gets overused when it runs out and you don't get to have a character as a protagonist for a game that immerses you in a virtual reality.Just buy it.

												Poker Night 2 is not your typical type of poker game. It's not about ploughing through those hands per hour and getting as much action in as you can. It's all about attempting to create an atmosphere akin to a game with friends. The most important thing in the game for me, is the characters and how they interact with each other and the player. The game has a lot of dialouge, and there's a few conversations between a couple of the characters, which is a nice change from the odd quip here and there.The addition of a GlaDOS as the dealer is great, I could listen to her speak all day I think. I also like that Moxxi's manning the bar, I was disappointed she didn't even have a word to say though.Overall the characters have a good amount of lines, but not enough. I was getting repeats of the conversations within an hour of playing. I'm sure there's stuff I haven't heard yet, but I can tell that there's not enough dialouge. On the other hand. The game is priced at £3.99. I can't expect the voice acting that we've come to expect in our games.I would've really liked to have seen more characters. Even another two characters would make things more exciting. I don't mind playing short-handed (there's only ever a maximum of 5 players at the table), and having two characters able to rotate in with the rest would make each game feel a little different.The AI has been vastly improved since the preceeding game. The NPCs all seem to have a distinctive style of play, which once figured out makes things a little easier. The tell system is often a complete giveaway. An observant player should never lose a tournament.One thing that hasn't improved from the last game is the horrible UI. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to find the right raise sometimes. I'd love to be able to type in a number, or have incriments of chips I can drag to the table. It does the job, but it could be better. The bounty system is quite fun, being presented with challenges to complete keeps things interesting. I'm enjoying unlocking the chip-sets, decks and felts as I accumulate more tokens based on my performance on each table. One of my favourite features in the game is that if you activate the deck, chip-set and felt from the same set the UI changes to be stylised to match. There's also a couple of other changes, but I wont spoil them for you!Something else that I like is that if you're unfortunate enough to be knocked out you can watch the rest of the game play out. The game will even show you the NPCs cards.Overall, every damning point about the game can be easily defended by it's wonderfully low price. Personally, I would love to have seen a bigger game, even if it was sold at 3-4 times the price. I think they could have increased the price point to $10 and added some more content without losing a considerable amount of sales, but I guess that's not the type of game this is.Bottom line: Casual poker fun with great characters at a great price.

”Hail to the King, baby.” -Ashley WilliamsWith the myriad of video games that have been introduced throughout the years depicting intense scenes of hardship, degradation, and redemption, I am certain there are some characters that would prefer to just take it easy and play some table games every now and then. Poker Night 2 (PN2), the sequel to the ever-popular Poker Night At The Inventory, was published by in 2013 by Telltale Games, and allows the player to ante-in to a one-game poker tournament with individuals the likes of Brock Samson from the Venture Bros.  television show, Claptrap from the Borderlands series, Sam from the classic Sam and Max detective adventures, and-my personal favorite-Ashley Williams from the  Evil Dead/Army of Darkness trilogy. Poker Night 2 is exactly as you expect it to: as a card game computer simulator; there’s really no explanation needed for this. However, this title offers much more than just a deck of cards and green felt.Here are a few reasons to consider Poker Night 2:Gameplay - This title is not so much a continuation of the last episode as it is a familiar experience with a different set of familiar faces. The player is re-invited to the Gallery, the venue for the first game’s setting, to partake in more tournaments with an increase buy-in amount. The player may challenge said opponents to two variations of poker, being Hold’Em and Omaha. There is nothing truly outstanding about the game’s mechanics other than being able to purchase drinks for other competitors to throw them off of their game, though it does have a unique facial-reading system in which the player may gauge the others’ dealt hands by viewing simple responses to them. PN2 primarily utilizes a mouse interface to select options in menus and during tournaments; this is as simple as it can get. Why I added this section, however, is to touch a bit on the other competitors’ ruthless cunning during tournaments. I am usually pretty decent at poker and other card games, but this character cast knocks me down a peg both competitively and morally at times by taking outstanding risks to oust everyone else from the game.Humorous Cast - Along with the stated characters, Mad Moxxi from the Borderlands tends the bar, Portal’s GLaDOS is the card dealer, Tales from Monkey Island’s Reginald Van Winslow reprises his role as the Inventory’s host, and Max-Sam’s faithful partner and competitor in the first Poker Night-sits idly by, awaiting moments to add to the comedic dialogue exchanges; a random bandit from Borderlands named Steve also makes appearances from time to time, but mostly remains hidden from the scenes. Each individual around the table converses with one-another fluidly, and intriguing conversations arise both about the game at hand and of everyday lives, such as Brock Samson’s mentioning of his employers or Sam and Max respectively spouting back and forth. These witty exchanges remove much of the tension from each session so that the tournament simply feels like a friendly game among friends.Unlockables - Poker Night 2, similar to the original, features content that may be revealed through play. After each session, whether the player won or lost, tokens are earned that may go toward purchasing various themed table felts, chips, cards, or alcoholic beverages during games-which simplify the ‘tells’ from the opposition. Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 also benefit from Poker Night 2, as players may equip items such as Sam’s signature hat in TF2 and Brock Samson’s haircut for the Gunzerker in Borderlands 2, respectively; these unique articles are rewarded for obtaining Bounties, challenge items unique to each character’s respective games.TL:DR - Though not complex, this title can be extremely cut-throat in nature, especially when there are few remaining players. Conversation is intriguing given it is between various characters that will very likely never meet again, and livens up the play experience with quirky yet witty lines. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys playing table games with brutal adversaries. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews.

 A Poker Game With Unusual Friends.What To Expect From This Game?This game is about gambling $20,000.00 against some irregular players in a game of poker. Your opponents will frown, laugh, chat, bluff and make threats in order to win the tournament. There are two modes of Poker to play for each tournament that will offer new challenges and achievements to complete. When the player successfully completes a tournament, money will be won, tokens to be gained and a possible prized trophy to be received. The player will laugh or cry and possibly kiss his/her money goodbye.What Are The Pros Of This Game?  Movie/Cartoon/Game Characters (Original Voice Actors)  Good Game Controls  Good Graphics  Fun & Entertaining Conversations  Alternate Setting Changes  Alternate Elimination SequencesWhat Are The Cons Of This Game?  Limited Players (No Variety Of Characters To Play Against)  No Conversation Interaction With Players  Repetitive Conversations  Opponents Have Higher Luck Advantages  Empty Threats  No Fighting (Who Wouldn't Enjoy Seeing Brock VS Ash)Would You Recommend This Game?Yes, I recommend this game for the fans of the characters in this game. It is interesting to see such characters interact with one another, but it is a shame the player (he or she) cannot engage in conversation or interact with them too. Puchasing drinks for other players is the only interaction with the characters in this game. I know this game is purposely released as a ""Poker"" game, but the developers could of enable more options for the player to interact by asking or answering questions or get into a brawl. However, the game does very well of being a simple card game simulator. My other complaint is there should of been more opponents to play against other than Ash, Brock, Claptrap and Sam. **Game Tip: Expect to ""Fold"" a lot in this game due to bad hand dealt to player percentages.Fold, Bet, Raise or All-In For A Game Of Poker !!!

												While I've very much enjoyed the original Poker Night at the Inventory, it's sequel, Poker Night 2, is generally quite lackluster and omits vital customizations included with its predecessor. First and foremost, you can no longer skip the table chat and cannot change the amount of discussion by the other players. While amusing at first, it doesn't take long to exhaust the included dialogue, leading to hearing the exact same gags game after game after game. There's also the bizarre choice by the developers to include Ash from the Evil Dead film series, yet the character isn't voiced by Bruce Campbell. Instead we're treated to a thoroughly awful impersonation, both in terms of performance and writing. Furthermore, the way they use Claptrap makes me even less likely go any further with Borderlands, though in part this stems from how often he repeats himself, yet never shuts up. The high point of the game would be GLADOS from the Portal series, handling the job of dealer. Sadly that doesn't do too much for me when I really dislike most of the other players. Sam from Sam & Max is cool, but as is true to his character, also rather low key. I really thought this would be an excellent sequel, but I'm disappointed to say that I'll be keeping Poker Night at the Inventory as my default casual poker game and will merely make use of Poker Night 2 on rare occasions when I feel like something different. One and a half stars out of four.			"

												It's poker with all new characters and unlockables, what more do you want ? Well, for starters, I wish I knew how to play poker. Properly.The characters and environments are pretty sweet looking and the voice acting is superb. But since it's a poker game you'll probably have heard all the lines after only one hour has passed. And let me tell you, there are a lot of conversations. At times I just wanted everyone to shut up so I could play in peace.But, for a price this low I can only recommend it, especially if you know how to play cards (and enjoy it at the same time). If you loved the first one there's no doubt you'll love the second one as well.[Rating: 77/100]			"

Now lets talk about the ""Play to Win!' mechanic. The way to win items is so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its not even funny. First you have to complete three objectives, and then you have to win an entire tournament for one (or two depending on if you have b2 and tf2) item. Doesnt seem hard, but it really is.

												The reason you're playing a Poker Night game is for the characters, and Poker Night 2's cast is excellent. Claptrap is at his annoying best, Sam (and Max, from the bench) are amusingly absurd, Ash is as smooth as he was in Evil Dead, and Brock is voiced impeccably - and aggressively - by Patrick Warburton. The dealer, namely Glados, is at her acerbic best, humiliating and degrading at every opportunity. If those characters sound like fun to you, you'll have an enjoyable poker sim to play.As for the unlocks, while I can't speak for the Team Fortress 2 items, the Borderlands 2 items are excellent and humorous. Playing as a human-sized turret from Portal is worth the price of admission by itself.Note to achievement hunters and perfectionists: unlike the last Poker Night game, the achievements in PN2 are all fair (Poker Night 1 required a victory by straight flush for its final achievement, a 72,192 : 1 chance).

												Do you like card games? Do you even consider yourself a cardshark, able to take off the most skilled bluffers and gamblers singlehandedly? Well try out this Poker game by Tell Tale Games. If you beat it, you can feel not robbed... but reconsider, they might rob you off your time. The personas in this game are well drawn, and very coherent in their behavioural patterns. As soon as you have learned what specific sentences or motions mean, you'll know when they are bluffing. This game is fun to play, as long as you don't overdo it, playing more than a tournament a day doesn't do anything good. The achievements in this game are a gift, they are reached easily most of the time - that is, if you don't blunder on an epic scale.I recomend this game to all people who like a good set of cards, and to friends of Evil Dead, Sam & Max, Borderland-Series, Portal... Oh, yes I have forgotten Brock ^^ Well - never mind.			"

												Everyone buys for tf2 items but as a poker game it's not that good.  High bets or all ins can often get everyone to fold.  It does have good humor and when it's on sale it's worth the price.If you don't want the tf2 items I think the price is still worth the humor.			"

												EXTREMELY WORTH BUYING. A HALOVER9000 BEST BUY. for what that's worth.Mouse-only. For this alone, it is a good game. Go ahead and read this, because you don't have a life. Nor do I. The review gives: Why One Might Buy, Should I Buy, How To Win, and Bonuses.Be honest; many of us now game instead of watch movies or infomercials to fall asleep. Mouse-only is crucial then, as well as when wanting to Let Her Sleep, or when encumbered with the flu.Then there are those who relish the mashup in music, the homages (pronounced oh-MAHH-zhes) to predecessors in science-fiction movies, and cross-cultural expansions in gaming. This game, like Poker Night At The Inventory, directly uses other iconoclasts from other games and media. Seeing them interact, regardless of your opinion of some of them, is good for dozens of hours of entertainment.OK, for poker, it's a bit tougher than other games.........Several of the players are cavalier, and at least one is as cold as steel. Hence, drink tokens. They're not just useful for seeing Moxxi's lady parts walk by. One can earn, and spend selectively, drink tokens to instantly change much of the other players' conducts and rule systems.OK, for poker, then it can be a bit easier than other games........BONUSES: Winning drops up to 5 Team-Fortress-2 items. Winning also drops up to 5 skins/accessories for Borderlands-2. Winning a Borderlands-2-themed tournament also gives an extra Badass Rank point to spend in BL2. And A Perfect Steam Achivement Game might be easier than with other games. I'm a Waaay Casual Gamer, and I have all but one Steam Achievement on this game.At five bucks each, both Poker Nights are worth it. At $2.49, you should be buying both on the spot. And, if they're ever 99 cents again, it's a NO-BRAINER.I'm Hal Over 9000; I'm nobody; this is me caring about you.			"

												The reason you're playing a Poker Night game is for the characters, and Poker Night 2's cast is excellent. Claptrap is at his annoying best, Sam (and Max, from the bench) are amusingly absurd, Ash is as smooth as he was in Evil Dead, and Brock is voiced impeccably - and aggressively - by Patrick Warburton. The dealer, namely Glados, is at her acerbic best, humiliating and degrading at every opportunity. If those characters sound like fun to you, you'll have an enjoyable poker sim to play.As for the unlocks, while I can't speak for the Team Fortress 2 items, the Borderlands 2 items are excellent and humorous. Playing as a human-sized turret from Portal is worth the price of admission by itself.Note to achievement hunters and perfectionists: unlike the last Poker Night game, the achievements in PN2 are all fair (Poker Night 1 required a victory by straight flush for its final achievement, a 72,192 : 1 chance).

												Ahh Poker. A game for great war heros, not tiny baby men. You, the player, must face off your age old nemsis, the A.I., in a high stakes showdown for honor, glory, and  helluva bunch of virtual chippies. Face off against iconic characters like Claptrap from Borderlands, Sam from Sam & Max, and GLaDOS from Portal, and prove to them your the richer man (Unlike me, who's 300,000 dollars broke). Win awesome prizes and rewards for bonus content in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands. Show lady luck that you don't need her to win! (Oh, and there's also Omaha but I have no idea what that is but PLAY IT ANYWAYS).Without a doubt, this game scores very high on the list of games that probably died and went to valhalla.                                                                                                                                                                        ~THEHAMMERNOOB			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Poker Night 2. Amusing High Stakes Poker with a Hint of Potential AI Cheating.Genre: Single Player Comedy Card Game. Developed and Published by: Telltale GamesPlatform: Windows and MacOSX. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsIt’s a cross-over poker game, plain and simple. Where the player plays against four other characters from different universes in media The four characters, Brock, Ash, Claptrap and Sam, add to the atmosphere chatting and bantering to each other. They’ll talk about events in their universes, stories of what happened to them and generally hang out. It’ll help to know at least half of the cast or much of the humor/references will go over your head. As far as the poker aspect is concerned, there’s the option to play either Texas Hold'em or Omaha rules. The objective is to win the Poker Tournament and not lose the $20K buy-in. Good luck, you’re probably going to need it. This game has a vicious difficulty that I can only surmise is due to quite a bit of cheating on the AI’s part. Far too many times I’d have a pair of aces only for the AI to bet high and get a straight or flush. That’s one example of many where the AI feels far too omniscient for its own good. Even if it isn’t cheating, it’s way too convenient how many times the other players win. Outside of winning poker, you can get chances at earning each character’s special trophy and earn poker coins to unlock cosmetic items. To get said chance at winning a character’s special trophy item, you’ll need to complete the objectives given to you. Once you’ve done that, win a tournament. Again, good luck on that.  The Characters and InteractionsIt's a pretty good selection of characters in this game that work off each other rather well. Claptrap is his usual self. So, you’ll like/dislike him just as much you do in Borderlands. GLaDOS makes for an entertaining poker dealer with her usual biting barbs at the contestants. I didn’t find Ash Williams to be all that interesting. I’m curious why they picked him over any other number of Telltale characters they could have used. Brock is an amusing straight man and carries himself well. While Sam makes his entrance to the series with Max in the background being, well, Max. They tell some interesting stories and really, this is where the meat of the game is. Which shouldn't be surprising as Telltale is really good with character interactions. There's quite a bit of amusment to be had just hearing these five characters talk to each other. Whether its about how good that bet was or what kind of dog Sam is, there's quite the range of subjects brought up at The Inventory. You'll get at least a couple of hours of lines that are new or fresh before they start getting repeated. After that, you'll hear quite a few lines repeated with a the occasional story being brought up now and then. PC Settings and Stability ProblemsGraphics options are pretty limited. There’s a rendering quality slider that swaps between low and high. Anti-aliasing is only switchable between on and off. Additionally, there’s a plentiful amount of screen resolutions and full-screen on/off. There’s music, sound and voice audio sliders as well as subtitles. The only gameplay options are “how to play”...so not much to be found here. There’s no difficulty slider so if you think the game is too easy/hard: you’re out of luck. I should also note that there isn’t any Steam Cloud support. Upon replaying it for this review, I had it crash on me a couple of times for no discernable reason. I did try making it a windowed game and that seemed to help but I can’t be 100% certain that fixed it. There’s also been a number of reports on the Steam community that also seem to indicate crashing problems with the latest releases of Windows 10. So, I’m not too sure how long this game will continue to run if it’s this unstable already. Final ThoughtsIf you’re going to pick up Poker Night 2, pick it up for the characters and interaction. Playing poker against AI is a tricky business at best and it’s easy to think its cheating even if it really isn’t. Though in this case, I do think PN2 is cheating at times. The convenience of how good their hands can be is just a little too much for me to buy. PN2 is good for a couple of hours and by then you’ll have heard all the fresh lines before the characters start repeating themselves ad nauseam. After that, there’s really not much of a reason to keep playing. Tells are too telegraphed and there isn’t much to really draw you in. Still, if you want to listen to GLaDOS berate Sam for making a lousy bet, I’ve heard of worse ideas. Read the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												First impression review!After replaying the first Poker Night at the Inventory, I decided to go ahead and get the second one during a sale. These are my first impressions of the game.First off, the atmosphere seems a bit less cozy, the chatter amount can't be changed nor can you skip the chats. I do find the new characters a bit dissapointing compared to the older crew, who felt a lot livier and these just throw more mean snarks and remarks instead of fully chatting with eachother. Although I do like the inclusion of GlaDOS as dealer, she's just an awesome dealer with the right amount of evil. Sam definitely makes more jokes with his partner compared to Max in part one, which is also nice.The poker itself felt as good as always with a better unlocking system than the previous one. The ability to buy the ones you want makes it a lot more rewarding. Since you don't have to wait for the ones you really want. There is a new gamemode, Omaha, but I haven't touched that one yet. Overall, the game still feels fresh and fun if you're bored of the first one. It has new jokes, new characters and new visual flair to unlock. There are a few things downgrades compared to the other one (unskippable stuff, lesser settings etc) but they're not too bothersome. So if you're a fan of the first, go ahead and try it out!			"

												Poker Night 2 is another excellent title from Telltale; they did a great job with the banter and captured the character personalities quite well. The voice acting is good and the interacting between characters doesn't seem forced. My only criticism would be the character AIs seem to respond to stimulus the same - it would be cool if Brock did more bluffing than Claptrap (for instance). I also did some experimenting and the computer responds the same regardless of the player's actions from hand to hand. If they wanted this game or a certain character to be really top-notch they should use some kind of Markov model to evaluate player actions. In any case this is a great choice for some casual gaming on a laptop or when you want to be able to walk away from a game for minutes or hours at a time during play. 8/10 for a casual title.			"

TL;DR nutshell - Fun poker game, great music (why can't it be purchased? *sad panda face*), fun dialogue, better than the first installment.  Downside is that it's pretty short, and the dialogue gets really repetitive.The ""Once she drinks coffee, she doesn't shut up for hours"" version:It's a decent game from Tell Tale.  We have the murder-machine Brock Samson from Venture Bros (highly recommended show to watch), the ever obnoxiously annoying CL4P-TP unit from the Borderlands franchise (play the games, they're fun), Ashley Williams from the Evil Dead franchise (I don't like horror so no opinion), and Sam from the Sam and Max franchise all together at the same table, being taunted and experimented on by with GLaDOS as your dealer.There are five challenges in total to get through to get the downloadable unlocks, and five felt/chip/card combos to get which have their own set of stories to go with them that don't appear if you only have one or two unlocks on.  The possible challenges are funny, as I don't know if I can actually deploy ninjas, want to take an asprin and call someone in the morning or do the hokey pokey.  Some are challenging as all get out, like ""Win with only a high card"".  This time around, there is no difficulty setting, which I found disappointing.  The music is amazing, especially the slow piano version of ""Still Alive"", and the variations on all of the theme tunes, like the opening theme to Borderlands 2 ""No Heroes"".The two complaints I really have are these: 1) the game is far too short, and getting the unlocks are too easy for the most part.  I end up deleting all of the saves and starting over, just to keep it interesting.2) they could have recorded a lot more dialogue, especially for GLaDOS.  Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is really funny, but to be told ""Well, that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior"" over and over and over and over and over again gets old fast.  That and their reactions to you going all in.It took a while for me to get the rules of Omaha, but I finally got it figured out.  Now, if I could only get into a showdown with someone other than Sam...Poker Night 2 is a good game to play while eating supper, or killing a few minutes before you have to leave.  It's not in any way a ""great"" game, but just a, ""Meh, I'll play this to murder some minutes while I eat/wait"".			"

The game involves you sitting at the poker table and playing against 4 other players. The AI is decent, but not great. This game is full of humour, however after a few hours it will become the same thing over and over again.Pros -Full of humorTeaches you the basics of pokerYou can get items for Borderlands 2 and TF2 Cons -Humor gets repetitive after a whileThere is no ""skip"" button to skip the repetitive dialogueUser Interface can be clunky and slow.I r8 this game 6/8 m8.

												Poker Night 2  is a very fun game to play.They have new caracters such as Claptrap and Ash who bring a funny and interesting factor when playing. Although I did not find myself playing this game for hour sittings, I found that it had much replay value to it. You can win cool in game items for the games Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I feel that a lot of people would buy this game just for those prizes so I wished that the Developers would have made it harder to get the items or to just win them 1 by 1 instead of 2 at a time. Poker Night 2 has two different game modes;holdem and ohama. You win tokens for playing the game to purchase stuff like different decks and  chips. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes card games as much as i do. And hey, for $5 what can go wrong?			"

												Poker Night 2  is a very fun game to play.They have new caracters such as Claptrap and Ash who bring a funny and interesting factor when playing. Although I did not find myself playing this game for hour sittings, I found that it had much replay value to it. You can win cool in game items for the games Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I feel that a lot of people would buy this game just for those prizes so I wished that the Developers would have made it harder to get the items or to just win them 1 by 1 instead of 2 at a time. Poker Night 2 has two different game modes;holdem and ohama. You win tokens for playing the game to purchase stuff like different decks and  chips. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes card games as much as i do. And hey, for $5 what can go wrong?			"

												I can't honestly say I'm that big of a poker player, but I do know how the game works and I think I safetly say that this is a pretty solid game.At only five dollars there is so much value here because it just isn't a simple poker game. Telltale has taken their IP's and in cooperation with Valve combined all the different characters from their games into a very entertaining game. Their care with regards to character, story telling and good writing really shows and make this game a the stand out that it is. Because without the funny dialogue this game could have so easily gone the other way and been utterly terrible.A more detailed review for a game that doesn't need a more detailed review can be found on my blog here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/09/poker-night-2.html.

												In all honesty if you want this game because it's poker it's a very poor game. It constantly reads the hand you have incorrectly - many many times I would have a straight or full-house but it'd only see a pair or two-pair. You'll be face palming so often your head will start to concave. Seriously how did this even pass play testing?If you want it for the TF2 and BL2 achievement items it's... alright? The items are only for looks. Which isn't really a bad thing. Some look better than others. Overall that's the main reason I keep playing it. I feel the items are needed to get my money's worth.The meaty part of this game though really is the characters. That part gets a 10/10. GLaDOS especially is hilarious. The only reason I recommend it is for the character appeal. It feels like you're really sitting down with some stars and not in front of a bunch of computers.If you know how to play poker this game will leave you infuriated at it's faulty programming. If you don't know how to play poker this game will confuse you even more, but you'll be less infuriated.			"

												The game Poker Night 2 is a quirky humor based poker game where you can play texas or omaha hold 'em. The game is simplistic and incredibly fun. The whole thing starts out with a basic intro to poker familiarizing you with all the different hands and basic winning strategies. While most play these games for the acheivement items you'll find yourself so unintentionally sucked in by it's charm that items will come without effort. The game RARELY has issues and the issues I'm talking about are things like an important flop being dealt that will skip some dialougue but the game tries to keep things like that at a minimum. All in all poker night 2 is a hallarious game that is without a doubt worth the 5 bucks it costs. BUY THIS GAME			"

												6.9/10 - Improvement on the Original in all areas.The first Poker Night really didn't do it for me; it felt incomplete and way too easy! This one however improves everything and closes those gaps from the first.If you like casual poker this is a good buy for $5.This installment has tournaments, stats, achievements and some pretty fun gameplay. You can also use your earnings to purchase decks, chips and various table felts. It DOES get annoying listening to the competition banter. Sometimes they will go on for quite a bit and as far as I know you can't skip it. It's like trying too hard to be funny and create additional interest. Overall; this is a fun poker offering. Worth $5. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												Poke Night 2, the sequel to the first Poker Night. I have mixed emotions about this game. For one, this game IS fun, but can get boring quickly and repetitive. Most people get this game for ""Team Fortress 2"" or ""Borderlands"" items. Lets start off with me saying that the first Poker Night didn't work on my OS even though it said it would. This, however, does work (Macbook Pro, Yosemite). This game IS self explanitory. It's basically just playing Texas Hold em'. Over. And over again.Really, theres not much to say. Get the game ONLY if you want to play cards alot OR to earn items for different games, even though it will take a while. If you are a nub like me, you wouldn't know how to play Texas Hold Em'. If you don't, don't get this game. Seriously, unless you want to take the time to learn.I do NOT recommend this repetetive game. Go out and play cards in real life with your friends and or family members. I rate this 4.5/10. Even though this game is on sale, I rather save my money for something else.			"

												I've made more money in this game, than the entirety of my GTA Online career.I haven't been insulted this much even in a public game of CSGO.I haven't been insulted this much even by my mother in law... well...I've never wanted there to be a ""flip table"" button in a game this much.I go all in since the cards are in my favor, 100%, only to have the last card ♥♥♥♥ me over because ofcourse.And it happened multiple times.Even Dark Souls wasn't as frustrating as this.I grew to appreciate how easy it was to get the achievement items in the original Poker Night.I haven't been in this much debt in all of the city builders out there, combined.I wouldn't want Claptrap to be left in a junkyard, since it'd be too cruel for the junkyard.Atleast I got cosmetic items.

												A fun game with bad poker mechanics, mostly amusing characters (I can barely stand Claptrap in the Borderlands series, he isn't much better here), and a bounty/unlockable reward system that half works. The challenge system for gaining the opportunity to unlock bounties is a step-up from the RNG of the last game (which lead to me restarting until I got bounty games after the dialogue became stale). GLaDOS is excellent as always, and having her as the dealer was a wise move.When it comes down to it though, actual poker players say it's nothing like playing poker, and the unlockable bounties for Borderlands 2 straight up don't work; it's possible to get them if you contact Gearbox support, but I think when you have to open a ticket to recieve what is debateably the biggest selling point of the game, the product is fundamentally flawed.This isn't a game for poker players or collectors.

												Let's compare to Poker Night 1: The dialogue started repeating much earlier, and you're no longer allowed to skip it. On the other hand, there were a couple of conversation arcs which were apprently set up to take place over the course of several sessions of play, which was interesting. I didn't suspect I'd like the cast of characters as much as the original, especially the guys on the right, but everybody turned out to be pretty likeable. There are still table, card and now chip style unlocks, and you don't need to win games to get them; instead, you're given three random 'challenges' which usually aren't too horrible, and then completing these challenges and winning a game unlocks cool stuff for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I guess it is a better system than the previous. Unlocking matching club motif sets actually changes the whole Inventory's look to that theme, such as a Borderlands one and a Portal one, and that was pretty cool. The AI now seems to cheat like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way more than I remember.Uuuuhhhh you know what, I'll just call it about even. Even if this one doesn't have Heavy Weapons Guy in it. Actually I was kinda hoping for the Engineer this time.			"

												NEW REVIEWEver wanted to sit and play poker without having to have your poker face on? Have you ever wanted to rage while playing poker? Then get this game! It's so RIGGED, you'll sit there with the best cards and still get your sassy lil' behind handed to you on a silver platter!I suggest shaving your head before you start playing this game, that way you won't be pulling your hair out. I shaved my head clean before I bought this game and it's one of the best things I've ever done, otherwise by now I would have baldspots from yanking my own hair outta my head! #beardgamestrongWould shave my head clean again to avoid looking like sh!t/10OLD REVIEWGreat Poker game! Hilarious Characters from other games, with epic dialogue between the Characters! The jokes are on fleek lol. Characters are Claptrap, Glados, Brock Samson, Ash Williams and Sam (with Max) and Moxxi bringing in some drinks!Bonus for getting free untradeable items for Borderlands 2 and TF2. Oh sorry did you say something? Couldn't hear you over my cards sucking! This game is rigged AF! :DHEYOOO/10 would listen to Claptrap tell Steve to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up again!			"

												I missed the functionality of being able to skip the characters’ dialogues by clicking with the right button, which the first game had. After a while the dialogues start to become repetitive and it's really annoying having to listen to them over and over again. The bet-sliding bar is also less responsive than in the first game. But it's still a great game nonetheless, and thank God it doesn't have the luck-related achievements the first one had, which makes 100%'ing this one more doable. It does have an annoying achievement to reach a balance of one million dollars though, but it's easy to exploit: if you close the game as soon as you're about to lose and re-open it, your balance will never go down, making it possible to reach the milestone very easily.

												First of all: I know this game was made to cash in on children that only want TF2 items. That said, here are the reasons why the devs should be ashamed of releasing this:-The strategies of the AI make no sense: When they bet or raise it's always a couple times the pot size, they call all ins with really crappy cards, they fall for standard poker tactics, etc.-When you play like an actual sane person would do, the portal robot is all over your face saying that you suck. Every single time. When you make a standard bet, the other players say that you suck.-To win those TF2 and borderlands 2 items, you have to complete challenges. But most 'challenges' ENCOURAGE you to play really bad. Example: win a showdown with 2 players. In a 5 player tourney, right.-The animations are borky-The conversations get really boring and repetitive. The one that annoys me the most is the blonde guy making an all in move.-The design of some card decks give me the creeps. What genius thought of a card deck where you have to stare 5 seconds to every card to discover which cards you actually have?-There is only 1 word to describe the design of the menu: tedious.Luckily, there are some good things about the game as well:-The conversations are well written in general. Sometimes they make you feel like the players are just casually folding or calling. Surprisingly, the claptrap conversations are the funniest. After an hour of playing they get repetitive though.-On rare occasions there are hands where the AI isn't completely dumb.Buy it for €1 if you want the items. If you're looking for a poker game: don't.			"

												Kickass game with awesome commentary by Brock Samson (Venture Bros.), Claptrap (Borderlands  2), Ash Williams (The Evil Dead), and Sam (Sam & Max), with dealer GLaDOS (Portal). Play either Texas Hold 'Em or Omaha style cards for a good time that is worth the cost!I will say that if you are a hardcore poker player, do not buy this game expecting cutting edge card cutting gameplay. The Poker Night series mainly focuses on the atmosphere and dialog by your fellow card players, allowing us to enjoy some inter-universe chit-chat among some of our favored game characters. I can't wait for Poker Night 3!			"

												Anyone that has any experience playing poker online will recognize the clunkiness of the betting system, a system that remains unchanged from Poker Night 1. There's Omaha now, which is nice, I suppose, and the unlocks are less random, which means that you'll be able to more easily get to the unlock that you want.But that's why you're playing it, aren't you? I can't imagine many people playing this game for the actual enjoyment of it. Honestly, why would you? With the aforementioned betting system, coupled with the complete randomness of your opponents' play, finding this fun is something that's just beyond me. There is some minor amusement to be gained from the conversations, but that doesn't last very long, first because of the terrible writing and second because of how little there is relative to the amount of time required to unlock all the items. By the time you've got all the bounties, you've heard them all at least a few times over.Bottom line: Buy this on sale, unlock the items you want, and then uninstall. This game just isn't worth your time to try to play it for fun.			"

It's better than the first game in nearly every way, but the critical option to turn down dialogue frequency has been removed.

												Poker Night 2 is the successor to Poker Night at the Inventory. It is similar to Portal 1 and 2, in the respect that the first game was an experiment, to ""test the waters"" to see how many people would want this game. By right, Portal 2 should've been one and Portal 1 should've been beta, or atleast a prequel. After all, Portal 1 was only the test subject.The selling point of the game and what it's most known for is its cross-universe character interaction. How would Sam react when Ash goes all-in? How would Brock  feel under the control of GLaDos? This is the best  feature, and it is very well-done. In the first game it was only characters that were licensed to Valve and Telltale, but now it includes a lot of new  faces and some that people may excite themselves over. The cross-promotional items are another reason why you should get this game too, I guess.Pros and Cons:+Some dialogue are pretty funny (the first time)+Includes a new game, 'Omaha' as well as Texas Hold 'em+Dat suspenseful card reveal+Quirky personalities+I just think that what the game gets right, it gets it perfectly, but the things it doesn't quite acheive, fails-Claptrap-The dialogue may be the best you've ever heard, but it keeps repeating and some actually stops the game just to play it out. Nice watching it for the first time, not so much at your 5th.-I don't know, but I feel that the dialogue has much less lines that the first game.-When they are bluffing, they bluff to the point where they actually go all-in. If you try to bluff, they call even when they have crappy cards. I think it's much harder to bluff them into folding, unlike the first game.-Claptrap (again)Really good game, better than the first. 7/10 for me "

												So, I originally bought this for iOS, thinking it would be ok for the $5 price tag it had. I came away from my first round of poker thinking, ""this is one of the best telltale games I have played in years. The gameplay is simple poker, Texas Hold'em and Omaha. nothing special, just the basic game. The real draw for players to buy this is the interactions between the characters during the games. Each character has many lines of dialogue, almost all of which are great, and they poke fun at  Gearbox studios, TellTale and many TV/Film personalites. GladOs is a great card dealer, and always adds a cynical or homicidal quote after most hands. The visuals are great, the character animation sare clean and smooth, far better than the first Poker Night, and The only drawback to the entire game is that the game might have done better had they included a few more crazy animations when characters are removed from the table.All in All, a absolute treat and perfect for a few hours of addictive and cynical fun. If you like TellTale, poker, Borderlands or TF2, this is the game for you. And if you don't like any of the above, buy it anyway. Cheers!			"

Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: A fun game that expands upon the original by including an additional play mode - Omaha style poker. In addition, the AI system has be revamped and over all this game is much more difficult than it's predecessor.  The unlock system has also been improved, both for in game items like tables, cards, and chips, as well as the cross promotional items that you'll get for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. There are some flaws here though, particularly a fringe case in the item unlock system that will make you want to break something, and an AI that seems to get far too lucky on the final card. Still, not a bad game to pick up and play in 20-30 minute increments.The amount of time you can get out of this one varies based on how good/lucky you are, and just what it is you expect to get out of the game. I put in 15 hours or so to get everything in game and all but one achievement, which I could probably have in the next hour or so. I've rated it a 7/10, and recommend picking it up at $2.50, though I have seen it as low as $0.99.			"

												This game features Brock Samson, Claptrap, Sam, and Ash. In this game, you play pokers with these characters, and the more you play the more stuff you unlock, and the more fun you have. To be honest, I only bought this for items, but upon playing it more, I had a lot of fun playing poker with some amazing characters with great personalites. I recommend this game, and hope for more updates in the future. Only thing missing is Online, other than that 10/10			"

Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: A fun game that expands upon the original by including an additional play mode - Omaha style poker. In addition, the AI system has be revamped and over all this game is much more difficult than it's predecessor.  The unlock system has also been improved, both for in game items like tables, cards, and chips, as well as the cross promotional items that you'll get for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. There are some flaws here though, particularly a fringe case in the item unlock system that will make you want to break something, and an AI that seems to get far too lucky on the final card. Still, not a bad game to pick up and play in 20-30 minute increments.The amount of time you can get out of this one varies based on how good/lucky you are, and just what it is you expect to get out of the game. I put in 15 hours or so to get everything in game and all but one achievement, which I could probably have in the next hour or so. I've rated it a 7/10, and recommend picking it up at $2.50, though I have seen it as low as $0.99.			"

												Poker Night 2 is the successor to Poker Night at the Inventory. It is similar to Portal 1 and 2, in the respect that the first game was an experiment, to ""test the waters"" to see how many people would want this game. By right, Portal 2 should've been one and Portal 1 should've been beta, or atleast a prequel. After all, Portal 1 was only the test subject.The selling point of the game and what it's most known for is its cross-universe character interaction. How would Sam react when Ash goes all-in? How would Brock  feel under the control of GLaDos? This is the best  feature, and it is very well-done. In the first game it was only characters that were licensed to Valve and Telltale, but now it includes a lot of new  faces and some that people may excite themselves over. The cross-promotional items are another reason why you should get this game too, I guess.Pros and Cons:+Some dialogue are pretty funny (the first time)+Includes a new game, 'Omaha' as well as Texas Hold 'em+Dat suspenseful card reveal+Quirky personalities+I just think that what the game gets right, it gets it perfectly, but the things it doesn't quite acheive, fails-Claptrap-The dialogue may be the best you've ever heard, but it keeps repeating and some actually stops the game just to play it out. Nice watching it for the first time, not so much at your 5th.-I don't know, but I feel that the dialogue has much less lines that the first game.-When they are bluffing, they bluff to the point where they actually go all-in. If you try to bluff, they call even when they have crappy cards. I think it's much harder to bluff them into folding, unlike the first game.-Claptrap (again)Really good game, better than the first. 7/10 for me "

												Telltale still doesn't seem to ♥♥♥♥ing understand how a deck of cards works. CARDS DO NOT HAVE DUPLICATES IN A DECK. Otherwise they did a solid job, even despite the huge middle finger to PC (O gaming industry, y u do this so much) release job. All the characters are alright this time around, though they insult you a tad much for my taste. While with the first game, say, Tycho would go 'Those cards will do!' in response to me winning a hand. While in this game everyone is mute and only criticizes you. The group definetly doesn't seem as friendly this time around, though the characters interactions are handled much better. Also Omaha FTW <3. As a poker game, this fails horribley.

												First of all: I know this game was made to cash in on children that only want TF2 items. That said, here are the reasons why the devs should be ashamed of releasing this:-The strategies of the AI make no sense: When they bet or raise it's always a couple times the pot size, they call all ins with really crappy cards, they fall for standard poker tactics, etc.-When you play like an actual sane person would do, the portal robot is all over your face saying that you suck. Every single time. When you make a standard bet, the other players say that you suck.-To win those TF2 and borderlands 2 items, you have to complete challenges. But most 'challenges' ENCOURAGE you to play really bad. Example: win a showdown with 2 players. In a 5 player tourney, right.-The animations are borky-The conversations get really boring and repetitive. The one that annoys me the most is the blonde guy making an all in move.-The design of some card decks give me the creeps. What genius thought of a card deck where you have to stare 5 seconds to every card to discover which cards you actually have?-There is only 1 word to describe the design of the menu: tedious.Luckily, there are some good things about the game as well:-The conversations are well written in general. Sometimes they make you feel like the players are just casually folding or calling. Surprisingly, the claptrap conversations are the funniest. After an hour of playing they get repetitive though.-On rare occasions there are hands where the AI isn't completely dumb.Buy it for €1 if you want the items. If you're looking for a poker game: don't.			"

												Anyone that has any experience playing poker online will recognize the clunkiness of the betting system, a system that remains unchanged from Poker Night 1. There's Omaha now, which is nice, I suppose, and the unlocks are less random, which means that you'll be able to more easily get to the unlock that you want.But that's why you're playing it, aren't you? I can't imagine many people playing this game for the actual enjoyment of it. Honestly, why would you? With the aforementioned betting system, coupled with the complete randomness of your opponents' play, finding this fun is something that's just beyond me. There is some minor amusement to be gained from the conversations, but that doesn't last very long, first because of the terrible writing and second because of how little there is relative to the amount of time required to unlock all the items. By the time you've got all the bounties, you've heard them all at least a few times over.Bottom line: Buy this on sale, unlock the items you want, and then uninstall. This game just isn't worth your time to try to play it for fun.			"

												Kickass game with awesome commentary by Brock Samson (Venture Bros.), Claptrap (Borderlands  2), Ash Williams (The Evil Dead), and Sam (Sam & Max), with dealer GLaDOS (Portal). Play either Texas Hold 'Em or Omaha style cards for a good time that is worth the cost!I will say that if you are a hardcore poker player, do not buy this game expecting cutting edge card cutting gameplay. The Poker Night series mainly focuses on the atmosphere and dialog by your fellow card players, allowing us to enjoy some inter-universe chit-chat among some of our favored game characters.

												Poker Night 2 is an improvement on Poker Night at the Inventory and it adds so much content that you'll be hopping around your room squeeing with joy. I love this title and I know that I could easily hop back into it to play poker with some really amazing and hilarious characters. It has wit, humour, visuals and plenty of great moments. The unlocks are fantastic, the gameplay gets you hooked and most of all it's the conversations and unique 'themed' poker rooms that get me wanting to play it more and more in order to hear what all the characters talk about. And even better, the game is under £5. Why don't you just stop reading this and buy the game already. You will love it. Trust me. It's amazing.

												I liked Poker Night 2's bounty system, and the banter is always good, but this actually felt like a step backward from the first game. Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.And the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.So at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.

												So, Poker Night 2, the follow-up game from the Poker Night at the Inventory, featuring new characters, new dialogue, new atmosphere, new, almost everything. Question is, did it succeed in what it did like it did in the first one?Let's start with the story: it's simple (yet again), beginning with the Inventory, a secret poker place for people to play Poker together for high stakes (this time for $20k instead of $10k).You play as The Player, who is presumably the same person you play as in the first Poker Night game, who is yet again, the silent and never-talking one, yet recognized still and warmly welcomed as you arrive from your limo to The Inventory.That is essentially the story in a nutshell: it's simple, it's true to the nature of Poker Night, and it's just a little more fun than the first one, I feel.Now onto the aspects of the game:
Game AspectScoreSide Notes
Graphics10/10 The game looks much more polished and vibrant than the first, and the characters still look true to their nature
Dialogue 4/10 The character's speeches was very specific and not improved at all from the first game, in fact having maybe 5 minutes worth 
Soundtrack 7.6/10 The soundtrack isn't as fitting as the first game's soundtrack, but it's still awesome as hell nonetheless 
Gameplay (differences) 10/10 I love the improvements made upon this game's gameplay: ordering drinks for people, the idea of Bounty Challenges, earning coins for winning tournaments to spend on felts, chips, and card changes, and the game winning is as satsifying as the first game 
AI 10/10 Much like the first one, this game's ai is believable, and even occassionally bluffs its way through the game 
Atmosphere 3/10 Between the dialogue and the character picks, I just can't imagine actually sitting down at a poker table playing Texas Hold'em with these characters: they're just, too diverse in personality 
Overall Score 7/10 This game's score tanked because of its overall atmosphere that it delivers; it delivers the feel that you need to win, or else be judged from these characters 
Side Notes If you're in it for the tf2/Borderlands2 items, and don't mind the atmosphere, then by all means it's worth the $5: if you're looking for a good poker game, though, I'd just stick with the first game

												TL;DR : Plain mo**er**cking awesome. Come on, it's GLaDOS and Cl4P-TR4PI love this game, I used to be a noob in IRL poker but I got better with playing this game.Yeah I first bought this for the free items for BL2 and TF2, and this was also on sale, so all great stuff.In my opinion, the AI is good. Well it isn't perfect, of course, but it's not too challenging nor too easy, and although people say this is 'rigged', I think it's just plain luck. Winning a 20000 bet with Ace high or a Straight Flush is so magnificent to the Max. The characters, as you see, are great, including GLaDOS. Well, tbh you need to be open-minded and accept jokes coming to you as humour and not insult, because what they comment are overly amusing. Yes, it does get repetitive at times, but the fact that the game keeps running on background (they do checks and raises and all that stuff while the convo goes, and you can too) so if a dialogue is repeating, you can 'skip' it in your head. I'd say 10/10, better than it's prequel. Oh, and with the virtual Inventory Tokens, you can also buy your opponents drinks, and make them make more hints or their cards.			"

												Depending on what you're looking for and expecting, Poker Night 2 will amuse you, frustrate you, or bore you. I am comparing Poker Night 2 to several other games I've played, including DD Poker 3, Dogs Playing Poker, the free Yahoo poker game, and Governor of Poker. First the good. Character animations. Poker Night 2 is the best of the bunch, since DD Poker and the yahoo game have no player animations, Governer of Poker has 2D animation consisting of the player's hat and hands only, and Dogs Playing Poker is quite old and low res. But best among a terribly weak field is not much of an achievement.Dialog. Funny once. Unfortunately it quickly runs out and you start hearing repeats. Over and Over. With no way to turn it off.  And appreciation of the humor depends on picking up the various game culture references. I loved Portal and Portal 2, so GladOS as a dealer works for me. I never played any of the Borderlands stuff, or Ace Ventura, so those references pass me by.And the badTournament structure. You start with $20,000, the big blind is initially $800, and it goes up in $400 increments pretty rapidly. So it's no limit, and you're starting off with just 25 big blinds. Suppose your first hand is pretty good, and you get a good flop. You'd typically bet before the flop, and make at least continuation bets after the flop and on the turn. Well if you do, and one of the other players doesn't fold, you're going to be all-in by the river. Its not uncommon to see all-in's on the first hand, whether you play it or not. So the structure of the tournament means the game is over pretty quickly. You won't spend even an hour patiently and slowing grinding down your opponents in this tournament structure. No matter how solidly you play, you're on thin ice from the start due to only having 25 big blinds -- a level at which some players are already looking for their last-stand hand. Poker AI. The four opponents do have distinct personalities and play styles. Sam plays fairly solidly. ClapTrap is random enough to be difficult to predict. Brock is aggresive, and Ash is a maniac. And what a maniac. As in ten-seven off suit all in before the flop kind of maniac. On the first hand, just because one player raised and another one called ahead of him.And this brings me to the biggest controversy about this game. Quite a few people have accused it of cheating. And the accusers seem to be the more serious poker players, not just whiners. The developers have denied this, and claimed that writing a game that cheats would be harder than writing one that doesn't. I don't believe that. I'm a professional programmer, with nearly 30 years of industry experience, though not in games. What I think is that writing a bad AI is easy, writing a good one that can beat good players consistently is very very hard. It's a lot easier to cheat.Let me explain why I think they'd be motivated to do this, other than because it's easier. Have you ever watched poker on TV? You do realize that it's edited, right? The boring hands are almost all edited out. They don't show you the hand where one player raises before the flop and everyone else folds. It's not entertaining. They show you the big confrontations, the sweats and especially the outrageous bad beats.So if you wanted to make a non-serous poker game that's fun, you'd do the same thing. And that's what I think Poker Night 2 has done. Because comparing playing it versus the other poker games Poker Night 2 deals many more bad beats. Many many more. It works both ways, as a player you get to apply bad beats as often as you receive them. This is not cheating to make you lose, it's cheating to make the game more exciting. Because lets face it, poker for play money isn't all that exciting by itself. Poker night 2 deals many more flushes, straights and full houses than I think you'd see from an honest dealer. Because my dry ace beats your dry ace isn't as exciting as my full house beats your flush. Or your flush beats my straight. I can't prove this, of course. I suppose I could write a bot that played the game and leave it running for a week and record the hand distribution, but that still wouldn't satisfy some. And what's the point. It's supposed to be a fun game, anyway. The game even hints at this. After raking in your chips, Sam will tell you ""You didn't stand a chance once I decided to win"". And GladOS, after you win a head, may say ""Now lets see how you do when I'm not stacking the deck in your favor"". If nothing else, these kind of lines are why the developers shouldn't be surprised if someone thinks the deals are set up. I think this ""game design"" philosophy is also why the blinds are structured the way they are, to get the excitment going quickly, and keep the game short. So on that level, I think the game succeeds. If you like having plenty of chances to win and lose big, quickly, without having to grind through a ton of boring hands first, then this game is far less boring than an honest game like DD Poker 3. It's cartoon poker, for the impatient kid in you.So after a mostly negative review I have given this game a 'yes', but it's really provisional: it depends on what you're looking for. As a serious poker game I can't recommend it. But who looking to buy this  really expects it to be a serious poker game? If you want serious poker, I recommend DD Poker 3 -- it's a free download. On the other hand, if entertainment means lots of crazy hands and few boring ones, with a cartoon backdrop, then this game is going to entertain you. And I think the deck-stacking is very well done -- you have to play quite a while and switch back and forth between it and other poker games before you feel certain the hands here are crazier in general.A couple additional notes: Poker Night 2 also can play Omaha. Omaha is also no limit, with the same blind structure as the Texas game. That added a little value for me, because I didn't have an Omaha game. And if anything, the Omaha game is even more conducive to crazy hands. Second note: the dealer isn't the only one that can cheat. You can search the web for the tells that the game regularly gives you. Just in case you weren't born with the inate ability to read poker tells off of an animated dog.			"

												I have to believe there are better poker games out there, though for how cheap it was I guess I can't complain too much.  But I will anyway.I just want to take the developers by their shoulders and shake them violently until they come to their senses.  The simplest changes would improve it dramatically.  As it is, the canned diologue gets stale fast.  I turned it off after a couple games, but now I have to watch them miming their lines.  That's right - you can't skip the incessant dialogue.  It turns fifteen minute games into thirty minute games.  It turns thirty minute games into purgatory.  Then there's the menu - even the *menu screens* take forever.  There's like a four second delay to move between them.  And when you press escape, it likes to default not to the actual menu, but to the unlocks screen.  Why?  Because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why.  I can only recommend this game to Buddhist monks for whom limitless patience is a possibility.  But if you find it for $2 then, meh, it can mix up your game library when other games get stale and you forget how much of your time Poker Night 2 loves wasting.  But don't worry.  It'll remind you how agonizingly time-wasting it is all over again, and you'll wind up writing a review to vent your frustrations.			"

												It sucks that Steam uses a Recommend/Not Recommend system, becaues this is actually about to be an in-depth look at the game, and readers are probably going to assume I just think anyone should play it because I decided to recommend it.But, since no one likes the guy who presses the thumbs down, I'm going to try as hard as I can to let you, the reader, know what you're getting. Because Poker Night 2 isn't for everyone. But, you may very well be that person, and this reviewer says, you most likely are.I'd go really overly-in-depth, because it's my preferred critical style, but Steam has a text limit I'm wasting...with a superfluous sentence, anyways, here's what you really need to know about Poker Night 2. (Spoiler alert: It's really not that much, just a few things.)1: It is absolutely sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory, and it has changed a lot of things.Now, the game presents the really cool new changes in an interesting and cool way, so I'll put this part in a spoiler. Don't worry, it's not some kind of big story-driven game, I just respect the way that they knew people would come from the first Poker Night expecting the same thing, and they have a fun way of introducing the new stuff. As a gamer, I implore you to skip this if you care about Poker Night as an experience, but encourage you to read it if you're trying to be careful about your money. Change A: $20,000 buy-ins starting with 400 - 800 blinds.The game no longer limits you to a puny $10,000 with starting blinds of 200 - 400. All the virtual preliminaries have been multiplied by x2. Little thing, but I think it was a great idea. It makes everything feel that much more valuable and, literally, high stakes.Change B: Inventory tokens.Your proficiency is rewarded with tokens. The tokens can be used to buy new chips, decks, and felts, as well as to buy drinks for each character, making them infinitely usable. Buying drinks for other players increases the amount and clarity of their tells, or for non-experienced poker players or the layman, it makes the characters tipsy and makes them unable to keep a focused poker face. A pokused facer foke. A hocus pocus trace.Sorry.And, like I said, they are used as currency towards getting new chips, decks, and felts. Like the first game, each of them are based off of the 5 new characters, and in order of how much their sets cost: Borderlands, Sam & Max, Venture Bros., Army of Darkness, and Portal. That's 15 things to buy. And, the felts now change the look of the inventory, as well as character appearances, and tons of new dialogue for having different felts and combining the chips, decks, and felts of a single canon.The amount of tokens you get are as follows:5th place - 04th place - 103rd place - 202nd place - 501st place - 100The cheapest item is the Borderlands chipset for 20 tokens, and the most expensive is the Portal felt for 480. Buying drinks also costs 5 tokens per character.So, that pretty much covers tokens.Change C: No dialogue options.Other than subtitles and a mute option, you're stuck watching/listening to the animations and dialogue of each character, even if that slows down/gets in the way of gameplay. I'll talk more about that later.Change D: Bounty ChallengesAgain, I'll talk about this one later, but I'm sure many of you desire Poker Night's TF2 and/or Borderlands items, and they're not the same as the first time around. Read more, because things have changed, and you'll want to hear about it, trust me.So, moving on.2: Don't buy it if you know you don't like poker games.Unless you're one of those people playing for the items, in which case I direct you to skip this and go directly to #3. Otherwise, if you're thinking about buying this game for any other reason, make sure you're anywhere above a hater of poker if you want it. If you've never dealt a hand in your life, or you like/are experienced in the dealing, I give this game a seal of absolute approval. The AI is designed not to give you a realistic feeling of the psychology of poker, but rather the video game alternative. Experienced poker players and ignorants like me before I played the first Poker Night will have fun learning how each character tells, plays, and values their gut over their mind. It is a great game for learning how to play poker, and on its own right as a fun game to figure out how to be good at. Looking at card games as a gamer is like looking at the cavemen figure out how to match star patterns as a scientist: humble beginnings, and fun. You can play Texas Hold 'Em or its alternate, Omaha Hold 'Em. *Important note for noobs, poker itself is not a card game, but an array of card games played similarly with changing rules depending on the name of the game. Texas and Omaha Hold 'Em are the two variants you play in Poker Night 2.Both games are extremely similar and friendly to newcomers, and the game includes a tutorial on the game accessible at any time, as well as a cheat sheet which shows the differnt kinds of hands and the hierarchy of their value. And for the pros, you'll find that the experience of having AI in the place of human combatants isn't entirely jarring, and fun in its own right thanks to their good design and fun personalities.So, if you absolutely know for a fact that you cannot stand Poker by all means testable, stay far, far, far away from Poker Night 2. It is practically nothing BUT virtual high-stakes poker.But, for everyone else, hop right in. That is, except for...3: The poor, poor item junkies that buy this game to get the items.You guys are in for a real crapshoot. Unlike the 1st game, you can't just start a new game over and over until you get the chance to knock one guy out for the item. It's MUCH harder this time around. You are assigned 3 random ""Bounty Challenges"", that you must complete before you can get a chance at getting the item. But, if you want a specific item, lucky for you, because you can actually just start a new tournament over and over until the character puts up the item you want, and you can try over and over forever. Sound nice right?Well, unfortunately, it can't be that simple.First of all, the Portal item can only be acquired after collecting all the bounty items. Trust me, it's a headache. Because the challenges couldn't be simple things like ""Win a tournament"" or ""Buy drinks for everyone.""There are those options, and thank god there are. You can expect to get 3 levels of difficulty from the random challenges: ""Easy gimmes, Hard, Extremely Improbable"".You might end up with the ""Come in Fourth place"" or ""Buy everyone drinks"" challenge, but expect it to come with: ""Steal a hand on the turn"" and ""Win with only a high card.""It may not sound too hard now, but trust me: The 24 hours of gameplay I currently have at the time of writing this review has been done SOLELY to get those items. I am currently on the Portal bounty item. I spent all of my free time just yesterday, as well as 3 hours this morning, ONLY, I repeat, ONLY on a SINGLE challenge: Win a hand with just a high card.For you item-seekers, trust me: this is going to be a very. Very. Very. Very. Very. Bueller. ...hard experience.If I could get back all the time I wasted getting those items, I would. It doesn't feel worth it at all.If you've got a lot of time with nothing productive or of superceding responsilbility to do, and you've got enough patience to justify literally days of being insulted by computers, then I leave it up to you to assume the green light. Otherwise, I advise you to do the right thing and go outside instead.Anyways, I've reached the text limit, so here's my final statement:I definitely recommend Poker Night 2 for everyone except item-seekers and poker-haters.

												Depending on what you're looking for and expecting, Poker Night 2 will amuse you, frustrate you, or bore you. I am comparing Poker Night 2 to several other games I've played, including DD Poker 3, Dogs Playing Poker, the free Yahoo poker game, and Governor of Poker. First the good. Character animations. Poker Night 2 is the best of the bunch, since DD Poker and the yahoo game have no player animations, Governer of Poker has 2D animation consisting of the player's hat and hands only, and Dogs Playing Poker is quite old and low res. But best among a terribly weak field is not much of an achievement.Dialog. Funny once. Unfortunately it quickly runs out and you start hearing repeats. Over and Over. With no way to turn it off.  And appreciation of the humor depends on picking up the various game culture references. I loved Portal and Portal 2, so GladOS as a dealer works for me. I never played any of the Borderlands stuff, or Ace Ventura, so those references pass me by.And the badTournament structure. You start with $20,000, the big blind is initially $800, and it goes up in $400 increments pretty rapidly. So it's no limit, and you're starting off with just 25 big blinds. Suppose your first hand is pretty good, and you get a good flop. You'd typically bet before the flop, and make at least continuation bets after the flop and on the turn. Well if you do, and one of the other players doesn't fold, you're going to be all-in by the river. Its not uncommon to see all-in's on the first hand, whether you play it or not. So the structure of the tournament means the game is over pretty quickly. You won't spend even an hour patiently and slowing grinding down your opponents in this tournament structure. No matter how solidly you play, you're on thin ice from the start due to only having 25 big blinds -- a level at which some players are already looking for their last-stand hand. Poker AI. The four opponents do have distinct personalities and play styles. Sam plays fairly solidly. ClapTrap is random enough to be difficult to predict. Brock is aggresive, and Ash is a maniac. And what a maniac. As in ten-seven off suit all in before the flop kind of maniac. On the first hand, just because one player raised and another one called ahead of him.And this brings me to the biggest controversy about this game. Quite a few people have accused it of cheating. And the accusers seem to be the more serious poker players, not just whiners. The developers have denied this, and claimed that writing a game that cheats would be harder than writing one that doesn't. I don't believe that. I'm a professional programmer, with nearly 30 years of industry experience, though not in games. What I think is that writing a bad AI is easy, writing a good one that can beat good players consistently is very very hard. It's a lot easier to cheat.Let me explain why I think they'd be motivated to do this, other than because it's easier. Have you ever watched poker on TV? You do realize that it's edited, right?

Because lets face it, poker for play money isn't all that exciting by itself. Poker night 2 deals many more flushes, straights and full houses than I think you'd see from an honest dealer. Because my dry ace beats your dry ace isn't as exciting as my full house beats your flush. Or your flush beats my straight. I can't prove this, of course. I suppose I could write a bot that played the game and leave it running for a week and record the hand distribution, but that still wouldn't satisfy some. And what's the point. It's supposed to be a fun game, anyway. The game even hints at this. After raking in your chips, Sam will tell you ""You didn't stand a chance once I decided to win"".

												I guess all there is to say about this is to heck with the poker part give me more Glados and Claptrap!!!!!!!! All in all this game is good; however, a little lack luster and the puns get used far to much. You will play for two hours and hear the same jokes after that. Definitely worth buying for at least the Borderlands 2 and TF2 items and skins. rating: 7/10			"

												Poker Night 2 is an improvement on Poker Night at the Inventory and it adds so much content that you'll be hopping around your room squeeing with joy. I love this title and I know that I could easily hop back into it to play poker with some really amazing and hilarious characters. It has wit, humour, visuals and plenty of great moments. The unlocks are fantastic, the gameplay gets you hooked and most of all it's the conversations and unique 'themed' poker rooms that get me wanting to play it more and more in order to hear what all the characters talk about. And even better, the game is under £5. Why don't you just stop reading this and buy the game already. You will love it. Trust me. It's amazing. And if you don't believe me then go watch my livestreams or other highlights! There's fun to be had!			"

												First of all: I know this game was made to cash in on children that only want TF2 items. That said, here are the reasons why the devs should be ashamed of releasing this:-The strategies of the AI make no sense: When they bet or raise it's always a couple times the pot size, they call all ins with really crappy cards, they fall for standard poker tactics, etc.-When you play like an actual sane person would do, the portal robot is all over your face saying that you suck. Every single time. When you make a standard bet, the other players say that you suck.-To win those TF2 and borderlands 2 items, you have to complete challenges. But most 'challenges' ENCOURAGE you to play really bad. Example: win a showdown with 2 players. In a 5 player tourney, right.-The animations are borky-The conversations get really boring and repetitive. The one that annoys me the most is the blonde guy making an all in move.-The design of some card decks give me the creeps. What genius thought of a card deck where you have to stare 5 seconds to every card to discover which cards you actually have?-There is only 1 word to describe the design of the menu: tedious.Luckily, there are some good things about the game as well:-The conversations are well written in general. Sometimes they make you feel like the players are just casually folding or calling. Surprisingly, the claptrap conversations are the funniest. After an hour of playing they get repetitive though.-On rare occasions there are hands where the AI isn't completely dumb.Buy it for €1 if you want the items. If you're looking for a poker game: don't.			"

												Poker Night 2 is an extremely offensive CoD rip-off, the bad things about it are:No teams, you're always playing Free-for-all.You can't choose what you're holding in your hand, it's completely random.Changing your decorations doesn't alter your gameplay or give you a tactical advantage on your opponents.Brock's a c*nt.Ash isn't really any better.CL4P-TP is an obnoxious down syndrome with the mental age of 2.I think Sam is okay, but he pisses me off by folding every single f**king hand.Also, another thing that annoys me about Sam is everytime someone goes all-in he shouts ""GOOD DAY IN THE MORNING."".

												I liked Poker Night 2's bounty system, and the banter is always good, but this actually felt like a step backward from the first game. Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.And the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.So at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.

												Five dollars doesn't usually get you much. This game TEARS DOWN that wall. Now, this game is NOT for everybody. It has a BUNCH of jokes, but at least 85% of them are at the expence of the player. Also, being a poker game, if you don't know how to play texas hold em', this game is not for you. Lastly, and this one is UNFORGIVABLE, no multiplayer. A poker game, WITHOUT MULTIPLAYER! (I'm gonna let that sink in for a second.) Still, this is a well made game.The AI is NOT like Mario Party's on hard/expert. (In other words, it's not 100% cheap and OP.) It's jokes are amazing! (If you're ok with videogame charactors making fun of you, that is.) And, well... FREEKING POKER! Also, TF2 and Borderlands 2 unlocks. 'Nough said. Now if this was 10 or 15 bucks, STAY AWAY!

												Poker Night 2 is the successor to Poker Night at the Inventory. It is similar to Portal 1 and 2, in the respect that the first game was an experiment, to ""test the waters"" to see how many people would want this game. By right, Portal 2 should've been one and Portal 1 should've been beta, or atleast a prequel. After all, Portal 1 was only the test subject.The selling point of the game and what it's most known for is its cross-universe character interaction. How would Sam react when Ash goes all-in? How would Brock  feel under the control of GLaDos? This is the best  feature, and it is very well-done. In the first game it was only characters that were licensed to Valve and Telltale, but now it includes a lot of new  faces and some that people may excite themselves over. The cross-promotional items are another reason why you should get this game too, I guess.Pros and Cons:+Some dialogue are pretty funny (the first time)+Includes a new game, 'Omaha' as well as Texas Hold 'em+Dat suspenseful card reveal+Quirky personalities+I just think that what the game gets right, it gets it perfectly, but the things it doesn't quite acheive, fails-Claptrap-The dialogue may be the best you've ever heard, but it keeps repeating and some actually stops the game just to play it out. Nice watching it for the first time, not so much at your 5th.-I don't know, but I feel that the dialogue has much less lines that the first game.-When they are bluffing, they bluff to the point where they actually go all-in. If you try to bluff, they call even when they have crappy cards. I think it's much harder to bluff them into folding, unlike the first game.-Claptrap (again)Really good game, better than the first. 7/10 for me "

Poker with who? Poker with your Favourite video game characters! You have Claptrap, from Borderlands, who is funny and makes the game humorous at all times.You have Ash Williams, from ""The Evil Dead"" franchise, who makes cunning remarks, of how great he is.You have Brock Samson, from Adult Swim, who likes to bet a whole ton of money every time.You have Sam, from the ""Sam & Max"" games, who likes to talk about his adventures, while you have your own poker ones.You have GlaDOS, from the ""Portal"" games, who narrates the Poker game, and talks about various ways to kill you...And you have the quiet Moxxie, from ""Borderlands"" who serves the drinks, to make ya'll drunk!This is a mix up of different styles, and the gameplay is amazing! I love Poker Night 2!When you win, you dont just have the satisfaction of winning, but you can get Money to help you make the place look like your favourite game, and you can win prizes for various games, Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2.I think this game is worth every little cent I payed for it. Its a truely spectacular game, and i'd buy a sequel if it came out!8.5/10Highly Recommended.			"

												Good Game, puts my ""Poker Skills"" in action. It brings a lot of joy and fustration, but usually my fustration get's cleared with all the side conversations that happen when you play. Not to mention that the characters that play with you are mostly Taletell favorites, Brock, Claptrap, Ash Williams, Sam, and GlaDOS. The bounty challenges are neat, once I complete a bounty challenge then get the prize, I go onto Borderlands 2 / Team Fortress 2 to look at the items (they're all humerous.) I 100% reccomend this game for everyone if you are a fan of Poker, because I absolutely love it.			"

												Poker Night 2 doesn't live up to its predecessor. Brock, Ash, and Sam are just too serious to make this a fun table to play at. Clap trap is the only character with some charisma. The players are slightly better skillwise than the first game, but easy to figure out after a few rounds. But overall, poker skills are very poor. Unfortunately the conversation doesn't make up for it in this one.The one shining aspect, for me at least, is that Omaha poker is included which is my favorite poker game.			"

												This game is now available for download only half an hour ago, but millions of people have received a variety of subjects and HATS! TellTale Games have made the game more fun and colorful. New characters: jock Brock, Detective Sam, Ash cyborg and another boltivy friend (Max also has a role to play in the viewer) Claptrape. I personally remember the first hour of play the introductory video and GLaDOS! And as Poker Night 2 and remained cheerful ""clone"" of his ancestor Poker Night at The Inventory! 9/10			"

												Quite an interesting way to play free poker. It really provides the entertainment people require.PROS1. Fun GamePlaying poker has never been so interesting. All the insance antics and the interesting conversations held by the characters. E.g. All the false information about dogs from Sam.I especially liked the themed sets. E.g. Steve from Borderlands 2 and his ""Heyoo""2. CharactersAll of them are so funny. I love Claptrap the most. I was hoping Moxxi would speak though.3. Probability CalculationsI appreciate showing the probability though I wish you would teach us how you arrive at the number.4. Crossover Game RewardsNice. Love the free skins for winning.CONS1. No Multiplayer ****Such a fun game and you can't play multiplayer. What a waste. I felt that Telltale could easily make themselves one of the top games on Steam by allowing for multiplayer. Perhaps they have some restrictions regarding publishing online gambling software but I would like to point out that Dota 2 already encourages gambling in the form of match predictions using CASH.2. Nothing to DistractWhile waiting for the NPCs to decide (which should be instant), maybe there could be something interesting to do in the few seconds in between.3. No Concrete Assurance That It's Not RiggedI don't see anything anywhere in the game that points out that it is not rigged. So far the best assurance I've come across is a forum post. The idea that the game is rigged to win at some points and lost at others takes away a certain portion of fun.SUGGESTIONS1. Assurance of Non-Rigging/CheatingMaybe you could have a small option in the Menu that points out how Telltale codes the game to be non-cheating. 2. MultiplayerYou could attract all the seniors in their retirement to Steam, thereby helping to make Steam a true company for all.3. Other Card GamesBridge, Taipan, Baccarat, Blackjack, Big 2 etc... The list is endless. Why stop at Poker? You could corner the market on non-cash card games on Steam. I AM HIGHLY AGAINST USING REAL MONEY TO BET ON STEAM GAMES. IF YOU DO MAKE A POKER NIGHT 3 WITH MULTIPLAYER, DO NOT ADD A REAL MONEY COMPONENT OR ALLOW PLAYERS TO MAKE REAL MONEY SIDE BETS.4. Newbie TutorialHave a simple section teaching how to calculate the probability of winning with your hand. This will teach advanced mathematics to MILLIONS of players. This would be optional as some people just hate math.5. Protect People from Cheating You could also teach them about the dark side of poker, like the cheating. This would help to protect the public from cheats in real life. E.g.""cooler decks"", palming cards, marking cards, false shuffles.Treat this like an act of charity.6. Gamer's CentralYou could create a Gamer's Central just like the one from Wreck-It Ralph. Then everyone can choose their card game and walk into an empty room.			"

Not Quite a Full HouseI write this review as a Texas Hold'em and general poker enthusiast.  I also write it as a fan of the characters and background in this game.  I've played a lot of hands of poker, and I've played/watched a lot of the pop culture source material that is included in this game.Poker Night 2 is a (DUH!) poker game that is pretty straightforward and uncomplicated.  Offering only two modes of play (Texas Hold'em and Omaha) and only two real end goals.  If you are a purist poker player, this game isn't for you.  However, if you enjoy poker and also like Army of Darkness, Portal, Sam & Max, Borderlands, or Venture Bros, then you will definitely like this game.Ante up if you... Are a casual poker player. Like to laugh. Are familiar with at least 3/5 of the pop culture references in this game.Fold on this game if you... Are looking for a pure poker challenge. Aren't familiar with the characters. Are familiar with the characters, but hate them.The Bottom LineThis is a half-decent poker game that is a complete barrel of laughs and in-jokes....  But ONLY if you are familiar with the references beforehand.  If you aren't, there really isn't much here for you other than Borderlands 2 and TF2 unlocks.There is also the repetive factor...  Some of the lines and jokes are just absolutely hilarious, but only the first dozen times.  Although I found myself discovering new lines/segments in the end game (to my delight!), most of the content is recycled over and over again and it loses it's edge.Also, I enjoyed the fact that Mad Moxxi was present, but other than the brief eyecandy she loses her appeal because she was not given any dialog what-so-ever and ends up being a throw-away to be honest.  On that note, the table is pretty much a sausage-fest and I would have really liked to see Moxxi as a competitor rather than relegated to a completely mute bartender.As far as the actual poker playing goes...  It's pretty standard.  You eventually learn the tells of your opponents and leverage that to boost your winning average until you inevitably unlock all the neat content (custom tables, chips, cards, etc) and bounty rewards.  Beyond that though, there isn't a lot to offer hardcore poker champs.I ended up really having fun with this game, and getting a massive kick out of the in-jokes layered throughout.  I am hoping that there will be a Poker Night 3, and that it brings a little more to the table in terms of competive poker playing and personality.  In the meantime, PN2 is good fun for fans of the characters.			"

												One of the best poker games on pc, if not best. Filled with Telltale characters, awesome humor and free stuff for Borderlands/TF. Dialogs between characters are priceless, the only bad — after a while they repeats a lot and you cannot skip them.Get it now.			"

												As with the first game, the player's enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend on how familiar they are with the characters. As a fan of Borderlands and Portal, I found Claptrap and Glados to be very funny. The other characters aren't important to me, so I found them quite dull, although Ash did make me laugh a couple of times with references to Bruce Campbell's Burn Notice character. There are plenty of unlockable items to give the game some longevity, but the downside is the characters don't have enough lines, so they repeat themselves often. There are two variations of Poker, Texas and Omaha, and a much better explanation of the rules than the first game, so poker novices won't be totally confused. I'm sure there are better poker games around, but considering the purchase price, I feel like I've got value for money.			"

												I love the unique content that is unlockable in this game for Team Fortress 2, no other games around can do that. The dialogue is funny and witty, I still hear things I haven't before after twenty tournaments. This game would be even better with multi-player, let players select one of the normal NPCs to play then slim down the dialog set for each character. At least a good idea if a third installment is made to the series or if this game was ever updated. Even basic skipping abilities for normal dialogue would be great. It feels like it slows the games down after a few in a row. Plays fine at the native resolution on my Intel HD 3000 chipset meaning it can run on most laptops. Totally great game, a must own in for your Valve collection. 8.5/10			"

												Those are some high quality promo items.  Grand game.  ...But in all seriousness, Poker Night 2 is a very entertaining poker excursion.  Before this game, I had no idea how poker functioned.  Now, when...or if...if I ever participate in an actual poker tournament, I highly expect witty banter from interesting characters, nostalgic yet distinguished jazz-like music and fascinating themes. Either that or I will be instantly disqualified and forced out.  It's the perfect education tool, it teaches all the world about the joys of poker!  Such as buying alcoholic drinks to slowly but surely sabotage other fictional players or using a cheat sheet.  If any sentient being is still alive after reading that, then good, now I can accurately assess my opinion of the game.  Really, Poker Night 2 is a simple ""video game"" at the end of the day.  After all, it is what it is, poker.  What makes it so entertaining are the characters and their conversations with one another.  Poker Night 2's cast of characters is comprised of several fictional video games, animated television series, and even film characters.  Though these celebrities are hardly the most obscure of competitors, I admit that I had little idea of a few of them.  However, the way they interact with one another manages to crack a smile on my face.  The act of Brock Samson, the deadly assassin bodyguard from the Venture Bros. snigger at a profile of Sam, the bipedal dog detective from Sam & Max is a humorous conversation to listen to while looking at one's deck of cards.  Same with the adventurous Ash Williams and the slightly annoying yet semi-endearing CL4P-TP robot talk about his life story or attempt to put the moves on the dealer, a female A.I. by the name of GLaDOS and instantly be dismissed is nice to listen to.  ...The first few times.  While the charm of the conversations can last for quite some time, if one plays this game for hours on end, they will inevitably listen to the same dialogue line they heard sometime an hour or two before.  There unfortunately is only so much variety in one playthrough.Luckily, the game does not rely on characters chatting your ears off to keep you playing.  Not only are their incentives like the promotional items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2, but the soundtrack is a pleasure to groove to in one's seat.  Songs like ""Still Alive"" are reprised in a smooth jazz version to fit the calm, calm mood of having one's virtual wallet face the equivalent of being suctioned in by a vacuum. Of course, that seems like a hefty toll.  Fret not, for your ears do not have to take on the entire burden.  For your dear optic nerves, there are several card and chip themes for your playing pleasure that can be used to customize your tournaments.  You can combine card themes, chip themes, and table felt themes of your favorite franchise (as is represented) like Portal.  Unlock the themes and deploy them and watch as your poker table is immersed in an Aperture Science simulation.  Alternatively, employ a Borderlands 2 theme set and get the gritty, casino feel or the Sam & Max themes and unlock a black and white detective mystery movie-esque setting, originally meant for Sam & Max's 25th anniversary.  However, at the very end of the day, Poker Night 2 is just that, a poker game.  A poker game featuring the stars of video games, a television show, and a movie series.  I recommend it, not just for its incentives, but for its fascinating, entertaining themes and dialogue around the poker table.  ...And because those promo items are really good looking.			"

												Fun just like the orignal, however these new TF2 items are now harder to earn, addtionally there are new charaters, sadly they don't live up to the orignal charaters.Pros:1. You can now give your opponent's drinks to make them easier to beat.2. Fun cameos.3. You can now earn Borderlands 2 items along with TF2 items.Cons:1. Items can be way too hard and tedious to get, thanks to some challenges.2. TF2 items are all boring cosmetics instead of a mix of reskin weapons, a badge and cool shades like in the orignal.Overall just as good as the orignal.			"

												The first one was kind of fun... this one is just appaling.... The first time you hear the dialogues it's okay and even funny at times but man, it all loops too quickly and as said in other reviews you can't skip them... Worst of the worst Glados as a dealer... really? And to make things worse, the game is much harder than the first one.. not necessarily a bad thing but when you have to suffer all those dialogues it really gets annoying. Just saying.. played about a hundred hands and only once I got a real good kicker... rest of the time even with a realtively good kicker the flop always kills it... Wanted to play more of this game but really it gets too annoying too quickly. Too bad as it is much better optimized than the first game and addition of omaha variant is a nice additionBesides, I miss the Heavy ;-) "

If you try to download Borderlands 2 items you have to write an email to Gearbox with a screenshot or you won't get them. To be honest, this game probably IS worth the money.

I hate annoying robot. I also hate max from the first game.Naturally you can get things from each dude for your favorite tf2 mercs if you win. They improved the prize system in that you gotta complete certain missions, and those missions unlock the right to have someone put forth an item if they still have one.Its still just poker...or texas hold-em.You can get a skull hat for pyro, a knife for heavy, a mask for spy, boots for scout, and a cartoon dog hat.the banter from each person is amusing, but the sassy robot always wins.poke-I mean Texas hold 'em/10			"

												Play poker with your favorite dudes you've never seen before until now.Dog, Sassy robot, violent human, other violent human, and super super super annoying robot from borderlands.I want to kill him by throwing cards at his metal body until he suffers all kinds of cuts. I hate annoying robot. I also hate max from the first game.Naturally you can get things from each dude for your favorite tf2 mercs if you win. They improved the prize system in that you gotta complete certain missions, and those missions unlock the right to have someone put forth an item if they still have one.Its still just poker...or texas hold-em.You can get a skull hat for pyro, a knife for heavy, a mask for spy, boots for scout, and a cartoon dog hat.the banter from each person is amusing, but the sassy robot always wins.poke-I mean Texas hold 'em/10			"

												Fun, worth it for the banter from the other players. Not really worth it if you are looking for a good poker game, as the other characters are mostly terrible, going all in all the time with nothing possibly coming out or betting aggressively before the flop raising and re-raising, and then checking until the river. Still for what you pay, it's a good buy.			"

												Thoroughly addictive. I thought it would be nice to try as its pretty cheap, (€2,49 at the time of writing this) and now I'm hooked! I really want to get all the achievements in this game. You win some, you lose some, but the commentary and banter between all of the players enhances the fun. If you own any/ have played any of these games, the humour is that bit more enjoyable. A big plus is that its not real money, I'm terrible now but I’ll get better eventually ^^!10/10			"

												I enjoyed this game far more than I expected.  The characters are a blast.  The only think I wish is that it would be possible to skip some of their dialogue with space bar.  Once you play enough some of their long stories get a bit old.  Still replay value is great.  The AI plays poker reasonably well.			"

												This, my friends, was a super fun game. It's actually currently a ""free"" offering on PSN as well. Wherever you play this though, you are in for a treat. You are the nameless, silent ""The Player"" and are playing against Brock Samson, Claptrap, Sam and Max, and Ash Williams. The dialogue is pretty witty and at times hilarious as the other players talk amongst themselves, have little jokes and jabs they throw your way, etc...the table is hosted by GLaDOS, who is also the dealer, and who interjects passive aggressive hostile jabs at all the players throughout the game. Actually, GLaDOS's dialogue is effective at representing the subtle menace for which it is known.There are a few options in the game that enhance the experience, most notably the ability to upgrade your chips, felt, and cards to the settings from all the other characters origin worlds/stories, which outside of changing the appearance of the room/table/et al, also unlockas new dialogue between the characters. You can also buy drinks for the other characters, delivered by your favorite bartender, Moxxi, in whose bar you are actually playing poker in. The drinks cause the other players to be more obvious in their tells.Speaking of tells, each of the players has them. Brock is a hothead and will often bet without a real hand. Ash plays more like Gus Hansen, Claptrap plays a solid game overall, and Sam almost always folds unless he has a real hand.That's pretty much it. Outside of the setting, dialogue, and some challenges which allow you to unlock new skins and such for Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2, it's pretty much a straightforward Hold 'em and Omaha game. So, if you like poker and video games, you will probably enjoy this. If not, look elsewhere for sure.			"

PresentationPoker Night 2 follows a familiar pattern that you have probably seen or at least heard of before, and much like the original title Poker Night at the Inventory, it puts you, The Player against four other characters from different blockbuster franchises not only from the video game industry, but also from television series and movies, in tournaments of Texas Hold'em or Omaha Hold'em. This time around your adversaries are Sam from the Sam & Max franchise, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, Ash Williams from The Evil Dead franchise, and Claptrap from the Borderlands series, in addition to GLaDOS from the Portal series which takes the role of the dealer. There isn't a story that unites those characters at the Inventory poker table, but having them in one place is great no matter the circumstances, and even though there is no adventure or story to follow here, hearing from them once again is just as nice. Even with the thought of the game being a simple poker simulator with your favourite characters as your adversaries in mind, the game does little to set itself apart from other such games apart from having those characters in it; there is only a short introduction cutscene when you start the game for the first time that shows you making your entrance at the Inventory for the first time and bumping into all those characters along the way as you move towards the table, and after that everything will become an endless repetition until you eventually get bored of the game. Even if you aren't familiar with some of the franchises that brought you those characters, they will make themselves known to you as you play more and more with them and hear their stories, but the really pleasure comes for those long-time fans of one of those characters, because hearing themselves explain one of their adventures that you are already familiar with in different way and in some ways making a parody of it is unlike nothing else.Rating: 7GameplayThere's no catch here, it's poker: you either dig it or you don't, but considering the amount of poker games out there, some of which come at no cost at all, looking at Poker Night 2's only 2 game modes and the lack of any sort of multiplayer you realize that if you got this game for the actual poker playing experience, you clearly got the wrong thing. Sure, Texas Hold'em and Omaha Hold'em are the most popular poker modes, but just like anything else it will get boring to follow the same road every tournament without any twist to change the actual game. Poker was always one of the most popular forms of gambling and even if virtual poker games still maintain that feeling by using virtual money and chips, it doesn't feel like gambling unless you play against other human players. Playing against the AI gets boring incredibly fast simply because their next move will always be predictable in a form or another, and even though the difficulty of the game is somewhere around what would be a normal level, you can't increase or decrease the difficulty to your liking if you're looking for a more intense experience or a more relaxed play. The only things that will change the boring atmosphere come in the form of unlockables, that once activated will change things like the deck of cards, the table or the chips and activating all three of them from the same theme will trigger a different scenery effect specific to that theme, making the Inventory look like the set of another Evil Dead movie or the next chamber of Portal experiments, but even so, those changes are strictly visual and will not affect the core idea of a repeating poker experience that is isolated to the AI battles only. Apart from the items that can be unlocked using tokens that you'll win at the end of each tournament according to what position you finished on and the ability to order drinks from the bar for your adversaries there is nothing else to distract you from what is an incredibly repetitive set of plays that is limited in every possible way.Rating: 5.5GraphicsPoker Night 2 isn't the prettiest game out there, even compared to other poker titles only, but it's not bad looking either; the characters are nicely done, the backgrounds are pretty and those unlockables really change the scenery in a pleasant way, especially when you combine all three of them from the same theme package. The animations are decent, even though the lip sync can be way off at times, but all the funky moves of those characters that combined with audio effects create some funny moments make up for it. Things don't look bad in any way, but you can clearly see some cubic edges when the camera zooms in on a character's face and so on.Rating: 6.5AudioThe cast, even though small, does its job of creating a rich audio environment as Sam is voiced by David Nowlin, Max by David Boat, Brock Samson by Patrick Warburton, Ash Williams by Danny Webber, Claptrap by David Eddings and GLaDOS by Ellen McLain. The one great thing about Poker Night 2 comes in the form of its epic dialogue between all those legendary characters that will constantly tell jokes and stories, all to the delight of the player. As good as those jokes are however, they won't last forever, and even thought the first hours of the game will be a pleasant surprise for the fans of those characters as you hear more and more stories about them, they will get repetitive eventually and when they do, that fun will almost instantly turn into boredom.Rating: 8ExtrasIf you're a fan of those characters or at least some of them, you'll have fun in the game for a few hours, but after you've heard everything there is to hear, which shouldn't take longer than 5 hours to do, your only motivation will come in the form of unlockables which in a worst case scenario will take around 10 hours to unlock all, and after that there really is no reason to come back: you'll hear the same old lines over and over again, there is nothing else to win or see and there are much better poker games out there available for free, which can also be played online.Rating: 4VerdictPoker Night 2 is a delight for those who appreciate the classics and wanna hear more about their favourite characters and this game is the perfect opportunity to see some of those legendary characters all in one place, but that special treatment will only last for a few hours, and once that is done and you've heard every joke those characters have in store for you, Poker Night 2 is just another game that you won't play ever again.Rating Overall: 6.2Check the full review and a lot more about Poker Night 2 at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=216 "

												*INITIAL IMPRESSIONS*It's pretty much Poker Night, but with new contestants, new gamemodes and challenges and a vastly improved unlock system as well as a better built enviroment that seems more lively than the previous game. It's still mostly just a $5 promotion with unlockable items for TF2 and Borderlands 2. The unlocks for those games are hardly worth the time because in TF2 almost everybody will have them in due time and people hardly play Borderlands 2 as often as they used to (even then nobody pays any attention at all to whatever their partners are wearing).In short: Whoop-de-freaking-doo			"

												Only get this game if you want the items that come with it. The Borderlands 2 ♥♥♥♥ is neglectable so you should only want it for TF2 items.Why is this game not the poker you game you should be buying? The cutscenes. They are annoying after a few games and you can not skip them. You might be able to turn them off (Haven't checked) but that would kill everything besides the poker element. Don't get me wrong, it would be a great game but everything feels clunky and the menu is horrible. To switch 2 pages in the menu you take about 8-10 seconds. Dreading, not majorly long, but still dreading.It has some fun features, decks / felts / chips can be customized to different sets that belong to the characters that sit at your table.In the end, if this game wasn't feeling so clunky. Had a skip button and slow overall I would recommend this to everyone. Because the poker is just poker. And that's mostly what you want from a poker game.			"

												I enjoy Poker, and the comedy is funny. I wouldn't recommend this game because it really isn't worth the $5. I frequently run into a bug in which my game progress is cleared. The game also has a bug in which the best hand you have isn't played, and I lose because of it. For instance, I'll have a full house in my hand, and the game autoselects only the three of a kind to use, while an opponent has a straight.			"

												While I do find this game amusing, and will probably continue to play it as a time waster, there's a few gnawing reasons behind this negative review.Starting out, I have to say that this is far from one of Telltale's best works.  The game honestly comes off as something they spent a weekend throwing together for a quick buck before they moved on to their next epic story.  It's poker, with some entertaining characters, and I realize that in itself has limits but this game had the potential to be a far better experience.Getting down to the nitty gritty of the whole thing, the biggest flaw in the game is sheer repetitiveness.  Within the first half hour of playing you’ll quickly notice characters often become repetitive with their expressions toward your actions.  I swear, if I have to hear Sam say, “Great day in the morning”, one more time I can’t be held liable for the consequences.  Not to mention how often Claptrap brings the game to a solid halt explaining how he’s immune to bluffing, right before folding.  It was funny the first time, but the 300th time is just annoying.  That’s the biggest thing here.  All of these expressions were meant to be funny or amusing, and they are the first time you see them, but then it’s like watching the same joke over and over again.  It stops being amusing and just becomes dreadfully annoying.The next least annoying feature of the game is, again, repetitiveness.  This time it takes the role of the introduction of each game.  Every time you start a new game a 3rd rate character announces the buy-in for the tournament at 20 thousand, the camera pans to show everyone putting meaningless and endless wads of money on the table, and after a short eternity you finally get to play cards.  This could have been completely left out, there’s no point to it.  Doesn’t matter how many times you play the game, everyone is still going to magically pull a stack of money out of their pocket and drop it on the table.  It’s not like a character is going to be $5 short, or reveal empty pockets, or something.  Everyone’s always got the money, so why waste time on meaningless “cut scenes”?  Going right along with that is the blind notification.  When GladoS comes in and talks about upping the blinds it seems really out of place.  It’s like felt they needed to make announcing a change in the rules enjoyable, but got the intern to do the job.Aside from poker there are some other draws to this game, the most important being the unlocks for other games.  Having accomplished a lot of these unlocks I can safely say, they’re really not worth it.  From what I can tell each character has a “special item” you can win, by winning the poker game while they have the item up for grabs.  That means there are only 4 special items, each of which unlocks a few things across the different games the characters come from.  Most of the unlocks are simply cosmetic, and won’t actually mean much to anyone.  There are a series of these, again simply cosmetic.  You win points for playing poker and completing “achievements” that are assigned to you at the start of the game, like defeating 2 opponents in a head-to-head match.  These points can be used to unlock different cosmetic styles for the poker table, chips, cards, etc.  The unlocks are themed after the various games the characters are from (portal included).  That said, once you find and unlock your favorites there really is no further use for the points.  I had a bunch of the unlocks done within the first 3 hours, which really left me not wanting to do any more.  All in all, and I really hate to do it, I have to give Poker Night 2 a thumbs down.  At best it’s a gimmicky way to play Omaha or Texas Holdem poker (those are the only two modes available).  I went in hoping for more, and maybe that’s what led me to being so disappointed with it.  I’ll probably still play it from time to time as a time waster, but it’s not a game I’m willing to recommend.			"

												       Out of all of the other poker games I have played, this one is one of the worst. I'm sorry to say but for me this poker game just screams computer automated. When I say this I mean to say that every round you come close to winning - you lose. Now I know what your thinking, ""you're just a bad poker player"". But I'm not, in fact, I've been playing poker in real life and in games for almost 2 years now. As another one of my side-hobbies, now please bear with me when I say this game is a slap in the face to the common poker player. Because 70% of the time you find that your cards are not better, by a long-shot or a short one. Now I know Telltale can do better with this, and it has in the past and the future with their other games. (Including the first Poker Night at the Inventory.) I have played the first poker night, and even on the hardest level - and I could win tournaments. But sorry to say, in this game that doesn't matter if you have a decent hand.  But for some others this might not be a problem, but for me and maybe a couple of other decent poker players it is. I'm not trying to be a sissy when I say I cannot have a decent hand and never win. Frankly I don't care about the achievements at all, I just love poker in general. But to me this game just ruins it, Telltale needs to put some realism into the game. Thank you			"

												The game is unplayable due to a game-breaking bug. Whenever a sidepot forms and one of the two players still in the main plot folds, the game gets stuck and does not progress. Sure, you could play in a convoluted way to try to avoid this situation ever occurring, but that isn't very fun. There doesn't appear to be any fix and it hardly seems like the game is supported. If I can't get through a single tournament, I definitely cannot recommend this.			"

												Poker Nights is a game about playing texas hold'em with NPC's for in-game items for other titles. The first one was fun, funny and challenging. Can go pretty back and forth but the player feels like they themselves had control.This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ and should go ♥♥♥♥ itself as hard as humanly possible till it bleeds from its ♥♥♥♥. Ive seen myself reach 300k in winnings, and drop to 20k in a couple hours. The RP cannot be skipped. The dealer will (turn from turn) deal the worst possible combination of cards ive ever seen. Believe me when i say, I play at casinos every month with funds i dont use on bills and such. My account is proof I have decent funds, but this game feels....scripted. It will, WILL screw you over for whatever reason. I almost grinded my teeth to dust screaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at my monitor as I watch attempts fall for nothing.This game is a god damn chore. When i SOMEDAY get the last couple items I need for the borderlands 2 / TF 2 drops, I will uninstall this game, rip out my hard drive that contains the files this game called home, chop it into pieces and burn the remains, ♥♥♥♥ on the burning pile and flip it all the birds I can as fast as I possibly can and ♥♥♥♥♥slap the Dev team personally for turning what should be a relaxing game of cards into this cancerous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You killed a game I love. I wont even casino this month. I dont have it in me.9/10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off again.			"

												Poker Night 1 with slightly better UI, a reworked Rewards system, less-interesting unlocks, and all the personality of a can of Coke Zero.When your single-player poker game relies on unlocks and personality to sell itself, that's not a good thing.Danny Webber, the voice of Ash, deserves special mention as one of the most wooden voice actors I've heard in 2013. David Nowlin (Sam) is in way over his head as usual, failing to add the comedic punctuation and nuance that Sam's lines demand (one of the many reasons why the Telltale incarnation of Sam & Max has fallen far short of the original). Brock Samson is about as bland a character as it gets - deliberately so or not, it makes no difference; intentional blandness is still blandness. And finally, Claptrap manages to be even more obnoxious than both Strong Bad and Tycho combined - an achievement of sorts, I suppose.The lines themselves repeat much quicker than the original Poker Night (it seems each character only has one ""reaction"" to an all-in, and given that all-ins occur quite often in poker, believe you me this is quite noticeable), and the TF2 rewards are a pair of Scout socks without a football (objectively inferior to the Football Manager socks), a mediocre Pyro hat, a Spy mask which by virtue of being a Spy cosmetic means that nobody will ever notice, and a Sniper hat that looks like five other Sniper hats. In other words, honestly nothing worth suffering through the stilted dialogue and soulless emptiness of ""Poker: Vs. CPU"".Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's worth it.			"

												Much worse than the first game.1. Unable to skip most of the dialog with the right-click. Seriously, how could you do such a regression? Only the pre-game Winslow lines are skippable at all.2. Well, so maybe it's possible to go to the settings and just reduce chatter like it was in the first game? Nope, such option is similarly not available. WTF regression #2.3. Players bet completely randomly, they go all in with a low pair too many times. The bets are much heigher than in the first game too (which I guess is considered an improvement by some), but with wild loose betting this is just insane to play against. I've had many times gotten in a situation where they go all in with garbage on the flop, you call them out on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and then miraculously they get a flush on the river – and you go start another tournament. Aggravating.4. Well, maybe there is, just like in the first game, a setting to flip ""from easy to hard"" that would suddenly make opponents sane? Nope. Not available either. WTF regression #3.5. The GLaDOS is wrtiten terribly. Super poorly. How could you misunderstand this character. The original GLaDOS never insults or underrates the player directly, her ""burns"" are quite smart and detached from an emotion to hurt the player, and this one is just spurring with stupid shallow ""you're stupid"" remarks. Idioticly unskippable repeatable remarks. This wouldn't have been a problem in the first game, where you can just right-click as soon as you hear the beginning of the ""biting in the ample posterior"" line, but nooooo.The better announcement of the rounds endings, a good probability system on showdowns — if only those would combine with the first game, it would be excellent. But no, this ""progress"" is hindered too much with intolerable regressions.			"

All of those dialogs are unskippable and the comments the NPCs make are always negative, I don't know what they tried to achieve by that but hearing only taunt and insults on my intelligence, whether I'm bluffing or actually playing a good hand, does NOT correspond to a fun experience to me...TL;DR: You know these shooters where all the NPCs focus on you as if you had a 10B bounty on your head, that's how this game feels...However I do recommend Poker night 1, it's way better and actualyl fun to play.

Poker Night 2 is the poker game I always wanted. Quick, easy, with fun dialogue and characters. If you like the game of poker, and want to play it with some characters from video games, or if you just want the TF2 items, for this price, it's a steal. It gets repetitive, yes, but there's a lot of fun in just sitting down and play some poker while listening to music in the background.+ Good graphics, Telltale-style, so it's a bit cartoonish+ Easy to run+ There's a lot of fun in just playing poker+ Fun characters+ Funny dialogue+ Great timewaster+ Cheap= I think if multiplayer was added, this would be more played and more funOverall, I'd recommend picking this up if you like poker, Portal 2, TF2, or just want the TF2 items. It's a great title, with lots of fun to be had.Final conclusionA: Must have.B: Great game, picking this title up in a sale is almost a steal.C: It's OK, worth it in a sale, but lower your expectationsD: Not worth it, unless it's 90% off, or if you really want itE: Technical disaster, do not buy this at any circumstances			"

												This isn't a bad game at all. I went looking for a Poker game, hopefully Texas Hold'em to brush up on it. I have a couple old casino games lying around but when i saw this on sale i picked it up. Includes some of my favorite fictional characters (what a ragtag cast..) Brock Sampson and Ash Williams. The Poker in the game is really fun and just as realistic as any other. While you play you get to listen to the characters chat back and forth in whitty and sometimes hilarious conversations. If you know The Venture Brothers, The Evil Dead, Borderlands 2, or Portal (I'm not sure where the dog is from...) then you'll laugh at all the little inside jokes they make that involve whatever movie or game they're in.This game is fun for messing and, practicing Poker, and just a generally good casual game.If you're looking for anything other than what i just described, you shouldn't buy this. But for fans of these games or movies and fans of poker, I reccomend.6/10			"

												It's a single player poker game, its fun, challenging, gives tf2/Borderlands 2 items/skins, it has characters from different games, their jokes and conversations are fun, but after playing some hours they become repetitive but you can unlock more while earning tokens, this game doesn't have a lot to do, but for 5€/$ is good. If Telltale decides to make a 3rd part they could add a The Walking Dead character, this would be awesome.However it has some issues when you unlock some Borderlands 2 bounty items, it's really more a Gearbox SHiFT issue because Borderlands 2 uses it detect shift codes or other stuff on your account(separated from Steam), and it won't detect like half of your obtained items for Borderlands 2, so you have to keep trying or write to Gearbox support, tf2 has no problems with that since this game don't use any stupid non-Steam account system inside their game.

												I recall buying this game because one: it was on sale, and two: I was more interested in the interactions and humor from the featured characters, which are worth seeing if you're into light video game humor. The game is worth ""check""ing out, especially if you're into Patrick Warburton, which I have to say is my biggest highlight of the game.As for the poker elements, it's simple and to the point. Easy tutorials to figure out and a bit of fun to get your opponents drunk, unless you buy them one.Nothing else to say other than to get it when it's on sale or not, either way, you're picking up a little gem.

												Sigh.I have tried to enjoy this game, I really havee but I just cannot, even if you want to play with game and cartoon characters you love I still can't recemend this game to you.If you dished out the small price for this game then it was most likely because they dangled team fortress 2 and borderlands 2 items in front of you and I bet that you stopped playing when you got the items, why?Poker games are suppose to be based on chance and be a enjoyable experiance with a high reward if you manage to win your hand BUT this game seems to disagree, the game's AI loves to ♥♥♥♥ tease you by dealing the card that will make you lose LAST, and no this is not a series of bad luck, this is consistant for EVERYONE, you can easily look on youtube and find a overstock of videos with the same event which means there is no chance, your going to fail if you all in everytime!Next up I would like to talk about the conversations and characters interations with you, and let me be blunt. they love treating you like s*** no I'm not kidding, it is not jeers or jokes about you, this is literaly pure spite, but with a character like glados this is understandable, she is not programmed to be ""user friendly"" if you play portal you know that very well but all characters treat you like this, one moment that really annoyed me was when the characters had a pre game conversation, one character asked why it was 20,000 buy in instead of the old 10,000 before-hand (why was that believed to be a improvement I don't know) and the host explains ""this was to bring in more upper class gamblers to the club"" and literaly one of the chacters ask ""then what is the player doing here then""That line would have been ok if the other characters went into uproar saying that was uncalled for and mean but instead what do they do, they all take a long stare at you, no other words are spoken and no expression is on their face, they just look silently at you and start to play, this is few of the actions they will perform to you.But there are a few good things to the game, one of which is being able to buy the characters drinks, getting them slightly drunk you can acturaly make them show off tells so you know if its a bluff and you can call on them, this would have been a great feature but the AI is ♥♥♥♥ed and the characters will do tells even if they have the most godly hand and even if it does suck the AI will give them a winning hand on the final card so it does not matter too much.On your loss Glados will come down to you and make fun of your loss, telling you are worthless and provide nothing to the world, then your kicked from your match back to the main menu, thats the best part, after being treated like crap you have even faster access to getting out of the game and uninstalling.Unless you like being treated like dirt.I recemend that youavoid this game at all costs.Buy the first one if you really want to play poker with game characters.

												This is not the game to play a lot of fast hands of poker, this game is like playing poker with your friends: random talk, jokes and fun.Even though the AI may be predictable sometimes you will have a lot of fun trying to understand each player's strategy, guessing their bluffs (you will find them obvious eventually), and deducing their hands listening to their quotes and studing their faces and movements. 100% recommended if you like to play poker with friends.And btw, if you already hate Claptrap from Borderlands games be ready to hate it even more.

												First to tell this is more than probably the best Poker game you will ever play. Yea yea its just Poker but it's still the best Poker game! Characters may not be familiar but this is a good change to know them.Dialog is awesome and it doesn't usually repeat itself and characters personality and comic make game to have a lot of repeat play changes. Of course there is now unlockable items in game and out game. In the gameplay the AI really knows how to play and it's challenging.It costs on five and it's totally great deal.

												If you like the world of Borderlands and playing Poker, (Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha) you'll enjoy this game. There are cameo appearances from characters from other games as well (I'm not so familiar with) but they all provide unique commentary that makes the game more interesting than just playing a hand of Texas Hold 'Em Poker. You can also win unique content for other games such as borderlands 2, which made it a kicker for me to start playing.			"

												This isn't a bad game at all. I went looking for a Poker game, hopefully Texas Hold'em to brush up on it. I have a couple old casino games lying around but when i saw this on sale i picked it up. Includes some of my favorite fictional characters (what a ragtag cast..) Brock Sampson and Ash Williams. The Poker in the game is really fun and just as realistic as any other. While you play you get to listen to the characters chat back and forth in whitty and sometimes hilarious conversations. If you know The Venture Brothers, The Evil Dead, Borderlands 2, or Portal (I'm not sure where the dog is from...) then you'll laugh at all the little inside jokes they make that involve whatever movie or game they're in.This game is fun for messing and, practicing Poker, and just a generally good casual game.If you're looking for anything other than what i just described, you shouldn't buy this. But for fans of these games or movies and fans of poker, I reccomend.6/10			"

Thats why they don't have the voice actor from the movies.			"

												I bought this game how many months ago and the bloody thing still doesn't work.  It just gives me an error message every time at the same point in its loading sequence.  I get the logo and the preliminary sound effects, but the game itself just up and quits whenever it tries to load the opening sequence, or the main menu for that matter.  I don't even know which comes first, I've never even seen that far past the loading screen.  This game stole five dollars, except it didn't, the package deal to throw in Poker Night 1 was all I got.  I already had the first Poker Night game, that is what inspired me to buy the sequel in the first place.  And then it turns out from a review that I didn't even miss anything because it wasn't even Bruce Campbell as Ash from Evil Dead. And now all I have to show for it is a broken game and a broken link that takes me to it.  An unfulfilled promise from a overall unfulfilling game.  I cannot say which was worse.			"

Also, if you go heads-up with an opponent, they'll often get a winning card that was already played. In other words, they'll get cards that shouldn't even be in play within the deck, if you're keeping track of the numbers.I've played lots of poker games over the years, from WSOP titles to MTV's Stacked and online poker games, and I say to go play Stacked instead of this if you can manage to get your hands on a copy.

												Tell-tale Games are back once more, with a terrible poker game which 98.5% of people buy purely for the Team Fortress 2 items! [Including myself!]In all fairness, this sequel to Poker night at the inventory isn’t actually as bad as the first one, in my opinion anyway. The AI in this game is a tad bit smarter then before, you can still try to rustle up a method of getting around it, but it is nowhere near as manipulable. And I actually enjoyed the dialog in this one a lot more than the first, still repetitive, just not as much. I could even go as far as saying that my love for borderlands 2 and portal 2 actually made this game a lot more bearable for me, due to the familiar characters that I know I love. Even the pixelated love of my life “Steve” makes an appearance. The quite humorous lines and cut scenes again make this game a lot easier to play.Although the actual gameplay part to this game has improved in my opinion, the item-grabbing side to it, I was really bummed out by. The only reason for that being that it was A LOT more difficult to get these items. And when I finally got that last one, i was actually close to celebrating. It really was a challenge getting each characters bounty item.All in all this game is an improvement on the first one, a lot more work for the items and still something I would consider to be uninteresting to people actually interested in poker. I think poker should be left to us humans; AI really isn’t a good idea when it comes to a game that’s supposed to be so well thought through. "

												To be perfectly honest I actually found Poker Night 2 to be kinda meh. While Poker Night 1 had some redeeming moments I just didn`t really feel it with this one.I think my biggest gripe is moreso to do with how Ash Williams is in this game. Don`t get me wrong I am most likely the biggest Evil Dead fan out there. But Bruce Campbell, who portrayed him in literally all of his actor and VO appearances (excluding the musical) doesn`t voice him here. It`s just jarring, like someone trying to do an impression with none of the charm.Add to that the unlocks are also pretty ehh as well, none of them particularly stand out compared to the Poker Night 1 unlocks. In general it just makes me scratch my head as to why this was made in the first place.			"

												For all Pokerfans is this a must! Its funny and the atmoshere is just cool. And for sll achievments hunters, it's easy to earn all of them. If you got Team Fortress 2 or Borderlands 2 you surely want the special items. I love these quests to end. It makes me playing longer than normal. On the first part of this game you could close and open the game until they offer their special items, here is not that easy. You have to end those quests to let them offer their special items. Cool is the new feature where you can buy some alcohol for the mates. This let them say what for a hand they have. I always wanted to change the styles sometimes because to play on the same table, background, cards and chips will get boring and here we can change these styles. Negative is that sometimes the rounds are bugged then you have to close the game to continue. This is the only negative aspect here. All in all this game is just amazing. If you love to poker or want those items then you should buy this game. You won't regret it!			"

												I enjoyed the first game and when I saw that Brock was in this one I was sold.The Good: I really like Brock and GlaDOS so everything they say is gold. This game has better graphics than the first.The Bad: The difficulty seems a lot higher than the last version (Poker Night at the Inventory) and with no gameplay options such as difficulty settings and ability to turn off the talking once you've heard it all this game can get pretty frustrating. Also, its assumed that the player is a male. Not that that is huge but its noticable.Overall: I like the original game better because it didnt cream me every single round and if I just want to play poker I could turn off the chatting. You get this version to basically hear the new convos with your favorite characters.			"

												An immersive and funny game. It definitely feels like playing with friends in real life, but with video game characters. They'll eventually start making small talk, discussing about anything and it will get repetitive after a while, but it's a rather immersive atmosphere, with the characters feeling like being alive with their gestures, their replies and their moves. GLaDOS makes an excellent dealer, with her snide remarks as always. It could use more characters to play with, though, if we want tournaments, more characters should be attempting to play in, even if they can't play all at the same time. It would be more diverse and even more challenging. Despite this minor flaw (that is understandable), it's a real fun game, and I would recommend it again and again if I could.			"

												It's poker. I shouldn't need to describe that any further. If you don't already know what poker is then you prolly shouldn't buy this game.The neat thing about Poker Night 2 isn't in the actual gameplay. Again, it's just poker. What makes the game neat is the fact that you're playing poker with an interesting set of characters. Each character has their own set of tells and conversations they will strike up with each other. It's fun and cute for a while.I say ""for a while"" because eventually they start repeating themselves. Once I started seeing the same dialog over and over, I started to tune it out. At that point, I was really just playing computer poker by myself. So overall: It's poker. Do you want to play poker or not?			"

												For all Pokerfans is this a must! Its funny and the atmoshere is just cool. And for sll achievments hunters, it's easy to earn all of them. If you got Team Fortress 2 or Borderlands 2 you surely want the special items. I love these quests to end. It makes me playing longer than normal. On the first part of this game you could close and open the game until they offer their special items, here is not that easy. You have to end those quests to let them offer their special items. Cool is the new feature where you can buy some alcohol for the mates. This let them say what for a hand they have. I always wanted to change the styles sometimes because to play on the same table, background, cards and chips will get boring and here we can change these styles. Negative is that sometimes the rounds are bugged then you have to close the game to continue. This is the only negative aspect here. All in all this game is just amazing. If you love to poker or want those items then you should buy this game. You won't regret it!			"

												Enjoyed the first game, but cannot recommend the second.  Repetitive dialog that cannot be disabled continually slows down the game.  Although it was a bit fun at first.The game also cheats, for lack of a better term.  Based purely on game statistics, it appears that there is a mechanism in place to keep players from going all in.  I play a lot of hold-em and it is pretty obvious to me that the game is not on the level when the player goes all in.  Play the hand with standard betting, no problem.  Go all in with a 80% hand and you will lose 90% of the time.  So, standard hold-em strategy will not work properly.In pure English the deck is stacked against you in a way that defies normal play when you go all in.  You will lose a lot more than you should.  I am not talking a little bit either.  They probably did this to weed out the players who go all-in all the time and win based on pure luck and not skill, but it removes an element that makes hold-em the popular go to game every where, the show down.  Couple that handicap with the fact that some of the bounties require you to win those show downs and this gets even more frustrating as the only real way to do this is grind away until the game gives you a break and lets you win a hand you should win with no problem.

												This game ♥♥♥♥ing Sucks. Extremely limited dialogue means u listen to the same ♥♥♥♥ing sentences after every hand. The game was so slow paced that it drove me insane because you can't adjust the level of chit chat like you could in Poker Night 1.Combine this with the AI saying the same things every 30 seconds makes this game a nightmare to play. Each tournament takes like 30 minutes so good luck getting those promo items. Another thing, those morons at Telltale Games stuffed the achievement system so those who play this single player game in offline mode will have to contact Gearbox and Steam support for their items.

												A TERRIBLE Poker game. In this day and age who wants to play Poker with AI? You know the ones who only bet if they have good cards? The dialogue is okay, but they begin to repeat themselves after a while, and they drag on the hands.If you really want a Poker game, find one where you can play online with other people / friends. Full House Poker on Xbox Live is one of my favorites. Unless you want to grind (for hours) trying to unlock the cosmetic items in TF2 and borderlands 2, I'd highly suggest passing this up.			"

There is a higher chance of the sun turning into a blackhole tomorrow than this occurring by chance. It may seem that I am whining, to be honest if this only happened maybe once or twice in a blue moon I wouldn't get so salty, but for some reason it happens more often than it should which leads me to believe they want people to play the game as long as possible and to listen to all of the funny dialogue and quips they put in the game for us. For most people they probably just got this for the items, me I got it because I wanted to enjoy a fun poker games that had characters I am fond of. The AI isn't hard to beat or anything, it's just the game wants to punish or suppress yoloing behaviour that can win rounds too quickly.The game wants you to play carefully and to not go ham too often, most hardcore poker players may or may not like that about the game. I suggest trying some of the other poker games out there that doesn't sport a favouring system.Also not to mention the streak of bad hands that you get in this game that causes you to just be whittled down by the blinds when it comes down to 1 v 1. I've had many times where I got jack crap for over 20 hands and the AI just has all the god hands betting in the double digits, if the ai get ahead they will just steal the blinds everytime bullying you out of the game with little to nothing to do. Sometimes it seems that the RNG bugs out at a point. I've had hands where I went from 80k in the lead to 20k and a lose just to blinds alone and crappy cards hand over hand. A 30 minute game ends up being an hour just to the horrible RNG a lot of the time. That or the blinds just suck you dry, and god hands you play turn out to be beaten by the stupidest of rivers.			"

												Whether or not I reccomend this game was kind of a toss up at first, because I love playing poker games and this one is pretty funny.  Unfortunately there are is a major issue for me. No matter how many times I re-install this game it just won't work at all for me. I've tried installing it on four different computers (multiple times) and each time it crashes before it even gets to the title screen. That's a huge issue, and a lot of other people I've talked to have had the same one.I've played on a friend's account where it worked half the time, and it was a pretty nice game. It had humourous dialouge and made me feel like I was good at poker. It had a lot of downsides though. The jokes became pretty monotinous after a few hands, often cycling through ones that were said just moments before and after a while you had heard every one. There are non-skipable scenes in this as well, which makes farming for the items that you can get a bit frustrating. It often ignores your hands as well in the game, allowing for an NPC to win when you clearly would.The negative aspects outweigh the positive, but since I personally like playing poker games I purchased it I was hoping to play it when I wanted to killl some time (the items being a nice bonus too). Since it doesn't work for me and I ended up wasting my money and my time by installing it over and over, I'm giving it a negitive review. But if you want you can take a chance, because it may work for you. Good luck. :3			"

It often ignores your hands as well in the game, allowing for an NPC to win when you clearly would.The negative aspects outweigh the positive, but since I personally like playing poker games I purchased it I was hoping to play it when I wanted to killl some time (the items being a nice bonus too). Since it doesn't work for me and I ended up wasting my money and my time by installing it over and over, I'm giving it a negitive review. But if you want you can take a chance, because it may work for you. Good luck. :3			"

												For those that are familiar with the first game, they will feel right at home here.  Even at the title screen, references to the games and videos that the game's characters overflow here.  From the gorillas from Sam & Max to the bartender from Borderlands, there is always something around to tie the oddly matched characters together.  There is even is photo at the staircase showing the characters from the first game.  If you are willing to let your eyes roam, there is plenty to see.Another visual detail about the game is the unlockables.  Just like the first game, you can earn unlockables that lets the player customize the look of the game.  Unlike the first game, those unlockables have an affect on the game.  By using an entire set, it causes both how the area looks as well as how the characters talk.  A prime example of this is watching your opponents leaving through the Venture Brothers' teleporter.  Knowing that each set has something special to see, this gives extra variety to what the characters could say and do.Speaking of the talking, that is the real draw about the game.  As with most Telltale Games titles, the humor alone makes the game worth playing.  From moments like the robots dealing with paradoxes, Ash learning about his unknown fame, and Brock dealing with dubstep, listening to what they have to say will keep you coming back to more.The one big problem about the first game is still present in this game.  That problem is the lack of variety in the gameplay.  Seeing that Texas Hold 'em is the most popular version of poker, it is understandable that they feature it in this game.  New to the mix is Omaha, a variant of Texas Hold 'em.  However, they still choose to ignore other popular variants of the game.  Games like Stud and the classic Draw are out of the mix.  Even within the Community games, there are more games like Razz available to play.  By only focusing on two similar versions of same game, the gameplay still feels limited.  Once you are used to the two games, it will leave you wanting more.  Having Blind Man's Bluff, something featured in Sam & Max Episode 103, would have been perfect for Telltale's style of humor.  If they are going to make a third game, they really need to add more types of games, not just slight changes of the same game.			"

												The first Poker Night was a middle-of-the-road for me, but on the bright side it has taught me a lot of the basics of poker. Poker Night 2, however, seems to take that logic and throw it out the window.Before, your experience mainly depended on your skills with the element of chance that all card games have to offer. However, in Poker Night 2, the odds seem to be stacked against you. (Or at least is a buggy mess, but considering the types of glitches I've come across it's likely the former.)As I mentioned above, this seems to be a buggy mess. For instance, during a showdown against Claptrap, the odds meter on the top of the screen read my odds as 51%.... and Claptrap's as 52%.I've also been the victim of ""lesser readings"" as I call them, where the game interperets your hand not as the highest it possibly can, but rather as the lowest. For instance, in a 1 on 1 showdown with Max, a Flush that I had was read as a single pair of 2s; still technically right, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonetheless.All in all, Poker Night 2 is a terribly broken trainwreck that pales in comparison to the original. Sure the new opponents are a nice change but I feel that the glitches and bugs it presents make it unworthy of most Steam libraries. "

												Meh. Almost everything in Poker Night 2 feels bad comparing to Poker night in the inventory.If you're here just for the hats, wait for the sale, try to play it, then unlock your achievements using cheats.The casino is way more crowdy, no more little comfy company.The players are overall bad, except may be the Claptrap, as long as he doesn't flirt with Glados.You thought Strong Bad was bad? Well, enjoy the company of such mоrоns like Brock Samson and Ash Williams.I don't care if they were good in their own universes, they don't belong in poker night.The game starts with Brock wasting the previous unnamed player, then Ash says ""We're all celebrities here, and who's this lame"" (pointing on you). Then, after you knock out everyone except Brock, he'll threaten to beat you up if you win the tournament and then he's told that the winner will be escorted by casino security to prevent this.Very friendly and relaxing atmosphere, right? And don't forget Glados popping up on the screen every other minute, spamming its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice lines.The only good thing in this game so far is various list of cosmetic unlocks for decks, cards, chips and even the casino itself (although the prices are weird, portal themed items costs much more than borderlands themed items, for example) and a huge variety of additional dialogues you can enable with activating the whole set of themed unlocks.Requested: list of tf2 items you can get from this game.[wiki.teamfortress.com] "

It is a lot of fun to watch them in full conversations with each other during the game. Listening to them telling stories about their personal lives, cracking jokes at each other, showing emotions of sarcasm, anger, nervousness and sympathy as the game plays out.For a poker game, I found Poker Night 2 very entertaining and highly recommend it if you are a fan of the characters from their TV shows, movies and video games. :)			"

												If you're here for the TF2 items, be ready to invest some hours into this game. Unlike it's younger brother, you cannot simply rush achievements; there's a new bounty system. The bounty system can be extremely unforgiving, especially to those who don't know the game very well. The cards that you are dealt can also make you want to uninstall the game, especially when you are drawing dead for 30+ hands. The bots don't know that they're doing, sometimes they flop a house and other times call with air/limp with nothing. You cannot predict the bots, and be sure to only all in when you have something higher than two-pair, because this game can screw you up. A letdown in terms of poker, you can't even skip the dialogue; and after a while it just gets so annoying. Once I get all the promo items, I'll  be sure to uninstall this one.EDIT: Lost my first potential bounty item with a Queen 10 to 5 3. You'd think they turn the game in your favour...			"

												It looks quite neat at first and the ability to unlock BL2 (also TF2 but screw TF2) items is sweet, but...I could swear the game cheats, the AI knows when I'm bluffing and won't fold if I am whereas if I have a really good hand they back away from even a tiny raise (or 'happen' to have an EVEN BETTER hand). Surely this could just be coincidence but I'm starting to see a grim pattern here.The dialogue gets painfully repetitive after two or three hours and you can't skip anything but the tournament intro speech. Some pieces of dialogue take a while and make the game torturously slow.I've never been very good at poker in real life so I can't really tell what's the game cheating and what's me being rubbish but I'm quite convinced the game doesn't play exactly fair. After a while the only reason I keep playing it is to get the unique items for a different game so that's probably not a sign of this one being that amazing in itself.			"

												A weak sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory. The character selection is a lot less synergistic than the original and feels like it was just made with licensing leftovers. Unlike Original Inventory, the dialogue between characters is VERY annoying, full of memes, and they took away the ability to set how frequently conversations start as well as the ability to skip lines, meaning if you play the game for more than a few minutes you will find yourself losing control of the game for long periods of time while the circle of play is interrupted for another unskippable cutscene you've already seen a hundred times. Glados is scripted to mock you no matter which move you make, even if you play well, and her sass is also unskippable, which just makes the game a slow-paced, annoying slog where every hand you wait 45 seconds for someone to finish repeating a story just so you can click Check and then wait another 10 seconds while Glados explains why you're an idiot until you find the one button she doesn't have a comeback for: Quit.

Poker Night 2 is basically a comedy card game that offers you Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 items in the form in-game bounties in order to entice you. It is my belief that most people buy the game based on the items rather than on its own merit, but both Poker Nights are decent games due unsurprisingly to their iconic cast that give these games personality. This second entry in my opinion exceeds the first only because it is more polished with better AI, but they both have what I consider entertaining dialogue (which unfortunately starts to get repetitive after a few hours) and it is a relatively easy way to learn how to play poker.Yes I recommend Poker Night 2, it is priced appropriately and the item promotion only adds to its appeal. You could however wait for a sale if you do not wish for whatever reason to pay the paltry sum, it's basically free when it's reduced by an eighty percent markdown which is very often. If you don't like poker, that's fine, get it for its personality, if this game doesn't appeal to you then I guess it's your loss because it costs practically nothing to a first world citizen.I'd like to also add that the achievement We Are The 1% is ridiculous and it would normally take you fifty or more hours to complete. If this is a problem what you can do is press Alt + F4 when it's clear that you're about to lose the game, then relaunch and you'll begin the same turn with a new hand. The game saves after every turn so this is why it works, the rest of the achievements are relatively easy.E-RANKD-RANKC-RANKB-RANKA-RANKS-RANKI cleared this game on April 26th, 2014. "

												Frustrating. I consider myself somewhat good at poker. I always seem to win against my friends and in other games. I have played probably around 20 rounds and have not won even once. Maybe I just suck but I have seen things in this game that I have never seen in real life poker. Some of the other opponents just get too lucky... Another gripe is that the hands are obviously pre determined and not random at all. I have seen more than 4 of the same cards more than once. It kept happening with claptrap, we would both get 3 of a kind and tie with the same cards. There is no way that there can be 6 aces on the table because there are only 4 in a deck. That in itself is an obvious flaw and is what has made me quit playing this game. I cannot reccomend this game but I can however, reccomend the poker in Watchdogs.

												DISCLAIMER: Don't play this game for too long in one sitting or very often. It could really use some setting adjustments and extra features. If you don't love Poker too much, then don't bother with this game, obviously.First off, I like the game concept in the sense that it's Poker (Texas or Omaha) with the addition of some nice characters from TV and video games: Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands, Ash from Evil Dead, Sam & Max from... Sam & Max, and GLaDOS from Portal. The game has an interesting personality with these characters because there's actually good dialogue and some very funny scenes that happen as you play. Hearing the characters bicker back and forth, or listening to GLaDOS giving sarcastic put-downs is hilarious.On the other hand, the above is really the only thing ""extra"" to the game. Without it, it's just another Poker game, and the bonus characters wear off pretty quickly. It's not that the characters and their personalities bother me, but it's that there simply isn't enough dialogue for the game, and there aren't enough game setting to manage.I had only played the game for less than a couple of hours, completing a few matches/tournaments, and already started encountering a lot of the same dialogue, thus it became very boring very quickly. The sad part about that is there aren't any settings to manage that. You cannot skip dialogue unless it is before the whole match begins or you just folded and want to skip to the next hand. If you are in the middle of the game, you just have to sit and wait. Many times did I place my bet and had to wait nearly over a minute to make my next move, because the characters would talk a lot before the next person would fold or bet.A minute isn't a lot of time, but when it happens very often, it can take a lot just to finish one hand and can be very boring if you have heard all of the dialogue by that point. Similarly, you can't change any gameplay settings to limit the dialogue.On top of the dialogue, you will encounter certain cutscenes sometimes in the middle of a match or when someone is eliminated or you win the game. You can't skip these either, thus they are just you sitting there for 3+ minutes at a time when you have seen them already as well.The only thing to change the dialogue is to change the Unlockables to 3 items matching one of the characters (e.g., a Venture Bros theme for the room). Doing so adds extra dialogue while you have all 3 items activated, and the dialogue pertains mostly to the matching character and things involving the show or game world. While the new rooms are a nice touch, you still run out of dialogue quickly, and further the rooms actually add longer custcenes for elimination and winning, thus you have to sit and repeat things even more.All in all, that really makes the game boring and take way more time after you've played a handful of rounds (per room). Being able to manage the dialogue occurrence and being able to skip it and the scenes would be a lot more useful if you're tired of seeing the same thing over and over.Because of the above, the game therefore turns into a basic Poker game that is artificially extended by repetitive dialogue and scenes. No other real settings exist for the game, and the only extra addition to the game is the Bounties. The Bounties are essentially goals that you get and you must complete 3 of them in order to compete for a Bounty Item. Once you get to the Bounty Item, you must win the entire match (and eliminate everyone) in order to win the Bounty Item. Once you do, you simply unlock an item for Borderlands 2 and for Team Fortress 2.The Bounties themselves are really a pain. They are randomly generated, and once you get them, you cannot change them. Depending on your luck, you may get really simple Bounties like ""Order a drink"" or ""Come in 3rd place or better"", which are relatively simple things to do. Otherwise, you will get the worst ones such as ""Win with a flush or better"" or ""Win with a high card"" which can take indefinitely to get, because none of those things are up to you. They are just up to luck. Having to win with a high card means pretty much everybody at the table has to get no special card matches and then you just have a King and everyone else has less, for instance. There's a few other ways to get it, but it's really less often than winning with a Pair, for instance.You just have to play and play and play and play, eventually getting the Bounties. It is just a waste of time and pointless, since there really isn't any skill involved in those. Poker does require skill, but only in terms of generally winning, not winning with a specific pattern.All in all, I don't mean to say that the game is terrible. The dialogue and scenes, when you first experience them, are absolutely hilarious and I loved it. But the game dies out pretty quickly, and it's a shame. They really should have added some extra features and especially configuration to the game.			"

After a few hours of playing however, the repeated jokes get very worn out.

												I really wanted to like this game. It had all the good things a poker night game should have, and it carried not onyl big name characters, but unlockables for 2 other games. But after several hours of gameplay, I have to toss it into the ♥♥♥♥ pile.The Banter between the characcters is good, but in general the game is insulting to the player with every move they make. After wiping all of them out 3 times, being called an idiot for the moves I make just starts to ♥♥♥♥ me off. Bad move.But seeing as I piad a buck and a quarter for the game, I wasn't going to complain. But it had another, nastier secret.4 times in a row I had a winning full house. 4 times in a row I went all in because I had a winning full house. 4 times I lost because it only counted it as 3 of a kind. The game can't even do the basic poker playing that my 1980's Macintosh could do with ease. They got a few rights, slapped together a few voice actors and put nothing into the game mechanics. Then they insult you on top of it. If you want to throw away your money for nostalgia, this is your game. If you are looking to play poker...let's hope you like long dialog before it gives you a chance to do anything.1 out of 5 stars. And the 1 is because I liked a couple of the characters.			"

												People sometimes sit there for ten or twenty seconds at a time. And they like to say the same things, over, and over, and over again. Yes Sam, we get it, dogs can see in colour. And yes Brock, you can buy a lot of bowie knives with that money.It's very buggy, and I can't really recommend it even for the promos. Clicking a button too soon locks up the game completely, and everyone just sits there staring at you forever. And if you want the promos, you have to complete three challenges to unlock a bounty challenge. Those three challenges can be something like, ""Win a showdown with just a kicker"". In other words, I hope you like poker, because you're going to be playing a LOT of it.Basically, it's poker. But if you want poker, there's better things for it. Like going out, getting friends, and playing with them. Only buy this if you want the promo items.			"

												I picked up this game for a solid key, and i must say it was worth it entirely! This game is extremly fun to play, and knocking players from your favourite games (such as clap trap and Sam) of the table is very enjoyable! However, there is a minor set back that may swing if you want to buy this game or not, and that is the in game items that you can obtain from this game (for tf2 and borderlans). In Poker Night 1, it was random and the players would put their items up, however, now you have to complete a set of challenges, then knock every player of the table in order to win the item. I find this fun and challenging, but i can see why people wouldn't like this change.(Would reccomend picking Poker Night 1 up as well!)			"

												People sometimes sit there for ten or twenty seconds at a time. And they like to say the same things, over, and over, and over again. Yes Sam, we get it, dogs can see in colour. And yes Brock, you can buy a lot of bowie knives with that money.It's very buggy, and I can't really recommend it even for the promos. Clicking a button too soon locks up the game completely, and everyone just sits there staring at you forever. And if you want the promos, you have to complete three challenges to unlock a bounty challenge. Those three challenges can be something like, ""Win a showdown with just a kicker"". In other words, I hope you like poker, because you're going to be playing a LOT of it.Basically, it's poker. But if you want poker, there's better things for it. Like going out, getting friends, and playing with them. Only buy this if you want the promo items.			"

												Poker Night 2 builds on it's predicessor and improves the experience in almost every way. You are able to interact with the environment a lot more this time around, from not only being able to customise your decks and tables, but the entire scenary of the hotel. The characters dialogue is very entertaining, and goals and side objectives make Texas Hold'em even more fun. My only gripe is that winning can be very easily exploited by restarting the game, which took away a lot of the high-risk experience that comes with Poker; and yes, you could easily NOT use this method, but knowing the option is there makes the risk feel cheapened. At it's asking price, this game is a definate buy, in my oppinion.Hope this was helpful. :)			"

												With $96,000 in a 1 on 1 against ash, he gets 2 aces the flop then revealing another ace or even 2, 3 hands in a row, then getting a 1% chance flush, a 20% chance straight, and continues his hands that cannot ever lose until I have 20k and he has 80k; this ♥♥♥♥ didn't happen once, I had this or other such systematic forced losses over and over again. So if you want to play poker I suggest you find a game where the odds and the players involved matter and it isn't a pre-determined flop and hand before you even get your cards.Not only that but any time I had any chance of winning (that fit to the pre-determined flop) every character just folds, I could simply call and the next chance they get they fold. One might say the point of the game is the witty commentary, but that is only 90 minutes or so, and you can simply listen to that anywhere, when the game is so rigged that you could just go all in every hand and have the same end result why even bother playing? In conclusion, if you want a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game where the only victory you get is a forced fold on a pre-determined hand/flop for all AI and yourself, and spend 30-100 minutes every game only to find out you had no real chance of winning to begin with then you can get this game, but I think you could find a better use for $5, like a cheap aids infected ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with no condoms, at least then when you have a guaranteed end you get to have sex.♥♥♥♥ this game, the items aren't worth it.

The only one winning here is whoever decided that rushing out the same game with a slightly different setting and lesser-known characters wasn't a one-way ticket to Hell for excessive greed.Who are these characters anyway? Last game, they got Max from Sam and Max who we should all remember from childhood cartoons, Strong Bad from the most awesome flash website ever created, The Heavy from a FPS, and one original character who was a spoof of what TTG thinks of gamers which was actually somewhat amusing at times.This time, there's a bland angry guy who has the voice of Joe from Family Guy, some annoying robot thing that claims to be from Pandora but definitely was not in Avatar and was probably only included so the graphics people could work less, some guy called Ash who can't be the adult version of the Pokemon character unless he's fighting undead Marowaks or something, and finally the only character who isn't out of nowhere or just made up, Sam from Sam and Max.Even having Sam is barely enough, he was only given about 4 good lines, all where he's talking with Max rather than these other personality-deprived nobodies. Much more often, you're stuck hearing annoying robot guy's excessively long voice clips that can't be skipped and which pause the action (there really should be an option to mute him or replace him with Max or something), or having to hear 10+ times a game everyone overact to every All-In, despite how commonly the AI does it themselves. But at least GLADOS is the dealer so we don't have to hear bland short sailor guy talk much anymore.If you want to play poker online, find some other free website to play it at, it's not worth it to get this just for Sam, Max, and a couple of other much less interesting personalities, all backed by the same stupidly bluffing AI as the last game.

Yea, don't believe those guys who played 2 hours of it and complain over repeating jokes, I played more than ten hours and still discover new lines! And I could enjoy GLaDOS' two or three jokes over and over again!tldr: PN2 is great! You'll love it!Update: 17,6 hours in, first game breaking bug... and I had a perfect hand! Still recommending this one! ;)			"

												I want to start off by saying, it starts off pretty fun. The cast is pretty good, and you get free items for two great games.The negatives of this game are, the character talk gets old real quick. Every time you either go all in or fold, they give you ♥♥♥♥ for it. Funny at first, but kind of annoying after a while. Also, it's totally fixed. I might have just been having a bad WEEK, but damn near every time I'm all-in heads upp with one of the bots, he gets the %1 chance of winning over me. Litterly every time. It just gets old after a while. Just irritating. Wish it would be a little more fair, I'm just trying to have fun			"

												I really like poker so that's why I bought the game, not for the TF2 items. I will probably give them away for free. Anyways, the game is hilariuos, the character lines are cool and funny. The game calls you ""our silent friend"". That describes me perfectly because I don't talk much. :D Only didn't like the part when the others insult you. Overall I give it a 9/10 and I recommend it.

												I'm terrible at poker, but that dosen't stop me from enjoying this game. I'll admit that I bought it for the unlockables and was slightly interested by the characters, but having played it I must say its selling point is the dialogue. It is very well done, with all of the conversations having little to do with what is going on in the hand but more about the games of the characters themselves.  I may have slight bias due to GLaDOS being the dealer (She would not be as funny playing poker, that's for sure) but I would recommend this game to anyone who knows any of the characters here, regardless of how much they like poker. (There is an easy way to win each hand if you suck like I do, just look in the community guides.)			"

												I know almost everyone plays this game for the TF2 items, but here's how that's gonna go.Before we start, an exploit: If you close the game, it resets the last hand dealt when you come back in. Ergo, go all in all you want, there's no riskYou'll steamroll the first game.The second game will have three arbitrary challenges that will happen in any game.The third game will have run out of lines, and all you'll be hearing from this point on is:Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. The poker algorithm is very basic, don't expect any of the other players to react to the possibility of having a hand, they only react to the amount of chips you use to bluff or raise at random to bluff, regardless of the cards on the table. Max will never ever bluff though.Also, you can buy them drinks at the start of the game, which makes them do their very obvious animation that reveals if they have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand.Oh, and they go all-in all the time. They'll go all in for a pair of twos when there's Ace, King, Queen, Jack on the table. In fact, Claptrap loves to go all in on the blinds.Also, after the second game, you will rarely ever win a hand. The characters will always magically have a better hand than you. Oh, you have a Straight Flush? Well, the guy you went all in to has a Royal Flush. However, Brock and Ash always have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hands. It's always a pair or two, never higher. You'll knock one or both of them on the first hand almost 1/3 times. Visually, it's pretty great. Everyone actually looks very much like they should. AND, unlike the first game, it doesn't have that stilted Telltale Pose-To-Pose animation where the character's face moves into an expression, then their body starts moving, then they stop moving, change faces, start another animation sequence.The characters will talk ♥♥♥♥ on every move you make, stopping the flow of the game, which makes you wish they get into a scripted sequence, because when that happens, they just play the ♥♥♥♥ing game.I give this game a Shut The ♥♥♥♥ Up GlaDOS/10			"

												Poker Night 2 builds on it's predicessor and improves the experience in almost every way. You are able to interact with the environment a lot more this time around, from not only being able to customise your decks and tables, but the entire scenary of the hotel. The characters dialogue is very entertaining, and goals and side objectives make Texas Hold'em even more fun. My only gripe is that winning can be very easily exploited by restarting the game, which took away a lot of the high-risk experience that comes with Poker; and yes, you could easily NOT use this method, but knowing the option is there makes the risk feel cheapened. At it's asking price, this game is a definate buy, in my oppinion.Hope this was helpful. :)			"

												This game is the bestest! I get to spend so much quality time with my favorite characters from my most favoritest TV show, video games, movie, and comic! The stakes are higher than the predecessor with longer lines, longer banter between characters, a hand-ful of non-playing characters participating in the longer banter, long animation cycles for each action done by all these characters, and the cherry to top it all off: it's all unskippable! Wow! Amazing! I love Claptrap! He's so zany even though he repeats the same dialogue over and over with the same exact tells and resulting actions in the same poker sesh, even repeating himself consecutively! And all of the other characters do this too! I love your repeated naggings, GLaDOS. Please marry me! I read Girls for M and I have some good ideas on how to further highlight how pathetic I am for playing this game, which each and every character in this game rush out to make obvious, and make this all kinkier than it already is, like the repeated flirtations between Claptrap and GLaDOS. Tie me up into a hog-tie like a pig ready for slaughter, stomp on my nards, and take all my money from my wallet, because I'm going to plop down for a preorder of the sequel to this bad boy of a game!

												Did I have fun? YesCould the games be improved? DefinitlyFun, but not enough gameplay past the cards.

The prize tokens give absolutely no weight to the upgrading system.Bankroll management is possibly the most important mechanic of poker & it really is shoved in a corner, which is dissapointing.They took away the option to minimize table talk. -_-The A.I. consistently makes nonsence plays.

												You get to play cards with some of the best, iconic characters in video games, comics, television, and movies... and also you get to play with Claptrap.In all seriousness though, this is a great game for people who felt Poker Night 1 was too easy.  Your opponents are more aggressive and smarter, and are more likely to recognize when they have a good hand, or when they know you can't afford to call their bluff.  The game may seem like it cheats, but in all honesty, that's how odds work in poker.  There are times I shouldn't have won but did.  The game requires brains AND guts, and if you have only one or the other, you may find yourself furstrated.  But don't let that discourage you - it's a great way to get your brain working and to build up your guts a bit, so I whole-heartedly recommend this game.			"

												As much as I want to recommend this game. I can not. Despite the GlaDoS quotes defintely living up to there potential as in Portal 2, there are extremely minimal of them and they become old very fast. Certain quotes just aren't witty or funny enough and drag out an extra 5 minutes pointlessly. Gameplay lacks as the AI can not calculate simple functions as Identifying a Full House vs a 3 of a kind and may often mistake Full Houses for 3 of a kinds thus making you lose. Also, some hands that you and your opponents get far too good cards to be a coincidence. The chances of you losing can go from an almost certain circumstance to an instant win too often.The aspect of bounties is a pain. Certain bounties are almost unbeatable and render the Item for Team Fortress or Borderlands an extreme waste of time. Such as the Win with a High card as there AI is built to immeditely fold when they do not get anything beyond a pair. The only time this is doable is when you either 1) Get extremely lucky or 2) You get a glitch happen. Either of which will take hours to wait forReview: Despite Quotes being well done, they are minimal and get old.

												I bought this game on a whim but I am definitely glad I did.Telltale Games once again deliver a game full of charm and character and there is little to complain about especially considering the price.This game is in basic a pretty good poker game, it entertains with appealing, crisp visuals and the UI makes play quick and easy. But if you don't especially like poker I wouldn't write this game off. You are joined at the table by Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, CL4P TRP from Borderlands, Ash Williams from Army of Darkness and Sam from Sam and Max. These four characters are packed full of witty and charming dialogue, their conversation and insults keep you very involved in the game and could even entertain you on their own. Each character also has distinct play-styles and always keep you on your toes. Unfortunately the dialogue has the habit of looping which can get extremely dull, most of the jokes stop being funny after about the third time. You might think this game would get fairly boring and inevitably it eventually will but it keeps play interesting with randomised challenges, customizable chips, cards and tables and unlockables for other games. This helps maintain the incentive to win despite being pitted against bots.  Overall it is definitely worth the price, full of charm and life and entertaining on multiple levels but please remember it is a poker game and it's not for everyone.			"

												AYOOO. I seriously am so glad I bought this game. Easily one of the most unique, and amusing, poker games I've ever played. With a plethora of interesting characters like GLaDOS, Brock Samson, Reginald Van Winslow and Ash Williams, this game has a ton of hysterical moments with each character exchanging quips and discussing various topics like personal servitude and job openings. The gameplay itself is fun and always engaging, using features like 'tells' and 'bounties' to create another layer of challenge and play style is beyond awesome. The different felts, decks and chips give you more reason to keep playing and earning fat stacks and the various easter eggs, references and jokes are all pretty clever. This game is also pretty hard to rage about, even when you lose a hand, just because of how utterly likeable and hilarious the characters are. I recommend this game to any poker fan, especially those who also love Evil Dead, the Venture Bros, Portal, Borderlands. By game mechanics alone, this game is great but when one takes into account the creativy and humor behind it, it's amazing. 10/10.			"

												Total garbage as a poker game.The AI is completely absurd and plays like a dumb, drunk novice. It's essentially like playing against a random number generator. Whether the AI calls, bets, raises, bluffs or folds seems to have absolutely nothing to do with its hand or how the other players are playing the hand. It's as if the game was programmed by someone who has never played poker in their life.On top of that, the user interface is terrible and clunky. There's no option to skip dialogue. Although several of the exchanges between the characters are honestly funny the first or second time you hear them, they quickly lose their luster. Especially after you listen to Claptrap or GladOS smack talking you with the same line for the hundredth time after making a completely reasonable and statistically valid call or raise that just turned into bad luck because of a gut shot turn or river card in a hand that the AI had no business being in after the flop. Seriously, the option to skip dialogue would have gone a long way with this game.This game really has no value other than providing a cheap way to acquire some Borderlands 2 and TF2 vanity items. If you absolutely must have the items, then it's a decent buy.... iiiiiif you're willing to invest hours and hours to get the bounties for the item unlocks.If you're looking for a good poker simulator, stay the hell away from this pile.

												You should only buy this game to get the Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 items. Not for actually playing poker.Pros:- Team Fortress 2 items- Borderlands 2 itemsCons:- Unable to skip dialog, thus resulting in an extremely irritating wait while you sit there in silence waiting to finish the hand. Happens constantly!I would only recommend this game if you have $2 laying around. No more. It's not worth it. In fact, I think the designers should pay YOU to play this game since it forces you to sit through the tiring dialog of these other poker players. Seriously, you have time to bake a cake, come back and they would still be talking.After I got the items I uninstalled the game with a smile gleaming from ear to ear knowing that I will never have to play this game again.

												I originally would've recommended this game, but I've lost so many hands because this game can't recognize higher level hands. Every time I've gotten a straight or a flush, it's instead thought I had a 3 of a kind because the person I was up against had a three of a kind and it wanted them to win. This game actively cheats, makes it impossible to win, and is NOT worth the money. Do NOT buy this game. Poker Night 1 is better in every. single. way.			"

												Where do I start?First of all, this is a really bad poker game: dealing hands is clearly not pure chance even though that's how it should be. The computer clearly helps the AI by giving good cards to it in the river most of the time (I tested it just for the heck of it by going for the showdown all the time an at around 80% of the hands the AI won with bad cards by getting help in the river). Because of this Texas Hold'em is basically unplayable as it becomes a luck based guessing game with no strategy involved. Omaha is better so if you really want to see Sam & Max talking trash that game mode is the way to go. The AI itself is pretty bad, it makes stupid decisions while every character has a distinct playstyle that is easy to read. They never change their playstyles, they are always reacting the same way which makes the experience boring.And then there are the so called bounty challenges where completing 3 of them will unlock the chance to compete for one of the character bounties. Some of these challenges are nice and they require a bit of skill to pull off, others are purely luck based with a small percentage being outrageously luck based. This last category absolutely destroys the enjoyment of the game because if you get challenges like ""win a hand with 2 opponents going all in ""or ""win with the higher kicker"" your next move will be to just go and uninstall this mess instead of waiting for circumstances you have no chance of affecting occur. What's even worse is that you can't skip these challenges so if you get a bad 3 you're basically done for.Anyway the atmosphere is pretty cool, the unlockable decorations are nice and the characters are funny but everything gets old quickly. There's also no way to skip repeating jokes so you'll hear the same stuff all the time.Bad, really bad game.			"

												Cheap TF2 items, that's it. Also a few hours of fun. It's also a good game if you want to learn how to play poker, especially Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha, but Poker Night 1 is good for that, too (but only Texas Hold 'Em). All in all, you'll laugh a few times (participants are funny), win a few hands, learn the basics of poker, but this game ends as soon as you get every possible achievement, and you get them very quickly. Maybe the developers should add some more of them.All in all, if you have Poker Night 1 - the only reason you would want to get Poker Night 2 are new unlockables, new characters and a new game - Omaha. Other than that, it's just the very same thing as Poker Night 1.			"

												First off all, this game is a major improvement from the first. The characters are way more interesting, you can buy drinks to accentuate your enemie's ""tells"" and when you buy a full set of cards, chips and table, the Inventory changes style to said set's world. The conversation between the character's is really great, and with the addition of GLaDOS as a dealer, gives you 1 more person that talks. I like the % that each player has in a showdown, giving you an idea of who's winning. To buy additionals, you need tokens, which you always get if you aren't the first to get eliminated. To get the special items for other games, you don't just need to eliminate the person who put it on play, you need to complete 3 challenges then win the tournament. An amazing poker simulator with something to lighten the mood.8/10			"

												I was hoping to learn a little about poker with amusing characters to keep me entertained. What I got was a ruthless, buggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for fans who like to be kicked when they're down. The game has crashed on me repeatedly, and has forced me to restart Steam entirely. The initial back and forth between the characters is amusing, but quickly devolves into repeated dialogue and pointless insults in reponse to player behavior. I actually feel like I know less about poker than when I started. Poker Night is completely worthless.			"

												This game is only really worth it if you want to unlock stuff for borderlands. The AI cheats so badly that you may find it frustrating to unlock anything though. Add to that the fact that you are forced to listen to the same lines from the characters over and over and over and over... you're better off playing the poker that comes free with windows.

												Poker night 2 is a much better sequel to an already awesome game. Poker night 2 has the most random charecters that dont mix at all Claptrap from Borderlands 2, Brock from Venture bros, Ash from Evil dead, Sam from sam and max and Galados from Portal as your dealer. Youre there because you want to play some poker. Now going in its way harder than the first game. Ai will know when youre bluffing or when you get them drunk they will use bad cards in your favour. The gameplay stays the same from the first one. Also the jokes are funny as hell but they do repeat themselfs.  Also they added a new mode which is omaha which is a nice edition but now about the loot. Not only do you get in game loot which looks amazing such as Poker felts, cards and chips but also you get Borderlands 2 skins and also Team fortress 2 items.Overall you have an awesome game which is fun as hell and worth it so go ahead and check it and if youre tight on buget pick this one instead of the first but if you have enought money for both thats awesome so go ahead and check it out i give it a 8.5/10			"

												No multiplayer is a huge downside for any card game involving multiple ""players"". But the witty banter between the iconic characters is enjoyable, I found myself not cutting to the next hand if I was out just so I could enjoy the back and forth. It's also interesting how the graphics for each character remain true to the games they are from, though I did have random frame issues (I run a 7970 and a 4GHz 8 core processor) at times for no apparent reason. Overall, I bought the game for $2.50 cents during the holiday sale and I'm not at all disappointed. Though, any higher I'm afraid I wouldn't be willing to pay simply due to the lack of multiplayer, but anyone that enjoys poker and is a fan of the characters in this game, not minding the lack of multiplayer should have no issue picking this game up.

												I loved the first game, and I love all the characters in this game, honestly some of my favorite. But that doesn't mean the game is god awfully unfair. See, the first game had a plethora of options, including difficulty and ammount of dialog. This game has jack ♥♥♥♥. And it's god awfully unfair AI makes it nearly impossible to win.  If you were a poker playing god the most you could win is every other game. See that's not how I like to play my games. I get that poker is like that in real life, but this isn't real life it's a game and games are meant to be enjoyed thus why the first one had a freaking difficulty option. So even though I love features this game has, I hate the features it doesn't have more.			"

												By far the worst poker game I can imagine, because it is not about poker. Since you cannot skip the overly long, highly repetitive unfunny dialogues, this game is about being tortured by a cruel designer at Telltale.Their older game, Telltale Texas Hold'em, looks a bit dated but at least you can turn off dialogue and mute the remaining voice acts, so everybody shuts up and actually plays poker.

Don't bother with it unless you enjoy hearing the same unskippable dialogue over and over again, and actually have a working knowledge of Texas Hold 'Em.

They talk too much and slow the game down with constant non stop dialogue. after 30 minutes it was not funny and too intrusive to the actual gameplay. The algorithmns seem to reward a certain npc with constant favorable ""God Hands"" and none for you ever. Even when you have good hands you will always be trumped by an npc. And yes there is nothing you can do when an npc with ""God Hands"" keeps buying the pot and going all in.

												Damn you Telltale.  How about making a game that works for a change.  Everybody is having startup issues with all of your games, because you make them all the exact same way and haven't found a way to fix the issue.  I tried every trick to get this game to startup.  The kicker was that once I found a way that got it working, after I closed it and started it up again it wouldn't work.  Each solution would work maybe twice, and then its back to the same old crashing before the telltale logo even comes up.  I was able to get it to start in compatibility with windows 98/ME but then it must store the save file somewhere else when you do that because it made makes you start over.  I started looking to see if I could find where the new save file is placed, but I realized that this game is taking up waaay more of my time than its worth.  I have literally spent 45 minutes starting it up and having it crash on me.  So I no longer expect Telltale games to work, because I have had the same problems with Poker Night 1 and the Walking Dead.  I paid for your games Telltale and you have repeatedly screwed me over.  I have friends who have the exact same problems, and the forums are filled with complaints about them not working but I have seen no remedy on Telltales side.  Don't buy their games.EDIT: After I building a new computer, I figured I'd redownload this game and give it a try.  It works now, but I am refraining from messing with the graphics settings because I'm pretty sure that is what caused the game to malfunction on my other computer.			"

												It's hard for me to properly express how dissapointed I am with Poker Night at the Inventory 2 when comparing it to its predecessor. However, it's not hard for me to point out all of its extremely blatent flaws so I'll cut to the chase.If you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker for fun, move on. If you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker at a simulated friendly table, move on. Now, if you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker at an unfriendly table AND having the computer always stack the deck in favor of the other players, then this is the poker game for you.You are forced to play ridiculously conservatively if you want so much as a chance at winning. Have a pair of kings? The computer gets a pair of aces. You have two pair? The computer gets three of a kind. Bluffing might as well not even exist since even if the computer bluffs with a worse hand than yours, they'll still draw what they need to beat you 80% of the time.On top of feeling more akin to playing a slot machine with two of its reels broken than playing a fair game of poker, this game's dialoge gets grating fast. Most of the longer conversations in the first Poker Night at the Inventory were still about only two thirds as long as some of the drawn out gags in this game. This wouldn't be as bothersome as it is if you could decrease how often characters talk like in the first game, but for seemingly no reason, this and the difficulty option have been removed.In conclusion, if you want to buy a fun single player poker game that feels fair with entertaining characters, buy Poker Night at the Inventory and skip this sadly inferior sequel.

I've had two ""three""s and on the last card drawn recieved another 3 to make 3-of-a-kind. I still lost to the other players who both had ""straights"" despite me being 140k in the hole from previous tournament losses. The game isn't rigged and the dialogue is hilarious. Very enjoyable poker game. Highly recommended.			"

If I want to play poker I will drive one and a half hours to the Hollywood Casino in Columbus Ohio. But I don't gamble. When I play video games on the other hand, poker is just at the bottom of my list of fun. The very bottom. It is still better than point and click games I guess but that's not saying much.			"

												I purchased this because it was dirt cheap and I wanted the TF2 items, but the game is actually a lot of fun, and surprisingly addictive and enjoyable.Sometimes the long dialogue can hold up the game, and make it hard to tell what the other players are doing whilst they talk, but it doesn't happen that often. Also there is a suprisingly large amount of dialogue in the game, so even with you hear the same long piece several times, you can also end up hearing a new piece a few minutes later as well.I would certainly recommend this for anyone who previously hasn't had any interest in poker, or who wants good TF2 items (but wait for a sale if that's the only reason you're buying it).

												I am not really a card player. I roll through the hands just taking my best guess in hopes that chance is on my side but chance has no brain nor can it actually make things happen that won't. Listen to that logic children. Therefore, I usually lose a lot. Overall, I am pleased with the game and the dialog of the characters. After a while you do hear the same things over and over but I would rather have that then no conversation at all. The fact that it is humor kind of makes playing more pleasing. I would say it is worth a buy but maybe not if you are a hardcore poker player who wants a challenge. Afterall, it is a game as far as I am concerned to get a few laughs while playing some casual poker. There are bounties as well that can be unlocked to use in other telltale games so that is a perk as well which keeps you playing. Have fun and lighten up with some ""Poker Night 2"".			"
