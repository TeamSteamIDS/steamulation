												A nice idea but a horrible execution.This game should be fun -- use your cue ball to get the other balls into pits, avoiding obstacles etc.Sadly, this game isn't fun. It looks and plays like an incomplete demo rather than a full game.Controls are keyboard only. You cannot fine-tune shots at all, you just have to hope you somehow get the right angle by mashing wasd or the arrow cluster. Once you start powering up a shot and overshoot your desired power level, you're out of luck -- the only option is to release, shooting the ball, or to let it fill up the bar completely and fire.Every proper shot earns you point, every shot you don't pocket a ball gives you a penalty. Go negative, and the level resets. Whenever you hit an obstacle with your cue ball or a shot ball, you get another penalty.The ball physics aren't realistic at all and, worse, don't seem to be consistent. This makes puzzles incredibly difficult for all the wrong reasons, as you combine bad physics with trial and error.Did I mention that levels fully reset whenever you make a mistake? There is no rewind, there is no undo -- you have to perfectly complete a full level or just start over.Any one of these on its own is forgivable. Combined, they make the game bad and simply not fun.Normally I wouldn't review a game with such a short play time, but this game offers me absolutely no incentive to keep playing. If the first four levels are already incredibly flawed and more frustrating than anything else, I'm not going to sink more time in it.To the dev: add some fine-tuning to controls, if you can't add mouse aiming. Even Peggle has this! Also add a rewind/undo last shot option. When I have to pocket 8 balls and a simple error on the 7th forces a full level reset, it doesn't make me want to play any longer.			"

												When I saw this game my first thought was... I can be a pool hustler now, hanging at the local pool hall, with cigrette smoke filling the air, some rock and roll music soaring through the air...  holding my stick at awkward positions because the scum bag owner decided to put us on the last table... the one that is only about 2 feet away from the wall...  As I'm about to sink the 8 ball in the corner pocket, I lift the bill of my fedora at Angelo as if to tell him... nice try..If you love pool you'll love this game.... is what I thought going in, but this game doesn't have even the most basic of pool physics down.  It takes you all of about 15 seconds to realize the way you hit balls in this game has little to nothing to do with the way you hit balls in real life..I could chalk that up to the fact this is a game and it tries to be challanging.  Don't get me wrong this game has a major challange... the challange of playing the five minutes required to write a review..  I suppose someone out there may enjoy this game, they may buy it and think, WOW, this is awesome.. unfortunately that isn't me... and I'll go out on a limb and say that probably isn't you either.All kidding aside lets get into the meat and potatoes of my reivew...The graphics are ugly, the menu's are laughable in this day and age...  The (pool) physics are broken.. this game has zero redeeming qualities to it. Much like the Grinch who stole christmas.. this game is stink, stank and stunk.			"

												EDIT: the dev commented, but lacks so much confidence, that he didn´t post it as a developer-reply (others would have seen it more easily that way!). i checked his other submissions and all games are horrific and look really bad. you shouldn´t vote for any of his games and save your time and more important, your money!after a really short test:- cheapest possible graphics - the menue is horrific- extremely frustrating system, one error and you have to restart the complete puzzle- no rewind or undo function- physics feel strange (balls behave unexpected, not like real billard)- no way to tell the power (there is a bar, but helps not much)- no way to tell, if there are maximum tries/lifes- looks like done by teenagers in a very short time (not talking about the puzzles)for €3.99 definitely NOT recommended, even for free is overpriced. (edited: not worth anything at all, STAY AWAY from this dev!)			"

												Pool with puzzle elements, seems like a nice combination, right? Well, I guess the idea could be nice if it was well executed, which ""Glow Ball"" sadly does not.I do not have any problem with games that do not have superb graphics but Glow Ball's graphics are amazingly ugly in a way I find it amazing people are able to create these kind of graphics in 2014. Especially the main screen looks atrocious and almost funny.The gameplay could have been interesting. Like in regular pool you will have to shoot your balls in the holes, the only difference here is you will have to avoid fire traps, canyons and other contraptions. The only problem with this is that the physics are nothing like real Pool, which is ofcourse one of the most important things that should be right in a game like this. Then there's the power bar of the cue which is very slow and does not make much of a difference.Overall this is game is a horrible mess that could have been OK if it was better optimised.  "

												Pros:- Music is nice- In-game glowie effect can be pretty, but they butcher it pretty fast with horrible bright green colors after the first level.Cons:- Menu looks like it was done in paintbrush- Control is stiff and slow, it takes forever to 'charge' up your movement which gets really boring really fast.- No mouse control! Verdit: Eventhough the concept is nice the execution is horrible.Lazy half baked game. They could've done so much more with it. "

												EDIT: http://puu.sh/kwJPD/8e34a355b0.png Could say that the dev is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥ http://puu.sh/kBmrX/5640e2fbd7.png And now this. He's just asking for it.This is a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE game. All it takes to make a game horrible is lack of one feature: undo last shot. Let me explain. In this game you have a pool table with obstacles. You got to get a ball in with each shot. Getting a ball in gives 1 point. Hitting one of those red things makes you lose 2 points. Getting your main ball in makes you lose 2 points. You start with 1 point. The second level has 8 balls. You do a bad shot with the last one and you got to start all over again. Third level is even more frustating. The red things spawn randomly. I quit when one of those appeared right in front of me while I was charging my shot. You can't cancel that action. It was certain failiure thanks to that. Oh, and the game looks horrible anyways.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Glow Ball is a game that I can't recommend because:- it's not worth the money- the controls are horrible (you can't use the mouse)- the menu design is awful- the graphics aren't that good- it has no sense- the only good reason to install this game is for the trading cards			"

			The game I played today is called Glow Ball. It's a billiards ""puzzle game"" but the implementation is simply put: poor. The graphics look appealing at first but after a while gets really stale.

												Got it at a 10 key blind buy man even at that price it isn't even worth it.So whats wrong with it.- It says it uses physics but the balls behave so unreal it's pathetic.- one miss basically means start the level all over again. making a shot is 1 point. missing generally is minus 3 or 4 points.- The balls doesn't even seem to roll.- The so called target line isn't even accurate- Can't fine tune shots nor have a different view than top down.- Even the menu look bad.In the end the only positive point I can find is the idea. The idea is solid however the execution of it is just horrible.			"

												10 mins and I was done. not that it matters, but the menu graphic is ridiculously bad and can give you a headache if you stare too long, cannot change controls either but at least they incorporated the arrows (im left handed so wasd is useless to me).As far as the game play goes, good idea, done poorly. I'm not much into puzzles or billard games, I got this from a bundle. I do not like that the level resets if you go negative, which can very easily happen in your first shot. I will not be playing any more of this until they make some much needed changes, and for the love of all that is master race, fix up the menu, its extremely unattractive.edit: just noticed it says partial controller support but this is false, there is no controller support. I am using a 360 receiver with a wireless controller.			"

												OK It's a simplistic billiards type puzzle game: pot all the balls, avoid exploding traps etc.It's kind of fun although very hard but at least you keep restarting on the same level you've reached when you mess up.The trouble is that this is basically like a couple of days' worth of work in Unity and it's being sold as a ""proper"" game. It's not just that this fact offends and annoys me (although it does) but it leads to awkward controls and lack of control over tha ball. You have to use wasd to aim the cueball then hold space for power. The trouble is that all the power settings are pretty feeble except the top one. You have no spin options, it's just direction plus power. Aiming with wasd is pretty hard because the increments it jumps are fairly large, so precise aiming is out of the question. To top it all off the physics resemble no pool physics you ever saw. You are helped by holes which suck down balls like a greedy ball-sucking hole though, so you ""got that going for you, which is nice"".			"

												This game is not fun or interesting.It takes too long to power up your shot.Can't aim as precise as you would want, since you can't use mouse and have to use WASD controls.It's just an extremely basic game of Billiards.Backgrounds are boring and there's no satisfaction in beating a level.Just buy a cheap pool game or play the free one on the steam store if you want to play Billiards, but stay away from this mess.

												I wanted SO badly to be able to spend time with ""Glow Ball""; it's supposedly a puzzle game, which I love playing, and it's beautiful. But unless you are already really, really good at pool you may end up as dissapointed as I am. Yes, the game is fun and colorful, but it is VERY hard. It took all my skills (harhar!) to get past the second level with my near-zero pool experience.  (Offline. I really did try. I hoped my enjoyment of math puzzles might be enough...foolishly, it seems.)In truth, even losing is fun. But since all it takes to lose all progress on a level is one poor shot, fun quickly gives way to frustration as you repeatedly go back to zero. This game would be SO much more fun (and more commercially successful, possibly) if there was an ""easy"" or""beginner"" level where any shot could be undone (much like Radium does, where even failure requires instructions to proceed.) Any chance, DEVs? It would be SO MUCH more fun, not to mention accessible!A feature I really liked, that I'd like to see in every game, is the means to change the music at the press of a button. KUDOS!! (This makes what is already really nice music even better!)The fault is not that of the game or the DEVs (though they might have been more expressive about the degree of difficulty) and I won't give up for good. Therefore, I will recommend the game....IF you are a pool shark already. Who knows, perhaps I can cheat with YouTube, and get past level 3.Thank you. (DEVs - Please consider the ""undo"" feature for people who are more puzzle than pool.)			"
