												This game is far from finished.  Total lack of voice overs and possibly less content.  Sure, hitting the other guy in the face is entertaining, but it's ever so buggy.  No body shots, no blocking properly with gloves, and zero sense of any progression.  Heck, even the fighters are more or less unnamed joes that you just beat up.  The gym has 2 bags that you can punch around.  Gets old quick.  Maybe put a few mini games in there??  How many times in 60 seconds you could hit the speed bag?  Try to hit the ceiling with the heavy bag?  I dunno.  Something to spice up the gym a little.For the price, I'm not too bummed out, but I still think there should have been a bit more to this before releasing.  If this had a bit more of a story to it, allowed body shots,  gave some sort of sense of progression and had a few bugs ironed out, then I would probably rate this very well.  Until then, I'm afraid I must give it a thumbs down.This bug below is so bad, it's impossible to lose a fight since they can't hit you:

												I really don't get it why so many of these VR experiences / games get so many positive reviews compared to the amount of negative reviews. Yea I get it, VR is cool. Most of these games just really seem like a less than a gamejam amount of time and less effort on a video game. Don't say that the games are good if the tech is good/cool.Atleast this was priced accordingly, so I wouldn't bash it too much, but also wouldn't expect nothing from it. Boxing itself was fun, it was like a tech demo for Wiimotes. Everything else in this game wasn't enough to slide under the average quality of VR games and its pretty sad since the bar seems pretty low.			"

												The game is so unfinished that I was amazed that this is not an early access game. You can only punch your opponent in the face and.. You basically just have to wiggle your arms (controllers) really fast in front of your opponents face, and you will knock him down in about 5 seconds from the start, every time!! I've tried with many opponents and the end result is always the same.Another crazy detail is that you have to wait 15 seconds every time before the round begins. It is not a big deal, but when you do this over and over again in every round, it really starts to eat away your motivation to play the 5 seconds that the round will last..Great idea, but that is all there is.

												Graphicly this game is ok. But gameplay wise the thrill of the fight blows it out of the water!! during matches i try bodyshots and blocking bc i'm used to it but it just doesn't work. the guy punches through your hands wtf. you hit him twice he goes down. that's no fun at all. The gym looks nice but for that reason alone i can't recommend this game.			"

												Hello, EveryoneI thought this game was pretty fun and got a pretty good workout in it. I Box in real life and it was fairly realistic, as must as a VR Boxing game can be. I do wish they would let you hit the body, I like hitting the body a lot but I cant in this game.If you like check out my Video Gameplay Here:

												Lots of potential here! Physics feel good. Body shots need to register but head shots, punching bag, heavy bag all feel great. A.I. is way too easy but its early. Make it more difficult, change up the opponents looks. Maybe add some slow mo replays in addition to the previous suggestions and I think this game rocks and is worth much more!			"

												Boxing saga is alright, however, the fighters you fight still need work = aiI kept fighting the same boxer over and over even though I beat him every time - and the game crashed twice and in turn it crashed steamvr with it - still needs work. One match I lost a punching hand and still won with one hand - bugs!Teleporting in the gym is very sensitive - one time I ended on the ceiling somehow! When you practice in the gym punching leads you to press the the big button centre button on the motion controller sending you places you don't want to go to.I like the graphics - feels like you're fighting on TV.However, the Thrill of the Fight still feels far more superior as an actual proper boxing game - it just works and is a better work out.

												At first, I did not realise the boxers got any harder (after you win, it throws you back to the gym and there is no indication of having progressed). But I soon realised the scoreboard reflects your progression well-enough. It would have been nice if it transported you in front of the scoreboard after a match. Nonetheless, if you keep going back into the ring, your opponents get better and better. I used to do Zen Do Kai (freestyle karate) and I found it reminiscent of upper-body sparring. Because I am quite tall (6,3""), I rarely got to spar with someone the same height as me so it was nice to have that in VR. I do like being able to warm-up with the easier opponents at the beginning. The speedball could be tweaked a little to swing more freely and then you could build up some really nice momentum; mini-game potential right there. That aside, I liked the dynamics of the gameplay better than Thrill of the Fight (to be fair, I bought them both at the same time, tried them out -briefly- before refunding TotF). Even though you can only hit your opponents in the head, for me, this was the clear winner.  Overall, the gameplay delivered a great punch and I look forward to adding this to my daily fitness routine.			"

												Not a bad first release.  Not very realistic in terms of physics - a flurry of baby taps with an extended arm wins everytime.  But still exhausting fun for a few matches.  Effort into audiance poor - same 3-4 people repeated.			"

												Isn't great but has its moments. I like how there are a punch of opponents to take on, even though they all look almost the same. The Thrill of the Fight only had one at the time I played it. I also like that you can work the heavy bag or speed bag. The speed bag doesn't work how it would in real life though. If you're a boxing fan and looking for a good boxing simulator in VR then this probably won't do it for ya.

												To be clear, I found it hard to click the ""yes"" button with regards to being able to recommend this game. It's by all accounts shallow, silly and lacks any semblence of realism or overall effort. If you're looking for a boxing sim, or something with some substance, I recommend passing it up.That being said, I knew all of this before I hit the purchase button thanks to some honest reviews, not that the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥translations or gameplay videos themselves didn't give it away. I bought it anyway because I thought what the hell, it's $5 and looks like a decent arcade experience. What you get is an endless wave of completely stupid AI with canned animations, unrealistic mechanics, but an addictively fun time knocking dudes out every minute or two. I found myself laughing at the different combinations I could slap together with the final killer hook, straight or uppcut making the AI go limp. With regards to the actual mechanics, it's stupid enough to go as far as holding down the trigger while you punch to provide a power shot. You would think with VR, power shots would be determined by...power. Body shots are non-existent. Blocking is non-existent. Sometimes the hit box for the AI's head won't even register, seems to be related to certain animations. Movement might as well be non-existent because the enemy is glued at a fixed range from you and floats right with you if you cover any distance over a couple feet from your starting position. Still though, I'm entertained and it's yet another game to get the heart rate up, if only moderately. Only buy it if you have $5 to♥♥♥♥♥♥away and think punching dudes unconscious with haymakers over and over and over and over and over is something you might get a little joy out of. If you want an actual attempt at an in-depth boxing experience, and more importantly one that has a bright potential future with a developer who is constantly updating it, check out Thrill of the Fight. That game is superior to Boxing Saga in every way imagineable.			"

												The Boxing its self is alright but this is definatley not a finished game and should have been released as early access or a tech demo. Most anoying thing about the game is that you cant hit to the body. If that was added it would much better.Shame really cause if this game was updated more, it could potentially be really good cant recommend it though in its current state though. Feedback from a Rift user: Rift Cameras are all over the place so if you have a small room can be hard to align yourself up to the opponent. Would be useful if the touch controller sticks were activated to give the user an option to adjust their position manually. (At least having the options in the settings would be nice.) "
