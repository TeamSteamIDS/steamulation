												Soccertron is a competitive sports game in which you either play vs. bots or play against (or with) up to 3 other players (locally). There are 5 different types of rounds (game modes) which have some similarities with real sporst like; Basketball, Volleyball and football (No, I won't call it 'soccer'!). The gameplay is fun and works nicely but a controller is highly recommended. The main problem with the game is that it's very minimalistic. There simply isn't anything to keep you entertained in the long run.The bots (on the highest difficulty) may seem like tough opponents untill you figure them out. The 5 gamemodes are fun for a while but get boring pretty quick. There's no online multiplayer.You could ofcourse try to beat every achievement, which are very easy (Lose 200 times for example) but simply take a hell of a lot of time.Overall 'Soccertron' is a fun game IF you can find some friends to play locally otherwise I doubt you find this one interesting enough to keep playing.

												Soccertron looks to capture the magic of awesome party games such as Nidhogg, Sportsfriends and Towerfall.It has that simplicity and easy approachability. Yet is difficult enough that it does require a bit of skill.The game does boast quite a bit of extra goodies. Steam Achievements/Cards, Full controller support. Decent AI Opponents.The only thing that is missing from the game is multiplayer. Which the developer has already stated is planned and coming in the future. When and if that does arrive. It will take Soccertron to the next level!In the meantime, enjoy this couch party game that is bound to be full of chaotic cheers and jeers.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

			Time for some simple and fun party style action! In Soccertron you can play with up to 4 players in several game modes. From Pittron, where you chip away at your competitors floor.		

I hope you enjoy!Martyr			"

												This seemingly primitive multiplayer entertainment managed to surprise me - it turned out to be a cute singleplayer fun as well! If you remember DOS times you might recall the game 'Arcade Volleyball' (1987) which was very popular as a casual time killer. 'Soccertron' is obviously a creative developement of that idea - several 'sports' added along with modern physics engine and neon graphics. Bots are smart and persistent, tricky situations arise every second and after you get used to character motion (much more sophistiicated than predecessor's) and controls the emotions flow like a river!Это на первый взгляд примитивное многопользовательское развлечение удивило меня, оказавшись также прикольной одиночной забавой! Если помните времена ДОС, то, вероятно, вспомните игру ""Волейбол для автоматов"" (1987), которая была весьма популярна в качестве случайного убийцы времени. ""Соккертрон"" однозначно является творческим развитием той идеи - добавлены новые ""виды спорта"", а также современная физика и неоновая графика. Боты хитры и настырны, сложные ситуации возникают каждую секунду, и после того, как привыкнешь к движениям героя (гораздо более навороченным, чем у предшественника) и управлению, эмоции текут рекой!

												First of all, I would like to mention that I started off hating this game because of it's controls, but then I started using a controller and WOW the change was dramatic. The game is so much better with a controller, it feels way more natural and less awkward to control. Instead of being a game of skitterish squirrels skating on slippery ice, it became a tight and easy to manuever elite soccer game. I really love this game now and so do my friends. This game requires skills and lots of luck, but it is really fun!Would definitely recommend :D			"

												Great party game. A tournament of this game can get pretty heated in a moment, with everyone dashing and punching and praying for the ball to enter the goal. Its easy to get the hang of, so people not used to play games will surely have fun too.			"

												Simple and fun. It works either with friends or solo, as you can summon up to three AI members. Unfortunately however, the AI is set to a standard difficulty and struggles with certain game types, one of which it can barely play at all. AI also becomes a bit of a breeze as you gain some experience, making the ""You lost 250 matches"" achievement a painful grind for solo players (prepare to intentionally lose a LOT of games). Aside from those issues it's a delight to play either alone or with friends. It controls and performs well, is easy to learn so you can jump into action, and has a pretty interesting neon-esque art style.I highly recommend using a controller for this title, and note you can use the left analog stick to direct the ball's trajectory before you kick it (I didn't figure that out initially). If you're looking for bursts of fun for maybe 5-15 minutes at a time I suggest you give Soccertron a go. Just take note that for the price you might only manage 1-3 hours of gameplay as that seems to be the medium, but if you or your friends enjoy it, I anticipate roughly 8-10 hours of game time in getting all achievements.

												A competent game lacking in any depth. The game is complete and works but it just doesn't have enough to keep things interesting. I'd personally like a little more directional and strength control with the hits but the gameplay is indeed tight and makes sense. Controller support is rightfully there and works. Visuals and atmosphere work too. For me, two of the five game modes just didn't pan out competitively or fun at all. And the other three modes work but desperately need more substance of some sort. I'm not against a simple tight game by any means, as gameplay always outweighs everything else in my book. But there just wasn't anything below the surface. Something as simple as some modifiers would extend the shelf life a hundred fold. Adjustable scores, rules, anything. And two or three different stadium layouts for each mode certainly wouldn't hurt either.As it stands the game just plays itself out far too quickly. I'm a big fan of local versus and can make flipping a coin competitive with real life adversaries so Soccertron will of course be capable of delivering some fun. But there is just plain better options. Being a bundle toss-in was the right way to obtain it and I can't really recommend it much beyond that.			"

												This game looked like a lot of fun, but due to the gameplay it just isn't. It sort of reminded me of the oldschool game Slime Volleyball, and it seems like it's heart is in the right place, but it just isn't that good.I wish I had some constructive criticism for what could be done to make it better. I'd start with the physics- it's just too frustrating to try to hit the ball. On top of that it's way too hard to aim and get it into the goal. I thought volleyball was alright, but after trying it again I've decided that I don't think that's a redeeming quality either- once you lose one point, you're almost guaranteed to lose 2 or 3.If I had to say something good about Soccertron it's that the menu system is easy to navigate. However, the game mode selection interface is too in-your-face big.I'm sorry, but I would have to say to avoid this game.On a sidenote, I tried letting the computer play against an idle player and thought it was funny that the idle player won one of the games.

Soccertron has cool ideas, but ultimately needs a bit of work in the physics and control department. I love couch co-op and versus, which is why I picked up this cheap title. Its fairly simple, there are several sports to play a la two or four-player style (1v1 or 2v2 volleyball, soccer, basketball, etc.). The problem is that it is very difficult to control the ball and actually be *good* at it.We did not play all that long, but it was clear this was the case. There is more button-mashing than anything, really.Pros:+Its cheap and has some cool ideasCons:-Physics is wonky enought that makes it really difficult to have control and not button-mash-Side-view sports are not really that fun, IMO-While there are several game modes - they all play out the same-No character customization or anything, just lots of neon colorsI got it for half price, and still have buyer's remorse.

												TLDR, here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Music is better than♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- Graphics are above 8 bit (except for the background)- Statistics- Fullscreen support- Ability to change volume and resolution- 5 game modes- 1-4 player support- It says it is version 15.05.15, so they must update it a lot (although the game must have either been abysmal at v1 or the version updates must have been something like ""changed slider colors from slightly dark white to extremely light gray"")Cons:- 0 of the game modes are good (there is actually 1 game mode that is good, but it is one that I made up with friends because of a major flaw in one of the actual game modes)- Tons of gimmicks to easily win at most of the modes- Annoying objects make any ""would have been a great shot"" turn into a ""oh ♥♥♥♥, it just deflected into my own goal"" - Aiming is hard as ♥♥♥♥- You can't change anything else- The game is entirely luck based- The characters in this game should really be snails, cause that is about how fast you move relative to the ball- The AI are ♥♥♥♥ing godlike- No online multiplayer, althought it isn't like anyone would be using it if there was.- Last but not least, please look at steam charts and see how few people play it. There is a very good reason why the most players EVER on at once is exactly 4.- http://steamcharts.com/app/334620 "

												This is really cool !!! I couldn't care less about sports, but this is a good little local multiplayer to put on your laptop, and it won't bog down your system with tons of memory . It's perfect the way that it is, and doesn't need anything . The jet pack jumping action, and the neon look give it a sci-fi flavor . It plays just fine on my Windows 8.1 system .

I ended up getting too good though and we stopped playing. Definitely worth the money considering I have probably played 15 hours.			"
