								Even though it is in Early Access, the game is fun thats for sure. The art in general is quite cute and funny and the movement is simple (with only movement keys and two buttons to do everything).There are still a few problems that takes away considerable amount of fun out of the game though:1-) There is no off-side which can be exploited and weakens the experience of the game in general.2-) AI is weird and for both sides. The auto switching of the player chooses the sub-optimal targets, the enemy team freezes up and doesn't move (in friendly matches) etc.3-) Player movement. When I select a player, it keeps on moving on its own for a while and it makes you really angry when your player moves away from the ball because some AI code decided that its the best decision for the ""chosen"" player.4-) Pass button used for precise shooting. The game sometimes decides that there is a player right next to you so you should use pass option instead of shooting, even though you're literally face to face with the enemy goal keeper.There are a few other problems but all in all the game is a fun experience for those who don't want to deal with all the buttons and technicality of soccer while playing the game.

								Good game. The gameplay is simple and very enjoyable. The sounds and musics are great.Lots of teams, stadiums and competitions, including women teams/competitions!Few things lacking:-Annoying to have the player target the corners when he is 20cm away from the goal line.-Maybe changes/tiredness of players would be nice (could be an optional setting).-Maybe also more variation in the gameplay, adding some tricks.-Fix shots/passes? So easy to score on easy, on medium/hard against a good team it's really hard to score from close unless you shoot at max power. Passing the ball front of the goal is really hard too as passes rarely go straight to the player you want and you can't smash it mid-air. So possibly making more precise passes OR allowing some special shots front of the goal would help the gameplay.Overall good game, it would still get a good note from me if it was released now.Edit: Edited my review, i think the overall difficulty is fine, the problem are shots/passes.

ReviewI love football/soccer games. I started playing them in the '80s. The first one was Soccer for Mattel Intellivision, but the ones that really sucked my time were: Microprose Soccer (used to play on a CGA monitor with no colors), Fifa '94 and Striker '96.I really miss these old arcade games. Now Pixel Cup Soccer 17 and Kopanito All-Stars Soccer are here to fill my emptiness =)Pixel Cup Soccer 17 has been released in Early Access recently, but already has a lot of content.The game has 8 competitions, including: Men/Women Olympic Game, Men/Women World Cup and Euro 16.You can choose between 3 different weather conditions: Wind, Sun and Rain.There a lot of different stadiums.You can choose the speed of the game: Slow, Normal, Fast and Super Fast.Three difficulty settings: Easy, Normal and HardIt's very easy to play and you need only two buttons. There are no fouls, cards or offsides.You can't change the team's formation or change the tatics.The developers are very active on the Steam Forum and on their Twitter page.Currently the game has no online multiplayer, only local. They intend to implement it, but first they are porting the game to Unity and so they'll start working on the online multiplayer.The goal keeper is computer-controlled only, but they intend to make human-controlled also.So far I haven't found a game-breaking bug, but I have seen a strange behavior from the AI: they stopped running with the ball once they got closer to my goal keeper. But I read on the Forum that the AI is being reworked.Pros:
Arcade.Fast pace (or not, it's your call).Easy gameplay (only two buttons).Achievements.Controller Support.16-bit nice graphics.Suggestions/Cons
Options to control the volume: the music and the FX.Online multiplayer. No ETA because they are porting the game to Unity first.Automatic player switch needs improvement. Sometimes the game switchs to a player far from the ball.Defense needs improvement. The players seems to run away from the ball.The pass button as a precision shot needs to be reviewed. You don't know when the game will pass or shoot the ball when your close to the goal.Players look all the same, just different colors.It would be nice to have a ""Random stadium"" option.Rating:9/10For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

								The Uruguayan still bites!  This game has balls. Early access, yet so many details in animations and overall gameplay, so many international tournaments available already (even women). Good, nostalgic gameplay for everyone. Just minor tweaks, editor tool, career, online mode and we have a complete product. Probably the best alternative football game if you can't stand FIFA and PES anymore. Lionel and Alien are waiting for you.			"

								There's some really good indie soccer games on Steam at the moment and PCS17 looks like being another one. I'm a huge fan of the old Arcade Football games like Hattrick Hero so this game was an obvious purchase. The game is very young in it's development but it's already very fun to play. There's bugs and glitches in the game, but that's to be expected really. I'm looking forward to seeing this game develop. Also important is this is very much a proper game right now. There's multiple tournaments, game modes, match settings and more.			"

Also it is great that they include a linux version, thank you.I like everything in this game, it's presentation is neat, playability is good, UI is clean, etc.The only thing that I don't like it is the '17 in the title, I assume that it will be like FIFA or PES, having a lot of numbered games, besides that, the game is a good one to try.

								I love this game.  Of the 1k plus games I own this is one of the very few that I keep going back to.  I neither own the rig nor have the money to buy and run FIFA or PES so Pixel Cup is the only soccer game I have but it fills the bill just fine.  I love being able to continue my World Cup status one game at a time and it's easy to pick up and put back down.  Even if you didn't pick it up while it was in an Indie Gala bundle it's totally worth getting.  Just make sure you have a gamepad as I don't think playing with a keyboard would be nearly the same experience.			"

								Very fun game, playing this game brings out nostalgic feeling... it's remind me to the era when games are so simple and fun, and that's why it's called.. a Game (something that makes you having fun). As a consequences, several standard football events are omitted in this game. There were no fouls, no offside, no diving, no injury and no injury time. It is just a core of football tailored to make you play, laid back and laugh.The game provides three difficulty levels: easy, normal and hard. Just choose the hard difficulty if you want an extra challenge.			"

								A bit Sensible Soccer, a bit Tsubasa and mix of old games. It would be awesome with controller support and multiplayer and I believe they will add some new features after early access process.Pixel Cup Soccer 17 is really fast paced soccer game when compared with old NES games but It's not negative. We get used to fast tempo and It's better. Also, there are nice game modes like friendly fluent competitions. As I said, party mode is good but you should play on same keyboard, like old days. Game would be better with multiplayer.Graphics are also good and retro style. If you are aged gamer or a person who miss old days and if you are bored because of same cycle of the PES and FIFA, give it a try.At least, I assure you this game is better than PES 2016!			"

Early Access Review
Too flawed to be recommendedArcade style games with simplistic mechanics follow a certain set of rules. Normally these rules are easily graspable, even though they may differ from reality - they are still rules. Pixel Cup Soccer 17 was supposed to be finished by now (it still says it will be finished at the end of last year in the EA description), but is still suffering from major gameplay and consistency issues.You basically just need one player to cross the entire field, even on hard, because you just run in zig zag a little and the opponent will miss their tackles until you are alone in front of the goalkeeper (and you can do the same to them as well).Goalkeepers are aliens. There is almost no way to get past a goal keeper on medium or hard with normal shots - at least not to my knowledge. Very rarely will you be able to charge up a shot so hard (and aim at the goal properly) to be able to score, because the keepers have the reaction time of a rat on acid and will no-frame parry all shots from closer range, no matter how well aimed. To me this is a very lazy design choice to make up for the problem described in 1).The controls are wonky at best. The way players turn, the way they tackle, how fast you recover after some tackles resulting in you immediately shooting the ball to oblivion, because tackle and shoot are on the same button and you have no reaction time to lift your finger after the tackle, the way tacklings for a header work, the way aiming and shooting works, it all feels very unpolished and weird.A ball doesn't have to cross the line to be considered ""behind the line"". I literally scored a goal by shooting the ball along the goal line (and it went back out off the post, in no reality instance should this be a goal as long as we're talking about football / soccer). No offside, no tactics, no fouls, no team management, no customization (yet). There is basically no variety, no depth. I expect a little more from a 2017 PC game, even though it may be a casual arcade title.Repitition. Due to the problem stated above, the game becomes very dull in no time. The only differences between games are different stadiums, some weather effects and different team colors / players with mildly varied overall stats (which you cannot look into individually per player, but only per team, even though each player seems to have individual stats). Having plenty of different modes does not help that the game is absolutely the same every time, the only variation being the penalty shootout mode (which, as you may have guessed, becomes repetitive very fast).In conclusion...With a little less fancy graphics and a lot worse sound (because that's definitely a plus side of Pixel Cup Soccer 17), this may have been one of those handheld arcade things you are gifted at your local fast food chain of choice in the kid's meal. It just has a tiny bit more variation in style, not really in gameplay. And I think even those handhelds would offer more consistency in their mechanics and controls.So far this to me (especially considering the presumed completion date of ""within 2016"") is a disappointment and too expensive at 10â‚¬/$. Maybe give it another couple of months, but I have my doubts. The only thing making this more enjoyable could be multiplayer. Then it can probably a decent pick up for you and your adolescent family members. No online multiplayer yet though.			"

 Review In a world swamped with endless FIFA games, that are the same basic game over and over again with a fresh lick of paint, it is just a sheer joy to play a football title like this.For those that remember the Super Nintendo release day line up, this is very much a side-scrolling Super Soccer, with the mode and content diversity of ISS Deluxe. Such a good start to a game in alpha.Fun, fast and easy to play, but with challenging opponents, and just crammed with charm. The stadiums are well envisioned, and I love the pixel parodies. Sorry for the spoilers, but loading up my first game to see, no less, than Freddy Mercury, Wheres Wally/Waldo, Stan Lee, Fred Durst, a Xenomorph, and many other caricatures of well-known personalites and fictional characters.Such a fantastic start to Pixel Cup Soccer 17, retro lovers rejoice! Suggestions } As much as I love the two button NES style, making it a four button SNES style would allow for a manual tackle jump/dodge button, and an alternative tackle (sholder, push etc).} Control over the goalies kicks, a choice between a long lob and a near pass would be great.} General improvement for Keeper AI, not that it is terrible, it needs a little tweaking.} A ref sprite. Seriously, a fat referee character dressed in all black would make my day. And maybe make him distracted or sleepy at times, so you can foul when he's not looking.} Cards for bad tackles, 2 strikes a player is out (yellow then red). No other penalties though, such as offside etc.} Maybe change the menu format? I don't mind but the Mobile Phone Port look may turn people off.} Injuries and substitutions, automatically handled. A low chance per tackle of a player getting too injured to play.} Option for random weather and time conditions.} More of the same! Really is a breath of fresh air to see such a football game out there. Great initial Steam release!			"

								All this game needs is a Multiplayer feature. Now if you could work on that, this would be a very nice Indie Soccer game that'll definitely become popular in no time for those looking for nostalgia of that sort. A few other things you might want to consider adding, is perhaps a set of skills. Some players can curve the ball (more than how it is now), some have powerful shots, etc. Adding a bunch of ""abilities"" would be indeed unrealistic, but it would be so much fun.			"

What you get is a fast paced  game with mens and womens teams, lots of Leagues and Cups to win with Teams of different skill levels and  tough Goalies to get passed. So if your looking for a fun footie game with great graphics and game playability this is the one to get and for Â£6.99 its well worth it. 10/10.			"

The controls are very responsive, and the players do exactly what you want them to...exactly when you want them to. There are female and male Footy players, so your sister or girlfriend (I hope those are two different people) can lose against you with a sprite wearing a sports bra. This game gives you a lot as is...and according to the road-map, there is much more to come. Even non Soccer fans will have a fun time with this game. They have captured an old-school look and also an old-school game mentality. Easy to learn, fun to play, hard to master. "

								Was looking for a 'soccer fix' a decided to download this game, as there is no FIFA on Steam. I chose  Pixel Cup Soccer primialry because it reminded me of ""Sensible Soccer""Turns out, the 20 year old game (made in 1996?)  is far more better that this, 2017  game.Mechanic are very simplistic, which is ok. For game like this it should be. However, in order for simple mechnics to play well, it needs to work well . Good- Shooting at the goal is a bit cluncky, but ok, considering it is an early access game.  There si a ""precision shot"" that sort of manages direction you want to shoot at. But , you can do voley shots or anythgin similar.- Passing is ok too. You can to long passes, which are bit clunky to execute.  You can do ""lob passes"" but again, these feel just like they are  there for sake of it, as both long pass and lob passes are usless when you have no diea wher you player are.- Music is good. An old fashion 8bit- Sound Effectes are avarage, but again not badand thats  it.Bad- Overal Gameplay .There is no sense of tactic or depth  in a game. You can't atack from the left, for example,  do a center shot and have a striker  do the  header. I am not talkign abotu FIFA style action here. Just simple stuff with basic meahcnics.   Sensible Soccer in 1990s did this.   - Game just feel dull after few tournamets . On second run I reached the semi final. Granted I played with best team (Argetina) but stilll..it feels easy once you figure out the flaw in meachnics. - It also feel difficult where it shouldn't be. Diffculty increases as your pogress not as per players/team profile. Scoring a goal in a final is a miricle, but not because of a gameplay. You can run across the field and reach a goal. but geting pass the golie is a mircale- Penaties.. I got into penatly mode after drawing in a game , mind you there was no ""Sudden death"". So after 45 in 2nd quarter i just got trasnfered to penatlies.  It was worst penatly shootout I ve seen implemeted in a game.- Oh yeah, In exact 45:00 the game will stop. I had a shot on a goal in last secodfs  and it bounced of a golie. iwas abotu to shoot at athe goal.  Peeep. End of a 1st half. - No fauls. No offsides. No extra times. No isdden death. No subs. No tactics. No players profile. Nothing. This all really make game to fall flat and with no depth. Replaybility is down to zero....as  there is no incentive  to play again. There is no league play  just tournament play (Euro and World Cup)  which is like  8 games. After few Tournamnets (an hour or so)  you will be bored.Overal, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor game. I undesrtand it is in Early Access but common. put a bit more effort. Not worth 10$, Not even 1$. 0.99 maybe. "

								This game is fun.  Stupid fun, that is.  It reminds me of the soccer games of the early 1990s on sega.			"

								Indeed such a great little game, reminds me of my childhood like so many others, Sensible Soccer on the PC.  Plus this week Free App of the Week for the Apple App Store.  Well done the makers.The only down side is I have 39% of the Achivements after only playing for about 1.6 hours, hope fully updates brings more.			"

								It's a fantastic game of soccer. Reminds me a bit of the Mega Drive (Genesis) days of Fifa. I really love the music and the style. So if you like arcade soccer, 16bit music and graphics I'd say give it try. I really enjoy this and it's also competitive against friends			"
