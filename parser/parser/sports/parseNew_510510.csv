												WWE 2K17, to me, is what WWE 2K15 should have been, This is truly the next gen WWE game. A plethora of grappling situations, situational taunting,  improved table combat, wonder character creation. This is the WWE game you need you need to play._______________________________________________________________________________Pros_______________________________________________________________________________Seamless transitions to back stage fighting (finally)Crowd fightingSituational TauntsElimination of taunt spamming for momentumPlethora of new combat situations, you can now use springboard finishers for example.Table combat is vastly improved.Removal of superstar renders eliminating the jarring experince of having your obviously created character look like♥♥♥♥♥♥in wrestler select screens and loading screens, now everyone uses an in game modelThe music (highly Subjective)_______________________________________________________________________________Meh      _______________________________________________________________________________Changes to Universe mode. You have to go through the show intro each week.Ladder changes... why? Ladder matches were fine as is, there was no need to change them. (Subjective)_______________________________________________________________________________Cons_______________________________________________________________________________The promo engine. There is no way to see the best choice, or even to see the intent of waht you plan on saying. I can pick "" I look great"" thinking its a heel line and it comes out ""I look great, but not in comparison to you lovely folks"" a obviously face statementRemoval of game modes, why was triple threat FCA removed? That makes no sense.Where is the weapon wheel for some match types? Removed for no reason, they finally make tables useful and they go and remove the weapon wheel from matches that previously had it.Paying for dlc. What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong wwith you 2k? I would have no problem paying for dlc if the pc port was released when the console versions were, but you make us wait 5 months then make us pay for dlc._______________________________________________________________________________Should you buy this game? If you don't mind the dlc practices, buy it. Its the best WWe game released since 2014. "

 WWE 2K17 for PCAn amazing wrestling experienceWhile 2K15 was a disapointment for a lot of people, 2K16 was a big step in the right direction. 2K17 on the other hand, is a lot better than both of them. They have learned from many mistakes.  Positive:   Big roster.  Improved career mode, with Promos.  Creating your own wrestler with infinite options. You could even create yourself.  You can create your own Stages,  Creation of custom titles. Backstage Brawls The gameplay improved overall. Feels more natural and more responsive.  A lot of things to unlock. A lot of gamemodes The universal mode is even better than it used to be.  Online and local multiplayer. You can upload and download user created wrestlers. Tons of moves AJ Styles :) Neutral:   Some of the animations can look weird.  Decent, but not great graphics. Especially the audience. Does not look like a game from 2016-17.  Glitches. I'm putting them on the Neutral section, because they can lead to hilarious moments.  Negative:   Some people are experiencing performance issues. (I have an I5 and a GTX970, everything runs smooth for me only a few FPS drops) Entrances are locked at 30FPS Came out later than the console versions and does not include all DLC's (Like it usually does).  VERDICT:   WWE 2K17 is one of the best(Maybe even the best) wrestling game I have played. They have improved a lot of things.  My final score is a 85/100 Thanks for reading. Feel free to comment.

												Much Much Better Than Last Year But..........So I preorder this game and I waited this long to give this game a fair enough review so I will be going over some of the litte details I notice.A.I and Mechanics: This is where the game shines I played on Legend difficulty and the new taunt system gives you the feel of a game that has shed away from it's failed past experiments (2k15/2k16).  The A.I for example if your playing a normal 1 vs 1 match; with a Face vs Heel match and are beating the bad guy up too much. They may get out the ring grab a weapon from underneath the ring and hit you with it purposely DQ'ing themsevles from the match (Nice). The taunt system is more useful and fun to use and they brought back the wake up taunt from 2k14 (Thank You). The Charge finisher remains in the game and you are allow to perform more than 4 taunts (20 or more or so) I use xbox controller so yeah sorry I can't be more direct for you keyboard players.... Matches and Modes (Offline): There is no showcase mode in this game but that is probably why the game is much better than 2k16. What I'm saying is the MyCareer mode has some new things this year like the promo system. This promo system gives you the ability to have a RPG setting in choosing your dialogue. Other modes in game like Universe mode shares this same function and have more better details like the reversal system.Online Modes 2K Tonight/WWE Live: 2K Tonight mode is much polish this year and this is the mode you would play if you want a fair match with no custom movesets or custom wrestlers. WWE Live mode is the only mode I play because of the ability to use your created wrestler and edited movesets. I like to edit my wrestlers moveset because I mostly play Universe mode on Legend difficulty and some wrestlers moves changes in real life.Random Question: Should I buy this game? Me: This game is fun but I notice the price is much higher than last years 2k16 deal. However this game release this month (February) and not in March so you have to consider that maybe the reason why so pricey.Random Question: I have a friend who bought this game and they are having problems with Framerate drops and such any ideas why?Me: I had similar problems with my game after I installed it and I have an Nvidia graphics card. I even went into my Nivida control panel settings to make sure all my games were using the Nivida card and not the standard video card and still I was experience framerate drops. So I just rebooted my pc so the game is in sync with the video card driver hope this helps.Random Question: No he tried all of that....Me: Well..... He better hope 2K patches the game up because that is mostly the reason.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*2K Games please focus on hiring voice actors for MyCareer mode and Universe mode because the promo system is a good idea but it's useless and boring after awhile reading all the $hit. Showcase mode should NOT be in the base game you should only include that mode as a DLC or integrate Showcase mode in Universe mode because we could careless about the replay value because that mode doesn't have any unless your really bored and don't have online......

												The game is well done and all, and it's certainly better, mechanically, than the last, but...There's an audio glitch in this game that remains unfixed, and that I have no idea how to fix myself, because the most common answer on the forums is 'ignore it.' That being, in MyCareer or Universe mode, whenever the show starts, it plays the unbelievably annoying 'logo' noise over and over and over. It grates on my nerves endlessly, and kills a lot of my enjoyment to the degree that I just don't want to play it anymore. Until that gets fixed, thumbs down from me.			"

												It is a good game, mechanically, and it is an improvemnt over the last game in terms of options for moves and animations etc. You can do cool things with the tables etc.However, the matchmaking is exactly the same, to a point where it feels liek they are trolling. God knows why there is no option to just simply search of ANY game, instead of having to choose a specific game, and hope that somebody else selects the same game mode. 3 years in a row of ShXtty matchmaking is unacceptable.Many glitches in the game that cause frequent crashes during online play. So it's another lazy port by 2K. There's just no excuse for it other thank laziness. If they want people to buy the game, they need to make the effort to have a better product than this.Keeping this as negative until they sort out the above.			"

WWE 2K17I played from WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2006 through 2K17 and here are the features I'm missing in the gamePros:Slight graphical improvements every year.Taunt system.My Career mode more immersive.WWE games on PCPromos I like the Idea but where are the voices ?ConsBring back the old GM mode please.Missing alot of various match types like Inferno, Buried alive match etc.Not able to use your own music for enterance.Not able to create your own Finisher.No storylines wich alot of people buy the game for.Game optimization from console to pc could use more improvements.DLC is not free while we waited months and months to be able to play on PC.This what I could think of at this moment. I do recommend the game if your a WWE fan.			"

												I like 2k17. It's one of my favorite games to play a few rounds in when I go over to my friend's house who has a PS4.This is not 2k17.This is a laggy, processor hogging, crashing, unoptimised monster of a game.Now let me be clear, it's not as bad as it could be. There are parts of it that work fine. The charachter creator? Smooth as silk. The move selector? Never drops below 60. But the actual GAME? When there are two people fighting each other? That's just embarrasing.My machine can run The Witcher 3 at 50-60fps through and through at ultra settings. This doesn't BEGIN to compare to how that game looks, and I struggle to get half of the framerate I'd get on The Witcher 3. And don't fool yourself into thinking you can turn the graphics down either. When I'm at maximum graphics, everything as good as it can be, I get about 25-30FPS with lag spikes all over the place. When I turn everything down to 0, I get 28-34FPS, and the lag spikes as present as ever.I do like this game. I think the gameplay's engaging, and it's simulator-ish nature leaves the door open to great storytelling and creative ideas. But I can't reccomend it in this state, I just can't.I've played the game for 12 hours at the time of this review. I've had 11 crashes during that time. I haven't pressed the quit button once, the game always does it for me.That's just pitiful.			"

												Having skipped a few years from WWE 13 to WWE 2k16, i was blown away by 16 and loved it and found lots to do.  I was extremely anxious for WWE 2k17, expecting it to be an augment for 2k16, something like what WWF No Mercy was over WWF Wrestlemania 2000.The end result is immensely dissatisfying, though.  The graphics look exactly the same to me, though there may be some improvements.  Something about the way the flesh and colors look makes them all look flat and plastic.  The sort of dis-realism of the wrestlers and their expressions from 2k16 were not at all addressed here.  The game modes are all the same from 2k16, with backstage brawling and crowd brawling finally added in, but segregated so that you can't go backstage during the course of a tables match or hell in a cell match, but only if you pick Backstage Brawl.The roster list is the same ugly mess that came with 2k16.  Current superstars are mixed in with former superstars and superstar variants, seemingly without care.  Certain superstars who would have been highly publicized for inclusion (or were highly publicized for previous years) or made something unlockable or part of a ""Legends"" pack are just there, included in the list as if they were Aidan English or Zack Ryder, with no special labeling or being included in a separate list.The DLC for new superstars is also massively underwhelming, charging 9-10 dollars for about 7 superstars total, while not bothering to add people like the current NXT champion Bobby Roode.Ultimately what killed this game for me was the lack of attention or care to details.  Simple things that could have added a bit of zest to the experience.  WWE 2k16 had this for me in the form of the wrestler taunts; certain wrestlers' taunts had them speaking out loud.The nature of NXT now is such that it has a highly devoted, energetic fanbase, and the experience of having crowds sing along with Nakamura or Bobby Roode's entrance music can be just as awesome as a match itself.  As more NXT favorites come to the main roster (like Kevin Owens, Samoa Joe, Bayley, Charlotte Flair), their fans stick with them and bring their unique reactions and chants with them.WWE 2k17 has nothing at all like that.  The crowd is dead as any other WWE game, with the exact same monotonous crowd noise triggered at the same points of an entrance.  No one sings along to Shinsuke Nakamura's music.  There are no competing chants, no half-boos and half-cheers for the likes of John Cena or AJ Styles.  No one chants ""Joe's gonna kill you"" or ""Asuka's gonna kill you"" at the start of a Samoa Joe or Asuka match.  A superstar labelled a heel is flatly booed with generic audience boos, a face is flatly cheered with generic cheers.And the multiplayer for PC is essentially DOA.  It's exactly the same double-blind matchmaking system from WWE 2k16, where you can be waiting for hours for a matchup that will never happen while being forced to ""practice"" wrestle against the computer in an empty arena.Ultimately this game reeks of mediocrity, being just another cash-grab entry in a franchise that has to put out a new game yearly.  Sometimes the cycle gets broken with a whole new game (recently like WWE 12 over the Smackdown vs Raw series), but this latest entry is stuck in the middle, being little more than some tiny changes and added features over the previous entries.For a first-time buy, or for someone who hasn't played since Smackdown vs Raw, this would be an amazing WWE game, but if you've played WWE 2k16, this is more of the same, safe and predictable.

												Where to begin in this hot mess?Let us put it this way: 2k has to sincerely consider to change the development team since they seem to be unable to fix glitches and problems persistent since 2k15 and also reintroduce problems which were already fixed. Most of them are clipping issues and related to the entrance. For example: If you change the slightest bit of the entrance atttire of AJ Styles his hoodie is suddenly glued to his head. Do not dare to give any ingame superstar another jacket. While sometimes it seemingly works, on ohter occasions they will wear the belt over the jacket, which stretches it into oblivion. These issues are more prominent with custom made belts which brings me to the next glaring issue: The audio.As pointed out by several other people the annoying repeating sound at a show start is just a glaring oversight which indicates that this game was either rushed, had no Q&A or the Q&A failed miserably or was overlooked.There are numerous more issues like the recent Jerry Lawler fauxpas in the Hall of Fame DLC where a botched recording was actually left in the game. However more bothersome is the announcemet of custom titles within tag teams. Ever heard of ""Jimmy Smackdown Tag Team Uso and Jey Uso""? Or ""Edge Raw Tag Team Rated R Christian""? WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND DID NOT REALIZE THAT?These glitches even continue if one of the tag team partners is holding a singles custom title like the smackdown womens championship which was bothersome to create to say the least, since they decided to not include the RAW Womens championship as a template. ""Eva Marie and Smackdown Women Emma Champion"" has got to be my favourite so far. There are a lot more audio glitches but let's get going.The graphics: The first time I saw the game at GamesCom in Germany last year I was absolutely shocked. It looked worse than it's predecessor and within 5 minutes of gameplay I had multiple glitches and bugs with weird animations and clipping through an opponent. While they slightly improved on the graphics at least during entrances the glitches and bugs remained. Some of the wrestlers are on point and look great during the entrances but some others.... oh my lord. You will not recognize them since they got rid of the real life pictures. I do not know what these guys did to the developers but either they have never actually saw them, mostly women, or just straight out hate them. You think ME Andromeda has a tired face? Look at Bailey during her entrance. She looks DEAD.Gameplay: There are some minor changes in the gameplay which I actually like and put the game more towards a simulation type of game. That is not everyone's cup but that is the direction they want to go. However even here are decisions I cannot understand. For example: Try to get the cage breaker in a Hell in a Cell match. Sometimes it is plain impossible. The submission game is worse than last year with input lag that made me submit at the beginning everytime. You will get used to it but it is still absolute crap. And yes there is a second option but that seems to be even worse.Let's take a quick look at the game modes:FINALLY you can have multiple Universe modes running at the same time. More stuff to corrupt with their still bugged cloud syncingThe MyCareer mode is forgettable more so since the introduction of the Promo System. No Audio for these kills every immersion you possibly could have. And who wrote these things? A 10 year old or an actual WWE writer? Some of the answers are absolutely hilarious and do not make any sense. The system is shoddy at best and does not work correctly in Universe mode.Conclusion:Do you get your money's worth? At full prize: HELL NO! At sale prize: still NO!This is the first 2k WWE game I sincerely regret buying. My modded 2k16 was working somewhat okay and with just the additions of backstage stuff, the ring out in multiman matches, the better taunting system it would be pretty good. But they messed up so heavy AGAIN. I cannot fathom what is happening over there. I sent over 20 bug reports with videos and pictures last year and most of them are still in THIS game. Very sadly it only a 4/10 because I have hope... but it is declining fast. Oh and do not think they will fix anything about the game. They pushed out 5 TU with minor fixes and that will be it. They do not care and are probably already at 2k18. "

												Like every WWE game to date, lots of potential but nothing more. So many features that should be in the game buy aren't. I'll start by asking questions to problems that shouldn't exist:Why am I not able to choose if I want to start in NXT instead of being plunked on the main roster in MyCareer?Why can I not skip the long♥♥♥♥♥intros to stupid shows that nobody cares about?Why do I have to pay money for stuff that should be in the base game?Why the hell does this game take place BEFORE the brand split?Why do I still have to participate in 2 matches a week in MyCareer mode without exception? Why doesn't it tell me how to just walk out and cut a promo in MyCareer?Why is there a noticable amount of lag when i'm running this on a great cpu/gpu build? Why is it that I have to hit John Cena with 10 finishers in a row in MyCareer mode to beat him (not even being sarcastic)?Why didn't they spend more time perfecting weird-looking WWE superstars?I could go on and on, but I have a life.My biggest problem is WHY THE HELL IS THE SUBMISSION SYSTEM IN THIS GAME 100% BROKEN?!?!?! Don't believe me? Try for yourself. Although I'll probably still play this game since I am a huge wrestling fan, I cannot condone the fact that WWE released yet another unpolished and buggy game on PC. Terrible.			"

												I'm about 10 hours into this game and I have to say that my experience, then game has run flawlessly. I have not been having the crashes and glitches that others have, but if I know the steam community, I know I can expect a ton of downvotes for saying so. Sorry.For me, the game has run very smoothly with a constant 60 fps at 1080p. The matches load quickly. I feel like the balancing has been improving every year since 2K15. I'm really good at these games, and it was impossible for the AI to beat me in previous games. Now the AI actually feels like a challenge (well, sometimes anyways). I lost my very first steel cage match, which shocked the hell out me since I have not lost one since the ps3 era. But that only made me excited to keep playing. Before, I would create a character, win the championship almost instantly and never lose it. I would get so bored. Well, not with WWE 2K17.Character customization is improved in almost every area, except one. In this game, you have more hair and clothing options than we have seen in a very long time. Clothing can now be used with both genders, which is great if you want to make a woman who looks like she can actually win a fight. The downside to this is that you no longer have the advanced morphing options that you used to have. Now you pick a base body and then mix and match pre-made parts like arms, legs, torsos, etc. No more big boob dominatrix girls for me... Oh well.When the game is running smoothly, I do recommend it. However, there is no way for me to tell you what kind of experience YOU are going to have. If the game did not work for me I would be mad too. If you are thinking of getting this game, I suggest that you do as many matches as you can within the first 2 hours. Don't waste any time with character creation. If the game is going to crash, it is likely to happen during matches. This way, if the game does not work for you, you should still be able to refund it. Believe me when I say that you can spend all day creating new wrestlers.			"

												This is probably the worst WWE game I've played and I have played many. The Career mode has zero depth, virtually no story or the ability to tell your own, virtually no voice overs after the ""performance center"" and is a complete joke. I remember my superstar getting on raw and doing a backstage interview that consisted of 1 sentence and my superstar was clearly mouthing atleast 5 paragraphs worth of words. 2K should be ashamed to have released such a piece of garbage (put someone through a table and you'll understand).

												Went to cut a promo and the new promo engine corrupted my saved data. Lost all progress.10/10. Would spend a month on a game to suddenly lose it all to the game's latest and biggest feature again.Buy this game for someone on your friends list that you actually kind of hate.			"

												Sure, the game is all nice. Decent graphics, smooth animation, a well-shaped creation system for entrances and characters.Matches plays out fine too... But now that we're over the singleplayer content...Gosh dangit the multiplayer is horrible, randomly phasing in matches, loosing connection midgame while the internet is all fine and crashes before you can even choose characters. It is actually UNPLAYABLE with friends or other people online!That has been my major experience, bad online and a ton of crashes. Otherwise it is an okay game.I hope they fix these things, else it is not worth the bloody price.			"

												When 2k15 and 2k16 came out one thing was said about them, they are the step in the right direction and we should give 2k time to improve on these games since they have just started with them.That has brought us to 2k17 the best in the 3 of the games originally made by 2k.It is a far smoother experience with a lot of fun variations.The title was also released sooner than the other two and that is a good thing.All in all 2k17 is truly a good game and another step in the right direction for wwe games.I do recommend the game since I am having a whole lot of fun with it and its performance has been solid so far.

												INITIAL REVIEW WAS ON FEB 9 2017Wait for a patch before buying this game!Since it's PC release, I've had my save data corrupted for the 5th time! Meaning I had to - set up a universe, - recreate my CAWs (you CAN upload them so when things go sideways, they're just a download away... But still!!), - adjust the settings and game/superstar balance- deal with the random crashing...more times than I'd like. PS4 users have supposedly dealt with the save data bug when it was released, it had something to do with putting the console on sleep mode while the game is on, OR downloading things from the community.never downloaded anything after my first data corruption, and who puts their PC on sleep mode nowadays....tldr:Wait for a patch before buying this game!-------UPDATE! 2/13/17so this review has gone through some updates, but, I stand by what I initially said, and suggest waiting for a patch before buying this game. If, however, you can't wait for a patch I can perhaps offer some quick fixes to (technical) problems present in the game._________________________SAVE BUG!!!wtf is it - Deletes your progress. Universe, CAWs, Settings, Downloads, etc., *poof* gone just like that.wtf do I do:- TURNING off steam cloud sync may help. >>> Library > right click the game > Properties > Updates > uncheck the steam cloud sync box.- MANUALLY back up your saves>>> Go to steam / userdata / unique ID / 510510 (510510 is the game's steam ID)>>> Copy and save the files inside 510510 each time you exit the game, so whenever a save gets corrupted, you can easily replace them with a clean one.- UPDATE your graphics card>>> According to user Saturn (from the comments) upgrading his graphics card fixed the save issue for him.___________________________POOR PERFORMANCE EVEN ON BEAST SYSTEMS!!!wtf is it - Game runs slow no matter the graphics setting or how powerful your computer is.wtf do I do:- RUNNING the game as administrator>>> Right click the game > Properties > Local Files > Browse Local Files > Right click WWE2k17_x64.exe > Properties > Compatibility > Check 'Run program as Admin' Box > Apply > Right click .exe > Send to desktop.- CHOOSE the correct processor (I use Nvidia)>>> Launch Nvidia Control Panel > Manage 3D settings > Program Settings Tab > Select the game (If not there ADD the game) > Select correct Processor > Apply > Close_________________________RANDOM CRASHING!!!wtf is it - Game crashes randomly... lolwtf do I do:- CHANGE the game's priority>>> While in game, alt+tab out > Open Task Manager > Go to Details Tab > Right click wwe2k17 > Set priority to HIGHNOTE: Even after doing this, the game still crashes specifically when going to edit custom superstars again when you've just edited them (even after 3-4 matches).________________- In my honest opinion, it's a great game. Much more polished than 2k16, however some CHANGES, additions, and REMOVAL of certain features are... Questionable. - Also the submission minigame was changed slightly so... heads up. lol- Do I recommend the game? YES!- Should you wait for a patch? YES!- What if you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ what I think? YES! >>> Get the game, just take precautions and be aware of these issues.Cheers.			"

												And we thought THQ were bad.With every year, 2K have got lazier and lazier, and they've finally tapped out with no subtlety.- Showcase is gone, with nothing replacing it.We all thought about the great ideas they could do for the next few Showcases, and this year would've been a good one for a Women's or 4 Horsewomen Showcase, and their reaction was to just remove the main mode of the recent series entirely. I'm gobsmacked.Note that last year they did an Austin Showcase, which a lot of was just a copy/paste of a previous game's Attitude Era Showcase. This year they couldn't even be bothered to have one at all.Though they're releasing a Hall of Fame DLC in the near future, so look forward to just a handful of random matches that weren't even all that important to their career and a whopping 30 minutes of Showcase gameplay.- But Career and Universe haven't been improved, and actually are still exactly the same, broken, and boring as ♥♥♥♥What they've been doing with all this free time they have by just not bothering with Showcase I don't know, because the other two main modes are exactly the same. Career still has you slogging away beating the same jobbers 100 times and delivering awful gibberish 'promos' inbetween, Universe is similarly just random matches.To top it off, your created guy in Career can't use most moves because you have to 'buy' them with imaginary currency you have to grind. Imagine yourself with a Lionsault and a certain DDT? Then you have to slog a no doubt riveting bunch of matches against Bo Dallas on Main Event first to buy them.- Promos are the only new feature, and they're broken too. Everyone has split-personality.You can now deliver promos if you feel like. You could do this in the last game, and this time it's similar, but now it's in Universe too, but without the voice acting. So you have the same generic promo text being 'said' by anyone from Undertaker to Bayley. But the conversation choices are obscure.- WWE 2k17 presents: a promo between anti-establishment champion Dean Ambrose and corporate heel Kevin OwensI was crazy Dean delivering a promo, and Owens came down to talk some smack for our feud. Kevin had a go at Dean for being part of the Authority. (What?) So I had a go at him for being part of the Authority. (What?) I was face, but was apparently delivering a heel promo. (What?) Kevin was heel, but was apparently delivering a face promo. (What?) We traded generic insults. Dean said Kevin is too mentally unwell to challenge him and he has to see a psychiatrist and calm down before getting a match with him. (WHAT?)DEAN 'LUNATIC FRINGE' AMBROSE SAID THIS. Dean Ambrose told someone else they were too crazy so they didn't deserve a title chance!I, Dean, 'won' the promo battle for some unknown reason.Hooray?- ConclusionAnd that's it. That's all there is in the game. It's only for exhibition matches really.In short: 2K16 was exactly the same game as 2K15 but with slick animation and flow into other moves and a much-needed reversal system. 2k17 is exactly the same as 2K16 but with the entire main game mode taken out.I fear for the franchise's future. Very sad.UPDATE: There's even a bit of commentary in the HoF DLC (yet to be released on PC) where King MESSES HIS LINES and rereads them. TWICE. IN THE GAME! Evidently 2K don't give a crap about their professionalism and standards any more. They actually have my sympathy; I pity them. Good luck in their future endeavours.			"

												I have pretty good gaming computer (GTX 1070), plenty of WRAM and this game runs in slow motion when I try to do matches with more than 2 people in the ring. Even when I turn all the settings down which I never have to do for any other game. It doesn't seem to be optimized for pc.			"

												Deluxe Edition reviewed - 3rd party store that was £40.FIRST IMPRESSIONS:-Much improved iteration of the last 2 games, a lot of the models have been updated and better lighting effects, higher AA options, more creation content, replay editors, will update review once had more time to mess with it, but so far first impressions are better than 2k15 and 2k16 editions.25 hours of gameplay later---------------------------------------Well a lot more time has passed and I have messed about with creation tools, played online matches, played solo career modes and have noticed subtle difference, which is easier to explain as Pros vs Cons against the 2k16 edition.Pros:-* More character ainmations* Smoother animations between actions* New taunting system is vastly improved, taunts can be performed in and around the ring, apron, and on the ropes etc. for the crowds or taunting wrestlers directly to get up etc... and the AI use it too, making it look and feel more like the TV show.* Less input lag from controller - although some of the minigames are still so-so.* Better lighting effect, noticebly more lights and smoke FXs* 8xAA supported (4xAA cap last two versions) so better quality available.* Performance of the game is still great, getting a solid 60fps in highest settings at 4k resolution, even with 8xAA it only drops by 2fps at most in a 30man Royal Rumble. (I7 3770k with gtx1080, 32gb RAM) and a lot of the cutcenes on intros are now running in 60fps (some parts are locked to 30fps still).* Better CAW system* New (text only) Promo mode added to career mode* New batch of Superstars added to roster* Simpler UI menus - stripped away all the fluff and literally just text menu system that shows everything you need to see all at once, saves a lot of time looking for sub-menus.* New basic video editor tools for making match highlights into videos for your custom character's titantron videos, although the encode seems to be glitched is a very dark output.* Loading times are vastly better, at least on my system, which helps a lot going between creator tools.* Seems they have fixed the sound problems seen in 2k15 and 2k16 where I had lost crowd sounds in custom character matches occassionally.Cons:-* Still has the dumb as♥♥♥♥♥♥console upload/download system instead of Steam Workshop, as long as still having 100 slot cap, with 20 downloads per 24 hour period limit. (seriously???)* Creation tools occasionally crash out when re-editing your characteers, causing a CTD device video driver crash - I've tried numerous drivers and nothing has fixed it, so will need dev patch.* AI is still a bit wonky on the decision making in AI matches* Some of the necklaces and gowns, cloaks etc. still suffer from clipping issues* Commentary is still quite limited, hear a lot of things repeated* Still no custom music importing* Still no custom videos for Titanwall importing* Paid DLC this time around - bit of a annoyance given it still had a 4-5 month delay in release, sorry but paid dlc should only happen if we get the game the same week as consoles, not midway into that season when 5-6 months to new build of the game.*Still no roster updates mid-season, bit annoying if they are going to DLC things up and not have a roster update to reflect heel turns and changes to intros etc. EA / FIFA do this for free... just saying.* Took out some of the old classic stars to fit in new characters, really this should ever happen, always add, never remove... I miss Honky Tonk Man etc.* Online play while on the whole seems less laggy, the matchmaking service is a utter joke... seriously needs an overhaul, thankfully I mainly play solo and mess about with custom creations, but I'd guess this a big feature to be broken for the majority of buyers. When I have played online sessions it's strictly private matches with friends which was hassle free.* Create a wrestler mode only borked one thing, they removed the ability to create fat / thin models entirely, despite having many skinny and oversized characters in the game.... that's a massive (pun intended) oversight to people that like to build freeks of nature, instead of buff medium bodied people.Overall - I feel like this is a improved game and worth the price, hopefully once the bugs are ironed out it will become the defact wrestling game on PC (not thats it shard to be with no competition from EA UFC series).

												Ok, first off, this game is pretty good... but the amount of issues that this game has is unbelievable. I have an i5-6600k with a GTX 970 and I barely get 60 fps at times (v-sync is off). If it's not the framerate issues then it's the crashing. Out of the ~12 hours I've played this game has crashed at least 7 times on me. Kind of frustrating that it crashes in the middle of a 5-star match right?Stick with 2K16 until/if they fix the issues.EDIT: I keep giving this game a chance, re-installed to see if they fixed it, no fix yet. It's kind of sad because the features they added are pretty cool but it's really poorly optimized.			"

												Take more time to make these games, you noobs!  In a nutshell this game is a disappointing mess and I feel like I got robbed by paying for it in full along with a season pass.  Bugs GALORE in every nook and cranny of this title, clunky collision and controls, overpriced DLC, no attention to detail, removed features and assets from previous games, the list goes on for days...  Rent it on a console if you want to give it a try, but don't pay for it without playing it first.  It's not even worth the sale price in my book.  The most disappointing part is the fact that there is a good wrestling engine here, but the game still manages to suck terribly.			"

												A 21:9 Review!First off, I bought this game on PS4when it was first released, I loved it then and even more so now with better graphics and a smoother gameplay experience! Although missing 2K showcase mode, it still offers enough in the way of Roster, Creation and gameplay.So...21:9 aspect ratio.....This game supports it! (kind of). The in ring action 21:9, the replay overlays 16:9 which make for weird viewing. The menu screen 16:9. Create a superstar, I don't even know what aspect ratio it'sa using...the smoke is 21:9 but the background is not. My point here is if you're going to support it then be consistent with the entirety of the product.Another thing that is currently plagued is Create an Arena...I had this issue on console at release. The game freezes everytime I try and use this feature so I have been avoiding it until there's a fix.With all that being said I know Yuke's always do their best with patching this franchise so I know it's just something I have to live with at the moment.

												Do NOT buy this game if you are huge into creating characters /caws. Purchase 2k16 instead. For me this game is a huge stepdown.I'm in shock. I didn't know the sliders were gone and replaced by a few extremely limiting presets. I pretty much spent my only hour in the game so far, all in character creator, wanting to pull my hair out and yelling at some imaginary designer for doing away with the sliders. There is zero way i can replicate my favorite wrestlers i made last year. Or even make new ones that look good. I tried already. They all look like juiced up idiots. This is terrible and for me, the worst step back of the series yet.  I dont understand why you would make this decision. And don't understand why none of the reviews i read mentioned this. This is a HUGE deal for anyone into making their own caws. I made a 40 wrestlers promotion in 2k16. All my own creations. There is no interest now for me to do this in 2k17. Because sure the attire choices are more complex and all that, but what do i care when i cant precisely design he body type? How do you even make cruiserweights look like cruiserweights?  You can't from what i've seen.I can't think of a time when i'll get over this. This game is dead to me an hour in. I'm going back to 2k16. Stupid me, i pre ordered this through gamersgate cause they had an extra 10% off (25% off instead of 15% on steam). Worst decision. I can't get a refund. Thanks for nothing 2k games.			"

												Great game if you're a fan of wrestling. I wouldn't reccomend this game if you only want to play online, because although you can still find matches every now and then, very few people play online and most of the time it is difficult finding a match.For local multiplayer though this is hands down one of the best games, especially if you're a wrestling fan. I highly recommend this game for the local multiplayer.			"

												this would be a whole lot better if it wasnt so buggy.  if you have something in your hands 9 out of 10 times you wont be able to drop it unless you get hit or use it 4 times so make sure you need it.  occationally if you tap the LB to interact with an object it might stop your character from moving all together till you get attacked.  for me about 40-60% of the time if i have an object in hand you might not be able to enter or leave the ring.....  if you have been playing do not go to creation area it might glitch and stop the game from working!  after 4 seperate times of this happening i know its not an accidental once in a lifetime hiccup.  if you absolutely love wrestling id say you might be able to ignore all the bugs.  but its very annoying!  i recommend this game for most of it and if the bugs get fixed i recommend it for anyone.

												If you are looking for a new, fun wrestling game and you want to buy WWE 2K17, think again. WWE 2K17 is definitely not worth your time nor money.I was very dissapointed with this game. When 2K17 had came out on Steam, I was very excitied because it had some new additions and it seemed it was going to be the best WWE 2K Game to date. But, when I brought 2K17 and I played it, it got very stale within an hour. The matchups are sort of limited and the gameplay is so slow and boring. I miss it when the older games had that arcade-style type of gameplay that made it enjoyable and fun. 2K17 unfortunately does not have that. Not only that, but it makes NO sense to make PC gamers pay for all the DLC's. What kind of deal is that? So, we have to wait about 3-4 months for 2K17 to come out yet by the time it comes out, we have to pay $80.00 just for some DLC's? Wouldn't it have been more smart to just have all the DLC's come out with the game just like 2K16? I don't understand why 2K Sports would do this.                                                                                                                                                             While 2K17 did have some fun in it such as the creations and modes, overall, you'll get very bored of it quickly. The fun just isn't there and it's kind of lacklusture considering all the hype that came with this game. We have to pay for all of the DLC's yet you give us Goldberg for free? Horrible deal. MyCareer Mode is interesting and does seem to have some depth in it, but to be honest, you'll get very bored of it in nearly 2 days and it'll get repetitive very fast. While 2K17 may have some opitions that are exiciting and will keep you busy, overall, if you have 2K16 on Steam, I would just keep playing it and save your money until 2K18. I just hope 2K Sports will put much more effort into 2K18, but until then, I'm saving up until 2K18.			"

												Complete and utter pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥  The online mode is a laughable abomination, you have to wait 10-20 minutes plus to even get a simple 1-1 match, forget about trying for elimination chamber or anything that requires multiple people online as there simply seems to be barely anyone playing this turd online.  And when you do eventually get a match its plagued by random slowdowns, and people that are magically able to kick out of everything you do despite their health meter saying they shouldn't be able to move let alone kick out.  I have played full online matches in some kind of weird slow motion mode where the game is running at 60fps but it feels like half that, and i have recordings of this occuring.  Odds are if you eventualy get a game online, win or lose when you hit next match and go through the waiting game you'll be playing against the same person again.   Online is pretty much dead and knowing 2K it'll be disabled totally before June.Still no option to import mp3 files from your PC to use as Entrance Music, forget about the fact that RAW 2 on the original xbox done this in 2003, apparently thats too much of a feature for the Monkeys at 2K/Yukes to shoehorn into the Game. Then again its hardly surprising considering that the 2016 version of this game had random crashes with the Enzo\Cass entrance that to this day they have never fixed, they just release these games, patch them once or twice if you're lucky and abandon it.  Not worth the purchase price, not even worth a quarter of the purchase price. Theyre wanting triple A money for a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port that has practically zero pc exclusive features. In short, ♥♥♥♥ off 2k and take this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥with you.			"

												First review I'm ever writing; because this is a terrible, terrible game! Not only are the controllers unresponsive - and damn near random at times - but what'll ultimately defeat you, are the God aweful game mechanics. Really, you have to have a quarter of a second reflexes to counter attacks. In addition, the controller is so unintuitive you'll have a damn hard time picking up a ladder; carrying it over to the ring; getting it onto the ring; picking it up again; placing it; and then trying to climb it. It's so far from anything you've ever played, that you'll have to search online for how to do this SIMPLE task. Maybe I'm just terrible at the game, but I can't even get past the first two guys in career mode. And it's soooo slow paced! It's just plain terrible. Terrible!It can be a pretty great experience if you could play with a few other mates; and we've tried. We've tried hosting our own servers, we've tried randomly queueing up for Live servers. Every single time, it seems one of us times out, and we're no longer participating in the same battles. This may be due to server issues - which may be fixed later - but it's just such a terrible experience; having to restart every single match, because we're pretty much playing against each others AI ghost. Terrible!The most fun I've had so far, is the character creation. And even that is pretty darn limited. Having to choose from premade body types rather than having to create your own with sliders, is a terrible change. This is pretty weird, as most of the aspects with the character creation menu promotes silly outfits and such. What the hell were they thinking?! Terrible!I really can't recommend this game in its current state. Heck, I can't even recommend a game like this to anyone! It's just so badly made. I mean, I'm not expecting Tekken or anything, but the only fun you'll get out of this type of game, is making silly characters in the character creation, and showing them off. Terrible!			"

Feel like wasting $60 on some poorly optimised garbage that's aimed to cashgrab wrestling fans on consoles an then poorly ported to pc? like most 2k games now a days this one sucks too wow could you guess it? i for sure couldn't. but really don't buy it you will spend 2 hours creating your career char and then when you get to the actuall game it's to late to refund.

												A total disappointment, I've played a Hell in a cell match and it's been extremly frustrating, the walls of the cell are now harder to break, you cannot place the opponent anymore on the commentators table and on the ceiling of the cage, when you break it, the opponent doesn't fall through it anymore.Instead of adding new stuff you can do in WWE2k17 they remove it, very disappointed			"

												Got this game as gift from a top cobber of a friend so we could Rustle and stuff but we encountered some pretty severe desync in the multiplayer which ended up with me in the crowd on his PC and I was beating the crap outta him on my PC with a ladder.If you do buy this game do it for the couch co-op or the single player stuff multi is probably not gonna get fixed for the forseeable future as this issue was also prevelent in 2K16.

												I play this game for Singleplayer mostly, and for single play it's a damn nice game!!! Okay there are sometimes crashes, but 2K support is mighty fine in that. Not sure if there has been a patch but well.I might start multiplayer once or twice to get the achievement, but otherwise meh.All in all, Awesome game!			"

												Definitely a good addition to the series, but unfortunately has paid DLC.Pros:Good graphics: Looks very realistic, graphics have definitely improved, the game feels pretty authentic and it has a lot of real life videos as well, which add to the wrestling fan experience. Also each show has the genuine intro for it, which is nice.Stacked roster: 136 playable characters included without DLC, 156 including DLC. This is pretty damn stacked and is an all time high for WWE games, very happy with the size of the roster, although the base game is missing a few names and annoyingly is locked under DLC.Great range of game modes: WWE games always have a huge amount of game modes and options, this one is no different. Every match you can think of, can be made in this game.MyCareer: Improvement over last year, definitely the best mode in the game and it has now added promos, shirt sales and a Paul Heyman storyline, which is very interesting. Also the presentation looks a lot better than last year, with all the show cut scenes/music etcCreation: A lot of customisation which is great, spent hours creating my character for MyCareer, huge amount of different moves (including Phenomenal Blitz), a lot of new entrances and the general classic create a character, superstar threads etcPerformance: Runs great on an i7 7700k and a 1070, constant framerates, big improvement over last year. Last year had a ton of fps drops and the 30fps cut scenes were often 25fpsCons:Paid DLC: It'd be less annoying if the DLC was for characters that are new or not relevant, but for the time this game came out, my favourite tag team aren't even in the base game, I have to pay for Gallows and Anderson!? And obviously it's missing a few names like Mojo Rawley, Nia Jax, Shinsuke Nakamura, Apollo Crews and Tye Dillinger. And sorry 2K, I'm not paying $10 just so I can get Gallows and Anderson... Two people who should be in the base gameOutdated: I obviously expected this upon purchase, but this game is seriously out of date. This game was made pre-brand split, which is the biggest change in the WWE since the birth of the PG era. So everyone is on the wrong brands, there's key names (like Gallows and Anderson) missing from the base game and it just feels incredibly outdated.30fps cut scenes: Shows a lack of effort for PC, a PC game should not have 30fps cut scenes.Late release: 2K really need to start treating PC gamers with more respect, this is my third WWE game i've bought on PC and it's still being released in February?Overall:The game is a good addition to the series, but don't expect the latest and greatest from the WWE, because it is far too out of date and too many characters are locked behind a paywall. The series is improving though, and we should support WWE on PC, it's been a long time			"

												I wish there was a ""depends"" option for Steam Reviews.Before I go into this review at all, I have a EVGA GTX 1060 ACX, An Intel i5-4690K, and 16GB of ram, and I can run this game flawlessly at Ultra. (Yet that doesn't prevent me from crashing from time to time)For those who don't typically care for a longer review, here's your short version:THE GAME WORKS, BUT YOU MAY NEED A MORE POWERFUL MACHINE THAN POSTED AND THE GAME DOES CRASH FROM TIME TO TIME.There. Now onto the actual review.I've never been one to buy these games for the online play, so I don't really know much about the 2K Live feature in the game. Sorry. Ever since SVR 2011 onwards, I've been building my own shows, rosters, arenas, titles, etc. for Universe Mode. Sure, it takes a while, but I find it more fun than to play with more of the actual roster. 2K16 had a really bad repetition feeling issue to it where (As everyone knows) Triple Threats, Fatal Four-ways, and Tag Matches were nightmares. This year a rollout feature was implemented to alleviate that problem so they're at the very least playable now. In addition to that, All matches (IMO) got three times more interesting with moving the match rating system to the rest of the game instead of just keeping inside MyCareer. The Character customization in this game is BEAUTIFUL. There's an overwhelming amount of clothing possibilities, there's body sliders, theres body customization, Everything.There's a bit more depth to show and arena customization from 2K16, as well as creating a victory. No longer do custom characters share the same animations when they win fights. On top of that, There's been more additional generic themes and animations for entrances and whatnot so when Sound Injector comes out for this game there will be so many more music slots available for us to overwrite. Overall, it is what it is: A Better 2K16. Do I think you should buy it right now? Depends. You buying it for offline or online? I'd say buy it on a sale, or get a key from♥♥♥♥♥or something. I don't think its worth the full price (Even though I paid in full for it) but if you like WWE, and have a decent rig. Go for it. Hell you even get Goldberg for free.			"

												Best 2k WWE game to date. The Universe mode is great along with all the customizability. Community Creations allow for new superstars to be added (however, we need to wait for the less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ versions). One of the bad parts of this game however, is the bugs. and the lack of a showcase mode at launch (however there is a DLC soon with the hall of fame showcase mode).			"

												Terrible controls. If I wanted to anticipate a move that long before it happens, I would play chess. When your opponent grapples you, you have a 0.0000001 second chance to hit reverse, then you will wait for Dragon Ball Z amounts of time before they actually START the move. There is no chance for actual reaction in this game, only hitting reverse a minute before anything begins to happen. I dont want a mini game to get out of a submission hold. If I wanted that, I would play Mario Party. I also dont want a timing/guessing game for holds, I just want a block button that you can hit at the right time when a move is actually starting. Yes, I am a caveman that wants my wrestling game to be button smashing, BECAUSE IT IS WRESTLING. There are other games for timing and strategy, I am waiting for the day when someone can get it right and make a beer drinking, button mashing, easy controls wrestling game. Fanboys may hate this review and turn their nose up, but it still has Michael Hayes, so how ""refined"" should a wrestling game be?			"

The game crashes when you try to look for opponents online. The game crashes most of the time when you try to launch My Career mode. The game crashes when you are in the middle of a match. it has potential but 2k is apparently trolling their customers. It's gotten very annoying. I hope they fix this.... Damnit. Till they clean up this unholy mess of theirs, i'd suggest you spent that cash on a much more optimized game. Lost faith in 2k.			"

												Though I have enjoyed the WWE game franchise on a yearly basis since 2010, with 2K17 in it's current state I can't recomend it. The game itself, when working smoothly, in my opinion is fantastic, in no way is the actual mechanics and gameplay in this game bad. If you want a good wrestling simulation, for that task, it's great. However, as I stated before; ""when working smoothly"". This game for myself has crashed multiple times, usually between mid menus during show and wrestler customization, however it has happened mid match a few times to which is infuriating. The game has a lot of glitches that need fixing (one that is brought up a lot is the repeating sound of the titantron intro during mycareer and universe mode).Also, if you intend on buying this game to play with your friends online, that is something I definitely do not recomend. I've tried multiple times to use the ""Private Match"" option with friends to play matches and every time the game has ""phased"" (Essentially what I mean is that both players get split apart from the conection and essentially face an AI incapable of fighting back rather than the person you were facing).As I said at the start, I love the franchise and the game, when it's working is very fun. But with all the problems it has currently and the price their asking for, for essentially a game that has already been out half a year, I cannot recomend you purchase it currently until these major problems get fixed.

												It took me 20 mins to write this review. read it sincerely.Cons:1. create a superstar> start my career>play for a while> get bored with it2. play universe mode> make your deepest dreams come true!!!> turn cena heel and bury Roman Reigns> play with little storylines> (eventually) get bored with it3 .NO Showcase Mode for any current-generation superstar (forget HOF DLC)4. Entrance mo-caps (f ' ing Bulls***) [consider AJ Styles, Bayley, Xavier Woods the most, heck, the whole roster] [No one has any expressions for god's sake, Sasha's entrance is of a elementary school kid. Bayley's mouth is glued, AJ has girly hands, his hand gesture is totally WRONG and his entrance becomes inconsistent after attire changes are made] 5. Wrestlemania ramps are still like those of NXT: TakeOver(s)6. WrestleMania crowd has barely 25K people in it (count it by yourself) as there is too much space left unused. A Shame that it's a current-generation game.7. Wrestlemania stadium lightings. Every arenas have the same amount of light for the stands meaning RAW lighting setup = WrestleMania lighting setup (seriously, lol), lmao8. Even in normal arenas i.e. Raw or SummerSlam, the lights barely reach the upper decks.9. There are no chairs for people in the uppermost decks at WrestleMania stadium. (that's rude, lol)10. U can't select evening time for Wrestlemania 32.11. Still can't import Custom Music for CAS.12. Superstar models of Dana Brooke, Alexa Bliss, AJ Styles (hair doesn't move), Dolph Ziggler (to an extent only) < Roman Reigns model.13. Very few animations to choose from in Create-A-Victory (still enjoyable nonetheless)14. Removal of Superstar tattoos to choose from in CAS (hurt me as I had Corbin's chest tattoo in 2k16, but fine now)15. Booby Roode could well have been a part of the Future Stars Pack instead of The Club (they should've already been on the standard version of the game)16. Hair physics are still bad for like more than 10 years or so....17. Optimization for PC18. Have to spend half of  your life in Career mode to earn VC (for abilties, skills, etc).19. No free-roam camera for Higlight Reel. (still fine enough)20. Gameplay: Too much dragging out of the ring  by the Superstars (AI) in MITB matches. (that's annoying)21. Sometimes, people chant ''Let's go Cena'' intead of ''Let's go Cena, - Cena Sucks'' (which is dumb and unrealistic)22. I can still see John Cena (where did the realism go???). 1/10Pros:1. AJ Styles ''the BEST thing to enjoy about the game''2. Promo Engine (still enjoyable and might improve a lot in the future).3. A lot more things added to use in Create-An-Arena (new Headers, titantrons, etc.) and the addition of choosing daytime/evening/night in open-air arenas (WM31 looks fabulous).4. Addition of Create-A-Victory and Create a Video (needs improvement).5. Universe mode (except the absence of significant amount of storylines and repititive matches).6. The improvement of Create-A-Show (excellent)7. Backstage Brawls, Crowd fighting and overall Gameplay experience (includes taunt system)8. Graphics (only if you forget Wrestlemania lighting at night, every WM ramp, Alexa Bliss & Dana Brooke) 9. All-new HCTP-like Main Menu (wasn't necessary)10. Gameplay: Multi-man matches11. MY FAVOURITE IMPROVEMENT: The ability to chose Bray Wyatt, Sheamus, Baron Corbin lighting and more than one entrance themes in Create-An-Entrance. I give this 99/10 as i've wanted something like this for so many freaking years. LOVE IT.Additional Pros:1. Give Cesaro, Sami Zayn, Zack Ryder, Dolph Ziggler, etc a monster push in Universe Mode (forget strowman)2. Bury Roman Reigns all u want.3. Sometimes...Cena will be there and u won't be able to see him. 10/10Conclusion: This how WWE 2k15 should've been but still a good game.			"

Also six man tag team ain't available fo' females either, a lil bummer!Otherwise, if the game runs, 'tis good, better than 2k16 as I found. Good changes.Sumone said the sliders for customization were gone but not true, they're still there.So uh.. I do recommend it when the crashes 'n corrupt saves get patched!			"

												I HAVE to leave a Negative Review.  Im sorry, I didnt WANT to do it.  I WANTED to love this game.  But this is just..  tedious at best, and god ♥♥♥♥ing awful at worst.Nevermind the annoying♥♥♥♥♥bugs and random frame drops.  At least those can be fixed... at least those can be addressed!What CANT be fixed, what CANT be addressed.. is the HORRIBLY bad graphics/facial captures... my GOD some of these characters look like nightmare pod people drawn by a 5 year old with parkinsons and turrets.  Go find a screenshot of Natalya's face, tell me it doesnt horrify your soul.  What also cant be fixed is the AWFUL commentary voices.  I do mean AWFUL.  I cant.. I just cant begin to describe how lazy, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sloppy and pathetic they are.  JBL sounds consistantly like he's talking to you live, directly from his left nostril.. with a cucumber sandwich jammed up his right nostril, while he simultaneously has the WORST headcold in human history.  King has like... 4 or 5 sentences he just repeats on a loop.. over.. and over.. and over.. (that's a pun for those who've played the game.. its painful.)  Cole takes the cake though.. he goes from 1 sentence repeated, to 1 sentence uttered from across an empty parking lot on a windy day, to regular voice, to REALLY LOUD VOICE.  In the same match, within 3 sentences.  I distinctly remember being able to name your finishing move, as well as having the announcers use your ACTUAL name and nickname for matches in previous years!  WHY would you take that out!?  Now its like PS2 all over again with ""Oh.. ""the Finisher"" (said with all the conviction of a porn actor) and repeatedly referring to you ""a bright  young superstar"" over.. and over.. again.That's it for voices too btw.. your promos (dont even get me started on how pointless and overly complicated they are.) interviews, head to heads etc etc.. all complete silence.  Its a bit unerving, and really irritating.  Now lets move on to what EVERYONE wants to play.. Career Mode!  Even this is just ♥♥♥♥ing BAD.  Do you like Zak Ryder?  ♥♥♥♥ you.. you're going to face him over.. and over.. and over.. and over again.  (Ive currently faced him NINE STRAIGHT WEEKS.)  Similar stories of facing 1 guy on the roster repeatedly are everywhere.  But what takes the cake of career mode is how AMAZINGLY bloated it is.  Really.  I cant believe Im saying it either.  Lemme walk you through this.1 - See Main Menu.  See your opponent, Zak Ryder.  Ugh. Click (load)2 - Watch the NXT show Opening video3 - listen to micheal cole nasal fart an opening to the crowd (load)4 - Opens Match Lineup screen, simulate bs matches get to your match.  Click (load)5 - Watch/skip Intros6 - Do Match.7 - End Match Screen8 - Finish Show Lineup.  9 - Go to Main Event Show10 - Zak Ryder.. again.. yay..11 - Watch Main Event Opening Video12 - Watch/skip Intros13 - Do Match.14 - End Match Screen15 - Finish Show Lineup.  REPEAT.You spend more time on Load screens and watching tv show opening than you do ACTUALLY wrestling opponents.. and this is EVERY.  SINGLE.  WEEK.  Cant skip em, cant turn em off.. suffer thru em.The ""music"" is exactly what I'd expect when you go find a rapper to do your soundtrack.. a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing rap music.  Which is great.. if you like rap.  If you dont.. oh well. ♥♥♥♥ you.  You cant turn it off, You cant skip it.  Suffer through it.There is so much wrong in this game.. I could go for days..  but I wont.  Just dont buy it.   "

												Not a bad game, one of the better of recent years for the WWE series.Theres a lot more customization which is always a high point in the WWE games as it's something you will; find yourself spending hours on as always.The replayability is definitely there if you have the time to waste days in the My Career mode as it is exactly what it say's on the tin, challenge the authority or become a heyman guy. You can change your movesets at any point, earn more moves by winnning matches/rivalries/promos/T shirt sales. It reall is about molding yourself into a great superstar.  Challenging anyone to a rivalry is awesome , earning championships and defending them actually gets you excited because of the hard work you put in to earn them, especially  while on a higher difficulty.I like the reverse system its easy to use and is all about timing which is similar to the previous games, although sometimes it can bug out and not show up, it will most likely get fixed in patches, if they care about the pc version.(This is my first WWE pc game so I am unsure if the developers care more about consoles or pc)My main problems are the referee and the camera, sometimes it's impossible to see where you are or when to prompt a reversal because you have him in the way or the cameras stuck in a certtain angle. Also the referee sometimes decides to take a lap or two around the players before starting a pin count, which can be pretty aggrivating when it matters.Rivalrys can be fun, sometimes weird, recently decided to call out Brock Lesnar, he became my rival which is great, problem being I have fought him twice in about 2 months of events, suprisingly I have fought john cena in literally every match apart from two PPV's in the last 4 months during this rivalry with Brock, trust me there's only so many times you want to fight Cena, takes a lot of work to bring him down even when you dominate him he will get out of a pin after your 5th finisher .Overall the game looks beautiful and has its ups and downs as with each WWE game. It has a lot of potential with or without a few patches I will put in countless hours playing. 8/10 for its Genre 7/10 in GeneralPrice tag to be honest i'd wait for the sale unless you are an avid fan.

												As much as you might be a WWE Fan I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Not buying this due to all the issues and this game was clearly rush out to meet a dead line and everyone who has purchased it is out a lot of cash and steam will never give a refund regardless.Right now there is about 50/50 chance for crash to desktop at any start of a match if the game start at all for you.The loud intro of smackdown that drowns out any commentator that goes on repeat is still there.. and unskippable.

												I haven't picked up a wrestling game since the old THQ ones on the GameCube. However, I watched Funhaus play this and I picked it up.I don't think the game is bad, but I don't think it's good. It tends to crash quite a bit, which is bad considering it's been months since this was released on console. I don't regret buying this game, but I probably should have waited to pick this up when it dropped to $30 or so. Unless you're a die hard wrestling fan I wouldn't pick this up for the price and I would say get it on console. It's defintely a far cry from the wrestling games I played as a child. Also, can you not leave the Hell in a Cell? Why do I need a special to put someone through an announcers table? The MyCareer is pretty weird, too. I have put in 30 hours strictly in MyCareer and I have only had the NXT title. I am constantly facing Samoa Joe for the title in PPV's and I hardly climb the contender rankings (I'm at #5 for the Intercontinental). I like that I don't instantly get title shots, but the way the rankings seem to work is poorly thought out. My popularity is high, I win rivalries, and cut good promos. I just don't get it.Anyways, I give it a 5, or 6 on a good day, out of 10.			"

												WWE 2k17 fixes a lot of my gripes about previous editions. They stepped it up on graphics and people look way more realistic this year than ever. Face scanning is actually done correctly in this game allowing the community to do amazing things. They took the restrictive editing of imported superstars from last year in MyCareer as you can change everything about downloaded content. The matches are more exciting and not a drag. I recall last year having to completely destroy your opponent no matter who it is to win. This year it actually matters who you face. I've had matches with Sin Cara that last about 5 mins and matches against Seth Rollins that take 10-15 mins where we actually pushed each other to the limit. The MyCareer isn't as grindy as previous years which I like a lot more. VC is more easily obtained and you aren't grinding for 100 hours to get your character to a decent level.Tutorials in this game are a hit or miss, there are some things that are well explained and others that aren't explained at all. Leaving to a lot of confusion sometimes. Nothing that will ruin the experience for you but it can be slightly annoying. The game currently crashes sometimes during loading transitions which is a big part of the game. I assume it will be fixed but it has been an issue for almost 2 days now. I also wish they allowed you to skip the intro to the show every week. Not only is it super repetitive but it is also glitched to where the logo on the titantron constantly loops, creating an annoying sound. The Characters voiceover is questionable. I don't know if it's glitched or if they are supposed to not have dialouge in promo's and such. They did last year so it only makes sense that they would right?Overall WWE 2k17 is a great experience that will leave you wanting to play and is definitely a step forward for the franchise. It's a little buggy and they could have made better choices here and there but it's worth a look at.Score: 7.5/10			"

												Oh 2K how you have changed the game from how THQ made it awsome! The short review is that this game is the same as it was last year just with some missing features from last year! While adding less than they took away! It is still fun I play this on PS4 and on PC because I love wrestling. THe PC version is no diffrent than Console especially since they do not bundle the game with DLC as previous years! I have had the game since Feb and have only experienced two or three crashes. This game is not a Crash Simulator as some have made it out to be. If you loved the other games since 2K has taken over or if you can tolerate them. Expect nothing more or less except an updated Roster and you will be fine. My only complaint that most people can't find out without others input is The online community is DEAD!!!! I have only found 4 matches the whole time I have played. So if you are an Achievment completionist stay away from this game.I do like this game and it is Fun if your a wrestling fan welcome to the only competant wrestling game on PCReviewed onGTX 1080 Ben Q 2K 32 inch Monitor 16 Gigs of Ram1TB SSDI-7 7700K Intel procRuns near perfect!

												-Needs to be Patched and Optimized--Pros-  -Matches are pretty fun, though not as good as WWF Smackdown: Shut Your Mouth.  -Huge selection of wrestlers.  -Terrific creation-a-wrestler mode supported by a community of awesome creators.  -Good selection of arenas in which to do battle.  -CONS-  -As of this writing, the game NEEDS to be OPTIMIZED. I can run games like The Witcher 3 at max settings but WWE 2K17 lags, especially during entrances.  -There's no way to turn screen filters off for older arenas. Why this option isn't in the game is beyond me. Personally, I wish 2K would do away with these entirely.  -I use an XBox One controller. Sometimes the controller will simply stop working for no reason.  -Glitches. So many glitches, though sometimes these are comical, there are other times is simply ruines a match.  -THE BOTTOM LINE-I'm a huge fan of the WWE video games and I'm delighted that 2K is not putting them on the PC. However, these games are in much need of optimization rather than just a port. Those of us who are die hard fans of these games deserve better. So, if you're a die hard fan of the WWE game and can look past some of the issues, it's still a fun game but 2K needs to release further patches in order to fix a lot of the issues that plague this game. For this reason, I cannot recommend a purchase at this time.			"

												Pc stats - I7 - GTX1080 FTW 8gRAM and 24gb RAMCrashes, Crashes, Crashes. Play a bit, Crashes.I bought 2k15, 2k16 and now 2k17 to support wrestling gaming. In its current state, I cannot  recommend this game as this is yet another lazy job from 2k.When it works, its really fun. Massive roster, good gameplay. It's all round a good game and fun to play especially if you're a wreslting fan.With that said, My Career improved over last year and is more fun.With that said - everytime you try to change your wrestlers appearance - you have a 75% chance of the game crashing on you.They removed audio from interviews and new promo features do not have audio either.New addition backstage brawl is good and even though its not there yet...It's showing promise that in 10 years time, it will feel like a great experience.Commentry is still horrible which doesn't make sense because NBA2k have the best commentry on the market accross all sports games. Most of the lines if not all are a copy paste from last year.Bugs , glitches have made a return. Though not game breaking - they do plague your experience.Pros: Nice graphics though not next gen.        Fun gameplay        Realistic        Best wrestling simulatorCons: Bugs,          TONS of crashes you don't even get in early access games.          Horrible commentry.

												This game is ok , not enough of a improvement over WWE 2K16 to pay the 75 dollars they are asking. 2K needs to get there stuff together and realize that they did not acquire the game early enough in the series where players are going to be satisfied with a simple roster update. This is the generation of game players where creation and how far you can take it is a money maker. So if 2K/WWE wants to continue making money then ther better get there stuff together and take this game to the point of WWE 12 if memory serves me correctly. Where you could create your own finisher move by move and Create a Superstar was not so limited. CAS slots are still @ 100 since 2K took it over and i remember that THQ had the number up to 150 , i am expecting major improvements in Creation Suite all around and a major increase in CAS slots (nothing below 250) before i buy another game. 2K said that they was going to make this game better , lier lier pants on fire. 2k if you do make the comment that it is due to limited space on a game console or computer (computer being the obvious on unlimited space) come on you can get Xbox One and PS4 systems with up to 1 TB (which leaves at least 250 GB for WWE games if needed). So how about you little boys over at 2K put on your big boy pants and put some serious effort in making this series worth it again. If you need someone to help you get your pants on ask big daddy WWE.			"

												This game runs perfectly for me.  Zero issues.  looks good too. I am not a WWE fan.  i am a fan of video games.  i went into this thinking the over-the-top antics would translate into a very fun video game.  who wouldn't love to fly through the air landing on people like a super hero?  i am a big fan of 2K sports games, the NBA games in particular.  i am also a big fan of MMA games.  so i figured this would be a good video game for me.the gameplay is boring.  i'm judging that purely on a video game standpoint.  more than anything else i sit around watching the game play itself waiting to hit R2.  you literally can't stand up and move around until you 'reverse"" a move the other guy is doing.  until then you watch the guy strut around pretending he's the best ever.  and if you miss the timing on hitting R2 to reverse the move you just continue to watch while the guy takes 5 seconds to twist your legs up into a pretzel.  i've never been into watching games play themselves.once you manage to reverse a move it's your turn.  you stand next to the guy and press a button.  then you watch to see if he counters, or if the move happens.  that's it.  you press a button and watch for 5 seconds.  then you press a button again.  wait for 5 seconds.  oh no!  this time he reversed you.  now you can't press whatever button you want you'll have to press R2 at a specific moment.  it's simply not fun gameplay.another issue i have is playing dress up with the characters.  i play career mode in all my sports games.  in this career mode you are forced to constantly change your tshirt and your moves.  this takes too much time as the menus are large and take a long time to load.  this is something i always tried to avoid in the MMA games.  this game glorifies that.  it makes sense because it's the WWE.  it doesn't translate to a fun video game however.  i want to play the game, not sift through menus.then we get to the ""pagentry"" of the WWE.  this game tries to show all of it.  are you familiar with the press conferences in NBA 2K?  know how you wish you could just skip that and get to the next game?  in WWE you must go out of your way to speak to the crowd, or your character's stats will suffer.  every guy has an entrance.  all the stuff you normally press start to skip in NBA just takes four times as long here.  i want to play the game, not look at how pretty the lights are when some guy comes walking towards the ring.the fights are varied, which is definitely a positive compared to MMA games.  there are 4 way brawls, 3 on 3, 2 on 2, and others.  this definitely helps during the course of a long career.  the game isn't horrible by any means.  as stated it runs perfectly on my comp.  the controls are tight, for what they are.  graphics are great but nowadays i can't ever complain about that.  however once you've dealt with all the menus, light shows, talking trash at other wrestlers and actually get into a match it just isn't fun to play.

												I'm a 90s Monday Night War fan, I hate modern wrestling and this review will reflect that.I buy these games to relive the WCW era. WWE 2k17 is the first game since WWE 2k14 (Xbox 360) that I've satisfied with the roster that has come out... The Goldberg extras along with the WCW Monday Nitro arena were big factors in persuading me to purchase this game. I'll give the pros and cons of the game below.. but I'm gonna explain why I'm giving this game a thumbs down here... Simply put the game literally shuts off my computer in Career mode making it unplayable and I noticed it once else while playing as Psycho Sid vs Sting. The game needs these bugs fixed before I can endorse it, as others can/will/could have the same issues I'm experiencing...until then the game will be rated negatively.Pros - WCW Arena, Characters: Goldberg, DDP, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Booker T, Sid Vicious (Psycho Sid), Sting, Lex Luger etc etc.. This gives me a nice roster to enjoy the days of old!Entrances seems much better than previous games, as well as crowd reactions.Acceptable roster size and variation (not great but acceptable).Cons - No Scott Steiner (which should be an automatic with a game focused on WCW and Goldberg). No Batista despite him being in 2k15 (not sure if he was in 2k16 as I didn't buy it). No Hulk Hogan.Game crashes and or shuts down my computerRoster could use less vanilla midgets / modern wrestlers and more Icons of the past.... "

												I never write reviews for any game, however for this one I had to write a review. Please avoid this game if you are buying it to play the career mode. The save file corruption issue still exist and it horrible. I lost my 33 hours of gameplay including the virutal money. 2K does a pathetic job to fix the issue. Until the bug is fixed this game is not worth buying if you are into career mode.			"

												This game is obviously better than 2K16 with more gamemodes and features however the roster and amount of arenas are very disappointing. We need more legends in these games to keep hardcore fans interested, removing people from the roster for no reason is not a good idea. Yukes should continue to expand the roster every year until we have the 'perfect' wrestling game but until then, I guess I recomend this game.			"

												If you are looking to rage 75% of the time, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU =DTo be honest, this game is a copy-paste of 2k16 and 2k15 with an all new promo engine which is still as♥♥♥♥♥♥as 2k16's. Not only is it hard to tell what you are actually saying. Button: [""I am doing this for the Universe""] Said: ""I'm doing this for the Universe, the real one not the WWE Universe."" Why the ♥♥♥♥ would I ever want to say that?! If I wanted to say that the button should have been [""I'm doing this for the real Univers not the WWE Universe""]. They lack voice overs, which didn't bother me. When you are saying a heel is a coward, it makes you more of a heel?! Even if I somehow manage to finish to promo of with a little bit of face value instead of my maxed heel. It manages to put itself back somehow. I don't know what crowd types are for, I never seem to know if a button is Hardcore or Family Friendly. It seems that strong reaction bouneses come up at random points.That is just with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ promo engine, I could code a better one.Backstage brawls are 65%♥♥♥♥♥♥to be honest. I ambush Cesaro in an interview, he reverses 99% OF MY MOVES. And I can't get the timing down. Not only this. But I hit a signature and a finisher on him. Which should have ended the brawl. This went on FOR 10 MINUTES OF BEING BEATEN DOWN BY CESARO AFTER I AMBUSHED HIM. You are never really able to get backstage except for a falls count anywhere/no DQ match. I don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ Roman Reigns is giving an interview with Renee Young in the middle of MY MATCH. Does Triple H have his office set up in every arena like that? The lighting is 50%♥♥♥♥♥♥and not realistic and you can't interact with 80% of the things anyway.Man I used like 5 percentages there but it gets worse...Raise your hand if you actually want Barron Blade, Jaden Jet, and every other made up star? I certainly won't be raising my hand. It's very annoying having Barron Blade hold the U.S. title and NXT Title at the same time. I was #2 contender for the U.S. title for 8 ingame months and Barron held the titles for that entire time. Brock Lesnar hasn't dropped the World Title for all 4 years In my MyCareer game so far. And why is Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose a tag team. Besides fueding 5-6 months before the game came out. A fix that could take 15 minutes? 30 minutes? But they have also held on to the tag team titles for all 4 years of my MyCareer.There is so much more but I'm tired of writing...			"

												62 hours so far of playtime. Game has crashed twice. Once with Alt-tab, another when using the options to change a wrestlers attire. Other than this, the game has ran smooth.  56-60 fps during matches, mostly sitting at 59-60  (yes included are 6 mans in and around the ring fighting.) and 30 fps entrances (both capped.) Keep in mind that the entrances can run lower , the more crap you use in them if you make you own caws entrance with all of the bells and whistles.   Few little glitches here and there with animation during matches. Other than this, everything else makes for a good wrestling game.  Edit: forgot to state the two big things I was scared about, but no longer am.  Pin lag bug (for co-op play. I don't do online.) is NOT found in this version of the game. As well as the bad FPS drops during matches with camera changes during matchs like the Xbox1 has.  Both are running smooth on my system and for that I am thankful and very happy!My system isn't anything to brag about.i5-4670kevga gtx 980 sc gpu16 gb ram.G-sync acer monitor.  It runs it smooth with all options set to max.Seeing how many pc gamers no longer understand how to read system specs, people can use mine as a reference to judge if the game will run for them. Though sometimes you still have problems due to software, not hardware.  The game is worth checking out for sure!  With steams return policy, you can't go wrong. 14 days and or 2 hours playtime. More than enough to find out if it runs on your system. I recommend this game to everyone who has either enjoyed wrestling, or have played  past wwe 2k titles. This one is a step above 2k16.  Some will agree, others will disagree. To each their own. Keep in mind, this is all from my personal opinion on the subject.			"

												2K17 can be super fun and engaging both inside and out of the ring, when it decides to not crash or bug out... All in all, it can be a fun wrastlin' game with decent mechanics for grappling, reversals, etc, but the whole experience is marred by wrestlers spawning in with missing limbs and torsos, buggy opener music for a show thats stuck on repeat and what can be constant crashing while trying to load in to a match (the majority of my crashes to desktop). And the cherry on top? An uncommon, but reoccuring issue where I try to load in to my save again after a crash only to be greeted by a ""save corrupted"" message. Not great. 2K, fix this crap. You got my money for the base game, and an additional bit of scratch for the season pass, but **** me, right? Until the listed issues are fixed, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game. Yes, the game works, but seemingly only just.As for everyone else that bought the game and are continuing to experience corrupt save files: back them up as always, but funnily enough there is a chance that the game is just stupidly throwing up false flags.

Still needs work and developement. The Universe mode needs a better interface to set things in motion in all aspects of game mode. When it comes down to the actual wrestling it's very fluid.

												For what it's worth, it's not great, that doesn't mean it's a bad game though. There's bugs and glitches around every corner, some are actually pretty funny, albeit annoying. I will say though, it hasn't crashed once (touch wood with fingers crossed)These are bugs (I'm assuming) that have been fixed on the console versions so why aren't they fixed here yet? The logo sounds during a show's intro gets very tiring after about 2 or 3 matches, my CAW's legs always clip through the ropes when I'm doing springboard/top rope moves and some times I actually get stuck in the ropes, which is kind of funny to watch another wrestler go for their finisher and miss it because they can't grab you.I'm not going to lie, the deluxe edition isn't worth it (I mean most modern of the ""superstars"" that are included in the packs should have already been included in the game) and once again having to pay to edit a superstar's stats is absolute rubbish, but I'm just a sad mark.These are just my annoyances, but it's still fun.BRING BACK GM MODE.OH YEAH, GET NEW COMMENTARY.

												I liked WWE 2k16 a lot, you can check out my review on that version, it wasn't perfect, but it was the best wrestling game in the last several years. Fast-forward to 2k17 and not a lot has changed, which is good, but I'll explain why this version is even better for me. First off, I highly recommend the game if you like wrestling games. It's one of my favorites of all time, but if you didn't like 2k16 for whatever reason, you probably won't like 2k17, but it depends. CAW, which is my favorite feature in any wrestling game, is better in most ways in 2k17 than it has ever been.I 've created about 30 wrestlers so far, so I've used it extensively. They've added a lot to every catagory (hair styles, clothes, teeth, etc...) but one HUGE disappoint for me is that you still cannot create little people. I would love to create a much shorter wrestler, but the shortest you can go is only 5'6"", which continues to bum me out year after year. How hard would it be to extend the range of heights to under 5 foot??? I want to make a dwarf dammit! Aside from that, you pick from body types and pre-made parts (arms, legs, chest, etc...) instead of using a body slider. This is a step back as it doesn't let me have the customization we once had. Gone are the days of making an incredibly huge breasted thin woman. Not that I create that type of CAW or anything...other than that, the CAW has improved in every possible way=more of everything! It still irratates me that Yukes always does this year after year. Adds something, takes away. No create-a-finisher either, in this version, but next year they'll tout it as a ""brand new never before seen feature!!!"" Love/hate relationship when it comes to Yukes.The graphics are a bit better, but some wrestlers actually look like♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to others. Not a big deal to me because I usually just use my CAWs, but you can tell some wrestlers got a little more tlc than others. Audio is pretty much poop as  Diddy's song selection is downright ""weird"" for a wrestling video game, but again, no issue, as I turn on most every wrestler's entrace as my menu music (jukebox). The commentary has been recycled for the last 5 years but it doesn't really bother me much, I'm more in this game for the actual gameplay.The gameplay is about the same as 2k16, but with slight improvments! A 2nd opportunity to reverse on certain moves, the option to change the god-awful submission system to more of a classic button mashing submission system, and the ""Break Out"" feature after the match, which allows you to further pummel a wrestler you have already beaten. I LOVE these new features. ! The game pace is still more geared towards simulation, so expect slower pacing, not blazing fast arcade pacing. Although you can change some options, and that gets us to my final point...If you don't like the game and you think it's utter ****, for the love of all that is holy and sacred in this world, CHANGE THE SETTINGS!!!! and change the balancing!!!!! I cannot emphasize this enough!!! I really did not enjoy this game that much until I changed some settings. The pacing was too slow and the time the wrestlers were stunned was way too long, which made for a very boring match! After tweaking the balance, I'm good to go, and now have a bit faster paced matches. That may not be your cup of tea, but there is plenty of settings you can change to make the match more fun for you, whatever that may be. Guys/gals, seriously, I've been playing wrestling games since NES, the settings in these Yukes titles can make a big difference.  In closing wwe 2k17 is the best we have yet on PC just don't go in expecting a No Mercy as everyone seems to do, every friggin year...ugh...in ways it's better than No Mercy,, the CAW feature alone will keep you entertained. As far as issues with crashes, rare, in my playtime only 3 times so far and it was during load, not during the middle of anything, so I never lost any data. Runs smooth maxed 60fps 24/7 on my system.***I do not play any wrestling games online mode after atrocious matches I tried to have in a much earlier version, I believe it was wwe 10 or something, spamming the same move was the name of the game. Know going in that online in any wrestling game is a low priority and it should never be bought for that, it usually does not work well at all with many people picking a wrestler who is fast and can pull off the same exact fast move, over and over, so I could care less about MP in a wrestling game			"

												It feels a bit sparse, and in my eyes it doesn't quite compare to some of the earlier games in the series. It's as though more effort went into the earlier games. I haven't played many of the WWE games in years, in fact the last one I actually owned was WWE SvR 2009. Therefore with an 8 year gap between games, the difference in quality is striking, whether this is due to the series being taken over by 2K or just a general lack of creativity among the creators. It feels very uninspired and unfinished. I understand that these guys are expected to put out a new game every year, but still.The graphics are better than 2009 etc, but that's to be expected and not something that I focus on much. It does make my PC lag pretty badly, but with a crappy little box like mine, that's more my fault than theirs.The MyCareer mode feels outright repetitive with the illusion of challenges thrown in to try and spice up the repetitive slog of match after match after match. It also bugs me that you go straight from the training facility to WWE RAW. In my second week I was put up against Brock Lesnar. There's no sense of build-up, aside from the paper-thin Championship rankings, etc. I get that this is how it's been for years now, but in previous years the Career mode had actual storylines with rivalries and choice-based branching paths. This version doesn't even have voice acting besides the commentators, the ringside announcers, and A-Train near the start. This is how it was in WWE 2005, 12 years ago! And even then, WWE 2005 had actual storylines. It feels like 2K decided to focus more on implementing larger rosters and sharp, fluid gameplay rather than making things actually entertaining.It's very jarring to have your match interrupted with an Instant Replay whenever you do something big. It's a great example of putting realism before player enjoyment. I just did the move! I know how it works! I don't need to have the pace of the match brought to a screeching halt to see it 3 more times. Save it for the post-match highlights if you need to put it somewhere. I know I can skip it, but it still throws me off, because *it doesn't happen every time you do your finisher*. You can't be prepared for it! At least you can choose to turn settings like these off.The AI is choppy at times. Every now and again you'll get thrown to the floor and your opponent will instead step out onto the apron and throw punches at thin air. Or else your teammates/opponents will get out of te ring and not try to climb back in before the 10-count. I won't mention the glitches though. Those have been around for ages and they're not getting fixed any time soon. One thing though - and I'm not sure if I messed up or if something's actually wrong, but in MyCareer mode, my created superstar's entrance music doesn't play despite me making 110% sure that it does. The post-match music works perfectly though. What gives?Also - and this is something I've seen tons of other people complain about - the game keeps crashing! I have to constantly hold thumbs that the game won't conk out when I'm in the middle of doing something important. Yesterday I spent 20+ minutes tweaking my created superstar's moveset when the game crashed out of nowhere and I lost all my progress. Seriously, there's like a 50% chance that if I try to edit my character it'll crash. And then I need to wait 5 minutes for the damn thing to boot up again (if I don't give up and play something else for a while) and run the risk of it just crashing again. The PC version has been out for nearly two months! Surely this is something that could (and should) have been fixed early on? I'd be so much happier if I could just play the damn thing. Please just fix the crashing issue and I can deal with the rest. Are we just on our own from now on? This stuff is game-breaking. People are spending serious money on a game that only works when it feels like it.It also bugs me that I can't skip cutscenes. I'm so sick of watching the RAW and SmackDown intro sequences.I do like how they can read out my full name though :P ""From Cape Town, South Africa... Adam McKay!"" I never get tired of that. I also like the roster, with the potential to buy a ton of bonus superstars (and for in-game currency too, thank god!)As I mentioned before, this game feels unfinished, making me wonder if I should have bought one of the earlier games instead. Considering that you don't really get your money's worth, I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend. There's just so much missing from previous years that were awesome! Finisher creators, Storyline creators, Career storylines, actual voice acting! I get that the game is already 40+ GB as it is, but making it seem less sparse would definitely make people enjoy it more. As it is, I feel silly for paying so much for something with not very much to offer. I feel as though I'm lumbered with it, rather than being the proud owner of my first WWE game in 8 years.It's not fun.			"

												Owned the game on Xbox One since release last year. I was really looking forward to playing and modding this game on PC, but unfortunately it is barely playable.You'll have to make a few deals with the devil to get the game to even start up. I was stuck looking at Brock Lesnar for around 10 minutes before I gained the courage to spam Alt-Tab and CTRL-Alt-Del to finally get it to load. When it does load, you're counting the seconds until it crashes; not to even mention the game crashes upon exit.Honestly, this should be removed from the store. I get that some games will be ported poorly to PC, but this is a travesty. I was lucky enough that being stuck on the startup screen didn't get ym counter over 2 hours and I was able to get my money back. Be smart before you buy this, unlike me.			"

												Game crashes constantly if you just check my upload of a match I had half the body of one of the von erics body is missing! I payed a lot of money for this game and am really considering refunding it! I think steam needs to stop allowing 2k to sell there broken games on here. 2016 was really good had no issues with it except for crashes when you made a new custom superstar. The mechanics of the game are wondeful if not for all the bugs and not to mention all the random crashes and like many that have stated the audio issues still remain, we had a recent update which took them two months to do and idk what it did but seems like it did nothing... The game would be wonderful if they would fix the bugs but so far its been unplayable... I suggest waiting for 2018 hopefully everything will be fixed in that game but if you want to try it wait for when the price goes down to nothing cus that's what this game is worth right now nothing...

												I cannot, in good conscience, recommend WWE 2K17 in its current state.  It's a complete crashfest, and there hasn't been any updates or hotfixes, however minor, released.  I don't get much FPS dips (I play with FXAA on, MSAA off, Textures high, audience density high but tessalation off, locked at a better framerate, and no Entrances/camera cuts or in-match replays, and no camera shakes).  In matches, even if it's a 6-man match, I get fluid FPS.  But it crashes randomly, at no set interval in a match (sometimes early on, sometimes just before that final pincount).  I get crashes loading into certain creation areas - I don't crash in move-sets, entrances or arenas, but have consistently inconsistent crashes simply editing a wrestler (and it's never while I'm editing, it's just when it's loading into it).  This happens to both original superstars and WWE superstars.The game, itself, as a game, is really good.  I've only done exhibition matches and creation stuff (CAWs, Arenas, Videos) because I'm waiting for some kind of stability update *if any* before I really dig in.I tried to go back to 2K16 after frustrations of crashes, but it's just not as fun as I've found 2K17 to be.I'll update this review if the game gets some tender love and care, but until then, I don't recommend supporting a game that's in this state.  I'm kinda sour I did, because now I can't enjoy 2K16 knowing how much better 2K17 is, in terms of gameplay, graphics, roster and creation stuffs...Oddly enough, Ladder Matches work this year.  2K16 had the notorious bug that would slow gameplay when the hanging belt was touched in a Ladder Match.  I'm pleased to say, despite crashes, 2k17 DOES NOT have this issue.			"

												In the game's current state I can't recommend.Firstly let me point out I am a big fan of WWE and all their games, but below is a list of everything I encounter everytime I play the game.The only mode I play at the moment is career mode, so these are the current bugs I've seen. When the show intro finishes playing (NXT, Raw, Smackdown etc) I get a strange sound play repeatedly while commentary introduce the show (similar to the sound you get when it is loading the avatars of the next match) Sometimes when I win a match and attack after match (heel obviously) my entrance music will begin playing twice. Game will be all happy then if I go to change my superstar's appearence NO.EXE the game shuts down no longer responding. AI likes to run around in circles or just freeze on the spot from time to time.I don't get how this can happen with this port after 4 months of prep from console release, hopefully we get a patch that fixes all this.

												They're beginning to do things right, but that doesn't mean it's still good. If you're looking for single player or sandbox, buy this game, they do that very well. But DO NOT buy this game for multiplayer. It's a buggy, laggy mess. Once in a match, which can take hours to find, the frames drop to about 10, there's constant connection problems, and practically everything is delayed. On the fourms it looks like they're getting a huge amount of complaints about this, and not doing anything about it. (Did I forget to mention you have to pay in order to download custom superstars?)So...Buy - If you're looking for single player or sandbox (universe)Don't buy - If you're looking for any kind of online play.

												First things first, I have to say that this. like every other WWE game on the PC will have FPS problems. Look up ways to fix it. It's pretty easy, honestly. But the problems occured with a laptop suitable for gaming at these high-end graphics. I recommend this game because it is fun and soley that. The character customization is great, and if you have a good pc for it, it's faster than any of the previous games. Worth the buy if that's why annoyed you.There's also more things added to the game, such as being able to have your own victory sequence and titantron video (you can create that.) But I will say that you will like it more if you are an actual WWE fan.			"

I've actually managed to do some matches and really enjoyed them but I can't do more than 2 matches before it crashes.This game needs some serious fixing with the crashes and the framerate before I can give a positive review.

Did 2 finishers and signatures on him and he still kicked out at 2.Received superman punch and spear and I got pinned.10/10 for realism.The promo introduction is great and also the fights backstages and at the croud.Best game of the series so far.Totally 8.5/10			"

												I’m a HUGE WWE fan and even bigger WWE game fan (Spent 100+ hrs on 2k16). But this game is currently unplayable for me. This game crashes constantly, specifically in Universe mode and MyCareer during the load screen before entrances and during matches.Minus the crashing issues, this is the best 2k WWE game I've played. I played this on PS4 and it’s the best wrestling simulation I’ve experienced.  From the revamped Universe mode, the introduction to promos and CAW customizations.Until they address this issue and patch the game, thumbs down.			"

												When I purchased this game, I purchased the special edition. There were 2 things I wanted to do more than anything else: play as Shinsuke Nakamura and create myself as acustom character with all the bells and whistles, Specificly with naming. How is it that in this game there is absolutly NO options to have ring announcers do piece-together names? I'm sorry I don't have a generic last name like most people, but that shouldn't mean I have to suffer with being painfully average. Not only that, but there arn't even gimmick names for announcers. Are you kidding me? I'm going to say that I can recomend the game as far as it's  gameplay is concerned, but the customization is a joke. I shouldn't have to scavage online for mods to add in certain dialogue to make the game more customizable. I will be updating this as I play more, but I doubt it will be positive.Edit: I will never recommend this game. EVER. My main regret is that I can't get a refund now that I've spent to long trying top make customization work. I spent half an hour trying to pin Roman Reigns with a custom character. For starters, the finisher I gave my character (spear 5) would never give me an option to use it unless I was outside the ring. Also, roman had been in the red for the majority of the match and bleeding and he still couldnt be pinned. Worse, after getting half my moves countered, he made a full comeback that I couldn't reverse with infinite reversals on. keep in mind that this was on normal difficulty and i had retried this match 3-4 times with the same result: noise complaints from my neighbors and dents in my tower.Before i move on to this part, i'd like to preface this with the mention that i play wiht an Xbox One controller. I took a break for a few days and, would you believe it, this game gets worse. Now I have my characters finishers re-edited to fit what I was originally going for and now I find out just how pathetic the submission system is. For those unawware, the submission mini game for submissions is basicly a 2D version of tag, except you have to hold on to win, and the opposition has to avoid you to win. The controles move slower than california highway traffic, so you basicly lose the submission game every time. The game essentialy makes tells you ""play how we want you to, or you're going to have a bad time."" Thanks 2K for once again providing a lack-luster experiance for top quality prices.			"

												TL;DROverall:If you love WWE - Buy this game.If you hate WWE - Buy this game.If you neither hate or love WWE - Buy this game.If you know nothing about wrestling - Buy this game.If you are interested in wrestling - Buy this game.If you like RPGs - Buy this game.If you like Simulators - Buy this game.If you like games - Buy this game.Fantastic game. Massive improvements over both 2k15 and 16. 2K15 was pretty bad but due to the fact that it was the first WWE game on steam for AGES, it was pretty good. 2K16 came along and it was better than 2k15, but it had reasonably limited features which only pale in comparison to the features of 2k17. 2K17 is 10 steps closer to having WWE games like they used to be (Smackdown vs Raw etc). Fantastic features, great DLC, which isn't sold at unreasonable prices, the career mode is by far the best yet. There's so much customisation in this game, you can essentially change anything you'd want to change about your character. You can fine tune their skills and abilities to your likings.ALSO YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME ON HARD OR LEGENDARY OTHERWISE IT IS NOT NEARLY AS FUN. Hard mode is where the AI shines and when the game really becomes an RPG Simulation. It's fantastic.AI is, for the most part, intelligent and the changes to ladder matches and the introduction of backstage brawls is fantastic. "

												* GRAPHICS*The game run's very well, and looks very beautifull.You can see that next to awesome up to date graphics itself, they really have done their absolute best to make every wrestler behave as they do on the real SHOW.I have'nt played Wrestling Games for years, and this is the first time i see it as detailed as this.The entrance of wrestlers is Super Detailed, including commentary, and music, fireworks TAUNTS, Faces and emotions are LifeLike, there movements are all there till the smallest detail, i was reallly blown away compared to the last wrestlergame i have spend time on.* GRAPHIC OPTIONS*There are however not many options to tune the game, this means that when the game won't run great on someonethere system specs, they can barely do anything to Tune it- You can lower Resolution- Disable FXAA- Enable MSAA ( or disable it too ).- Shadows can be changed.- You can decrease the density of the crowd.And as far as i can remember right now that is about it !Yes you can put Depth of Field and Motion Blur to Disable, because they have initially enabled it.But i can not call that graphics options anyway, because both of teh  last are 2 effects that should not even be inserted to Video Games at all , simply because they look r.etarded and ugly.It comes down that for optimization there barely has been done anything by the developers.As much time as they spend on the detail of the wrestlers and graphics, so few time they  have used to optimize some parts, ESPECIALLY the entrance, or when you get close to the crowd the game takes HUGE Performance drops.While none of these crowd people are really that detailed !There is absolutely no reason why some random people with almost flat facial expression compared to wrestlers should be causing so much issues for people, and the LIGHTING is a great deal of the crowd problem too.But they just can not be tuned at all.During Gameplay it runs 60 FPS, but when you walk out of the ring and even if it just renders 10 crowd people the game insanely drops FPS when the camera angle changes for a short moment during a move special.Even though that may be just a few sceonds, it is proof they didn't spend any time on optimization there.A Half arsed baked CHocoLate Cookie ,    but without the chocolate !!!!I run this on a GTX1080 with a decent i7 4770k CPU and 32GB of System Ram, at a resolution of 3840x2160 it run's 60 FPS for all the other parts, but just enabing Transparency SuperSampling in Config Panel of NVIDIA, or even using the slightly increased Dynamic Super Resolution of 4207x2366 Completelt screws the game to as low as 10 FPS in the crowd or 30 FPS locked during matches.When i compare that to a game like the very recently released Resient Evil 7 ( Which looks at least 4 x as detailed but still plays smooth at the same time even with DSR enabled ) I can only make one conclusion, and that is they had no money left to Finish the Game optimization and they just left the problems like the croud issue in it.Personally i can just do a step back and disable the Transparency Super SAmpling or DSR.But those are extra's i enabled in the Config panel to work together with the MSAA ingame.Anyone that already has performance issues let's call it out of the BOX, is pretty much screwed by 2K's dev team.In all honesty 2K have not optimized the crowd to even be watched in 2K, even then tehre are frame drops, let alone to watch them in 4K. During GamePlay the game Plays well at 60 and over, but still for a game that asks Full Price & has ton of download content or Season Pass, that is very unacceptable. They should be forced by teh community to fix the PC issues, because right now a big 40 to 50 % have no options they can tune to make the game run better.A wrestling game should be able to be played by even LapTop players, like a FIFA Soccer, or a NBA Basketball.But they just stopped somewhere in the process, they just called it and decided to start selling it to maximize the PROFIT instead of delivering an at least 95% seamless experience overall.* GAMEPLAY *The gameplay has more issues, the great way the wrestlers are detailed is awesome, but the gameplay , blerghhhh.I played wrestling games in the PS 1 Era, and it is a 100% Fact that those games a 17 YEARS AGOOOO, played sooo much and much betterr !!!!!The gameplay is silly and a weak excuse for what wrestling once used to be in gaming.THERE IS NO INGAME TUTORIAL >>>  Instead they redirect you to there website to read the game MAnual there.Even when you figured it out yourself because i can not be ARSED into the gawdDAMN game to launch my browseer.But even after that you will have to put up with a SILLY counter System.That would not even be really bad, if it would react properly, but 7 out of the 10 times the time frame for pressing RT and escape or counter DOES NOT react at all. I tested it many times, and in 70% input does not get registered, it just shows to late or to early, or even worse even when pressed correctly, it does not register at ALL.The Pinfall System is even worse, a fast moving circle where you have 2 chances of clicking on teh right moment.It is so fucn precise that even if your press is just 0.2 seconds off, you are screwed.R.etarded systems like that are just a simple interruption of the fight instead then they feel liek fighting.But 2 K   managed to completely R.A.P.E. whatever was left of wrestling in PC gaming.The insane amount of combo's and fun you could have back then, is ruined by realistic things.But Realistic things that have been implemented very UNREALISTIC !I don't want  to play on easy, i want to play on HARD or above !They should remove 2K from the concept, a worthless team, with worthless developers, that have not tested it at all.I play games like Mortal Kombat, or original Devil May Cry series, everyone knows how much combo's and precise timing come's into play there. And that is a fun thing, but when a system starts to interrupt gameplay and teh fluid movement of a battle, you really know someone ♥♥♥♥ed up the development.Even when you get used to it and learnt to focus at enemie movement instead of the RT trigger appearing, even then it stays a silly dumb mechanic that prevents people to have fun within the fight.Fighting on the PS 1  was fun smooth fluid, and maybe honestly a little simplistic.But 2017 is just a Checklist after checklist, having fun interrupted by CHEAP QUICKTIME events.I am not exxaggerating here, but at least 50 % is quicktime, you can not counter without this system.You can not escape Pinfall without pressing a moving bar inside a circle.Anyone that thinks this is a Good game with realistic gameplay.Should quickly shove his head in the sand and start shaming on theirselves.because they clearly have never ever been playing a GOOD game with good gameplay before !

												* GRAPHICS*The game run's very well, and looks very beautifull.You can see that next to awesome up to date graphics itself, they really have done their absolute best to make every wrestler behave as they do on the real SHOW.I have'nt played Wrestling Games for years, and this is the first time i see it as detailed as this.The entrance of wrestlers is Super Detailed, including commentary, and music, fireworks TAUNTS, Faces and emotions are LifeLike, there movements are all there till the smallest detail, i was reallly blown away compared to the last wrestlergame i have spend time on.* GRAPHIC OPTIONS*There are however not many options to tune the game, this means that when the game won't run great on someonethere system specs, they can barely do anything to Tune it- You can lower Resolution- Disable FXAA- Enable MSAA ( or disable it too ).- Shadows can be changed.- You can decrease the density of the crowd.And as far as i can remember right now that is about it !Yes you can put Depth of Field and Motion Blur to Disable, because they have initially enabled it.But i can not call that graphics options anyway, because both of teh  last are 2 effects that should not even be inserted to Video Games at all , simply because they look r.etarded and ugly.It comes down that for optimization there barely has been done anything by the developers.As much time as they spend on the detail of the wrestlers and graphics, so few time they  have used to optimize some parts, ESPECIALLY the entrance, or when you get close to the crowd the game takes HUGE Performance drops.While none of these crowd people are really that detailed !There is absolutely no reason why some random people with almost flat facial expression compared to wrestlers should be causing so much issues for people, and the LIGHTING is a great deal of the crowd problem too.But they just can not be tuned at all.During Gameplay it runs 60 FPS, but when you walk out of the ring and even if it just renders 10 crowd people the game insanely drops FPS when the camera angle changes for a short moment during a move special.Even though that may be just a few sceonds, it is proof they didn't spend any time on optimization there.A Half arsed baked CHocoLate Cookie ,    but without the chocolate !!!!I run this on a GTX1080 with a decent i7 4770k CPU and 32GB of System Ram, at a resolution of 3840x2160 it run's 60 FPS for all the other parts, but just enabing Transparency SuperSampling in Config Panel of NVIDIA, or even using the slightly increased Dynamic Super Resolution of 4207x2366 Completelt screws the game to as low as 10 FPS in the crowd or 30 FPS locked during matches.When i compare that to a game like the very recently released Resient Evil 7 ( Which looks at least 4 x as detailed but still plays smooth at the same time even with DSR enabled ) I can only make one conclusion, and that is they had no money left to Finish the Game optimization and they just left the problems like the croud issue in it.Personally i can just do a step back and disable the Transparency Super SAmpling or DSR.But those are extra's i enabled in the Config panel to work together with the MSAA ingame.Anyone that already has performance issues let's call it out of the BOX, is pretty much screwed by 2K's dev team.In all honesty 2K have not optimized the crowd to even be watched in 2K, even then tehre are frame drops, let alone to watch them in 4K. During GamePlay the game Plays well at 60 and over, but still for a game that asks Full Price & has ton of download content or Season Pass, that is very unacceptable. They should be forced by teh community to fix the PC issues, because right now a big 40 to 50 % have no options they can tune to make the game run better.A wrestling game should be able to be played by even LapTop players, like a FIFA Soccer, or a NBA Basketball.But they just stopped somewhere in the process, they just called it and decided to start selling it to maximize the PROFIT instead of delivering an at least 95% seamless experience overall.* GAMEPLAY *The gameplay has more issues, the great way the wrestlers are detailed is awesome, but the gameplay , blerghhhh.I played wrestling games in the PS 1 Era, and it is a 100% Fact that those games a 17 YEARS AGOOOO, played sooo much and much betterr !!!!!The gameplay is silly and a weak excuse for what wrestling once used to be in gaming.THERE IS NO INGAME TUTORIAL >>>  Instead they redirect you to there website to read the game MAnual there.Even when you figured it out yourself because i can not be ARSED into the gawdDAMN game to launch my browseer.But even after that you will have to put up with a SILLY counter System.That would not even be really bad, if it would react properly, but 7 out of the 10 times the time frame for pressing RT and escape or counter DOES NOT react at all. I tested it many times, and in 70% input does not get registered, it just shows to late or to early, or even worse even when pressed correctly, it does not register at ALL.The Pinfall System is even worse, a fast moving circle where you have 2 chances of clicking on teh right moment.It is so fucn precise that even if your press is just 0.2 seconds off, you are screwed.R.etarded systems like that are just a simple interruption of the fight instead then they feel liek fighting.But 2 K   managed to completely R.A.P.E. whatever was left of wrestling in PC gaming.The insane amount of combo's and fun you could have back then, is ruined by realistic things.But Realistic things that have been implemented very UNREALISTIC !I don't want  to play on easy, i want to play on HARD or above !They should remove 2K from the concept, a worthless team, with worthless developers, that have not tested it at all.I play games like Mortal Kombat, or original Devil May Cry series, everyone knows how much combo's and precise timing come's into play there. And that is a fun thing, but when a system starts to interrupt gameplay and teh fluid movement of a battle, you really know someone ♥♥♥♥ed up the development.Even when you get used to it and learnt to focus at enemie movement instead of the RT trigger appearing, even then it stays a silly dumb mechanic that prevents people to have fun within the fight.Fighting on the PS 1  was fun smooth fluid, and maybe honestly a little simplistic.But 2017 is just a Checklist after checklist, having fun interrupted by CHEAP QUICKTIME events.I am not exxaggerating here, but at least 50 % is quicktime, you can not counter without this system.You can not escape Pinfall without pressing a moving bar inside a circle.Anyone that thinks this is a Good game with realistic gameplay.Should quickly shove his head in the sand and start shaming on theirselves.because they clearly have never ever been playing a GOOD game with good gameplay before !

												Bought this game yesterday... The only thing decent about the computer version is the universal mode. PC version not good for playing or watching because of the lagging, and the choppiness of the graphics. I have two top of the line devices that can play heavy graphic games, but this games is bad on both. Tried watching a match in universal mode, and it takes about 30 or more minutes to watch a short match, because of everyone moving in slow motion. This is after all the graphics setting set to the lowest possible settings.  This game does not translate well for the PC. If they can fix that issue, then it would be great, but otherwise, if you want this game, get the console version.			"

												I would absolutely love to be able to recommend this game, I love all the new features this brings to the table as opposed to previous 2K games, but the constant crashing is unbearable, only compounded by the fact that Career mode is borderline unplayable in it's current state. It's just another PC port, and until it gets patched it's disgustingly unplayable.			"

												I feel this game is not as good as I had hoped for. While some of the move set are really nice and look cool, the complete lack of a basic control tutorial in-game is badly needed. Also, some finishers first require you to properly position you opponent and until that is done the finisher will never trigger, I would have liked for finishers to do all the setup needed to perform the move rather than having the player to do it all.Also, I almost always missed the reversal prompt, and the cpu would constantly reverse my attacks, grapple, and finishers/signature moves, so I almost always lost on the matches. Finally, the submission system is extremely hard, you can easily loose a match you dominated, if the cpu performs a submission move. Overall, I find it too difficult to play and win, and therefore would not recommend this game.			"

												I want to like this game. I want to play it. But I can't, because it's just barely playable. It seems like it has potential to be good with intensive bug fixes, but in it's current state it's hard to believe that they charge money for it.This game feels like an unfinished port. I have zero issues running graphics intensive games on highest settings, but this game struggles on low settings if there's more than two wrestlers on the screen at once.The last WWE game I played was '13, and I seem to remember that game having a significantly better creation suite. I'm shocked that I can't design character with as much detail as I could in '13. Gameplay wise I've had several moments where I've just had to shut off the game due to frustration, sometimes due to glitches and performance issues, and other times due to actual design features that defy logical thought. There are aspects of the game design that feel as if their sole purpose is to mock you for buying the game.I can only think that the reason these games sell at all is because the WWE brand is attached to them.

												Desolate, uninspired, just plain lazy. More of the same from 2k. Weirdly, it's essentially the same game as the previous iterations but somehow less enjoyable? Buggy as hell and continuous lags on gtx1070. This is not a good game. Maybe I'm fatigued with the series in general but boy is this a joyless experience. Whatever magic WWE has ever managed to create has been sucked right out of this lifeless turd. Wait for 75% off - nothing less. But, if you're like me - A lifelong WWE fan - You're used to swallowing garbage and liking it. Look hard enough and I'm sure you'll find something not dreadful about the game. Personally, I couldn't but best of luck to you.			"

												I'll start off with the positive. I DO like this game. Several hours into it and already I've seen enough content to say that it's vastly improved from WWE 2k16, which was my favourite wrestling game since SvR 2008. And the beauty of it is I have only scraped the surface!However.What makes this a negative view is the release itself. 5 months late into the party - we wait patiently for the THIRD time in a row. Alright, good job 2K games, you ported it quicker this time. But still 5 months.... and guess what? We have to purchase the DLC's, even the simple ones like the accelerator or the NXT booster. I'd happily purchase them, IF the game came out on PC at the same time (or at least near enough!) as the console releases. Sure, we get Goldberg. Mkay. As epic as he is, it still feels like 2K is being greedier than ever this year round.Buy if you don't care for buying the DLC's (fortunately i don't), or don't care about the whole situation. The content itself is wonderful. But if the way a game company handles it's releases effects your decision on paying for a game or not, then hold onto your wallet with this one.			"

												Lame game, not any better than last years game.  Filled with bugs, the promos are cheesy and stupid, the game play hasn't at all been improved..you can't skip the stupid videos in Universe mode, no diva's in mycarrer mode.  My career mode is 10x worse than it was last year...if I wanted to spend time 'talking' in a game, I'd just get on my headset and talk there.The create an entrance video is nice, but the game freezes up when you assign it to a character.  Overall, I give the game 3 out of 10 overall.  I wasn't even going to buy this, but I heard favorable reviews..they were wrong.  Last WWE game I will ever purchase.			"

												I like wrestling games a lot and this seems like a great one and a good follow up to WWE2k16. But I can't give a thumbs up just yet. My computer is above all recommended specs except the video card which is a GTX 745 instead of the recc. 770. There can't be this much lag/fps drops because of this... my in game graphics are set way down too and set my video card to performance settings. It's very irritating. When a fix comes, thumbs up all the way. Everything else is just great. Buyer beware. My opinion may have been differnt thus far had I not paid $72cdn which included all the extras and stuff on pre-order.			"

												The game won't even start for me. It just runs in the background and nothing happens. Several people are having this problem, even on high-end rigs (mine plays FO4 on Ultra). Of the people who CAN run it, widespread reports of bugs from start to finish. As usual, Yuke's has released a buggy mess just like every year.  Avoid this series as long as their busted code is dragging it down.			"

I spent more time building up the perfect world in TEW whereas in this game, paywall for the titles and superstars. Gone are the days where i can just unlock all at once without any issue. Do not buy this game, save your money and get 2K16 and download the stars you want, I'm saving your life and your wallet.			"

												Originally, I gave this game a thumbs up but I have changed my mind. Here's why.The game has been out for a month already yet 2K hasn't release a patch to fix the FPS problems and other bugs (annoying bug like 2 music playing at the same time in menu). I mean, WOW! this game released after consoles like 4 months and they couldn't even release a polished PC version. Not to mention that this game NOT worth an upgrade if you already own WWE2K16. This game has worse version of CAW. Performance problem (way lagger than 2K16 but can barely see any differences in graphics). Ugly looking menu. No 2K showcase (not counting the crappy HOF showcase that comes with season pass). I have played every WWE games since Here Comes the Pain. The is one of the worst installment that have released so far (after 2K15 which is really bad). Wait for deep sale if you can. Hopefully, 2K will care enough to fix the game by then.			"

												I don't care about the crashing, it never does that for me.But i just can not win a frikin match. The submission mini game always gets me, because i can never remember that i have to hold that othe rbutton to move it.In my career the dude just beats me up and i cannot do ANYTHING about it, i just lose. Also in my career, i got my first opponent down to almost no health, but he kept kicking out. This was in the performance center my god! So he would just end up pinning me somehow. By the itme I'd have made it to NXT, it would just put me up againt some dude that has an overall 10 more points than me.Then i still don't know why you can only download 20 things every day. When by paying stuff for MyCareer you eventually delete that save 5 minutes later because it is crap and you get no vc back. And why i can never reverse things even if i click it if it lasts for 10 second and i click it on 5.So, crap, can't do a thing but have broken a part of my keyboard. :(I don't think i need more time on it eaither because i am great at it on my Ps3. But that might not be the case since 2K wants to force me to pay $400 for a console i do not need in order to get a ""better"" version. "

												WWE 2K17 improves upon the formula created back in 2K15, with new additions pushing the boundaries of the wrestling sim genre. While this is a positive for fans of the style, and of WWE's product, it may not be to everyone's liking.WWE 2K17 continues on from the previous two iterations of the game, further stepping away from the arcade style on display in earlier titles like the Smackdown VS Raw series. While this is not really news to most people, there will be still be some who decide to jump back into the world of WWE games through this release. 2K17 much like the previous two games, requires a more strategic approach, gone are infinite reversals and unlimited stamina. While I feel that this adds a lot of depth to the actual gameplay, it can put more casual players off.The gameplay itself is continually becoming more and more refined with each year, the animations are smooth, the bumps look real. The new taunt systems helps add more realism to each match, allowing taunts to be aimed at the crowd, and letting wrestlers climb on the turnbuckle to stand triumphant, the submission mini-game and pin system remain the same from the previous two games, but are still strong and balanced enough that it's not much of a problem. Multi-man matches are much better in 2K17 in comparison to pretty much all of the other WWE titles, instead of being a cluttered mess, this time around, once taking a substantial amount of damage, much like on TV, superstars will roll out of the ring and remain outside in order to rest, before climbing back in to resume the brawl. This does help to immerse you in the experience, and helps make multi-superstar matches much cleaner, and more enjoyable. However, there is still a limit of only six superstars at one time, which I would like to see changed, but you can understand why the limit is in place, considering the limited resources that consoles have, given that this is a port. One major negative point about this game is that, much like all other WWE 2K titles, it is rife with bugs. Be it glitches in matches, or the game crashing altogether (Which has happened pretty frequently with me, only while running in fullscreen though.) The only positive thing i have to say about ths is that the black ring glitch from 2K16 seems to have been fixed as I have not experienced it at all with this title.Career mode is a definite improvement over 2k16's as the roster feels more alive this time around. In the previous iteration, the career mode worked like this. If you were face, Seth Rollins was WWE champion, If you were heel, Brock Lesnar held the gold. This time, it feels more alive, as I have seen titles change at Pay Per Views etc. Imagine the career mode as a modified universe mode to a degree. One of the most significant changes in the career mode is that 2K have tried to make their product feel like a genuine WWE show. Before each show the intro video for the show plays (Be it Smackdown, Raw, NXT, Superstars, Main Event.) and you watch the pyro on the main stage etc. The novelty wears off after a while, but it does help to immerse you in the experience.The character creation is still great, with more new content than 2K16, nothing much more to really talk about regarding this. It's pretty good!No showcase mode in the base game, they are adding it via DLC, which personally doesn't bother me, there is enough content in the game to make it worthwhile without the showcase mode. A quick side note, this is the first WWE PC title to  include the paid DLC. Previously all DLC was lumped in with the game, while I've not purchased any yet, and am still unsure if I will or not, there is enough content in the vanilla game without having to purchase any extra DLC. Plus, the online creations are still available for free, so you can always just download any missing superstars. One final thing to mention, this game was in development long before the whole brand split stuff that happened on TV, as a result it was already outdated from the moment it launched unfortunately, you can fix this in universe mode through downloading custom arenas etc.So, Should you buy WWE2K17? Yes, I think so. It's a solid addition to the WWE 2K Franchise, while not being particularly groundbreaking, it does solidify on a lot of the changes made in 2K16, while adding some spice of its own.PLUS IT FINALLY HAS AJ STYLES.

I'm not a huge online multiplayer so, i haven't tested that enough to be able to complain much. Universe mode is fun, The Roster is fantastic, and I'm slowly working my way through Career. I can't think of too much i'd adjust. I'm also fine with paying for the DLC - We've been getting lucky for a while now so I'm not horribly surprised we're finally having to pay for it. I'd wait for it to come down in price a bit, but otherwise it's a fun game as always.			"

												So the last rasslin' game I played was WWE 2k15, and this is an immense improvement over that.  I played a lot of PS1/2/3/4 rasslin games too, and I think with 2k17 they are finally getting back to the expectations that those titles from many years ago set for me.THE GOOD:- all the mini-games are great, I'm a big fan of the submission system.  They're not too complicated but they feel skillfull and thankfully there's no button mashing.  No more being at the mercy of simple dice rolls to determine the outcome of the match, now I can get good at stuff and feel like I actually won or lost.  It makes the whole thing feel more gamey.- character abilities so far have led a very satisfying air of strategy to matches.  It's nothing too complex, but I do find myself using strategies to get 5 star matches while avoiding a loss.  This whole part feels a bit more fleshed out and better thought out than it did in 2k15.- the game is a lot more clear about how to get 5 star matches, and it lets you know how well you're doing on that during the match.  This goes hand in hand with my previous comment because it really shapes my choices during the match.  If I'm on the verge of getting five stars I might pull some risky stuff for a great match and try to be clever with the use of my wrestler's abilities to mitigate the risk.  Sometimes it backfires on me and I have to adjust to a losing situation - have had some very exciting match endings because of this!- character creater has so many options it's silly.  In fact, some of the things you can put on your character are kind of silly.  Everything looks great too - I've basically made the same guy in every rasslin' game I ever played, but this time around he looks the coolest!  In fact, he looks more like an actual guy than some of the actual wrestlers in the game do - first time I've seen created wrestlers look more high def than the real guys lol- Career mode is hugely improved.  Things started kicking off immediately - a few matches in I was slowly on my way to a title, and part of a rivalry.  Lots of little interactions happen in between of matches as well, and overall you get a lot more options to interact with your career.  Compared to the nothing that was the 2k15 career mode, this is pretty fantastic and was the one part of the game where I really wanted to see some improvement.THE OKAY- I'm a bit half and half on the reversal system.  It feels like having more reversals than your opponent is just such a hard numerical advantage because once he's done reversing, you still can.  End result: you are in charge of the match every time an exchanges of reversals end. I would have liked to see some more mechanics that allow you to get reversals back to sort of break this pattern.  Certain reversals being able to lockout your opponents reversals temporarily is a start - but again, works better for the wrestler who has more reversals.- the promo system, where your character walks out to the ring and flaps their jaw, or gets into some verbal sparring with another wrestler is on the one hand a really exciting mechanic for the game.  However, the choices feel really cryptic like the little chunk of preview text you choose doesn't always let you know what your character is really going to say.  The fact that you have to match up both your general tone on various subjects along with a face/heel image in order to get a strong reaction out of the current type of crowd means those choices need to be pretty clear.  I pick something that I think is gonna be a nice friendly face comment for a family friendly crowd, and next thing you know I'm being a huge heel.THE BAD- character creater doesn't have body morphing sliders ( or if there are any I haven't found them ) which reduces the ability to really fine tune your created wrestlers.- I have pretty decent hardware and I had to fiddle with graphics settings to get the game running smoothly.  I still basically have graphics settings maxed though, so everything looks fantastic.  Overall it runs great though - feels generalyl more responsive than 2k15.			"

However, the bugs, crashes, and inconsistencies throughout make for too many unenjoyable moments.  I suggest waiting for (if ever) 2K to patch the PC version before buying.  I contemplated whether or not to recommend this game for a long few minutes.  While I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state, it *is* the only wrestling game out there, so...			"

												Good WWE game, doesnt crash often but does at some rare occasion , but never crashed while I was in an actual match.in 25+ hours of gameplay I crashed maybe like 2 or 3 times for no reason though. The game do have some bugs, but they doesnt make the game unplayable. I recommend the game.			"

												As someone who's played nearly all the WWE games since 2002's ""Shut Your Mouth"", I can say that this is definitely one of the better games of the series, and definitely a step up from 2K's other wrestling endeavours.To begin, I get very few performance issues on any game I play, so that means 2K17 is no different. In 25 hours of play, the game has crashed once, and I occasionally get some FPS stutter, but other than that, and the other random glitches you get in a 2K wrestling game, I didn't have any issues in that department.Ever since I started playing wrestling games, I've always played them for the story mode. In Shut Your Mouth and Here Comes the Pain, it was the brilliant Season mode, in 2011 it was the Road to Wrestlemanias, and in 2K's next-gen videogames, it's MyCareer, their vision for the player to be able to recreate what it's like for a WWE superstar to rise up from humble beginnings and become a main eventer, all while relatively keeping kayfabe in check. MyCareer has, for the most part, been nearly exclusively what I've played in 2K's games. In 2015, it was a barebones excuse of a broken system that occasionally produced interesting feuds every ten hours. In 2016, it fixed many of those problems, although these ""fixes"" included 8 redudant matches followed by 1 semi-important match to a feud that was destined to go nowhere, along with title systems that didn't work. In 2K17, these problems are fixed. Not only do you have variety in how feuds start, end, and their length, but you can now challenge for titles much earlier, have much more control over what happens, and a re-balancing of attributes and difficulty makes these matches a genuine challenge while still being close enough and interesting enough to be riveting. You feel a genuine character progression with your CAW, through promos, championship wins, and where his spot on the card happens to land every week. Now, only occasionally do the eight matches between PPVs feel tedious, unlike 2K16, where they almost always did. My primary complaints lie in the fact that the customization suite doesn't seem to be as detailed as last years, at least for CAWs. Overall, though, there does seem to be more content within the game, including an absolutely massive roster and many different arenas. With that being said, DLC that was free last year will cost you $30 this year, as will some basic features that were available last year. The only reason I can look over this is because I think all the other items in the Season Pass are definitely worth $30, and as an avid fan of WWE, I'm willing to pay that much money for the product. Considering that it was FREE last year, however, does make me slightly sour.Considering all my experiences I've had in the 25 hours I've played so far, I'd recommend a buy. But try your best to make sure you can also buy the season pass, too. If you don't, you miss out on very valuable roster members, including Eddie Guerrero, Tye Dillinger, and the Club, along with basic functions such as editing the stats of pre-existing wrestlers. If you can get over that small detail and have enough money to spend on this game, the combination of MyCareer and a fun wrestling sim will be enough to hold you over for quite a while.			"

												2K17 is definitely a welcome addition. It still has its flaws, but what game doesn't? It's an improvement over 2K16 and 2K15, for sure. Carrer mode still needs to be tweaked out. Still a bummer that it's more or less the same as it has been the past couple games. Other than that, I dig it. I'd wait until it goes on sale, though, in all honesty.			"

												Pros:1) The game runs great. Very smooth graphics running UHD off an NVidia 970.2) The sound and feel is well done. It feels like you are taking hits, and giving them. Very tactile.3) Its quite immersive and fun to play.4) Play customization is on point. Crisp designs and some interesting combinations can be achieved. Very customizable look and feel, overall.Cons:1) Way too many load screens and the break up of the recorded WWE stock video get old quick.2) The controls using an XBOX One controller are at times nimble, and other times non responsive. Click on the controller appears to have lag input at moments. For example, you have to click to release a pin, but sometimes i press before the wheel goes into green, and the game shows me selecting after passing the green butter zone. Other times, during the defensive return sessions (press right trigger by default), the indicator only lasts a second and even if you press, it either doesnt register in the game, or it registers as too late. Very frustrating in general and easily aids in the CPU winning matches.3) The game appears to have some kind of bug in the Tag Team mode. If you tag out, you will be unable to easily tag in. Again, on the controller, the Right Button doubles as your entrance into the ring and as the tag button. So when you are outside the ring, you wont get a tag. Ever. You will either enter the ring for no reason, or you will drop to the floor beside the ring. I find myself wandering over to the CPUs partner and roughing him up while my CPU partner does the work inside the ring.bottom line - I recommend this game but understand the controller drawbacks. It kind of brings back a feeling of nostalgia, for me, playing Wrestlemania and a like in my youth. It does get frustrating when the interrupt abilities are lagging to your response, because often times it means game over and you lose.			"

												As a casual wrestling gamer I honestly haven't noticed that much of a change from the previous game to this one, yeah sure the roster has been updated and there are a couple of more noticeable features that the previous release didn't have, however if you're asking me whether you can justify almost 80 Australian dollars on this game I honestly don't know if I could give you a definitive yes. Career mode still feels like a bit of an endless grind, they certainly made improvements from the previous game in relation to the career mode but it still nowhere near as good as you find in other sports games such is NBA 2K17 and now FIFA 17. Customisation wise I actually feel like they've gone backwards, when creating a custom superstar you can no longer select from premade faces, it's now entirely up to you to supply any kind of individuality to your CAW, the pre-selected attire is still restrictive to say the least, the one thing I will give about the player customisation is the hair you can assign to your custom superstar finally looks halfway to being realistic but is still nowhere near acceptable for a 5 star game. From a mechanics point of view the game still feels laggy, it still tends to glitch out especially when playing a game involving more than two Superstars, the Royal Rumble mode is near unplayable especially when the ring is filling up. DLC wise I think they have done the best they could, the NXT addition was a nice improvement to the game, many people wanted Shinsuke Nakamura added to the game and we finally got it. Overall I would give this game a 7 out of 10, the argument could be made that it's better and more enjoyable than WWE 2K16 and the new features would to some people merit spending the money to upgrade to the new version, however I still believe that it is nowhere near as good as the old SmackDown vs Raw games used to be. Overall improvements have been made but there is still a very long way to go to call this the best wrestling game ever made, it's in the top 10 but it's probably not in the top 5.			"

												Great wrestling game! I think it's a big improvement over 2k16' for many reasons.+Better graphics +Slightly more realistic player models(even though some still look off)+Very simple menu +Nice roster(I'm sure we'll get more dlc characters in the future, hopefully)+My favorite part is the creation options for custom characters. There are a plethora of different attires to choose from. Of course the game has its flaws here and there, but overall I enjoy it, as it gives more life than previous WWE games. I'd recommend it if you are a fan of these games. Many others seem to be having slowdown while playing with 4 or more characters in match.Personally I found that adjusting the crowd density to something like 30% makes a HUGE differencein the fps. I found this out while playing 2k16 and the same setting worked for this game too.			"

												Overall. Best WWE game out there.There are very few bugs on day 1; which is a nice surprise.  All I've noticed is a pay-per-view sound-effect looping in arena-cinematics, in MyCareer-mode. But this is too specific to stop me from playing.The game let's you create *basically* any wrestler imagineable. Including Super-Saiyan hair.The AI has been updated for 2k16, and the MyCareer-mode have been improved; all the most demanded changes from the last game. Rivalires are better and doesn't last as long; if you want. If anything, it's a bit harder to climb the ranks this time around. Which is cool for me, as I had hit all championships by year 2 in 2k16. Half way through yeah 1, and I'm not United States Champion yet.Fun, easy-to-pickup, great to look at and authenticically boring commentary; just like the real deal!			"

												Not only is this one of the best WWE games in years, but it quite possibly cracks the top 5 wrestling games for me. 2K17 improves upon the groundwork laid by the past two games, and finally feels like the next-generation wrestling game we were promised in 2014 with WWE 2k15. Game runs smoothly on the highest settings with an RX 480 and an i5 6600k, though your mileage may vary. One minor complaint is that cutscenes and entrances are locked at 30fps, but it's something that can be lived with. If you were a fan of the previous two installments in the series, then WWE 2K17 is a must purchase. If you aren't a fan of the game mechanics of the previous games, then turn away now. 2K17 refines the gameplay style that was started by 2K15, but doesn't re-invent the wheel in terms of gameplay.

												As of the time of this review, I have only played the game for about 4 hours. After playing WWE 2k16, I was super excited to hear that WWE 2K17 was coming to PC! Now if you have played WWE 2K16 I can tell you that a lot of the game is the same as that one. However, there are things added to this one that make it worth picking up.1. Backstage fighting! This is something that was missing from 2k16 that I was very happy to see back in 2k17. 2. Create your own entrance video! This is an awesome new addition to the game, and I love the fact that you can use the highlights from other matches in your video. The only thing they should add on to it is the ability to add in your own music.3. It's awesome to see Eddie back in action! Honestly I was really sad to hear of his passing when it happened in 2005, so to have him back in this game is awesome!4. Post match fighting! This is another cool add on, that you can now attack your opponent after the match!5. A change in the submission system. Tired of having to roll the right joystick around and around hoping your opponent will submit?! You can now change it to button combination....making it a bit easier to get out of a submission or get your opponent to tap.The only real negative I have with the game is the frame rate drops. For some reason, some of the entrances can be choppy at times, and then smooth the next time you play with the same wrestler. I'm not sure why this is, but I'm hoping a future update will iron this out. I also experienced it a second time when I was wrestling against more than one person. For example my tag match with my created wrestler and goldberg, vs Eddie and Brock with Steph as a manager. When I knocked Brock off the apron, the FPS dropped and really slowed down the game play as myself, Eddie, Brock, and Steph were all on screen at the same time.While the FPS issue is annoying, it really hasn't taken away from my enjoyment of the game. I'm just hoping they get rid of the issue in the future.Still, this game is worth the buy even with the FPS issues. Definitely is paced like an actual wrestling match.Whether you are a casual or hardcore wrestling fan this game is worth buying.			"

Graphics are killer, the campaign modes are cool, the chicks are super sexy for being a bunch of polygons. BUT, there is like no tutoria. That's rubbish. You play with your made up character and get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you, and SOMETIMES they'll tell you later like ""Oh dude, you shouldn't of done that, you shoulda done this"" I ended up button mashing on a damn WRESTLING game till I found out... some of the controls.

												I was really looking forward to this years game. With all the the new wrestlers to choose from and ""improvements"" over last years game I thought I would be playing this for ages. After playing career and universe mode  I can honestly say this is the worst wwe game in years. The career mode is plain awful. Just a grind with barely any story or real feuds to keep you interested. I've fought Mojo F'ing Rawley about 15 times. The promo's are a great idea but really badly implemented. Just sheer guess work. It's like the mode was made by a guy who's never seen wrestling but been given a book a about it. Rankings should not be a thing, title shots should be based on the quality of your matches. Kinda like the real product. I'm still not out of NXT so if the career mode suddenly gets better please correct me.The sad thing is the core game is quite fun and the roster is huge, there just isn't anything to keep you engaged. In the future I'll wait for a sale to buy as there's not enough content to justify the asking price.			"

												I was a big fan of Wrestling in the WWE Attitude era and enjoyed games like THQs WCW vs NWO and what not.  It had been years since I watched wrestling and didn't have a recent Wrestling game in my game library.  Being a big fan of NBA2k17, I figured what the hell, and purchased the game.I spent quite some time trying to get the game to not be locked at 60fps.  I run a GTX 1080 on a 144hz GSync monitor and couldn't get the game to break 60fps.  Tried tweaks in both the game and profile settings in Nvidia Control Panel to no avail.I thought the Create a Wrestler feature was in depth and let you make something pretty close to what you imagined...you can really spend alot of time in this mode and it's excellent...but....the gameplay...It's just sooo bad.  The controls seem unresponsive (to the point where I'm still having trouble doing basic moves which should be extremely easy to pull off.  Compared to the older wrestling games it's just not fun.  Matches seem slow paced and I just don't like the mechanics AT ALLI can't say I recommend this game due to it's bad gameplay.  The Roster and Create a Wrestler are the few bright spots of this game.			"

												-WWE 2k16 improved and fixed.-Full 21:9 ultrawide support unlike 2k16. Some menus and loading screens are 16:9 but even entrances are 21:9 which is great.- Major con : Many classic WWE superstars can't be unlocked unless you buy a dlc. But the roster in the game is big enough that I think it's fine, but I won't be paying for the dlcs. The game has Bret Hart, Macho Man, Earthquake, Ultimate warrior, Ted Dibiase, Vader, Diesel, Scot Hall, Andre and so many other classic wresters too but a few that are missing are : Hulk Hogan, Kurt Angle, and another major newtimer : Batista. While Batista can be downloaded from Custom Creations, some of the others are blocked behind dlcs which is a shame.-Triple Threat match type greatly improved by having a ""rollout system"" whereby the injured guy rolls out of the ring, and if needed, can get back in when he's up, at a cost, or stay outside longer so he'll receieve a buff. This makes the matches more interesting and more real WWE like (well WWE isn't exactly real, but you know what I mean.)-Steel Cage match vs AI is still boring and broken when playing Coop vs AI when we can let one enemy AI to get out and we can 2v1 the other guy until he's flat and we both can exit the cage simultaneously.-Crowd looks more packed and somewhat believable and less cringeworthy than 2k16. -Be warned though, there is no Hall of Fame like game mode like 2k16 where you got to play as Stone Cold and got to relive his real matches with cinematic real life footage. But there is a Wrestler creation section of course and that has a story mode. Basically this is a big drawback for those interested in playing more story related content.-There is a WWE Universe mode, which I don't know if it was present in previous WWEs, but here you get to make custom alliances, rivalries and even have run in interferences during / before / after matches, which adds to more wwe realism. You can simulate or play the matches that you like and this is sort of like a never ending story mode. There are promos to make any wrestler a Face or Heel too.-Heard online multiplayer has flaws, but I haven't tried it nor want to play it online. Great for couch coop with friends. Also other reviews here say the game crashes a lot, but hasn't occured to me even once yet maybe because my pc is good. i7 4790k @4 ghz, 16gb ram and gtx 970.-Overall, if you own 2k16 this doesn't change too much, with less story related content, but packs a bunch of improvements and extra features in the details that 2k16 lacks. So for those looking for local coop, this should be great, especially if you own an ultrawide monitor.			"

												Random crashes, abysmal controller sensitivity, shoddy framerates and some really weird graphical glitches. Oh, and if you have a racing wheel / pedal set hooked up to your system, the game simply goes haywire!Getting a refund. Hope 2K fixes this. Not worth your money or time right now.			"

												I recommend the game, it's a lot of fun.I'd wait for now though. It's running fine for me, but a lot of people seem to have issues with lag, crashing and save data loss.My main issue is they got rid of all the silly body sliders.			"

												Pro's- Better character creation and entrance creation.- Better graphics.- Very smoth animation on the new moves and all the old ones except for submission moves.- Very well optimized.- The gameplay experience is improved from the last games.Con's- Old submission moves looks a lot worse; face going through arms on the rear naked choke, etc.- horrible multiplayer servers and multiplayer bugs.This might be an biased conclusion, but I think the game is good, furthermore the multiplayer is abhorrible, and I don't think the game in it current state is worth the pricetag. If you like fighting games, buy it on sale!			"

Pros Largest roster of any WWE game ever Massive creation suite Improved MyCareer mode Backstage Brawls Fight in the crowd Improved gameplay Community Creations Renee Young actually looks like a humanCons Not very well-optimized. Make sure your computer can handle it Didn't include all DLCs like 2K15 and 2K16 did AI acts weird sometimes Glitches (some are annoying, others are just hilarious)Overall, great improvement over the last two games and very fun to play (or you can do what I do and set up AI vs AI matches to predict PPVs) "

Still got the win after various signatures, finishers and reversals.)The bad:CPU.Kicks.Out.Everytime.(With finisher sliders maxed outThere are people who are having issues with crashes, performance issues and FPS drops, so buy under your own risk.(I had 2-3 crashes during the first 2 days and since then I haven't had any..

												I can't comapre it to WWE games between WWE ' 13 - WWE '15 because I haven't played them before, however, I own 2K16. While in 2K17 the Ai is better (except for Tag Team) and the CAW system is 4 steps forward 2 steps backwards (typical of Yukes), the main issue I have with this game is it CRASHES WAY TOO MUCH!!! Even months after the PC release date, it crashes during loading and save sequences which puts me on edge because i'm worryed about losing my CAWS more than anything. Not to mention the sound glitches after the matches on Universe mode. I originally thought because I modded a few soundtracks into the game UNTIL it happened with one of the default soundtracks already in the game. When it works, I have a lot of fun with the game, but the ocassional glitches and freezing puts me on edge. On terms of functionality, 2K16 is MUCH better as i had little issues with the game overall. Would I reccomend this game? if you are a fan of the old Golden Age - Attitude Era wrestling, then stick with 2K16. If you are a Pro-Wrestling fan and/or WWE fan, then buy it.			"

												There's this really weird glitch in the game were I can beat Roman Reigns clean.Ok on a serious note. If you're crazy like me and you only like to create tons of characters and only play as them then I recommend getting this game. The character creator in is really damn good. Its one of the best character creators I've seen. 80% of my playtime on this game has just been my making tons of cool characters and waifus.The only problems had with the game so far is that your male characters and female characters can't fight each other. You can use a data editor to make your female characters count as male characters however I wouldn't recommand that because it glitches out their character models and the textures.Another thing that game does hard crash a lot. Which does get really annoying at times and the commentary during matches is pretty cringy and imritating.			"

												The fact I spent more than 20 bucks on this game is kind of a travesty. It crashes all the time, it's buggy, the whole highlight reel feature is terrible quality, and I've never used it, but it sounds like online mode is terrible... but if I said I didn't have any fun with this game, I'd be lying.Character customization is great even though it takes longer than erosion, Universe mode is probably pretty underwhelming for most people but I really like it cause I'm a dweeb, My Career feels like a grind sometime, but of coures I still love it. If you're a fan of wrestling games, wait til' it's cheaper then buy it. It can be really entertaining goofing around with your friend on local play using hideous CAWs.			"

												Pretty decent game. Gameplay is about the same as '16 but adds more you can do. However the game is incredibly buggy. Its nice to have for an updated roster and all, but if you want a game thats not gonna drive you nuts with audio and other mechanical issues I'd just stick to 2k16. However the game is enjoyable when not bugging out.			"

												Preface: I recommend the game only, because steam doesn't allow me to leave an indifferent review.Pros: Backstage Brawl has returned,         The pacing and damage have been changed to make the game flow better          Stack Tables          Expanded creation suite allows you to create any wrestler you can imagine.Cons: The game constantly crashes; whether you're halfway through a 30 minute iron man match or an hour into editing a CAW, the game will inexplicably crash at least once every few hours.           A.I. still gangs up on the player during triple threat matches. The A.I. rarely attack eachother unless the player  leaves the ring for an extended period.           No new titles / no brand split           The game crashes ALOT           The game rarely maintains a consistent frame rate and is extremly jarring at times.           The game doesn't show any mercy and crashes when it's the most inconvenient.TLDR: The game has made some strides to a more realistic feel and the creation suite expansion allows you to create any wrestler you can imagine. However the frequent crashes that seem to happen at the most incovenient times suck nearly all the fun from the game.Dear 2K: Fix your game			"

												Big improvement from 2k16. Biggest issues are the crashes that occasionally occur on some of the customization screens such as moveset and appearance. Additionally I encounter drops in framerate during entrances and matches with 4+ competitors. Outside of those technical issues however, this is a very solid wrestling game, loads of customization, from characters to match options. The my career is much improved, albeit the promo system can take a good long while to understand, and moving up the ranks is a grind of the RPG kind (ALL ABOUT THE POPULARITY). If you're a fan of the wrestling game genre pick this one up.			"

												I have zero issue with paying for the DLC, but what I do have issue with is paying for the DLC when it is coming out later than other platforms and the content files are literally already on my computer ready to be played but merely waiting for an arbitrary activation. I enjoy these games, but if you want to put PC on the back burner for another year then you probably should have kept the old model of just doling out the DLC with the core product.			"

												Is this game a good game? Well kind of, but it falls short in many small ways but it hits the big notes pretty well. On certain in game models this game looks amazing, some wrestlers *cough* Dana Brooke *cough* it's absolutely terrifying. The charcter creation is back in a big way especially compared to how 2K started their tenure with this series, plenty of options to choose from even borrowing gear from real life WWE talent that you can fully customize. You can get lost for hours just making one CAW, so that alone is worth the price of admission for a life long wrestling game fan like me. And that's not to say that the other creation modes are bad, because most of them are pretty good. Arena is amazing, giving you plenty of options to make a unique arena that you can use in Universe Mode. Creating titles is pretty fun, if at times a little annoying because some logos don't fit. The biggest dissapointments as far as the creation system goes is create a video and creat a victory. Create a Victory should really be called choose which WWE star you are going to copy when you win. Create a video is good so long as you are only making entrance videos, don't think about using the other scenes. Making a video using in ring actions, like Staredowns or Brawls, is a war of attrition and actions of faith. What may look good in the preview, will come out like steam pressed poop after encoding. Universe Mode is still better than Career Mode for those of you wanting to make your creation the baddest superstar, EVAH. Career Mode is better, but it still takes forever to even get a title shot. The promo engine is a step in the right direction, but it desperately needs VO (please just grab some indy guys and let them do some VO work for next years edition.) And yeah the Heyman challenge and the Authority stuff is kinda cool, but not for long and it becomes more of a chore than a pleasure later in the game. Overall would I recommend this game, if you are a wrestling fan yes. Liking this game is akin to being a wrestling fan in real life, you know it's bad but you can't help but fall in love with it's imperfections.			"

												The game is great, especially if you got a little into WWE Universe (by WWE2k16 for me). The MyCarreer is pretty damn awesome. Yes, it still holds the grind a little, but if you want to roll over opponnents, change to easy.Lots of Runs In (playing a FACE carreer and it's not boring at all), the injury factor, the Microphone for any reason you want, getting attention of the Authority with LOTS and LOTS of Cage Match, Hell in a Cell, No Holds Barred and so on (all of that and yet I'm still climbing the HeavyWeight), T-Shirts sales to help you with your VCs (and Authority challenges if you're HEEL with multipliers!), Heyman Guy with multiple bonuses (on the long run ofc), etc, etc, etc. Runs pretty smoothly with no crashs.For me, worth every penny.Well forget what I wrote, both save datas got corrupted form my carreer. 178 hours thrown into garbage, stay away from this crap.

												This game is a piece of trash.Crashes 24/7. Saves delete seemingly at random. Literally NOTHING IN THIS GAME WORKS. I spent nearly 50 hours making custom characters for a custom universe show, painstakingly having to reboot this buggy nightmare ""game"" only to have all 40+ characters be deleted, as well as hundreds of custom logos, and all progress in my Universe mode.I'm done. This game is broken. I will never buy a 2k WWE game ever again. How a company can screw up and release a product this bad I can't even fathom. Some exec at 2k literally had to sit down and say, ""Yep, this broken, unplayable, buggy, defunct piece of trash, is the game we want to release.""And before anyone brings up my system, i'm running a Core i5, GeForce 970, and 8gb or RAM, so I should have no issues running this peice of complete garbage. I reccommend spending your time and money on a game that doesn't suck.			"

												Great game to play when you have spare time or if your a WWE fan like myself, Dont really have much else to say, everything works and plays as it should with no bugs that i can report.How ever one thing i can say is the game is extremely repetitive by that i mean you will face the same superstar many....MANY times match after match with no end gains, moving up the ranks seems random and very long winded for instance it took me 21 hours of real time game play just to gain the US title from Dean Ambrose!Proceed as you wish, like i said its a great game to play just VERY drawn out imo.
