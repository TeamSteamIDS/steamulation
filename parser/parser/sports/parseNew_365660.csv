												Its like Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Skate and Super Meat Boy had a threesome, its amazing.Took me a while to get use to the controls, and I'm still messing up every so often, but once you get use to it, it feels pretty damn good. Pulling off huge combos is very satisfyingSound effects, visuals and music are great. Although I think I'll throw in some super meat boy hell dark world to really get the blood flowing.			"

												i have played olliolli 2 before on the ps4. so i know what i am getting. but so happy its on WIN/MAC/LINUX.handles great, tight controls and the gameplay is stepped up a notch because manuals/reverts are in. so combos are huge.the soundtrack is brilliant. great and well chosen music, perfect for olliolli.a perfectly balanced game, that really does make you wonder if your gamepad will last the night from retry after retry to get the highest scoresone thing i can say on a bad note is that the optimisation seems to be a bit slow. unlike olliolli 1 which was stupidly fast, there seems be some slow down here. it may be because of the port [because it feels like one, if not fair enough]. but i will leave that up to updates in future and hope it gets addressed.all in all, a great product, sequel and tons of fun. well worth it. you should buy itrating: solid-*UPDATED ADDITION REGARDING SLOW DOWN*-i did actually turn down the resolution in video settings, and that has really made a difference to what it should be like. so maybe try that if slow down is a problem******			"

												Awesome skateboarding game that is a nice challenge, has good controls and will keep you laughing. I was a big fan of the SKATE series and this is pretty much a 2d/indie version of SKATE. If you want gameplay that is a nice challenge, enjoy skateboarding or just want an overall fun game give this one a try! You will be doing all kinds of crazy tricks for hours on end. The maps are very well designed levels and the game is quite addicting!This game will keep you coming back for more and more trying to beat hard levels and trying to improve scores. The game also has been running well to, no crashes, no fps issues, no gamebreaking bugs,etc.. Olli! Olli! Olli! Olli!			"

												First thing first, I loooved the first OlliOlli, so no need to say that I had high expectations for this one.Well I havent been disapointed at all. Roll7 managed to improve a game that was already brillant.Gameplay is tight, and quite punishing (especially on RAD mode), but incredibly rewarding once you master it :)Easy to handle, hard to master (MASTER). Add some nice graphics and great soundtrack on top of that, and you'll have a must-play game that I would recommend with no hesitations.And yeah, I beat that **** RAD mode :D !!!Well done Roll7 !

												As a fan of the first game I like OlliOlli 2: We Had Funds For An Actual Artist This Time Edition just the same. The team managed to keep the great controls and add some new stuff like manuals and perfect launchers, minor changes for some but I'll take it in the year when Activision finally killed Tony Hawk's franchise with a complete turd.Kinda wish the game had a controller vibration toggle and didn't promote the xbone controller that much though (there are no bindings for the standard 360, Microsoft promotional funds perhaps?) .

												What the first OlliOlli game did well in, this sequel made better. While it's possible to play on keyboard, you may find yourself in a better position with a controller, as pulling off tricks with the analog feels easy to do when you first play it. There are also new tricks to do to further your scoring potentail that wasn't there in first game: Manuals, Reverts and Switch-Grinding. This means you can score even harder than you imagined compared to the first game.In the same fashion of the first game, there are levels with challenges for you to clear to unlock Pro mode, which is the harder variation of that stages. Clearing Pro mode will unlock RAD mode, which is skating flawlessly or eat dirt for not nailing everything perfectly. Safe to say it's not for the faint of heart or those who never experence having sore thumbs for gaming hard.For those that look to boast their scoring abilites after handling what the game has to offer, look no further to Spot challenges and the Daily Grind that has online leaderboards. You can also play locally with up to 4 buds in a split-screen Combo rush mode, which is a nice plus to what the game already has. OlliOlli2 is a good step up from the original, worth looking into if you're interested.			"

												The gameplay has been vastly improved upon the original OlliOlli, it's more responsive and the addition of manual and reverts makes the game deeper, more challenging, and more fun. The graphics have also been improved quite a lot.A new multiplayer mode is cool, although it is only splitscreen 4-way (even if you're just 2 players) on your monitor, an online multi would have been awesome.The soundtrack is still great, but it might be the only point where the first one was better. There are still some fantastic songs on this one, but a couple of them are a bit forgettable, and I'm missing a couple of the best ones from the original. Gonna look into a way to ""mod"" them into this version if possible.For newcomers, be warned, this game is HARD. It can be really frustrating if you don't get a hang of it, some of my friends that tried it on my pc couldn't figure the game at all (granted they didn't play more than half an hour), but I love that it's challenging, it reminds me of the old Skate or Die/Ski or Die games, and when you're half decent at it, it's a lot of fun!10/10, will get carpal tunnel syndrome again.

												Unbelievable how much they improved on the original: OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood (yeah seriously) offers tighter controls, a more refined artstyle, a more complete combo system and a better soundtrack. What remained more or less the same is the no-nonsense difficulty of the first, so if you can stomach monstrous amounts of trial and error (looking at the robot levels), there's no reason why you shouldn't fall in love with this game.

												Pros:+ Great, responsive controls+Lots of content+Looks great+Few glitches (other than some clipping with death animations that are mentioned below)+Very difficult, yet rewarding enough to keep you going+Very addictive+ Has free-play mode for all levelsCons:- $17 might be a little bit much to ask for a 2d side-scrolling game, but value isn't really a concern if you end up liking the game and pumping hours upon hours into it (like I am likely to do)- Death animations are hilarious the first few times but are ultimately on the glitchy side with some clipping, and obvious disregard of physics, although intentional, I would've prefered somehting a little less over-the-top- Menu controls on the controller are more than a little finicky- No 21:9 support (although, it doesn't crop like some games, it just adds black bars on the side, but it would've been really useful in a side-scroller like this to have that kind of support, enven if my high scores didn't count)Bottom Line:As someone who was a huge fanboy for the Skate series on Playstation, and a huge advocate for sports games, seeing another skateboarding game on PC is refreshing, even if it's quite a lot different looking than Skate. But removing that third dimension, they still managed to keep the element of difficulty in this game while keeping it very simple.This is a simply addictive skateboard game that is a must-buy for anyone who liked Super Hexagon, Skate, or the Tony Hawk games, and I would still recomend it to anyone else who is looking for a simple game that's easy to learn and run, but addictive and difficult enough to keep you angrily fascinated enough to keep playing.

												OlliOlli2 is a very fast-paced, skateboarding platformer game with similarities to games from the Tony Hawk series and Skate series. It is relatively easy but hard to master, and there is plenty of content, giving it lots of replay value. I have only invested an hour and a half into this game, however, I can see myself playing it much more in the future.Oh, and the soundtrack is great too.			"

												Skateboarding and videogames go together like peanut butter and jelly.  Just like the Tony Hawk and Skate games left their mark on the industry so too did OlliOlli.  Although the sequel may not be revolutionary it does are great job of capitalizing on what made the first game great while simultaneously improving itself in almost every aspect.  New stages, tricks, and challenges will make this second installment a worthwhile play for those who have already finished the first game.  If you're new to the series don't worry, excellent tutorials will catch you up to speed real fast.OlliOlli is a fast-paced, side-scrolling, skateboarding extravaganza.  Those who played Skate will feel right as home as this games main tool for tricks is the analog stick.  By flicking the analog stick you can jump up in the air and perform various flip tricks.  You'll also need to hold down the analog stick right before hitting a rail to grind.  To land any other tricks you'll need to tap the A (or X) button right before landing.  As you proceed father into the game you'll need to be able to quickly transition back and forth between rails and the surface in mere seconds.  Its a thrilling experience that requires you to find the right rhythm to flow smoothly through each stage.The atmosphere in OlliOlli 2 is incredible and the art is gorgeous.  The game has a very slick, colorful, presentation..  Although it clearly resembles the original, this time around the art is much cleaner and a lot less pixalated.  Each location offers a unique theme from the jungle, to the old west, the carnival, and beyond.  The highlight however is the soundtrack.  A wonderful selection of pulsing electronic music is bound to put you in a trance as you play.  The best part about the music in this game is that it keeps playing continuously, even as you reset a stage or open up various menus.The most notable change to this sequel is the new tricks, specifically manuals.  Just like manuals revolutionized the second Tony Hawk game so too do they this game.  The ability to manual coincidentally lets you combo your tricks trough the entirety of each level.  This is especially import for the Spot mode which only let you perform one combo per stage.  Manuals are pretty easy to do so if you really want to achieve a high-school you'll need to combine them with two of the other new tricks, grind-switches and reverts.  Grind-switches let you mix things up on long grinds while reverts let you switch your stance as you land a trick.This is clearly an enjoyable title in many ways.  The gameplay is very smooth and rewarding while the soundtrack is exciting and motivating.  That all being said this really isn't that drastically different from the first game.  If you played the original OlliOlli you can pretty much expect more of what that game offered.  The new stages and tricks, along with a magnificent new soundtrack, add quite a bit of value and incentive for picking up this game.  Whether you played the first one or not it, definitely check this one out.  OlliOlli offers a thrilling experience for gamers and skaters alike.			"

												This game is pretty fun, kinda. I would only recommend it if you're a masochist like me.I don't have a controller so haven't tested that, but I've logged a ton of time trying to perfect tricks like the manual on a keyboard.I'm thinking keyboard control is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing punishing or just plain buggy. I'm leaning towards the later because it seems I can land perfect manuals consistently on some parts, and on another part (that's pretty much the same as the others), I haven't been able to land a single manual to save my life.It's damn frustrating (and not in a Meatboy kind of way).

												I know i haven't played this game very much yet, mainly because i did not have a controller before and playing this game with a keyboard is quite difficult.Also it takes more time to get used to all the buttons required to do tricks, land them, grind etc. So, today i bought a controller, which isn't anything fancy (pricetag was about 15€ = 18$), and it works just fine with OlliOlli2.Also i beat my first level highscore on second try, which took like 20 tries on keyboard...yeah, playing this game with a controller is that much easier and you get used to controls much faster and in comparison i have very little experience playing with controllers.So if you get this game, get a controller also because you will have hard time trying to learn how to play this game properly with a keyboard.The controller which i bought is Giotek VX-1 (works on PC/PS3) and i can play this game just fine with it, only problem that this controller has, is that X,Y,A,B have been replaced with some weird♥♥♥♥♥dots, but i got used to those buttons quite quickly.Pros: - Good, in-depth tutorial- Multiple levels and gamemodes- Dozens of different tricks and over a dozen of different grind styles- Leaderboards, if you want to compete with other players- Nice, fitting in-game musicCons:- Hard to play with keyboard, get a controller instead, as i explained up there.- Can make you ragequit if you play with a keyboard.Not pro or con:- This game is quite unforgiving, one example is that if you jump over a staircase and you fail the landing, you fall and you have to restart the level. Although this teaches you how to play.-------------------------------------------------------Please, get a controller, just for your own sake.			"

Full level combos now possible thanks to new mechanic: manuals, perfect landings are not that strict and frustrating anymore, fun achievements and level goals, great new tricks like double flips, 720 flips and kickflip underflip.

 Even better than first one! OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood is a hard as hell sidescroll arcade skate game, which is probably the best ""skate"" game you can get on Steam. I'm a huge fan of the first one aswell, but in my opinion the developers managed to make a great game even better.Here's why: The positive :+  An outstanding soundtrack. The first one had a great soundtrack, too and OlliOlli2 doesn't disappoint in the slightest with it's choice of music. It's a mixture of electronica, glitch & and hiphop (artists like CidRim or Kyle Cook) and does just fit so well to game. One of the reasons I like that game so much!+  Optimized Gameplay. What makes OlliOlli2 such a great successor is the fact that they added plenty of new mechanics which make the game for one part more difficult but also way more entertaining. Now it is possible to get even bigger combos due to the new manuals and reverts. Also they added a bunch of new tricks (Double Treflip, Darkslide and others) and you're now allowed to change your trick while grinding (f.e. from Nosegrind to Crailslide). This makes the gameplay just so much more fun, as you have way more options to finish a level. The tricks are done similar to the game Skate by using the leftstick to perform different moves.+  Fixed the old problems. Another positive aspect is the overall more polished presentation and more responsive controls. While still retaining the retro look they also managed to make game look better overall. Also in the first part it sometimes felt like some controls weren't executed by the game (resulting in starting all over). Roll7 did a good job in fixing some minor issues.Plus, the new levels look pretty great and have (especially in the later pro levels) a really nice level design. I sometimes had problems distinguishing some objects and obstacles in the first one, now everything is quite good to see.+  Lots of content for a reasonable price. The game isn't that expensive and for a really nice price you get a lot of content. You basically have 5 levels per world and 5 challenges per level. It takes a while to beat everything (took me around 8 hours for the amateur challenges), also you have lots of achievements and a nice feature called daily grind where you can play a level and compare you points on a worldwide leaderboard. Oh, and there is an extra ""spot"" per level you have to skate in one combo, which also will be visible on a leaderboard. The neutral : ~  Could've added more new gameplay features I generelly like everything they added but I feel like they easily could add even more, f.e. Grabs, real Lateflips (can only be done with a trick combo f.e. Hardflip-LateShuvIt) and Flatlandtricks while manualing. I guess they keep that for another sequel.~  Hard as hell! I generelly don't see it as really flaw (I actually like it, you have quite a high skill ceiling) but it should be mentioned that it is a really difficult game and for some people maybe a lil bit too difficult. The negative :-  Some minor flaws I'm having a hard time finding anything bad, but there are some minor flaws I should mention. For example the game occasionally freezes for 2-3 seconds, which is absolutely deadly for such a fast paced game. This doesn't happen often, but it is still annoying. Also it would be awesome to see the different runs for highscores, which they sadly didn't add. (Maybe also a future thing).And why aren't there any steam trading cards? Overall impression :I absolutely recommend this game if you're into arcade and/or sidescrolling games! It's basically a mixture of games like SuperMeatBoy and Skate. The second part does everything the first did and even more and better, also it isn't that expensive even when it isn't on sale!So, go get it! Get's a smooth 88/100! "

												Olliolli is basically the best retro arcade skating game, with it's sequel Olliolli 2: welcome to olliwood the gameplay becomes richer! The new hand-drawn style allows more diversified maps with now curves and air spots, and it is GREAT, the maps are really interesting, with great opportunities for the score grinders and still accessible for the chillax players.Environements are original and beautifully achieved.New moves! for the fans of the first game, be ready to punish your controller!! manuals and other moves related to grinds are in and they are essential in making a huge score!Sounds and musics are well done and pretty smooth, Grind of the day is still there, 4 players split screen local multiplayer is on!(I will edit it it a few hours when we try it)Skate believers, arcade grinders, get your hands on this!

												I loved the first OlliOlli. Tight controls, no lag, and fantastic flow. OlliOlli 2 is lacking these elements.I got pretty good at the first one, but in this sequel I'm having major difficulty landing tricks, doing combos and executing grinds. It's just not responsive. Some times it's so bad that I try to do a 3-key combo, 2 of the keys execute, I don't succesfully land, and then the 3rd key I pushed starts executing the next trick.Grinds in the first game were super fun to do. You'd practically magnetize to rails as long as you were above them. Now you have to be accurate like landing a trick normally. I'd normally be okay with increasing the difficulty, but this just ruins the flow of gameplay.Also, this game sadly falls into the ever-expanding category of ""games with Retro-Like Graphics that take a ton of system resources to run"".In conclusion: I'm so disappointed.

												I never played the first game and only picked this up on a whim during a summer sale.I thought this would be a great party game to play local co-op however due to the numerous issues I've had with controller detection, button latency, and incorrect button registration, it's practically unplayable. In addition, the game will often lag for me during the music transitions which can ruin otherwise excellent runs. I really can't understand the transition lag as I'm running this on an i7-4790k and GTX 970.The controls feel rather un-intuitive which normally wouldn't be an issue except that you apparently can't remap the controls. What's most bizarre to me is the fact that something as simple as a rumble setting, which the game does have, is not within the game's menu's but requires you to add a -norumble line to the execution path. I'm guessing this game was made with very specific intentions when it comes to how it's played, thus the option to control any way you'd like is not available.Personally, I can't recommend this game at it's full price ($15 currently)			"

												It feels like most of my Steam reviews are just a paraphrasing of ""it's a great game, but it's not for me"", followed by the template ""the game's XYZ aspect is great, but here's a paragraph of a single mechanic that mostly ruined it for me"". And that's what OlliOlli2 is to me, sadly.This game has excellent great presentation and polish out the wazoo, and the mechanics to back it up. But man, I am not a fan of the controls, which involve flicking the stick in various motions and then letting go. It just never felt right to me, and I could never get into the ""flow"" I was looking for. That, and a lot of the objectives in the game involve going for score, which invariably means you have to be really dextrous and masterful in nailing lots of tricks and grinds in quick succession. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but I don't feel like investing the time in getting good if I find that the core mechanic of using the thumbstick clumsy and un-fun.And for what it's worth, I've played my fair share of board-based games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Skate 3, and tolerated the trick/style aspect of those games because they felt good enough for me not to care too much. I can't say the same for OlliOlli2, as good of a game as it is.			"

			Genna plays OlliOlli 2. A Skating game where you combo tricks together in differently themed maps. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...		

The controls are very tight, and it's simple enough to perform different tricks. Although, it takes a bit more effort to string all of them together in a long combo. However, when you get good at the game and manage to do the entire level in one long combo, the game is incredibly satisfying. Stuff like that feels very rewarding.The trick system is actually decently complex with the amount of stuff you can do.There's a wide variety of different levels, each containing cool new props and sights to see, which keeps the game fresh.The game also has a lot of fun modes, including splitscreen tournaments, and daily challenges where you have once chance to get as many points as possible in a unique map created just for that day.Overall, if you're into skating in any way, give the game a try!

Although it may be tough at first to get a grip on the controls, getting use to timing ur landings etc ,once you get the hang of it you won't stop nailing combos.

												Overall the game is fun, soundtrack is good and look OK for the type of game. There are however glitches here an there and the controls feel somewhat off with my non-xbox controller (could be my controller, could be the game). It's still unclear to me when exactly to “plant” a trick, the momentum feels random most of the time. Also, try to ride down some small stairs without jumping/tricks and try to land, it's impossible to do this right/not-sloppy. Grinding is a big part of the game and especially when you just started playing the game it's unclear whether an object is grindable or not. So you don't know if your just missing the hotspot or you cannot grind it. This is very frustrating. I still like playing the game but in my opinion it's not worth the €14,- and I wish I would have waited a while longer for a discount or something. Cheers.			"

												Very good game mechanically, read other reviews for the pros. I'm just gonna list a major con:The FPS is locked at 60.The game itself mentions that it's super fast and you should set your TV/monitor to gaming mode. Then why did you lock the FPS to 60 you dumb f***s? The only use of 120 / 144 Hz monitors is for playing games like this - where stuff moves so fast it makes you vomit. If you're one of those ""human eye can't see above 60 FPS"" guys, then just go to this link[www.testufo.com] and tell me you don't see any ghosting / uncomfortable visuals at 60 FPS, especially if you increase the speed. Yeah, well now imagine the entire background is doing that. Or just go to youtube, look up a video of this game and go fullscreen. Instant vomit.			"

												It's a precision platformer where you go really fast. It has a Street Fighter-like combo system, but you rack up points instead of damage, and you're trying really hard to not hurt the little guy instead of beating someone up. It has the constant silly deaths of I Wanna Be The Guy, but with better art and less crashing.50 levels spread across 5 worlds and 2 tiers of difficulty, each level has 5 badges for meeting certain challenges on the level. One is always to get a certain score, one for getting a certain size combo, and three that make increasingly absurd demands on your dexterity and concentration. As I've gone from struggling to complete world 1 to being able to speed-run through half the game, I have kept running into challenges that make me say ""what? That's possible? How?"" -- and I am still hitting them!			"

I've twisted control sticks, clicked trigger buttons, and the dude just falls on his face again and again.Play ANYTHING else with a skateboard in it...hell, even Bart VS The Space Mutants had better skateboard controls than this piece of garbage.If they add a feature to remap the controls, I would LOVE to play this game again.

												This game had its ideas, had its originality, and had could be an awsome game.But guess what, this game is the laziest game I've played.Sure it was accepteble in 1990 but ffs its 2016 and we have had 20 years of making games and they still do this.the controls are terrible and unpleasing, and dont tell me that this is made for controlers because ♥♥♥♥ing hell this♥♥♥♥♥♥is on steam one of the biggest internet PC store, not for ♥♥♥♥ing xbox.I'm not bying a controler for a mother ♥♥♥♥ing game.And timing is the most important thing.Ok so now lets get into the biggest problem of this game, the controls.-If I am in mid air, and click/tap one of the jump trick keys lke ""adsw"" they delay it til i land, and then do the move. (which usally ends up killing me)-The manuals are terrible, if you dont succesfully do it you end up immobolized were you have to re tap the jump keys which is really fustrating.-the railing is very time based, and its really just a guessing game, since you dont know if you timed that jump perfectly or if you werent holding the key.So yea,  like i said. THIS GAME IS CREATED FOR MONEY AND NOT FOR ENJOYMENT.I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS!!!			"

												I just want to say ahead of this review I love the idea of the game, I love the graphics and the indie feel of it. I feel alot of love was put into the idea espcially after checking out the tricktionary and some of the features added into this.But the biggest complaint I have about this game is the controls, it's so frustratingly bad i couldn't stand more then 10 mins of this game.  I have put thousands of hours into games like Skate, Tony Hawk franchise, and even older the old snowboarder games like Cool Boarders on playstation.  I just feel like this games controls are way to frustrating and they defy common sense.  I think it would have been alot cooler to have it be close to the Tony hawk pro skater franchise in its control scheme, have one button that lets you push and pop the board and have other buttons to do those tricks and then use the analog stick to adjust the land.  Instead of this wonky♥♥♥♥♥shit where you have to press a button before your board hits the ground with one hand if your using keyboard and the other hand is getting used to doing the tricks.  Its just awkward the way they set it up.You can remap the controls sure, but that doesnt remap the way they have it set up, because they have push/land on one button so it doesn't actually change anything.I personally can't recommend this game until a mod comes out to change the control scheme, or the devs add in a way to change the control scheme and that's sad because I really love the idea of this game and I see it has massive potential as an indie game and as a skateboard game on the pc.

The controller support is excellent, and the fact that it supports linux natively means I can play this in my living room on my steambox when friends are over. Local co-op extends the game to allow many more hours of fun with friends even after you get tired of playing solo.I highly recommend this game.			"

												Take The Impossible Game and splice it with Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 and you'd have something like this. OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood features five different campaigns, each with five missions. Each mission has five challenges, which when completed, unlocks the Pro varient of that mission. Once all five chalenges in Pro mode are beaten across the entire game, Rad mode is unlocked. Obviously there are alot of unlockables and plenty of content to keep you wanting more. They even have split screen multiplayer for up to four players so you can share the excitement with friends. However, there are some things excluded from this title that seems kinda....off.1.) no skater customization: Granted he is a pixelated character with no voice and you barely spend anytime looking at him it would be nice to change his appearance or the look of the skateboard.2.) No map creator: It wouldn't be so bad if this game didn't scream for it. I could imagine downloading hundreds of fan-made maps that are fun and or difficult.Still earns a rating of 9/10 from me			"

												OlliOlli2 is an awesome arcade game,with simple basis but complex advanced techniques,so you can have a lot of fun  with any skill level,by trying to finish a level, or doing a level-long combo to reach the world record.Concretely, the game is a 2D skating game, I think you noticed it,but what the screenshots and the trailer don't show you,is that this game has a particular gameplay.You can enter tricks with the left stick, and do spins or special trickswith the triggers of your pad (pad game,  almost unplayable on keyboard).but you need, when landing your tricks, to press the A (or cross)  button before hitting the floor to validate your trick.(and also not slam your head on the asphalt)and this is a really particular gameplay mechanic,so you will need a little bit time to get used with it.bit by bit, you will try more advanced tricks,and pretty insane techniques to do a level-long combo,but you shall first humbly try to finish the levels without falling in deadly spikes or getting burned in lava! now, what people expect from a review:GRAPHICS: cool, a little bit generic and not really varied,but you won't really focus on it.MUSIC: very cool, gets you really in the mood of skating,some music have a rythm that can very close to the game rythm,leading to moments where your actions are synced with the music,just by chance. also, no dubsteb. so really cool.LIFETIME: pretty much time, from 10 hours if you want to go straight, to 35-50 hours if you want to 100% the game.(I played OlliOlli 1, so started with an advantage)BONUS: MULTIPLAYER.the game has a local splt-screen multiplayer, which is really great,but as you need minimum 1 hour of practice before not slammingyour face on the road every 2 meters, it's not a game i would playwith my friends,  it's sadly not immediatly fun.(but really fun with a minuimum of practice!)TO OLLIOLLI 1 OWNERS:More graphics, more music, more tricks, more difficulty.buy it.LINUX: the game's available on Linux. pretty cool.so if you are a linux user, first, I respect you,secondly, buy this game.(if you didn't played Portal 1/2, Super Meat Boy and  VVVVV, though)TL;DR:read the first five lines of my review, and  buy the game.11/10 would beat world records in RAD mode again.Come on, buy the game, I need people playing this game,I have world records on almost every levels, I need new challengers!

When you first start and see the goals per level it is easy to think ""yeah right, I will never be able to do (insert task here)"", but keep at it.   Easily the most addictive game I've played in quite some time.   I would reccomend using a controller instead of the keyboard if you have one available.  If you are not aware, it is possible to use your PS3/PS4/XBOX controllers on your PC.   Try googling ""SCP PS3 Drivers"" for more info.			"

												In many ways, I prefer the viscosity of the original's flow.  The feel of the controls and the overal visual design are totally different this time around.  The gameplay is more fluid, but it also feels less challenging.  The new sets are well done, and provide a completely different experience, but in the process, everything becomes a bit outlandish and can feel a little force.  Overall, the sequel improves on every technical aspect of the game, yet fails to foster the suspension of disbelief and authenticity that the grounded design of the first one captivated me with.A solid game and a totally different experience.  Both titles are excellent and complimentary.  If you are new to the series, I would start with the first one.			"

I am amazed at the gameplay, the music, the challenge, the speed, the fluidity, the control scheme, and also how the music blends in with the game itself, which is different from the music itself. I cannot believe how big of an upgrade this is from the original.			"

												Really great sidescrolling skate game. Sorta combines Unirally and Tony Hawks Pro Skater if you're old enough to remember either of those.The controls are tricky, but they allow for some really complex combos and tricks.The levels look great, and encourage exploration as well as gnarly combinations and perfect landings.I'm yet to try to multiplayer, but so far it's been a lot of fun.

												Fun, hard, frustrating and rewarding. If you want a challenge and you love pulling out really long and difficult combos that will award you with millions of points (or fail right at the end of the combo and get nothing) this game is for you. I'm having tons of fun with this and it has lots of tricks (more than I imagined a 2d skating game would have before playing it).			"

												A fun little fast-paced game thats good to put on for about half an hour when you can't think of anything else to play.  Another game with one of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' styles of difficulty. The controls are simple enough but mastering levels requires you to use them perfectly. An all around fun game.

												In many ways, I prefer the viscosity of the original's flow.  The feel of the controls and the overal visual design are totally different this time around.  The gameplay is more fluid, but it also feels less challenging.  The new sets are well done, and provide a completely different experience, but in the process, everything becomes a bit outlandish and can feel a little force.  Overall, the sequel improves on every technical aspect of the game, yet fails to foster the suspension of disbelief and authenticity that the grounded design of the first one captivated me with.A solid game and a totally different experience.  Both titles are excellent and complimentary.  If you are new to the series, I would start with the first one.			"

												This game could be called ""Pirate our music from youtube"" and it'd be entirely accurate. The sound track to this game is superb. The gameplay is just as great as the first but it's been enhanced without taking anything away. A worthy successor to the first, and worth every dollar if this is your first OlliOlli game.I rate this game as worth: $15The game is pure quality, but it's a very bite-size type of game with limited content.Why you must buy:+Astounding sound+Tight controls and rewarding gameplay.Words of caution:-Can be difficult/learning curve-Neighbors complain of loud music			"

												I wrote reviews in Englesh for study. Japanese one is below.-----Now I've finished Amateur level.OlliOlli2 is a kind of running game but we have fun to play with many tricks linked by combos. It is easy to just finish whole courses, however, for high score, we must repeat trial and error to master tricks and courses. BGMs are so great, easy to listen, and graphics are beautiful. The player character is well-designed and easy to handle (""ASDW"" and arrow keys only). I'm glad Retry is one button('R'). Includes 25 courses, but in Pro level (obstacles are arranged difficultly) up to 50 courses. Moreover, there are 250 challenges to achive, great. I have not played yet however there is RAD mode which is the most difficult to accomplish. I'm afraid it might be impossible to complete achivements... Also it includes Spot mode (score attack?), Daily grind (have chance once only) and Local multiplayer mode. I fully enjoyed to play but there are a bit points to improve. First, the transition of menu is a little troublesome. Second, I want Stage editting and Share mode. Finally, there are some typos in Japanese, so that it is impossible to complete challenge. For example, amateur challenge of 5-5, ""すべてのグラインド、マニュアル、ローンチなどをパーフェクトに"" is wrong, ""Spinを30回以上決めてフィニッシュ"" is correct.OlliOlli2 is an excellent game. I recommend to buy this game with soundtrack on sale.一先ずプロ転向できたので感想を単純なランゲームだが、多彩なトリックをコンボで繋いでいく面白さがある。ステージを完走するだけなら簡単だが、高得点を狙うには技とコースを覚え、トライ＆エラーを繰り返す必要がある。BGMは軽快で心地よく、背景も色合いが美しい。キャラクタの動きも凝っていて操作感は良好である。キーボードのASDW及び上下左右のみで操作が可能で、またリトライもワンボタン（R）でやりやすい。コース数は5×5で25本だが、障害物の配置が異なるプロと合わせて実質50本。また各コースに5つのチャレンジがあるので一つのコースを何度も楽し（苦し）める。まだ自分は出来ていないが高難易度のRADモードなるものもあるらしい。実績全解除は至難の業だと思う。他にスコアを競うスポット、一回きりのデイリーグラインド、ローカルなマルチモードなどもある。少し残念なのはメニューの遷移方法が微妙に優しくないこと、ステージエディット・シェア機能が無いこと、日本語の誤植があることである。特に最後はチャレンジ達成不可能となるもの（5-5アマのチャレンジ「すべてのグラインド、マニュアル、ローンチなどをパーフェクトに」は「Spinを30回以上決めてフィニッシュ」が正しい）があったので注意が必要。全体としては良いゲームだった。若干値が張るのでセール時にサントラと一緒に買うのが良いかもしれない。			"

												Fantastic game for score-attack lovers like myself. I loved the skating mechanics with the ""easy to learn hard to master"" feel that these kinds of games often have. Many tracks (especially in the 2nd and 4th worlds) featured branching paths that offer rewards (or death).SOME GRIPES:1) DO NOT buy this game if you don't have a controller. This game was NOT made w/ keyboard and mouse in mind.2) The game is surprisingly short. In roughly 5 hours I managed to beat all 5 worlds. I suppose some replayability comes from five-staring levels (which unlocks PRO versions of the levels, and eventually RAD versions) but after a certain point, star objectives become quite obnoxious...CONCLUSION: Fantastic if you like score-attack games and have a controller. Wait for a sale, as its pretty short.			"

												Overall a lot of fun! 8.5/10  I never played the first OlliOlli*OlliOlli2 has  SKATE (EA)  like challegnes throughout the levels.  ex.  score 500,000 * do a x40 combo, etcIt is a very fun little game. I've played about 3.5 hrs and will contiune to roll through the challenges.  It has a really good pace.Beat all challenges on an amatuer-level and it unlocks the respective Pro-level. Beat all Pro-level challenges and it unlcoks RAD mode. Which im assuming is crazy difficult and combo specific.  PROSThe contols feel tight. The game has a one button level reset, so its fast to try and re-try. 2D eliminates the frustrating 3D aspect of SKATE and T. HAWK to 'line up perfectly' for your trickThe challenges are ... challenging. A daily online challenge with Online Scoreboard (you get to practice and then get only one shot)Addicting and quick gameplay, where you'll say ""1 more try"" about 20xCONS:Minor menu annoyancesI paid $2 extra bucks for the soundtrack, but its not that great.  I wouldnt reccommend that. Overall GG			"

												Easy to play, definitely hard to master. The control layout is impressive using both the direction keys and WASD to perform a wide range of cool tricks. I think this layout is comfortable and satisfying when pulling off some sick combos. I definitely recommend a controller for ever more comfort while playing. The soundtrack and art style of the game help to make it that little bit more enjoyable, but the sole of this game are those Olli's.			"

												I really, really like this game. It scratches an itch for me that hasn't been scratched since the early Tony Hawk games. Once you get used to the controls (which actually remind me more of the old Trasher game than Tony Hawk), you can really get into a flow with this game. Having said that, I think there are some problems with input recognition. There seems to be a minimum amount of time you have to spend grinding on a rail before you trick out with anything other than an ollie, regardless of how fast you're handling the controls. Maybe there's a reason for that, but it really just makes the game feel like it's not responding well. I've also noticed that if you want to trick out of a landing very quickly, you have to land in a manual as opposed to landing normally (landing normally gets you stuck in a crouched position for an extra second or so where you can't do anything). I think that the input handling could be done in a way that feels more responsive. Restarting 10 times in a row at the start of a level to land a trick you've done hundreds of times before gets pretty old. But anyway, bottom line: I really enjoy this game and definitely got my money's worth.			"

												I'm just going to get out of the way that I love this game. Now some details: OlliOlli2 is a minimalist skateboarding game which is kind of like a mix between Canabalt and Tony Hawk. In it, you have to complete a track from left to right avoiding a number of obstacles while mixing in some sick tricks. The tricks are built into a simple mechanic using the joystick and requires good timing to stick a landing and keep momentum. Timing is also key in maintaining grinds which are dotted throughout levels. Finally, you can also put in manuals which will maintain your tricks into a (potentially) level long combo. And when this happens you feel like a god, rocking through levels feeling and looking cool (completing optional side quests to get better stars). And for the 100 attempts before it clicks for the level...you still feel awesome because the game has great stylized graphics, music that perfectly suits the ""Just One More Level"" gameplay style and the total lack of a gap between runs had me playing more and more and more. I never got round to finishing the final area but that came down to a period of time away from my computer but that's something I'm going to try and rectify soon.All in all a very satisfying and challenging game!In Summary: 5 rad laserflips out of 5			"

												While I get they encourage you to use a controller, I'm slightly frustrated the game is not quite perfectly responsive using the keyboard (both on Mac and Win). A game like this neeeeeeeds snappy and responsive controls. Literally executing the exact same timing in holding jump and tapping down to land a manual is crazy unpredictable.I haven't gotten a new controller yet that is supported by the newer Windows versions (or Mac for that matter), so maybe using a controller fixes everything. But.... I kind of don't want to. Seeing how the exact same slight unpredictability is on my Windows computer as well, I don't think I'm dealing with 'sticky keys' here. I do have other USB peripherals connected, but both the operating system and game should ignore those as no buttons are pressed through those at all.The game gets a total recommendation nonetheless (I loved the first and the second gives even more moves and levels  etc), but if anyone has the 'golden tip' to improve the overall experience be sure to let me know. And yes, the first game felt more responsive. I've unlocked LOADS in that game, because it never got frustrating to just play. Challenging yes, but never frustrating. This second game is a little meh in how the lack of truly spot on responsiveness ruins my personal fun trying to get the achievements / progress going. It's still great. But well.. you'll get what I mean.			"
