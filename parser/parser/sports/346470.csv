												I've played this game for a few years now and I am glad it's finally on Steam! The developer's hard work has finally paid off and the game will finally get the recognition it deserves.Tennis Elbow 2013 offers gameplay unlike any other tennis game; it's an amazing simulation that is realistic, fluid, challenging, and most importantly, fun. It will take a bit getting used to at first as the game is not forgiving when it comes to placement and timing of shots. However, once you get the hang of it, hitting clean winners becomes so overwhelmingly satisfying. The game comes with a LOT of character customization similar to RPGs by allowing you to choose your character's playstyle and increase your stats/effectiveness in various aspects such as: forehand, backhand, serving, volley, etc.Mods are also an option which greatly enhances the quality of the game. The addition of newer and cleaner 2D/3D courts as well as player models, swing animations, sound effects, clothing, and rackets allow you to customize the game the way you want it to look and play.The most common complaint that I would expect to hear from people viewing the trailers are the quality of the graphics. Though it may not be up to par to the other tennis games out there, the game play is what compensates for it. As mentioned before, you can install mods that makes the game more visually appealing. If you can look past this flaw, I can reassure that you will love the actual game play.Tennis Elbow 2013 is a MUST for tennis fans.10/10			"

Key supplied by developer for review.======================================Tennis Elbow 2013 (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DRWhether in short bursts or long durations, this a tennis sim with depth that will keep you engaged and challenged.======================================Pros+Depth+Realism+Longevity+High skill ceilingCons-Graphics: Probably the game's worst but most insignificant fault.-Controls: A bit clumsy, hard to learn, but intuitive once grasped or mastered.Neutral+/- Sound: Works, minimal, true to life, but low quality.======================================IntroductionWelcome to Tennis Elbow 2013, a tennis simulation featuring painstakingly realistic physics at the expense of graphical fidelity. It supports warmup, practice, campaign, and multiplayer modes, via double or single matches.GameplayThe gameplay in Tennis Elbow 2013 is fast and fluid, but the controls may leave you scratching your head at first. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to not hit the ball straight to the center of the court before figuring out there's a default shot that is performed even if you don't take one. So not only did the default kb+m controls not seem to allow me to take actual shots, but when using a controller, I was under the impression the shoulder buttons would, but they did not. Then I tried using the face buttons, and everything changed.So in TE13, in order to get the ball where you want it, you have to move to get to it, move correctly to take the correct type of shot, and also move to aim the shot once you start to take it. If that sounds like a lot to deal with in a split second, then you are correct, but it is so much fun getting it right and the amount of precision with which you can crush your enemies with once you lock it down.As stated earlier, there are a variety of gamemodes. The AI is quite competent, featuring various levels of difficulty as you ascend the ranks. If it does particularly well or poorly against you, you can opt for higher or lower difficulties. The scoring is...well, like tennis, and the hitboxes for the racket are good. There is an RPG factor here with the extensive character customization present, where you can even select your character's preferred playstyle.I should also briefly mention that the animations are actually pretty nice, and there are quite a few. I don't care for the backpedaling animation, though. At any rate, it is a game that isn't especially fun to learn, is fun to play, and is very fun to learn to do well and play well with.GraphicsSo you're not going to see the shadows and leaves falling off of trees. There will be no sunshafts or lens flares. You won't see much lighting at all, actually. You won't see everything fluttering slightly in the breeze. The character models even, are pretty poor. The physical build isn't too awfully bad, but the lack of lighting and shading and quality textures especially stands out on them, and the UI...the UI is straight out of the 80s.The graphics aren't bad exactly (excluding the UI,) everything is functional and represents what it is supposed to. They just aren't good. In any way. They would be bad if you consider anything not having good or amazing graphics bad, but in the end, this is a game about playing tennis. Even more, it's a simulation focused on tennis. You don't need flashy effects when you hit the ball, or cinematic angles distracting you. You just need to see yourself, your opponent, and the ball going between you two.AudioThe audio quality in Tennis Elbow 2013 is a bit low. There won't be any unrealistic uproar of a crowd 10 times bigger than any crowd ever present, nor any exaggerated effects involving fire and lazers when you hurl your ball 10 meters into the ground creating a crater amidst an explosion. What you get is simple sounds that are there when they are supposed to be. They are realistic in that sense. Hit a ball with a racket, you hear a ball being hit with a racket. On the other hand, the recording quality and the sounds themselves could be much better, but again I must stress that this is a sports sim and not a walking simulator meant to immerse you in deep story and compelling visuals and audio.ConclusionSo, it gets one component majorly right, and two others, sometimes very important ones, very wrong. ""What gives?"" you might say, ""since when is getting just one thing right good enough?"" Well, I will tell you. It's enough when it is this damn fun to experience, however, I should also point out that the game is very capable of being modded, and many people have created packs featuring better/different sounds, player models, animations, courts, etc.What you will get if you purchase this game is a very real feeling of playing actual tennis. In that regard, the game is nearly perfect. So in conclusion:I recommend Tennis Elbow 2013 for any enthusiast, at full price.If you just ""like tennis"" like me, I still think it is worth full price, but you might consider a sale.If you're just interested in getting a competitive or realistic experience, or grabbing any sim that exists, but don't especially love or even like tennis, I would recommend it still, but on sale.======================================If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Fantastic tennis game, just:- Do not expect it to be like Virtua Tennis or other arcade tennis, because it's not.- Do not expect to just start winning, the system takes getting use to.- Do read the modding forum on here and install mods early on (you even get an achievement for it!).- Do read the manual, available at the website. Seriously, it makes the control system make more sense.- Do turn on ALL of the PREVIEWS when you first start. It's a wonderful crutch for learning.- Do not expect graphics to be wonderful, but did you come to play tennis, or look at pretty things?Once all that is done, and you lose your first few matches horribly, it starts making sense and getting fun!

												Although it is obvious that the graphics are outdated and that there are no pro superstars to play with by default, however this game brings to the table one of the most realistic tennis simulation experiences out there. There is a high level of complexity and it is not a simple three or four button game. There are button combinations which makes you do specific shots and player positioning actually matters in this game, which is something you wouldn't see too much in a game like 'Virtua Tennis 4' where you just hold a single button and you playing automatically positions him/herself perfectly to the ball.Thankfully, the files are easily moddable which means that it is possible to bring in tennis superstars if you wish and change other things like tournament settings.I would only recommend this game if you are a big tennis fan and want a complex tennis simulator where you want to be able to have full control of your shots and player, and to also be challenged.

												First off, yes, the graphics aren't very good. Sometimes the players move a bit awkwardly and the overall look of the game (UI in particular) is quite dated. Seeing this initially turned me off from the game, but it seemed like people really enjoyed its accurate gameplay. I had previously played Virtua Tennis 3 on the PS3 and later purchased and enjoyed Top Spin 4 because it was less arcade-y. But Tennis Elbow 13 blows both out of the water in terms of precise gameplay that really simulates tennis.There are a number of things about it that I really like, but the most notable is the realism when it comes to unforced errors. In most other tennis games, it's either impossible to make an unforced error (other than double faulting) or it's ridiculously difficult and will only happen after your player is extremely tired. This means that you can paint the lines on basically every shot without any risk involved. In this game, you have to precisely aim your shot and if you aim too close to the line, you may miss. If you're in an awkward position when you do it, there's a much bigger circle of uncertainty around your aimed shot, so you can easily miss if you go for too much.Some people might have issues with the lack of licensed players, but I personally find the obvious knock-offs absolutely hilarious. Riccardo Fidirir, Nenad Djakavec, and Ruben Nodol will never fail to make me laugh. (Plus, I think there may be mods that you can download to make these accurate)There's also a ton of granularity when it comes to skill customization and opponent level (4 levels, 10 sublevels per level). Overall, I would really recommend this game to people who want a true tennis sim. The graphics don't really bother you after a bit because the gameplay is so good and immersive (the satisfaction of struggling to beat an opponent, but then succeeding 4-6 7-6(4) 7-6(5) is fantastic). However, if you want a more arcade-y game with great graphics, Virtua Tennis is probably the way to go.For anyone who is planning on getting this game, I really recommend using a gamepad. I personally use a PS3 controller connected to my Macbook via Bluetooth and have mapped the D-pad for movement, the X button for topspin, the square button for slice, the circle button for an accelerated shot, and the triangle button for a defensive lob. I find that it works very well. (Normally, I prefer to use the analog stick for movement, but you also use the movement input for shot aiming, which requires a lot of precision. Thus, I use the D-pad, which I got used to pretty quickly)			"

												At first glance this game really doesn't look great - sub part graphics, sound and all around presentation. Yet it absolutely nails it as far as gameplay is concerned. I've been playing tennis games since the C64 and can confidently say that Tennis Elbow 2013 is the best one I've ever played. Games are realistic. Players frequently hit the ball out, double fault, hit the net and miss easy shots. It just feels right. It's not perfect but it is a huge step forward from the arcade style tennis games that've appeared in the last few years.I struggled for the first 2 or 3 hours and lost every match. At first I could hardly even win a point, never mind a game or set. Stick with it for a few hours and the controls will start to feel comfortable. Download the demo from the dev's web site, stick with it for a few hours and that should tell you if you want to buy the game.What else...I'd recommend that you download one of the mods if you want to offline play a fairly realistic pro career. They contain real tournaments, players and venues. You can start off as a 17 year old and progress through the ranks as the years pass. Right now I'm ranked number 992 of the world and have just won my second qualifying match in a tournament. If I win the next match then I'll actually get to play in an actual first round of a tournament. So yeah, starting off at the bottom isn't glamorous but it is immersive and satisfying.Recommended!edit: I've put a lot more hours into the game now and am really happy with it. Once you install one of the mods the visuals get a decent boost and the offline career mode is fantastic fun. A top class tennis game, even if it doesn't look like it at first glance.			"

												Played lots of tennis games, VT, TS etc. Tennis Elbow is far superior in terms of gameplay and realism. Yes the graphics aren't good, and the UI is ugly. But it feels like playing tennis.

												If Virtua Tennis and Top Spin are like Call of Duty, then Tennis Elbow is like Arma. Realistic, hand crafted, and honest to what it portrays. No video game makes the tennis more real and challangeing. You can't walk in and expect to start winning everything. If you do a world tour it will take you time to build your character up to adaquate level to be able to compete. Also the system isn't arcady, it will certianly take some getting use to. However if you want the most honest tennis experience then look no further than Tennis Elbow.			"

												Having played this for a few years away from Steam, what I have to say is that if you can get past the horrific graphics, the horrible animations, the poor presentation and maddening music and focus only on the gameplay......you'll find the best tennis game of all time. Definitely not a casual game, however, and it will take a while to get to grips with how it works. But once it clicks, it clicks and you won't look back. The last great tennis game, Top Spin 3, pales in comparison - you simply won't be able to recreate such variety in rallies and shotmaking that this game offers.			"

Just like the graphics, not a lot of flashy stuff, but great simulation of events and tracking history. The gameplay is great with pleanty of skill levels to advance thru.If you pick this up and have an issue with the controls just stick with it. Use the training club and leave aids on until you get the hang of it. The holding buttons works well to create errors as well as great winners.A must have for tennis fans who have been looking for solid gameplay and career mode.			"

												The game mechanics are fun and it is definitely the best tennis game on PC I have ever encountered all thanks to the long career mode. Names of the professional players have been changed due to lack of license from ATP and WTA. This can be fixed with Sam's Megapatch which is the only mod you need for the game for it to give you the 9/10 tennis experience. The vanilla game is 7/10 so the mod is recommended to get the full experience.			"

												This is by far the most realistic tennis game I have ever played for PC or console. First thing, the learning curve is very steep, especially if you are coming from a game like Top Spin. The controls will feel very different at first and will take some time getting used to. The game is unforgiving when making mistakes. You may want to remap some of the buttons to make it easier or make the controls more like Top Spin/Virtua Tennis.The campaign mode is extremely in depth. It is like a real tennis career starting from the bottom unlike other tennis games. You begin playing Futures tournaments and have to qualify for Challengers and Tour level just like real players. That alone makes it a good challenge and have a lasting appeal. Also, if you want real player names and real tournament names, mods are available for the game. If you a tennis fan, you will enjoy this game.			"

This game is incredibly addictive! It isn't the prettiest game, and the sound leaves much to be desired, but the basic gameplay mechanics are incredibly solid. The game just feels right to play, and it is contantly challenging. I will say that it is an absolute must that you mod this game.

												I got this game based on some positive comments from Steam and other sources, and I think that it's worth the price.First of all, you have to bear in mind that the graphics is not on a very high level, in fact it's nowhere near the average level of gfx in games produces by ""professional"" studios. If you played Virtua Tennis 4, and expect something simliar I must disappoint you  -  the difference is graphics is huge.However, in terms of pure gameplay, I think that Tennis Elbow can defend itself. Matches are quite realistic, and you can choose from a quite wide arsenal of shots. The game offers a variety of options, altering the match diffculty from easy ones (with shot indicators), to more realistic ones. You can participate in tour, creating your player (or choosing one of existing ones), slowly building up your position in rankings, and improving your skills. Each time you enter the tournament you can decide if you want to play singles, doubles, or both (if allowed by ranking).If you are a tennis fan (and I don't see any reason to buy this game if you are not), then there is a real chance that you will like it.Pros:- realistic gameplay- you can set the various difficulty levels, as well as adjust amount of games, if you don't like long matches- good career modeCons:- fake tennis players names- graphics quality (if you care)- I have experienced troubles finding online games			"

												When I first loaded this game up I thought, what on earth is this, very old fashioned layout, really annoying music. Just proves looks can be  deceiving because this is by far the best tennis game out there. Very realistic and great customization. Only caution I may give people is the controls take some getting used to, it's not like Virtua or Top spin tennis where you can just button bash. On this game you have to time your shots, along with the movement of the player. If you can persevere with the controls Tennis Elbow 2013 proves to be the best Tennis game out there, well for the time being anyway. Highly recommended!!			"

												Amazing tennis game !Maybe the best in terms of sensation and realism ! Positioning themselves, anticipate, take risks, manage physical effort, manual aim... You play a human !The learning curve is long, and we discover lot of subtleties over time.So, yes, at the packaging level, it's not Top Spin, for sure ; but I guarantee you that the gameplay of Tennis Elbow surpasses it !His only problem is the fact that it is a niche game for niche players who love a niche sport, and it therefore affects the online and the probability of steadily finding players.Beyond that, TE has this advantage of being easily modded, and some mods allow almost photorealistic rendering, with real courts, real players with real stats, etc...The AI is solid and may give you challenging and strong opponents.My best advice is that you watch some videos on Youtube (especially with mods), and test the demo of the game at this address :http://www.managames.com/tennis/game_en.html "

Well, this is the tennis simulator where you can see how well you understand the game of tennis. The rallies are realistic, the shot placement matters, the tactic matters, patience matters, the way you build your player matters.Sometimes I just feel like hitting a heavy topspin forehand that hurts my opponent.

												A lot of sports games claim to ""get it right"" or as ""authentic"" as possible.  Well, Tennis Elbow 2013 does just that with flying colors!  From the player and court graphics, the controls (with a controller it's obviously easier), tournaments, tennis skills, stat tracking and evolving your player all are accomplished and well done in my opinion and I'm sure you'll agree if you like tennis.  As far as the game play goes, it's not in the slightest convoluted to control your character and it's easy to learn, yet takes a long while to master it.  That goes a long way in replayability as does the online play and tournaments.  The play is smooth and never laggy and it's seriously the BEST tennis simulator I've ever played and I have been playing tennis games since the NES days!  It has everything a tennis game player would want and more!  It's well worth the price of the game and it's a damn great game they put together for us to enjoy!Overall Rating: 9.5/10			"

												Great and realistic, very recommended specially cause you can mod the game at your own taste.Gameplay: you can miss a shot and hit shots to net, different from other tennis games, where you only hit and hit and ball never go out. Player has a current stamina (more usable for world tour play)Training club: you can choose your player and set the abilities.World tour: is very complete and according to the real ATP tour, you can start as a teenager promise, and you can play in futures and little tournaments, or a top player and play majors and Masters1000. Everything can be modded, since has an open engine, you can create:courts, animations (requires 3ds Max 8), outfits, rackets, tournaments huds, icons, mostly everything.Very good playabilty in online.Very recommended.

												If you are planning on buying this game I would say yes, it is worth it if the graphics don't have to be the best. The layout of the menu is a little strange as well as the audio but the gameplay is solid. The game depics realistic physics and if you read the manual before getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the game, you will really enjoy it. Also you can customize a character very in-depthly..... You can make him grunt everytime he hits the ball 11/10			"

												Takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning as it's not like Virtua Tennis.  But when you get the hang of it, you can do a wide variety of shots anywhere you want depending of course on how the balls returned to you.  This is probably the most authentic experience that I got from a tennis game.  I'm still practicing on perfecting my drop shots and lobs.  Also this is a great game to play whenever you want a stress reliever or simply just wanna kill some time.  However, It does take some editting in the game folders to get the game working the way you want.  And you can also edit the players and tours in the data folder.			"

Tennis Elbow 2013 is a great game focused on simulating tennis, the way it's played in real life.The gameplay is designed to mimmick the tennis played by the pros on tour. All players have a set of stats spread into different categories (like Forehand, Backhand, Volley, Service, Movement and Special Shots) accompanied by a specific playing styles (Defender, Power Baseliner, Volleyer etc). All these attributes will determine how powerful and precise your player is and also how many errors they make. The aiming system takes some time to get used to, but you can easily configure the difficulty most suitable for you and practise in the Warmup Mode.The graphics, reminiscent of the early 2000s, are the only downside of the game, while sounds are realistic (and different) for every surface.Career (or World Tour) Mode is extremely detailed, with tournaments every week of the year (including Davis Cup and World Tour Finals championships), full rankings, head to head and other in-depth stats. You can create a new player or choose from the huge list of recent tennis stars and legends, from both the men's and women's tours. Perhaps the best aspect of the game is the huge ammount of mods made by a dedicated community on managames.com. You can add clothes, animations, courts, players or even completely overhaul your World Tour in order to perfectly simulate real life tournaments (for example ATP Patch and WTA Mod).I conclusion, I would recommend this game to any tennis fan looking for a realistic gameplay experience and in-depth simulation, at the expense of beautiful graphics.10/10 I played way too much.Update 11/2016 - Still fun.

												This is easily the best tennis game I have played (console or PC). Some might find that odd, considering the UI and game visuals seem a bit dated. I didn't say it was the prettiest. It isn't, but it's also not terrible, either. The core gameplay is what makes this the best tennis game I have played.The controls are excellent. They take a little getting used to and become second nature after a bit of practice. The available strikes in the game can be mapped to your preference. They are as follows:o Normal Strikeo Short Strikeo Top Spino Sliceo Drop Shoto Defensive Lobo Accelerationo Short Accelerationo Aggressive Lobo Safe StrikeThe game also supports modding and has a strong community that have been modding the various iterations of the game over the years. Several mods add all the real players, statistics, animations, sounds, courts, etc. They also update the UI visuals, which is a nice touch. At this time, there are two major mod packages which seem to have most of the 'best of the best' mods from the community in a nice tidy package:o Sam's Patch - solo World Tour play with all the real pro players (visuals, stats, animations, courts, scoreboards, etc). o ITST - online play with all the real pro players (visuals, stats, animations, courts, scoreboards, etc). This is strictly tennis. You won't be knocking down bowling pins in mini games for example (not that there's anything wrong with that). You will either be playing quick matches, trying your hand at an extensive career mode, or playing against others online.If you really like tennis, this game is a no-brainer. If you are very casual, I would suggest that you download the 14-day demo that is provided on the developer's website. It even lets you play online. This should be more than enough time to see if it suits you. "

												On the surface it resembles a 1980s arcade game with a clunky low-res user interface, the actual internals are remarkably detailed and thoughtful.  I was actually looking for something that resembled a tennis simulator and if you are patient enough to tweak some game and camera settings.. you will find that it can be used to hone timing and on-court reflexes, even to the degree of game strategy.  The split-second timing and decisions in-game does reflect and appropriately affect the strength and effectiveness of the shots,  It also quietly offers a few simulation functionalities that are not found in other tennis ""games"", such as, full game recording, multi-player (split-screen), multi-player (online), real-world pro-player character/stats.. Highly recommend for people who are looking to improve their tennis in the real world!			"

												Best Tennis game ever produced. Don't let my Steam playtime fool you. I've owned and enjoyed this game since way back in 2011 (from the previous incarnations - and free udates to 2013) and must have hundreds of hours logged playing this. No idea but it would be a lot of hours.So what it doesn't look like Virtua Tennis. It's the gameplay that counts. Years ago I'd given up trying to find a decent tennis game that accurately portrayed rallies and wasn't a simple move and hit the ball console kiddie playing toy. Then I googled about and found this. Not only was the actual gameplay superb but in addition there is a role-playing element where you can improve over time the stats of your player in career mode.To some of the new players that think they have wasted their money with this game: well yes graphically it's not amazing and the gameplay may be hard at first, but perservere and you will be richly rewarded with an amazing Tennis game that will keep you going for years. This is one of the few games I've ever played that I consistently come back to. It's been a permanent fixture in my gaming since I started with it 4 years ago. There is no other game that I can say the same thing about.To the few people that have given this a thumbs down after only playing 2 hours or less they need to take a good internal look at what they are looking for in a game. Have they been brought up on photorealistic graphics over gameplay? That is sad for them, because if they don't perservere a little with this game they are not only cheating themselves out of the money they paid for it but also the incredible game this will open up into if they just show a bit of patience. Once you improve at the game, your character improves, you won't give a hoot about the graphics. No 3d photo realistic graphics could possibly play this type of ball realism. it would have to be done 2d like this for it to work in my opinion.Also, if you don't like the fact that the tournaments are not licenced etc - there are 2 very good large mods out there that alter this game considerably. Go look for them. They're easy to find and install.I recommend this game 10/10. But on the other hand, if you would rather play some childish console button bashing no skill involved garbage with pretty graphics like the big studios produce - stay  away from this. This game doesn't want you anyhow.Edit: I've got back into this recently after a layoff from it. I just want to add this:The AI in this game is nothing short of amazing. That is the crowning glory of this game. The programmer must be some kind of genius to have created such an AI that is so realistic. Plus there are so many skill levels that if you are having difficulty then you can adjust it to how you want so anyone can enjoy this game.For the people that slag this game off ---- I honestly feel regret for you. Many of you have expressed that you love tennis games and have played many over the years, yet this one is rubbish. If I think back far enough, I remember I too had difficulty with the controls at first. But seriously if you persevere then you will be rewarded with what is arguably the best Tennis game ever produced. I am serious on that. Please give it another try for your own sake - if you like tennis games THAT much.I have played sooooooooo many nail biting tennis matches thanks to this. It is so realistic. I honestly cannot see this tennis game being bested ever as the majority will not give this game enough time to discover how good it is.I would also add this: When you buy it, download the Sam mod to update for better graphics and realistic players. The developer couldn't add these due to legal restraints. Once you get to that stage with the Sam mod then the game will reward you back hours of gameplay. Again I state, I have been playing this since about 2010 and it has become a permanent fixture in my gaming time. I have over 200 games in my library on Steam. This one is one of the best.			"

												This is not Virtua Tennis ; you'll need a few hours to get the hang on the gameplay ; start should be relatively easy as the easiest CPU difficulty is very low with slow rally pace.There are tons of options to shape the gameplay to your likings ; it can be a good thing or a bad thing, as it can be hard to find the correct setting for your taste.The game looks same than on the pictures, it's not ugly, but it's really outdated technically. Menus are kinda awful, but they do their job (more or less).Except that, it's the best tennis simulation on the market (like in ""realistic rallies"", not like in ""it looks same than on TV""), and if you can't play tennis on a real court, this game is the closest thing you'll get.

												I was really excited to play Tennis Elbow, I loved all Virtua Tennis games and enjoy watching Tennis too. I knew from the videos the game looked bad, and I know not to be shallow when looking at games, but the fact that its poorly optimised, and still doesn't allow me to play it at 1080p without it crashing just isn't good enough. I tried to play the game 3 times and it crashed each time  when I changed the visual settings of the game. I have a 280x so it should work okay with the graphics for this game.After finally accepting my fate at 480p, I got into playing it, its okay, the menus are clunky and ugly, it takes to long to start a career, the sounds are awful, and the gameplay boring and repetitive against the computer. Sadly after wanting this game for so long and finally getting it when it was 45% off, I decided I would refund the game as I was so disappointed in what I had purchased. I hope the dev continues to develop the game and make it better, but I rather play an older ps2/wii game than this.Find my quick review on the game here:

												Waouh, you should see this game. It has been released in 2013 but the menus are ridiculously ugly and misleading. Super Nintendo games were in average way better in that area.So it is a tennis game, the gameplay is the most important. Some interesting ideas are introduced, they make sense.Now I have one word to summarize a game: FAULT!Aiming is stupidely difficult, it is comparable to the full manual mode in Fifa. Services are for the great part, random based.You can miss an important shot, even with very good placement, just because of a random.Yeah it is realistic, but very annoying.Compared to Top Spin 4, the difference is obvious: points are not lasting very long here, the random engine will provoke a fault pretty quickly.Let's finish by the graphics and the sounds. The graphics are catastrophic, worse than a Korean free2play. The sounds are correct and realistic, but I can tell you, you will laugh at the music in the menus, ridiculous.Let's hope that Top Spin 5 finally arrives and ships on PC.			"

5/10 ""Would it be 2005 a great game, in 2015 sadly not."" Oh boy totally a game where I should've checked out a demo at first. I love tennis games and I know there are so few out there. But unfortunately I cannot recommend this game to you. Tennis Elbow might be the best tennis sim out there for some, but for others it's just not contemporary in many aspects. I can see why people like it (real tennis sim enthusiasts), but I can feel the people (TopSpin/VirtuaTennis players) who have/will spent 20 bucks (=15%off) and got/get *this*.Pros:+ great complexity+ great gameplay ""idea""+ good controls+ good features+ very responsive author/producer+ very close community+ 49 MB download (dial-up modem compatible)Cons:- no official licence players- very bad price tag- very bad graphics & animations- very bad sound quality & ui- missing atmosphere- inconvenient control settings(no default xbox one & xbox 360 contoller scheme)- 92MB on disk=> I'd love to ""gift"" this game 10GB on my hardrive & at least 2GB VRAM on my GPU...For me this game could be great - produced in UnrealEngine4/Unity 5/CryEngine3/etc., with a nice ui and with an atmosperic sound&ost.

												Seriously one of the worst games I have played. I have been playing tennis games since the early 90s and have been suffering from the lack of good games of that specific genre. Sadly, this game has not helped. - I do not care much about graphics but they are just ugly. Animations make me feel like it's 1994 again- I have never played a game with such annoying audio. The sounds are of low quality, do not fit and break the game- ugly UI & akward controlsIf this would be open source, it would be an ok game. Demanding 20 Euro for this utter piece of software is just outrageous. I really tried to like it, but this game is just no fun			"

												This is the worst piece of crap I've bought all year. I love tennis, and I'll play the 1999 version of Virtua tennis on my Dreamcast before I will even consider this piece of garbage again..There isn't really anything good to say about this game, so let's start with the bad.The graphincs are comparable to an emulated Nintendo 64. That woudln't be a bad thing if the game was made 20 years ago. The music, the color, the everything is like the game came straight out of 1992. The mechanics of the game are gay as hell, you'd simply have to play it to see why. This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on steam and it is so bad, I'm considering revoking the purchase through my credit card and ♥♥♥♥ing my Steam account all together.OK, so I was a bit drunk when I wrote this review so I went back to try the game out today. My initial review was unfair. Today, I'm going to give this game a 2 out of 10 simply for the fact that it does not require Uplay.			"
