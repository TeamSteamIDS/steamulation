												2.4/10 - About How You'd Expect An Olympics Game To Be...So there are some cool things about this game; there are 26 different events and a career mode to choose from. Some of the movement triggers feel like hitting notes from Guitar Hero; which was pretty cool. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough to put this game into the thumbs up category. It always ruins sports games for me when it's not skill based; meaning once you figure out the moves you can get amazing scores every single time... That's not fun. Also, another killer for me is the audience; no time was spent with this obviously. In a stadium of 50,000 there are only 4 different looking audience members. Even for 2008 that's pretty bad or just lazy. The game will crash if you minimize the screen; and maybe a few other times like it did for me.This game could actually be fun if the multiplayer/coop existed in any capacity. Someone must have been pretty high to think this was still worth $20. Actual Value - $1-3ish Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

This reminds me of a cross between Epix Summer Games and some Konami game I had on the Gameboy.It's not perfect by any means but the range of events is quite wide and there are far more than you first realise - various kinds of cycling, swimming, jumping, running, and throwing stuff. You win shiny things, and break records and your keyboard.It ran smoothly for me and some of the events had a bit of a learning curve. It suffers from some lazy moments (did it have to be rushed out for the Beijing Olympics, I wonder?) but is basically fun.It's certainly not presented in '3D comic style' - more 'trying to be real but not quite getting there because we don't have the money' style. Nor is it worth £15.99 - get it on sale. Until then, watch me butcher it!			"

												If you like sports games then the game is good, BUT when steam says Multi-player and co-op instead of local co-op I assume there is online mp.There is not..			"

												Huge fan of Konami's Track and Field and Hyper Sports arcade games.  This is worse.  I was able to play three events -- high jump, swimming, and 100m dash -- winning the third.There's no frame limiter, so it's just running at 800 fps.  Crashed (to desktop) twice the first fifteen minutes.It isn't horrible, I'd start it up again, and at least play through every event once, but crashes kill my motivation.  The bottom line is that I'd rather uninstall it than contact tech support.			"

												I only played for 2 hours but tried all 26 events, and that was enough. This game sucks. The graphics are bad, the career mode is just a list of events that you must play through, but the really bad part is the controls. Note that i have played similar games but those had a much better control design, making those games fun to play. Here, there are plenty of bad choices. Some play better on a keyboard, some on a controller. If you're hardcore, you may enjoy it, but for me the controls kept me away from having a good time. I'm never touching this game again.			"

												Interesting game, but if you play on keyboard, you will need to change keyboard after few days :DI tried all events in game, and this game isn't for long time to play. I try to be the best in all event, and when i complete the goal I leave from game because I don't know what to do anymore. For me most interesting is high jump. "

												I want a refund because the game was fun but after a couple day all of the events didnt work like when I tried any jump events the keys would not work. So You all need to fix it.			"
