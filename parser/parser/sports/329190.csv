Early Access Review
								Taken from the game's early access description: ""“We have a rough idea on where we want to go with the game, but what the final game will look like, we simply don't know yet!"". This is one more case of what I like to call ""Early access trap"". You pay 13 euros for a game that promises that one day some content might be included in the game, but 1,5 years after I first bought it they barely have introduced anything to the game. Stay away from it.P.S.: Wtf is wrong with people these days? I see positive reviews for a game they barely update, while I see negative reviews on games that update every 3-4 months claiming ""the updates take too long"". IN THIS GAME THERE ISN'T ANY SERIOUS UPDATE.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is simply beautiful. I have always wanted to fly. Ever since I could recall, I looked up in the sky and wanted to be a bird - To fly. To truly fly. I wanted to soar between mountains, inside valleys, around cliffs and over forests.Unfortunately, humans can't do that. But this game...This game does that.There is no story.There is nothing but you, your wingsuit, the mountains and the air.Simply beautiful in its purest of forms.I hope they update the model, but... otherwise... simply, utterly beautiful in its simplicity and awesomeness.If there is one game on all of steam... just one... this is it. This is the one you need to try.			"

Early Access Review
								Welcome to your playground in the sky.Volo Airsport is an extreme sports simulator/action game developed by Ramjet Anvil that is currently available through Steam Early Access. In Volo Airsport you take to the skies as a humble stick man sporting a wing-suit, whether you wish to go proximity flying right up against a ravine or wish to fly high above the world and take in the beautiful views you're gonna have fun with Volo. Despite being available to buy through Early Access for a few months now and being available even before that (DRM-Free) there's not a lot to do right now though from their website it's clear to see that Ramjet Anvil are working on some cool things which will only make the game better. +Good graphics combined with a fair bit of graphical customisation+A unique idea of flying around in wing-suits, obviously this has appeared in some games before but there's never been a full game based around it+Great flight physics which feel realistic+If you so wish you are able to have a predicted trajectory displayed on screen as well as aerodynamic forces (independent of each other) as well as the usual stuff like airspeed indicators and altitude displays+Four different camera angles+Very relaxing to play+The map currently available is quite large but it's smaller than it looks due to there being extremely strong winds which stop you flying that way+VR Support. Now this is something I usually wouldn't care about as I don't really like VR but Volo has actually made me want to get an Oculus just for the first person camera mode flying right up against the ravines+Challenging time trial events+Has a built in time trial course editor for you to make your own courses which can then be shared with other people+Good controls (360 controller, unsure about Keyboard) which include some cool moves for your character, such as curling up into a ball+The HUD can be disabled, allowing you to take some great screenshots of the game world+Great soundtrack which adds to the relaxing feel of the game+Friendly dev(s)-Currently only one map-As mentioned there's not too much to do right now-Shadows are a tad glitchy in first person-It's been a while since there was an update on progress or an actual, downloadable update for the game but it is a very small team with limited resources so it's to be expectedHere's a short gameplay clip I recorded:

A Video of Volo Airsport

			A short clip of Volo Airsport, a virtual playground in the sky. Volo Airsport in available on the Steam Store through Steam Early Access: http://store.steampowered.com/app/329190/ This video was recorded using Bandicam...		


Verdict:8Volo Airsport, while lacking in content, is a fun and relaxing wing-suit game with good graphics, great physics and an interesting concept. If you're an Oculus owner or just someone who enjoys taking a relaxing flight through the skies in a game then this is not one to pass up on.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer of review purposes***El K.

Early Access Review
								***Review Update: 14th May ***TL:DR  Neutral Rating, as of the release 3.6  - Their video shows you all you need know about Volo!This is the first update I've ever experienced since buying this Early Access piece (Nov '15), so stick with me...Firstly, as of this point, 20 out of 21 people found this review helpful.  Worth keeping in mind as it is rated as *Negative*.  I've kept my original review below as it is worth reading through the chain of comments that sparked off, due to my unhappiness, and the responses involved thereafter (10th Apr - 10th May).  To my surprise, the developers were not, as suspected by me, camped out in a bar, but are indeed still working on this project, perhaps with renewed vigour.  Who knows?So, reviewing this again since I've had time to re-play and re-test.  It's definately more stable.  Actually, a lot more.  I regulary had to 'force quit' the previous version as it hung during loading about 50% of the time.  This one for me, had never failed to start since it came in and I've been in and out of it maybe 20 times so far.As for the content change itself, I was hoping for something more significant than a few shacks and hated wind turbines dotted around as eye candy.  However, we are still promised parachutes and multiplayer.  No mention of more map choices as yet, but I'll be keeping an eye out for update news snippets for future possibilities of worthiness.  The sound output has also changed from being active, to passive.  I can't tell anymore just how close I was skimming past surfaces.  Something I loved.  Instead, now it sounds like a flag fluttering at 15mph no matter how close I get  to a virtual surface.  Oh, and there's dynamic grass now!  A nice touch for when you do eventually hit the deck at high speed, but ""Mehh""Why have I rated this as Neutral?  Purely for the following reason.  I would recommend this, but for the lack of proof.  Proof of commitment and fervour.  One released update in 6 months dosen't do them justice.My ultimate recommendation then, is to watch and wait.  Stick it on your wishlist, or follow it.  See for youself if it's worth bothering with in a few months time, or set your own timescale as I can't even guestimate what will happen next with this project.  Perhaps take a chance and buy it if you've got the cash to spare.  To help them out and all that......****Original Review Below****Early Access..  Pahh..    ...Should read ""Early Abandonment""Don't bother with this.  After 6 months of complete silence from the (dare I use the word) devs, my feeling is that you'll just end up feeling robbed while they pocket your cash.    ...Unless some crazy update happens, this review will remain to help guide people away from this as an investment of faith.  6 months ago, I had faith they would pull through and took a chance as there are just 2 people working on this.  As of today, I have every faith that they've abandoned this project and set up camp at a bar.I can barely manage 5 mins a day in it's current state as it just gets boring after a while			"

								We need a proximity flying game, glad to finally see this hit Steam.  Simple, beautiful, challenging. If you are a fan of skydiving or proximity flying this is the game for you, its almost like you can feel and hear the power and force of the air gusts shoving you around.  Nothing beats ripping down a cliffside at 135mph and just one little mistake can be fatal.  The game's physics and mechanics are amazing, the controls are well done and playing with a controller is key.  You actually fly through simulated air pockets, lifts, and gusts while cruising at speeds of 100 to 160 + mph just feet above the ground...well that is the way I like to fly anyways.  The beauty of this game is the map is open, drop in from one of the various spawns some simulating base jumps others simulating jumping out of a helicopter.  Really well done little game how it stands right now, something new finally.   Its early access, meaning not much content small in size around 150mb.  Do not let that discourage you from buying this game, Volo Airsport has a lot of potential here.  Can't wait to see whats in store for the future. A few things I hope to see in the future:ReplaysDifferent outfits, ""wingsuits""Custom spawn pointsCreate your own custom runs placing rings where you want themNew mapsAbility to parachute at the endMultiplayer ""usually not a fan a MP games, but this one would be fun with other players""Map Editor			"

 *Key given by developer for reviewing purposes* Volo Airsport is a gliding game where you glide around areas, and try to complete courses. For now there isn't a ton of stuff to do in the game but don't worry the game is still really entertaining. I do feel like the developers will grow this game into a much bigger game and make it even more fun than it is now. Positives: +Creative.+Pretty original.+Pretty graphics.+Easy to learn.+VR support.+Fun.+Lots of graphical options.+Speed counter and a few other things.+Relaxing.+Course editor.+You can play other people's courses.+Wind.+Good physics. Negatives: -Not a whole lot of stuff to do.-Some graphical glitches here and there.-Only 1 map. Added Notes: This game for now like I said does not have a ton of stuff to offer but if you are looking for a relaxing flying game then this is a game I recommend. I will also probably updates this review once the game has fully released.Overall I rate this game a  7.5/10  pick this game up if you want to glide the skies and just relax for a few hours.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

								In this game you play as a man that is stuck in an endless loop of flight and death. Everytime he dies, he must fly again, only to blast into the ground at 180 kmph. He does some tricks on the way down, barrel rolls, backflips, enough to get the adrenaline flowing. I can only hope that the rush is enough to dull the pain.All jokes aside however, this is definately the best proximity wingsuit flying game to date. Well optimized, handles great with a controller. I am truly exited to see how this game turns out.			"

Early Access Review
[Early Access v.3.4]""One minute was enough, Tyler said, a person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort.  A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection."" -Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club[Long version! (scroll down for short one)]What is it?- a game about flyingHow long does it take?- single jump can be anything between a couple seconds, up to about 10 minutes for now, with an averge speed flight close to earth being about 60-120 seconds... so not really long, but ""A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.""What's the story?- for now: You got kicked out of heaven, you have very short time to live; Learn to fly or die. Make the most of the time you have left, soar through air, fly as close to earth as you can, fly as fast as possible, find the way to never touch the ground, enjoy the stunning sunset above beautiful mountains as your short life as a blue stickman angel comes to an end. There's but a one rule for now - ground is lava.What can i do in it?- master the art of flying, gliding, proximity flying, some other technical terms, AND CANNONBALLING!- download players made challange paths (from Volo forum[forum.volo-airsport.com])   make your own paths and fly them as fast as you can- fly around seeking new paths to fly, new winds to use, making stunts along the way just for the thrills- select a spawn point from which you begin- change the camera view (left foot and right foot(GoPro style), first person, third person, frontal, and free view(two last not really usefull for flying but you can get nice photos ;D))Is it easy to play?- Not at all! For now there's no tutorial, but that's not a big problem since the controls are intuitive and it sets your brain on fire - first, to survive the fall, then to fly as far as you can, finally to fly as close to earth as possible doing stunts while flying as long as you can. It can be frustrating at the beginning, since your experience with it won't be like the trailer, but if you put your mind to it, you'll quickly learn to fly and begin to understand the mastery of the Art of flying!Is it worth it?- depends on how much you're fascinated by flying.If you dig skydiving, wingsuits, basejumping and all that stuff, i think you'll love this game!Despiting not much of content (for now), the game already offers amazing physics to play with, along with captivating gfx. It all feels very natural and realistic.It's challenging - don't only limit yourself to flying as fast as possible. Do cannonballs, make turns, spin around, fly on your back, learn the winds and how to use them and you'll be flying for many minutes in a single jump.Create the crazy course using all of the above and see how fast can you and others make it!The devs are active and communicating with players, and there's a lot of stuff to come![Short version]What can i do for now?+ fly with wingsuit stickman+ select a spawn point+ create, share and download fly courses (sharing and download via Volo forum)+ perform some stunts while flying+ use controllers as well as kb&mouse+ die infinite numbers of times by all kinds of unsuspected wind changes while flying at high velocities straight into the ground or mountains... or just pure suiciding :PWhat can't i do for now?- make the jump by yourself- use parachute to land safelyWhat's in there to come?+ Please, see the official Early Access info[volo-airsport.com]As an ordinary player, for now i'd give it a strong 5/10As an enthusiast that looks for the game about wingsuits, that would give you the thrill of realistic flight, not story based and long, but captivating and moment taking, the score is 7/10 for now.Finally, when the game spreads it's wings (more content), make the score 9/10Final word?I say Volo Airsport is well worth the price as it is now.Some may disagree; it's all about seeing and living the moment and will to master the art of stickman flight. It seems simple, but it's hard to master, with a lot of place to play around with pyshics and aerodynamics.I found nothing better after a stressfull day, than to put my headphones on, play some sweet music and fly the stress out!

								I don't write many reviews, but this game is special, so I ought to start...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overview: Volo Airsport is an amazing game that is currently under early development by the same people who brought you the Aurora Wager (a steampunk-style balloon race to get to the north pole). Volo is all about the freedom of flight in a wingsuit. It is different from other games because it has no real competition, leaderboards, or main goals (as of yet). There are no winners or losers, only people who learn to soar, and those who master the art of faceplanting.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:-Great developer-Cheap price ($13 as of now)-Tiny file size (almost 500mb, takes 3 minutes to download)-Amazing graphics-Oculus Rift and gamepad support-Stunning physics and aerodynamics-Wind and sound very clean and smooth-Friendly developers (have had a chat with Ramjet Anvil and Frank V. more than once about Volo)-Future plans to include parachutes and such--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-Like all indie games, it is still under development and has multiple bugs-Character model rather simple, just a blue human figure (red if you crash hard)-No real goal or point (but that may be the idea of the game, just a stress reliever)-Extremely simple, but controls are difficult (using keyboard)-No instructions or tutorial, you are (literally) thrown off a cliff and told to fly---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, if you are reading this, then you must be considering getting Volo. I have one word of advice:Buy it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game's fantastic, BUY IT. I was just browsing Steam casually the other night and stumbled upon this gem. I was getting it for my Vive, but tbh it's superb without it. If you hold any interest in a wingsuit BASE jumping title (or just flying in general), Volo Airsport will fill that craving nicely. Just be aware it's still early. Duh, ""Early Access"". But where it counts, this game NAILS it. It does an marvelous job of conveying the sensation and speed (shaking camera) of flight. You never feel quite in total control, just someone who is delicately urging chaos in the right direction. It always feels like you're right on the edge of success or failure. This makes skimming a few feet through a jagged ravine and barely blasting out the exit or cornering around large cliffs with your arm almost touching the side at 120 mph completely exhilirating. There's a decent learning curve to understanding the nuances of the physics model and how much a light touch is benficial to effective control, so becoming skilled requires patience, practice, and a LOT of 100+ mph faceplants. I do question the physics at times as your character can flop around like a piece of paper in situations, and there are ridiculous recoveries possible that'd be laughable in real life, but even still it accomplishes what I think it would feel like to pilot wingsuits....and that's what's vital.At $12 it's a steal, but it's VERY bare bones. It's essentially a tech demo with no additional content aside from six peaks to jump with a few lines each, but built on an engine that holds tremedous potential. If content matters to you you may want to think twice as at this stage Volo Airsport's more about experimenting with wingsuit fllight dynamics, perfecting them, and navigating courses. There's no selection of pilots, equipment, timed mode, multiplayer (in the works), career mode, none of it. I mean, the pilot doesn't even have a fully textured or realistic model. The courses are limited and do get repetitive so this is at this point great in short bursts.But don't let these things dissuade you if you enjoy games about flight as the game's still being worked on. More content is coming, and there's supposedly a course editor in the works. While I struggle to recommend tech demos, I cannot recommend this one enough as the gameplay is exemplary so I'd encourage people to purcahse this as it will enable the developers to keep expanding on it. Volo Airsport deserves nothing less.If you've ever wanted to soar like a bird high and scream like an eagle low without actually risking becoming a pancake, here's your chance. Take the leap.			"

								You wish this dream was true. Unfortunately it's not. It'll make you sick. The flight physics are non-sense. There's all these weird quirks like edge of the level pushing you upwards. The graphics are meh. Even the menu where you select which course you want to do is right next to the ground, so half the time you crash before you even start an event. Don't buy this game unless you're researching how to make a better wingsuit game.			"

Early Access Review
								Ever since MS Flight Simulator 1, I've wanted a game that gave me the sensation of flying.  After all the years since, this game is it.  It's almost like the tagline for the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie: you will believe a man can fly.I don't have VR gear, I crash all the time, there's no real goal, you can't land safely, it may never get finished - but I don't care.  I have so much fun gliding and taking in the scenery, I haven't regretted the $13 I paid for it (and you can get it for less elsewhere, including the developer's site.)  For the price of a movie ticket, I pick this up and play for however long and then put it down, to come back for more at other times.  It's relaxing and cathartic.  No software crashes, runs well, and its concept of physical flying works like a charm.These devs deserve support for making a game that is different and already solid.  And I believe they will keep trying to finish it.  I urge anyone on the fence about purchasing to do it.  You'll know well within the Steam two hour return window whether it's right for you.  And I predict for most, they'll be pleasantly surprised.For real fun, try the first person perspective.  Not for the easily queasy but a real trip trying to correct oneself without the avatar to watch.			"

								WHAT I THINK : great game! It can be relaxing or intense if you chose. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~POSITIVE POINTS : can be played with mouse                                 beautiful map and graphics                                gliding / modle movement is realistic                                wind rushing noise fits the motions perfectly~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~NEGITIVE POINTS : few drop points                                one map                                you have to go to the pause menu to respawn when you crash                                you will ALWAYS crash at some point~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I hope they add things like multipul characters that you can fly as (bird, dragon, angel, etc)and an option to have soft music in the background in adition to the wind. More maps as well as day and night cycles would be cool too.Over all I would give it a 9/10 for a glide/flying sim.    :D                               "

								I got this for the Vive but its not what I would call supported. Bad fps with gtx 970 and i7 6700K. 2/10 needs a huge overhaul, basically it needs to be built completely different and I do not see this going to happen. It was a big disappointment when I found out you don't soar around with your arms out holding the Vive controllers, instead it requires one to sit upright with hands on the keyboard or in my case steam controller.

								Is this game taking forever?Yes.Have the devs been working on it the whole time?No, they have been working on additional side projects that they are going to be implement into the main game in the near future. (more or less working on it as best they can)That map looks amazing, are there custom maps?No, there are no custom maps sadly. You will be far more frustrated learning how to fly before you are concerned with a new map anyway. I see a lot of negative reviews, should I not buy this game?That is up to you. Nothing comes close to mastering the feeling of flight in this game, but that is not without much effort at first. That effort can be considered more then this game is worth considering the lack of different maps and/or variety in gameplay. That is where the players are separated, People purchase microsoft flight simulator to actually feel like they might have a sense of flying an aircraft, others choose to play ace combat or pilot wings. This game has most of its efforts masked away behind the actualy gameplay of it itself instead of features it has to offer to the player. This game offers exactly what it promises. A beautiful wingsuite simulation. Not much more right now. That being said, I believe it will be through this team that a good proximity flying game comes out.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI have 980SLI 4.6Ghz 8core I-7 and a dedicated 970 for physx and this game runs like crap, I tried to disable sli, tried lowest settings, and disabled BLoom, motionblur, AA, and AF, and even with EVERYTHING turned off if i look at the sky (no land in sight) and it runs fine, no lag in the headset, look anywhere there is land and it jumps around, drops frames and jerks, making me feel VR sick.Mountains, trees, and almost all other objects ""Pop"" into view as well, which is usettling in VRthe controls are terrible too, the wind buffs you around which would be ok except coupled with the controls being so unresponsive it make even the easiest moves hard, I play a lot of the pilotwings on the 3ds, the same type of sport and the controls were great on that game, LOADS of fun...The VR sickness feeling from the lag even on the lowest settings was horrible, and there was no great music like the trailer just lame music in the background, this needs a lot of work.

								Can't believe that some people recommend buying this product and no other game. (I'm calling it a product because its a long way from a game). This is severely unfinished, it resembles the quality that comes from a game developer class playing around with flavour of the moment game engine. There is not much to do right now, except to fall to your inevitable ""death"" - which isnt in the game yet either. It is a playground being the point, well a playground should be fun.Comparing this simulator to other unique niched simulators like ETS2, this games features looks pale in comparison (even Goat Simulator packs more features) and it need some development time, maby it will be good in 2015-2016. It may be a cool experience with Oculus, then again - it may not be.For now i cannot recommend this product. Wait and see.			"

								Awesome game for the price!  Definitely watch the tutorial in the menu before starting out as the flight mechanics might not make as much sense if you don't.  One thing I noticed is that if you start on the left or right side of the map and go further left / right, you will eventually hit a spot where you cannot fly any further and just sort of stop moving forward.  What's odd is I can see landscapes and everything, but it seems as though you are restricted from flying further.  This wouldn't be a huge deal except there are some really good lines that lead straight into those spots and it makes for a pretty big buzzkill when you just can't keep flying the line.All in all, I would say that it's worth the buy.

								I've played some single player flying games before, as well as JC3(although the wingsuiting in that is a little weird IMO) but this game take wingsuiting over the top. The game isn't even finished yet, and I've already put in some hours. The community is super friendly, which is hard to find these days, th devs are always active on the forums, and overall the game is really fun. You can cruise at high altitudes if you would like, or you can go 2 meters of the ground and do barrel rolls of a cliff and a back as well as a front flip as well. The game is super fun to play and overall this game is Way Too good to be an early access game. The progress is a little slow on the game, but that you can expect with a small developer team, and the next thing on their list is parachutes and multiplayer. Think about it. The game is fun WITHOUT PARACHUTES AND MULTIPLAYER. That goes miles to tell you how good this game is. I would Highly recommend you pick up this game, whether to back up the idea or to play the game for long periods of time without stopping. PICK THIS GAME UP.			"

								If you ever dream of flying a wingsuit, this is the perfect game for you. There are still a few things missing, like proper models and parachutes, but gameplay wise the game feels nearly finished.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the only Rift supported game available so far that I enjoy casually jumping into every night. The physics are very good, the play is relaxing and easy to reset and do again. Even without being fully fleshed out I can already see the potential. Worth it for a good zen experience that doesn't get old.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played some single player flying games before, as well as JC3(although the wingsuiting in that is a little weird IMO) but this game take wingsuiting over the top. The game isn't even finished yet, and I've already put in some hours. The community is super friendly, which is hard to find these days, th devs are always active on the forums, and overall the game is really fun. You can cruise at high altitudes if you would like, or you can go 2 meters of the ground and do barrel rolls of a cliff and a back as well as a front flip as well. The game is super fun to play and overall this game is Way Too good to be an early access game. The progress is a little slow on the game, but that you can expect with a small developer team, and the next thing on their list is parachutes and multiplayer. Think about it. The game is fun WITHOUT PARACHUTES AND MULTIPLAYER. That goes miles to tell you how good this game is. I would Highly recommend you pick up this game, whether to back up the idea or to play the game for long periods of time without stopping. PICK THIS GAME UP.			"

Early Access Review
								I have to be honest, the concept is great and the mechanics feel good. But the state the game is currently in does not satisfy me. There is no way I can succesfully finish a flight, because no matter how well you've flown, you will always end up crashing into the ground because there are no parachutes in game yet. There is basically no ending, which makes the game feel like we're just testing the flight mechanics - and that's it.I understand this release is an early access release, so I shouldn't expect to see a finished game. I'm just commenting on the current state of the game.Other than that, Volo is looking promising, so we'll see what happens!			"

Early Access Review
								The feeling is simply awesome and it's based on aero dynamic mathematics! About the negative reviews: Consider this is a single person, who's doing the game with the help of another programmer. There is still life AND the internet that has its demands! And these are ruthless, especially for indie devs who try to get something up AND survive. And it's not easy to get the deserved attention, when millions of games are poping up like rain drops falling from the sky. Have indulgence. Start making a game yourself and then try to get the attention! You need 24 hours and you need to be the hell of a writer to get a small peace back from the oversaturated community! I bought the game to support the developer and if it needs its time, then it's supposed to be like that. If not - then it still was my decision to pay the money. Stop complaining about it. That's what greenlight is about. If it works, then it works. Every promise can be shattered by the brutality of developing and marketing a game or simply cause you can't pay your rent. It's a normal thing. And a lot of indiedevs suffer from this issue..  Sorry for my bad english.			"

								It's really fun and pretty relaxing. Just grab a controller and chill. Currently it's not to indepth but they will add more things to it like multiplayer. In the mean time It's probably worth a pick up.			"

Early Access Review
								Very solid physics based game with a very serene feeling I genuinely hope this game has more content added and more players come to it as it's tightly designed with a lovely looking enviroment (though the mountains could do with some scenery, animals etc or even a seperate urban enviroment for a wild change of scenery). I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of flight based games controlling the wingsuit is both an intricate and simplistic experience that makes the game shine. The only things I believe that are missing from the game in its current state would be different suits with different aerodynamic properties and some more life to the world, I cannot wait to see where this game goes with its content!

Early Access Review
								As of v3.6 this flight sim is already a 10/10. The sense of speed is incredible, scenery gorgeous, flight mechanics easy to pick up and play and challenging without frustration. There are a lot of ring courses already and they are great, but picking your own ""line"" and proximity flying is such a visceral experience here. Just cause 3's wingsuit is amusing and fun but Volo Airsport is the real deal. No comparison, but if you liked the wingsuit stuff, Rico woukd be jealous of this game. The devs are doing bi weekly video updates, which is awesome for early access. Looking forward to the upcoming mechaniic of parachutes!I love the live editability of the environment/weather/night-day cycle.My new favorite ""play some music and chill out after work"" game. Seriously lowers my blood pressures but raises my heart rate and keeps me smiling.Long live blueman!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is pretty cool, but its easy to get vertigo sickness playing it.  The mouse or a gamepad isn't sufficient as a controller.  In my humble opinion, the vive controllers (or oculus touch controllers) should be used based on the user standing or sitting with the controllers with their arms outstretched to either side, controlling movement based on the controllers current axis of orientation.  Minor wrist movements would be required for control.			"
