OverviewThis is the 8th edition of the Front Office Football franchise. It's a franchise that has come a long way and continues to impress more and more people. Much like the other mainstream text-based sports games, such as Football Manager and Out of the Park Baseball, it feels and plays much more intimately than a Madden Franchise mode. With that said, let's get into the review!Pros‣ Real Players: The real names of players are included, and they are on their real teams.‣ Customizable Players: You can customize their name, number, and even attempt to change their position.‣ City Relocation: One of my personal favorite features is that there are a TON of cities that you are able to move your team to, but it isn't easy; you need to get a new stadium approved, which is hard to do in small cities. Other things are involved as well, such as the cities' other entertainment options and their desire for a team/closeness with other teams.‣ City Growth: The cities, along with what was mentioned above, grow on their own. For example, the South could experience rapid growth, sparking a huge growth rate for the city of Orlando. In turn, this could lead the owners of the Jacksonville Jaguars to move to Orlando. The options are nearly endless.‣ Playoff Chances: After Week 5 of the regular season, the game allows you to simulate the odds that the teams left in contention make the playoffs. This is a new feature from FOF7, and just adds even more value to this game.‣ Endlessly Deep: The game is deeper than the Mariana Trench. In all seriousness, it has more realism than anything I've ever seen. You can design your own plays, set up your depth charts, and much, much more. You also have the option to leave all that to the AI and just focus on signing and managing the players. This deepness is a result of the hard work that the developer puts into each and every aspect of the game.‣ Great Help Menu: The amount of depth of this game could and should leave you a little lost, but the help menu provided in game is incredible at explaining what everything is and how they all work. Give it a read.Cons‣ Team Names: The teams do not have their real NFL names or logos. However, this is an easy fix due to an incredible community and the in-game team name changer.‣ Crashes: If you play this game long enough, you will occasionally run into crashes. Not a big problem, just remember to click that save button!Final ThoughtsThis game is incredible. If you find yourself looking at this review, the odds are, you want this game. You will like it. If you are a football fan, there is a 100% chance you will like this game. Unfortunately, my team has less than a 0.1% chance to make the playoffs this year. Oh well, there's always the 2098 season!			"

												Here's the deal. This isn't a new game. It's the 8th iteration, modification, and improvement of the best American Football Franchise simulator around. A true indy, one man written and developed, you won't find fancy graphics or big budget presentation, but you will find statisical accuracy, the challenge of the draft, who to resign when your team runs up to the cap and all the frustration of running the Cleveland Browns franchise into the ground, year after year. New and rewritten for FOF 8  are playbooks for teams, along with thousands of playcalling combinations, personnel packages. You'll be able to import entire playbooks for your team, design your own plays, or let the AI handle all of that for you. You'll have to deal with contracts, inactive players, injuries, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off rookies who think they are really something special. You'll have to deal with career ending injuries, cap management, the challenge of trading players, draft picks, or all of the above for that shot at Ricky Williams (GO YOU!!!!)Players will boom and bust like in real life. You'll get to track their progress through training camps, and they'll need playing time if you want to get the develop quickly. The draft can be where you decide on who to fill out your roster with. There'll be players with skill but terrible combines, players with terrible skills who are amazing atheletes, and you'll eventually get a shot at players with the total package. How you manage all of that, who you draft, sign, trade will be totally up to you. The game will track the stats for all players, all teams, for the life of the game. You'll create a world all your own. The game is very deep. There isn't a pro football franchise simlulator with the kind of under the hood mechanincs that this one has. There are numerous ways to personalize the game through settings, like alternate player files, importing custom graphics, fog of war settings, and getting fired for sucking ♥♥♥. Start the game with stock teams, a full draft, or a preference draft where you put emphasis on player groups and the scout does the drafting for you.If you didn't think that this was overwhelming enough, all this can be played against human managers in the many multiplayer leagues, some that have been going on for years and years, or new ones that are bound to start. There's no challenge like matching wits with human GM's in FOF. You're guaranteed to be humbled. Even though the help file and manual is robust, you can find answers to questions on the game, strategy, modifications and find a multi player league to join at Front Office Football Central, the unofficial home for all things FOF. http://www.operationsports.com/fofc/index.php "

												Your best outside linebacker is holding out.Sam has been good for your team in his three seasons, since you drafted him out of Florida State in the second round of the rookie draft. You thought he'd develop into a solid pass rusher -- and that came true. 6 sacks last season was third best on the team. But as training camp approaches, and your roster is starting to gel -- he thinks he's worth a raise. You look over his performance -- pass rush great, but he's only been so-so in coverage. You've got another guy who could play in the role, but Sam is better -- and he's better than anyone who you could find in free agency. But you have some gameplan ideas that might help use him effectively and limit his liabilities. He wants to be making $3 million a year -- and if you give him that money (with guaranteed bonuses) it might squeeze out your cap space to re-sign your game-changing tight end next year. You make the call... it might hurt to pay him this much, but he'll be angry if you don't pony up.Interested yet?THIS is the essence of Front Office Football. This isn't a button-mashing game. This isn't about absurd stats and silly power-ups. And this isn't a game which will test your graphics card. It's going to test your brains, your balls, and your gut instincts. This is a game where you... ""put yourself in the front office.""Your tools are scouting reports, rookie combine data, on-field statistics, and personality traits. Your decisions include salary cap management, roster-building, young player development, depth chart decisions, gameplan architecture, and finding value where others might miss it. Take on as much control as you want, turn over details to your hand-picked staff if you prefer. You can run the whole show, be just the GM, just the coach/gameplanner, or you can call the plays yourself in-game from a vast menu of options.Play a whole career, build your team in your own image, and tune your skills for a great challenge across a robust universe of multi-player leagues, with options to suit nearly anyone's tastes.If anything I'm describing above is what you're looking for in a football game... you owe it to yourself it play this one. FOF 8 takes a long tradition to a new level, and is a must-buy for the under-the-hood types who love the gridiron.			"

												I've played the FOF games for years and they've always been great in every way except one -- presentation.  If you have to have nice graphics, or really any graphics, then this is not the game for you.  But if what you want is a deep and accurate simulation of NFL football, then this is the only game in town.Among the new features, my favorite by far is the updated log.  It now spells out everything about the play, who was in at what position, and even gives a grade for each player.  It's a magnificent addition that allows you to evaluate how your players are playing throughout the game.  It is almost certaily possible for someone to make a graphical viewer using the information given in the log that would dsiplay at the very least what the formations looked like and highlight who did well and who didn't.  If such a thing were added to Solevision it would finally make that feature useful for me.A feature I'm not quite as keen on, at least not yet, is gameplanning.  I usually want to play as GM anyway, but if I were to want to try my hand at coaching, making a plan is too laborious a process as it stands right now.  It needs some streamlining before it's user friendly enough for anyone who approaches it casually.  Fortunately, the game makes fine gameplans on its own.And this is reminding me of another of my favorite new features.  It's such a small thing, but it makes a big difference.  Coaches now have styles.  It's no longer so easy as hiring the best young coach you can -- he also needs to fit your team.  Or, if he's too good to pass up, you'll need to make changes in your team to accomodate his style.And of course the best part of the game is its ability to generate decades of NFL-realistic stats as you play.  I have never seen a more accurate NFL sim than the FOF series, and I think this one is probably the best one yet.I'm stoked about the new release and look forward to many years of enjoyment.  And oh yeah -- one thing that's easy to overlook about this game is how well supported it is by its developer.  It was only just released last week and we've already had the first patch, which fixed all the issues that I had any trouble with.  The developer also likes to surprise us with updates (for free!) whenever he has something new.  This can be something as simple as a roster update, to even including major new features.  I'm not promising unannounced new features will happen but I can tell you that they have happened before.  Other developers would make you pay for your yearly updates.  Solecismic won't promise them -- or even really let you know they are likely to come.  But when they do you'll just wake upone day and have them.So I recommed this game and its developer wholeheartedly.  If you like sports text sims that are accurate and realistic, you can't do better than this one.			"

												Front Office Football Eight is the most ambitious and feature-packed version ever of this award-winning series. The game shines as a career sports management sim about American Football. You can play an unlimited number of seasons, choosing to build and rebuild your team through the draft, free agency, and/or trading. It has a strong and challenging Single Player AI, and has full 32-human multi-player capabilities as well. If you've ever wanted to try to run an NFL franchise, you definitely want to give this game a shot. There is an active user community at Front Office Football Central[www.operationsports.com]. You can head over there for detailed discussion of the game, strategy tips, and to find multi-player leagues to join.I have owned every version of FOF, dating back to 1998. This is--by far--the biggest and best quantum leap forward for the series.			"

												I used to be in love with the franchise mode in Madden.  I would often let my coaches run the game, and just keep drafting, acquiring, and building up talent like a GM.  I looked forward eagerly to each new Madden with the various updates for the franchise mode on any given year.  I posted about my GM obsession about Madden on MaddenMania, and talked about how I would love Madden to really embrace what it was like to be a GM, and to really flesh out franchise mode as much as possible.  Someone said I was just describing a game that already existed and pointed me to FOF.  I saw it was everything I had hoped for.  I come to FOF.  Now, you can do a lot more.  There's massive expansion of playcalling in this iteration.  You can do a lot.  And it let's me live vicariously through the game.  Don't like what's happening in real life?  Change it!  This year, I took my beloved Jags (instead of 2- and suck) to 11-5, won the AFC South, lost to the Raiders in the divisional round, and had a lot of fun doing it.  No sports sim is as detailed, fleshed, or as realistic as this one.  It's worth picking up.  And it's another strong, stable-from-release product that you expeect from Jim over at Solecismc Games.

												I love sport video games in general from arcadey games like tecmo bowl and the bigs to more serious similuation games like MLB the show , ""madden"" , OOTP and front office football. I was introduced to this series by a friend a few months ago and loved it. I read that the creator was going to make a sequel so I waited for the release(I do this with sport games in general since they're typically the same with a few graphic upgrades and such. This game has a lot more changes from the original than I thought it would have but overall the gameplay is still much the same. The AI is more advanced , the playcalling is much more advanced , the graphics are updated and you can always mod them to how you like,  the record keeping is also advanced. My biggest issue would be I can't have a seperate window for division standings and the simulation window which I loved to look at. One thing I love about this developer is that he immediately works to fix bugs , update the game and overall just take care of it , alongside that is the very supportive and active community that releases mods and programs to help the user's exprience with the game. overall if you're looking for a american football simulater this is the game to get , probably the only major football simulator out right now now called madden.

												Front Office Football Eight is the best professional football simulation game out there.  The way I am able to immerse myself into running an NFL franchise is incredible.  All aspects from the player draft, free agency, to setting offense and defense game planning is incredibly detailed.  The fact that a patch has already been released within a week of the initial game says a lot about how the developer cares about making this product great.  Don’t hesitate to purchase this game.  You won’t regret becoming part of the Front Office Football family.			"

												This is the best version of the best pro football simulation on the market.  Version 8 has revamped a lot of the playcalling aspects, almost all for the better.  The game goes into offensive and defensive philosphy to allow you to really feel like you have control over the team you are building.  If you see a player in the draft with great potential, you still have to decide if he fits the team that you are trying to build.  It isn't just about plugging in good players without a plan in mind.The game also allows you to set pretty much every aspect of your team to AI control.  This lets you focus on what interests you.  If you want to simply build the team as an owner/GM and not worry about the day to day aspects of the team, you can do that.  If you want to build every single play in your playbook and call every single play of every game, you can do that, too.Version 8 has also added fast simming to allow your league to build up a history (all teams on AI control) with one click.  That is a nice little feature to add.I am enjoying this as much as I have enjoyed any version of the game since the first one I played (FOF2).If you like sims and you like football (or even if you only like one of the two), it is a definite buy.

												Another version of the greatest football simulation out there! Even more data at your fingertips with version 8! If you like NFL football and text simulation games, this is an easy must buy. Head over to the FOFC forums to get logos/mods for the game. You are the GM and do can do as much or as little as you want, hire coaches/coordinators, scount the draft and look at the combines, put together a gameplan/playbook each week or trust in your head coach to set your depth charts and cocah your team as you watch from the pressbox. Very deep and accurate NFL stats.			"

												An enormous advancement in a long-running and successful franchise.Beyond what we have come to know: rock-solid engine, rock-solid single-player experience, and a vibrant online community, there is now the ability to exercise total control over your team's fortunes with an extensive playbook and gameplanning interface.Create your own plays and put them into your own playbook (or recreate your favorite NFL or college playbook).  Take total control over your favorite team's roster.  Study your opponent and create a game plan designed to maximize your strengths and exploit the other team's weaknesses.  Guide your team to the playoffs and prosper--or, if you fail, decide whether you need to rebuild through the draft or whether you are just a free-agent signing away.			"

												The latest evolution in the Front Office Football series takes things in a new direction with increased control and flexibility in playcalling.  I've always been a big fan of the series, so I'm not surprised to find a lot of fun in both the new and familiar aspects of play so far.  As a GM-level simulation, the game is still very much the gold standard for football and a very easy way for me to lose hours of time building a roster.  The new gameplanning and playbook features are a vast new layer to the experience that I won't pretend to fully grasp yet.  It has always been one of the great aspects of this series that there are some features that take quite a bit of play to unravel, and I look forward to the discovery process of digging deeper into them.Overall, it's a great game that has provided many, many hours of enjoyment for me over the years.  The new version looks like more of the same on the enjoyment front, with a whole new system of schemes, playbooks, and gameplans to explore.			"

												Front Office Football is simply not for everybody.  It's a management sim.  It's a General Manager sim.  It's a Gameplan and Roster Management Sim.  The developer has taken realism to a whole new level.  Season stats are realistic.  Player careers are realistic.  It's almost bizarre how much detail the developer (a one-man independent developer) has put into the games details.  To put it into context, he's beaten EA Sports and their ""Madden"" teams of developers in the player development and gameplanning without breaking a sweat.  Sorry Madden fans, no graphics or action here, it's just a different type of football computer game.			"

												Other reviews have gone over what's good with the game and I concur with those reviews.Here's why I ultimately can't recommend it.  Let's talk rosters. Each player is graded on a scale from 1 to 9, with 1 being a scrub, and 9 being a rare Superstar.  So the game ranks all the players, but their individual attributes are NOT ranked, only their overall skill.  Example: If Todd Gurley has a grade of 7 the game will randomly determine his individual attributes based on that 7.  We know that Gurley is a bruiser with average speed.  When you start your league, however, the game may look at that 7 and determine that Gurley's actually got 9 out of 9 speed and 4 out of 9 tackle breaking ability. It's completely random every time you start a new league.   You can manually override this randomisation and assign the attributes you desire (at least in single player mode), but there's no in-game option to do so, you first have to export a player.csv file and then edit a spreadsheet using Excel and then import your newly edited file into the game. To make matters worse, the spread sheet is highly abbreviated forcing you to consult a legend frequently to make edits.Additionally, many of the game's overall grades for players seemed way off.  Example: Aaron Rodgers was a 5 out of 9 while Brady was an 8 out of 9.  Vic Beasley, who just led the league in sacks, was a 2 out of 9.  I tried a fantasy draft and it had Carlos Dunlap as the best overall player in the league while some of the elite players like JJ Watt were average at best.  And this is all due to the randomization.The rookie draft was also odd.  There's not a way to scout players manually.  Instead, your coaching staff's ""Scouting Ability"" attribute determines the accuracy of the grades that the potential draftees get.  There's no other way to ensure you're drafting good players that I could see.The UI is another negative.   It's drab and unintuitive.  Small font and abbreviations for nearly everything make it a chore to navigate.  I also never found an easy solution to organizing the depth chart or making substitutions.  I'm sure the feature exists somewhere, but I was nearing the 2 hour mark of the game I didn't want to go over my time limit so that I could ensure the refund.Hate giving this a thumbs down, as there's nothing else like it out there, but it needs massive changes to it's logic with rosters and UI to be enjoyable.

												I have owned every version of this game.. Does anyone remember the first version when you could bet on the games.  I thought that was awesome.  At the time, nothing else came close to a sim game of football.  Even today, nothing comes close.  The last couple of version I never felt like I was truly in the game.  This game for me at least has that immersion factor.  Setting up the game plan, plays etc.  I now actually feel like a coach in a football simulation world.  This is truly the best version of the bunch..Awesome job Jim!!   Here are just two things that I hope get put in.  Standings, would like to see home and away wins/losses.  The next thing is watching solevision, being able to see ball position on the field moving back and forth like coaching mode in previous versions.  big yellow block of space up above not fully being utilized.  Those two things would make this the perfect football simulation in my oppinion.			"

												Front Office Football 8 is a great game. If you are a sports sim lover or just interested in football, this game is for you. This is actually the first game I have bought from the series and I am hooked! I have played many other sims such as OOTP, and this game is comparable. This gaIt has a great community. They help you with any question you have, even if it's a stupid question about NFL rules or how formations work. My only gripe with the game is the UI is slightly outdated and unlike OOTP: Baseball, you can't adjust ""sliders"" or NFL rules. Overall this game is a great football sim (Very realistic, and there isn't a year limit so you could play to year 3000 if you wanted to!). 8/10 (worth a buy!)			"

												You've spent years assembling a competitive football franchise, and you've finally seen the success you have anticipated. It's the Superbowl, and you're down 35-28 with two minutes left. Your franchise QB (dare I say future Hall of Famer?) leads a decisive two minute drill to tie the game at 35-35, and for the first time ever the Superbowl goes into overtime. You receive the kick and once again drive down the field, but you are stopped near the opponent's 40 yard line. It's fourth down and 1 yard to go, and it's too far to kick a reliable field goal. You could punt the ball away, but your defense has been exposed today, and you doubt that they can hold. You could go for the first down, but if you fail you'll give your opponent's high-flying offense the ball back with a chance to win the game in excellent field position. Weighing your options, you finally decide to try and go for the first down. You line up in a power run formation, with your opponent in a goal line formation, and you run the ball straight up the gut of the defense. Your RB takes the handoff -- and is stuffed by the opponent's defense.You turn the ball over on downs and the opponents march down the field and score the game-ending field goal.Only then do you realize the sheer effort required to create a championship franchise, and only then do you realize you could lose it all in overtime of the biggest game of the year. There are no medals for valor, and no trophies for second place.But hey -- at least your franchise left tackle is signed to a team-friendly deal for the next five years. Surely if we've made the Superbowl once we can make it again?			"

												This game is different than past iterations and takes a bit getting used to the layout and where to find things, but it is a Solecismic game and that means something. It means that this game was put together with thought and care and will be supported like few games - or none. I've purchased every FOF game that has come out and will continue to do so. This game has depth and replay-ability like very few games out there. If you like tinkering with a sports franchise and building something for limitless years to come, this is your game.			"

												I'll always recommend FOF for any sports simulation fan..HOWEVER, as someone who's been playing FOF for 15+ years, I was a little disappointed by this particular release. I've been playing it plenty and I enjoy it (hence the thumbs up) but as a fan of the Front Office area of football, there just wasn't enough added to this game. I understand a lot of players get their enjoyment from playcalling and game planning but I was looking for more additions to the scouting/free agency/draft that really went unchanged for the most part and really have been surpassed by most sports simulation games. Free agency is about as basic as can be and there's really no scouting to be done outside of an ""interview"". Also, don't get me started on the staff ""draft"".Again, still a solid game and absolutely worth playing.....just disappointed by the lack of additions to this game outside of playcalling/gameplanning.

												I have been a long time fan and player of FOF. This version is the deepest version to date. If you love building a franchise, this is a game for you. If you are looking for a Madden type game of graphics then this is not for you. If you are looking for the closest thing to real football simulation then this is it. The new gameplanning option in this version is so deep it is mind blowing. I am having more fun playing this version so far than any previous version. The support you get from this game is the best you will see out there. Within a few days of releasing a patch came out that rectified some of the bugs that were noticed during its initial release. This is one of the reasons I buy this game as the support is fabulous. "

												I have been a player since FOF2.  Each iteration is eagerly awaited and better than the previous.  The simulation is best suited for those who want substance and not button mashing.  The developer is conservative with the GUI, but committed to a solid simulation.In FOF8 the major changes to game planning are solid new (optional) turn in the life of the franchise.			"

												I've been playing FOF for 10 years or so. Mr. Gindin has done a great job with improvements and new features over the years, and FOF8 is the latest example. FOF8 has a brand new gameplan approach that promises to be a major challenge for FOF fans. Rookie player evaluation has also evolved into a realistic analysis of combine numbers for stat fans and scout opinion for a more ""subjective"" approach. FOF is not for everyone. If you want something immersive that is complex and numbers oriented, give it a try.			"

												If you've ever played games like Madden or the old NFL 2K and found yourself more interested in managing your team than playing the games, then this might be the game for you. Once you get past the admittedly outdated UI, you will be hard pressed to put this game down as it can have the ""one more turn"" effect that Civ has as you push through multiple seasons attempting to compete for the Super Bowl. You'll watch with delight as your 1st Rd QB develops into a superstar, then struggle to hold the team together as contract negotations take place in the offseason.  Do you give into his demands and potentially lose great players at other positions or drop him and hope to draft a new franchise QB so that you can keep other top caliber players as well?Decisions like these can make or break your team for years, which is what keeps people like me coming back for more.

												Best football simulation out there.I've been playing it since 98 when you had to send in a money order to Jim's house to get the game.A couple things I really like;- I love the new screens, being able to open as many player cards as I'd like.- Creating an actual playbook with plays, if you want your TE to get the ball just make sure you have plays with him as the primary.- Most complex version Jim's made, you really feel like you are calling a game like a real NFL cordinator.- Stats, stats, stats; All the stat collecting you could imagine.- There is so much to this game, just buy it already.Thanks again Jim for your dedication to your profession.

												 I owned both Front Office Football 7 and now 8. The game has been improved. You can now choose to run multiple realistic offensive formations and choose your own defensive plays. You have more options on defense to change your preferred personnel. It is disappointing that you can no longer set a depth chart for each personnel grouping. Another criticism of the playbook is that you can only randomly choose your plays. The idea is, you have to choose up to 100 plays out of 200, but you do not choose the 100. Instead, you have to change the ""threshold"" value and it chooses the 100 out of the 200. If you do not like a play, you have to change each part of the play. You are not given a bank of plays to choose from. So unles you want to try every variation on your own, then you stuck with using the ""threshold"" feature. Later when choose which plays to run in each game situation, it is much easier to manage because you can then choose from, the bank of 100 plays chosen in the previous stage of the game. Criticism of the MP aspect. The game system may be fine when playing as a single player because you can act as a coach during the game and make decisions yourself. In MP the games are sim, so you are at the mercy of the coaches you had chosen. Why is this problem? Coaches are key as a GM, but yet, there are very little attributes you can choose from a coach. In FOF7, you can choose the percentage of run to pass plays in a given circumstance. In FOF8, that percentage is no longer present. It is based on the plays you have listed for a given situation and most will have a combination of run to pass unless you set it up differently. it would be different if the game added position coaches and more attributes for the coaches it does include, so that you can make a better decisions on how you want your coaches to conduct the games. Another criticism is drafting. You get a grade and given a rough sketch on the players ability. You can ""interview"" players, but you only have 12 you can perform. The interview only marginally make it more define. It would be nice have the players colloege performances as well. More interviews and more information to help you make a better decision or bad one. LOLAnother change I would like to see is the ability to sign players when I am above the salary cap. Sounds weird, but I like to be able to bring ion guys and then make a decision later. I thought teams can be over until a certain point anyway. It is miner (no I took over a team in a poor financial situation..LOL) I would reccomend playing the game in MP. It is infinitly more fun. Without MP, I think I may fine this game too dull. MOP games are not that time consuming with the exception of the draft and early set up of your team. I know what I wrote makes the game seem unenjoyable, but believe me it is enjoyable to play. Very adictive and fun. If you like football and is critical of your teams choices in the front office, then this is the game for you. If you like pla calling and don't mind SP, then this is a game for you. Way better and more realistic than Madden for sure. Pike			"

												Those that enjoy highly detailed graphics, have amazing skillsets when using game controllers and appreciate a win over an opponent that is based upon taking advantage oh their lack of similar skills the move on, this isn't for you.  On the other hand if you are cerebral, enjoy the sport of American Football and can appreciate it's inherent iintricacies, much like chess, the step up, you have found a game and challenge that is for you.  Primarily a text based sim that has matured very well with every rendition offered by the one man team that created, developed and supports it.  You will be required to make an investmate of your time to understand the layout and construct but once you do you will find a rich, deep and detailed game that provides an amazing level of detailed information.  This information will reflect the choices you have made as a franchise owner, both good and bad.  During the season you will use tthis information to help guide you week to week as you prepare to face your next opponent.  During the off-season it will aid you in preparing your team for the upcoming season.  It does have a very good single player capability but the heart of the game can be found in the head to head competition found in multi-player leagues.  Bottom line, the game is worthy of your time.  Many, including myself, are repeat customers that have found themselves faithful players for a decade or more and many new users themselves will be saying the same years from now.			"

												Front Office Football has been on my desktop since the very first version. But, I am not a fan boy. Nothing of it's kind has ever come across my path to supplant it. Those that give it the investment of time, will surely find a rich environment that gives a complete experience of NFL team management. While others can go into specifics and mechanics, and they are both in depth, and challenging, I will just relay that the experience takes you from the micro enjoyment of getting that player in the draft you wanted, or nabbing that under valued free agent who is your missing piece to greatness, to the macro of matching your stats against the greats and seeing years roll by as you create a dynasty, or fall by the wayside. Push button fanatics, will not like this game, and those without the patience to learn it's rhythm really shortchange themselves. But those in the middle, won't be let down. The game allows quick simming most areas, and the seasons can be as short or as long as you wish. Find that sweet spot you enjoy, and it will be there waiting.For instance, I wanted to learn the salary cap, and how to really apply it to real world examples. This game has been the best instructor than any college could provide. Even after 17 plus years of playing this, I still get surprises and enjoyment. It has never left my desktop, and I can say that about no other game.			"

												This is by far the most immersive American Football simulator on any market.  You can take over an existing team, start with a fantasy draft, start with fictional players, or even simulate up to 50 seasons to create a history.  The all-new play designing system allows to you to be as in-depth or as hands-off as you'd like to be.  Whether you decide to call plays in a game, just simulate them, or just watch the plays unfold, FOF8 brings gridiron football through text properly.  There are many good things about this game, and just enough changed from FOF7 to the new version to make it worth an immediate purchase.However, this game lacks any type of in-game editing, so if you are looking for a sandbox experience, this is not the product that offers it.  Always 32 teams, always 2 conferences with 4 divisions, always 6 playoff teams from each conference, and no in-game player editor to be found.  You can edit players previous to starting the game by editing files, but there is no quick and easy way to do so.That being said, this game will provide many, many hours of true football fun to anyone who wants it, and is definitely worth its price tag at sub 30 dollars.

												TL;DR If you know who Aaron Schatz is without having to google it, this could be the best $30 you ever spend.-----I basically gave up playing computer games when I left university 15 years ago. Back then the game was Championship Manager, which I loved. Nonetheless when I found out about this game I have it a try, as I'm really into the NFL, spreadsheets, statistics, Bill Barnwell columns on ESPN, those sorts of things. Since then the amount of hours I've spent immersed in this game is astonishing. Its analytical depth is amazing; the game engine is a masterpiece.Many people will do what I did, which is play the game single-player until it becomes too easy to beat the AI (which took a couple of months of solid play), then graduate to the multi-player scene. I'm in a league called the GML which is great fun. There's a devoted, welcoming community of veterans who have been playing this game for 10 years + and still haven't cracked it fully - they often post useful guidance on the FOFC forum. Any new player looking to improve will find plenty to work with there. It's a steep learning curve, but worth it.If you've got FOF7 the main reasons to migrate to FOF 8 are (1) if you play multi-player, or ever intend to, in which case your league will migrate and (2) if you value the coaching features, such as playbooks and deeper gameplanning, which have been added. The GM side of the game hasn't been updated that much, which is a good thing.			"

												Each edition of Front Office Football brings a new element, and the eighth version offers the deepest, most immersive simulation yet while remaining appealing to novice and veteran users. The biggest addition to FOF8 is the game planning expansion. For the first time in any football sim, users can simulate what it's like to build a game plan just like real NFL coordinators. You can choose packages that fit your personnel as well as build game plans that attack your opponent's weaknesses.The stats and records of FOF8 add another level of immersion, with the ability to track players' progress throughout their careers. The different game levels and ability to assign duties to your coaches allows you to spend as much or as little time playing through a career. Sometimes I want to just play the role of GM, while other times I want to micromanage everything. You can do it all in FOF8.The customer service from Solecismic is personal and amazing. So much of the feedback from fans goes into the game and its updates and future editions. Cannot recommend the game enough if you're a football fan and want a real football sim and not a video game.			"

												Having played countless hours of Front Office Football Seven, I have to say I'm disappointed with this version.The controls are now very kludgey making navigation much more tedious and painful. For example, in Seven, you can easily navigate to your roster from the Draft Preview screen and in Eight, it's a separate view. Another example is when handling free agency, to negotiate a new contract, you have to open the team roster, identify who's due for re-signing then open them up. Then after re-sign, you have to close else the player windows stack up.In season screen, it's no longer obvious how the team is doing on a game by game basis relative to others in the conference. You now have to navigate to another screen to see that.It's just too tedious and frankly, I'm going back to Seven. Had they retained the Seven navigation, I'd be very excited but instead, I'm disappointed.			"

												Ignore previous positive review.  Developer believes Patch notes/Change Log are archaic and no longer necessary.  This tomfoolery has no place in PC Gaming.See https://steamcommunity.com/app/547900/discussions/0/135507403157798555/ xxxxxxxxSee I'm going to recommend this game with a caveat.  This game is not easy to pick up and learn, and the game does itself few favors in that regard.  The developer approaches the Interface in the same utilitarian way that ToadyOne, of DwarfFortress fame, approaches their UI: The UI is a means to display as much information as is possible, not necessarily as efficiently or as beautifully as possible.  But if you can look past the UI issues, you'll find probably the best Gridiron Management game out there.FOF8 has built upon FOF7's solid Owner/GM experience while fleshing out the playcalling and gameplanning for those of us who want to try their hand at coaching.  Now you have the ability to build an offensive playbook each year, filled with up to 200 different plays.  These plays can be made yourself or you can generate a given amount automatically, and each play has it's given style that can synergize with your Off. Coordinator's preferences.  Once plays have been generated in your playbook, you'll need to actually build up a gameplan.  This too can be automated, a feature that you will probably avail yourself of if you're anything like me.  You see, on both sides of the ball you'll need to plug in plays for each possible situation.  1st and 10, 3rd and long, 3rd and One.  Ect.  However the current setup requires you to adjust 1 play at a time.  This adds up to a lot of clicks.  This is by far my biggest gripe in an otherwise fantastic new feature.    Additionally, there are existing limitations to the # of unique plays in the playbook.  On defense it is 12, and on offense it is 50-60, depending on your Offensive Coordinator.  This system makes perfect since and is a fantastic way to add depth to your coaching choices.  However, in addition you are limited to around 80 plays in the gameplan in total.  This makes absolutely no sense, especially on the defensive side of the ball.  Why the hell wouldn't the defense be able to remember the same 12 plays as often as they need to? Unfortunately because I play as a coach first, and a GM second, these issues have entirely ruined my experience.  Forcing myself to run with either a generated playbook that I have no investment in, or a hamstrung playbook that doesn't have the depth I need just makes me want to walk way from the computer.  As such, I've uninstalled the game until the developer can address these issues in the gameplanning system.Final ThoughtsThis game has a lot of progress to go before it's what most would consider 'polished', however it is already the absolute best Gridiron Management game on the market.  If you you are looking for a GM experience, and are ok leaving coaching to the game's AI, I am confident you will find yourself hooked.  However the new features in the coaching realm have hamstrung those of us who prefer to focus as much as possible on the day-to-day running of the team.  That said, the developer's history of releases also all but assures us that he will continue to support his product and address these flaws.			"

It's the only game that when a new one comes out, I will be buying it.With FOF 8 (8th version) you get an endless in depth experience for YOUR franchise or for your General Manager, depending on how you want to play.  You won't find a better football sim anywhere.The new game planning makes me feel more in control, especially of my offense than ever before.For anyone that has taken a liking to the game I would recommend you join a multiplayer league.

												This game is VERY close to being a 'thumbs up', but once you discover what I discovered you'll never want to play the game again which will take you about 18 hours of gameplay to realize.  A complete waste of money.  I played about 10 seasons until I concluded that the stats and results don't matchup with the player and team attributes.  Basically, the engine that simulates game results is severely flawed.  Poorly rated teams and poorly rated players are generating positive results far higher than they should be.  For example, my pathetic team with a rookie QB with a skill rating of 12 (100 being the max) gave my team the best record in the NFL with 11wins/5 losses while the same team with a better QB (35 of 100) just 1 season earlier put me at 5wins/11 losses.  I saw pathetically rated LBs racking up loads of sacks, it just wasn't realistic.  It can simulate an entire season for all teams in less than a minute which means it's NOT using a very complex and detailed algorithm to generate the results.  This is why I'm giving it a thumbs down.  Oh, and the default playbook loves to run the ball on 2nd and longs (ridiculous and a sign of developer incompetence).  You can change the game plan and playbook based on the situation (although quite complex to do), but the broken simulation engine is what ruins the entire thing.			"

												The big problem of the game is the simulative part . You can lose hours building a team , evaluating players and ...you get games that end 55-48 , 62-57 if you run in fast time ...if you actually play the game you feel like you are actually cheated at every play (even in your favor) because the game have to create an ""emotional"" comeback ... and having this in 90% of games is irritating . Also stats are ridicolous ...you have QB that launch 5 intercepts ...or excellent runners that have an average of 2.5 yards all season . You can face great runners that make 3 yds all game or you can have a bad QB that mount a late winning TD on a 4th and 17 ...That things happen in football but not ALWAYS . As results the only acceptable thing are automatic results but then ...why lose hours setting a team when the results can be the product of some cheap calculations ? AlSO that thing of random stats for players generate unplausible things , I really wanted to love it but ...no right now is more frustrating than everything else . Ive won a SB the second season , from under 13 , with a score with 35 seconds to go ..onside recovered and hail mary of 58 yards ...That is acceptable 1 season out of 50 not in almost every game .

												This game an really the whole series have come to dominate my gaming time over the past couple years. It certainly isn't for everyone and the interface can be a bit of a barrier but underneath the hood is a deeply complex and dynamic simulation with no exploits or easy ways to win. You can build solid teams with whatever offensive and defensive focus you want. If you want to be a coordinator on either side of the ball then there is play design and personell packages to allow for extreme specialization i.e. utilizing screen and YAC based receivers along with deep ball specialists, all this means that it isn't just about getting the best players. However if you just want to GM then the AI does a great job of creating gameplans based on your roster and your opponent. Oh, did I mention the draft. Based upon 6 combine scores and the ratings bars there is still a great level of busts and surprises in the other direction. Height, weight and age also play a big role. And all of this is just the single player experience.The real gem of this series are the MP leagues and support. I would gladly pay a subscription fee for each MP league but you don't even have to. If you are a simulation nerd buy the dang game, if you are a true football fan who is sick of Madden exploits then buy the dang game. Take your lumps with the interface and get addicted to SP, after a while get yourself in a MP league (or 4) and you will find that there are no sims (sports or otherwise) that even come close to the challenges presented by FOF. One quick note, the game is published with a help file that is necessary reading and studying material for anyone serious. Along with that there is a great community at http://www.operationsports.com/fofc/forumdisplay.php?f=33 that will help you get up to speed and fill in the intentional gray areas within the help file. As I said, this isn't for everyone but for the right type of customer there is no better gaming experience period.			"

												It may not be the flashiest looking sim you'll ever see, but trust me (and the other reviewers) when I say that this is by far the best football management sim around. It's comprehensive, and has an incredibly realistic game engine. Be patient and you'll be rewarded with the greatest sim to date.			"

												I've been trying to decide how to best review this game for newcomers.  I've finally decided with the following.FOF8 is my first version of this franchise.  I'm a long time gamer, programmer, sports simulation enthusiast, etc.The Good:FOF8 is a pretty darn good game.  It gives you some flexibility in building a team, and managing it.  There's some opportunity to call plays, as well, which can add a layer of depth to the game for some.  The bulk of the game, though, is dealing with your roster and improving your team.Overall, it's what most people want from a sports sim that does not have a graphical component--it's a number-crunching engine, and produces reasonable statistics, for the most part.  The hardest part is managing your salary cap.  The second hardest is managing your injuries.  I found the injuries to be a little to frequent with the default setting, and dialed them back each year until I got to something I thought was about normal.The Bad:Many of these are tiny issues.  There's very little ""flash"" or ""pop"" to the presentation of the game.  It's very similar to looking at a bunch of spreadsheets.  Some of the ""cool factors"" that are added (Green Sheet, Grey Sheet, Scouting Report, etc.) don't feel like they add as much flavor as they could.  Some features aren't properly documented, and some things that feel like they should be no brainers aren't in therePerhaps my biggest beef with the game comes when I'm calling plays.  First, I don't sense much effect with regards to calling plays.  I can call for a deep route on 3rd and 20, or on 2nd and 1, and it feels like defenses cover it the same.Also, it feels as though virtually every 3rd down play is successful.  I had a spell of 8 games where my (undefeated) team only stopped opponents on 8% of their 3rd down attempts.  It didn't matter if it was 3rd and 4, or 3rd and 25, the opponent almost always got 4 yards more than they needed.  Even after drastically improving my defense, this continued (although, the opponents success rate did fall toward, but not into, more normal ranges).  In short, I have the league leading defense in yards per play, yards per run, and yards per pass, but I can't stop a 3rd down, almost ever.I gave up play-calling for that reason.  I strictly manage the team and the rosters now.One other little thing--12 year veteran lineman will try to get you to sign them to 4 year multi-million dollar deals pretty regularly.  I don't know how realistic that is.Finally, if you are in playcalling mode, there's no way to change your personnel packages.  You can't sit your awesome QB in the 4th quarter of a late season game to keep him healthy for the playoffs.  Packages are set from game to game, and I have yet to see a backup get playing time, outside of pre-season.  That makes it pretty hard to nurture your up-and-coming first round QB pick.Otherwise:The game is fun, if not perfect.  There does seem to be tendencies for players to resign with you when they have high loyalty, for example.  Most players want unservicable salaries after a couple of years, and you end up with decisions to make.  Every once in a while you'll find a veteran that's willing to renegotiate to lower your current cap problems, so you can bring in someone new.  Even superstars are hard to trade if they have a big contract.The game doesn't really tell you what you're doing wrong.  It will tell you what positions you need help at, but it's not specific at all.  I had a situation where I had what I thought were good D-linemen, but I was getting killed in the running game.  It would be nice if the assistant coach might say, ""we need some run-stopper linebackers,"" or something to help me figure out, ""oh, I'm getting owned in the gaps.""I hope this was helpful, and I hope you enjoy the game!

												Personally I give this game an 8/10 in terms of how close it comes to what the game sets out to achieve and what I believe most players are expecting. I started playing FoF 7 a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. If there's something I really have to stress to anyone on the fence about buying this game who has never played Front office Football before it's that this game isn't for everyone. This game is for people who are looking for the most in depth football text sim, this game has a steep learning curve, and requires a solid time investment to be successful. For those who already own FOF7 I don't feel like there was enough added to the game to justify buying FOF8 outside of the fact that most MP leagues have moved on to FOF8Some features of the game-Full Multiplayer leagues. In my opinion this is the #1 reason to buy the game. The SP mode can be fun but in any game like this when you learn enough it becomes a little too easy to beat the AI with consistent success. There are several active MP leagues in FOF8 who are regularly changing ownership and accept players of any skill level. Competing against a full league of other owners is a worthy challenge and makes all stages of the game much more interesting. Offense: -Full control of depth chart by formation -Full control of offensive playbook. You can either generate plays tied to your Offensive Coordinator's philosophy, or you can create all your plays yourself. This allows you to create your own route concepts in the passing game. Playbooks can hold up to 200 plays and you can save playbooks if you want to use them season to season-Full control of your weekly offensive gameplan. The amount of plays you can use depends on your OC again and allows you to set which plays you want to be called in which situation. Game planning can be tough but gives the player control over your offensive style. Defense-A wealth of defensive styles available-Weekly game plans allow you to play your defense to your team's strengths-Gives the player control over how often your defense blitzes, plays man / zone, or bump and run coverage. Also has formations that bring the safety into the box for a stronger run defense.Roster Management / Drafting-A fairly complex system where player ratings aren't everything and much like the NFL there are underrated players who find in game success and high rated players who under perform. -Player ratings that are never perfect. The game uses your coaches' scouting ability to determine the ratings you see, a player's true rating can differ fairly significantly from the ratings you see. The more years a player has been in the league the closer your scouted ratings will be to a players true rating.-A draft system that is truly more of an art than a science. You're not going to find your 6th round Tom Brady but for those who are willing to put the time in you can start to identify solid role players deep into the draft. -A contract negotiation system that is tied to player production as well as skill. Unproven players or players who have under performed recently will sign for a discount. Low-average rated players who have impressive seasons statistically will demand more money.-Player hold outs and satisfaction. Some players who feel underpaid will hold out of the preseason for a better contract. Other players may become unhappy due to lack of starting time or because they have a conflict with another player. Unhappy players may refuse to sign with a team altogether.Cons/Criticisms-The UI. Personally I find it manageable / tolerable but I have seen many people complain about the UI over my time on the FOFC forums and feel it should be mentioned that this is something some people really don't care for.-Lack of control in more subtle ways. There's no such thing as a ""zone run"" scheme, no such thing as bringing a 6th OL in as a TE, and no way to put your TE in the slot unless you play him as a slot WR in a certain formation. Also you cannot choose which player will be blitzing from a defensive formation altough you can influence it to more often be your best pass rusher.-The game seems to favor the short passing game / screen game over throwing the ball 10-15 yards down the field. (opinion)-Running backs can get way more touches in a season than would be realistic if they have high enough endurance.			"

												I have played Front Office Football since the original was created years and years ago, and have bought every successive version since.  If you're looking for a hardcore, true-to-life NFL football simulation, you won't find a better game.  There are some other options our there for strategic football simulations, but this is the one I consider the cream of the crop.If you're looking for a simulation of what it really feels like to be an NFL general manager, you have found your game.

												***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.*****You have NO Control over the Defense.**Want to be able to have a say in who blitzes on a play? Find a different game than this one.Want to be able to tell your Nickel or Dime Backs to play in Man or Zone? Find a different game than this one.Want to be able to stay in base D when the other teams brings out 3 WRs? Find a different game than this one.Want to be in Nickel or Dime when other team only has 2 WRs in the formation, like for 3rd & Long situations? Find a different game than this one.Great idea that continues to be executed weaker and weaker in recent releases. Been buying this game since before EA was in charge for a bit around 99 to 02. The best version of this game was either FOF 2004 or 2007. This is the most confusing and unhelpful UI ever released by Jim. Also, if you don't have some Windows Visual Performance settings set a certain way, windows appear bugged until you alt-tab and come back or go to the desktop and come back.*Note: Some windows do not appear or function at all.*I can't recommend this game to anyone at this time.

												I like management games and I looked forward to Front Office Football 8 being realised so i could buy it. It got released and I bought it. 15 minutes in I realised what a mistake I made. Its horrible. But i carried on hoping that I would find what these positive reviews were telling me was so good about it. 4 hours of gameplay in and Ive given up. Its the worst game I have ever come across and I used to own a Vic-20.  I'll never play it again and never again will I buy a game off Steam that doesnt have a demo.   Front Office Football 8 is the biggest waste of 3 hours wages before tax that I have ever spent. I only wish I bought 4 pints of cider instead of buying this game.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I've owned every version for the last dozen years or so. But I don't play FOF to be the headcoach. I play to be the GM. The playbook aspect has ruined my multiplayer experience to the point I'm likely going to drop out of my league.This version just isn't right for me.			"

												Would be kinda fun if the UI wasn't crap and the player ranking wasn't junk.To give you an idea of how bad the player rankings are, in the game I started, the top 5 QBs in the league were in order: Andy Dalton, Tom Brady, Blake Bortles, Jay Cutler, Matt Stafford.Players like Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, and Eli Manning were somwhere near the middle with Josh McCown and Fitzpatrick.The game randomizes players attributes, thus giving some mediocre starters elite skills while killing some very good players skills and making them mediocre.The UI's problem is that everything has a weird name.  Want to see your Depth Chart, yeah that's called Offensive/Defensive Staff.  Along with that confusion is the help system, which doesn't explain anything other than definitions of words.  I wanted to know how to sign players in Free Agency since no players show up in my free agency window, so I looked up Free Agency in the help, all it told me was how to open the free agent window and that free agency is where I could sign players.You can edit the rosters in a very time consuming manner of exporting the player file, opening it up in Excel, editing players, then starting a new game using the edited player file.  And you can spend many hours trying to figure out the frustrating layout of the UI.  I can not recommend this game, because of these flaws it makes it a lot of work and not much fun.			"

												After a great game in FOF 7, one which I have logged hundreds of hours, this is a very disappointing release.  It comes across as an unfinished or rushed project.  The offensive side of the game is very strong, the game has progressed in a number of ways.  However defensively the game is very lacking.  The game has a massive amount of potential, but at this point it simply isn't a well rounded simulation.EDITED - Recent patches have now improved the game vastly.  It is a worthy successor to FOF 7 now, an improved version.  Highly recommended.			"
