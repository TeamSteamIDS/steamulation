Early Access Review
								Hey! I am a member of TEAM ROCKETS so my review would be biased and terrible for you. But we would like to hear your feedback; we check the steam forums many times a day!But if you want to know what I really think about ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS, let's get *serious* for a moment.I've been a game developer for many years. A lot of times you work on an exciting idea that seems like it might work, and a lot of times you work on things just out of momentum, and sometimes you wake up and discover you're working on something you should have cancelled months ago. It's sorta the way life goes, as a developer; it's hard to objectively see what you are working on as anything but ""good."" A lot of the time it's hard to even find playtesters to help you out.Sometimes, though - rarely - an idea comes along that hits you like falling in love does. You jump out of bed every day to work on it. You can't stop thinking about it. The whole world gets more vibrant, and you see your idea everywhere. Everyone you show the early prototypes to instantly get it and also fall in love. You start gaining fans and all you have is a title screen or a doodle on a napkin... And they aren't friends or family. This kind of experience is incredibly rare, and I am stupendously honoured to be feeling it for ROCKETS right now.I know I'm in the thick of it right now, and I still have those rose-colored glasses on, but I think I will fondly look back on ROCKETS for the rest of my life. It may not be my best technical work, it may be unfinished right now, and it may not become a commercial success (I'm writing this before the Early Access launch!), but by golly does this game feel right in every way.It feels incredible to build, it feels incredible to play, and it feels incredible to be a part of this talented team.I hope you'll fall in love with the game like I did.

								ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is exactly what the title implies. You fly around in a rocket and prove to others who is the studliest of all the rockets. Here's a Quick Look video if you want to see how this game plays. There's also my review below if you simply want a more in-depth and concise look at the game. 


YouTube™ Video: ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS Quick Look 

			Views: 3,251		

			Watch Noble of Lost Pause take a quick look at ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS. As you may have suspected, it's about rockets. But not just any rockets. Dogfighting rockets!		

Let me start my review by saying this game is extremely bare at this point. It only has local dogfighting between 2 rockets, 2 v 1 underdog mode, or team deathmatch. But damn is the dogfighting good. You get three different ways to attack: by shooting lasers that go straight ahead, dropping bombs that fling out your side and are effected by gravity, and finally mines that shoot out your backside and blow up behind you. Simple right? But try throwing that in with high-speed rocket action. Suddenly you have to plan your shots to cut off the path your enemy is flying. Did the enemy drop a mine? Knock it right back at him with a laser and laugh in his face. Wanna rain death on a pursuer? Fling bombs into the sky and try to weave away from the hail of death. It's simply fun experimenting and trying to become the best pilot. And trust me, you'll always know who is the better pilot. You simply can't win the game based solely on luck. You have to dominate your opponent with the tag system they implemented. Basically put, both sides start from scratch, and if you hit the enemy 3 times in a row, it's your win. But if he hits you once, he'll knock a tag off your streak that you'll have to make up for until you fill the gauge in the top of the screen. This means games can end quickly, or be an intense test of endurance between two evenly-matched pilots.Another great point of this game is the visuals. I love painting the cosmos with my vapor trails. Not only does it enhance the sense of speed you're getting, but it also tells the tale of the dance of death the rockets have been through. And when I say dance, I mean it. The music in this game is super catchy, too.But let's discuss some negatives now. Just keep in mind that his is Early Access, and most of this will probably get changed in future patches.*The game is super short in its current state (you do everything there is to do once you play your first match). It's just dogfighting. And while it's good, it might not be enough to sell it at this point for some people.*There is no progression or anything to unlock. Something that'll keep the player coming back for more is always knowing they'll get rewarded if they play more.*All the rockets are the same, just colored differently. I'd like to have different looking rockets just for cosmetic purposes at least. Just something to make me feel unique.*No upgrades to weapons. I'm not talking flat out upgrades that are better than another, but more of something that makes them act differently. Like a laser that fires faster but has limited range. Or a mine that explodes in a larger radius but you can't shoot out as many. Just something to make this game more strategic and diverse would be good.*No online. This will be fixed later, but it'll remain a negative until it's implemented.*No tutorial. Sure it's fun flying around and getting absolutely owned by the AI for the first few times, but some sort of menu to list the controls would be nice.*No options menu. You can't change the sound effects, resolution, or anything else ingame currently.Now while that may be a lot of negatives, most--if not all--of those while be ironed out in the future. So wait until then if they bother you.So to wrap this up, this game is going to bud into something very good. And for the low cost of $5 they're handing it out for currently, it certainly worth picking it up even now.*As a side note, I will (hopefully) update this review as major patches are released or just do it again once it's finally released. Just yell at me and I'll come running to take another look if I forget.*			"

												Update: 14 months after ""full"" release the developers updated the game, removing/adding the missing ""coming soon"" content and fixed the resolution bug.Original: This is an unfinished game that is *not* labeled early access. Despite the game being fully released, many menu items say ""coming soon"" but the developers seem to no longer be updating the game.


When is soon?

												I am deeply sadden by this game, because I have never seen such a great potential for a game to be something amazing that was never achieved. Rockets does something that few other games do, it takes a concept, simplifies it, and then perfects it. When you play this game, you find yourself in one of the best feeling, looking, and joy filling games you will ever play, so why is it bad? This game may have some of the best combat you will ever experience, but you can do nothing with it. Imagine Rockets like an towering skyscraper, it is jaw dropping, beautiful, and unbreakable. So what is the problem with the building? Well the thing is empty! There is no furniture, no colors, no substance. They have laid the ground work for one of the biggest games we could ever see, but they have left their foundation completely empty. There is two game modes, (Both of which are just the basic battle with different health systems.) one AI, four maps, and thats really it, where as what the game doesn't have is more customization, more single player ability, and ONLINE! Why would you not give this game online, that just doesn't make sense! I hate to see such an amazing game go down in history as just another indie game, just because it didn't give people enough to talk about, but here it is, and here is will stay. The perfect recipe for something amazing that they just didn't take the time to make into a dish.			"

Early Access Review
It's on sale! Do not hesitate, just buy!Read the tl;dr section if you want at the bottom(too long; didn't read)Better ViewReview will be updated periodically. [Last Update: 21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014]I discuss: What is R3, the gameplay, music, and even the developer for those of you who are worried about Early Access. ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS. I haven't had more fun with a game in awhile, and I have a lot of games. However, I will not make this review solely based on praising the game, but to get a better idea of what the gameplay is like I will explain all the core mechanics and aspects of the game. Pictures will not help you, you must try this out for yourself.What is ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS?R3 is a rocket flying arcade shooter, where you shoot rockets at other rockets. Currently there is one single gamemode with local only, but don't let this dissapoint you. All my hours are with its smart 1v1 AI that faces a huge challenge at first. Games can go either way everytime. R3 relies on quick twitch mechanics with its easier to learn gameplay and controls. The learning curve flows very nicely where you will be able to play decently after a couple of hours, but you will always get better. You have three weapons.Standard Rockets(You will use this most of the time.)Drop Rockets(These are advanced and even I have trouble using them. Many people accidentally hit themselves with it. It takes practice.)- They drop using physics, so based off your momentum and gravity,the rockets will drop different ways. Usually you want to use this when the enemy is far below you.Mine(Static mine that pops out behind you.)The neat part about R3 is its controls. They aren't relative. Up goes upward, right goes right, etc. This means you have true freedom in how you move. You can pull of neat turns and dodge obstacles at fast speeds. Hitting someone can be sometimes very difficult. You have a shield that you activate with a button, it only comes on for about a second and will promptly dissapear. Rockets can't get through your shield but mines can. This helps prevent your uninvitable doom when faced with a barrage of rockets that you realize you can not dodge. It also gives you a little boost, and has a cooldown, so you better be careful when using it.The standard gamemode is an advantage system. Whoever has a +3 advantage in hits wins. Your opponent has 2 points and you hit them. They now have 1 point and you still have 0. When they are back at 0 you can now score. This gamemode influences long high octane battles, however if this sounds off to you still consider getting it as the developer plans to add more gamemodes.Now what about the Developer!?The lead Developer Andy Moore is probably one of the best Early Access indie devs I've seen that not only is commited to adding lots of content, but making sure everyone has an enjoyable experience. Don't be afraid that this game will not work for you, he always puts out experimental builds that you can opt into to try and listens to every complaint you have.He's not the type of developer that goes, ""I like feedback, but I'm not going to actually use said feedback"". He updates in a regular and timely manner and is always in the discussions on the forum.So don't be afraid to put your money into this project. Infact I encourage you because the price will get higher upon release. Yes, this does seem off putting to a lot of you. However, the game is fairly polished and always recieving updates. They have plans for after release also. No, this won't end up being $60(DayZ... really?). My guess is $10 - $15.Hot JamsThe music in this game is absolutely wonderful. It's composed by Power Up Audio, who did the music for Towerfall: Ascension and many others. Check them out! It features upbeat electro space jams. You can listen to it all day. I swear. It currently only includes 4 tracks. Menu theme and two in-game themes and a 2 part win theme. All are good and mastered well. They are adding in more music, but you can tell by the quality that they put effort into it.What's not good about R3- Currently it has a limited options menu(which will be improved soon.)- It needs a bit more polish on the UI, it's very clean and neat however it's missing a good amount of stuff.- The game is in Early Access so AI is only complete for 1v1, but they are now testing multi AI currently so I wouldn't worry about it. Honestly, the game is best for 1v1. You will probably most likely play 1v1. Any higher is for more advanced players. Alright, I can't think of anymore problems.Will this game support my controller and keyboard!?Most likely: Yes. Literally every recent update he has added support for a bunch of random controllers I've never even heard off. Keyboard controls are good at the moment, but are always getting better. What should I be warned about before buying?It's Alpha mate. Things change.What I'm worried about in the FutureMultiplayer NetccodeThis game features a lot of collision and player interaction which is why it must have a good netcode. Netcode is the reason I haven't purchased Brawlhalla. I do expect on Multiplayer release the netcode to be very shoddy, however I hope the developers will work very hard on it, and based on my comment on the dev,  I'm sure he will.I hope this doesn't require any of our own servers like many indie games have been doing lately. A Peer-to-peer lobby or universal servers will be better.What I need you to do.Buy this game. It won't be good without players. Don't hold off and get it. $5, and you're getting it at a cheaper price than release also. Hate the idea of paying developers for alpha testing? Remember when games didn't tell you they were incomplete till you bought them? You're supporting development and helping this game get out there and faster. By buying in you allow them to afford a multitude of things that will go back into the game. Servers, advertisement, features, music. Just do it.In current development I give R3 a: 7/10 Unique!Gameplay and Controls: 10 Best!Settings and UI: 5/10 AverageAnd I don't do that BS where 7 is average. 5 is average on my scale. Have fun Rocketeers!tl;dr+ Well polished.+ Frequent Updates+ Dedicated Devloper who releases Expiremental builds to ensure all users are having fun. Have a problem? Just post in the forum, a build will be out in seconds!+ Hot Jams+ Great Controls and pacing+ Support for everything+ Learning Curve+ Button Mashing is actually fun?- Limited Setting(at the moment!)- Missing a couple of in-game UI elements- Only two modes avaliable-------12:30 AM(EST) May 18th, 2014-------Andy is allowing the community to edit the level generation, controls, physics, and more with a new file. We're all testing different outcomes of how we believe R3 should play like.-------21:27 PM(EST) June 18th, 2014-------So R3 Module One update hit for all users not in the Experimental build a few days ago. After getting my testing in the amount of stuff added is great. NA new challenge mode has been added with leaderboards and a couple of new styles for everything. Also more hot jams!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very fun.. once you know the controls. At first I was very confused with how I controlled my rocket, thinking it was relative, but then I realized the up arrow goes up, down arrow goes down, left goes left, and right goes right. Okay, I had that figured out, but then I needed to figure out how to shoot. Space? No. Shift? No, that's a weird shield thing. Control? Nope. X? Nah. Z? Nope! D? Ah, that shoots rockets. I then started pressing WASD to see what it would do. A shoots smaller rockets, and S drops bombs. Also, my resolution is stuck at 800x600, for some reason. This game needs an options menu, or even just a seperate executable to change the resolution. For positive, well, the music is amazing!! This game is also very beautiful, and fast paced. It has a feel to it... It's great. And the light trails, wow. The AI is very smart, also. Still haven't won a battle.Anyway, this is a great game, and has a lot of potential for future multiplayer, but I feel it needs a tutorial and some options.Pick it up, though, it's worth it!EDIT: It seems the developer added some settings! That's great, he even added a controls page. I'm loving the game and it fixed most of its problems! I know that this game will be also very good for the keyboard in the future, because right now it seems the developer still seems uncertain about the current controls. Hoping for the best! Again, it's a great game, worth the money, pick it up!			"

												ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is hands down the most entertaining way to get carpal tunnel playing couch co-op. It has beautiful aesthetics and is quite enjoyable to play with a friend, against the AI, or even in the more pacifist Zen mode flying around and making art with rocket trails. The combat is simple, intuitive, and amazing, with three projectiles and a dash maneuver which allow for diverse gameplay. You can shoot missles, leave nasty mines, and drop bombs to cause beautiful, beautiful havoc. I'm not kidding. It's quite beautiful watching the brightly colored projectiles and stages blossom with bright, cheerful explosions as your enemies spin, hit by your barrage of missles and bombs or blasted by a mine. There is a lot of potential for skill, but even beginners can play without too much barrier.Pros:Fun gameplayBeautiful (minimalist) graphicsGreat game modesCouch versus, co-op vs bots, and Zen modeCons:High risk of intense button mashing, play at your own risk.No online multiplayer (and, given the intense speed of matches, it makes sense, though it would be amazing if it existed)Basically requires a controller- playable on keyboard and mouse, but much less fun.I highly recommend this game if you have a friend nearby or just want to relax and unwind against a bot or in Zen mode.

												Ill be honest, I bought this game with the intent to try it out and then return it. What i experienced when i booted up that first game instantly changed that. This is a phenominally simple game, but it is SO MUCH FUN. Pros:Killer Soundtrack.Simplistic and beautiful.Easy to grasp controls.Amazing game for couch co-op or multiplayer.Intense Dogfights. Like Intense!Incredibly Fun! Cons:There isnt a whole lot of variety, theres one level and one mode(with the addition of a ""Zen"" aka drawing mode and a tournament mode, that facillitates that play style but isnt a unique gmae mode)Nothing to spice up the level, yeah the slow down and speed up drops are cool, but they dont change the game in anyway, just make it slower or faster. I'd like to see some special one use weapons or shields drop occasionally.In my opinion, the camera comes in close to quickly, its a bit jarring durin the fight and distracting.Overal, It impressed me enough that Radial Games can keep my money. Definitely a great game to play with friends.TL;DR Great Game, Great soundtrack. Little lacking on Content.  7/10 Buy this game. "

MUSICMUSICMUSICHeed the suggestion upon launch—play this game with a controller. You will not have a good time playing this with a keyboard.The gameplay is really repetitive—even playing with friends gets tedious. This isn't helped by the fact that the maps don't offer any variety. However, the thing that's keeping me from giving the game a thumbs down is the stunning neon art and effects, sound production, and best of all—the soundtrack. Kudos to Ben Lam for making great music! I wish you could just grab the soundtrack but I'd say the $10 deluxe edition is worth it just for the music alone.6/10			"

Early Access Review
								I mainly bought this game because I was a fan of the game 3918 (Humble Bundle Mojam 2). Albeit awesome controls in 3918, ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS does not have the same/similar controls. In 3918 your mouse would control your rocket. The further your mouse got from the rocket, the more acceleration would be used. Controls:I am not all together disappointed with the controls of RRR, and I'm willing to take a learning curve. The game is quite bare at the moment, though I can't really complain, because It's Early Access, and I'm sure the Devs will make various revisions to the current game's state, to boot I did only pay about $2.50 a copy realistically. I'm excited to see where the game goes, and possible revisions to the mouse and keyboard controls as I do not own a controller, which is the currently recommended by RRR.Weapons/Bombs/Physics/Etc:Not disappointed at all, Physics/reactions to being hit are appropriate, music/sound affects are good.It's Early Access so take it with a grain of salt, I don't know how often the Devs intend on pushing out updates, but for the current price and the hope of future revisions and addons to it's current state, ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is well worth $5.

												A waste of money, it's a great game per se but after ten minutes you find it so repetitive, also there was a promised multiplayer, but THEY DIDN'T SAY that it was LOCAL multiplayer until they released it.Pros: -Lovely Graphics-Lovely Physics-Decent AICons:-Repetitive-Too expensive for what it is-I bought it before they said the multiplayer was just LocalIf you find it with a big discount like -70% I would recommend it "

Early Access Review
								EDIT :   Changed from negative to positive on 3/1/2015.  Dev replied.   The devs are listening and are working on the game in a positive way, so im sure that it is headed in a good direction.  The regular game is still a thumbs down, for now, but most of my issues with it have been addressed in the beta version.  The beta version is playable for me with bloom turned off but imo its just not the same without it.Changes included in beta version detailed at the bottom. .............................................................................................................................................................RECCOMENDATION :  YES : I would wholeheartedly reccommend this game a few months ago, but not anymore.   I am writing this review with the hopes of getting the devs attentions, youve made an amazing game and I want to point out some things so that i can play it again.  I completely reccommend this game at 5$, but only after below said issues are fixed.   Review will be updated as changes happen.     Sound: 8/10Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Bloom: 2/10Controls: 6/10OVERALL: 6/10 for now...............................................................................................................................................................GAMEPLAY :  Rocketsx3 is a great PvP multiplayer game. Can be played against bots as well.  You can play upto 4 player but the experience is best with 2. You could play 4 on a TV pretty well.   You control a ship and you have 3 weapons.  Mines, missiles, and  bombs.  Each of these attacks can be fired one at a time, or charged and released to dish out a devastating barrage of your weapon of choice.    Mines launch behind you and detonate in an area after a while.  Missiles launch directly in front of you and shoot forward.     Bombs are like tiny missiles but have no thrust, so they fall off from the side of your rocket.You get a sheild that also functions as a speed boost, allowing you to block attacks or get out of a tight situation.  First to 3 hits in a row wins! You can hit yourself and that deducts from your score.   Controlling your ship may be hard at first but youll get the hang of it.  Gameplay is fast, solid, and fluid.  Matches are usually short but may last longer. And boy are those longer matches tense.   Dodging missiles, falling for mine traps, using bombs to block your escape, a well timed charge attack to get two hits in a row or that moment when you engage eachother in a tense spiral of death.     Graphics are great, a very beautiful and neon art style, and the announcer ingame is great. A female, robotic assistant type voice.  The AI is amazing and WILL beat you many times. ................................................................................................................................................................COMPLAINTS :  I used to love this game. I played it  everyday with a good friend of mine. Both of us have stopped playing this game now due to changes made to it over successive updates that has left the game unplayable for us.  These reasons are :  1) WAY too bright. The brightness of the ship burner and particles, as well as environment objects and trails was multiplied by 20.   There should be a slider for this.  I miss the darkened out trails that the game had in the beginning, the bright trails before the christmas update were fine too, but it became WAY too sparkly after that. no reason that this cant be optional.   2) Difficult to fight in tight spaces now.  Due to the changes to particles and brightness, when you clash with eachother in tight corners or against walls, you cant tell what is going on.   3) Unncessary clutter added.  Your health is depicted by 3 balls around your ship. I feel that this adds unncessary clutter to the game and takes away from your focus.  I prefer the healthbar at the top. No reason why this cant be an option.  4) Screen size  : I play this game on my 21 inch 1980x1080 desktop, where the game is just about playable in its current state.   On my  1366x768 laptop though, i cant see anything anymore.    5) The background was darkened out to try and fix the visibility issue i reckon,  and it looks plain terrible.  6) The pulsating rocket trail. Please no.    7) The last life slowdown. Let this be an option. It takes away from the fast paced fun of the game for me.. Totally kills the mood, although it is cool sometimes.  Could be an optional powerup or 5th button.  ..............................................................................................................................................................CONCLUSION : Options are your best friend. Please dont just remove something and replace it with something else entirely.   Some poeple prefer one thing over another.  Online play will be coming to this game later on im sure.  On a positive note the UI work is great. Always improving. The music score is also nice.There is no problem in the gameplay , but how the game is visually presented has totally gimped it for me and made it unplayable. If you could provide me with an older build of this game, I'd much rather play that than what is on the steam store right now.   I dont have any reviews on my account, but i care enough about this game to write this out.  Your feedback on this review would be much appreciated.  Heres hoping a dev replies or these issues are addressed.       ................................................................................................................................................................EDIT :     CHANGES IN THE BETA VERSION OF THE GAME :   The beta build of the game includes a lot of improvements, which are :  1)   A bloom and rocket trail slider.  The lowest setting in bloom is still too high for me, its the same as the regular game.  The bloom slider is overkill. http://i.imgur.com/IyQAukE.gifv2) Tug of war is back!  But if you prefer the health bubbles, you now have bubble size, rotation speed, and distance from ship.  3) An option to enable/disable speedup/slowdown  pickups.  Though there is a bug that the pickups still appear in game, they just dont do anything. Other misc things  and comments :   I still find the game more difficult to play than pre christmas update. Colors are brighter? The particles? I cant pin it down for sure without playing an old build again but here are my comments :  The pulsating rocket trail and environment objects distracts me.  Also, i still prefer the discolored rocket trails.   The speed boost sparks are something id want to turn off too.   In the tug of war end game timer, white on white is too difficult to see.  Its hard to tell how much time you have left, please change that.    No 1980x1080 resolution in the beta build, but thats a minor gripe. A new gameplay feature i noticed that i DID like, is that you can now visibly see when a rocket is charging an attack. Awesome.  But instead of the white lines that indicate this, a colored outerglow or border so that its easier to see?    Progress is going well, i look forward to it.			"

								FANTASTICLY ENTERTAINING! A bit ""bare"" at the moment, but lots of fun still! Only difficulty i encountered during play was the fact that when I connected my controller before starting the game, I got automatically set up against the computer. But when I connected it during play the 2-player mode was activated. A bit complicated, but we worked it out! Looking forward to the updates :)			"

Early Access Review
								Very early access game right now; super barebones. However, lots of fun to be ad here with the insanely difficult AI, and when online MP is introduced, it is sure to be a blast.Update from Early Access:Gameplay here is still rock solid. The online modes look to be alot of fun, and so far the game has only improved gameplay wise.Visually, however; not so much.Menus have gone from the sleek, minimalist approach from Early Access to cluttered, dare I say ""ugly"" designs. While functional, it looks more like a Flash game from the 00's rather than a fast and furious arcade shmup. This transition is applied in game as well; previously a nice, solid background with vibrant solid colored walls gave the game a minimalistic yet attractive view in game. It made seeing you're rockets and missles alot easier. However, it has since been replaced by a black on blue background filled with squares; while some might find this look to be great, it looks ""unprofessional"" for lack of a better term, once again losing the charm that had hooked myself and others originally.At the current state the game is fun to play, but the stark contrast between 6 months ago and now has left the game looking worse off. This does not mean it IS worse off; real beuaty is on the inside (Gameplay), but the outside layer on this game has turned myself and several other friends who I convinced to buy this title in Early Access off for the time being.

								ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is a game about firing rockets at other rockets and occasionally you will need to fire rockets at rockets that the enemy rocket has fired. confused. Imagine ballet with rockets and mines and drop rockets. you see a swarm of rockets coming towards you so you dodge and then spin and you leave niffty trails behind you and all together make a really nice piece of art while firing rockets at another rocket. This game is cheap and worth the money. Dont buy a real rocket they are just money grabs and are overrated.			"

It is just plain fun! I am not too good at it, but that doesn't stop me from choosing to play.Pros:Pretty visualsAMAZING musicEnjoyable gameplayCons:Weird controlsOnly so much you can do without friendsOverall, I'd give this game a 6/10.

								PLEASE READ THE EDIT BELOWKeyboard controls in Module 3♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.I have no controller that I can use on this game, so I used the keyboard in module 2. Which, although hard to find, were easy to use after very little playing. With Module 3, they made the game much more flashier and amazing, which I enjoy for the most part. However, the new keyboard controls are ridiculous, especially if you played often in Module 2. They migrated the movement keys from WASD to the arrow keys, so now I have to use my left hand for movement instead of shooting, and vice versa. The new shooting controls were swapped entirely, which pisses me off even further.So, for Module 2, 9/10.For Module 3, 5/10. Do not recommend the current version. Play module 2 instead if its possible.EDIT: I apologize, the game elements I had mentioned early have now been fixed. It is now possible to edit your controls in Module 3. Because of this, I give this game 9/10. This is a great game, and definitely deserves more attention than it currently does.			"

								In my view, the best indie game I've ever played so far.It's a simple game where ROCKETS shoot several explosives at other ROCKETS.Yet it's energetic and how the beats fit to the awesome music is just gorgeous.I always get pumped up by playing this.You can play alone with the AI or with friends in local multiplayer.The AI is also pretty good and merciless. You may lose a lot in your first tries.It's recommended to play with a controller. Your hands may hurt after playing a few rounds with the keyboard.The game is still under development:  Full 4 player support and online mode are coming soon. (Keep in mind that online mode is not 100% comfirmed yet and may not be in the final game. But it will, most likely.)The development is slow, but it's understandable since it's a small team.You can also go to the ""experimental"" stage by selecting Betas in the Properties from the Steam Libray to jump straight into the development and test the new features before they are officialy released.I totally recommend this game to everyone! Just give it a try.			"

I totally recommend this and I can't wait for future updated with promised features, game is great even unfinished and worth the few bucks! Textual review, if for some reason you don't like videos:Pros: Beautiful visuals, great electronic music, colours, challenging, simple yet addictiveCons: Someone might find the AI too hard (but I enjoyed it since I like challenge), early access (but worth it anyway)This game is about rockets shooting rockets at rockets. Do not expect tanks or helicopters, all you get is in the title it self and the developers have more nice plans for this game in the future. For example coop, a function I personally cannot wait for and I'm so excited for the moment I will be able to play it with my friends! Otherwise you get presented with a stunning visual execution, great fitting music and vibrant challenging gameplay. I certainly hope that this game will not get forgotten, because it's the first early access game that did not disappoint me at the start.This review will get updated as the game will.- Playintosh, out  "

At first I didn't know what was going on! This makes hits and kills feel that much more awesome. The music is extraordinarily well done and really gives that final touch to the game. The graphics are basic, but still beautifly produced. The gameplay is also great, but I don't think this game works very well with a keyboard and mouse. I did find one glitch which was after I finally beat my cpu opponent, the music in-game stopped. Of course, the game is still in development, so I don't want to concentrate on glitches and lack of content.So far, the game looks good, the music is wonderful and overall, it's fun to play!			"

								Fantastic game. Low playtime so far but everytime I play with friends it's a blast and I don't see it getting old anytime soon. If you have the controllers to play with, this is a great pick and the perfect price for a solid local mp game with depth and strategy that you can play for hours. I've only played 1v1 and singleplayer so far and the AI is extremely challenging, but very fair. 1v1, however, is where it gets interesting...			"

Extremely bare-bones at the moment (5/3/2014) but with the limited amount of usability i STILL find this game very fun!  Game's designed to hop right in and get started immediately.  Only problems i have so far are no options menu and no controls explained at all.  Googled and couldn't even find anything.  That's just nitpicking though, can't wait to see the future features.Edit 5/9/2014 : It's been a year and the game is very different from what it was.  Much more optimized and graphically is drastically better.  It's very playable as is, but lack of online is still a bummer.  From what I can gather they are going to implement online multiplayer in the future.  If they do than not buying this would be a mistake.			"

								Surprisingly, while most of the optional features are missing (including a working options menu, not too big of a problem at this point) the core gameplay and look of the game is quite solid.  The input could use a little more fine tuning to increase the response time and precision, but it's mostly reliable, certainly better than a lot of games.The big problems at the moment are that the control scheme isn't explained, and while the keyboard controls are functional, they are a bit awkward (which they acknowledge).  Also, it crashes with two players and two bots (as of 5/9/14).However, even if you don't want to get this game now (which, for 5 bucks isn't much of a risk) keep it on your radar.  The gameplay is much more nuanced than expected.  The three different weapons don't fire in a set arc for damage, they react with physics in a fashion that adds both a layer of unpredictablility and extra utility.  For example, while you can shield a straight rocket, you can also fire more rockets at it to deflect it.  Those could then fire off in some unpredicted direction and hit another player.  Is your opponent dropping mines?  Fire a missle at the mine and bounce it in to him.  Things like that.  Straight forward, but nuanced.A dogfight match can last anywhere between 10 seconds and 10 minutes depending on how well matched the players are, or how poorly they make decisions.  It is also quite good as a compettitive game.  Though chaotic looking, it's chaotic in the way Super Smash Bros is chaotic.  A lot is going on, but everything is based on a cause and effect system.So if you're looking for a good local co-op game, this is one.  Online multiplayer is planned, but currently (5/9/14) unavailable.  If you prefer to play it in a more complete form, put it on your wishlist.  It is very promising, and for me, already worth a buy.			"

								Pay little attention to the amount of time I have played this game. I can tell that RRR is going to be a great, if not classic, arcade-style game. IMO, it's worth the $4.99. Sadly, I don't own a gamepad. The keyboard controls are not reccomended, but that's ok! The keyboard still works and this game is still fun. The game's idea is simple, but currently it is a bit off. I still don't know what the heck is going on when I start up a match; this can be easily solved, and I'll let it slide to the alpha-state of the game.I recommend this game if you, the person reading this review, is interested in fun, fast paced, arcade-style games.Have fun shooting rockets at rockets!

								This is certainly a very interesting and intense game. You have to use a balance of both tactics and bruit force to win, and if you think you can just spam attack, then think again, the game will punish you by your own missiles. They are very happy to blow up the first thing they touch, weather it be friend or foe. The tug of war like scoring mechanism makes it very easy for the tables to be turned. You can be winning one minute, and totally owned the next. The last chance timer forces you to fight to your death when you're on your last legs, knowing that if the timer runs out, or, if you take one more hit, you will lose.I will have to say that this is a very well thought out and visually stunning 2D dog fighting game, and even in its early Access stage, it is well worth the £3.99, or even better; £10.99 to pick up 3 other copies for your friends, that will bring you hours of fun when the multiplayer is added.

												No online multiplayer yet, but still great fun against the computer (and local multiplayer) in the meantime. I didn't expect the dogfighting to be so intense and fun. Been having fun mopping the floor with the enemy (and with some tinkering, a trio of them, and still mauling them).Online Mode is going to be mayhem whenever it's released/possible; moreso when workshop is integrated for all kinds of modes in the long-run alongside it. Definitely worth it for the updates down the line; and even in it's current form.Combat tip:Don't depend too much on thrust, and keep your trajectories relative to the combat at hand. Trust me on this. For those of you that have played Starcon 2: The Ur-Quan Masters, you know what I'm talking about.			"

								This is going to be good.Right now ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is a brilliant little game and well worth the £4 price, when the extra features are added this will be utterly sublime.The flight feels similar to Luftrausers, but with ROCKETS, and is therefore instantly better.With the current AI you can play 1V1 1V2 2V2 or 1V3, all of which are very enjoyable.My main critism is that the AI are really good, and it would be nice to have the option to tone them down,  but only slightly.When I first started playing the game felt hectic and utterly skillless. But after giving it a bit more time I can actually see this being a bloody marvelous competition game if two competent players were competing completely.The scoring system is a tug of war affair, where every hit brings you closer to winning, however being hit pulls the score back from your end and closer to the enemy's victory which can result theoretically in unlimitely long battles presuming both players are decent.

								Pay little attention to the amount of time I have played this game. I can tell that RRR is going to be a great, if not classic, arcade-style game. IMO, it's worth the $4.99. Sadly, I don't own a gamepad. The keyboard controls are not reccomended, but that's ok! The keyboard still works and this game is still fun. The game's idea is simple, but currently it is a bit off. I still don't know what the heck is going on when I start up a match; this can be easily solved, and I'll let it slide to the alpha-state of the game.I recommend this game if you, the person reading this review, is interested in fun, fast paced, arcade-style games.Have fun shooting rockets at rockets!

								This is going to be good.Right now ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is a brilliant little game and well worth the £4 price, when the extra features are added this will be utterly sublime.The flight feels similar to Luftrausers, but with ROCKETS, and is therefore instantly better.With the current AI you can play 1V1 1V2 2V2 or 1V3, all of which are very enjoyable.My main critism is that the AI are really good, and it would be nice to have the option to tone them down,  but only slightly.When I first started playing the game felt hectic and utterly skillless. But after giving it a bit more time I can actually see this being a bloody marvelous competition game if two competent players were competing completely.The scoring system is a tug of war affair, where every hit brings you closer to winning, however being hit pulls the score back from your end and closer to the enemy's victory which can result theoretically in unlimitely long battles presuming both players are decent.

								I know it's always best to wait until a product is into it's full release before judging it, but this game is just so much fun to play! There are only two modes available at the moment, but even just the regular dogfighting game mode is extremely entertaining! The controls were difficult to learn with the keyboard, unfortunately, as they aren't actually labelled anywhere. They only give you the controls for a controller, which was especially frustrating because I had to press every button on the keyboard to figure out what did what while trying to evade the AI rocket. I also can't find any way to play underdog mode or team play. I can't wait for online play, campaign, and co-op!+Super fun and entertaining+Very fast-paced, hectic, and frenzied+Button mashing works!(just don't hit yourself with the bombs)+Local competitive+Beautiful-UI was quite confusing when using a keyboard-Haven't yet found a way to play underdog mode or team play-Only two modesCan't wait for the upcoming updates!

												No online multiplayer yet, but still great fun against the computer (and local multiplayer) in the meantime. I didn't expect the dogfighting to be so intense and fun. Been having fun mopping the floor with the enemy (and with some tinkering, a trio of them, and still mauling them).Online Mode is going to be mayhem whenever it's released/possible; moreso when workshop is integrated for all kinds of modes in the long-run alongside it. Definitely worth it for the updates down the line; and even in it's current form.Combat tip:Don't depend too much on thrust, and keep your trajectories relative to the combat at hand. Trust me on this. For those of you that have played Starcon 2: The Ur-Quan Masters, you know what I'm talking about.			"

												First off, don't buy this full price. The game has very, very little content, needs IRL friends, needs gamepad and has no online support. However, this is the kind of game that if you happen to be with one or more friends and gamepads, you can have quite a blast. This is the game that lies dormant in your steam library until the stars align and you can play it. I don't recommend this game full price, but for the few occasion where you'll be able to enjoy it, buying it on the cheap is worth it.			"

								OMFG this game is frakking nuts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pros:Its some of the most fun ive had with a controller in a while. Its very hard, its very fast, yet I am not getting frustrated. It seems to have a steep learning curve to get to a point where you win more times than lose, and to be honest I still feel like when i win its mainly by pure luck that the AI hit one of my mines.I can see this being incredibly satisfying when your skill level increases to a point where you can actually land the shots you want to to kill the enemy and not just kill them by spamming buttons :)The color pallete is nice, very nice.The graphics style is VERY simple, yet it works and feels like it has to be that way otherwise you really wouldnt be able to see whats happening as things happen so fast.The music is good, but needs more tracks.the price is good for the type of game, I think £4 is what i feel happy paying.Cons:Very limited gameplay atm. The only gamemode available is ""Dogfight"", which is just you against AI. (I am unsure if local MP is working)maybe to difficult at times, maybe a difficulty slider would be good.So final thought is it is a great concept, well executed for a good price. But that is only if the whole game getts fleshed out with multiplayer online, moree game modes, more music, more maps etc. As it stands now I would say buy it if you want to support the devs, but if you want a fully fleshed out game then wait a couple of months and keep checking back to see what people say, as its very light on content at this point and that will not please some people.

								[Insert instructions unclear joke here]I don't have a controller so I had to check the control settings for the keyboard and being a silly goof, I kept pressing Enter to select the keyboard settings but nothing happened so I kept pressing other buttons. After some mild frustration and acceptance of my defeat, I sought the almighty and all-knowing sage, Google, for help and found this controls cheat sheet by the developer https://steamcommunity.com/app/289760/discussions/0/540739319701009463/ I know I'm not the only one who had this problem.. or am I?But apart from my personal struggles, it is a fun game to play with friends (jk I have no friends) or by yourself against AI. It has good music and just the right amount of neon that won't make you gouge your eyeballs out. It would be nice if they added a cursor for easier navigation on the menu though for dimwits like me.Is that a rocket in your pocket?			"

								While the sound and the visuals are fantastic, the controls are stiff and hard to use (at least on a keyboard they are) and the rules are never explained so it's a bit confusing. However I know it's still in the works and I have great hopes for this game to go really far!! Definitely try it out!			"

								Some controllers like an arcade stick I use does not work with this game, definitely needs fixing.Totally reminds me of a doujin game Acceleration of Suguri albeit more simplified. Maybe Characters with different abilities and collectable power-ups might help flavor up the game.The game is easily exploitable with turbo mode or a automatic key presser, even if you can hurt yourself its still more of an advantage.This game has potential though.

												Me and my crew play a 'lot' of 4 player couch games. I end up buying just about every one that comes out that seems worth playing. But whenever we sit down for a session, if ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS comes up in the rotation it basically stays up for the rest of the night. It isn't the deepest, most graphically impressive, or most content-rich game. But the fundamental gameplay the devs have hit upon is just 'so good' it outshines any shortcomings. The flight and shooting/blocking mechanics just feel excellent and tense as hell. They have added maps/modes since release, which is welcome and appreciated, but even back when this was just one map and 4 players it was still well worth the price. It's probably best with 2 players, because that's how the (absolutely amazing) dynamic camera functions best, but I've found it totally enjoyable with 4 and that's how I usually end up playing it. If you're in a situation where you can get 2-4 people in the same room, and you like playing stuff like Lethal League/Samurai Gunn/Towerfall/etc... this is a top tier one of those IMO.			"

												Neat game, Neat idea, awesome soundtrack, poor performance. I actually really like this game, its got a lot of potential and i would have loved to have played  it as a party game with my friends, however, this game simply cant hande itself. With four players, or even two, as the players get far apart and the game has to load more of the map, the speed at which the game runs at significantly drops, when it gets to bad then the framerate drops as well. Its playable, but definetly not as enjoyable when you all slow down to turtle speed. tested on several gaming laptops, it definetly seems to be an issue with the game and not laptop performance...Also, DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE THE RESOLUTION!!!!Ruins everything, makes everything invisible, gamebreaking, trust me. dont even try. You can turn down graphical settings, however i find it still didnt help the lagging issue. Works decently fine with 2 people in close proximity, where you can see what the game is meant to feel like.Until the issue is resolved,5.5/10			"

								ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS probably has the most rockets of any game on Steam. The mechanics are simple but solid. The only officially supported game mode in this early Early Access build is one-on-one against the AI, but there's plenty more planned along the way. There's also the ability to fundamentally alter the physics and mechanics via a config file to tweak how the game is played, which is pretty neat. The graphics are basic, but are beautifully stylized and suit the game well. Flying your rocket just feels right which is a pretty crucial thing to nail.I was initially drawn by the similarities to Gimbal, another top-down space shooter. That's about where the similarities end though. Gimbal has a variety of different parts and lets you build your own ships, all with a unique way of handling. ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS puts everyone on an equal playing field with only a few tools, focusing on individual skill. Gimbal is a very serious take on the genre, whereas ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is as crazy and flamboyant as its art style. Both have their appeal, but ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is infinitely easier to pick up and play, especially on the couch for local multiplayer.It should also be noted that you should have a controller to play this game. Keyboard controls are included, but the game is designed around the analog capabilities of the thumbstick. It's also far easier to hammer on the buttons of a gamepad to fire rapidly than on your keyboard, though you can make use of the aforementioned config file to up the fire rate of your weapons when you hold down the button.Lastly, it's important for any Early Access game to have devs that respond to user feedback and actually work on building the game rather than using the Early Access tag as an excuse to sell something that normally would be decried for being incomplete. From my observation of the devs thus far they seem trustworthy, so nothing to worry about on that front. If the concept interests you at all, I'd definitely recommend picking this game up sooner rather than later to get in on it while it's still cheap ($5 at time of writing, $1.25 if you can snag a 75% off coupon).

My only problem with this game is it DOESN'T ♥♥♥♥ING WORK!!!Like, not that it doesn't start up, it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to.Four of us played this game and we can all attest that when you fire rockets on top of rockets on top of rockets your opponent never gets hit. I can actively see the rockets flying directly through the center of my enemies but not hitting them. Then they shoot one ♥♥♥♥ing rocket near me but obviously not hitting and your armor gets blown to ♥♥♥♥sville. Hit detection is attrocious in this game. Luckily I got it in a Humble Bundle and didn't have to waste anything more than our time on this game. (which it isn't worth)1/10 at best!Avoid at all costs! Even if it's free!			"

												Cool game, I wish it had online multiplayer and some sort of single-player arcade mode where it would take you through different levels and maybe change your opponent each time but as it stands the game is a lot of fun.I think it's a good game so it gets a recommendation but unless you have friends over regularly and a computer space to accommodate these friends and an extra controller or three for them I'd hold off and see if more content is added down the line.

								You are a rocket using rocket to kill other rocket and maybe bomb... or another type of rocket.It gets even better when you get up to the part about the rocket but honestly, I'm not sure not enough rocket was applied.9/11. Needed a tad more rocket "

								-------------------------------------Disregard--------------------------------------------Can someone give me a hand here.. the resolution of the game doesnt seem to support my HDtv.. whenever i open the game its literally just the two rockets with the credits and some music.. i cant find a menu, nor can i see a mouse or do anything when i press the entire keyboard of keys.Here, i have attached a screenshot of the full window of the game. http://prntscr.com/3gpugeIt doesnt do anything from there, no matter what keys or mouse buttons i press it just stays on that screen :Ithe only keys that do something are M which turns off the music and ESC which closes the game.-------------------------------------Disregard--------------------------------------------Okay, so basically it doesnt support keyboard control YET.. Though the changelogs state that the game does, however using a controller it works fine. So yeah the game starts a little difficult, the AI kick your♥♥♥♥♥and get fustrating.. so you gotta play for a little while before getting the hang of it, but once you do this game becomes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun! :D worth it in the end, bar the problems I had xD			"

								The most enjoyable waste of time I have ever had...This game has too many rockets, and the controls are wonky and unorthodox, overall it is hard to see what you are doing, and there is a poorly developed Menu system (I spent 15 minutes trying to use the menu). I also had troubles with starting games as the menu showed to use a controller. In the end it is another Indie game made in another day. I do not recommend spending the $5 to play this game. I have played many space shooters, however I believe this is not adequate. "

								This game is pretty awesome. You fly a rocket and shoot at other rockets. It has a great soundtrack, the announcer is very well voiced, the colors used are amazing, and everything works very smoothly with few problems. However, the game is all but unplayable.You see, the rockets all leave trails behind themselves - trails that don't dissappear. The screen quickly fills up with color, so you easily lose track of your rocket. Even worse, the rockets and all projectiles are rather small, so they would be difficult to see without color trails clogging up the screen.I want to like this game. The gameplay seems good, the music is awesome, the game looks great - but I can't. the rockets' color trails and small projectile size make the game all but unplayable.			"

								Maybe it would be fun with a controller and multiplayer, but the other than the awesome soundtrack, the game is really repetitive and uninteresting. The lack of tutorials/directions doesn't help either. This is one of those games that takes 10 minutes to learn how to get past the title screen using an absurd set of controls that, at the moment, can't be changed.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but I experienced some serious motion sickness within the first minute or so of playing. What happens is, whenever you and your enemy get close to each other (which happens regularly), the camera does a quick extreme closeup, and then when you move away from each other very shortly after, the camera does a quick zoom out. Over and over. It was so bad that when I went into the menus to look for visual settings that would reduce it - because surely something like that would exist in a game that does this - I was still getting sick from scrolling through the menus. I can't be sure, but I think they jolt slightly as you move between them. And there is no option to reduce the nausea.Sorry guys.			"

												I was initially drawn to this by just how simple yet bizarre the premise is. the idea of flying a rocket, that fires rockets at rockets while also roughly obeying rocket handling physics sounded like all of my jam. thankfully, after playing this gameafter it fully released, the game lives up to expectations.The game has an interesting sort of light humour about it and runs very smoothly on my system, even in 4K, its graphics are simple but clean and stylised and its sound is great. but all of this would be worthless were the gameplay not there to support it.I can gladly report that the gameplay on this titles is superb. firing rockets is tricky but getting a hit is satisfying, simply flying around requires and easy-to-learn-hard-to-master kind of skill and just how this game handles means that potential groups of up to four could have endless fun with this game. though that said, one person alone can easily find great enjoyment with this title, simply flying around in zen mode and relaxing or playing against some challenging AI.put bluntly, the amount of skill required in this game is refreshing and its gameplay and difficulty curve will suit casual and dedicated players alike.Finally, this game has some of the best controller support I've seen, with support for dualshock 3 and 4 controllers without ever needing any aftermarket software, naturally, Xbox support is baked in too.all told, this is a really great game and i'm glad i played it.

												Oh this is one fun game, you're a rocket and you fight other rockets with rockets while leaving colourful trails that is just so cool to watch. Although it would be a lot better to play this with a controller, I guess. I'm keyboard only. But that doesn't stop you from having fun with a keyboard! I still found it quite playable and it was still amazing. Oh and if you want some zen thing, then it's there waiting for you.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

The graphics are simple and beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing. It is still a very challenging game gut some practice and playing more will be sure to work up your skills.			"

								When I first downloaded this game, I experienced a bug that didn't allow me to play. A quick dialogue with the developer on the forum and a few days later, I was playing. This game is meant to be played with a controller, but I'm playing with my keyboard and having a blast. Just google the controls. The game is just as fun as it looks. This is the first game in a while that had me hooting and hollering with every hit. The AI is incredibly challenging, but losing is part of the fun. I can't wait for future updates! 10/10			"

												This is a very solid game. Per some of the other comments, it's a bit much at full price - I got this game as part of a HumbleBundle, so the price was very reasonable. The local co-op is really entertaining and hectic. You won't be playing this for hours on end, but it's great to fire up and play in smaller doses or with lots of people.			"

												Oh this is one fun game, you're a rocket and you fight other rockets with rockets while leaving colourful trails that is just so cool to watch. Although it would be a lot better to play this with a controller, I guess. I'm keyboard only. But that doesn't stop you from having fun with a keyboard! I still found it quite playable and it was still amazing. Oh and if you want some zen thing, then it's there waiting for you.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

Pros   Great music  Pretty funny with names and such  Games can last, but also can won/lost quickly  Not buggy at all (from what I've seen) Cons   Playing with a keyboard is too difficult.

												Awesome game. The graphics and menus are great, the music is pumping and local multiplayer party games are rarely this good. Only issue would be the range of weapons and power ups available. The missiles and nukes make for great dogfights, but the it is too easy to hit your own bombs for them to be useful. More weapons and powerups would give this game more longevity. Bot AI can often be quite cruel too. Still, its one of my favourite party games on Steam.			"

												I got this game for free. :happymeat:Although I got only one person to play with me, most of the dogfights... Boiled down to sheer luck, as even if you're aiming directly at someone, your projectiles are not guarenteed to hit, or miraculously hit even though they weren't even aimed at you, which is cheap... And controls are fumbly but intuitive once I got used to it.Simply put, this is co-op-versus twin-stick shooter game well done with simplistic graphics.			"

												I was initially drawn to this by just how simple yet bizarre the premise is. the idea of flying a rocket, that fires rockets at rockets while also roughly obeying rocket handling physics sounded like all of my jam. thankfully, after playing this gameafter it fully released, the game lives up to expectations.The game has an interesting sort of light humour about it and runs very smoothly on my system, even in 4K, its graphics are simple but clean and stylised and its sound is great. but all of this would be worthless were the gameplay not there to support it.I can gladly report that the gameplay on this titles is superb. firing rockets is tricky but getting a hit is satisfying, simply flying around requires and easy-to-learn-hard-to-master kind of skill and just how this game handles means that potential groups of up to four could have endless fun with this game. though that said, one person alone can easily find great enjoyment with this title, simply flying around in zen mode and relaxing or playing against some challenging AI.put bluntly, the amount of skill required in this game is refreshing and its gameplay and difficulty curve will suit casual and dedicated players alike.Finally, this game has some of the best controller support I've seen, with support for dualshock 3 and 4 controllers without ever needing any aftermarket software, naturally, Xbox support is baked in too.all told, this is a really great game and i'm glad i played it.

												Psychedelic rockets. Dizzy rockets. Rockets rockets rockets. You need a gamepad for this one. Multiplayer is really the only way to play it. You can fly around aimlessly in Zen mode. Unfortunately, it's only 2+ player couch play only. Otherwise, you're playing against AI.			"
