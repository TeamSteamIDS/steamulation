												I should start this by saying I am not a massive fan of horse racing.  I came upon an early incarnation of this game a few years ago and have been a fan since.The game allows for different levels of play varying from betting only mode through to training and ownership.  You can jockey your own horses or combine the complex mode of owner/trtainer with a simplified training model (my own preference as somebody who has an amateur knowledge of horse racing).The statistical level of the game has comparisons with Football Manager and it is no coincidence that both games are my 'go to games'.  The game you play when you've tired of the latest new game.  The fact that this is now on Steam is a major plus as this is a game that has been regularly updated and improved.  For anybody who knows very little about horse racing but loves statistical management games or anybody who loves horse racing and likes a punt now and then this is defintely worth investing in.			"

												I previously owned this game before it came to steam and have invested so much time into starting from scratch and building various stable dynasties. You can concentrate on flat racing, national hunt (jumps) or both if you so wish. If you're the type of gamer who enjoys management style games such as Football Manager, Front Office, Out of the Park Baseball and enjoy jumping into and divulging statistics and prefer text and data over what others would class as 'graphical gameplay' then you'll love Starters Orders 6. The graphics are actually pretty decent if you choose to watch the races, but for me they are a nice touch that add to the racing aspect. It wouldn't bother me if the horses were simply a number going round a track. For me this game excels in its planning and number crunching.The game really comes alive for me when you unlock the breeding barn. Trying to breed the next super horse is what keeps me playing this game year after ingame year. You can easily clock up hundreds of years of gameplay as your stable grows.Definitely the best horse racing management game I have ever played.I'm not sure if it could be integrated but I'd love to see some sort of future online league through steam. Now that would take this to the next level.10/10			"

												Bought this in the summer sale. Spent more for it than I do for most games--in fact, cleaned out the rest of my available Summer Sale funds to get it because Hey! Horse racing game!Felt a little remorseful, like maybe I could have waited until it went on a better sale like I do with most stuff. Started it up to see if I'd even like it---maybe it would suck or I wouldn't like it THAT much and could get a refund.9 hours of playtime later--all in less than 24 hours, I might add--here I am, writing this review.Exciting? No, not really, but if you think managing things and betting on horse races and trying to build up to Something from Virtually Nothing by way of some good decision-making and a whole lot of luck, this is for you.This is going to be one of my go-to games, never uninstalled, for a long, long, time.

												I have put many months into this game before it was released onto Steam. There is a lot to this game. Different game play modes and modes based on your nationality but it is primarily about spotting potentially good horses at the sales and placing horses in order to increase your stable funds so you can then afford better horses. After playing a few seasons you can then start to breed your own horses. I would say it's definitely a game for racing fans. Others may struggle with some of the racing terminology and the sports complexities. And the game could give better help via a tutorial? The races are passable visually for a sim game but what makes them special is the realistic way they work out. You can see as the jockeys try to follow their orders and weave through the field and sometimes (maybe more often than reality) jockeys can lose a race through poor tactical choices during the race.The game play is quite unusual for a video game in that it doesn't really end. You can play the game for hundreds of seasons if you wish. I tend to play the game quite slowly and try to follow all the form - even of the horses owned by computer controlled trainers! Playing this way can take forever to just get through a single season but it really does draw you in to the point where you feel incredibly involved. Rushing through does not provide any satisfaction for me at all.There is a jockey mode also and other modes such as an 'AI Owner' game where you have to deal with owners rather than buying horses through sales. There is a betting mode and some other modes I have never even looked at. In summary it's a very deep game that rewards time invested and if you have the urge for horse racing management, especially UK based (there are Australian and USA modes also) and are willing to put some time in then there really is no better offering out there. To balance this I would say if you have no interest in horse racing then this game is probably not for you. To the reviewer who complained there is no way to save the game. Have you tried the save button? lol.			"

												I'll start by saying that Starters Orders 6 is a great horse racing SIMULATION game. Don't expect the shiny visuals and arcade-style gameplay of the Gallop Racer series here. As others have stated, this is more or less the horse racing equivalent of the Football Manager series... but if the thought of a realistic menu-based thoroughbred stable management simulator gets you even slightly moist, then you've found the right game.What you'll like:Breeding - Breeding your own horses in Starters Order 6 is as simple as selecting a stallion and mare from a long list of available candidates and letting them GET IT ON while you watch (or not). If you own both horses, it's free of charge, otherwise you'll have to pay a nominal fee based on the racing success of the stallion or mare that you select. Just like in real life, you never know what's gonna pop out later. You can breed as many or as few horses as you want in a racing season and provide all of them with new names when they become two year olds.Auctions - You can buy and sell horses in auctions. Wanna buy that unproven two year old for $100K? Trying to sell off that ten year old with the bucked shins? There's a market for everyone in this game. Stats - All horses have fractional and positional race charts with comments, odds, and on-demand race replays, career statistics, race history, top rating and earnings lists... and even a hall of fame for your best horses. There are seasonal awards given to the top jockey, top owner, and top horses in several categories as well. Racing - Select from over 100 jockeys with just-edited-enough names like P. Napravnik or A. Velasquez and give him or her the ride on your horse in a race. Most (if not all) of the North American ABC tracks are represented, and most graded races are named as you'd expect (The Kentucky Derby, etc.). You can provide a jockey with basic instructions or take control yourself in a first person view. You can even ship your horses around and race in other countries - notable races from Dubai, Hong Kong, Australia, England and Japan are all here.Custom Races - You can export your horses and configure custom races for them. Throw up to 40 of your favorites in a four mile event and see how many actually finish the race. Pit your distance horses against each other in an Iowa sprint for $10 million dollars. Anything goes...What might annoy you:Graphics - They're fairly simple for 2017, but they get the job done. Just don't expect anything too cutting edge here and you'll be fine. They remind me of horseracegame.com or the 3D race predictions on the NBC racing telecasts (if you've seen those)Race Commentary - It's a little strange at times - ""The leader is last!"" OK... whatever.  Don't worry, you can shut it off if it bothers you.Money Management - It's important to manage your money (especially early in the game). You'll probably have to win a few bets or take out a few loans to stay afloat. As your stable grows and your horses start winning the money aspect will become less of a concern until you can almost forget about it completely.Breeding Prospects - The breeding system is great, and very easy to use. However, it would be even better if the computer owners' stallions and mares carried over to future seasons. Sometimes you'll find a top horse to breed to, only to find that he or she is removed from the game the following season, so remember to get as many offspring as you can while you can. No Online Play - There's no built-in online play. Hopefully future Starters Orders games will make this a reality. I think there's leagues on the forums, but I've never used them.Final VerdictDon't buy Starters Orders 6 for the jockey mode. It won't justify the price and will leave you disappointed. If you like sports management sims (Football Manager, OOTP, etc) and have an interest in horse racing... you'll probably really enjoy it. It's challenging, rewarding, and very well-made. I bought it at $19.99 shortly after release. I'd still definitely recommend it at the current price of $34.99.			"

												 I own races horses in RL and even though this game is a far cry from real life, it is very entertaining. On those long nights sitting in the office in the foaling barn waiting for a mare to foal, I thoughly enjoy playing this game. It is a fun way to pass the time. I like playing the owner game because of the simplified bredding consept and trying to target specific distances with the offspring but I think I am more enetrtained by the trainer game and trying to make good with the horses that clients send to you and hoping that after an Open House, I can attract clients with better horses. It is very possible in the Owner game to have a stable full of super horses by the time your 3rd crop of foals hit the track but with the Trainer game, it can be difficult to draw in those Super horses to sweep the all important Grade 1 races to boost income so you can rise through the trainer standings. I have won almost all the big G1 races but after playing many seasons in both the trainer and owner games, one G1 still eludes me, the Melborne Cup. The aquisition of that 2 mile monster than can win that race just seems to evade me. I will win that race one day but until then, I will just keep playing.			"

												I love horse racing and I am a big fan of the Gallop Racer video game series that was on the Playstation 1 and 2.  This game is nothing like Gallop Racer, so if you are a fan of that series stay away.  This game is not user friendly and the graphics on max settings are on par with cell phone games.  If you like text based sim games you might find something enjoyable here, but honestly I didn't bother sticking around long enough to check that part out and I just refunded it because even at the sale price of $25 this game still wasn't worth it.  I don't know how this game is being sold for $34.99.  Let's hope more horse racing games will be released on steam.			"

												I wasn't sure what to expect with this game. I like horses, and managerial/tycoon-like games. I know nothing about horse racing.At first, I was disappointed by the graphics and turned off by all the lingo and acronyms, and I had to google a lot of the horse racing terms in order to make sense of the game. There's no hand-holding or walkthrough here. With that out of the way, the game starts to get interesting. Essentially, this game is based on decision-making, weighing gains/risks, and money management.. and it's addicting.If you're looking for a horse racing simulator, you can choose to do that too, but you'll probably find it a bit repetitive, and would rather skip past that part to get results faster and continue to build up your horses over a campaign of races.For those that are confused with the lingo, the most important statistic is the horse's RTG (rating). In order to increase the chances of winning races, enter horses in races where they are closer to the top end of RTG. You can view the RTG of other contestants when you enter a race, and decide whether your horse is competitive. Handicap races are the easiest way to build this up. Buying young, cheap horses that had a bad first race or two, building some RTG and selling them is a great way to make profit and progress your stables early on.I got this game on sale for $30, which (to me) is a lot for a game that isn't pretty or flashy, and is really difficult to learn for someone who isn't familiar with horse racing. Once you get past the learning curve, it becomes a very engaging managerial/decision-making game that you'll get the itch to load up several times a day for juuuuuust another race or ten.			"

												I have enjoyed playing  Starters Orders since the days when it was called Stable Masters on the Amiga all those years ago it was a basic game back then but over time it has improved with every reincarnation.If you enjoy Management games this is a must for you even if you have never watched a horse race this will fullfil your hunger for more and more you can't breed your own Football Player but you can breed your own Grand National or Derby winner even the American triple crown winner this game will keep you busy for hours and with the 3D Graphics and Jockey Mode this is the Best the Sport Of Kings game around.Once you think your unbeatable you can then test your horses against other trainers horse's in the Online League with 13 weeks of Action on the Flat and over the Jumps taking all the best races around the world on the flat from all the classics like the Dubai World Cup the English Classics like the  Guineas to the USA Breeders Cup and the Melbourne Cup From Australia and the Jumps Taking all the big races through to the Cheltenham Festival and the Aintree Grand National the league is run by Volumteers and you can watch the races with actual real commentary provided by other trainers on You Tube the league has it own Website so for the price of £20 this is a must buy game.Gray "

												One of the few Horse Racing games on Steam. So far enjoying it. It is like the Football Manager of Horse Racing :)Ok, after over a week playing it you can tell by the time I have put on this game that I really enjoy it. Now dont get me wrong it can get frustrating with some things. For instance the outdated overview screen can be confusing especially for someone that doesn't follow horse racing very closely. Neverthelless after a few seasons of playing you get what everything means and how important upgrading your barn, stables etc is.This game has it all, it really will keep you playing for a very long time and although it looks simple it is actually very challenging especially if you are like me and dont use or do any cheats or easy ways of making cash.worth it all! get the game.

												I think the game is niche. You must like either management sims a lot, or know something about horse racing and like sims some. I am in the latter, so I sink so, so many hours into planning. That makes this game a fantastic investment for entertainment for cost. So, if you get into it, it will be an excellent game. I can see it not grabbing everyone though. The document in the base directory is a must read, and it really helps to browse through the usual questions on the game's site forum.			"

												I'm not a horse racing guy, but do love simulation games. I consider Football Manager to be the gold standard of sports sim games and Starters Orders is pretty close to that standard. It's really deep and can be addicting once you get the hang of the mechanics of the game. For me, learning those mechanics on top of having to educate myself on the sport of horse racing was a bit of a chore, but worth it in the end. I'm by no means an expert, but have learned enough to build a solid stable with breeding facilities. If you want to create your own stable and have a career that spans hundreds of years (keeping track of your horse racing world stats), you can do that. If you want to control your races by being the jockey (VR supported), you can do that. If you just want to bet on races, you can do that. If you want to spend time breeding high potential horses and slowly export them into a supersave to start your horse racing career you can do that (it also tracks your breeding lineage which I think is pretty cool).Once you learn the basics of horse racing, race types, season scheduling and get a handle on all of the stats and pre-race considerations, you will be on your way to hundreds of hours of enjoyment. All of the data you need to build a successful horse racing dynasty is in-game. The manual is fairly detailed, but if you're new to horse racing, you will need to look at some other sources online.I've watched a fair amount of youtube videos but found GRaiders videos the most helpful because he was new to horse racing and this game- so while at times it was a little painful to watch, you'll find that many of the questions you have about the game unfold as he plays. Most of those questions are answered which gives you a nice foundation of knowlege to start with.I think that this game is well worth 30 bucks and am happy with my purchase.			"

												Generally think it's pretty good. I enjoy it. Would be nice to be able to design and then use own custom silks for your yard rather than be forced to chose from a limited number of real world based designs. Improve graphics in jockey mode? I realise  jockey mode is not the main feature of the game but the appearance of the horse and jockey models are quite poor when playing this feature.My most desired feature would be to allow a player to be both a trainer-owner AND train for other owners in the same game mode - like occurs in real life.

I know very little about real life horse racing, but to me this ""feels right"". The 3D racing graphics are like an old mobile phone game, but it doesn't really matter.

Great fun, whether you already have a prior in depth knowledge of Racing or not. Doesnt have quite the depth of FM (but then not many games do) but def has enough to keep it interesting, yet also easy enough to just get into at a light fun easy gaming level and not have to be too buried in.Still room for improvement of course, could do with better filtering when it comes to searching and selecting races to enter, as well as improved horse history (ie how much you paid for a horse and detailed costs/earning history)But overall, if you enjoy Sports Management style games, this is definitely a fun enjoyable and entertaining alternative to check out			"

												Despite being the only ""decent"" attempt at a horse racing game on any platform that I know of this game is just horrible. The UI is awful, the tutorial - well the tutorial doesnt exist other than a few tool tips, when you book a jockey to ride your horse some random jockey will end up riding it instead, and when you make bets they don't always register correctly. You will spend your available time to refund the game's purchase just trying to work out how to get your horses into a race (the only reason I didn't was because I tried the demo first and hoped that the full game would fix what I considered to be disabled features), think you have bet a few thousand on the winner only to find the bet was placed on some other horse instead, and be outbid on all but the most useless nags at auction. It may be the only horse in the race as far as horse racing games goes but this is that three legged donkey you will wish you had bought a few beers rather than taking a punt on. The 'complexity' is an illusion created by the non intuitive interface, the core of the game will quickly seem very simplistic to those experienced with management games, and this would be a dubious buy even were it released as a budget title. To compare it with Football Manager as a management game is laughable so the Pocket Lint quote is just that - pocket lint. I can't comment on the VR aspect of 'jockey mode'.*edit* one other thing, the rrp of this game (direct from dev site) is less than it is sold here (£25 not £30) so the 25% off is actually closer to the standard 10% for new indie games and I find this to be very disingenuous.This game DOES get the award for most hilariously bad commentary, however, ""the leader is last"".

												I am not goign to rate this up or down yet.Biggest problem i find with the game is absolutly no Tutorial at all. From the moment you launch teh game your left on your own and to figure things out from the outset. For many this will be a no no and people will give it a thumbs down instantly and refund without giving it a chance.As for me, i am going to give it teh benefit for now, I will play and try it and decide whether to keep it or refund it. Right now it has good things but teh bad things also are taking precedence over it.			"

												Great thinkers man game. Really, really addictive and fun to play as you build up your horses and try to make your millions. Not for noobs as there is a bit of a learning curve or anyone who doesn't enjoy studying text based games like FM. If you like FM you will love this.			"

												I know nowt about horses. Sod all about betting. Never even seen a horse race. When one comes on the telly and it's skipped immediately, no interest. But as a lazy gamer, reaching that age where I enjoy a good management sim without having to worry too much about all the intracies of making cash/building an army/running a hospital/theme park etc this is right up my street.Kick back, look at lists of horses, hire winning jockeys, read the form book, study trainers...and then just put everything on a horse that has the funniest name.You can build your own farm but it doesnt need micro managing, just plough your winnings into new facilities and it looks after itself.  There is some skill in this I'm sure, but thats not why I'm here. Just a few hours of occasional mouse clicks, lots of reading and then getting unbelievably excited when your 5 furlong nag starts to pull away in a 2 mile steeple chase.I've made a shed load of cash, lost a shed load more and  learned new things (like how long a furlong is to start with!).It's just a whole heap of relaxing fun. Casual gamers will love this as much as I'm sure the Horse Racing purists do. big thumbs up.  "

												+Mods are available to make the game more realistic (jockeys, courses, horses, trainers, etc.)+Best horse racing simulator out there (I guess that's something)+Exciting game when you're breeding horses-Lags a lot, and I don't even get lag on GTA V (FX-6350, RX480 and 8GB RAM)-Unbearable commentating. ""The leader - Is - The leader - Number 8 - Has fallen - Is the leader""-No easily accessible editor.Overall, as a huge horse racing fan I give this game a 7/10 but from outside that sphere this game could probably scrape 3/10. Recommended for horse racing fans but only if you install mods, otherwise stay away from this one.			"

												I love this game. Besides a few improvements like more races for 1.1m and up 2yo its good! It needs an indepth tutorial because non horse racing people would have a hard time understanding what a G1.G2.G3 races are and the rating sysytem. Graphics are good. lots of game time to play. breeding is awesome. being able to name our own horses would be cool too. more upgrade options for the barns. maybe more achivments? all in all good game.
