												I was excited about this game before the release but I have to say I am disappointed.I did not expect too much from the graphics side, but what I got was just horrific. Colours, lightin etc. are just awful and embarrassing.But I know PES is not about graphics and I have to say that gameplaywise we got a few upgrades. Goalkeepers are actually doing their job during the game, passing feels even better.After the first 45 minutes I closed the game and opened PES 2016. Here, I have to add that I have several patches, transfer updates, pitch update installed on PES 2016. The game just felt much better. Even the graphics looked nicer. Colors were brighter and the quality just better. Even the gameplay felt almost the same.So If you are asking me: Does it worth buying it?My answer is a definite NO. Just use PES 2016 with transfer updates and you are safe to go.PES was never for online playing and you can have fun offline with 2016.			"

												Using an old gen engine when the newer one is available is a big mistake on Konami's part. People who can afford to pre-order the game, would most likely have the money to afford a decent rig on their pc to run the higher end graphics. What was designed for PC gamers, with the lower end graphics, is probably tailored more for people who torrent.I'm neither a suppporter of Fifa nor Pes. But I feel that what Konami has done is simply shooting themselves in the foot and killing what limited PC supporters that they currently have. Having said that, I dont mind slightly inferior graphics. I do mind, however, 1) long loading times between menus, 2) long waiting times for online matchmaking, 3) frequent disconnection, 4) inability to alt tab (without getting disconnected) while waiting for the game to finish loading. For people who wish to buy a PES title, it would probably be better to choose between whichever title is of the lower price, since the improvements over the titles are only marginal at best. Until massive improvements are made to the core game itself, I would probably not recommend users to buy the game at full price.			"

												I played PES EVERY YEAR since ISS 2. With 2014 they promised a ""new engine"" but the gameplay was the worse I've ever seen in PES, that year I stopped playing wishing ""they would improve the graphics and gameplay with time, it's a new engine after all!"". How wrong I was, 3 years later the graphics look WORSE, the ""new"" user interface is slow and trying to copy the crappy one from FIFA (that's not the spirit). The gameplay was OK versus the COM, but my god it's really bad my online experience, it's like playing in 5 FPS.PROS:- Better gameplay than in 2014- MusicCONS:- Bad Graphics (PS2 style)- Bad online experience- Bad interface- No Real Madrid Licence- No new stuff in Master League (they even took the good stuff)			"

But this about game improvements, are not true. Laggy, sluggish, not new movements and things, no ""control"", same AI trying to ""magically beat you"" when you are on a win streak, even if you get as opponent with 50 ""team spirit"" and you play way better, The AI will make you lose.   For me just the same as 2016. I'll ask for a refund and just stay with pes 2016 for a while . (I own fifa and pes in ps4) Pes 2017 in pc is just a mockery, a scam for pc users.			"

												Buying this game, I knew it would be wack...I bought it because (based on experience) gameplay on PES is superior to FIFA. A much truer representation of the real game. Tempo, Ball Weight, Player positioning, Choices, Adaptation to players on the team, even animations and the choice of animations in a particular scenario is fantastic, gives you a satisfying feeling. You feel as though you can watch a game over the weekend and recreate it later in PES. FIFA on the other hand, (I've played every FIFA since 99 where you had to button mash the triangle button to run faster lol, used to be a fan also) since probably 09 where online multiplayer became an integral part of the game. It has stalled in terms of progress. So called better graphics were prioritised over game mechanics, and focus was solely placed on the multiplayer experience. The really bad AI of the game was hidden behind the fact that you played other humans and loads of licenses, so you only saw the lack of authenticity in gameplay in glimpses.  It became an Arcade game.Now, PES on consoles is going places. Much better graphics, players feel realistic in terms of proportions and movement, shading. You can play by yourself and enjoy the game, online is not needed, it's a welcome addition, etc... My question is.... Why the f@%k are PC gamers getting taken the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•out of?!Why are we playing a last gen game import for two years in a row now? It's ridiculous. If you are scared of people cracking your games then you are loosing a foot in where the industry is heading. More and more people buy products after they have tested them out and been satisfied with the product quality. (product does what it says on the box). Most gaming companies are all following the road of coning customers up until the release date after which they just go quiet and let people buy a half hearted game.No improvement what so ever from the last game. If it wasn't for the fact that. 1. I got it on discount. 2. The modder community is amazing. 3. I am hoping something goes through to Konami where they see that people on PC will buy their game if they don't alienate us from the REAL game.Lastly, don't ever charge 40 quid for what could essentially pass as an Indie game. Have some respect... "

												Have played pro-evo for many years.Like a crooked pachinko machine this game decides the outcome of matches before they are played - EVEN ONLINE.I wanted to like it but unfortunately due to the horrible momentum mechanics cannot.Players will be slowed down by engine to stop you getting ball.Opposition will run through your playersMagical rebounds will always go to opposition from stupid angles at certain periods of the game (when the coded ' luck' is against you).At these same periods you will hit crossbar, post and miss goal even from inside the 6 yard box.Game plays like its on rails. Your players will get magically pushed behind the opposition, even when you were on course to intercept.Game will also automatically switch player selection or just disable it to stop you receiving ball.First few games you will not notice it and I think its dialled back (probably so you give it a great review before it dumps its steaming load all over your face).I feel sorry for those who think by spending real money and getting better players improved this. It does not.This could have been great, but I think their greed pretty much put the nail in the coffin on this one.I keep coming back and playing to see if any of the terrible momentum and scripting is patched out, but never is.Wont spend any money on this game and would advise anyone to hang off from the next version (2018) until the momentum / scripting has been dialled back sufficiently.EDIT BTW dont think the demo is a fair example of the game. It is not, as it plays better due to the horrible momentum being turned off. This has been confirmed by Konami.			"

												I was a fan of PES until the 2016 edition. 2016 edition is really a promising even though there are still some problems occur. I had a high hope that Konami will fix some major problems from the 2016 edition just like license, online feature, or etc. I really excited about every news about the newest edition.But now I really dissapointed with the new one. I admit that the gameplay in 2017 is really fantastic especially for the goalkeeper and AI adaptive system, but  same comment for many people, it seems they don't really care for us PC users. The graphic (for PC) almost doesn't even has any different with PS2 console. And as usual, the license is really awful, Manchester United and City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Valencia, and also Juventus don't have their kits and use fake names?! Bayern Munchen doesn't even appeared in the game and again.....license problem. Commentaries also still monoton. You'll find Jim Beglin and Peter Drury say the same words within 90 minutes everytime you play. And overall, this edition is dissapointing.			"

												Don't pay Konami to give you a headache, First design wise, this is an embarrassment for user interfaces in 2016, all menus are blue on blue sometimes you miss your selection cause its in the same colors as the background. There are way to many menus and they are inconsistent with each other, it feels like a huge mess I'm playing this for a month now and I still haven't figured out all the redundant options and menus they've stuck in there. Game play is not at the AI level I've expected, PES 2016 feels smoother and much more fun to play for me, If you dont play with messi or ronaldo don't expect your player to do one touch passes or shots,It takes ages until a player like Nani (level 86 at my club) will recieve a pass and hold that ball as a normal player should. Now for the biggest problem of the the game of course ""MyClub"", I don't know who is using the player that you get from white balls, and bronze balls you'll find yourself spending 300k+ very hardly earned Game Points going to waste until you'll get a dissent player, in a month of playing the only black ball player I have is Kroos, and bealive me that's not enough when you're going against players that buy coins or harvest GP all day. When you lose a match you get a sad 1200 GP and then you have to pay every time for contract renewales 2500+ GP, so if you get to lose few games in a row prepare to get extremely frustrated, cause you won't be abale to play with your best players on top of the fact you lost a few games. Internet servers are now better than they were when the game was just released and a lot of bugs that cheaters used are now fixed but it took way to much time and caused a lot of frustration because too many cheaters used this. And something last, how the hell a company that's releasing this game for so many years dares to say ""The PC version won't be at the level as PS4/XBOX"" on the same day they release it?? this is outrageous, this is a spit on the face of the customers, this is unacceptable.

												It's easy to say ""ignoring the graphics is it worth it"" but unless you have cataracts the size of Kansas you simply cannot ignore how monumentally ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ugly the game is, it's not just the graphics themselves, the animations are still extremely poor IMO, they look like something I'd expect when I download a mod off the modding nexus that 3 guys did after school for fun. Menus are horrific, ugly, poorly laid out, extremely slow to navigate, Master League (only league I have interest in coming from MM/CM of Fifa) is still flat, uninspiring, poorly programmed and completely devoid of any kind of connected feeling compared to Fifa with the proper league structure and transfer system and such. Don't get me wrong Fifa is filled with flaws and annoyances which will be compounded by the lack of mod support in Fifa 17 (I detest FOW in CM!) but it still offers a far more cohesive, engaging football club manager experience, on and off the pitch.Just had my first experience of PES' idea of transfer deadline day, oh dear, apparently you can only negotiate one player at a time, if I have two deals agreed you cannot say yes to both, you say yes to one, time moves on two hours, then you can say yes to the other, seriously? I thought how Fifa handled transfer deadline day was bad but it's mindblowingly well designed compared to how PES handles it (TBH the way PES handles the whole transfer process is poor).So in brief, is PES 2017 for PC worth it? Yes, if your sole purpose is to play it until the 27th so you can be happy in the knowledge that Fifa hands-down beats it in every single area of game design, visuals, sound quality, animation, gameplay, UI, modes, licenses, etc. etc.			"

												I am disgusted... I love that game so much since PS1. PES 2016 was the rebirth but on this one again: online is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing shxxxt... Lag lag lag, whatever the connection (home or office), whatever the PC & config. You never know if servers are lagging or if you're playing against lag switchers. You simply can't play your normal play. Full of cheaters: Mali running, jumping, dribbling better than Chelesa... Most of players simply take Real and just pass through the Bale or Ronaldo rabbids... In short an incredible gameplay potential but Konami is not taking PC seriously with bad online infrastructure, laggy connections, loooooooong match-making & no anti-cheat. All that can disgust any fair player to invest deeper in that game.			"

												I've ben a PES fan for years, but this is just getting ridiculous. The game play is definitely better than 2016, but the graphics are the same. I played the PS4 demo and was impressed by the graphics quality so I decided to buy the PC version hoping the graphics would be improved as well, but as usual Konami has screwed PC users over.*Update* I've been playing for a few months now and while the graphics still suck, I've kinda gotten used to it. I still vastly prefer the PS4 visuals to it, but since I game mostly on my PC I've grown accustomed to it. Outside of the crappy grapics and random glitches here and there, the game is prety enjoyable. The gameplay is very similar to the PS4 version, but not quite as polished and flowing. I still wouldn't recommed buying the PC version of the game, but Master League is so enjoyable that it just might make up for the game's other failures.			"

I was hoping Konami would beat Fifa this year, but it seems like it got worse. Licensing issue is also really annoying. It detracts from the ""realistic"" feeling of the game.

												I completely understand all of the negative reviews for the PC version of this, and the game as is for the full price of 39.99 pounds would be a thumbs down.However, with SweetFX mod installed, the game looks as good as the console versions, and the patch to fix the licences, names and kits etc takes less than a few minutes to install.On the pitch, PES 2017 is by far and away the superior game compared to Fifa 17 (I own both).Also helps that I got almost 50% off the retail price for the steam key. You know where to go for that :)			"

												The gameplay is awesome at first. After winning a few games in a row the scripting kicks in and makes the game unplayable. The game just won't let you win. Last game I played (offline season) I had 17 shots, 10 on target. Shots from distance, headers from 5 yards out, curlers, knuckleshots... Their goalie just took everything or I hit the bar. Then the opponent had one shot from like 35 yards out and my goalkeeper pushed the ball right in the feet of Ag√ºero. Game ended 0-1 and it was the game that made Everton win the league. I would've won if I had even taken a point from that game.And oh yeah, Yaya Toure running faster than Aubameyang on break and slidetackling the ball away from behind in the box is legit as hell. :DStill waiting for a good football game for playing offline seasons. This game is almost as carbage as Fifa but it doesn't even have the leagues I'd like to play. Uninstalling now and never playing it again.			"

												Well I've installed it..then spent about an hour trying to connect to the server with all kinds of errors showing up (seems to be working now)...played a vs com match in the meanwhile and was quite dissapointed. I've been playing PES since ISS 98 and never considered about going to FIFA since then but I'm seriously considering it now. Graphics (with best settings in 1080p; I7 6700K and GTX 1070 on my PC specs) looks terrible, way worse than 2016 version. But I was willing to ignore that, wait for the mods and so on..and then I've noticed another problem - altough my PC is able to run almost every game at ultra settings and PES recommended settings could easily make this game run on almost every decent PC, it's clearly extremely bad optimised - when playing in offline mode agains COM it runs ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and I mean just awful... with stutters and delays.Honestly I would not recommend paying 50 EUR for this game and I'm now quite sorry I did. Konami you do not deserve your customers!!!!!! All you do is make fun of them on their own expense!!!And if anyone's curious about the gameplay:

												Absolutely frustrating gameplay!I'm a long time pes/wining eleven fan for as long as the series came out, and after a streak of worsening games since pes 2006, the series came slightly again above water in the itteration last year. This year it has improved (as they claim they do every year), but again, only superficially.And this is the problem of PES, which hasn't been resolved or renewed or looked upon from konami. It seems well polished at first, but the more you play this last last version, the more you feel the 'scripted' flow of the game. AI just changes over time, and consistency has become a chore, not a way of playing. It completely gets the fun out of the game, and out of the joy what football is about. Im not talking about scoring incredible goals, or dribbling your way up to the goalie on a solo run (which has gotten more attention of the programmers every year again), but making space, creating opportunities, opening the game up, forcing it with YOUR team, and not because of the influence of a scripted AI. In honest, you have to know the series to know what im talking about. If you look at gameplay of PES,  you see a typical build-up of football, 'especialy on the higher difficulties: players passing one time passes over the whole field from a large distance (sometimes from immposible physical animations), players always running down a complete flank, which is completely not credible and feels more arcady than realistic. The AI is just a machine and thats exactly how this game feels, playing a machine, it feels like PES is playing you and not the other way around. This was the case after pes 2006, but it only got worse over time ,and every year the developers promise a rehaul, a back-to-the-top experience, but it fails year after year.Dont get me wrong, PES does things quite right, and there are definitely fun factors in the game, and nothing beats a game versus a friend, but what always attracted me in PES was the master league, building your club, improving it, attracting new players, getting stronger in playing the game, adapting to the AI, to eventually playing on the hardest setting and developing your own style untill you 'mastered' it. But the longevity of 2017's gameplay has a short span, and gets repetitve after a while. And thats not what PES is about, or the legacy of PES and its immersive gameplay, those days are long gone, and probably not coming back.5/10			"

												Even if you look beyond the HORRIBLE graphics and the horrible licensingthere are three  glaring problems which make it unplayable1- every single menu you will get a testing network settings or establishing connection, non stop, from screen to screen - it makes it almost so horrid, slow and clunky2 - after every cutscene/ ball out of play, there is a 2 second pause between game resumes, and it really takes away from the free flowing feeling of a fifa3 - the boring Jim Beglin`s same boring commentary linesThere are many more issues such as lag/ cheaters etc  - but those points above make it unplayable, and i am sure that the positive reviews are fake - NOBODY can be even remotely satisfied with such a P.O.S of a game, in almost 2017!

												Graphics: It was known that this would not be upto the current gen console levels, but despite low expectations I was still disappointed. The crowd are a bunch of synchronized zombies, players look awkward celebrating, the pitch textures are awful. The graphics are a huge letdown.Gameplay: The gameplay is good with the passing slick and the movement fluid. Although Messi goofed up a couple of times and ran past the ball which was played to him, i'd still play this if Konami would quit ignoring the platform and make a genuine effort at a game and not a port.Overall, I'm playing the FIFA 17 demo till the full game comes out.

												I don't know of another game franchise that causes such enormous butthurt every year.The majority of negative reviewers set themselves up for a fall every time. I'm not here to moan about kits, faces, or the lack of raindrops in cutscenes. All of that will be solved by the modders in the next couple of weeks.Basic advice is, if you want graphics and licenses, buy FIFA and enjoy playing soul-less ping-pong with spotty teenagers. At least your players will wear the correct colour socks, and you'll be happy.If you are looking for the best footie gameplay then PES is for you. Both games have demos - try them for yourself and see.I have owned every iteration since the ISS days. Must admit I was very disappointed with the three versions after 2013.Konami, instead of improving on what they had, decided to tear-up that progress and start again with a new engine. It has taken until now - three years - for the major annoyances and exploits to be ironed-out. PES gameplay is once again king IMO. This is not to say that PES 2017 is perfect. Far from it!The presentation is awful as usual, and there are some in-game control niggles that still need to be addressed.And I agree that PC players deserve next-gen graphics. Konami have been massively disingenuous in this respect. Looks: 5/10Gameplay: 9/10			"

												I am reviewing this as someone who only plays offline master league.Its a good game, but I am down voting it because when you play this game at the highest difficulty it is broken, i feels like it holds the player back but restricting movements, passing and also referee decisions.I have lost count of the times an opposition striker has pushed my defender out of the way during an ariel contest illegally then scored with no free kick paid.  Then when my striker does a diving header and scores the goal is disallowed because contact is made with the defender, even though the striker clearly wins the ball.(the CPU can commit illegal fouls for the most part and get away with it, you cant)The through balls in this game are rubbish, it feels nerfed to prevent clear goal scoring chances:Assisted - This means you select where you want the ball and the game disregards all the power and direction you input to instead put the ball in the path of a defender.Non-assisted - No consistancy, ball is either passed too soft of too hard, even if you do the same actions.I have enjoyed this game, but it ridiculous how it tries to curb scoring and forces negative game play (the majority of teams play with their whole team in their own half even if their 3-0 down). Its just not fun. "

												Worst sequel ever, RIPOFF, and avoid this 2017the graphics are NOT better than 2016, but ""playability"" is way worse, the game laggs all of a sudden due to constant updates that CAN NOT BE TURNED OFF, and on extreme machine where 2016 worked like a chard on ultra high graphics, this version stutters on plain high. Also, there are NO REAL MADRID and such ""big name"" clubs but some no-name clubs and logos. I still stay surprised that there are real names like ""MESSI"", ""RONALDO"" etc, that KONAMI gave us that much of a satisfaction.I am going for a refund for this ripoff because of all that, and no response from great KONAMI abotu any of the before mentioned to fix thisAlso, videos and pictures are NOT from ingame because this DOES NOT look not even near all that.CONSTANTLY disconnecting on stable 50+ Mbps in the middle of the game ...

												Ignore all the hate and bad comments in these reviews below. Why? because i've been a PES Fan since the first PES 1 Game on PS1 , and this PES 2017 has one of the best Gameplays (it just reminds me of PES 6 combined with PES 2013 and 2016).So why do people complain? Simply because it has bad Graphic Quality for PC + Missing licenses. For the bad Graphics you can add SweetFx or any other Graphic Mod that you can find in PES-Patch webiste (just google it). And for Licenses? If you didn't know yet, there are like dozen of PES Patchers who work so hard every year to fix licences and kits + add new cool things for the game. My best Patch is PTE Patch (which will be released in these following days). If you want, you can check my YouTube channel where i post lot of tutorials about PES games, just search for ""Del Choc"" in YouTube. One final thing, i'm not promoting the game nor i like Konami, it's the opposite i guess (for many personal reasons). Just wanted to give my honest opinion that's all.			"

												I bought the game. Played it for a while on PC. It was ok. I think PES 2016 is actually better. I had moddded it with graphical upgrades to look really nice I thought.Then I played it on PS4 with a mate this evening. Holy crap its way better. Really ashame to be honest.This new PES 2017 was a huuuuge letdown. Apparently it is a very bad port to PC.If you were really into PES 2016 - and I WAS (+1000 hrs) - then stick with 2016.

												Welcome to PES  15.3, or maybe that should be 15.0.3, written for a console that was released 11 years ago.  11 friggin years ago. This game is just no fun, and I feel like I have already played it for 3 years.Zero originality, Just update the kits and chuck it out the door to make some cash.Playing on manual controls just make you want to scream.They have gone a step back with the old players on rails. You hardly feel you have any control at all.The game almost ignores your input. Classic football game philosophy. Might as well let the cpu just play.They always claim amazing new AI, but it‚Äôs the same old garbage. Players don't see space,they stutter runs all over the place. You can be half way through powering a pass into spaceand the AI will do an insane U turn for no reason. So, so often.If you paid full price for this minor update you must be pretty annoyed.Basically, please ctrl-A , shift-del on the PC / 360 version, and just leave us alone.			"

												The game is awful in all angles.Players are slow. They react slow. They can't do anything without taking an extra touch. This game is a symbol of lazy programming. No effort made to improve the game play at all. The graphics are pretty bad. If you think PES 2016 was bad then PES 2017 is way worse. You have no control of your players movement. Defending is horrific and all based on luck. Defenders will let balls run pass them without making the slighest effort no matter how hard you press the key to move them even with the cursor on them. Is is either that or your cursor will magically disappear leaving you with no choice but to watch your opponent coast trhough your defense. All that to favor the likes of Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Suarez, Robben, etc... Major teams licenses are gone. This is how Konami view licenses. When gamers complain about not having certain teams in the game, they promise to get licenses for them. When they do get it, they lose it for some teams they had licensing for already. Basically, Konami is saying to gamers, you want Dortmund no problem, you got it. Oh hey by the way in order to fulfill your request we got rid of Juventus, Manchester United, Real Madrid. Happy now gamers. YAY!!!If you wanna waste your time and money on this piece of crap, go ahead. Otherwise, do not buy this piece of crap. All gamers should alway keep in mind that pes demos will always be great. They will put their heart and soul into a demo because they want you to buy. For the full version, they just give you garbage. Nothing you can do they got your money.			"

												After years of being a fan of PES I have no other option but to admit its failure. For years I've bought PES for my PS2 and PC, but it doesn't matter to their (KONAMI's) support. Without even talking about the fact that year after year KONAMI decides that the PC users shouldn't get the finished product, and year after year they releas a less finished version for PC. Without even talking about the amount of licences they omit year after year. I'm talking about being there for your users.After years of playing on daly base I encountered an error on PES 2017, error SGJC 427, while trying to play online. After one update PES team made, I just couldn't play online anymore (played before, didn't do anythong on my computer, and after the update I just couldn't). I restarted my PC, restarted my router, re-installed the game but nothing helped, so I decided to contact the support (after trying to reach them on FB didn't help). After waiting two days for a reply, they told me to restart my router (WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ON THE MESSAGE I SENT, SAYING I JUST DID). So I tried another time, telling them that my message wansn't even read. That time they send me a 10 bullets list, of data I should try to give them (most people I know would've quitted that exact moment). After giving them info about my ISP, network architecture in my country and much more data, I kept waiting for a solution. None was given. They just ingonred my message for about a week. AND I'M SICK OF IT. I'M SICK OF DEVELOPERS THAT DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE USERS THE SECOND THEY GET THE MONEY. Due to the fact that the game is being sold as a multy-player online game, and I cannot play online because of a bug PES develpoers made, I want a refund.Bottom line, DON'T. Just don't buy the game. The second KONAMI got your money, no one will give a damn on your problems, no one will try to help you, no one will answer your questions or try to solve your problems. It's you on your own against bugs they insert on weekly updates. They don't deal with hackers and they don't deal with legit players. They just want you to buy.			"

												Maybe the worst pes after 2014. pass a through ball to your wingers, cross, goal. even iniesta can score a header when surrounded by chiellini and pepe. but wait! you magically didn't score a header because the goalkeeper made a save? no problem, the goalkeeper will still punch the ball towards you while your teamates have a moment of retardation. bang, easy goal. the worst thing is, if you know how to play pes, you will lose all the time. you will have 15 shots, 9 on target and only 1 goal. while the noob opponent will have 2 headers and he wins 2:1. and it's been like this since it came out and won't fix it. they don't want to. also, did i tell you about the SPECIAL agents in myclub? get ready for 80% silver ball in a special agent. yes, a special agent. with silver balls. above 11%. this game is a joke. the online mode is not worth buying it, just download a cracked game and be happy you didn't waste money on this least football-ish football game ever :)			"

												Although it's fun to play, the last gen port is simply unnacceptable. It doesn't even come with the benefits you would expect, Fifa being next gen and 1000x better visually than this, also runs so much smoother, I experience frame drops even on a GTX 970m which is quite frankly ridiculous given how dissapointing this is visually. Saying that, I still think it is the better football game on PC.tl;dr:- poor performance (frame stutter on a GTX 970m)- poor visually (last gen port.. again.)- Referee's are very poor and will give random fouls for fine tackles or completley ignore others which is very frustrating- Offsides are sometimes clearly shown to be wrong in the replay+ gameplay feels smooth and fluid (when there is no frame stutters, which happen often)the fact that they've screwed the PC community over AGAIN and charged full price means I can't give this a positive review regardless.

												Graphics aside, this game is bad! PES 2016 >> PES 2016(PC) >>>>>>>> FIFA 16 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>PES 2017.They nerfed player speed, inceased the amount the computer fouls you by 5 or 6 times, and nerfed user steals/teammate steals (the training where you just hold down the user defend button took me 5 times to make silver.  On the 4 of 6 scenario, my teammate could not steal the ball even though it was a mostly straight ahead steal).The Game needed to be harder than last year, but getting fouled constantly isn't fun.  They still don't call many fouls.  It's just the AI fouls so much that there is an increase in what is called.   I've switch to the boring one touch passing from end to end(only way to reliably advance the ball) and the AI still usually finishes the game with 4 or 5 yellow cards.  Also, be ready for slide tackles.  The CPU dives constantly.  They've also increased CPU recovery.  So if you beat your man, you may get one unhindered dribble(no guarantee's) before he's slide tackling you again.You have to pretty much always one touch shot as well.  If not the AI will foul you (its never called inside the box....EVER) causing an animation reset, and they will continue to do it until you lose the ball.  The only way to get a penatly called in the box is to skill move.  In about 30 games I've got 2 penalty kicks, both from doing the Ronaldo chop inside the box.Volley's are almost the only way to score lofted through balls.  The slow down on touch is so much, that even a 5-6 step lead will see the cpu steal the ball after a good frist touch.  Even regular through balls suffer from this.They've basically turned the game into a one touch passing game.  You can still win most of the time on superstar doing it, but its boring boring boring.PES 2016 was my first PES. It turned me into a big PES fan.  PES 2017 turned me into a big FIFA 17 fan.			"

												** It's a shame I bought it from a 3rd party website so It's impossible to get a refund... **/////I'm a Liverpool fan.And since Liverpool FC is licensed in 'PES 2017' I bought it to support my team even though many people tried to warn me how sh*t it is on PC.And now I'm regret buying it....Graphics so sh*t, so 20 years ago. I remember playing older versions of PES on PC but graphics are a lot better than this one. KONAMI totally insulting us PC gamers.In the past I used to choose PES over FIFA because of the same reason. FIFA had no love for PC gamers while PES was going into the next generation.But since  'FIFA 13'  EA did a great job for introducing Next-gen graphics, especially this year with Frostbite engine on PC. While the PC version of PES is getting worse in terms of graphics, at least not going anywhere.I'm not going to get into the gameplay stuffs because such graphics deserve no justice no matter how good the game is. We just can't allow this sh*t to go on..But I suggest not buying any games of KONAMI from now on. I really wanna see them bankrupt because this game is totally overpriced.....TLDR >>> *** If you really wanna play PES then get it on PS4 or Xbox. ***Sry for my bad English.			"

A bit of a shame I have to search for it.I'm a fan of PES but on my X1 (PES2016) looked way better. :/			"

												I will recommend the game but with the caveat that you're ready to be frustrated for most of your time playing it. Let's start with the positives:+The  modding community is and likelty always will be the lifeblood of the PES series. The ability and dedication to mod in kits, faces, stadiums, and leagues is what keeps PES alive and competing with FIFA.+The player likeness and the chants for the few teams that are licensed are spot on+The gameplay is a bit more indepth than FIFA, as per usual, and you have the freedom to make a wide range of tactical choices on the fly or before the gameNow then, for the negatives:-The PC version is an absolute horrendous port from a last gen system. I don't even know who thought that was a good idea or why, however most of the amazing screenshots you see on google come from the PS4. The PC version looks like a high end PS2 port, even with graphic upgrades like SweetFX and Reshade.-The off-the-ball AI leaves something top be desired. Unless you are directly controlling the player, they play like idiots. Unless its Neymar or Ronaldo, the AI will not beat its marker and at times will stop mid run and just watch the ball. When mixed with whacky pass tracking, be prepared for a lot of frustration as there's a 50% chance the play you wanted and the play you get will be two different things.-Online play is horrendous and that's often a huge letdown for anybody playing any sports game ever.Really, even after all of its faults its still an enjoyable game. But the oft asked question every year is, ""FIFA or PES?""And this year, FIFA delivered a better product and we can only hope Konami will learn going forward and correct their mistakes. Another PES release as lackluster as this could well see the series slip into rough waters.			"

												Hi all,After 3 hours off me playing with game's settings and graphic's card settings i managed to get a decent FPS for the game but i still  get some lag in game. This is a shame for a game with medium quality graphics and given the recommended specs. I have an i5 4590, GTX 460, 8GB RAM and a Kingston SSD hard disk!!!.Note that I can play fifa 17 demo with no issues.This shows that KONAMI does not care at all about the PC version compatibility.They may have tested it with a PC they have at their office and that is all.Do not buy this game. Big mistake from me.Virtua Striker 2 is better from this joke. Movement of players is still ROBOTIC at a rate of 20% of total animations, player models slide all the time on the pitch.The ONLY THING that this games does ok is the shooting and crossing.			"

You can check my video on the game delay and make a judgment on your own, i bought the game to play vs others and leagues but it turns out they do not care about that for PC players and PC players don't play online in response since it's so bad and in turn there arent many people online at times.Not worth buying for online play. The game itself is awesome when played offline.			"

												I have not yet played online, and will never do so, I just don't like online play with sports games. So this review is on the game as a whole. It's a good game, better than FIFA, improved several things, such as minor tweeks to gameplay, the goalie's are smarter, more competent and so one, and the AI is no longer a complete joke on the lower difficulties, or even on higher ones as they were in past games. The graphics, since the last game I played was 2014, have improved significantly since then. The animations, and over all feel of realism are great too. Now for some of the cons. The creation system, or rather lack there of (Yes there is one, but it's not good). You don't have nearly as much diversity with several things, like hairstyles, sliders (are non-existent), and it lacks in many other forms. On top of all that, the team customization is pretty bad too, lacks a lot of content that was there in the past, can't do as much with it anymore, and for me these few cons are massive because I LOVE customization in games. While as a soccer game it's good, not quite worth 40 bucks, but still worth getting, but not enough for me to say it's a definite buy.			"

I feel that's got to change if games are being made for DX12 or 11 then why can't this? If this were MGS:V I feel more love would be in this.I think the graphics could be improved with just a texture download... for the pitch, players, and stadiums. The gameplay is actually... amazing compared to fifa I was satisfied after I got over my initial gripe. For a first time PES owner since 2004... it's good. Just... I wish this port was made with us in mind. We are such a big community and we deserve that love as if we were a console like the Xbox and Playstation. Konami, I know you don't normally do well with PC ports but I look at MGS and thought DAMN you nailed the port.... give us that quality on something as important as FOOTBALL!			"

												Another year, another PES, another heartbreaking disappointment.Like the team you love who seems poised for greatness at beginning of the season, only to choke at the vital moments, PES gets so much right, but what it gets wrong ruins the whole package.Pros:- Out-of-the-box graphics are terrible, no team licenses, etc. All this is easily fixed with patches. I recommend PTE Patch. I honestly don't know why Konami wastes money on licensing. All of that content is provided by the community.- Dribbling is pretty OK, I guess.Cons:- You don't get to play the game. If you like games like Final Fantasy, where you put one finger up your nose, and then chose moves from a menu, you'll like playing PES. It's a lot like that. - Passing is atrocious. This is what kills the game. There is NO, I repeat NO ACTUAL MANUAL passing mode. You CANNOT just kick the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ball and then run your player into it. Even if you make a good pass on full manual controls, the game will decide you suck, and don't DESERVE to make the pass, and your player will run away from the ball, away from where you are pressing the control stick and let the ball go to the opposition.- Defending is a crapshoot. You do not get to decide which player to control, you do not get to decide how the player you ARE ""controlling"" moves. You are too stupid to leave these decisions in your hands, so Konami does it for you. Dumb‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•I've come to accept that a decent soccer sim will simply NEVER exist. Don't look for it, be happy with what you've got, which is a clunky, inelegant contrived POS.			"

												I'm pretty disapointed with the game. I played demo on PS4 and it felt awesome, improvements in every field and extremely fun. Since it's pretty expensive there, I decided to buy it for PC and it's not the same game at all. This is bad port from console with everything good removed. It's slow, unresponsive and sluggish. Very easy to score a goal since every shot is the same, no matter which player is shooting. Keepers are a bit better than last year, but still pretty bad. Through balls are OP like every year, sometimes you just need to press triangle and Auba, Walcott or anyone fast will be released into one on one with keeper. I don't even want to start about playing online. I have to wait 5 minutes to find a game, then it connects me with someone few ranks better or worse from me. It often lags (probably because of cheaters) people that are losing are exploiting the game like pressing the pause to the limit or making ridicolous fauls. I really expected game more similar to console one and if I got that it would be better than Fifa. This way, sorry Konami, you failed one more time.			"

												My honest review:Although I am a big fan of FC Bayern M√ºnchen and it's a huge loss that the team is completely unlicensed this year, but I would still say that Pes 2017 is the best football game that Konami has ever made since the days of ""winning eleven 3"" and ""Pes 6"" for many reasons: (taking into consideration that I only play offline exhibition matches)Note: before you start evaluating the game and make snap judgments you have to spend some time first playing it, as the more you play the game the more magic you will explore..1. Gameplay: smooth with zero lag, quick player reaction, less bugs than ever before, no random ball physics or silly player collisions, accurate passing system, improved ball crossing and lofted balls, beautiful through balls which can now be achieved from any area on the field, goalkeepers quick reaction with new impressive animations, adaptive AI makes gameplay against CPU much more interesting and creative, Referee decisions are more accurate and strict, improved free kicks and new corner kick strategies2. Graphics: player models and motions look identically the same as in PS4 with minor differences in texture, The turf color looks greener and better than last year (only in day time matches), New beautiful net shapes and edit options, Animated stadium staff, Kits colors look more authentic and less cartoonish than last year, menus move smoother with a pleasant look.3. Sound effects: minor enhancements like the nets when hit by the ball or when the ball deflected off the goalie's gloves, minor enhancements in crowd chants, improved referee whistle.The major differences between PC version and 8th generation consoles version:As the Pc Pes 2017 is a hybrid version of 2 different platforms the following graphic elements are not available for pc gamers which is kind of disappointing:1. Weather effects: rain splash, wet grass and wet goal nets, breath vapor of the players in cold weather.2. high quality turf texture.3. Lifelike crowd texture.4. As many stadiums as the console versions.5. Referee vanishing spray.6. Motion of the players uniforms.7. Realistic night lightening.8. Digital animated adboards.9. External stadium view.10. New special celebration.However, As PC gamers we are so grateful that Pes 2017 runs smoothly on almost every modern or mid-age PC unlike other football games which require massive hardware abilities and yet gameplay is still laggy, moreover PC users can run the game at maximum graphic settings and the game will look even better than how it looks on 8th generation consoles,Therefore if you want to enjoy gameplay at the maximum graphic settings without having to worry about frame rate and laggy motion which spoil gameplay I recommend running the game at 1280x720 resolution only.Not forgetting that we have enough space to freely create and modify our teams on PC, Overall, PC game is worth it if we compare it to it's low price, as If you enjoy how football played on the pitch Pes 2017 is definitely the game of your choice, and if you enjoy how football looks on TV go for another game.

												My last favorite PES was 2010 stopped playing after that. I have solid reasons to stop. Long time ago it was fun and no one cares about graphics except gameplay . But they dive in a realism pool and sadly they lost that legendary gameplay factor. I'm ok with realism tries can forget about gameplay if game is smooth about simulation&realism BUT KONAMI at least release this game with full LICENCES. There are a strong rival and their graphics much better with full licences plus better online features. Tried play this game but dissapointed because of gameplay and graphics sux, online laggy as hell. - Faces very good better than FIFA- Animations good better than FIFA- Gameplay not good but realistic than FIFA- Graphics, cinematic scenes poor, FIFA much better about them- Fake teams annoying- Online side is terrible- My club, Master League good - Playing agaisnt Super Star level AI really annoying something wrong about AI- If you have previous version you don't need to buy this because not much differenceOverall if you're not a crazy fan about this game just don't buy. I would recommend you FIFA 2017			"

												I've recently been converting over to PC gaming, and have had nothing bad to say about it to my console-centric friends. That is, until I bought PES on steam. I was a fool to not realise that all the glowing reviews were about the console version. A quick google now (too late) tells me the pc port is a dumbed down, ugly hybrid ps3-ps4 game. Really quite disappointed			"

												new year new PES new script. This year they scripted crosses so u just have to run down sides and cross in box and watch fancy cinematics with striker gets fast like Barry Allen (Flash) and scores. U cant defend that its just scripted.PES always had player morals in arrows, up red arrow for fantastic and blue down arrow for terrible, now we have some fancy american letters. Confusing.PES always had red numbers for higher ratings, like 90+ red, yellow for ratings like 80 and now its totally different and opposite. Green means great and red numbers means terrible. So black balls are green and white all red. Confusing.Shi*ty Online servers, connections etc. "

												Ahh... What to say? Better than 2016 version, sure. Still, not quite what I hoped.PES 2017 corrects a lot of mistakes that were created by its predecessor. Still, I feel like the 2014, 2015 versions were better (and let's not talk about other titles).This game, hasn't improved much in graphics and sounds. Has improved in menus, team organization, update system (but still very annoying to wait minutes for the game to start sometimes when the internet connection is not reliable), IA (and there are many disturbing moments where the players just don't want to get the ball) and player movement.The ""Become a Legend"" and ""Master League"" modes have received some modifications, appearing to have less things then previous versions and to be more scripted than never. Just not so amazing as it used to be.So, between positive and negative things, the game is still losing his magic. In the end, I think this version is at least playable (previous one wasn't), and so you should try.Need to say that I haven't played online multiplayer (only local).6/10			"

												I bought this game cheap for pc , but I have been playing it on ps4 because its easier to update the kits etc.I had just started my second season on the master league when I figured out that this game is scripted trash.Essentially it works on a plus minus system. For example if your team has players that are rated 80+ overall and you play an ai team with an average of 70+ then the ai will boost its players ability to equal your side. Which completely destroys the balance of the game and totally negates buying players. For example thanks to the games stupid transfer system I over hauled liverpools first team and added some quality to the side (w'ont bore you with names)and instead of seeing any improvement the side became worse and the ai got even more ridiculous in it's out right cheating the ai defenders have super human blocking abilities and there anticipation is jedi like, there tackling in the area is so good it makes maldini look scholes. My advice to anyone that has gotten fed up with fifa's antics is to play this game then go back to fifa and you will appreciate it alot more. For everyone else avoid at all costs its garbage.			"

												It would be a great game if not for three things:- online lag,- scripting/handicapping,- lack of defensive control.Even when you accept the fact that there's scripting/handicapping and that it's extremely hard to control your defenders when the ball comes to their feet (they'll turn and lose the ball all the time and it can't be helped), there's lag to remind you that Konami isn't capable of making a decent online game in 2016. To sell this game at full price, with a broken online, is a fraud.  "

												Yes, this Version is not on par with the PS4 and X1 Versions. And I'm‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•about that, too.BUT once you get over that fact, you're left with a great football game nonetheless.Best football-gameplay I have played to date. I am an offline-player at heart so I can't really review online aspects (keep that in minde, please). Is it more or less an upgrade to last years game? - Of course it is! It's an annual sports game so what does one expect. But it's a good update. Once your on the pitch, it's as fun as ever. Gameplay is crisp and smooth. Intuitive but still a lot to learn over time.MasterLeague has gotten some tweaks - mostly minor ones, sure, but they make sense and they do enhance your expierence from last years game. Especially the transfersystem, while not plain bad, could use some more effort in terms of realism, though.Review the game from a technical standpoint and yeah, you'll be dissapointed. There's no denying that and I will not try to justify the gimped version PC-Players get. But it's not ""like playing PS2"" either, as I came to read a lot.Once you get over it and if PC is the only option when you're looking for (videogame)football, I can not not reccomend the game! It's just too much fun despite it's flaws - and they are there. Don't get me wrong.Gamemodes could and should be presented in a more exciting way. The game might end up beeing maybe a little bit to easy once you're at certain level. Stadium atmosphere isn't very good. Gameplay could be tweaked a little here and there. And of course graphics should be better. Still, those points can't put down my overall enjoyment with PES2017.As I'm writing this I am over a hundred hours gametime. Most games that cost more, you usually end up playing not half as much. Just give it a try and I'm sure most players will find themselves liking it a lot in spite of all the negativity in this review section. So go find a community patch, get out on that virtual pitch and play some football!TL;DR:Ignore the hate, get the game and have lots of fun. It's a great football game.			"

												Not Recommended, the game was built under the Fox Engine, same as Metal Gear Solid V, a AAA game which had the most perfect PC port since day-one, but Konami managed to screw it up, game looks like PS3/X360 port. On PS4 and Xbox One the game looks just amazing, lots of features for graphics, same as MGSV, but on PC, they didn't give a damm about it. I bought on GK4A, and cannot get a refund because I used a key to activate.Article as proof: http://www.tweaktown.com/news/53991/pes-2016-totally-crap-pc-looks-better-ps4/index.htmlAnd video comparing PC vs. PS4 vs. XBONE:

												What a shame !! Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 is a series of game that developed for many years, but it is still far away from calling a Soccer game. It is not simply changing the interface, the layout of the contents, the background colour, but is to keep upgrading the engine until it playing like a REAL soccer game. And, after several years of development, what is in this game? I can say nothing.First, the camera views provide many choices but none of the camera meet the standard or suit the game; especially when I am playing Be a Legend mode. In this mode, I just control 1 player, but the camera always loss of control, it followed the ball without sense, my player is showed somewhere at the bottom of the pitch, the icon in the radar is not clear, I don't really know how to go back to my position. Next, the camera is following my player, but it does not turn the angle to follow my player, when I change in direction in a suddent, the camera may sometimes fade out. Then, the camera along the sideline giving a better view of the whole pitch, but it makes me hard to control my player, especially the he is running along the sideline far from the camera, player becomes too small. Can I have a camera that placed behind the goal, at high level, which gives a wider view of the pitch?OK ! Let's move to the gameplay. I am playing Central Midfield, and I keep lossing the ball in the midfield; poor first touch, unlawful tackle, strong muscle...etc. which always result in 2-5 players falling on the floor and fighting for the ball. It is unbelievable !! I don't know why the A.I. team can tackle my ball easily, YES ! I am playing ""professional"" level, but it cannot be such easy, right? The A.I. team just simply crazy !! Deadly tackle (in any situation) and deadly through ball (my defender simply let the A.I. player gets the ball in front of his face). These TWO major bugs really destory the game !Next, my player has been sent off for many time. Got yellow cards for a easy tackle, sometimes red cards for sliding tackle....but the A.I. team, when he did the same against my team, is not foul at all !!!How could you publish such a rubbish gameplay engine? I used 8 hours to play nearly 1 season in Be a Legend mode, and I think it is enough !! Don't wanna play such rubbish game anymore !!!			"

												The gameplay got better from 2016. But referees are way, way worse. Transfer system is completely f***ed up. Before this version, you can at least continue to negotiate with 5 players even if there are finished negotioations. now finished negotiations use up your 5 negotiation quota. That' s ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t. It was bad but bearable before. Now it' s idiotic and meaningless. Gameplay is better but the game speed and the speed computer passes are completely unrealistic. They' re only there to irritate you, take your gaming pleasure away. Every team is passing like Barcelona, running like Real Madrid. When u got a bad team for a startup in ml, you will get furious in minutes. And please don't get me started about  tackles, which you always loose or get a yellow card. 'cause every sliding tackle is a yellow card. theese are all valid for superstar difficulty Konami is f***ing with pc players thorough all these years. I understand they can' t have the licenses. But on PC they  can at least make the transfer system a little bit realistic. It's 2016 and you can't get multiple offers for a player! You can't sign two players on the same time on the last day. Come on, is this an experiment on us?Don'T get this if you're meaning to play a long ml career with a 3rd party patch. It's completely f***ud up.Get FIFA for that purpose. That's what i'm gonna do.Shame on you konami.  "

												awful PC port, if you play the game under the hardest difficulty you might have fun, but if you play on PES's version of Legendary, you will have a bad time. scripting is as bad as FIFA, extremely sluggish movement makes fluid gameplay near impossible, and the regen/transfer/tactics system is all pretty damn bad. I would highly suggest skipping PES/FIFA until one of them can make a good one. pray FM17 is good			"

												Worst football game I've ever seen.Konami still suckers for AI vs Player design and it shows worse here than any other PES game. The AI is so garbage I feel the need to question whether or not the designer have ever played football. Your team struggles to maintain formation integrity. Man marking is a joke. No Zone control or defense  and everything is basically forced to let the player make up for the lack-of.I don't know why there is such an elaborate tactical design on formation and squad control, when it NEVER is applied in an actual match.Referee's are completely ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dense and are always biased in favor of the AI, (because how else will it make up for how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing easy it is to win the ball). Apparently so long as you make a sliding tackle it really doesn't matter if your attempt to win the ball (before making any contact with the player) is successful or not.so long as your an offensive player, the game will always look at it from a leaniant perspective that a defending player should be allowed to make moves like that, but a centre forward gets red carded on a sliding tackle where he won the ball and did not make any harsh contact with the player, slid from the side, TRAPPED THE BALL and was red carded. The design is obviously biased to suggest that a CF should not be allowed to make tackles on defenders because, if play continued... it's an easy attempt at goal. Apparently nobody likes a football game when its very easy.Goal Keeper control is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and is always slow reaction based.Unless you directly assume control of the goal keeper, he'll never do anything intelligent until he has to react. I.e. shot on goal, passed directly too keeper etcLoose balls, Narrow corner kicks and sometimes last man runs, Goal keepers are inclined to stay on their line.There's no AI based attitude to get a desired effect where the goal keeper will make their own decision.BUT HEY! LET'S REDESIGN THE FLIP FLAP... BECAUSE EVERYBODY LIKES AWESOME DRIBBLING SKILLSTo conclude, this game faulters where every top tier football game does. And fails to see the bigger picture.There's a lot more to a football game than a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing retard who can dribble well, however Konami seem to like to add mechanics of dynamic dribbling, and discard functions such as, on the ball player command/interaction. I mean I can't even ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing direct somebody to make a run, and ironically enough they never do it themselves.I mean, have the developers of the game even looked at their own ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game? Play the game, play the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game PLEASE, take possession of the ball, and dribble for a while. Now, watch your midfield. Watch them, just watch them.THEY'RE DOING NOTHING. Do you not realize that mid fielders and defenders still have active roles EVEN WHEN YOU'RE IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL?Do you not think that holding the D-Line in an aggressive scenario is still maintained even when you have possession of the ball?Do you not think that the team should MAINTAIN FORMATION at times?You cannot seriously think factors like zone control and formation integrity is maintained only when you don't have possession of the ball.Mid fielders never cut off space, or control open zones. I mean, it's like you think Zone defense is something completely different. I just don't understand.Please, learn football before you make a football game.And fix your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t Ronaldhino syndrome! "

												This should be named: Pro Evolution Sliding, or Injury Simulator.Seriously, I can live with the downgrade graphic. The gameplay overall is good. But AI rediculously use sliding in every situation, most of the cases are totally unnecessary, not to mention they use it at the back of my player, which deserves a red card in real life. And since I bought this game, not even a single red card is draw for the AI. What the hell ? Right from the first match of the season, my striker is injured becase of sliding. In the next match I lost another one. Now whenever I play this game, I have to watch my players fall down like 20 times in a single match. Totally not recommended unless you want to train your frustration.******Updated review:Well, online is‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• offline is unfair. Can't find any match online. In offline mode, you simply have to play against cheating AI and stupid referee. You players will play under his condition whenever you lead a goal, and then you will lose because of stupid goals. And about the referee, well, he's your enemy, the AI tackle you 5 times, 1 yellow card, 2 of your players are injured.  You do the same 5 times, 4 yellow card, 1 red card. Not to mention about the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•input lag, even I only play in offline mode, it makes you hardly control your players because every action is delayed 0.2-0.5 seconds. Try to find anything good about this game in more than 50 hours, but all I can see is frustration. However, it is quite fun when you play with your friends (2 controllers offline, because online is‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.If you have a brother or a friend whom you enjoy to play with him in offline mode. Go ahead and use pirate version. Otherwise, you should still use pirate version. There is no good to spend money on this game.			"

												I've been waiting for a long time to make a decision on Pro. I was a little disappointed about PC gamers yet again getting Xbox 360/ps3 graphics but decided to put that aside due to the gameplay. I don't really mind that it doesn't have all the licenses because that's not really what's important. Just so long as the gameplay is still there.I decided to get the game, anyways as I loved PES 16 and I have to say, I am massivly disappointed. PES 16 was nearly perfect in terms of gamplay so I thought it could only get better since they had the blueprint for the gameplay. But no The keepers aren't any better. It's much slower and the worst thing is the dribbling. Its absolutely dire! Whenever you get the ball, it's nearly impossible to get past anyone. Alos it's impossible to sheild the ball at all leaving you completely exposed and helpless when opposition take the ball from you. I know that FIFA is more about dribbling but ya need to be able to do some dribbling in an football game.As a result, I am done with PES. I trusted them regardless of getting constantly ripped off and been fooled once again. I cannot see how anyone who played 16 think that 17 is better in terms of gameplay.2/10			"

												PROS:-ML is the mother‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•en bomb-MyClub mode is interesting, but kinda like master league light. great if you like playing online. -Gameplay is fantastic-Graphics really aren't that bad, especially with some mods installedCONS:-MyClub mode relies too much on randomness. Or you can buy your way to a good squad, but that's kinda cheating.-Bugs bugs bugs. Especially in Master League. -Every time Konami releases a new Datapack it seems to mess up player editing. Especially annoying if you install after-market patches like the PTE patch or PESGalaxy patch. Gotta restart master league every time.WARNING: If Konami release a new Datapack and you don't want to restart master league, unplug your computer from the internet so it can't connect before starting Steam. and then start Steam in offline mode. Just means you'll have to do that every time, and can never update the game again unless you wanna restart master league.			"

												I don't know why people keep talking about gameplay. I've been playing PES since the beginning and I know when I'm being forced to play a certain way and in 17 that concept is stronger than ever. Players are still running into one another, passing options are still just as limited as any previous edtion, if not moreso. The AI closes you down in true Benny Hill fashion and time and time again the control of my players at crucial times suddenly becomes inconsistent i.e. double tapping run will suddenly not work, players will take another touch, players will do some silly trick I never executed, or (my favourite) one, or two, of your players will run into you - OR the AI will just throw players into you, or you'll be slightly thrown off balance enough for AI to retrieve the ball (de'ja vu?). So overall, PES 17 is a bit of a step back or if I was forced into being more positive I'd say its really just well concealed stagnation because nothing really has changed and if anything the play has actually gotten worse or at least the amount of AI tunnelling - though this doesn't happen all the time, just 90% so during the other 10% when you're actually allowed to play it's good and then it all looks and feels good but sadly that doesnt happen too often and so when the AI turns the tap off you're left fighting with all the same old problems of the previous versions and if you have any sort of self-respect or are over the age of 10 you'll really get frustrated, for surely you want your mistakes to be your own right?To sum it up, PES 17 feels like it is suffering from split personality, almost as if it were two games locked in one. On one hand, when playing competivetly 90% of the time, you end up in the struggle (see above) which is bad, really bad/ but on the other hand, the other 10% of the time, its a great game, a real joy to play. Sadly the odds are stacked against it.IF YOU CBA READING ABOVE.... When AI puts the foot down it's a horrible nightmare of automated-conformity      --> 5/10 but when the AI enforcement is lifted it becomes a great game, flowing well and looking good--> 8/10Problem is for the most part, particuarly if you play competitively, you end up with the first scenario for most of the time.Let's just hope an update/patch sorts some of that out because we seem to be right back to square one here in fact I hate to say it but it feels like (old) FIFA - yuk!Just take away the restrictions Konami need to let us all play the way we want all of the time!

It is as dead as it was when PES 2010 came out.Whether this is because EA bought all the good Konami people I don't know.All I know is that PES 2017 must not even be named in the same sentence as FIFA 17. It is that much worse.The interface, the loading times, the 'checking network connectivity' messages, the graphics, the delayed gameplay, the controls, the feeling for the ball, the just-about-everything - it's all so shoddy compared to FIFA 17. Hell, it's shoddy compared to FIFA 15.I used to be someone who got FIFA players to try PES, back in the good old days.Now, I just wish I hadn't wasted EUR 25,- in buying this game (via a website that offers gamekeys for cheaper, which of course denies you the right to get your money back).Oh well, lesson learned, never again.Pro Evolution Soccer is dead.

												opiubragpih...this is the most frustrating sports game I've ever played.As far as football games go, I've purchased a FIFA game every few years and occasionally played WEPES with friends who have purchased it.  This is the first time I have gotten it for myself.My god is this a bad sports game!  It might possibly be very fun, but I have no idea how to do anything!  I have done every training, watched tons of youtube videos, and played several seasons of master league...but I still don't understand how to do the most basic of things: win a header, shoot towards the goal, have my teammates NOT run away from a pass.  It's insanely frustrating.  I've fiddled with every menu, every setting, and tried every tactic, but if I play as Real Madrid vs the English 3rd division I am forced to watch Ronaldo get outpaced by Sunday league defenders while chasing a through ball, Modric get run over from behind and stripped of the ball whilst trying to process the ""pass button"" command that has stymied the great thinkers of our time, and seen my hapless goalkeeper stand by aimlessly as braindead midfielders rocket screaming dippers into the far corner from 50 yards out.Im 60 hours in at this point and I give up.  I want to be clear that I bought this game specifically for the offline gameplay.  I don't care about the graphics, the menus and layout don't matter to me, I almost never play online, I just wanted to play a ""realistic"" football game.  This is not that.  This game is very *complicated*, but it's just not football.  This seems like it might be a good game for someone who is a long time player of WEPES.  For a relative newcomer, it makes slamming my head into a pile of bricks sound like an enjoyable afternoon.			"

												Best football game ever made. However, you need to sort out two things;1-) The game has framerate issues when played fullscreen. But it runs smoothly when played windowed. To sort this out, you need to install a software called ""windowed borderless gaming"". Then you start the game in windowed mode, using the software you can play it like fullscreen.2-) Many teams are unlicensed. I think everyone knows there are plenty of patches for this out there.Cons:- Graphics could have been betterPros:- Pretty much everything else			"

												After playing more than 90 hours of this game,I ended up with some pros and cons of this year's PES.First of all lets start with the pros:1.Player Faces:Probably one of the best aspects of Konami's game.The player facec look really awesome!I was really impresed with them when I saw them.Most of the players have really accurate,realistic-looking faces Definitely a big plus for that.2.Gameplay:It is really smooth and nice.You can really feel the smoothness and the fast response of the game.Also,the management aspect is really good.You can play with every tactic yoy want,and feel  dicference between them.Plus,it is really satisfying to score a goal in PES.3.Manager Mode (Master League):I personally am a fan of Become a Legend,which is a Player Career,but this year the Manager Mode got my interest.It is really fun and well maded.It is realistic and satysfying,but sometime I felt like the progress was made a bit faster than it should be,but hey,not everyone want to build their team around for ages.4.Player Mode (Become a Legend):As I said above,Im a big BAL fan.So I can definitely tell you something about this mode.It hasnt changed too much since PES 2016,but it doesnt mean that its not good.It is really good.The only new ""crucial"" thing that I think about,is that they added the option to change your shirt number (FINALLY) something that we wanted like  years from the developersNow lets talk about some cons:1.My Club:To be honest,I tried to find an opponent for like an hour and I didnt find NO ONE..and yes,I changed the search settings..but maybe that was just me on that one.2Graphics:They definitely made a mistake giving us the old xbox 360 engine...like come on guys its 2016,we are bored of bad looking games (especially football games).I hope to see a new enginw in the next PES game,no doubt.3.Licenses:Of course,like every year,we want some bigger leaguea in the game.But hey its not their fault..Its all about the Konami vs EA war.OVERALL:If you are a football fan that doesnt worry too much for the graphics and wants to have a good time making tactis,tiki taka passes etc etc and also doest care so much about the online part of the game I can definitely recommend it :)			"

												It is much worse than PES 2016 where you could actually enjoy playing the game. This‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•doesn't have anything with enjoyment, you can see that if you check my play hours on PES 2016 and on this‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Their slogan is control reality but you can't control‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• only thing you can control is when you will open and exit the game, you don't have control over anything else because players don't do what you tell them and when you tell them.So yeah don't buy it, I feel sorry that I bought it and feel like I wasted money, this is the last PES I will ever buy, I'm fed up with konamis'‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•			"

												I have learned that PES 17 has so much errors that it has a unique code for each! Like an OS!Anyway, at almost every live update, I have encountered a problem and have to google the code and watch videos for solutions, again and again and again. Well, it is the end of the line for me.I have just bought Fifa 17 and so far, it is going well. At least, the game have never crashed and stabile for the moment.			"

												Fantastic!!! I've never played better soccer game from PES 6! :)Evrybody who complains on graphics, licences etc.....you should not take seriously that I am pretty old soccer fan an I own all PES series  and olmost all FIFA series.And I can say this is one of best soccer simulation off all time!Amaizing gamplay (the crossing, shooting, passing, ball controlling, almost everything received improvement) !!Ofcourse I can complain on online matches and graphics but this is for me minor things.Honestly who cares about graphics when you play soccer game and you use Wide camera or whatever and player  is inch size on screen.Licences will fix PES fans Patches like PES Galaxy Patch etc...And only what we can complain is online matches maybe in future we will have great performance instead of lag matches I hope so.I  recommend this game as support to developers on PES series because they deserve this with new PES 2017!

												Let me tell you this, if you gonna play with AI. **** YOU KONAMI! Say what, the AI is ****ing stupidly OP. They can stop you at any position, at any ****ing time, run faster than you even you are holding Messi 90+ Speed and the other guy is some unknown player with 70=< Speed. And players do ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• stuff that BIOLOGICALLY AND PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE, shooting position, blocking position, how can you even do a blocking or shooting in an instant after you drop down from the air immediately? KUNG-****ING-FU? Can you make it more FAKE?When I was in a counter attack, I was having Messi in the middle ran for his life with the ball to the goal and POOF, the mother****er who was from the very wing ran to Messi and pushed him away like an easy job, no foul, outside the box, like ""I'm Usain Bolt and Messi is crap"" (Messi is one of the highest Speed stat! Same thing with Bale, Ronaldo, Bellerin, Hazard,etc.). And while you're defending your field, the AI got the ball, the AI ran faster than your defenders even the AI were behind you. I would say **** YOU KONAMI.When the AI touch you, you are stunned or fell, can't continue to take the ball, when I touch the AI, the AI is like a ****ing HULK ""nobody can stop me""????When the AI touch the ****ing ball from the air with awkward position in a 1v1 air fight, it will be definitely 99% the ball will drop to the AI's player without the player running or changing position. Even when you touch the ball in the 1v1 air fight in a comfort position, probably 2/3 chance the AI get the ball effortlessly without running or challenging!How the **** can I return this‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I better play FIFA 2017, was PES fan since 06 now this is‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I quit PES.

You have to take the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing responsibility and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing deal with the cheaters! Plus you have to compensate such losses for the ones who are wasting time on such incidents. As you are not making the game fair, you are provoking people to cheat so that they can reimburse what they lose.

												Pes 2017 is one of the best footbal games of the world. I dont say that because I dont like Fifa or other game but this game is so different. The new gameplay with the possesion game can make you to win every hard game. Trust me , I was little indiferent when my friends tell me about this game possesion but now I totaly understand why they like so much this gameCarrier mode its now more interesting than the others pes games because right now the values of the players are verry exactly , and the buget of the team its perfect. Every difficulty its now right , and if you play a lot of time this game you will give me juistice.Graphics are verry beauty , and every player has a verry real face.I have only one reason that makes me unhappy. The skills moves are not many so you have to use them √Æn rare cases.So if you want to pay 20 euro for this game I recommend you with pleasure.I hope I helped you to choose the good decision  ;)			"

												I'm playing this game since ISS2. In my opinion PES 2013 was the best football game. Since PES 2014, they changed the engine of the game. I didn't like at all PES 2014 or PES 2016, the physics were very bad regarding the ball, goalkeepers, player movement, etc... In this version I see a huge physics improvement and this is what matters in a simulator game. I'm playing this game on -2 game speed. Hope the next games will be by default on -1 or -2 game speed because right now the default speed is very fast compared to reality.The online experience is very bad. You can't control the players like you do it in offline mode and the speed of the payers/ball is not from this planet.This game is fantastic! (Offline of course with friends and CPU)			"

												Bom dia. Sou f√£ a franquia desde quando ela nem se chamava Pro Evolution Soccer, mas nos ultimos 4 anos s√≥ tenho me decepcionado. Adquiri o PES 17 no ano passado logo no lan√ßamento e a primeira decep√ß√£o vem com a n√£o aquisi√ß√£o de direitos de imagem de diversos times e jogadores. A segunda decep√ß√£o √© com o modo ONLINE. Tenho uma internet de excelente qualidade com 50MBs e nem com isso o servidor da Konami d√£o conta do recado. A resposta dos comando tem um atraso de resposta muito grande, a intelig√™ncia artificial dos jogadores √© horrivel. Com isso o que determina quem vai vencer uma partida no modo online n√£o √© a habilidade do jogador, mas sim quem ter√° menos problemas com o servidor. Como forma de protesto, eu n√£o irei insistir em dar novas chances h√° konami e comprar o PES nos proximos anos. Pelo contr√°rio, e ainda irei comprar o seu principal concorrente ( que por sinal est√° bem melhor em nos principais aspectos). Lamento que a franquia tenha entrado nessa decadencia.  "

												First, I played mostly offlien and played few games online.If you liked PES 2016 or you like football, you will love this game. The gameplay is just awesome and is an improvement compared to PES 2016. If just feels right when you play. The way players and the ball  move is reallistic. I do not regret buying it at all.They added more stats, interace is better. There are more tactics you can set.95% of bad reviews are from people that find the game too difficult. Some find it ugly ==> You are on PC. Go download patches (pes-patch.com). You will have all missing players, sponsors, faces, kits, names. You can add stadiums, turfs, scoreboard, real commentaries, chants...If you love football this is the best game you can buy.			"

												I played Winning Eleven alot in the PS2 days, now with some days in bed, I decided to give a chance to this PES2017 for the good old days, and I'm sad to see what become of the franchise.The game tries to capture everything that's wrong in football, who is interested in players slipping on rainy days? Players who do not control the ball? Players who dive in every contact? Games stopped by fouls all the time?Since when that players from big clubs are the only capable of scoring goals? While players from small clubs are unable to beat a goalkeeper in 1x1, it reminds me of the commercial view of FIFA.I'm sad to revisit a game that I played so much and see that they have lost the feeling of football (soccer) simulators.

												After playing 50 hrs of PES 2017 I can surely tell it is the best football game i've ever played gameplaywise. The gameplay looks so original. also Myclub is very addictive and online is less laggy than last yeaar and completely playable. Myclub campaigns are also very much fantastic as well as the new scout auction system and use 3 scouts in a spin. For the feature of using more than one scout gives us the chance of our choiced player. So this year PES 2017 is complete addictive package.			"

												Best PES in years!There's still some things needing changed in master league like transfer budget and salary budget being hugely unbalanced. I will often find that after I've bought a player or two that I'm left with a transfer budget of say ¬£1-2 million but I've offloaded a couple of big earners so I have a salary budget of around ¬£20 million. There's no way to say turn some of that salary budget into transfer fees so you're just left with it to spend on free transfers or unattached players, which there aren't many who will command such a salary.The game seriously lacks stadiums, you'll find in master league that playing a season you'll only play in 3-4 stadiums max which is really disappointing. The Emirates is coming soon in a update and I think Anfield as well but I'm not sure. But the stadiums left for selection for unlicensed clubs is really poor. Would be great if Konami put the create a stadium feature back in or at least added 5-6 new stadiums with varying capacity rather than huge 60,000+ stadiums all the time.Graphically there is definitely room for improvement when it comes to the PC version comparisons to PS4 or Xbox One. Konami know this but it's not a game breaker for me. The graphics are perfectly reasonable and if all you worry about is players faces changing with emotion or sweat on the foreheads or if Neymar has plucked his eyebrows, then go play FIFA, but for me gameplay is far more important.Gameplay wise this is definitely one of the best if not the best PES since the times of PES 5 and 6, which back then was the best around. When you put PES and FIFA side by side this year it's a no brainer for me, especially considering PES is available for around ¬£25 and FIFA still commands at least ¬£35 at it's cheapest price.			"

												The gameplay is perfect, it's a fascinating realism. Unique problem is that we are spotted thanks to (or because of) the ""environment network"". Sincerely, I would still play it sometimes this year, and for, I think, every player in the world who plays this version, this can provoke paranoia and street troubles. So I expect PES 2018 to be less ""broadband"" and less broadcasted.Nevertheless, it's a good mood test so, whatever, ok it's kind of good.			"

Difficult to get used to it if you, like myself, come from Fifa or older PES, but once you get used to it it's very rewarding.So i'd say give this PES a try cause I think you'll be positively surprised.

												This is a typical PES release from Konami. The gameplay is great with less pinballing, the features are great per usual, referee and goalie AI feels better than last year. However, just like last year the original release graphics remind me of Fifa 2005.  Fortunately, there are people online who have dedicated time and effort to fix it for you. Be smart by patching it up, and it becomes an excellent game to play with your buddies. I wish Konami gave more of a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•about the PC version but honestly, I'm thankful they still release something solid to compete with EA's FIFA. Enjoy!			"

												It's a shame Konami can't get their act together cuz it's extremely irksome to find the same thing happen over and over again. The last gen port is a downright insult to pc gamers. The gameplay is better than fifa though, but in this day and age we just can't put up with a sports game where the crowd and staff look like paintings. My pc rocks a gtx 970 with fx 8350 and 16gb ram and I have to run a game that has poor aesthetic value. I mean I don't think you'd even need that kinda rig to run the ps4 port. Any decent pc should run it just fine cuz ps4 is a weak system anyway.I gave Konami a chance this year but if this happens again next year I'm gonna quit playing soccer games altogether.			"

												I love PES and in my opinion quite better than FIFA over the last few years I think since 2012 PES has really been the better game but I still suffer the same issue that I don't like playing online (it's laggy) and playing against the AI just isn't difficult enough. Super Star which is the highest level is still like playing against a 5 year old who doesn't know what he's doing.Aside from that, 2017 was a huge leap mechanically, I wish they could actually grab all the licenses for next year though, and bump up the multiplayer into proper servers that don't lag so much.

 Online Issues and Date Corruption Hold Back a Wonderful Game This game is worth your money, don't get me wrong, but if you're looking for a great online experience, I would recommend playing on an X-Box or Playstation. The customer support was actually quite wonderful when I lost my whole Master League (Management Career Mode) file to data corruption, and they re-imbursed all users who experienced the error with in-game money. Pros Great Career Mode Wonderful Gameplay Best Editing Suite in a Football/Soccer Game More Licensed Clubs than Last YearCons Lag Online Game Crashes Date CorruptionOverall, a fun game and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an alternative to ""FIFA 17"" Overall Rating: ****/***** "

												First of all,this port doesn't deserve the hate it gets! It may be graphicaly inferior to the PS4/XboxOne versions,but the gameplay-features-collision engine is exactly the same as in the next gen versions. I played both the PS4 versions and the PS3 one and the PC version is genuinely next-gen quality in the gameplay department,and that's where PES always shined. The pc playerbase of this series is mostly people with low end-medium end machines and KONAMI knows that,so making the game as heavy as the next-gen versions without the time for proper optimization is simply a bad idea. Plus,the PC version is home to some of the best community content ever seen in football games (graphics,official license patches etc.). Let's start with the pros of this year's PES.PROS1)Many modes with enough depth to keep everyone interested until PES 2018 at least.2)Best gameplay ever seen in a football game (best virtual representation of the sport yet)3)Nearly perfect ball physics,making the game very organic and unpredictable instead of scripted and mechanical.4)Excellent collision engine,again making the game organic and natural.5)Improved and balanced goalkeepers that no longer feel a liability and goal scoring feels nice and rewarding once again.6)Great and balanced referee AI (not too lenient and not too strict,truly balanced)7)Improved myClub mode in terms of player acquisition and balanced in terms of RNG (black rarity players are much harder to acquire by top agents)8)Improved Master League mode with even more depth in terms of club micromanagement and budget allocation.9)Excellent team management with tons of tactics to set up both before the match and in real time during the match.10)Best creation suite ever in a football game. You can create anything from scratch or edit anything you like including new stuff in stadium editing such as goalnet colour and mesh.CONS1)Biggest absence of official team and competition licenses yet. (nothing a community patch can't fix)2)Inferior graphics to the PS4/XboxOne versions.3)Online netcode,eventhough it's improved to last year,is still a bit laggy.4)Match commentary sounds forced and heavily scripted. Not natural.CONCLUSIONAt the end of the day the only thing that fancy graphics do is enhance the immersion and PES 2017 doesn't need any immersion enhancement,the quality of the gameplay and opponent AI are more than enough to immerse you in every single match you play,plus if you crave for better graphics and you have a powerful enough pc you can apply texture and sweet FX patches anytime. Nothing comes closer to the real sport as this game. THE KING IS BACK!SCORE9/10			"

												This game is truly amazing! I played both FIFA and PES for a long time, but PES2017 is the best soccer game has ever made! Yea sure there are a couple of missing things, like licenses but it's easily refillable with patches. I played several onine games so far, and only a couple of them was laggy. A lot of people are complaining about the graphics, but it's also improvable with patches. I hope KONAMI continoues this good way, and next years PC port is going to be as good as console port. 8,5/10			"

												FIRST OF: this game is better than ever before! ...and YES, finally the keeper acts like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing keeper! the feeling is awesome, the physics, ball control, movement - just fell in love with it instantly. more is not to say about that. when u have played the previous pes's s s ssssss and u liked it - u will LOVE this one! there r alot more fine tuning options also. now u can even deeper decide how u wanna play.now the meh part. graphics r‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• again. but hey, i was expecting this and im not sad about it. konami just loves the consoles more, for some weird reason...u can use some sweetFX or reshade presets from pes 2016, 15, whatever, so it will look alot better for now. till we get the real stuff, like the league kits and pes 2017 will be close to perfect. another punch in the face; there r as few licenses as never before. eredivisie and ligue 1, are complete. serie a almost, just juventus is missing. clubs like man u, man city, chelsea, real madrid are following by mods... :D playing pes since the very first one and since ive played the first matches, fifa died for me :D the realism part of this series is just outstanding! - but, and this is a huge butt... anyway, fifa 17 is also really good. so close to realism like never before. the gameplay is way faster than previous, frostbite engine looks good, but it's still fifa.... and this is a pes review :D sry..anyways, yeah sure konami is laughin about us pc gamers, but i don't care. i love pro evolution soccer and nowdays, where modders r everywhere, we will get our deserved pes 2017! cheers			"

												PES 2017 is hands down the best football game ever made, and that is why I bought it.If you've been playing football games as long as I have, whether it was FIFA or ISS/WE/PES, you have, no doubt already encountered cases where the sequels of these gigantic franchises disappointed you somehow. Especially lately I find it being a recurring theme in this genre. One year you applaud the current installment for having a great set of animations, a great dribbling feel, a precise passing system that lets you play the ball exactly as you intended, a good balance between the attackers and defenders, shooting system and keepers, and so on. Only to find that the next year brings a completely different story: the keepers suddenly leak like an old bucket, the defenders fail to cover, the through passes become uncatchable, too many goals are scored during the match... You know how it goes. So then you patiently await the trailer for the next installment to see if they're gonna see where the problem was and address it this year, but all you see is fancy names for new technologies that are supposedly improving the game beyond recognition (seriously, how many times were we promised a ""player ID"" system?), but are not  actually changing the gameplay elements that  matter that were kinda ruined the last time.This is why the latest PES is the monument for the genre. What they did was take the decent PES 2016 and tweak it adding improvements where they were much needed and balancing it out to make a better and improved game with the new iteration. Yes, it is silly that this is something monumental that we have to applaud, while it should be common sense, but that's where we are right now.And the result is brilliant. The gameplay allows you to play as you wish, creating chances in all ways known in the football world with no emphasis on any one of them. The defenders are drastically different and immensely more capable of stopping attacks, their well timed and solid tackles are uncomparable to the flimsy and unprecise attempts from midfielders and defenders to take the ball. Goalies are perfect, no more clumsiness and sloppy reactions and gifted goals as a result. The dribbling feel is excellent and direct, the feints are usable if you know how to perform them, and the aerial battles are realistic enough for punting the ball long forward to your tall target men to become a valid tactic. The AI is incredibly smart and will sometimes feel like a live player. You can't just repeat the same moves and passing patterns, because the CPU player will learn to anticipate it and stop it.What's really lacking is the Master League which is promising, but hasn't improved much since last year. Unlike FIFA, players will never stubbornly fight for a bigger paycheck as they become valuable, they won't be picky about the clubs they join, they won't complain if you don't give them enough play time, or just request a transfer because they feel like it. In PES ML they feel like cattle that just does as they're told as you buy them. This makes ML a lot less challenging than it could have been. Not to mention the lack of licenses, a limited but good soundtrack, etc.Right now, PES 2017 is the Richard Burns Rally of the football game world. Weaker presentation, a lack of official licenses and content, not well developed game modes, but in the middle of it lies an absolute gem of a wonderful gameplay that makes everything else irrelevant. And that's beautiful, because that's the essence of a video game, a foundation that must be well built before you can add anything on top of it. The game that focuses on gameplay first and fills the other gaps later is always the best. Like GTA did by making driving and shooting enjoyable before anything else and built around it, while it's competitors consistently failed by trying to fill the game with different content and neglecting it's core.

												I have played them all, from ISS Pro Evolution/Winning Eleven in the 90‚Äôs to the PES 2017 of today. Like any other game there have been good years and bad years, and we all know that Konami has had its challenges. But, to me Pro Evolution has always been the game which simulated real soccer the best. Fifa can have its licenses, better graphics, and whatever else there is, but they cannot (yet) simulate soccer the way Pro Evolution can. This year‚Äôs PES 2017 has surprised me positively. It kind of reminded me of, perhaps the best in its series, the PES 6. The smoothness, the passing, the ball weight, it all just feels right. It‚Äôs not perfect yet, and most probably will never be, but it is most definitely on the right track.  "

												Just wanted to write a review because i really dont think this game gets the credit it deserves....Everyone is crying over graphics and team names but whats being forgotten is how the gameplay smashes Fifa 17! Honestly ive been a Fifa player for years and havent gone near Pro Evo for many years due to Fifa just being so much better but after reading a few reviews i thought id give this years version a go and i have to say im impressed! The things that do let the game down can be sorted (Team names and better graphics ect...) with a simple update off the internet and took all of minutes to install. Fifa does have it better in the licence but when it comes to gameplay Pro Evo is a fair bit better this year, it just feels more fluid and real than the really staged Fifa.. I have nothing against Fifa and will also buy it when i see it on offer but just feel Pro Evo isnt getting the credit it deserves because people are forgetting the main part of the game..... The Football!If your computer is up to it download a high res patch and it makes the game look great and its still smooth and fast.Hope this helps if your stuck between Pro Evo or Fifa :)			"

												My football games playing history (Apart from Sensi/SWOS and Champo/Football Manager):1995-2009: PES (ISS)2009-2015: FIFA2015-: PESI always preferred Konami's game originally because of the superior gameplay.  Licences, graphics, modes etc... are always important but the key part of a game is gameplay.  The simplicity in control and the reliance on the skill of the player in Konami's game always pushed it ahead FIFA for me. However I switched to FIFA due to the stronger online modes in EA's game, and the fact that they were improving year-on-year whereas I felt that Konami were remaining stagnant.This changed last year however, when the PES game finally improved enough for me to switch back with beautiful craftsmanship in the on-pitch action, both in attack and particularly in defence. The passing especially is so much better in PES than FIFA. However I felt last year's online mode was still weak and didn't play it much.  This year, they have improved and the MyClub feature is now shaping up as an alternative to FIFA's Ultimate team. I feel the difference in gameplay is now tangible, particularly the purism of PES compared to FIFA's clunky play. The graphics in both PES and FIFA are weak compared to what they should be on a PC (even with a 4K monitor and GTX 1080) and the console experience is still more fluid than PC for PES. But overall, PES is the definitive football experience currently available on the computer.			"

Brilliant gameplay, better than last year which was already the best PES since PS2.It looks just fine because:I am not looking for water reflections on the leather as I volley the ball in the net,I am not concerned about facial sweat as i bring someone down in a slide tackle,I am not watching the crowd as I bend the ball around the wallI am not looking at the resolution of boot image mapping as I take a penaltyI am not worried about the physics of the goal net as the ball bounces of the upright onto the crossbar and out into the boxWhat the blades of grass are doing as I pull back four goals to win in the final minuteHowever,I am looking at the physics of the ball which is just naturalI am enjoying the game playI am able to use vision, flair and luckI am free to play good football and good looking footballVisuals?Patches have already started coming through to give:Correct teams, players, flags, kits and competitions/cupsHD Stadiums and TurfChants, custom soundtracksBoots and BallsConclusion:If you can‚Äôt see yet what the graphic can‚Äôt show you, you are either:New to PES on PC in which case give it some time and after twenty years of playing you will still find yourself saying ""I have never seen that happen before in PES"", that is PES enduring talentEither that or you are just used to FIFA where everything looks good, has the right names etc.It is lazy, but Konami don‚Äôt need to try too hard.The Modder‚Äôs do the icing, cherries, sprinkles and anything else you want on the cake,Konami just happens to make the football game.The football game, PES			"

												When first run PES 2017 I nearly got a heart attack !! After playing fifa 17 demo and comparing the graphics annimations etc I was so angry at myself for spending money on this year's edition. But when I finally started to play matches everything seemed to be clear. This game Quite Simply, is Fun and gameplay is much better than Fifa very responsive in single and multi very happy with the purchase.PS Just 5 min on goolgle to find and install patch to have all licenses and better graphics than Fifa ;)			"

												Just played a couple of hours. And the game feels great.Graphics ? Well i play with minimum settings as my computer is a bit out dated.But i really don't mind as this is the pleasure while playing i am looking for and guess what... it hasn't feel that good for many years. I really enjoy it. I just don't get it the poor ratings. Slashing PES 2017 for the poor graphics while the gameplay is fantastic is just dumb and unfair. Would any one rate CS poorly because of the outdated graphics? It just doesn't make sense. I agree, transfer are not up to date, real names missing etc. But this is a well known thing with PES. You need to find and install one of the many patches available from the active PES community. If you are a PES fan or looking for real digital football on PC, do not hesitate. This year's PES is very good.			"

												This game takes time to learn, it is an in-depth futebol simulation, no other futebol game comes close to the gameplay.If you love futebol and have the patience to learn the game, this game is very rewarding, the greatest futebol game ever created in my opinion.Goalkeepers and Referees have been dramatically overhauled, it's amazing to see how much it adds to the gameplay.  The gameplay overall is very different from Pes 2016, it is more refined and subtle.  The freedom to do more things is apparent and it promotes varied play as there arn't any sure ways to score, it is very 'in the moment'.  Im scoring all-types of goals that was not possible/very rare in Pes 2016.   Graphics, are pretty good actually.  Especially with some sweetfx, even default look is improved from last year.  Im more of gameplay orientated gamer, so graphics while important, are not as important to me as gameplay.I have already put Ronaldinho face in the game so I can use him as one of the pillars in my ML team, and away I go. : )			"

All they do is push the ball away to another opposition player to score.3) Ofcourse the licenses are a problem ( Yes you can use mods, but i don't pay so much to edit the entire freaking game files myself )4) Graphics are a let down but for first timers its decent.-If u have high hopes and want an absolute Master Class this game will surely let you down!-Buy it only if you want to just play it casually for fun and ofcourse ONLY WHEN YOU GET IT ON SALE !

The gameplay and graphics are much better than FIFA's and there are plenty of patches to download if you don't like something!It's a must buy for real football lovers!			"

												So far so good. Quick Disclaimer:Now I am a Football fan and have pretty much played Fifa/PES my whole life. Each year I would buy both games however the last few years Fifa just doesn't have it for me so I soley bought PES and waited for Fifa to become free on Origin access so I can see what it is like - Anyway...PES 2017 is actually pretty good. Obviously we are shafted with a 50/50 port slash Next gen version on the PC however we pay literally half the price on PC than we would on the PS4/Xbone. Not that this is an excuse for us to get shafted every year but it softens the blow. The gameplay of this years version is very fluid, build-up play is great and the whole game itself feels more polished. Remember folks we buy football games for the gameplay not to see Christiano Ronaldo look shiner than ever... Well I do anyway lol. The sole reason I purchase PES on the PC is the modding scene... People crying already about unlisenced teams when all they need to do is either edit the teams themselves or wait for a Patch of which will make the game more liscened than Fifa. Also those crying about the graphics... There are also some Graphic mods that I am sure will be released in due time. Just wait - although I don't even think they are that bad (albeit pretty much the same as the base game from last year). If you want a great football sim experience then I would recommend this game.If you have paitence to wait for patches to make this game 100% more authentic then I would recommend this game. If you love football then I would recommend this game. If you want to act like a 12 year old crying about graphics then go and buy Fifa.			"

												In my opinion, it is the best football game to date. It feels realistic. Gameplay has improved a lot and it is realistic, though there may be minor bugs, which I hope they improve. Goalies have also improved a lot. Now, the behave as such. Defences are tough and they are not easy to beat, which is great. Now, the ""superstar"" level is worth its name. The game is really funny and challenging. Besides, the way you command players and their movementes, either attacking or defending, has also improved big time. It also feels realistic.Graphics, as we all know, are poor yet they can be improved by using mods. As regards animations, they are, mainly, the same we had last year. There was not an improvement in this respect, at least in the PC version.Again, licenses are poor yet we can fix that issue, too.If KONAMI are going to fight against piracy, which is correct, they MUST treat PC users as we deserve as we have paid for the game.For that reason, I hope to get updates and bugs corrections as well as new faces and DCLs weekly. To sum up, if I focus just on the gameplay, I have to say that it is the best football game I've ever played.Cheers.			"

												in general it is fine, I have played about ten hours and can say that it has preatty good physics and as for me it is really hard to play so far. I've just won only several matches. And I like this. Many realistic episodes when player just misses the ball as my favourit team makes everytime :)Drawbacks:- not ready for keybord(really? in 2016? publishing game in steam?). So in the end I just bought xbox controller. But mouse is still disabled in menus. why? is this feature so hard to implement??- graphics is not so necessary for me, but it looks ok for me. But maybe it could be better.- I found how to exit only after several hours!!! UI-monsters!!! UI in general not so good.- lack of teamsEverythig else is fine so far.			"

												I was also disapponted at first, cause I couldn't use the wings properly, couldn't score, couldn't win... Then I started to learn the game. It wasn't a game anymore. It's almost reality. The gameplay is so realistic I don't even want to play online. The Aƒ± really somehow understands you. Don't be sad that theres no Manchester or Real Madrid (you will be able to edit later.) The important part is that players are so realistic they play like they play in real life. Also no more Robben - Ronaldo CF duo is a winner. You have a real keeper to stop them. NOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE REAL GAMEPLAY SKILL AND FOOTBALL KNOWLEDGE TO WIN IN THIS GAME...Buy if you want to play a real football game. 10/10			"

												As you could have already predicted, graphics-wise, it's on the same level as PES 2016 PC version, in a matter of fact, it looks nearly identical - subpar compared to the 8th generation consoles. The most unfortunate part about this is that the spectators look like pixelated demon spawn clones from hell. What seems to be improved though is the player models and faces, which I think are on the same level as the console versions. What PS4 and XB1 copies have to offer are better lighting, shadows, post-processing effects such as model tracking motion blur, HDR etc. - pretty much everything graphics related. This PC version seems to have none of them. Thanks Konami. What an absolutely chivalrous way to please your paying PC customers.Now to the part why I still decided to recommend this game; you probably guessed it: GAMEPLAY. On all areas the gameplay is so much more fluid, responsive and overall better compared to PES 2016. Animations, especially goalkeeper animations are greatly improved. And the best part is passing play: short passes, long passes, low lobs, chips, everything works so well and natural. Collision detection is improved, and now the referee actually reacts to fouls like he should. Really great stuff, it does feel like a proper simulation of football. I kinda feel obliged to not recommend the game, but this is all we have for the newest, most accurate football simulator of now for the PC (not talking about you, FIFA 17). One big minus is the lacking team licenses, but I'm keen on waiting for modifications, which I'm quite sure will be on the making as soon as possible. All in all: If you are a big PES gameplay fan, and don't mind to spend the full price, buy it. If you aren't much a fan of PES, own either XB1 or PS4, prefer FIFA, are tired of Konami taking a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on PC only players in the graphics department: don't buy it. Or at least be patient and wait for the discounts to come.			"

												First of  all i didn't owned a PS4/Xbox One so i wouldn't mind the difference in the graphics etc. The gameplay is beyond amazing, maybe the best i've ever played. I play the games with 34' wide monitor (it would be nice for Konami to add 21:9 3440x1440 support though) and for me the graphics is smooth and okay, i mean i won't expect PES graphics to be on par like when i played Witcher 3 or other demanding games, but it's okay for a football simulation games. For the lack of licenses, fake names,kits etc once patches start rolling out, the advantage FIFA17 held over licenses would be irrelevant. But in the end, i really hope that Konami really put the effort to make the PC version on par or even  better than console version (PC is whole lot better in specs anyway).			"

Although konami did state months ago that it wouldn't be same quality yet people seem to not realise this. Also mods on PES PATCH can rectify it to a degree so again for me not a deal breaker.Sidenote, for me licences are not a con as it is very easy to go onto PESPATCH.COM and download the strips there in one file.

												*Edited after a few more hours of play*So far I'm enjoying the game very much. The AI, player animations, myClub, and Master League are all refined and improved from the 2016 edition. Once mods start appearing online, FIFA's licensing advantage will become irrelevant. Yes, it uses the same engine as PES 2016, so the graphics are about the same as last year (though as I said, there seem to be more and varied animations for various actions). However, this also means that if you could run last year's version on your PC, you should be able to run this year's without a hitch. This is important to me as my PC is not cutting edge. I get much better performance on high settings with PES2017 than in the FIFA 2017 demo on low settings.If you liked PES 2016, and if you go into this expecting a refinement (rather than a reinvention) of what you liked in the last edition, then you should enjoy PES 2017.

												If you're after purely gameplay this is definitely a great soccer simulation however the biggest gripe people have is visually it is lacking compared to it's console (PS4 / Xbox One) counterparts.It lacks the little visual improvements seen in the console versions which truly make it a great game and round of the complete experience.So if you have either a PS4 or Xbox One get that version instead however if PC is your only option you can't really fault the game as it still plays well. In addition here is a youtube video showing the visual difference between the games.

 Here's hoping Konami are listening to all the feedback from PC gamers and hopefully release PES 2018 to be on par with the console version or else they'll see alot of their market jump over to the FIFA bangwagon as EA have done a fantastic job in releasing a consistent version across all platforms.

												Game is not bad at all, they changed different things that makes the game better, goal keepers have improved and now catch the ball much more often than last year, they are smarter, AI in general have changed, players move around much more but sometimes it makes it a little harder to pass, passes this year are more difficult, it takes time to get used to it, shots have become more difficult too, you now miss more than last year, bounces sometimes feel artificial, however they are not as frustrating as FIFA, bounces go to the direction they should but they are easier to catch by players and they end directly on players more often than not, far less realistic than other years in this, also what I noticed is opponents can get you the ball tackling from behind as soon as you receive the ball from a pass, it's not realistic at all.Agility of players improved a bit even if controls still feel more robotic than FIFA on PC,  input lag still there and often it makes it impossible to play properly, sprinting is not consistent, sometimes player run at their speed, sometimes they take a lot to sprint, as a result opponents can take you the ball before you can even move,  also even if they improved referees there is still the annoying glitch that let opponents kick your legs and take you the ball like that without foul.Graphics are still the same but for better lighting slightly improved presentationOverall gameplay has improved but game is much more dependant on player stats this year, all game modes have improved to some extent, the introduction of more options for scouting in Myclub improved the game mode, Master League and Be a Legend have improved as well, more options, more indepth.I don't recommend this game simply cause it's notl better than FIFA17 online whose gameplay feels scripted and unbalanced.However try the demo first  and judge yourself whether to buy it or not and if you are unsure, buy it on sale, keep in mind the game online feels a way too pay to win with stats being far more important than personal skills, don't buy unless you only play offline			"

												I'll start with I'm not the best player. This game is broken huge big time. When you go to play online they put you up against players who skill rating is twice if not three times greater than your oen. I'm 336 online, 99% of the time I'm put up against 500+ players, who have teams full of Bale, Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar to name a few. This is turn makes it very hard and unpleasant to play. You also can not earn enough Xp/GP to constantly keep your team contracts all going and fitness levels, which results in you buying GP to actually play the game. If you're reading this andecided whether to buy this, AVOID it, I'm going to pick Fifa up instead, at least you can keep your team afloat without having to spend actual money.			"

												I've been playing PES for years, since around 2003/2004. I gotta say, the graphics on PC being a PS3 Port makes the game go backwards in production and gameplay. It's sad that PES 2015,16,17 all I have owned on PC just remind me of PES 2008. God damn it! That's 8 years ago KONAMI!I posted a Review last year saying I hated the graphics and said it was OKAY because you pay half price, right now.. That's about the only good thing about the game and even then ¬£25 is a huge amount for what seems like an ""Old Game""I wish I had good things to say about PES, like I did back on my PlayStation 3 days but unfortunately the only good thing that has came from this is that I got Pique and Bale in my first 2 ball openings...I'll get the game, like other reviewers as it's the only ""Football"" game on steam, disregarding Football Manager. Hopefully next year will be better, or will I be saying the same stuff? Well we'll see next year.			"

												Summary: In PES 2017, the 1st touch is calculated by player attributes, as well as the further inclusion of real ball physics directly controlled by the input ball touch. See how different players control the ball in unique and different ways based on where and how you control them, dictating the flow of the game based on how they react to the unpredictable movement of the ball. In addition, there is more control in how you receive passes, and depending on the pass, players can visually execute the exact play intended, from receiving a pass to sending the ball out again.Metascore: 69/100 (9 Critics)In my opinion: Much teams without license, limited resolution. But it's PES.User-Score: 5/10			"

												This game blows. All advantage is always slanted to the computer. Passes frequently fly past open attackers. Goal kicks frequently go nowhere near the player you point them at, but directly to wide open opponents. Cpu players run at full speed all game and don't tire, but user energy meters die quickly with even moderate use of the sprint function. Defenders don't respond to most user input, especially inside the box. If the A.I. team has a corner kick, you might as well get ready for the kickoff. They have improved nothing at all. Absolutely nothing. This is the madden of soccer games (that's no compliment). Goodbye, Konami. I'll be sure to spread the word.			"

												This is by no means a slag on PES ""17"" Review.I want to put across more reasons behind, or CONS as to why I refunded after 10 mins-Initial launch the game went to a white screen, but you could hear sound-To adjust screen Resoultion you need to verify game cache-Game stopped running in white screen once i moved to windowed mode....seriously?-Game is a Console Port from xbox, and terribly done-Used a PS4 controller, didnt match up with game. More designed for xbox or steam controller-At one stage I even played with a keyboard, probably wouldve had better luck with a joystick-PES stated that they had gotten the rights to major club logos and brands, you would think that would atleast be the EPL? Wrong its infact certain clubs from across the globe only, thats why you see advertised clubs like Liverpool, Barcelona and Dortmund in screenshots. Otherwise get used to playing as Mun Red Town( Manchester United) or whatever theyve been called.Otherwise its a great game, I am planning on purchasing again, but on console. This vs FIFA, is like going back to the grass roots of Football...arcade style like FIFA 2000 was. FIFA is great aswell IMO, it requires more technical skills eg timing/dribbling. But the new Penalty taking system is Cancer itself!!			"

Graphics only 1% better then PES15, still only 16 stadiums, irritating gameplay changes make thru balls useless, AI stack defense so no way thru and goalies are amazingly good ==>  very few goals.  Also AI defenders are qiuicker than all my attackers so rarely get a claer shot at goal.    Rage quit !!!

												As a player of both Fifa and Pes along the years, constantly changing as my main ""football game of the year"" from one to another, - You know what i mean: ""Ah ... this years Fifa is better , gonna switch from Pes"", i got to say that about this years PES 2017.1. Is the best football game, to play with your friends, ever. Just that. Every game , win or lose, is more fun and less rage than any other football game. 2. After many years of fifa. (11-13-15-16) i got to say that Pes 17 is the worst online expierience i 've ever had on a football game. The overall online gameplay system is not perfect at all but the worst part is ofc the lagg. This makes it unplayable. Most of the times i have <70ms ping  while i tried like many hours and many times to find a descent , no lagging game. That never happened. I don't want to switch back to fifa just for the online game now as i like to commit to 1 football game/year but now PES2017 is mostly the game i play when a friend comes for some local coop fun.

												The game of passing they said it would be lmao - If you like to have a lot of lost games due to ""lost connections"" you really have to buy this wonderful KONAMI product, they did a GREAT job as always...best part is you also lose your ingame money so  konami is in no hurry to do something about it. youtubers/ streamers quit playing this game - they stream FIFA now - quess why ?? the walhalla of broken connections this game sucks so much more than anything else you can imagine. hard to find oppenents it takes sometimes 15 minutes  to find one, you can play better 100% of the time but if you dont score fast enough the engine makes you lose. tactics are useless. the play / players suddenly slow down, ridiculous rebounds make you lose, dont believe you ever get a black ball because you wont, ever,OH if you get a red card just make three own goals and red card dont counts anymore next match   dont buy this game ppl			"

												Best football game I ever played. Thanks Konami for the excellent work. :DThe only thing I do not like in this game is the graphics that are terrible but the gameplay is excellent.			"

												Em portugu√™s(brasileiro) / In brazilian portuguese:Jogo divertido mas que poderia ser melhor.Em primeiro lugar, os gr√°ficos s√£o da velha gera√ß√£o e o gramado √© um tapete liso de textura borrada, pra mim que joga no Medium numa GPU Radeon HD 7650m rodando a 60 fps(voc√™ precisa rodar a 60 fps sen√£o o jogo fica travando). J√° chegou a hora da konami equivaler os gr√°ficos e o jogo a nova gera√ß√£o sem distin√ß√£o. E pretendo pegar um novo PC para rodar.Jogo na dificuldade normal e que com o passar do tempo ficou muito f√°cil e jogar no pr√≥ximo n√≠vel, o Profissional j√° √© bem mais desafiante e por vezes frustrante, especialmente no modo Rumo ao estrelato. Deveria haver um modo de dificuldade meio-termo entre os dois.Um dos modos mais divertidos e que n√£o existe no Fifa √© o Rumo ao estrelato onde voc√™ vive a vida futebol√≠stica desde o in√≠cio de um jogador de futebol e controla somente ele em campo com vis√£o de terceira pessoa vertical, como se estivesse dentro do campo. Uma pena que faltam tantas licen√ßas e instalar patchs dizem que dificulta os jogos online.Jogar de dois ou mais jogadores locais com amigos √© uma das op√ß√µes mais divertidas, com diversas op√ß√µes de copas e ligas diferentes, jogando cada um em seu time ou todos os jogadores no mesmo time.Pra jogar voc√™ precisa ter internet, n√£o adianta colocar o steam no modo offline, uma baita sacanagem.Se voc√™ quer saber se prefere Pes ou Fifa baixe a demo dos dois. Aquele modo est√≥ria do Fifa √© muito sem no√ß√£o mesmo. E j√° est√° na hora do Fifa adicionar um modo similar ao Rumo ao estrelato.De qualquer forma, foram in√∫meras horas de pura divers√£o pra mim que n√£o jogava PES j√° a alguns anos e que sempre o preferiu em rela√ß√£o a Fifa. Mas se a Konami n√£o fizer o pr√≥ximo jogo com gr√°ficos de pr√≥xima gera√ß√£o e mudan√ßas significativas, mesmo porque esse jogo anual √© bem caro, n√£o pretendo comprar a pr√≥xima vers√£o e olharei com carinho o pr√≥ximo Fifa.In english:Funny game that could be better.First, the graphics are old generation and the pitch/grass is a blurred  pack of textures, like a green smooth carpet. I play on medium at 60 fps in a GPU Radeon HD 7650m(you need to run at 60 fps else the game gets sluggish). It's time for konami to equalize the graphics and the game with the new-gen without distinction. Also I pretend to get a new PC to run it.I play on normal difficulty wich has become very easy and playing at the next level, Professional, is quite harder and sometimes frustrating especially in Become a Legend mode(BAL). There should be a medium-term difficulty between the two.One of the funniest modes that doesn't exist in Fifa is Become a Legend where you live the life of a single soccer player since the beginning and controls only him on the field with vertical third-person view. It's a pity it misses so many licenses and they say installing patchs makes playing online harder.Playing with two or more players locally with friends is one of the funniest options, with several options of Cups and Leagues, playing each one in it's own team or all the players in the same team.To play you need internet, it doesn't work putting steam on offline mode, a big let down.If you want to know whether you prefer Pes or Fifa download both demos. That story mode on Fifa is really nonsense. And it's about time Fifa adds a similar mode to BAL.Anyway, I had several hours of pure joy for me that haven't played PES for a few years and that always prefered it over Fifa. But if Konami doesn't make the next game new-gen and with substantial changes, even bacause this is expensive and anually, I probably won't be buying it and will look closely to Fifa.			"

												Good graphics +Good Gameplay +Too Many crash -Too much icompatibility -Hard to recognizing graphics cards -Weak and limited database -Restricted content without licenses -Online many of the multiplayer competitions like cups and divisions are never available or there is almost never any opponent to challenge - - - -We can thank external publishers and mods who are keen to share with the community more complete packages so we can enjoy the game, which should be done by Konami before the game is released - - - - -Rating from 0/100 = 60/100			"

												This is tough, I really want to support this game as the base gameplay is pretty good. However, the promised features when the game launched (exclusive stadiums and extras) are not available to PC players. We knew the graphics are subpar compared with XB1 and PS4 but to not get the additional content when this wasn't made clear at the start really kicks the PC player while they're down. Hopefully Konami listen to their PC fans for I fear many will abandon the game next year after so long being ignored.My advice, wait until next year (to see if they raise the game to current-gen standard).

												For sake of old times, I buy and play this game with friends, really different from console version, and the Server is bad, playing online is not good enough.The gameplay after playing a couple of hours is interesting. I enjoy this game with my friends.			"

												DissapointingI see konami keeps adding and removing features. I played every PES since 2006 (skipped 2016) and I often see konami doing some neat development in making it a realistic football simulator. Such as player interaction, sponsors, dynamic staff, dynamic player groth, fans etc in the football life play modes. And much more I can't say from the top of my head now.Maybe it was already in 2016 but I notice all those things are stripped off the game and it just dumbed down to a mediocre football arcade game. This game looks made solely for online since the singleplayer modes are so stale and uninteractive. The CPU is always a 2-3 touch passer that can't dribble. The CPU always tries crappy long shots that miss when a ball rolls off the box. The CPU never slide tackles, the amount of cards are also always low. The CPU always tries to shoot the free kick when its remotely close to the box, never pass. Just play 'become a legend' like I did for a few seasons. Every single match feels 99% the same and end in 1-0/2-0/1-1 Konami shows in the trailers how realistic the playmode is but I feel 0,0 of this during the actual game, if you made the graphics equal I wouldn't see the difference between pes 2010 and pes 2017.ML is alrightish but misses a lot of the interaction and dynamic I liked so much.And the rating system, has been‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•since it ever existed. Sent off? 4.5/5.0. didn't do much? 5.5. Did some passing work? 6.0. Had maybe a keypass or an assist? 6.5. Scored a goal? 7.0 Scored one goal or more? 7.5. Don't ever expect getting more than 7.5.Surprises me how PES and FIFA keep getting positive reviews every year, yet if you look into them I see a lot of lackluster content and little updates. I guess the bar isn't raised high for football games.			"
