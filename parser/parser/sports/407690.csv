												Bottom of the 4th, Pujols at the plate. Here comes the 2-1 pitch... and he hits a screamer into the alley in left center!!!! This will go for extra bases! Wait... Albert? Albert?? He's just standing at home plate! ALLLLBERRRTTT!!!!!! And Pujols is thrown out at first.""Yes, this game has bugs. But wait - I'm an uncoordinated old fart - maybe I hit the wrong button on my steam controller. Nope. The little mini-map that shows the base runners showed no base runners. It wasn't my noobness. Considering other bugs, I know it wasn't me.After the very first game, my starting pitcher won the game! Woot. Then he won it again! Wait huh? After the one and only game, my first starting pitcher had a record of 2-0. That's Cy young material there!This is one of those games you wish you had a ""Meh"" button mashed between the ""Yes I recommend it"" and ""No I dont"" buttons. It's a fun little arcady type game. If you are looking for a serious and detailed baseball simulation, look elsewhere. If you want to blow 10 minutes every now and then in a brain dead way, then yeah.... I recommend it despite its faults. The graphics aren't quite Major League quality (more like double A) but its merely adequate. The sound? Well... my recomendation is to play this while watching a real baseball game and crank up the TV's volume.In the end, Im giving it a thumbs up because I will probably keep playing it for whatever brain dead reason of mine.

												This Game isn't what I was looking for but its a step up from last year. I was a bit let down by the fact that the game developers didn't make a carrer mode or a Francise mode this year. And the fact that they don't allow trades during the season and there's no custom create a player mode or sliders. I just didn' like it!!!			"

												As a fan (and owner) of the original RBI Baseball from the Nintendo days, I am very pleased with this game. Has all the nostalgic nods to the old days and brings it to today. It feels and plays just like I remember it. Was able to just jump right in and get at it. Of course, there are quite a few improvements over the NES version of yester years with authentic MLB rosters and stats along with pretty good renders of the actual stadiums (that I have seen so far). Takes a bit of time to get use to the speed of the pitching and controlling your fielders, but I know this will be one I will enjoy as the season goes on.Those of you looking for an experience like MLB The Show, keep moving. This is by no means a complete MLB simulation game. Graphics are smooth and purdy, but I care more for gameplay than I do how good it looks.This was my first time playing any of the new RBI Baseball games that started in 2014, and I am happy with my purchase. Cant wait to get more in tune with the controlls and timing so that I may get my taste of online ranked matches.In short, if you loved the original RBI Baseball on the NES, this will not dissapoint. PLAY BALL!!!! GO ASTROS!!!!			"

												Its ok and a pretty fun basic title, but I'm really disappointed at one MAJOR issue.If you are pitching, moving your pitcher to the far right or left of the mound (depending on the hitters hand) and just throwing a ball with ""A"" (i.e. dont move stick) results in a strike like 99% of the time. Pitch, swing, miss. Over and over.Someimes the AI will make contact, but as I say, its very rare. Thats what I found anyways and its spoiling the game, so going to have to give it a thumbs down until this is corrected.Not tried online yet, which should be better in this regard, but dont really like playing baseball online as not found many people that try to play it properly and dont just swing at everything.

												I love the RBI Baseball games on Steam and 16 is no exception. It has working multiplayer which is rare in the baseball genre on the PC. It's best to have friends on your list to play the game against. Finding random players is rare because the playerbase is so small.Aside from that, there have been overall improvements to the game. Graphics look much better than in 15 and the pitching is fixed. Batting system has been improved. New fielding moves (automatic). The AI has been revamped and has downloadable roster updates as the season progresses. This game is arcadey, fast paced and simplistic. Don't let the word simplistic fool you though, it's still a lot of fun.My only gripes are the Max FPS not having a disable option (as it is now you can only choose 30fps or 60fps) and when enabling v-sync the game suffers from a bit of studder\lag. We need an option to disable Max FPS. Also, V-Sync seems like it needs more work and be polished up some.			"

												Retro gaming with better graphics...thats what it is. Some reviews are negative because its not ""sim"" enough. Well, its not a ""sim"". If you want some fun, laid back baseball, then here it is. I would love a good pc sim like The Show, but this isnt supposed to be The Show. Based on that, its pretty good. Just think classic baseball game with updated visuals and you wont be let down.			"

												If you played previous years of R.B.I Baseball this game will feel very familiar to you. It plays very much the same if not exactly the same. Automatic dives and jumps have been added this year, which is a good thing. I was really hoping for the ability to make trades during season mode. Currently that isn't an option. I was also hoping for injuries or fatigue for the fielders. Sadly both are lacking again this year. All the fields are there as well as the players. I enjoyed last year's game and I enjoy this one. Can I recommend it? Yes, if you're looking for a baseball game on the PC platform. No, if you're looking for an all out in-depth baseball sim. This is NOT The Show by any stretch. It is, like previous years, an arcade style baseball game.			"

												Even after reading some of the negative reviews and buying this game anyway and playing it at first, the games controls are really complicated, you are unable to change them and if you were to catch a fly ball you can't tell where its going to land until it already hit the ground. The main reason why I gave this game a positive review is I solved all the problems later while playing this game. A good thing is that this game that I haven't mentioned is that hasn't crashed once which is the reason why I refunded RBI baseball 15. With the controls I started using my steam controller and the controls are MUCH EASIER to use when playing this game. With fly balls or fielding I went to the settings and clicked ""assisted"" on fielding and now I can actually get outs on Flyballs and popups and this game is now actually real fun. If you get this game I would stay under the 2 hour limit and refund it if you have other problems with it that I didn't have or used to have. Finally, if you have a Steam controller or a Xbox controller and you have this game I recommend you use it since the controls are much easier.			"

												While not a fancy ""Baseball Simulator"" that most sports games seem to be like these days.   This game with reasonably good modern graphics reminds me of simpler sports games on the NES.   Not complicated, easy to play, good for playing for the fun of it.    If you want a serious sports simulation, play something else.   If you just want to have some fun hitting some pixelated baseballs for a while, then this game is worth the price.			"

												This game keeps it simple and doesn't waste your time. When a batter strikes out, it gets right to the next one without making you watch him walk up to the plate. When a play is finished, there are no slow motion replays or commentary to slow down the action. You can wrap up a nine-inning game in no time and move right on to the next one, which makes playing an entire season seem like an actual possibility.It sticks to the basics. There's a roaring crowd, cheerful organ music, and umpires to tell you who's safe and who's out. Despite its simplicity, it also features all the real-life teams, players, and stadiums, keeping you updated with all the latest roster updates.The controls are nice and simple. They remind me of the old days of playing on the SNES as a kid. The pitching and batting are two-dimensional, so the ball never goes above or below the strike zone. The options let you manually control the fielders or give you AI assistance. You can also specify your favorite team, so you can spend less time in the menus and more time playing ball.It's a simple baseball game the way it should be. Just like Mom used to make (if your mom used to make video games).			"

												I just got this game on sale for like $7.00 on steam sale and I want to thank all the dumb asses who gave it a negative review so that it was on sale for such a low price. This game is meant to be played with a controller and it feels really good as far as the controls. I was playing the original RBI baseball on my emulator last night having fun and while online afterwards I noticed that this game was out and I didn't even know it and let me say it feels great and looks great and all these scrubs giving it negative reviews obviously don't have a decent xbox controller and/or they have no idea how to play this game even though it is pretty self explanitory. I would have paid full price and thank you to the developer for continuing to make this franchise. Best baseball game by far!			"

												Enjoyable simple little arcade baseball. Plays like an old console game but with pleasant yet rudimentary visuals. Easy to pick a team and get right into it but don't expect much depth.I'm fairly new to baseball having moved to America recently and am playing the game as a means of learning the finer points of the game. Roster will update online so if accurate rosters are important to you, that'll keep you happy.I wanted a straightforward baseball game that was easy to wrap my head around and that's exactly what this is.

												This game isn't really bad, it just a disappointment at times. The season mode should take you right into the postseason if you have a good enough record, the postseason mode should have the ability to customize the playoff brackets, there's no customizable controls, and has some bad bugs. For instance, if you ever check your swing and end up hitting the ball, it doesn't matter if it's an easy ground ball out or a bloop single intto shallow center, the runner will stay at the plate. It's programmed very lazily, however the game is still very fun and replayable. I definitely recommend it to any baseball fan looking for a pick-up and play experince, but absolutely not a the asking price of $20. It is honestly insulting that this game ever costed (and still costs) $20, considering that it's not finished. However, if you happen to find this game on sale for under $10, I would say pick it up for yourself, but be mildly cautious about the whole experience in general.			"

												Growing up, I loved Ken Griffey Jr's Winning Run on SNES. I bought this expecting something similar. Not The Show or the 2K series, not OOTP, but an arcadey version of baseball to scratch the itch without putting in too much effort. I didn't want perfection, the occasional bug would've been fine.For the most part I got what I was expecting, but I quickly found a game ruining bug where both myself and the AI could hit NOTHING but foul balls. Hitting a ball in play was no longer possible. We would both smack foul ball after foul ball until a walk or a missed swing for a strikeout (which was rare). Every at-bat turned into a 20+ pitch at-bat. It didn't matter that my pitcher was exhausted (200+ pitches), the AI was just going to hit fouls no matter what. I restarted the game, it went okay for several innings until the bug reappeared. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the refund policy was for less than 2 hours played. I own over 70 games on Steam, never regretted a purchase, never asked for a refund. This game broke that streak for me.I am very disappointed that the MLB would endorse and advertise for this game. I don't think any of them actually played it for more than an hour. No arcade baseball game for PC is better than having this game.			"

												Easily the worst baseball game I've ever played. I don't know who would want to play 162 games in Season Mode when I can't stomach the frustration to make it through one exhibition match without rage-quitting. The control scheme makes you feel like you're watching a Little League game considering how painful and difficult even the most routine plays can be. I constantly find my baserunners running themselves into double plays, my fielders dropping simple pop-ups, and my fielders sometimes not even pursuing the ball at all.There's no trading or player creation either. Rosters were last updated at the non-waiver trade deadline, so at least they're current. And can we talk about how this game looks like it belongs on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dreamcast? Because the graphics are abysmal for a title that even goes so far as to put the current year in its name...Awful, awful game. Do not buy. Pirate if you must, but don't give your money to the baboons who made this steaming garbage pile of a ""baseball game"".			"

I see some people defend this as a arcarde-style game, but there is a major difference between good arcade Baseball games (like Super Mega Baseball) and this. The  wodden animations, the poor visial quality (excecpt the menus, those look really awesome), the controls... every aspect is disappointing and seems poorly thoutout and implemented. Do yourself a favor: If you want realistic action oriented Baseball get a Ps4 and The Show, if you want to manage a Baseball team get OOTP, if you want an arcade style Baseball game: get Super Mega Baseball or play Genesis Baseball on an emulator.

												On paper this sounds awesome. Retro gaming with modern graphics, current rosters, and beautiful models of actual stadiums to play in.In execution it falls very flat. You can't dive, jump, or turn double plays even with the ball hit directly to your middle infielders. Good luck going around the horn...It's also frustrating to field fly balls. The interface for showing how far away the ball is tends to be misleading, and lining your fielder up with the ring rarely results in a catch. You need to be a little before or after the ring and they'll make an awkward stab at it to rein it in.Batting is ridiculous, as the CPU manages to make pitches fade right under your bat, while you can't replicate the same effect. It's either a 94 MPH fastball, or a 72 MPH ""wobbler"" that the CPU never offers at.I can't recommend this even at $6.50.			"

												So right off the bat there are two major problems with the game.Problem 1 - No Player Career option, which is what I wanted; its purely team control.Problem 2 - Pitching from the batters perspective.  That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t didn't work in the 2008 cricket games, although there the problem was batting from the bowlers perspective.Same basic problem though;  WTH were they thinking? Just because that's what the TV camera sees doesn't mean its a good angle for gameplay.Plus you seem to have no real control over what pitches to throw or how to throw them, although that might be easier to magane if you weren't pitching from a mirror.Verdict. This game sucks!Better off playing MLB 2k11 - despite all its bugs.			"

												Disappointing.Don't bother with this pile of drivel. It's 2016. Shame on the developers (who shall not be named) on their quest  to make a quick buck.It's like playing  30 year old 8-bit Nindento (which was fun back in 1986) .Can't belive i paid $$ for this.Looks like im  gonna to have to go back to my old EA 2000 baseball to get my baseball fix. Hopefuly one of these days we'll get back to when developers are not afraied to  make a good ball gme............... "

												Not what I was looking for. Knew it was arcade style going in, but expected more control.  No ability to control pitch or select pitch type . No ability to set the batter to pull right or left.  No ability to set fielders.  Looks like it's back to MVP 2005 and a roster mod.			"

												This is garbage. If you're looking for even a decent sports game, this is not it. The graphics are terrible and there is no skill involved in the game. It's the same controls as a baseball game from the NES days. Those games were fun, but for a Licensed game in this day and age, it's the worst. And I know it's only 30 dollars canadian, but I couldn't even finish a game before I had to quit. I want to play baseball on the PC, and I thought if I bought this game the MLB might see intrest for PC sports games. But this is an NES port with nicer graphics and not worth the money.			"

												Played okay for a while (albeit with a few bugs, including some that defy actual baseball rules) and now crashes on launch every time. Support is literally nonexistent since the release of the 2017 edition. Avoid.			"

												It's the best baseball game i've got on PC. It's a bit basic, but it's cool, and works perfectly, and supports perfectly 4K resolution, and it's not too expensive. I like this game.			"

												As a person who has played RBI baseball since 1990, this game tries but comes up WAY short. If it's going to be ""RBI Baseball"" and appealing to nostalgia, why don't they just make it look like RBI baseball, like the original game did? Namco did exactly that about 10 years ago in their Japanese game and it was awesome. Instead, we have a typical modern baseball video game that puts graphics above gameplay.If you're feeling nostalgic, just dust off your old NES/Famicom, because this will not do the trick at all.

A great baseball game, but it has some issues and bugs. For example, the sound effects often turn off, even when I make sure the volume is normal. And don't even bother with online play unless you invite a friend, the computer will freeze. (Here's a command to close frozen apps: MAC-command, alt, esc/ PC-control, alt, delete.) But despite that, I found this to be a great game. You can choose your team's unfiforms, where they play, and change your roster. (You can't add players from different teams to your roster, and I really wished they had that function!) I recommend changing the controls to MODERN in the settings, and make sure the resolution is the same that your computer has for easier play. OK, so this was more of a bunch of how-to tips instead of a review... As for getting the game, I'd stick with MLB The Show if you have a Playstation. But if you don't have a Playstation and really like baseball, this game is perfect for you!			"

												If you want people to keep playing the game and ""upping"" their level in terms of starting from ""easy"" then moving onto a more difficult level, then you may consider making the ""medium"" level actually playable.  ""Medium"" plays more like a super difficult level simply because hitting the ball is like actually trying to hit a major league pitch coming at you at 100 mph.The ""easy"" level is way too easy, especially when you can consistently score 15 plus runs every game with 25 hits and up.Just an fyi			"

												Batting camera angle makes it very hard to time your hit right, especially since the game is made for controller but none of my controllers work properly with it. Left direction is constantly held down, and buttons are all mixed up (X pitched when assigned to A)			"

												Honestly a decent baseball game. Simple but effective control layout. Nothing spectacular but great in it's simplicity. In sports, you cannot control all variables. This game is no different. Even if you get good at, lets say hitting, it's still an entertaining challenge to make contact no matter how much you may be able to run up the score. Each at bat is challenging as when I played real baseball.			"

												Terrible game.  RBI 16 occupies a space between arcade gaming and stats-heavy simulation.  Which is to say that it lacks the charm or fun of either genre.  Just a middling effort all around.  Menus look great though.  WTG, MLB. "

												Like the old joke goes......Steam reviewer says ""Why do you play that simple, bugging RBI baseball; don’t you know the game isn't that good?"" ‘Of course it’s kinda crap, but, damn it, it’s the only game in town!’”RBI Baseball is kinda the only ""current"" game in town. Yes, it is very simple, yes, it has a few bugs, yes, it looks a little old. But, I still have to recommend it. The rosters were updated in the middle of Feb 2017 and they are close. They won't be perfect, but they will be fine for most folks. They might require a few tweaks. You can't edit or add a player but they do have a few reserves to choose from. Bottom line, it is still fun to play (with a controller).			"

												This game is seriously under rated.  I waited until it was clear there wouldn't be a 2017 version, as this is the only video baseball on PC.  This game is great, I wish I had picked it up earlier.  I hope they bring back the PC version next year as the game grows.			"
