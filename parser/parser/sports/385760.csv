												It took me a while to write this review.  I wanted to give the game ample time to get fun before I offered a knee-jerk reaction based on unreasonable expectations.  My assessment: NBA 2k17 is a supermodel.  Looks very good on the surface, but still the same dumb blonde underneath.  The most frustrating part about the game is that it comes so close to being a genuine basketball simulation, but then it decides ""nah, I'd rather act like a video game.""  There are moments when you pull of a great play and it works the way you intended and you pump your fist like it's a real basketball game.  Sadly, there are too many moments when the computer (on Superstar or higher) will simply not allow you to score and won't allow you to stop the other team when it decides ""let's make the game close so we can build a false sense of suspense, because 2K fans are too stupid to notice that we make them struggle to score in EVERY 2nd and 3rd quarter, then we flip a switch and they hit everything and they feel excited when they come back.  Cool, right?""  No 2K, not cool.  Let me blow out teams that I should blow out based on my skill level and the level of talent on my team rather than making severely overmatched teams like Brooklyn and Philly play like the Spurs because you think I want to be challenged.  It defeats the purpose of trading and roster moves and training if my guys are going to play down to their opponent every game.  Also, we notice when the AI-controlled teammates in both My GM and My Player decide their going to stand in the lane and play off deadly shooters just so the CPU can get easy baskets.  We tell the guy to play him tight, and our teammates play off anyway, cause....suspense.  We pick the guy to stop that from happening and hope our PGs can contain enough to stop the other teams PG.  They fall asleep.  We get the PG on the Pick and Roll and our center runs in place as is man rolls and gets layup after layup.  It's not fun for those of us who like defense.   The presentation of this game is beautiful--the menus, the pregame, the stat tracking--and it was a smart move to take away the silly MyPlayer angles that made that mode convoluted.  But again, the AI is too stupid for this game to pretend it's a simulator.  It could possibly trick a casual fan who sees LeBron looks just like LeBron and says its the greatest game ever, but for us die-hard hoop fans, it's like watching that beautiful supermodel stumble off the runway right before she pulls off a perfect turn.

												I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.This is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.Let's start with the positives:- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.Now, the cons:- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.- Numerous glitches.- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. I would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.			"

Available for MyPLAYER as well[From here it's more in-depth.]RETURNING PLAYERS: See below.MyPROS:    - MyCAREER immersion is the best in NBA 2K history    - Handles feel great    - Face scanning available for PC players now    - Better AI + more control over them    - Kobe and Michael B. Jordan welcome you to MyCAREER, not Spike Lee    - MyNBA2K17 mobile app hooks you up with easy VC    - Much cleaner UI    - Amazing soundtrack (if you're into rap, especially)    - Lot more player customization (animations, attributes)    - No Spike Lee    - Faster MyTEAM unpacking animations    - Dynamic Duo / Orange Juice mechanic is a free stat boost    - Very natural dribbling in between plays    - Arms are actually tangible; you touch the ball, it's out of their / your hands    - Ball isn't on a string; higher mechanics now used for offense    - Harambe logos    - Better, race-neutral MyPLAYER voice compared to the past (never mattered to me though)    - Better player celebrations    - Pres is a decent nickname, but what isn't compared to Frequency Vibrations    - No freqin' and vibin'MyTRIGGERS:    - Questionable player ratings (as of 9/20/16)    - Occasional FPS drops    - You start MyCAREER with a really low rating (as usual)    - Justice Young has better ratings than you    - MyPARK is just 3 ghost towns    - Sound is glitchy (e.g. player interview with PA going off)    - You can't make the player you want with the categorization of playstyles    - If you're a lower draft pick, you can't skip to yours in MyCAREER    - Your MyPLAYER has unforgiving attribute caps (e.g. low free throw and stamina ratings)    - The '+1 stat' you SHOULD be rewarded disappears    - No yeezys?    - Unskippable cutscenes    - Many players' faces are completely off    - Not the most hacker-proof game out there (as usual)    - You can still select 'Freq' as a nickname    - Lots of attributes for MyCAREER aren't recorded or saved    - Can be difficult to master the mechanics, especially for newer / returning players    - Spike LeeMyTIPS:    - For face scanning, use an iPhone front camera while right in front of really bright white light        * Turn slowly, and per angle.    - Lower the difficulty to:        * Rookie if you're getting crushed or are fairly new        * Pro if you're fine at the level the game puts you at initially        * All-Star if you're ready to play at a respectable level        * Superstar if you need a challenge        * Hall of Fame if you want to find out how hard of a punch your monitor can handleMyREVIEW:    - The latest installment to the NBA 2K series, NBA 2K17, is one of the better basketball games on the market ever--by default. It has a deep career mode, unlike any other game in its genre, but has once again failed to make it the best through acclaim. Its career mode--arguably the most anticipated part of the series now--tends to make critical errors annually. If you want to have the best career, then go buy 2K11. If you want to have the most IMMERSIVE career, then take this game.    - If you're new though, this game might be a headache. It's not the perfect game, it's just the ""best basketball game"" created, arguably by default. Lots of fun if you put in the work, but if you're way more casual than a lot of 2K players stick with the games that came out in the past.    - MyTEAM, MyLEAGUE/GM are back again and they've been upgraded. Had no issues with their content before (minus the actual gameplay on the COURT; that's another story), and even made adjustments to make the modes more enjoyable. (See MyPROS.)    - Several new mechanics have been introduced this year, including shot / pass aiming and the dynamic duo system. It certainly increases realism, but the game has too many other holes already for 2K to be working on something like that. (See MyTRIGGERS.) There are many issues that I'm sure you'll read about in the other reviews floating around, but the positives in tandem with them bring me to these opinions:MyTHOUGHTS:    - FOR HARDCORE 2K FANS: Must buy    - FOR CASUAL 2K FANS: Great game; best 2K since next gen graphics    - FOR NON-2K PLAYERS: Get it on sale    - FOR ALL: No Spike Lee MUST BUY $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$			"

												The gameplay aspect of this game series is getting worse and worse every year. Ever since VC became a thing 2K has turned this game into an unbearable and unfair grind, just so that you get so aggitated that you either quit playing the game or buy millions of VC to upgrade your player and buy overpriced gear and other stuff. I call it ""VC baiting"".Also with this year's edition you'll feel less in control of your player and the game itself. The presentation, though beautiful, is long winded with never ending unskippable cutscenes and animation loops. There are so many interviews, commentaries, Pre and Post game shows that you'll spend most of your time being a spectator of the game! 2K is running this show and you are their puppet!New to MyCareer is this tag-along player Justice Young. He'll be your 'friend' throughout your NBA career and in my case played the pointguard position on my team. And whenever you're on court he is and the two of you will share a Duo Super Power called Orange Juice... Yeah Orange Juice (dear goodness ). I bet an intern at 2K came up with MyCareer for this year after Mr Lee's debacle last year. Anyway... I don't want Justice on my team! I resent him (He's better than me)! I want to play with real NBA players, with only myself as a semi fictional character.I haven't even bothered playing MyPark, didn't like it last year and won't like it this year, with an army of cheaters, ball hogs, idiots, rage quiters and also spending minutes wasting time waiting to play a game.Now to be fair they have improved Pro-Am adding the much requested earning of VC and my personal wish of being able to play on court while the game searches for other players to join the match. And having AI teammates join you on your own court is also a nice touch.I'm just fed up with NBA 2K by now. I just want to play a good and fair basketball simulation and not a virtual basketball presentation game. Here's hoping EA gets its act together with their NBA Live series this year. In the mean time I think I'll just dust off my copy of NBA 2K11 and pop it in my trusty PS3.Pro's- Great visuals (The only thing you can bet on 2K delivers each year)- Nice soundtrack- No Spike Lee- Pro-Am improvements (including earning VC)Con's- VC baiting- Online Cheaters- Justice Young- A lot of waiting for animations, cutscenes etc- Control of your player often taken away from you- Unfair gameplay even in offline modes- Some players look very skinny, like KD for example			"

												Well, I can't say it's a bad game, because gameplay mechanics are great, probably the best sport game on the market. But my problem is it is getting more and more free-to-playish every year and 2K Sports seems to be doing everything they can to make us pay for VC. Getting it in the game is painfully slow and every upgrade/piece of inventory/animation cost so much. What is ridiculous is that you can pay 100 euro for 250 000 VC and that's still won't be enough to fully upgrade your player! It's 2x cost of the actual game! Also, MyPlayer feels stupid now. I don't understand the point of caps on atributes, if it's my fantasy of playing in the NBA as 2 meters tall NBA player I want him to be the best in everything. I choosed a slasher SF and for only 10 000 VC I can upgrade his 3-point shooting to whooping 59... That's gonna be probably 20% on 3-point shots :) Also 2x multiplier for playing in MyCareer on HoF difficulty doesn't work, so getting VC takes even more time. Another thing that is annoying is that all game modes use same VC, so you have to commit to one of them if you want to be really good at it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, lot's of fun, but 2K Sports gotta stop this VC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because everything in this game is made in the way, that makes getting VC slower, even cutscenes in MyCareer are unskippable, so u gotta watch your player talk on the phone with his mom about his dead father and u don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about any of them. I can recommend this game but cannot give it a positive grade because so many things are wrong about it.			"

												I've been somewhat fanatical about basketball games since my earliest years. I've been through them all, Basket master on Spectrum, the legendary Lakers vs Celtics, the whole Nba live series (until it went sour) and ofcourse 2k's Nba 2k. I still can't wait to get my hands on each version, even at 35 years old i long for the release day like a child. I just love playing basketball. Real as well as virtual. So how did 2k manage to ruin all this for me? You almost have to really try to ruin that kind of a relationship, but disregard for your player base will certainly drive away even the most religious fans. Before i start furiously ranting i still need to acknowledge the positives of the game. First and foremost, you need to realize that at its core the mechanics of the game are exceptionally good. The way the game flows, the way the players move, shoot or interact with the ball, collisions, shooting, dunking, you name it. I imagine recreating movement is one of the hardest things in game developement and 2k does its job brilliantly. You can easily distinguish players for their individual traits, like John Wall's handles, Durant's shot, MJ's up and unders. Whatever it is you're looking for, individuals are recreated to near perfection. Each team's strategy and playbook is very well done aswell and there's an integrated adapted a.i. engine that will adapt to how you play the game and it will counter and challenge your approach.Also the atmosphere in the arenas, sounds, commentary, almost everything about presentation is deliberate and exceptional. There are certain elements like the pregame show that are somewhat wooden, especially the halftime interviews, but a serious amount of dedication went into presentation of individual arenas, players, teams, the action, you name it. Granted some commentary about specific players gets annoyingly repetitive but that's mostly about the players on a team you are a part of (in my career), or you're playing mostly with. There's also a vast array of options as to what to do in this game.you literally do not have the time to explore all the game modes in depth, because the content is just massive. You can play exhibition games with current teams and rosters, you can play a story mode in my career and create your player there and play through his evolution with a story that goes along with it, you can create a fantasy team in My team, or you can play a manager type of mode if you're more into that sort of stuff. I don't have the time to go into in depth details of individual modes and i would also do some injustice since i don't play them. For the majority of people the game's most fun mode is to create a player, develop them and then play multiplayer games of streetball 3v3 in My park or 5v5 pick up games in pro-am. You can also pick a team and play in leagues with that team if you preffer that. Overall, if i would have to judge the game solely on its mechanics and presentation and the amount of content i would give it a strong 9. As for the graphics i have to say that the game engine is getting outdated and could be better, but they did squeeze out a lot out of it, and it does still look solid. So what's wrong?Well first of all, it's the bugs. It's amazing to me how the game is still flawed with similar bugs that have plagued it for years like crashes, multiplayer games not starting, etc. each year the game is very flawed at release date and does get patched out eventually but it's just not tolerable in terms of approach. Then there's the animations. Each year they claim how you will no longer get stuck in animations of players, but in fact you still do and some are just crippling and annoying as *insert word*. And each year there are cetain cheese moves that people exploit and it literally makes you wanna strangle someone because it's something that will just not happen in real life basketball very often. The most annoying one this year are the charging fouls for example. They can drive you crazy. Then there's stuff that's just goofy, like other turnovers. Sometimes you pass to someone in the open lane who's 5 metres away and the pass will go out of bounds. God forbid you should attempt passes over half the court. Even with able playmakers. While i regularly make them in real life, half of them will be turnovers here. It's just unrealistic. And perhaps the worst if it all is the amount of steals the cpu makes. Makes you wanna cringe and explode from hate. It's just ridiculously hard to pass without the cpu intercepting the ball. Especially in proam games which regularly has some a.i. players since a lot of players disconnect or have some connection problems/crashes, etc. the cpu players are also ridiculously useless as teammates most of the times. Not so much in situations where you play against ai, but when you're stuck with cpu teammates against a made player squad, you're dead. They miss easy shots, are horrible on defense... basically the a.i. is just plain bad in this game. Granted, this kind of ai is MUCH more sophisticated to program than cpu opponents in some first person shooter, but still!  Also i have to touch on the story aspect of my career. Granted it's nowhere near as horrible as last years's Spike Lee debacle, but it's still downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I hate it. Period. And now the main reason. The reason why i no longer yearn for the next year version and why i will no longer buy games from this developer/publisher. CHEATERS! Cheaters everywhere. For the past few years now the community has been losing its mind. There's so many kids who use something called a Cheat engine to raise their individual player's attributes and abilities to godlike levels where they become unguardable, it's ridiculous. They effectively ruin your experience and all the fun, yet 2k sports either don't mind or are just completely arrogant to these facts. We literally flooded them with pleads,requests,petitions, flamed them, and then some. They just DON'T CARE. It's getting worse too. I can't stand for it, i will not support such bad practice and i've never felt so unappreciated as a customer in my life. Not only that, they're also insanely greedy with micro transactions. In order to really be able to compete against other players you have to really develop your player's stats and attributes. You either grind to earn ingame value known as VC or you pay real money to buy them. But it's gonna take you considerably longer if you decide to earn enough through grind. Ofcourse some will just hack this too. To be fair, they will ban people for that kind of hacking though, because god forbid 2k shouldn't earn money from you. Until 2k changes its attitude towards the pc community and implements some kind of anti hacking measure i cannot recommend this game. I highly advise you to not support this game. Then again, you have no alternative since it's the only real basketball game and this is exactly why they behave as they do. But sooner or later they will get competition. And i am very sure most of the community can't wait till that day comes because they will be willing to pay double just to shove it in 2k's face, as long as the other product is on par with it.  I really wish i could recommend this otherwise great product but they simply do not deserve it. Stay away!			"

												The online part of this brilliant game is totally corrupted by a massive number of cheaters. 2K doesn`t care about that problem. Same procedure as every year. For the offline part (permanent internet connection still required!) I would recommend NBA 2K17. But as I bought it for online gaming, I give a negative review overall - in hope that others will do as well and 2K will care about that huge problem some day. Probably an idle wish. Before the purchase I was in doubt this year, I regret it now. As long as 2K doesn`t communicate a serious anti-cheat policy, I won`t buy another NBA product. Ongoing ♥♥♥♥♥torm needed - by use of negative reviews and ideally by a consolidation of legal and honest players that love this product and spam 2K with messages, until it won`t be possible to ignore that ♥♥♥♥ anymore. Gaming magazines don`t tell people about the unplayable online part, so gamers have to organize themselves and stop discussing with cheaters. Blame 2K. Shame on 2K, shame, shame, shame ...			"

												So after 240 hours in 2k16 and 20 hours in this, I can really say it improved in almost every point. So I am just going to make a quick pro and con list:pro:-new handle system is easy to learn but hard to master (you can really create your own combos and make some nasty ankle breakers)-graphics and sound improved even more-AI improved by a big margin-Blacktop now has people watching you play, cheering etc-the soundtrack is once again amazing-playing as a team (for me personally) is way more fun in this part-the story and the cutscenes are amazing and they seem to never stop-endorsements are awesome (you can sign with a shoe company and get your own shoe for example)-the dynamic duo system is fun-the halftime/pause shows-you can rewind the whole game in instant replay now-much more which I fail to remember right now but those are enoughcons:-somewhat underated player ratings (Isaiah Thomas, Dwyane Wade, Damian Lillard..)-already 90+ ovr players in mypark-it takes way to long imo to get a new upgrade from working out-some weird sound and animation bugs but they aren't a big contraAll in all I'd give this game a 9/10, it's so much fun and even more fun with friends. Everything looks and sounds so good that I just don't want to stop playing.			"

												First of all it's not a bad game.Im already played nearly all of nba 2k games.But it has lot of bad sides.Let's start to review;Note: Im playing this game on superstar difficulty.Pros:-It is one of best sport games i think...-Shoot meter on layups are good.-Alley oops are not easy as layup now.-MyPlayer mode is more fun i think. (It has LOTS of bad sides too)-New features like Starting in offseason and League expansion in MYGM or MyLeague, mid air lob, Roll the ball when starting play (i need some english lessons :D ), Try for dunk in post offense, Jumpshot creator ETC.-Celebrations in MyPlayer mode (It has bad sides too)-You can play good post offense.It's fun.-It is best graphics on NBA 2k series.-Better commentary.-New badges are really good.It makes game realistic.-You can plan your day hour by hour in MyPlayer.I mean you can meet with Uncle Drew and go to GYM in one day.-You can simulate stats from play minutes to simulation minutes in MyGM and MyLeague. (usually 6 mins to 12 mins)Cons:-My biggest problem is i can't play ANY of online game modes (MyPark, MyTeam, ProAm, Play now online etc) because of lag.I have about 10mbps internet ( 1 mb download per second) but i really can't play online modes.I don't know is it only for me but there is LOTS of lag for me. -MyPlayer archetypes are REALLY bad. You can't be a player like Lebron, Kyrie, MJ, Iverson etc.For example you can't dribble well and shoot threes well like Kyrie.Or you can't have lots of silver or Gold badges like Lebron or any 90+ players.If you are sharpshooter, you are only a sharpshooter.And you can only upgrade 5 badges selected by archetype.-There are LOTS of fouls in game.You almost can't steal ball without fouling from 80+ ball control players on superstar or HOF difficulty.Also there are LOTS of shooting fouls too.-I already said i can't play MyPark but taller playes dominates MyPark.Also you can't stop alley oops in MyPark.-You must use behind the back combo, between legs combo, spin moves for passing the defender.And you must use behind the back combo, between legs combo, stepback for breaking ankles.-Cpu players almost makes all of last seconds 3pters.It doesn't matter how hard is the shoot.-Defending is some hard. Cpu can defend you but you can't do it well.And if your players perimeter skill is low its nearly impossible to stop drive to basket.-2K is not even trying to fix the Graphic bugs.-Ok orange juice is good feature but it's not so useful.-Im playing x3 better than Justice but he gets more minutes than me.-I won dunk contest yaay im so happy.And what happens after ? N-O-T-H-I-N-G .No cutscenes, no rewards, totally nothing.-You must do badge hunt for some badges.-In MyPlayer you must play 12 minutes per quarter for realistic stats or being MVP etc.-In MyPlayer you can't do celebrations you trying to do.It does wrong celebration moves.That's it for now.My main language is not English.Then im not best on English.I know there is lots of wrongs in my review but who cares :D . I hope you get enough information for this game.Cya... "

												NBA 2K17: Microtransaction Product Endorsement OrgyFor some reason they left the subtitle off and just went with NBA 2K17, which is a bit misleading, since the majority of the game revolves around microtransactions and pay to win mentality.I'll give this a 6/10 for the misleading product title. In a year and a half they'll just shut down the 2K17 servers anyway, so there's that.			"

												As most of you reading this will know, NBA 2K17 is the best basketball simulation game right now. However, the reason behind this fact is that it's the only game out there and the lack of competition is hurting this game tremondously. As there is no longer any needs to make sure that its gamers would not switch to other series like NBA live, the game continues to evolve further and further away from gaming entertainment and its community. Overall the gameplay is an overhaul from the previous installment of NBA 2K16 as the player movement is becoming more and more robust, however specific algorithms of the game is getting less and less accurate in terms of simulating a real world experience. For example, contested shots are basically impossible to make in this game, meaning that the Kyrie shots over defenders are entirely impossible to simulate in this game and the difference between players are getting less and less significant and there are very few things a bench player could not do that a star player can. In fact some of the most lethal players in this game are rather low rated, but due to various reasons they are able to do the things done by all-stars to a respectable level. That itself is a little concerning as the realism of the game is not quite established.The biggest problem with this game, however, is an extremely fatal one. In this year's game, playing online -- something that is possible ever since the original 2k on DreamCast -- is basically impossible. On the steam platform, it is basically impossible to play a game online at an acceptable level of satisfaction. Not only is the server extremely unreliable, causing endless crashes that will destroy a team's promotion and records, the players on the servers are mostly unacceptable to play with. While I am sure that there exist honest, respectable players, they are overwhelmingly out numbered by cheaters, hackers and ones who exploit the system of the game. From off-balling in a my-team match to spamming steal due to the same foul-out rule in half of an actual game's time, the game itself encourages players to play irresponsibly (e.x. a player gets fouled out in an 48 minute nba game if he commits 6 fouls, or 1 foul per 8 minutes; where as an online game is only 20 minutes long and 6 fouls translate into 1 foul per 3 minutes). Much worse, hackers are able to cause their opponents to lose by crashing the latter's game app to force a loss, and cheaters are able to alter the auction house rules by bidding at less than 110% of the previous bids. With all evidence in mind, this is to say that the company has utilized their resources (mostly the purchase of gamers) into advertising campaigns instead of actually making the game more playable. This could be explained (no competition, again) but is definitely not justified. Also, this probably explains why quality players are lacking in this game, likely due to that they have given up wasting time online.Overall, the gaming experience is pleasing when offline, and disgusting when played online. For those who own nba 2k16,  the need of an upgrade is minimal, meanwhile, it is still a relatively good game if one can keep away from playing online.			"

												I no longer recommend this game because of the shady tactics designed around making money with VC sales.  They stealth patch the game mechanics, such as releases, left and right, forcing people to remake their jumpshots or start a new archetype in MyCareer because their current one got nerfed.  None of this is in patch notes, but players know their character has been nerfed by the removal of animations and what not.  The game was just patched as part of a ""roster update"" and I have not spent an extra penny past the $60 I paid for the game on VC.  Yesterday, before the patch, I made 78/89 on only 3 point shots in my gym (Sharpshooter).  I had worked for a while with the same release over the course of my 70 hours played.  Today I log on and on 2's and 3 point shots, I'm bricking everything that's not a green release; 54/107 in an open gym.  Just disgusting tactics they employ with stealth patching of the game while they sit back and collect money from people that don't mind paying to win.  I don't really play online or at least wanted to work more on the game and my badges before doing so, but this experience puts a serious damper on what was a great portion of the game.  Now just playing as the Cavs (I live in Cleveland) on game day is the only thing to look forward to.  Thanks for nothing, 2K.- signed, a lost customer.			"

												If you are looking to have an enjoyable singleplayer/mycareer experience, don't buy this game. After countless hours playing, i was disappointed to realize that MyCareer mode is essentially broken.Bugs/glitches i've encountered in MyCareer, off the top of my head:- differing/incorrect heights on players in cutscenes- No level progression on your endorsements- Trophies won't appear on your trophy shelf. this occurs after the first season- No ring/banner ceremony during your first home game if you won the previous playoff- Signed connection jerseys you receive may not appear or appear as duplicates ( I received westbrooks jersey twice)On top of that overall optimization of the game on PC is underwhelming.- ranging from constant frame stutters- cutscene/audio synchronization is totally off at timesHaving read through different forums this is an occuring problem regardless of peoples' specs.I held out hope that the 2K developers would fix/patch these problems, but so far they haven't. It seems like they are prioritizing consoles. Classic case where the PC version ends up an afterthought.As someone who enjoys NBA 2K because of the MyCareer mode, this was extremely disappointing.NOTE: I might post updates on these bugs in the comment section.

												The expectations for this game for me and all the 2K community were high but 2k made this game unrealistic to the style of playing this game (my park,pro am etc).The cheating engine is STILL here and many people especially in the park community are hacking or cheating in different ways such as badges,attributes,height etc.The last patches in my opinion did nothing to make the game better ,the servers are AWFUL getting disconected with no reason lagging etc.2k please take care of ur costumers and LISTEN to them!!The PC community are here also!!Dont be a money ♥♥♥♥♥!!

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!  (READ BELOW) IThis game has many Issues that make it not worth buying (both on PC and Console).1. (The one that bugs me the most) No Anti-Cheat At all.2. Defensive AI is poorly programmed -Players on defense will Intercept Passes they cannot see: The defending player will reach above his head and intercept a pass thats behind him, almost like Bruce Lee causing a tipped ball or steal.-Defense will leave shooters open almost for no reason (Each and every game, you must fool around with defensive settings.)-Running plays online takes too long and plays take to long to execute.3.Online modes do not work. (you must wait 30 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer to find a Online match)4. Its obvious the 2K SPORTS does not have passion in what they do, Instead the game is this a Cash Milking machine bound by micro transactions. (You lose your items every new NBA 2k game, So why shell out money for player cards?)--Spent $1000 on your MyTeam collection? TOO BAD on 2k18 it will not carryover and you must spend $1000 again.5.Cheaters on PC (No Anti-Cheat). 6.Cheesy online meta (Have 1-5 able to shoot 3s).7.Foul and And ones happen too often8.No major update since october.9.Anything else i missed.10.59.99 wastedI will not buy another 2k game again. I have played since 2k on dreamcast and I might support NBA live if they can ditch microtransactionsIM DONE!Forgive spellingAlso 2k support sucks.			"

												Ugh.... I want to like this game, I really do. But here is the thing:1. The MyCareer is a fun story BUT replayabillity is god awful. You can't skip anything. Not even like 5 minute long cut sceans,2. Stat caps make sence in MyPark BUT not in MyPlayer where if you are just trying to have fun and dominate the league, it just will never happen. You will be AT BEST the greatest 6th man to ever play.3. In MyPlayer you are the best High school star of all time and, a huge collage star...BUT you start off aginst the NBA witht he worst stats of all time. You don't deserve to be on a team. and VC is so annoying to farm, I have hardly played any of My Player just beacuse I am I wating to farm up enough VC to make myself a viable option on the team. and VC is not worth Purchesing. 4. MyPark can be fun, but with all the cheaters out there (assuing you even get players) it's very easily ruined. Also the whole you need VC to do anything problem, and I'm not rich so I can't afford any.			"

												as a hard core NBA fan and gamer, I'd suggest to avoid this game at all cost. I didn't listen to all the negative reviews and wasted $$. dont make the same mistake as mine. that being said, this game is the best NBA/basketball game one can ever get every year. for 2k17, the graphic, gameplay, music etc are all pretty decent. what makes this game dead terrible is its microtransaction. the progression is designed around microtransactions, which means is painfully slow. In order to increase the attribute of your player, you have the following options: 1.spend real money to buy VC(in game currency) on top of the $$ you already spent to buy the game to increase your attributes. for every character your want to play, be ready to spend about $70 to level it up. Want to play a shooting guard after playing a play maker guard? $70, forward? center? $70,$70....2.grind vs AI, suffer the same gameplay/animation(btw, you can't skip cutscene, and it gets old and frustrating really fast) for countless hours to earn VS, for the value about 30 cents real $$ per hour. there is no replay value of myCareer, but that's almost the only way to level up your character..3. search for glitch,cheat, bug online and use them, which pretty much all the top 2k streamers, youtubers, everyone in myPark uses. when the whole community have to either cheat or spend a tons of real $$ in order to play the game, you know there's a huge problem. You may ask, why do I have to increase my attributes? you don't have to if you just play offline vs AI. if you ever want to go to myPark and play vs real people, you'd find out that everyone there have an average attribute of 90, and your character after playing for 30,40+ hours without using cheat or spending $$ have about 65..    as long as there's pay to win microtransaction in this game, don't ever buy this nba2k or any future ones.

Presidential pardon.""If you are a person that likes playing basketball, enjoys watching basketball and understands how the game of basketball works, unfortunately this is not a game for you. All you can get is frustration from dumb CPU teammates and from cheating CPU opponents that dont care about how good your defense is. MyPark and ProAM are fun with friends, until you play against sharpshooter that makes every shot from halfcourt...I'm aware that things marked with ** are fixed with last patch (that is not live on PC yet, even though it has been on PS4 for over a week), but i stated them anyway because i think the game shouldn't have been released in this state, especially since most of these things can be seen in only 1 day of gameplay.What I would like to say, wait for few more patches, slider and tendency tweaks and then buy it on some discount, because currently it is definitely not worth the price.

												I bought this game to play with my friends.I started playing MyCareer to get my overall up. Not a bad portion of the game although really repetitive and in the long run, boring. Almost lost my 90OVR player to a glitch at the All Star Game.Then I played MyPark, which is unplayable for the most part because of cheaters.Then I played ProAm, which is still full of cheaters but before playing you can go play some real basketball with your friends, be back home, wash yourself and come back to the computer with your team still in matchmaking.Then I played MyTeam, and wasted lots of VC on packs which didn't get me anyone. Also because you'll still find cheaters making everything useless!Then I played MyLeague Online, and in the first turn of the Playoffs the game decided that he doesn't like me going to the Semifinals, so it stopped updating the results and simming games.Then I played MyGM and it was ok. Except for everyone asking me to modify the training intensity. But I think it worked ok because I didn't play a single game.Still I got to 350 hours, 200 of them being waiting in Matchmaking in the ProAm lobby.Game of the year 10/10 would buy again. (not.)			"

												I've logged close to 100+ hours on 2K17 (prerelease). I'm a career mode buff and have been attracted to MyCareer ever since 2K13 came out (that was my first basketball game, admittedly). I honestly think that I'm having a crap ton of bittersweet moments playing this game: it's realistic, it's fluid, and it makes you feel like you're watching/playing an actual NBA game. However...It's clear that 2K doesn't give a flying turd about PC users. Not only did I have to wait twelve hours for the game to be prereleased (it was released at midnight on 9/16 for Xbox and PSN, I was able to ""predownload"" it and finally was able to play it at 3 PM that same day), but I have to put up with a very important patch being released later. This is honestly one of the worst basketball games I have played, but I have no choice but to keep playing it. Why? It's literally the only thing out here. I'm ready to call for Ronnie 2K's suicide, at this point. That would be the one thing to make this entire series better.As far as gameplay goes...it has its' moments, more terrible than decent. I was drafted by the Celtics, and Al Horford took a jump shot instead of driving the wide open lane. You are immediatley double teamed once you cross half court, no matter the difficulty. The MyCareer archetypes are WAY too restricting. You are now limited to being a role player rather than a superstar. Of course, he missed with the game on the line, and I had to put the game down for a few hours. The help defense is simply laughable; half of the G.D team will flock to a pick and roll and leave two or three guys wide open. Also, the turnover system is very weird. If you throw a pass that a teammate catches out of bounds, the receiving teammate is responsible for the turnover. This is very frustrating if you catch a fast break pass along the sidelines and you are hit with this stupid, ridiculous animation and cause a turnover on yourself. I believe it was a promise by the developers that said ""lol u wont get stuck in animashuns this yeer"". And?Nope! You could be doing a swift behind the back move, be bumped into a defender, and turn the ball over. Also, spacing in the game is horrendous. More often than not, your teammates will clump themselves together at the top of the key, setting screens that nobody uses. On the defensive end, this makes it almost impossible to stay on your man, as you get jostled about far too often. Commentary gets repetetive and I've found myself skipping over the intro scenes. Also, I enjoy cutscenes and the story that MyCareer brings, but you can't skip them. I see how that could be a nuisance for some people. Defenders will also magically catch up to you if you beat them to the lane. I was driving on James Harden, who is a notoriously hideous defender, and he literally popped from his perimeter position down to the elbow. What the absolute f*ck is that? It's funny, because Demarcus Cousins is described as one announcer as having a ""shoot first mentality"", when he constantly passes out of the post and averages 7 PPG in my second MyCareer. Also, there is one animation that is literally broken. Down by 3 in the fourth, I passed to a wide open Rudy Gay, who did a stepback move (despite being beyond the three point line), and he completely missed. That's the result 95% of the time with this animation.You want a good basketball game? Wait until that scumbag Ronnie 2K cleans house of his developers and starts all over again. The MyCareer story is literally the only redeemable quality about this piece of sh*t. Mind you, I said story, not even gameplay. This game is complete and utter trash, and I highly advise that no one buy it as a gift for anyone this holiday season.			"

												Great performance on my GTX 1070. The gameplay and controls feel much more smoother and life like compared to the previous titles on Steam. And for once, the story is actually pretty good this year compared to 2K15 which was pure vomit. The story features more RPG elements, giving players more of a choice. Haven't experienced any issues so far besides a few very minor glitches that made no major impact on my perspective of the game or the gameplay itself.The UI is clean and very appealing, blacktop has been improved, playing defense requires more skill, and the game includes a great soundtrack (not that it matters much).This is the best 2K game out on the market right now in terms of realisim and smooth gameplay.Overall score on PC: 9/10My only complaint is not game related. I personally hate the way 2K as a company treats PC gamers compared to console. C'mon cuh... realize that you have dedicated fans on the PC side who don't want to subject to playing on a console. #PCMASTERRACENote: Do not let the mixed reviews fool you, a MAJORITY of the negative reviews I've read are a joke.

												First off, I had a very strong dislike for NBA 2K after 2K15 and 2K16. There were a myriad of issues that made me, a die hard fan of everything they did previously legitamately hate them as a company. I was overjoyed at reading Ronnie 2k's Instagram and seeing him get flamed hard by bitter fans. Watching 2k degenerate over the years made me wish EA did anything relevant at all with the Live franchise that was really good way back. And I am not a huge fan of EA either. But this game is different. I mean really different. Their are minor gripes and things that seem wrong but I don't even want to mention it for fear that an update would mess it up somehow. This game is the best basketball game I have ever played with not even a close second running behind. Remember 2K16 when a dominating rim abuser big like DeAndre Jordan or Anthony Davis would get the ball down low and for some odd reason throw a horrible lay up that missed? Yeah that's gone. Now punishing dunks as it should be and is in real life. Russell Westbrook is an incredible athlete and a pest defensively. Steph is dropping it in if he's open from almost anywhere. His layup animation isn't the same floating high ball everytime, either. It's crisp, it's fluid, I almost can't believe it's real. You can time steals. Let me say that again: YOU CAN TIME STEALS. It's not an instant foul like the previous versions. You can actually time it so that you can rip the ball during the opponents dribble. This shouldn't be a monumental achievement but somehow it feels like it is. Just from a basketball standpoint, it is the closest thing to NBA ball I have ever played on anything ever. As far as graphics go, I was recently watching the US Olympic team in 4k through a Comcast sampler. The camera angles where nice and the action was great. This actually looks a lot like that. And that looked better than any basketball coverage I had seen before. It's beautiful, it's fluid, again, it's almost unbelievable. Combined with the great realism and fun to play action, there has never been a game even close to this in terms of quality. I want to make it clear that I absolutely hated Visual Concepts before this game. I felt they had killed a great franchise. I felt that greed pushed them to forget about what made their game great. I was totally expecting this game to be a reskin of 2K16. I was disappointed when the game didn't release at midnight. I had set myself up for disappointment. Man I have never been as suprised as this and as thankful to have been wrong. This is an incredible achievement. It is the BEST BASKETBALL GAME EVER MADE FOR ANYTHING. Do I think it could be better in spots? Yes. Will I actually say anything about that? No. I am not lying in saying I am afraid right now that an update will somehow kill this game. It is that good. I would like to take a second to applaud Visual Concepts for dropping this gem on us. Man they took a lot of heat. But oh my goodness did it make this baby. And man, what a fine specimen this is. Please, please, please do not ruin this game. Please. I am a grown man. I am begging you. Do not kill this game. You have somehow birthed a masterpiece while being flamed from all sides. This is the diamond that emerged from that heat and pressure. Buy this game.			"

												I guess i'll give my two cents.  Since EA refuses to create any PC games, for NBA live or Madden I appreciate 2K continuing to release a PC version.  Overall I have found the game enjoyable and would recomend the game to any NBA fan.  I especially like playing the MyCareer game mode and have spent most of my time playing it.    This is the third time I've purchased an NBA game from 2K the last one being NBA 2k12.  My PC has windows 10 and a 1080GTX card I've seen a few minor graphical gliches as well as one crash but nothing major that would cause me to regret purchasing the game.If you are someone that hasn't purchased NBA 2k in a while like myself, you will most likely be disappointed when you discover the implementation of 'Virtual Currency' better know as VC.  VC is used to buy things in the game which at first doesnt sound to bad until you realize it's tied into upgrading your player's stats.  This is a common practice in free-2-play games that introduces pay walls to get people to pay for the game.  Bascially you're paying them 'not' to play the game to skip all the boring grinding game play.  Just like any other free-2-play game they've added a varitey of ways to get small amounts of VC for free in the game, but not enough unless you plan on playing for several hours. In Mycareer they introduced player practices that allow you to do a variety of things to help unlocking upgrades as well as give small increases in attributes.  This is the grind mode of the game that you will want to skip at some point once the newness wares off.  If you want to go back and create a new player to try out the different positions and skills sets offered in the game you'll be stuck with the same routines wanting to reach for your wallet to avoid playing this part of the game.  If this was a free-2-play game I wouldn't complain to much since this is how the development team gets paid for their work. However NBA 2k17 is not a free-2-play game why is VC tied to upgrading a players attributes for a game that I've already paid for?  Cosmetic content I can see, but player attributes?  Really?  It seems like a very shady buisness practice to suck more money out of players.  Even worse gives 2K incentive to add in boring grinding pay walls that no one wants to play.  VC is not cheap either if you want to start out fully upgraded expect to fork out another $50 dollars.  "

												Just a quick first impression review.Pros:Plenty of added small touches and improvements from 2k16.  Overall feel is much more fluid.  Traveling is a thing now.  A nice addition is the ability to control Denver in game as well, adding some nice dynamic plays you can pull off together. Most notible to me is the animations of putbacks off the boards, very sick.  Tons of variety of practice settings if you choose to capitalize on them, a bit too many though for my taste.  You can litterly spend more time in practices than in game if you do all of them.   Face Cam!  Hard to get a good scan but well worth it, in the end, looks really good.Cons:Ref's can be a bit derpy at times and get in your way then stand over you causing you to keep getting tripped up leading to out of position downgrades, not too common though.  Buying skills now follows a webstite format of adding to cart then purchasing.  I don't really like it because you can't see the total in cart until you go to checkout.All in all, having a great time playing and look forward to getting later into the season.  If you liked 2k16 I don't see how you won't like 2k17.			"

I hope so, and i can make it. Btw i recommended this game for the fun and for some good people in. The graphics are unbelieveble and his the better sport game for now.

												Hitting 60fps on 3440x1440p with all high settings including a 4 on AA. Running GTX 1070 FE and I-6700. First time I have ever bought the game for PC and dam it is a huge step up. Graphics and no lag. My son has 2k for PS4 and now I have to throw him off my computer because he sees the truth.I run this game on a SSD and that makes a huge difference. I mean there are no load times and instant menues....man PC gaming destroys console.			"

												Personally, this is not the terrible game all those bad reviews wants you to think, not at all.It's been a long time since i played a basketball videogame, I've bought all the NBA 2Ks from 2k9 to 2k12, then I just fed up and moved on for a few years. NBA 2K17 convinced me to come back, and it did a damn good job about it.This series of games is allways been full of content, it has tons of gamemodes for every type of basketball fan to enjoy.First and most important of them all: MY CAREERThis mode lets you ascend to basketball greatness through a rookie that you can create and customize to your tastes. Apparently, in the last few games they tried to add some kind of story to the mix, with some mixed result. Yes, the dialogue is kind of cringy, the cutscenes could have been better, and your mom is a pain in the ♥♥♥ (didn't mean to offend you, sorry). But overall, i really liked it. Michael B. Jordan as your partner for a dynamic duo is a great idea and it works really well, I liked how they worked this thing in, I like how you can actually form some kind of team chemistry, which is at the core for the finest basketball. Sure I couldn't care less about my character's girlfriend, and the whole president nickname thing was just, DUMB (wait, was this related to the elections somehow? Whatever I'm not even American), but I coudln't get enough of Justice Young and of the Orange Juice, hell, even Denver is funny at times, I really cared about him being in the team. Basically, all the story aspect actually related to the sport worked really well.Attached to MyCareer there is the infamous MY PARK:I don't play it that much, but I think it's fine. You can get some entertaining games out of it, challenging other players is allways fun. There is a faction system, there are tons of events, they know how to get players to come back for more.Everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the player caps they introduced to avoid 7 foot tall basketball demigods and yes, they could have tweaked them a little bit better: some classes are more rounded than others and can handle more things better.Personally I play in the park with an undersized 5.8 ft slasher point guard, witch is probably the worst build ever, but I'm totally fine with it. This was the closest from my real life playstyle of basketball, so just like in real life I put all my skills into play, and just like in real life I win sometimes, I get kicked in the ♥♥♥ other times.Another mode is MYGM/MYLEAGUE:In this mode you can choose to play as an entire NBA franchise, with whatever play style you want.If you either want to be a manager, be a coach, or just send your favourite team to a 82-0 record win streak, you can do that in this mode.Me? Well I'm too late to give Kobe a 6th ring, so I'll just give Derrick Rose his first one (♥♥♥♥ing love D-Rose man).Another fun thing to do here is just to simulate up to 2070s and see how the NBA has evolved, who won what and all that stuff. It can be a nice experiment for a couple of hours.Then there's MYTEAM:I don't have much to tell about this mode because i barely played it so far, I might update. Basically, you just create and customize a team, you can give it a name, a logo, a stadium, customize the jerseys, hire the players.But, you do all of that, by collecting cards. I don't like collecting cards so, whatever.The last one i can think of is PLAY NOW:You can just set up a quick game offline against the CPU or a friend, or a long ♥♥♥ online game, witch is going to take forever because nobody is playing this ♥♥♥♥ing mode. Maybe because it lags, a lot. My park is full of players and it doesn't lag nearly as much, what the hell.Honorable mention to the soundtrack, I really appreciated it. Finally some diversity, different genres instead of the same ""yo-yo i'm playing basketball homie!"", which was fun when i pretended to be black (was that racist? I think it was racist). The tracks are really up beat, which I really like, some tracks are not even in English (German singing is pretty cool) and there's Imagine Dragons, IMAGINE DRAGONS! Believe it or not this was the reason I decided to come back to NBA 2K.  I love Imagine Dragons!Overall, is really solid and enjoyable. The wrongest thing that you could tell about this game is that it is not worth the money: sports games are probably the best dials you'll find from a videogame point of views, the amount of content this game has is incredible. You could spend dozens if not hundreds of hours in a single gamemode without getting tired of it.Being a sport game though brings a big flaw to the package, which is why this game is being teared apart: It's an yearly release. That means that the developers don't have time to fix the problems this game has, they're already working on the next one. And trust me, this game has some flaws, I didn't mentioned that many because my review is already long as it is, and the other reviews, made by the fans who buy this game every year, are a lot better than me at pointing the flaws.But a fan can ♥♥♥♥♥ at both actual problems and changes to the formula, they might not like those changes, but they're stuck with them until the next game comes out, which might not even resolve the problem they had to begin with.I can understand that, but for me it's not a good reason to be so butthurt, that's just childish. If you're tired of the game, just don't buy the next one for a while, just like I did. I came back now and I'm liking the same thing you're hating so much.So, in the end, because this is taking long enough, if you're a fan of the series and you're considering this game, or the next one, who knows, consider both what are the innovations and what are the flaws, if It's not worth it for you, just skip it and wait until you're going to miss this beautiful sport. In the meantime, you might want to try it in real life.			"

												Squeeze that orange! Overall the game is better than 2k16, graphics, gameplay, storymode are quite good.Sound has few bugs, some players have invisibles arms, but it is ok, it does not affect the gameplaythe main issue for me is the fact that now we cannot do the player we want in Mycarrier (You need to select a specific layout) witch does not give me the freedom of doing what I want. also, Free throw, what have you done?

												Thumbs Down since i play a lot of my park and theres No anti-cheat or 2k didnt really attempt it on Pc.  Park is filled with cheaters. Other modes are fine, love the game but park is ruined with cheaters. 1st there the cheaters that don't care and are obvious to spot. Example- 55 overall center, dribbles like Kyrie and shoots like Curry.Then there's the cheaters that trying not to be so obvious like changing only some stats like strength, defense, rebounds, steals trying not to get noticed, but easy to spot when my center have a 76 strength and little PG with 30 strength push me out the way.

												! have quickly developed a love/hate relationship with this game.Pros-No freeqin and vibin in MyCarreer-Most game modes have been expanded upon rather than changed (especially MyGM)-Gameplay feels a bit more realistic, but still has some major flaws (see Cons)-Nice soundtrack (in my opinion)Cons-Attribute caps in MyCarreer are ridiculous! There is no way to become a ""special"" player, and that takes a lot away from the immersion of the mode. Meanwhile, the cheaters will be even better, compared to the honest players.-The mode is a huge grindfest. Unless, of course, you are willing to pay some extra, say, 20-40 bucks. Prepare for dozens of hours of grinding for VC and badges, before you can even consider playing competitively online with your MyPlayer-Jumpshots feel...strange. I don't know, it must be me, since I don't see too many people complaining about them, but this is the first iteration of the game in which I can't make jumpshots at a consistent rate. I have accumulated thousands of hours in various NBA 2K games across multiple platforms, but this one makes me throw my gamepad at the wall-Layups! You got to be ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me! A shot meter for layups? Making those in traffic is an impossible task for me, since the perfect release seems to be super early, much earlier than in previous games. -AI is totally overpowered on All-Star and up. Plus, all your AI-controlled teammates become super dumb-Although there are less bugs than last year (and a lot of legacy bugs have been fixed, for example the commentary just cutting out for half a quarter), there are new bugs that are much more gamebraking. Invisible arms and invisible menus (which require a complete restart of the computer to resolve). Plus: green faces!Some little nitpicking:-Too many injuries in MyGM- tbcVerdict: I'm a noob and should go play something else			"

												I recommend to buy this game for any NBA fan, but, there is a lot of problems.Graphically it's more or less the same than NBA 2k16, meaning ok but nothing amazing for today games.Problem number one though, even if the graphics are about the same, the framerate is two time worse, I do have to say that I did play this one on Windows 10 while I played the last one on Win7 so this might be because od Windows.Speaking of graphics, they need to take serious course on anatomy at 2k studio, yes the scanned faces are allright, yes some players really look good, but some others just look laughable, wrong body type, terrible proportion on some part of the body (in particular the whole shoulders and neck area) Gameplay wise, it's the best NBA 2k I played so far (I only played 2k14,15,16 before though)Myteam feels better than before, more rewarding, the current cards are lower on ratings on purpose to allow a longer lifespan, which is not a terrible idea even if it can feel cheap.The MyGm/MyLeague mode are refined from last year, overall they do feel better, and the league extension is a really good idea.MyCareer mode is allright so far, there is some really decent VC rewards from sponsors to be gained along the way which again make the whole mode more rewarding, the big problem is that you can't skip cutscenes! Yes The cutscenes (that are for 95% of them not worth anyone time to be honest) are forced on you, if you plan to only do one myplayer it can be ok, but if you plan on testing several archetype then you are up for at least 30 minutes of unskippable cutscenes in the first 2 hours of the game more or less, which is boring.Archetypes and the skill caps that come with them are another issue, as many have pointed out, it's almost impossible to create a real superstar player stat wise, but it has to be balanced with the gameplay that is improved and allow more freedom than before, so you will still be able to pull amazing moves even with less impressive stats.

												This is my first NBA game ever as I've always played FIFA. So for the veterans out there, ignore my opinion. For the rookies out there like me, give it a shot! I'm loving it, the story (my career) mode is extremely detailed and advanced. The more you beat a team in an away team the faster their fans walk out their stadium etc. The story mode is very immersive and responsive. Brilliant. Keep in mind, it's a long drag and most cinematics are non skippable. If you're not willing to pay about 10bucks to kick start your players' stats, you'll be in for a much more difficult and frustrating beginning of your career.As per other game modes, I haven't played enough to judge that properly. Therefore, I'd advise you to continue reading other reviews in order to cover every aspect and perspective of this game. So far, I believe it deserves a big thumps up.			"

												Don't waste your money if you are planing on playing it offline. 2K makes the offline mode unplayable! I cannot even change player’s animation in My Career Mode. To be honest, 2K just want more money and doesn't care what customers want! If you don't want to play online then there is no meaning to waste huge amount of money on VC. What they do is just making the offline mode unplayable, hoping to push customers to buy VC. Well good luck with that 2K.			"

												For the people who don't like reading long reviews here is a quick overview for you.Is it better than 2K16? YES!Is it just another sports game reskin? NO! This game feels fresh and brand new. A breath of fresh air.Should I purchase it? Yes. Its the best 2K sports game period in my opinion.Rating : 8.5/10 (will be a 9/10 once a flew bugs get fixed)OK. Now into the real reviewWe all love 2K right thats why you are here reading this correct? The  main questions alot of us ask ourselves is... Is this game better than the last game/ is it a major update worth paying 60$ for.. My answer is yes here is why.PROS1) The game overall presentation is amazing. You get sucked into the game as soon as it launches, everything feels refreshed. I haven't seen a sports game presentation this good since ESPN  NFL 2K5.2) The variety of animations make the game feel revamped and refreshing, something 2K has been needing for quite some time now.3) The Steal System/Defense mechanics are on par and feel great to use. The new system also disable the steal spammers from 2K16 it actually requires some skill to use.4) My Career so far is amazing. The whole setup in my opinion is awesome. The smart phone integration is pretty dope as well5) (Depending On Your GPU) The load times are way faster this time. So no more long long long long mypark loading screens.6) The character models look great. 7) The game is fun as hell, balanced, & fun to experience offline or online.8) MyTeam is amazing as well this year, the pack odds seem to be increased due to even higher level cards such as the return of Ruby & Onyx from 2K15.9) The shooting system/layup system is easy to get use to.10) Tons of new features which are actually fun to play/use.11) The HUGE selection of shoes, all the shoes are highly detailed this year. 12) The AI isn't dumb this year, you actually feel challenge. If you are making alot of shots expects double teams and the AI reacting aggresive towards  you which is very realistic.13) Last but not least the soundtrack is AMAZING! Alot of classics songs. I usually get bored with video game soundtracks but this soundtrack for 2K17 is amazing even better than 2K13.Cons1)Bugs that need to be patched. (fast playing custscenes & disappearing limbs time to time)2) Face scan app is GARBAGE!Final VerdictDespite semi flaws, none of them tarnish the game-play nor the game itself. The game is amazing to play, plus a quick patch could fix those little errors. If you are a 2K Gamer this 2K is a MUST HAVE! 9/10 once bugs are fix but 8.5/10 for now.			"

												Fresh Squeeze!A lot of the bad reviews are people pissy about the PC release being delayed about 13 hours, which was on Steam's end, not 2K's. The other half are people who havent update their drivers complaining about performance. Then a small sliver are the people who are actually truly having issues with the game, so be wary some are experiencing real problems but don't be put off by the low score. Game is great. You can see the hours I've put into the 2K series, including how little I put into 2k16. This is the best yet, by far.			"

												NBA 2K17,I clocked 250+ hours into this game so I think its time for a review of this game.Singleplayer:Playnow:What can I say about it nothing new, blacktop is great if you play a player they dont have their jerseys, you have a crowd. And the place its set up is actually awesome.Mycareer: Mycareer changed alot it now features Archetypes (NBA 2K17 biggest and only feature) It looked good at the trailer but I actually realised thats its bad real bad. Lets say I want to be glasscleaner eating boards, but I also want to shoot - NOPE you can't do that you cant be Demarcus Cousins or any of the great NBA centers/powerforwards. Cause I'm sure there are Shooting centers that grab rebounds, but 2K placed a cap on this so you cant shoot very well. Oh yeah, myplayer still sounds black, for the people that have problems with it, its perfectly fine for me. The Myplayer creation ugh, its AWFUL nothing new! No new haircuts but THEY gave the NBA players their good haircuts lets say Jimmy Butler, he got his haircut really good at this game but they dont have an option for us to wear it. The Story is good, why good you say? Cause its better then 2K16's. MyLeague/MyGM:This was the gamemode where I didnt find any bugs/glitches, MyGM and Myleague(Online) is still there you also have ''Start Today'' where you play as your favourite NBA team and start where the team left off with all real NBA stats, standings and injuries. you also have ''Season'' where you just play one season and ''playoff) where you play in the playoffs. They also have this new thing called ''League Expansion'' with that you can start the league with the 30 current NBA teams and have 6 extra teams! (Awesome), You can then create your own team or use a pre-built team or Download it. Myleague is just great no problems.ONLINE:MyPark:Its just like 2K16 good or bad?ITS BAD, there are hackers, Glasscleaners that can shoot 3's. Rookies with all the mypark badges and 99.The worst thing is Mypark is the same the PARKS are the same except Rivet city but that just went ugly. They dont have voicechat which is good thing or bad thing you may choose. I'm not even talking about park anymore. NEXT!let me say one more thing its capped at 60 fps!ProAm: Its cool, no hackers found yet and there are actually people in it, its still hard to find but better then 2k16.MyTeam: Packluck is alot better then 2k16 you get better card wayyy better.Playnow Online: I wanted to try it once but after 5 minutes searching for a player, I gave up. I'll update this when I actually played it.GAMEPLAY: Gameplay is really smooth, alot smoother then 2K16 you cant spam skillmoves anymore cause your player will get tired you actually control the skillmoves and its now not who can spam its now who can control the sticks better. I thought they fixed that double team glitch but its still there anyone tell me?Graphics:Graphics are amazing a huge improvement from 2K16 I also see the emotion from players. I play this at Ultra settings and it looks amazing definitely a + for them. It runs buttery smooth.But this is really annoying,This is grindgame a VC/attribute grind game. MYCAREER is so grindy its really annoying it took forever to upgrade my playmaker and they actually force you to buy VC cause grinding on MYCAREER is to annoying but yeah its 2K.And this is my review: Score: 8/10 fix the damn game 2K.Should YOU get it? For this price now wait for now, when its on sale for like 30 bucks or sumthing.But I do recommend it. "

												A huge dissapointment. After all these years of development the game remains mostly unchanged with the same gameplay problems and limitations. Every once in a while they change the menus presenatation and add/remove a few features while ignoring main issues such as player IQ , the players' abillity to just HANDLE and/or CATCH is ridiculous , euroleague teams are a joke, they didn't get any attention			"

												Having played the hell out of 2k16 I can say 2k17 is a nice upgrade. The more you play the more you can appreciate all the little touches they added weather its the fluid animations or commentary which helps make it play and be more enjoyable. Only annoying things is the new shot meter which goes to the full bar instead of half from last year and also shot meter for layups but I got used to it after a few hours			"

												They made the game about a ""social"" kind of thing, where you have to constantly be in contact with your coach, your family, your team and what not, it's very annoying, overall the game pushes you to do ANYTHING but play basketball. You can't skip cutscenes, must wait for certain animations to be over, can't cut through the coach telling you what to do. I DO NOT CARE, I JUST WANT TO PLAY!The gameplay improved, but all this non-sense really makes it difficult to play the game. It's just not worth it.			"

												The good things you can see for most other comments and reviews. I do like the 36 teams expansion in gm mode tho. I don't play MyPark that is just trash.MyCareer/ MyTeam Negatives.Negatives:-AI cheating/cheese . -Annoying coach and ""season ranking/stat""s popups in game still. -Ai teammates cannot rebound with letting the ai get  offense rebound and foul him almost everytime down the floor.-0 help defense.The ai on your team like Justice will constantly get in your way-Free Throw/Stamina bug of not getting your mycareer character free throw/stamina  up .-Ai will really only guard the player nonstop. Its almost impossible for me to get around my pick and roll because the defense literally cuts me off every single time.-Ai hits almost every shot. Its like they are all super nba stars and not regular nba players that miss shots.-Get hit 20 times in one drive to the basket and no call.-Opposing Ai player fell outta bounds with ball in his hand with nobody near him on he opposite side of the court. The ref gave them the ball back.wtf-Ai moving screens.This is a huge problem-Practices are super annoying to go to every damn day.-Ai in the paint for like 12 seconds and get the call about 1/10 times-dribbling moves are always terrible in all the games and relies on it way too much.-Teammates take like 2-4 times pressing to throw ball to you and you throw it to someone on accident and get a turnover.Happens every single game. They are very slow passing you the ball and you lose your advantage and have to do a bad shot or pass out.-AI makes too many free throws. The home ""crowd "" effect does not work on ai .-Justice is a ball hog and the plays mostly go to him doing isolation. I cannot figure out how to change my play calling. I could just be missing it. I have it on auto playcalling because Im sg.-When you try to pass when you stop with defender on you its a turnover. When you ask your teammate to pass and they get stopped its turnover.- I have a decent shooting and i can barely ever make the shot . I have been 2 ft from basket shot almost a green and it misses in games. Can shoot in practice fine.-Hate the timer for layups/dunks I cannot even see that crap in 2k view.-Wish the shooting mechanic was not joystick timing period. -AI holds you in paint and makes you get turnover when in reality that is a clear as day foul.-AI cheats by getting timeouts and when you skip the timeout they make you still on the bench sometimes-Your teamates get steal or control of the ball the ai takes it back within half a second.-Players that dont have post moves make shots with them.-Ai gets charges on you for you going ""left "" and him going ""right"" with him coming up on fast and running into your side. Also i've been called for charge many times on the edge of the floor when that is a blocking foul..NOT CHARGE!-CANNOT CHANGE DIFFICULTY TO PRO in MyTeam. This is the dumbest thing.  The AI bonuses are  so lobsided against you.- Ai gets way to many Offensive rebounds that needs to be cut in half on higher difficulties.- AI gets too many blocks with crappy players.- AI passing lane steals are about double the length of their body.- Ai opponents have the best ball handling and passing. Turnovers should happen WAY more for them.- Ai runs faster on higher settings.- AI making contested layups are extremely annoying.I just want a relaxing pro difficulty or fair all star (no ai cheating) for all the game, but in MyTeam I have found it is the worst. Right now i see this game as waste of money. GM mode/League is fne because you can tweak it to be fair. The rest however is nothing but CHEATING ai. I have so much ill will towards the developers and most of it to the ai programmers. I would do bad things to them if i had the choice.			"

												My Career mode: I am really frustrated. It was really promissing with the archetypes etc. Playing the game I realise that at your potential you will never become as good as the top NBA players... So what's the point? I am playing a game and I want my player to become as good as possible! My Park: Well... missing free shots with good release... Opponents hitting shots while I am all over them... What's the point again? What do I have to do? SF position is destroyed, cause you either are too short to grab a rebound from a center or too slow to dribble off a pg/sg who defends you. As a player who has spent about 900 hours in 2k15... I really must say that it was WAY more fun even if hacks were all around... On the positive side, I must admit that the block animation is really improved as well as the tattoos you get on your player. Not much more improvements in my taste since 2k15 and I really feel my money weren't well spent here.			"

												Everything seems pretty good so far. The game runs well (no bugs/crashes that I'm aware of), decent graphics, good gameplay, lot of good options, and it's fun to play.The game works well with a Dual Actino Logitech controller (older version is the one I have I believe).You can even download other game floors/uniforms that others created. It has various optiosn in game for creating things as well, but I haven't checked those out yet.The My team feature iss pretty fun to play. In regular season mode you can add a custom team logo/uniform/stadium (like the Sonics). I'm not sure if that team/others are available to add to a league though, but there is a roster editor in game.			"

												Very enjoyable game, alot smoother then previous titles and a very good, and unpredictable story for mycareer. My gm and my league has gotten updates to where the nba board meets and changes rules such as ""goal tending is allowed"" or ""players cant enter the draft until theyre 21"", its unrealistic but its insanely fun. stamina depleats and it makes substitutes valuable unlike previous games, you will really feel the tiredness of the players in the 4th quarter as they slow down, become less agile and worse at ball handling. In other words nba fans have one of the best sports games to play, whether its creating your own team from scratch in my team, handling real teams in my gm, or becoming a legend in my career, its all fun no matter what game mode you play. If you watched an nba game in the pass 15 years this title is a must buy, see you on the courts.			"

												After giving it a lot of playing time and thought, I sadly cannot recommend this game. The way 2k has designed the Myplayer mode is far too limiting, and there are aspects of it that make it seem like a complete money grab. 2k and game developers/publishers in general, please understand that your desire to squeze every last dollar you can becomes counter productive when you ruin the experience of one of your most popular game modes. Good luck selling copies with a 52% overall score! You're nickel and diming people while you could  have created a fun product that will sell at $60. Its a shame because the actual basketball part of the game is the best i've played in my opinion.			"

												As a basketball game, I rate it 10/10, simply because there is no competition. But as a AAA title game....man....It's 2016 and we still have unskippable cutscenes. While there are tons of game modes and features, most of them require lots of grinding like MyCareer and MyTeam. The input lag is still there as most of the issues from 2k16 are. Would recommend this game just because there is no other basketball game to play, but if you are just looking for a game to play, I would not recommend this.			"

												The Mycareer Mode is simply a joke. Earning VC is very hard and the attribute lock in each classes don't make the game very fun to play. The opponent team drops an ♥♥♥ full of threepointer, while your teammates still walk behind their defender if you try to pass them the ball. The training part is the most boring an uncreative piece of gameplay i've ever seen. I mean, they still want me to buy vc for real money, sell a box with a download code as a full price game and then this?!Of course, everything in the game looks beautiful and the sfx are brilliant but it's simply not a good game.The Story with Michael B.

												So this game is no 2k10-13 (these were the best 2K games IMO). But I must say that compared to the last 3 years of the same game being recycled with updated rosters and graphics, and that horrid Joint with Spike, 2K didn't do a bad job on this one. The game mechanics for the most part feel very fluid and natural, and the enviornments are improved to feel more alive. MyCareer is a huge improvement to the last 2 years, although it lacks much of a story line, you actually feel like a pro with continuous visits and texts from teammates, your best friend Justice(Michael B. Jordan), coaches, and players around the league. In addition, you have to make certain decisions with you endorsements, and they feel pretty rewarding and something to work towards. WARNING: The difficulty of this game has been increased. It can be frustrating as you have to link dribble moves together to be effective. It is much harder to break ankles and get space for shots, and now you actually have to adapt to the game and read defensive schemes. But when you do make a great play and that time that you actually do blow by a defender it feels extremely gratifying. All-In-All I recommend this game to any fan of basketball as it truly is a step-up from recent years of 2K and offers a challenge as well as entertainment.*UPDATE*: I originally got the game for the love of basketball and something to kill time. 10 days after recieving it I have now realized how week of a community this game has. It is nothing against anybody playing this game (except hackers), but I wanted this game for the occasional ""turn on my computer between classes, play a quick my team matchmaking game or mypark to show off my roster or progress respectively, then turn it off"". The thing is, I end up in empty My Parks and find myself waisting 5-10 minutes hoping to find an Online My Team Match with absolutely no luck... I love the game but wish the online community was even a 1/4 as strong as consoles (especially cause of how many community threads have been created). Oh, and have had no luck finding Play Now games or My Team Blacktop. Severely dissapointed I paid full price to have no Online community. Only recommend it because of what I stated above and if by some miniscule chance enough people get it, I might actually start seeing people Online.			"

												I absolutely regret buying this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. It has literally no improvements from last year, the dominance of 2k, however, continues.Pros:-It's a basketball gameCons:-Stupid extra animation that makes defender block ur shot every single time- The defence of AI is too good, unless u make a play , u can't do anything. Even when u are Isiah Thomas against Javale Mcgee, u still can't get pass him.Which in reality is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Literally every pg can blowby a center-When u get too close and run u will just call for a charge. Have u seen LeBron draw a charge at mid court? Impossible, I didn't even push him during the animation and I was called for a charge.-shot meter is garbage when the games want u to get green u get green when the game doesn't want to u to get green release u won't get green release- the story force u to be an american I know the majority of the players are American but still, c'mon man!- Paid to win. The time to get high overall rating to to high-Help defence is stupid -Justice Young is too overpowered u can't win against him in practice. -Why does the coach have to call a time out everytime I was subbed in -Practice takes to long to progress.-Unskipable cut scence and the 5 min long opening scene-The accessories and shoes is too ♥♥♥♥ing expensive- The passing system is garbage and should be redo-The teamate grade is so ♥♥♥♥. I got minus a grade for a TO and 1/4 of grade for an assist?WTFOverall , this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. The only reason I'm still playing this is becasuse there's no other basketball game out there. I really hope EA bring back a good NBA live so that there will be competition. Everytime I play this game I go full on rage mode. I don't suggest anyone buying this game as the patch won't fix most of the issue. The gameplay is definitely lack luster and is so different from real life. Please do not buy this game unless u have too much money or desperate for a basketball game. I would like to refund this game but I only know how bad the game was after 2 hours. But the steam refund only avaliable in 2 hours so I coudn't refund this crap. Hope my review could help u guys. (I seriously rather playing 2k12 or 13 the gameplay were wayyy better, next-gen just add more ♥♥♥♥ animation which is useless at improving the game)			"

												I would say that I have decidedly mixed feelings about this game. There are times when it's a lot of fun, but those moments are, ultimately, overshadowed by the game's more frustrating aspects. The Good:The game's franchise mode, ""MyGM,"" has a lot of depth to it, and compares favorably with the franchise modes in most other sports games. Within MyGM, there are a lot of options for different ways to simulate games, including several that allow you to partially sim a game, jumping in and out of the action as needed. This is something that is overlooked in a lot of other sports games, and it goes a long way towards making it possible to actually get a lot out of the franchise mode without having to put in more time than you really want to. The graphics are very good, though that comes with the significant caveat that even on very high-end computers, the framerate becomes unacceptable unless you turn the graphics settings way down. But even on the lower graphics settings that you end up playing on, the game still looks great.The coaching options within games are great. I love the ability to give my team instructions during timeouts and it doesn't take very long to get used to navigating the different coaching menus that are available during the game, during timeouts, and when you pause the game. Having a bunch of classic NBA teams, as well as international clubs, is a really nice touch. The ""rubberbanding"" seems to have been significantly reduced this year, if not elimated altogether. This was probably single biggest improvement the game needed to make, so I'll definitely give props to the devs for that!The presentation is very good. The menus look good and are easy to navigate, load times are quick, and the soundtrack is excellent. Areas for improvement: 1) the lineup annoucements at the start of the game feel very stiff and robotic. Each name, position, etc. is read off in exactly the same way, with the same intonation, spacing, volume... even the crowd's cheering is the exact same for every player. 2) While the soundtrack is, again, excellent, the over-the-top censoring of the lyrics is super annoying. Either choose songs that aren't explicit, or don't censor them. Cutting out every other word of a song (including words like ""thugs"", ""steal"", and ""E"") is just obnoxious. The Bad:Too many actions are mapped to the same controller input, or an input similar enough that you're likely to do the wrong one by mistake. The game relies heavy on contextual actions, with the computer deciding what it thinks you meant to do based on the situation. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence isn't yet where it needs to be in order for this sort of system to work smoothly. It works pretty well most of the time, but there are reasonably frequent instances of ""I wanted to do a layup, not a jumper!"", or ""I wanted to do a hesitation dribble, not a shot!"", etc.No option to turn off the pregame show, halftime show, or--most annoyingly--the in-game infographics. Sometimes the game will be interrupted for 20 seconds while they show a stupid pie chart with some stat I don't care about, and I have to wait for it to go away before I can continue playing the game. The shameless advertisements for Gatorade. ""You know, Kenny, one really underrated advantage to timeouts is that it gives the players a chance to get some Gatorade. It's so important to stay hydrated, and these players aren't going to play as well late in the game if they don't take the time to replenish their electrolytes during the timeout. They need to refuel with Gatorade in order to play their best."" ""I couldn't agree more.""The commentary. It's not necessarily worse than other sports games, but the gaming industry as a whole just hasn't made the kind of investment into good commentary that it needs to. One specific shortcoming is that the commentary seems to be triggered by the outcome of a play, rather than how it actually went down. A player might shoot a ridiculous falling-out-of-bounds three-pointer just over the fingertips of the defender, and they'll say ""How could they leave him so wide-open?! That's just lazy defending."" But if a wide-open shot is missed, they might say ""great defending on that play! they made sure to get a hand in his face and force a bad shot.""The game is heavily lacking in the realm of instructions. There are a lot of game mechanics--including even the controls themselves--that aren't explained in enough detail, or aren't explained at all. I've had to do way too much googling to try and figure out how different parts of this game work--and in many cases, I haven't been able to find an answer at all. The Ugly:The coins/microtransactions system seems to pervade every inch of the game, and it feels like every design decision was made with the microtransactions system in mind. For example, in MyGM, there's no ability to save your game or load an old save. The game autosaves frequently, and that's the only save you can use. I even tried copying off the save file (in my filesystem, outside of the game) and loading it back in later (without modifying it at all), only to have the game throw an error that the file was ""invalid"" or ""corrupted"" or something like that. Presumably, this is to stop people from somehow exploiting saves to get coins, or something stupid like that. But as someone who couldn't care less about the stupid coins, it's just annoying. If I want to reload my save if I lose a game, I should be able to--it's my freaking game. Similarly, there's no ability to turn off injuries once you've started a franchise. So, you can be 10 years into your franchise and decide that you're tired of dealing with player injuries, and your only choice would be to start over from scratch, with injuries turned off. Again, this is presumably to stop people from turning off injuries instead of paying coins to heal their players. Every mode of the game is completely oriented around the coins system. In the MyGM mode, for example, you spend coins to improve your franchise, to keep your players happy, to scout opposing teams, to keep your players healthy, to improve your chances of signing players, to improve team chemistry, and so on. Passing. The passing is absolutely, inexcusably terrible. It's beyond frustrating, and you'll find yourself passing to the wrong person more often than not. And for those people who counter by saying ""you should use icon passing,"" the fact is that icon passing is too slow, not an option in many cases (like when you're already in mid-air), and not a good excuse for the lack of basic functionality. The fact is that they've dedicated three buttons on the controller just to basic passing (not even counting icon passing, or the double-press or long-press inputs)--and none of them work well enough. The passing controls in this game sound fancy and elaborate, but that doesn't mean a thing if you can't quickly and reliably choose which player to pass to. No physics system, or a very bare-bones physics system. The game does not appear to utilize a physics system. Instead, the game seems to rely on preset actions and animations. For example, you can lliterally run circles around a ballhandler while they stand still at the top of the key, dribbling, and it is not possible to run into the ball or knock it away. The only way to steal the ball is to press the input for ""steal"", at which point the game will do some calculation to determine whether you knock the ball away, commit a foul, or just swipe and miss. No out-of-bounds forcefield. Players will happily sprint headlong out of bounds, which is a problem because staying in bounds ends up demanding a level of precision that we simply don't have with our combination of controller + camera angle. As a result, baseline drives are all-but-nonexistant.  "

												A little more the same but some additions which i personally do not like. It's decent but not incredibly compelling. I cannot say I would recommend it and having bought every single nba2k game since 2k9 (when it came to pc), I find myself seriously considering whether or not to get the next one. Do note that most of these comments are directed at mostly single-player MyCareer gameplay which is the feature I found/find most compelling and fun. It's not intended to apply to online multi-player play which I do not do enough of to form any informed opinion. A big sour-note for some time from the series is how MyCareer has pretty much become you playing out a story written by someone else. While some of the stories have been interesting most of them are cliched and pigeon-hole you into some one's idea of what a baller should be. If there is going to be a story about my career, I would want MyCareer to be my story and one that I can choose for myself - not live out someone else's fantasy. In many ways. the older MyCareer without so much story-mode was so much more open and dynamic. With the last few iterations, it's always the same old story - high school phenom, such a nice person, yada yada yada. At least, the story a few iterations back (about not being drafted and having to work to find a team) was compelling (and also fit the starting stats they gave you). The recent ones including this one have literally all been such a drag. Which brings me to my first comment: -1. You can't skip the cut-scenes! If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd watch a movie. I just want to play. Granted that some may enjoy these but I'm sure there are many like me who don't. Just give us the choice to skip through the cut-scenes at least after the first play through! Sometimes I like to re-roll a player, I like having different permutations/builds and players in different positions. Sitting through 3-5 minutes of cut-scenes every 6 minutes is terrible. 2. Not sure what they did to the movement/running mechanics but controlling a player feels like he's running on ice or has his feel stuck to the ground. The addition of momentum/inertia et al is well and good, but i figure that if a player is playing a college level (much less NBA-level), he should generally be able to run where he wants to. 3. A crap-load of illegal moving screens by the pc. Last instalment got too whistle-happy with the illegal screens, this one seems to forget it all together. 4. Not sure I like starting out MyPlayer pigeon-holed with the archtypes they think are appropriate. For once, I would be able to like to choose some starting skills/badges instead of being pigeon-holed. The whole best player in high school/lottery pick but starting out at 55 player rating is getting old. Either do away with the super baller rheotoric or do the stats some justice. 5. The practice routines start out ok, but become a serious grind after a while. The routines also need to be more varied and positional. It's ridiculous to expect a PF/C to go one-on-one with a star guard or take threes all the time. That said, after you've been playing for a while, it can get incredibly monotonous which while perhaps realistic is not the quite of simulation 2k was hoping for. 6. While the concept of having a buddy on court sounds great, I'm not too thrilled with the whole Justice Young thing. Firstly, this guy who supposedly couldn't even break into the 1st round draft because 'teams were put off by his size' comes out from the blocks having an 89-rating (my player got drafted by the Raptors, Kyle Lowry's a 88, this MBJ-clone is an 89 ... so much for immersion and credibility). Game-breaking much? Secondly, this developer-created guy is taking valuable minutes from legit real-life players. There's really only room for ONE imaginary player in MyCareer. Would have been more interesting if they made you earn the buddy with chemistry or something else with an existing player.			"

												My Career was ♥♥♥♥ poor due to the many bugs and the cap introduced on your My Player. On top of this My Career felt more like Justice's Career not My Career, the dynamic duo system wasnt all that good. It actually took away the feeling for me.... If your gonna introduce a cap to the game, make My Career different from your competitive gameplay.  Also why is there still no team up like the one we had back in Nba2k12??? Has this not been requested every year? I wish Nba LIve would take 2k's throne, they need something to work for they are just lazy with their games now-a-days. And on a final note this game has become more pay to win than ever!			"

												I found this game to be much better than 2K16, and I have about 80 hours logged of 2K16. The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable - I didn't experience any glaring issues or frustrating gamemplay mechanics such consistently missing open shots or inability to play defense like in previous editions.The biggest issue is the optimization. Theg graphics will strain your system and I am currently playing on pretty low settiongs.However, the gameplay is fun.			"

												The game itself is fine but it crashes all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. It crashes when loading MyCareer, it crashes when loading the main menu and it crashes in between MyCareer games. I've seen a lot of people have this issue and there seems to be no fix. The last time the game was patched was mid October so clearly 2k have no intention of fixing it any time soon (or at all).This is completely unnacceptable for a game that doesn't drop in price until the next one hits the shelves. This is the first and last 2k NBA game I will be buying.FYI - the pirated version is MUCH more stable, if you haven't bought this game, torrent it.

												This review is about MYCAREER MODE .I was legend in NBA 2K16.(One of the top ranks of game) So I know how this game works.First of all. This game is 2K16's side story mode. I am not kidding. 2K thinks If they change the story we won't notice nothing was changed.  I am BASKETBALL FAN. But I dont wan't any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story in a BASKETBALL GAME. I am not here for the story. I am here for the BASKETBALL. Cons*Getting your overall up is very very hard. 2K wants you to pay money.( You dont have to but you must. )Getting badges is important but getting them is impossible.New shot meter is broken.Your team sucks and other team is killing your ♥♥♥ no mater what.( Well at least this ain't new. In 2K16 it was like too. Yay.You have to spend hours and hours in gym. I mean you are playing 1 match for like 20 and you are going to gym for like 40. Yeah , And I ain't joking bro.When your team calls a timeout you cant skip it for 10 seconds. You have to watch your coach speaking . And it is same in every modaf*kin match.You gonna feel like you are playing against your team no matter which team you play on.(except GSW and CLE)New mypark ranking system sucks.Pros*New layup shotmeter is coolIt is like 2K16 "

												Much Better.We are all familiar with the 2k series and 2k17 aimed to improve many of the aspects of the previous titles.NBA 2K17 is a huge improvement over the previous titles.Lets start with the bad.Still some issues with movement and direction. The controlled character may get stuck at times with bad collision with other players. (i have to give 2kprops this was a huge problem in the last title, that is now a minor one).Unskippable cut scenes.The long standing issue of being penalized in team rank score, for playing help defense is a long standing issue that has been in many titles.The AI likes to pass you the ball when you run close to them which creates congestion.The AI needs to better determine when you are open. (its acceptable, not great.)The good.The acting has bee vastly improved.It also seems like someone with a brain wrote the script (they appropriately avoid stereotypes and is appropriate no matter how you created your custom character.)SHOOTING NOW MAKES SENSE! Finally a shot percentage system that is more reliant on making plays and skill.The graphics, especially they realistic movements.Honestly there are so many mechanics that have been vastly improved its not useful to go into them.What you need to know is that 2k is finally on the mend from 16 and 15.

												This game is getting an unsusal amount of hate imo.most of my experience thus far stems from Mycareer modeGame is pretty solid minus a few glitches but i haven't seen anything game breaking yet. my career is MUCH better than 2k16. Not racist for one... *cough cough* spike lee *cough* Also I feel I have much closer ties to the character and player interactions.that being said you are pretty locked into your character personality as ""pres"". Part of me would like to develop my own persona but i suppose its easier to make a better story with some things being pre-set.I do like how they revamped practice. It really makes everything you do feel natural.my one BIG negitive though... and this is subject to change here. but what I have seen from Mypark it seems its pretty much barron. DOA. I dont know why this is but i ran around for a while to see all of one or two other players. I'd love to tell you about the quality of the online matching but as your probably could figure out I have not had the chance to try it really.that and VC... really wish that wasn't a thing... I know not a lot of people care about this but this restricts a simple feature id really love to have. I just want to watch the team im GMing without actually having to play. much like watching a basketball team on TV.

												The last sports game I have played before this one, was NFL2k1 on Dreamcast.I bought this game mostly for MyCareer, and I loved Michael B.

Even though I did not play a sports game in the last few years (15) I picked-up the control easily, and I love how easy it can be at first and then realize you can do much more than you thought, I love the mechanics, though not always easy, the learning curve is not too bad for a noob like me.MyCareer:About 10 hours in MyCareer, I chose Georgia Tech as my starting team and was drafted 11th in the first round by Orlando's Magic. The dynamic duo thing is going on and the story is quite fun so far.Face Scan:Not so easy to do at first, but once you get it, the result is quite, well, creepy and spectacular, I was tired when I took the pictures and my avatar looks always stoned in-game, but that's a lot of fun to watch, very enjoyable.I did not play the other MyWhatever so far, I intend to do so once I get tired of MyCareer, but so far it's quite fun, except maybe all that training :)8/10			"

												If you want to play a basketball game with ghosted players in other words you cant see them on the court but they can hold the ball look no further cause 2k17 will offer you that. If you want to play a game that has no online but claims there is an online 2k17 offers that as well. 2k17 also offers something extremely unique which is hackers, I thought hackers get punished, not in 2k17, if you hack you are more than welcome to play. Since all of this sounds great to top it off you will crash about 40 times in an hour of a gameplay, dont blame your computer like me and try to find solutions cause steam wont refund you for playing an extra hour in my case.

												NBA2K17 is a horribly unfinished game where you play the warrior every time on play now online, Offline you don't even get to do crap Pros My Gm/League: This is probably the best mode in the game cause of how u don't have to play the games, The realism of the  trading and free angency is still off but the simulation is fine now,  Cons Theres Lots Of ThemGameplay: The gameplay feels clunky and unfinished, there are players going all over the place on defense and offense, The timing the lay-up feels so forced and dumb that it just becomes annoying because of how many people played the other games and are slow learners. The Aiming the shot feels completly pointless with the X or Square button still being used. MyTeam: Myteam this year is stupid because of a bunch of reasons firstly, The player ratings in this mode is just plain stupid, having them so low rated is just absolutly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Secondly, The gameplay in MyTeam is worse online because of how bad some peoples internet is making even worse!! Thirdly, The domination this year is just a waste of time and pointless I just don't know what to say about it Game Breaking Glitches: People with invisible arms, people teleporting, The whole offline play,  Summary This game needed a few more months in develoment and would've been alot better, hopefully before 2K18 they fix these glitches.

												1)If you dont put extra money to buy ingame coins your progression in almost every mod is doomed to a slow death.No time for this.No more money also.2)Gameplay freedom is a joke getting worse every year,free play is an illussion.If you dont run plays,ready sets you suck.Best sport scripting simulation of all time.Thats what it is.Whats the point of human interaction?To pick play A,B or C?Just put AI its better on this.You think you play basketball??think about matrix..and dont you dare to leave your play!you ll be punished. You are trapped not only in a scripted animation fest,but in a follow/pick play or die fest.Shame for what looked great at a first view.			"

												**This review is based solely on my experience from MyCareer**TL;DR: The MyCareer experience is a solid 10/10.When you start your MyCareer for the very first time, you quickly realize, this ""ain't no Spike Lee joint"", but that's probably the best part of the story during your first season of your career. Without spoiling too much I can reveal that you're given two friends in the NBA (Justice and Denver) who will accompany you on your journey. These two are by far the best thing 2K have come up with as they are extremely well thoughtout characters, and the actor behind Justice, Michael B Jordan if I'm not mistaken, known from TV does an extremely good job at portraying your best friend. Put in contrast to 2k16, where Vic was supposed to be your best friend, the characters in 2k17 are actually likeable. Besides that, the story is well ridden and you get more ""off court time"" as you attend practices and endorsements/meetups, the latter being rabbitholes, but for ""roleplaying"" it's still nice. You get to actually play in college this year, although it is only for four or five games. Personally I would've loved to have played more in college, although I know other players hated the college experience. In the future I hope we get a chance to pick our starting conditions. i.e., do we want to play the college experience or 2k15's version where you are undrafted, and that way get a chance to pick who you play for (to some degree)Now to the actual gameplay. The gameplay this year feels much smoother than previous games. Your teammates are actually smart and will make plays and are more likely to shoot if they are open (no more 2k15 hugging of the ball when they are completely open). Defense play seems much smoother and thusly easier and the greatest change is the AI's better understanding of pick'n'roll plays, where you can with fewer button hits and thusly much faster tell them to screen for you and go to the basket for your easy assist. Final Judgement:If you're thinking about getting this game primarily for the MyCareer experience I can only strongly suggest that you do, as I rate this year's MyCareer a solid 10/10. You really feel part of the team, although the people who make you feel this way aren't on the actual team. The friendship you build are well written and the cutscenes make you want more. **A few bugs have happened for me though primarily the ""no cutscenes bug"" where you will go your first 10-13 games without getting cutscenes with Justice. **			"

												It's so hard to find a game online.  If I am Orlando Magic (Tier 4 Team), It appears I can only play against another Tier 4 team, or a Tier 3 team.  Then on top of that, I can only play against someone in the same League as me.  95% of people playing are going to use the Cavs or Golden State, so that pretty much means my favorite team in my favorite game mode is unplayable.  I see why they are doing it like that, but at least make an option where I can waive the Tier Limit and play a game to make the selection of potential games deeper.  No reason I should have to hit search and walk away for an hour or so while waiting for the planets to align. Graphics are great on PC and game runs smooth, but I had to buy it on Xbox One to play online.  Can pretty much only play Franchise and MyCareer mode on here.			"

												Well, gameplay wise this iteration is definitely the smoothest yet. I don't have all that much play time, but i can tell you in the couple hours i've played exhibition games its extremely smooth and a good time. My issue with the game, and the reason why it's getting a negative review are as follows.1. Awful PC support2k just doesn't care about PC nearly as much as consoles, as PC is the black sheep and the consoles are where most of the cash cows are. They have their whales on PC im sure too, but console is where a  ton  of their whales are. Whales are people who buy obscene amounts of VC, which leads into my second and most important point. But first, there just isn't the support console receives on PC. Broken Vsync, a 60hz refresh rate, blatant port of certain menu features that are extremely weird to navigate on PC. 2. VC has become the central focus of 2k, and thats unacceptable.We've gotten to a point in the gaming industry where DLC is extremely prevalant, and generally accepted. This is a mistake in my opinion, but i won't go on a tirade about the industry. 2k pushes microtransactions on you CONSTANTLY. It was bad enough last year, but its only gotten worse. The amount of grinding necessary to get VC incentivizes microtransactions through the irrtation and slow nature of progression. This was clearly intentional. To get into the practice screen, you have to go through at least 4 loading screens, so by the time you get there your ready to rip your hair out because you've done this 20 times. This leads to people spending hundreds of dollars to upgrade their player, which is ridiculous in my opinion. A lot of people use the justification ""well lots of games use grinding, it adds play time."" There is NO way in hell it should take more than 40 hours of playing without microtransactions to max out your player. Everywhere you turn in 2k games there is ads for vc, begging you to buy more. Its not enough that we spend 60 dollars on a video game, no. You also need to have a continuous stream of income dumped into the game to be competitive unless you'd like to spend half the year grinding away in extremely boring modes. Having everything center around VC is a blatant and digusting cash grab that i hope stops, but i know it wont. Ultimately, if your looking for gameplay only, i suppose its an ok investment. Honestly spending 60 dollars just to play a few hours of pickup games makes me feel like an idiot, and unless you REALLY, REALLY love the other modes in NBA, id just steer clear of this. I regret spending what i did on the game. Im sure when the NBA season actually starts my play time will see a jump, and ill enjoy what i play, but god are they money hungry. "

												Finally took the plunge to get this on the last day of pre-release, after being sure that my old comp is able to handle the graphics. Here are my observations based on a couple of Myleague & PlayNow games:Likes:1. System requirement's pretty much similar to that of 2k16's. I'm running it on a bootcamp imac, i5 processor with GT750M.  so far so good, no crashes whatsoever. 2. player movement seems fluid, especially crossovers, hestitation moves etc. broke a couple of ankles using Jamal crawford ;D can't imagine what one can do with Kyrie Irving or Steph Curry3. Chris Paul sinks open jumpshots consistently now, unlike in 2k16 where I can't get him to score open shots to save his life/ team4.  Nice upgrade in terms of sound, love how it improves the atmosphere of matches5. Easier to draw a foul during drives to the basket. might be a bad thing unless you are using the Beard. i like it because this may deter cheap reach-in spammers Dislikes:1) Biggest beef with this game is the clunky OTF menu. 2K really took a step backwards with this one.  Now it's more graphical but less intuitive. how about not changing things for the sake of changing eh 2k? or at least give us a tutorial on the changes so that we don't have to spend so much time trying to figure it out ourselves? 2) The menu at time-outs gives me a headache. I've never needed to spend full 60 secs to get all my coaching instructions right in the previous 2Ks.   Player substitutions during time outs do not take effect until the next dead ball, this has to be a bug?!?! I've to get around this by using OTF substitutions with intentional fouls.3) Graphics issues - clippings, players with invisible arms4) Can't specify strategies before start of games?? 5) Can we customise our line-ups in the coach options BEFORE the games so that we don't have to change it every single game? Overall I'll still give it a thumbs up coz there isn't a better b-ball game out in the market. Hopefully they are able to resolve some of the issues by the first update...  "

												NBA 2k17 is the newest basketball game in the long running series by Visual Concepts.There are several modes and something for mostly everyone who enjoys basketball. Such as MyCareer, an RPG mode where you play as a highly touted and scouted rookie who can barely dribble a basketball, who somehow winds up in the NBA. It's a real feel good story. In MyGM mode you can manage your own team, while other GMs try to screw you over every chance they get. Don't worry, you can take your frustrations out on your loyal fans, and gouge them for everything; ticket prices, parking, even refreshments! A true to life basketball business simulation.Or you can play online against other players in various modes, everyone will have mostly the same experience as the netcode hasn't been touched since the Dreamcast version of the series.Overall, NBA 2K17 is the best basketball game on Earth, mostly by default. Also gamers, don't forget to fuel up with Gatorade™ and MTNDew™, since the game will remind you every chance it gets.			"

												Waste of money, wouldn't suggest buying it full price unless it's on a sale, for example 60% - 80%, only then it would probably be worth it.A game developed by such a big company, 2K, yet they still make a piece of s*it game. Don't know about consoles, but it just absolutely sucks on PC.There is at least 1 second delay when playing with the controller, you simply can't play MyCareer on more than 60hz and with vsync off, otherwise you will miss more than half of the cutscenes as they cut midway if you even get any cutscenes, unlike me, the game is just broken.The shot meter is absolute garbage, you miss almost every single shot unless you release at the very end so you get a perfect release, how does that make any sense at all?MyCareer story might be good if you're interested in that, if you're lucky to get any cutscenes of the storymode, unlike me.Very dissappointed, 2K support is garbage and doesn't help apart from telling you to verify their crap game.

												Everything that 2K16 had was taken to the next level, specially the s**** Spike Lee joint. The gameplay feels way smoother and dependant on player skill instead of being animation based (post moves and crossovers are smooth as ♥♥♥♥ man), the graphics are fine, new animations bring a fresh feel to the game (love the crowd enthusiasm during the game too) and basically everything just clicks together nicely.MyPlayer is way superior than the last year: -Narrative is way better (♥♥♥♥ you Spike Lee)-You can play the whole Rookie Year again-The off-days are better designed, with various activities on your disposal instead of having one activity take a whole day off.-More choices and RPG'ish feelAlso, no crashes or game freezing bugs so far, runs like a charm and the load times are faster too!Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and I will play this game for a long time, probably more than 2K16 since the gameplay is much more enjoyable.

												NBA 2K17 Review :(Based on my experience so far in the game)Pros or the things that i like :- First off this year 2K17 is huge improvement from last year, all what you hear are mostly right, the gameplay are much smoother, the way you handle the ball is really felt amazing,  doing dribble moves crossover here and there breaking ankles. - The layup meter is actually not bad even though you have to get used to it first. - Difficulty Hall of Fame this year finally doesn't feel like in 2K16 where your opponent is unreal, this time it's hard but it's fair, i really enjoyed playing in HoF, great challenge to test your skill. But if it's your first time try from Pro then work your way up. - MyCareer and MyLeague are also huge improvement (these are the main reason i am buying this game)- In MyCareer great story line. Where else did you get a sport game with great story? It's a huge plus, it felt like an RPSG (Role Playing Sport Game). the caps are really strict but personally i like it, but it could be improved. - In MyLeague you can start with additional teams and start from off season so you can fix whatever your favorite team doing wrong this off season(yes i am looking at you lakers)Cons or things i dislike and needed to be fixed immidiately :- Start with gameplay, broken defense. Okay sometimes my guy just leave his assignment even though i don't need help on defense. and that mooving screeen (it's not technically a screen, but it feels like you just being pushed by your opponent) it is totally needed to be fixed. even though sometimes you can use it to your advantage to get open shot, but still it's a broken defense- The cap, yes i like it but it's very strict and could be improved like after practice that cap upgrade not only it upgraded the overal cap of the upgrade we can buy, but also the max level of that upgrade path.Ex : like in the shooting 3pt path i can only upgrade until level 15, after practice and filling those doing work bar and level up, it could be used to increase the max level to level 16 3pt. Overall :Yes I love this game, but i hope patches are coming in the future to fix this. I know 2K worked hard on this to be a perfect basketball game. but until i get these problem fixed i give this game 8/10PS : I am not really interested in myTeam but it's pretty good, collecting cards, doing challenge playing game online, but you need serious vc if you want your team to be good fast, and i am not really a fan of that.

												7/10It would be a 10 out of 10 but the game has some pretty annoying cons that 2K would have to consider fixing!Overall a great game! But.....Pros:- Gameplay is solid. Very good work done here. Everything runs flawlessly in-game. Graphics are pretty good, movement of players and with or without ball seems real, shot animations and animations in general work smoothly and appear real on eye.- Game atmosphere it's fantastic! Fans graphocs and animations are awesome and even a friend of mine when I sent him a video of a buzzer beater I've managed, he didn't realized this was a game but thought this happened IRL.- MyCareer story is good, although replacing two players IRL with two new (Justice Young and Denver Levins) is somewhat not ideal.  It would prefferable for 2K to have given them another role in-game.- MyGM mode has not changed a lot, at least until the part I've managed to reach(still mid-season). Good thing they still let you choose the roster. Cause I did some edits I wanted.Cons:- MyCareer roster! 2K should let you choose an edited roster like on MyGM mode.- !!!!!!  MyCareer system of upgrading your player is pretty much annoying!!!! Forcing you to buy extra VC if you want to quickly update your player. Even participating in all practices all you gain is extra upgrade points and no free attributes gain. If you want to increase your attributes you'll have to pay. I may understand that putting player stats on the server side and forcing you to buy upgrades with VC is to catch cheaters on myPark mode but I think that MyCareer player and MyPark player has to be seperated! Or at least give you a chance to choose so when you start your Career.-1,5 for this  on overall score- MyGM mode had from previous year the ""Relocation"" option. Well this was a good feature that needed improvents and none made. To the point. The game let's you stay on the same city and not even rename the organization. That's pretty awesome!But the game does not let you finish tha application without alternating your court and jerseys. Why? All I want is just to upgrade my arena's features to have a more attendance and game revenue. I don't want to change either my team's jerseys or the court design.  For example I have Bucks! I like their current uniforms and court desings(they have two different). I don't want to change them. But game does not let you complete the relocation application.-1,5 for this too.So overall score is 7/10 for only two cons in the game. But these are so annoying that leave a bitter taste at the end.			"

												After almost 50 hours with NBA 2K17 I can say it is a superior basketball game to it's predecessor - 2K16. You won't see the improvements on video footage since graphics are pretty much the same (except sweat and players body types) but as with the gameplay improvements - they are there.First of all, when you play your first game you realise how much more fluid the controls over players feel. Slower players are finally not totally useless as even they can contribute to the score not only by attempting 3 point shots but also SUCCEFULLY driving to the basket. Yes, attacking the basket off the dribble actually makes sense this year and yet it's not really easier. New thing with this game is that you have to time your every shot - including layups, floaters, post hooks and shots under the basket. It's difficult to get a hang of at first but later you can appreciate this addition as every ""green release"" goes in - yeah, NO MATTER WHAT. Shot meter this year is different too and it seems that timing the shot perfectly is a lot harder. As I mentioned before - controls are fluid, there is almost no imput lag (in offline games) and you can go from one crossover move to the other without your player bumping into the defender and being stuck in the animation afterwards. Crossing people and getting by them is a lot of fun and isolation plays make sense.What do I hate? Getting stuck on the moving screen and ending up 10 feet from the opposite team's player which happens constantly and some funky elements of MyCareer mode within its plot. It's far better than last year (10-minutes cutscenes are gone, HELL YEAH) with pretty interesting role of Michael B. Jordan playing Justice Young - an NBA prospect coming to the league undrafted which becomes your teammate and your best friend as well. The chemistry between your MyPlayer and Justice is pretty believable and not-so-in-your-face as with Vic in NBA 2K16. Playing a game with him on the floor is a lot of fun, too.There is a subject of face-scan for MyPlayer as well. I'm absolutely happy that it has finally arived on PC version but there aren't any more positives that come to my mind. It's a horrible process, horrible companion app for Android/iOS, just horrible overall. If you are not keen on that function coming into the game - don't even try it, because you will find yourself wasting HOURS on trying to get any decent scan that doesn't make your nose appear on your chin. You'll probably check it anyway so I won't bother spending any more time on it - it seems that creators were thinking the same. yuck.So overall, if you are a fan of both NBA and NBA 2k games there is no reason not to buy this year rendition of this franchise. There are a lot of neccesary improvements from previous game which makes me almost sure that I'll beat my time from NBA 2k16 at 508 hours in-game. Think no longer - get it!			"

 This game should have been released in Steam Early Access for half price since it clearly doesn't play like a finished game. Too many CRASHES & BUGS to count! Crashes frequently on PC just like in 2K16 & 2K15! These games never crash in-game but just randomly in the menus of the various game modes. Every year I repeat the same stupid mistake of buying the new 2K basketball game thinking they will fix the crashing issues, THEY DON'T! I have a laptop and an extremely high-end PC I play on, as well as my brother who plays on a third computer. Every year all three of our computers randomly crash while  trying  to play this game. Therefore this is completely an issue of the game and not the computers! On top of all that this game runs like complete garbage on my PC running SLI 980 TI's. It runs even worse than last years game. The hair on players is transparent and there are many more bugs & glitches in-game. If 2K seriously cared about releasing a quality game, they would not only have fixed the problems that have plagued this franchise in years past, but would have correctly patched the previous games as well (as none of their patches fixed any of the crashing and still left many bugs). If I play MyLeague for an hour or two, I experience crashes to the desktop 2 or 3 times  minimum. It's as if these developers and testers didn't play the game at all before they released it.2K please offer me a job, my input alone is worth more than you pay these idiots to make this game. ATTN ALL PC GAME PUBLISHERS: When you resort to only releasing console games, don't blame the lack of PC sales on pirates when your abysmal games are not worth paying for!			"

												Alot of the same issues with NBA 2K16 my player are present in NBA 2K17. You cannot skip cut scenes in my player even on your 2nd or 3rd player. The game will randomly crash from time to time. The skill caps on your player doesn't allow you to create a 95+ player, instead you are forced to build a more realistic player. I feel this takes away some of the appeal and immersion.			"

												So this is a pre-release review with every intention of a follow up. For the most part it is a negative review.Cons:1) PC Disadvantage:-Pre-Release content. I heard that consoles were able to get the game a week in advance with just high school content. This enabled players to build the character up prior to the actual game. Unfortunately PC players didn’t get that option. Also Iv read that some people haven’t gotten any bonuses.-Graphics. Because the PC version is a port from the consoles, there is a big difference in performance. When playing on consoles, graphics are set; however when starting the graphics need to be tweaked. For those sporting a 1070+ graphics cards Iv read that they have been doing fine. I read a review where a person with a 970 sli was struggling. For majority of the people it is going to be like this: lower your graphics to get a faster gameplay, or increase your graphics to what you feel was acceptable by nba2k16 and experience a very laggy gameplay. I’m running a gtx970m, had no problems with the previous games on max settings but am struggling here. The voice acting in the cutscenes finish way ahead than the actual laggy video.2) Initial Story:-How can the personality of the character be so arrogant and pompous with the level designated to him. Jeez even number 1 draft picks in the game are given like a 78 or 79. Also why can’t we skip initial cutscenes?Pros:1) More options?-A lot more options are provided but I haven’t experienced them all. For instance, you can add 6 new teams into your mygm mode. Will add more with a follow up.Neutral1) Face Scan-Mix reviews about this. One would think that capturing a face scan on a cellphone would make things easier (because of the higher megapixels etc) but it is still challenging. Some people are able to get it with little effort while others struggle. Hence this feature is pretty neutral.Will be waiting for an update/patch for the game to answer the graphical issues. It sucks because pre-ordering it gives people the opportunity to play the game 4 days in advance. This graphical issue negates that advantage because playing on lowered settings spoils the experience for the user, while they have to wait for a patch. Right of the the Bat: console versions definitely better option. For the recommendation portion: If people pre-ordered this and got a discount on the price, then thats your advantage. However, if people paid full price with the option of playing earlier, then I don't recommend it. If you are like the majority where NBA 2k16 was running smoothly, there is a high chance it won't for the inital part of the game till after an update is released (which may come in a week or 2). "

												I would wait for atleast a couple patches. While the game plays fine and has added a lot of awesome features, the gameplay and some game mechanics are anything but NBA Basketball.For starters help defense is broken on any difficulty. Your team deffense is down right laughable at times. And whatever happened to ""Simulation"" mode in the settings? Three pointers are another issue. No one ever hardly misses. No matter the Match up both teams usually record 12+ 3's a game with 12 min quarters. All I want is SIMULATION basketball 2k. Quit with all the cheese and unrealistic BS like GS Warriors recording 83 points in the first half in My Career with 12 min quarters. This game is absolutely unrealistic in terms of gameplay at this point.			"

												Due to having played NBA 2k for a decade, I have high expectations for these games.  The graphics are good, the offline play is good.   They made a change to allow you to sim to your teams draft spot instead of having to wait for every other team to pick their player in the draft.  That's where the good ends for me.  I tried playing myplayer but they have made these terrible cut scenes that you CANNOT skip until your completed one iteration of myplayer.  I tried and couldn't take it - it is too frustrating to be forced to watch cutscenes for a product that I've paid for, I shut it off after moving to my college team - I won't start it unless they patch in the ability to skip the cutscenes.The thing I live for in NBA 2k is playing against other people online, full court, NBA teams, I'm not interested in that mycourt stuff.  Playing online is terrible - the input lag is awful.  The players move around like they are skating on ice.  7 footers repeatedly miss uncontested 2 foot shots.  Instead of 7 footers simply laying the ball in or dunking they take fade away jumpers from 3 feet.  There are these repeated stupid canned animations for the ball rolling around the rim or bouncing up over the backboard to go out of bounds - it can happen upwards of 10-20 times in a 20 minute game.  They have made the defensive adjustments menu confusing.  Charges and over the back calls happen way too often.  I can't tell you how many times I will grab a defensive rebound and due to the input lag my player will then whip a full court shot.  Or try to make a fast break pass to an open teammate and the ball sails over my teammates head out of bounds - this happens 9/10 times on a fast break pass that is more than 20 feet.   The shot meter is awful.  There is in general difficulty even finding a match - they now have a timer showing the 'average wait time' for an opponent in online play but that is terrible information(and doesn't accurately reflect how long you will wait for a match) - give us a server browser, let us see players close to us, their ping, let us choose who we play against.  I'm upset there is no way to request a rematch after playing someone online.  There is no way to send a friend request after playing someone online.  There is no easy way to challenge someone ranked on the 2k leaderboards. You still can get to tip off only to discover you have both chosen the same jersey color, and if you've chosen the same team your game is going to be a pain in the rear.  As I said, I have high expectations but I don't think these are unreasonable things to expect from a basketball game in the year 2017.			"

												The reason for not recommeding this game is I am unable to play a game other than pick up games on MyCourt with friends. Trying to play a Head - to - Head, Team-Up, or MyTeam games is impossible due to non-connections to 2kServers. As soon as we enter the match, we are immediately kicked out with the prompt of, ""You have encountered a problem connecting with the game. Your session will be ended."" every time. Without fail, every damn time. Being that I've owned the game since release, and being that there has been 4 patches since release, I would have expected to play with friends by now. But nope, no ""luck"" (As if luck needs to be part of their product). Regardless, if you're looking to play offline and single player, MyPlayer mode is about a 6.5/10 this year. RPG system they implemented seems tedious and inflated. Ratings will show a lot higher than the actual rating of your character. (i.e. a ""90"" rated player is somewhere in the high 70's or low 80's) Storyline is boring, and ""immersion"" into everyday scheduling is boring as hell. Would not waste $60 on this (imo single player game).Thanks, 2k. I have been a loyal customer since 2k7. Every year I'm disappointed, but you're my only option as a basketball fan. Guess I'll just have to drive my ♥♥♥ to my friend's house to go play your product. Being that it's 2016, you'd think we'd be able to play online consistently by now.			"

												Before I start, this game is like is like meeting a hot chick at the bar, you buy her drinks, but you still get no play.MyTeam:PackOdds are horrible. ♥♥♥♥ this odds. Why make bundles worth coins (stuff you have to pay for) if you're going to get trash. Played a guy who was shooting from almost half court with players out side of Steph (♥♥♥♥ing Richard Hamilton hit half court shots). Kind of ♥♥♥♥ is that. I played against someone who reached all game and got a steal each time. I only got 3 reach-in fouls from him. I reach one time and I get a foul. Reach, Teach, Shut that ♥♥♥♥ up. MyCareer: Pretty much an RPG. I got NPC's with gold badges in every department, but I'm stuck with 5 and Pro Badge. ""Oh you get a grand badge"" man shut that ♥♥♥♥ up. The grind is not worth the badges.  If you're looking for a grind, I promise you this is more grinding than Tony Hawk and the Clipse combined.My Park: Stretch Big's run the park. I pretty much have to accept defeat once they arrive. Pretty much i give up on this game. I'm not buy NBA2K anymore. ♥♥♥♥ is horrible. I've been playing since 2K9 and it's gotten worse since 2K11.

												Best NBA simulation game ever. However, it is still a video game and has a ton of faults. Some that lead to extreme frustration. Some examples:-difficulty settings are not gradual. Playing on Pro is too easy and All-Star too difficult against AI. Your players miss open shots while the AI ""NEVER"" miss open shots (until rubber-banding kicks in towards the end of games). You can adjust the gameplay sliders for myGM mode, but not for myTeam.- players are lethargic recovering back to transition, and even after scoring a basket. I can't count how many times AI point guard made a half court pass to a wide open center under the basket for a dunk immediately after I scored. Even user controlled players are super slow to defent.- user controlled teammates are almost useless on defense. Jimmy Butler will lose his man ALL THE TIME playing on All-Star difficulty. C'mon man- offensive fouls are the dumbest in 2k17 since I can remember. They're called way too often, unless I'm trying to take a charge -- in that case the AI will just bump me and go right past the defender.- shot meter is different for all players and even different for the same player based on the shot, making it very difficult to time well. To make things worse, even if you match the meter almost perfectly but happen to go over, missed shot (even wide open) is almost guaranteed.- one of the most frustrating items in all of the 2k games is 6'1"" point guards significally affecting layups of much taller offensive players. Countless missed layups. It includes dunks too. People with high dunk ratings will miss dunks when there's a defender nearby, no matter the size.- AI seem to be much better at FT% than their ratings (or real life stats) suggest- AI players shooting pull up 3s instead of easy layups on fast breaks (and always making them). EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!!- Dwight Howard hitting fadeaway jumpshots- Shooting guards will leave their assigments to cover Deandre Jordan at the 3 point line- goaltending called on dunks- one of my playoff runs had 0% attendance the whole time sans one game- crossovers consistently resulting in steals, no matter the dribbling skills of the ball handler- simulating games will consistently result in ridiculous results, to include 20% FG percentagesThis is not an all-inlcusive list of horse-dung in this game that will make you light your face on fire.All that said, an excellent game, a must have for any NBA fan.

												In short, NBA2k17 is excellent from a gameplay standpoint. Pick a team and play with your friends and it's incredibly fun, as are most of the 2k games. Play on your own against the AI and it's incredibly fun. Play MyCareer and it's again just fun.But there are a few issues. I mostly play MyCareer and MyLeague. There aren't really any specific issues to MyLeague that aren't also in MyCareer, so I'll only talk about the latter.The biggest issue are the archetypes. I have no issue being limited in creating my player, after all it should still be realistic. That said what 2k did here isn't limiting, it's crippling. While the playing itself is fun, you won't create a superstar, like you did earlier in the series. You might be one, depending on how good you are at the game, but you could just choose a random role player and play just as good. If you only play myCareer it might not be apparent, but I have a higher rating than Patrick McCaw for example, but McCaw is clearly the better player, and it's not even close. I read that 2K is apparently tricking with their ratings in MyCareer, which to me seems to be the case.I understand that they want to make their competitive scene more interesting, but I think this is the wrong way.Another big problem is time. While it seems like they actually were able to cut loading times of games, the games feel a lot slower. What once was skippable pretty much immediately (timeouts and such) now takes forever. And while I appreciate the new style of the interviews, after the 10th time I just want to pick my answer and move on. Why do I have to watch myself walk out of the arena after every single game? Why do I have to watch myself walk at all outside of a game situation. I actually like the time managment and practice and all that, but just load. I don't want to wait ten seconds to walk out of my gym just so the game can THEN start to load.I probably forgot some things already. I can only stress that despite all of this the game is really fun. But if 2K were to improve some of these issues the game could be amazing. Right now it isn't, and that's so disappointing. At least it looks like 2K got back on track again after the abysmall 2k16.			"

												Gameplay quite well, some bugs like disappeared arms and legs (quick game and myteam). Collision query is dubious. Small 1,85 m-PG pushes a 2,10m-C through the paint. Not in the post, but when they collide during a play (e.g. P&R). The biggest mistake is the in-game curreny. VC is absolutly rare, but you need so much of it, if you want to upgrade your bad 55 overall player, buy cards for myteam etc. In NBA2K15 the cheapest myteam pack was 1.250 VC, now 5000 VC!!!Spiele das Spiel auf einem i3-2120 und einer GTX 750 in mittleren bis niedrigen Einstellungen mit 60 fps.

												Look I've played 2k since AI ruled the cover. The gameplay is fantastic.  Everything about the game is on point. The bad: if you play career or online they make you grind hard for VC and lvls in a mycareer mode that won't let you skip cutscenes. and everything cost so much that if you don't spend real money on VC you're stuck playing with a very average toon against lvl 90+ toons in my park. And if they're on your team you're not getting the ball which can make playing my park or pro am very frustrating. Awesome Bball sim with money hungry online options that take tons of VC (virtual currency). Overall: 9/10Online: 7/10 cost money to have a good myplayer unless you grind like crazy.			"

												The reason for not recommeding this game is I am unable to play a game other than pick up games on MyCourt with friends. Trying to play a Head - to - Head, Team-Up, or MyTeam games is impossible due to non-connections to 2kServers. As soon as we enter the match, we are immediately kicked out with the prompt of, ""You have encountered a problem connecting with the game. Your session will be ended."" every time. Without fail, every damn time. Being that I've owned the game since release, and being that there has been 4 patches since release, I would have expected to play with friends by now. But nope, no ""luck"" (As if luck needs to be part of their product). Regardless, if you're looking to play offline and single player, MyPlayer mode is about a 6.5/10 this year. RPG system they implemented seems tedious and inflated. Ratings will show a lot higher than the actual rating of your character. (i.e. a ""90"" rated player is somewhere in the high 70's or low 80's) Storyline is boring, and ""immersion"" into everyday scheduling is boring as hell. Would not waste $60 on this (imo single player game).Thanks, 2k. I have been a loyal customer since 2k7. Every year I'm disappointed, but you're my only option as a basketball fan. Guess I'll just have to drive my ♥♥♥ to my friend's house to go play your product. Being that it's 2016, you'd think we'd be able to play online consistently by now.			"

You finish a Game with a A+ rating and awesome stats and suddenly it crashes and the game doesnt count. I even had to play 1 game three times because it always crashed at the end of that game.I wont even start to tell you about the CPU or the moving screens. The CPU defence is just plain stupid and the moving screens happen so often that it kills all the fun.But if you are able to play a game without any bugs its realy fun, Dribbling is great, playing D is great the new shot system is great but the bugs arround that are just killing the game.I hope ill get a refund, i tried hard to like this game but it is just unplayable			"

 Reply to downvoted reviews.  Honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about, the game ran great on 2k16 and now it runs even better on 2k17. I am running the game on the highest settings and getting 60fps with a gtx 760 t,i i7 870 cpu, some cheap ten year old motherboard and 8gb of ram. The game has never crashed, froze, or lagged. The game is everything you want. It's extremely well optimized in my opinion and the gameplay and features are really excellent.  Gameplay and features  Honeslty I'm a big my league fan and they have added so much this year. Now you can expand your league up to 36 teams (you can make or own or choose one of the 2k created ones which are very well made). Also you can vote on league changes, when it comes to removing the shotclock, ovetime sudden death changes, and many many more. Now my career is incredible because you have many cutsenes and every person has a unique storyline for their player. You can text people to come to your house to 1v1 or practice. Texting has different responses for every text you recieve.  The shot meter is a full bar for a green release which in my opinion I love. The game is more realistic than ever. You actually feel you are in an NBA game. They are 500 new animated. What I like about it is that the cpu now actually act like real players, they won't pass to you to the ball 24/7 anymore. When you create your plyer you choose a position and then a playstyle, whether its shotcreator, sharpshooter, or many more. There are actually 7 to choose from. Different stats go up and down as you adjust your height, weight, and wingspan. End   Now clearly I didn't say all the things about the game as it is a quick review. Park is the same but I still love it. I don't play my team but I know they added a TON to it. Well I hope this review was helpful and made you buy the game. "

												A massive step backward from 2k16 which was already a shaky game. Do Not play against the A.I. though, stick to pvp as it is much more balanced. The game is designed to be challenging but it reaches a certain point (especially in MyCareer) when the game has to make you worse in order to keep up. Which is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There were countless times where players I was defending literally glitched through me and made shots. I created a guy that had his shooting stats maxed out, I spent hours perfecting the timing on his shot. Yet, even if I played a game where all I took was wide-open shots, I would probably end up shooting 30-40% which is nonsense. The only time I felt my player shot a decent percentage we end up blowing out teams by 60 pts. so I turn the difficulty up hoping to balance it out. Wrong. My teammates who all have significantly lower shooting attributes shoot around 50-60% (with heavily contested shots) yet I can't make more than 2-3 shots in a row even if all of them were wide open. The hit detection is absolute garbage. I've had some of my shots blocked only to look at the replay and see the guy who blocked me not even touch the ball. I watch as the ball just kinda glitchs through my hand as though the game was like: ""Oh, hey you're about to make an easy layup? LOL I don't think so idiot!"" Trying to get good at this game while playing the A.I. is like trying to make free-throws in real life while an evil leprachaun makes fun of you and punches you in the ♥♥♥♥ everytime you're about to make one. It's beyond infuriating. Either the A.I. is really easy to handle or it just makes you look like you should've never played video games in the first place. There is no challenging in between where it's not infuriating but I still have to work for it. The worst part about the difficulty scaling is that once you reach a certain rating with your player you feel the need to bump up the difficulty a little, otherwise it gets too easy and the game isn't fun. So as your player gets better attribute ratings you bump the difficulty up a little so that you can still play well but also have to keep working for it. However, it reaches a point where it gets so difficult that you may as well just sit back and simulate the games (unless your some kind of nba 2k17 god) it reaches a point where the game is working so hard to beat you that it is nearly impossible to play well, regardless of your rating. I may end up with 26 pts. when it's all said and done, which is good, but I'll probably end up shooting 20% just to get there. Shot timing is very finnicky, especailly on harder difficulties. Sometimes the shot meter even starts before you've caught the ball and you're stuck with a late release. Wouldn't it make more sense for the shot meter to start when, oh I don't know, you start shooting the actual ball!!!! I can't remember the number of times I wanted to shoot immediately off a pass  by holding down shoot only to see the shot meter is already past the threshold for a make before I even release the ball. It's completely counter-intuitive and frustrating. The best option is to wait until you've caught the ball and wait for a moment so that the pass catch animation can finish before you shoot. The only problem is it takes waaaaaay too long, so by the time you can actually make a shot, you sort of can't because the A.I. moves nearly perfect on defense (especially beyond pro difficulty). So, by the time you've gotten open, caught the ball, and are now ready to shoot, you have a defender in your face who will make you miss the shot anyway. Yet you can also watch your teammates make the same shots with no problem at all, as the A.I. gets a near perfect release just about every shot. These seem like such minor problems that should have been fixed through beta testing, but, I would be surprised if they beta tested it at all. For now, I don't recommend this game until they figure out a way to fix all the shoddy mechanics. Stay away from MyCareer, as fun as it is in the beginning it quickly becomes infuriating. Play with teams in online pvp or manage a team in MyGM/Franchise and leave it at that. It's pretty much all the game is good for at the moment.			"

 Reply to downvoted reviews.  Honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about, the game ran great on 2k16 and now it runs even better on 2k17. I am running the game on the highest settings and getting 60fps with a gtx 760 t,i i7 870 cpu, some cheap ten year old motherboard and 8gb of ram. The game has never crashed, froze, or lagged. The game is everything you want. It's extremely well optimized in my opinion and the gameplay and features are really excellent.  Gameplay and features  Honeslty I'm a big my league fan and they have added so much this year. Now you can expand your league up to 36 teams (you can make or own or choose one of the 2k created ones which are very well made). Also you can vote on league changes, when it comes to removing the shotclock, ovetime sudden death changes, and many many more. Now my career is incredible because you have many cutsenes and every person has a unique storyline for their player. You can text people to come to your house to 1v1 or practice. Texting has different responses for every text you recieve.  The shot meter is a full bar for a green release which in my opinion I love. The game is more realistic than ever. You actually feel you are in an NBA game. They are 500 new animated. What I like about it is that the cpu now actually act like real players, they won't pass to you to the ball 24/7 anymore. When you create your plyer you choose a position and then a playstyle, whether its shotcreator, sharpshooter, or many more. There are actually 7 to choose from. Different stats go up and down as you adjust your height, weight, and wingspan. End   Now clearly I didn't say all the things about the game as it is a quick review. Park is the same but I still love it. I don't play my team but I know they added a TON to it. Well I hope this review was helpful and made you buy the game. "

Warning for those who want to buy this, not because of the for-mentioned reasons but because the shot meter is so bad that you shoot and get 1 milimeter gap to filling the bar and... it's a miss, but when you mistakenly release the button far from filling the shot meter it goes in, to summarize it's bad.

												DO NOT BUYGame mechanics completely rigged. No matter what you do some games you will not be able to win until playing them 3-4 times. Myteam is a gimmick to get you to spend money otherwise you have to spend hours playing the same team until you beat them with each game being as inconsistent as the last. You can tell the computer changed the game mechanics to either not let you score or to let the other team score. Their players will be able to destroy your defense and then their defense will be inpenetrable. I've even seen the game make me take steps I did not take to keep me in a defensive lock down OR TO EVEN MAKE ME GO OUT OF BOUNDS!!!! If you are buying this game to play with your friends it is a great buy. Anything single player like MyTeam is rigged beyond beleif making you wanna rip your hair out!TLDR; Solo play is rigged, multiplayer only feasable option.			"

												First i need to tell you that i LOVE or loved all NBA2k games till now.The Gameplay is awesome its a huge upgrade to 2k16 but this game has so many bugs that it just makes 0 fun to play.You cant sometimes open your Phone in MyCarrer, you train and suddenly your player is gone, you spend time training (if it is working) to get some plus attribute and they dont even count. You finish a Game with a A+ rating and awesome stats and suddenly it crashes and the game doesnt count. I even had to play 1 game three times because it always crashed at the end of that game.I wont even start to tell you about the CPU or the moving screens. The CPU defence is just plain stupid and the moving screens happen so often that it kills all the fun.But if you are able to play a game without any bugs its realy fun, Dribbling is great, playing D is great the new shot system is great but the bugs arround that are just killing the game.I hope ill get a refund, i tried hard to like this game but it is just unplayable			"

												SO, this isn't really a review per se, but I do want to note that there is some performance issues (noticebly in MyCareer) that does need to be addressed hopefully in a later patch. I recommened that you play on all low settings with special effects turned off, and buffer count set to 1. I would even bring down the resolution to about 1440x900 [16:10], Anti aliasing set to 1, reflections turned off, and Max Anisotropy set to 1 for better performance. Playing on these settings is giving me a more smoother experience with the game. Again guys, hopefully this issue is only temporary, and they'll release a patch for PC here in the next few weeks for better performance. I'm using a NVIDIA GTX 970M grapahics card if you were wondering.			"

												Every year they make changes to the game that make it worse in some way as they are mainly focused on increasing microtransactions.  They still can't figure out how to make the game half-way realistic, and instead simply adjust how much the computer can cheat physics.  The main reason I don't recommend this game is because you are at the whim of the computer almost the entire time you are playing.  Loose balls will bounce through 3 of your players but you won't be able to get to it because a portion of someone's foot is blocking you as you run in place.  A computer player will walk into your area and you get pushed back across the court like you're on an ice floor while your teammates watch. Myteam is a waste of time and simply there try and get you to spend money.  MyCareer is also pretty dumb.  It's cool to be able to build your own character into a star, but you have to sit through endless messages in a broken phone interphase, and cutscenes that add nothing but are forced to sit through.  MyLeague is not nearly as customizable as you would expect and ends up being pretty boring. If the basketball aspect of the game was better, the rest of the gimmicks wouldn't be as empty, but in the end the entire game seems cheap because of how sloppy playing an actual game feels.   It's not a very fun game and I definitely regret spending $60.			"

												Getting the badge in myCareer significanatly ruins my gaming experienceComing back from 500+ hours of gameplay.Still voting down this.At superstar/HOF difficulty, your teamates now make lots of mistakes and have a very low FG percentage while the opposite team is significantly buffed. Think of it like this: In these two difficulties if you cannot carry your whole team then don't try them. One thing I cannot tolerate: on these two difficulties the opposite team can make 3 pointers at nearly 100% percent with your teamate putting a hand on their faces.It is no longer about how much skill you have on defense.

												NBA 2K17 is a game that doesn't stray too far from the formula.  This isn't a bad thing of course, why fix what isn't broken?  The most significant changes come in the career mode, which, while fun to play can seem a little heavy on the 'grindy' side.  There are some occassional issues with animations stealing control from you, or getting muscled around by heavier, stronger characters, and even moments when my controller inputs stopped working momentarily, but it never stopped me from enjoying the core gameplay loop.Not much is new here in terms of gameplay, but the window dressing around it seems a lot nicer and more streamlined.  This is another solid entry in the 2K series, and definitely worth your time if you're a fan of videogame basketball.  Not like you have many alternatives anyway. "

Fix the sliders or allow us to change them ourselves, no need for 2 sets, one for both cpu and player no advantages. Just have better play calling and game management for higher difficulties and get rid of all this set story crap. Have it where based on my play I get reasonable minutes and play calls or even cut, but let us determine our fates. We want realism not nba jam, we shouldnt have to spend hours trying to balance your game. Do better next time 2K or nba live might actually make a good game and take all your customers, then again probably not. Until then I'll be playing 15 where I actually have found decent sliders			"

												I've been playing NBA2K Since 2k9. Xbox, Playstation, PC, you name it I've played it. I am a MASSIVE basketball fan.Somehow they manage to make the UI and controls even less intuitive every single year. It's really depressing considering neither Madden or UFC bring their games to PC. Just a terribly designed game.Every year they change the controls inexplicably, and the in-game controls and menus are unbearable.Want to replace a player in your MyTeam? You can't just switch them. Make sure you scroll all the way over to your starter, select replace from bench, seperate for collection, and then scroll all the way back.Want to make a substituion in-game? Good ♥♥♥♥ing luck with the horrendous UI on court. You'll have to open the menu and make the sub.Oh! But now you're ♥♥♥♥ing PF is inexplicably guarding their PG! So go to defensive subs and change those too. BUT WAIT.  You can't ♥♥♥♥ing access defensive settings until the substitution is complete! But regardless of this, you have to ♥♥♥♥ing press A to go through each ♥♥♥♥ing indvidual in your active roster to find the player you want to guard him. NOT EVEN THE PLAYERS ON THE FLOOR, THE ONES FROM THE BENCH. And then you get to watch endless minutes of digital dancers and coach speak pressing A frantically hoping to just play the game.Don't even get me started on the MyPlayer, even worse than last year. Want to be an average kid from an average family who gets good at basketball? Too bad! You don't even get your own nickname anymore. You get endless cutscenes of you as some douchbag with a dead father and a black kids voice who rose from the bottom to be named 'Prez'. I can't have the voice of an Asian, Mexican, or White kid? I can't be from the suburbs like Bill Lambeer? Oh, and the first coin pack you buy doesn't even get you enough to buy a single card back in MyTeam.I hope this franchise dies off. Pathetic.Edit: The Warrios blew a 3-1 lead and then lost on Xmas day :))))			"

												The game is a fair 5 (for the terrible and questionable VC sytem ""optional buying).And because there are still a lot of problems gathered from previous versions...And a fair 0 (yes, zero!) for 2K, because they decided to sue an independent game developer for Trademark infringement: from now to... none will be able to use the term ""civilization"" for a game if not 2K...So, no good, in any ways...

												Every Year, every year the same old bs..Mainly playing MyCareer and it still feels like they don't care or play their own Game at all.  NOt going to argue about the Story since its better than last Year Mr. Lee bs.2k thinks every Player plays an PG/SG/SF, because they haven't change the Practice for Positions like Center/PF. Its getting so annoying when you have to shoot 3 Pointers as Athletic Dunkmonster in Practice and obviously don't succeed.Then there are the Magic Combos your Mates on that Position can do, like behind the back in 360 Spin Moves and you can't even hit from 3 feet against an PG in Practice.So the Practice is frustrating as Center/PF, except when you choose to be an Big Stretch guy who can shoot 3s..In your NBA Career it won't get better, because the AI is just plain stupid and 2k loves to Script stuff. I well play on HoF.So you are a Center/PF but your Mates are keep Passing you the Ball every 2nd Attack in hope you do the PG or something.They will ignonre you when you are alone under the Basket just to keep Passing you the Ball when you left the Paint in Order to aviod the 3 Second Call, which will happen alot since 2k loves Animations inw hich you will get Stuck.So you supposed to be the Almighty College/High School Guy but you can't hit anything in the NBA even with Good Timing and being so Close to the Basket you can count the Dust particles on it.The Team AI is not there, they leave Guys open in Transition Defense while it would be an 3 vs 1 for our guys, but why would you protect the Rim?You Coach (Teammate Grade) is still crap, you still have to make all things yourself. So prepare to Cover 3 Guys, get Minus when a Block get grabbed 100m away from ya etc.The Movement is sloppy and it feels like i playing a guy who isn't sober for ages.MyTeam isn't working for me since Days, no replies so far on Twitter.Not to Mention the VC/MT Grind if you don't want to pay 90€ every 2 WeeksSome Pro Stuff:VisualsatmosphereContent2kTVCommentary "

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR PC! until they fix the bugginess and lagging issues do not buy this game or buy on console. I've owned NBA 2K17 on XB1 and now PC. This is the worst game i've ever played on PC. I bought a Computer perfectly designed for gaming ( I don't have any problems on any other games, even ones that require more) but NBA2k17 is complete garbage on PC. Lag during shots, defensive moments, turnovers, and any important game moments. The cutscenes are garbage on the PC version and simply don't work. Shame on 2K for selling such a broken product.			"

												I only play MyCareer and/or League/Dynasty mode so this review got nothing to do with MyPark and all other modes that involve playing against other people. Nothing wrong with those modes but I don't have time for those kind of games.Anyway, I definitely recommend this game. Much better MyCareer storyline than the previous one and it doesn't force you to go through the ♥♥♥♥ that Spike Lee forcefully imposed in 2k16 before you can truly play or experience MyCareer. I think it's easier now to level your player up and you get to have your own ""Pippen"" (Justice Young).			"

												Even after just a few hours, I am truly impressed with the latest from the 2k devs. They added and refined so much in this franchise from last year that it is truly amazing. I have been playing the series for a few years now and unlike EA's small incremental improvements, I have to say 2k is determined to impress every year. Even without competition from EA they go above in beyond in presentation and polish this year and in years past. Unlike EA, 2k knows how to put out a quality product consistently.Very impressed, and it is running beautifully on my high-end pc. The best sports sim going...period!Those that are on the fence on getting this year's version should get it. I just finished going through the league expansion mode and wow is it detailed and engrossing. Really great stuff.			"

												The game is beautiful and feels more fluid to me than 2k16.  2k has added more player animations as well.  The game has run flawlessly for me (I7 6600k, 980ti SLI) at over a 100fps with all settings set to the max as I ignored the guidance the game runs best at 60fps.  If you're a fan of basketball, especially the NBA, I highly recommend this game.  In my opinion, MyCareer is one of the best game modes for sports games today, hands down.  MyGM mode is great as well that I feel is chock full of features/options.  While others may be having issues with their controller, I haven't experienced this issue using an Xbox One controller and a Razer Wildcat.  I haven't played any online games at this point as I am entrenched in the MyPlayer mode.I will say, if you haven't played a 2k basketball game, the controls do have a learning curve, but once you get them down the game is absolutely amazing and virtually limitless on what you can do with a player.  2k has also added more options as it relates to the controls that add to the realism of the game.Overall, I highly recommend this game!

												Tried to play MyGM twice. First time I saved was in the middle of the season. Saved a few times after that, and quit. Loaded back up the next day, and I'm back at the first save instead. Yay. Try playing again, make it to midseason of the second season, quit. Back at original save from 1st season. Yay. Start an entirely new game, and make it to season 2. Quit and save. Reload next day and I'm back in season 1. Yay.Start MyCareer. It's ok. Too much practice, and really annoying cutscenes that you have to sit through. Have to watch coaces at timeouts, have to watch your team mope after loses or be happ after wins after ever game (nice but super repetitive when it's the same scene after EVERY game). Have to listen to boring phone calls with you mom. Just a really boring mode all around.No thanks. No more 2k for me.			"

												Pretty much rage deleted this pile of krap and for good reason. I am just sorry I wasted 60 dollars on it I really advise anyone looking at this game to at the very least WAIT till its cheaper. To start player control is atrocious. You can't cut to the basket, because you drift around. You can't pass on the dime because the AI for passing passes to the other team more than your own guys. It literally targets people across the court and into traffic when you want to toss it to the guy 5 feet from you. Sliders to fix this do nothing, I moved ""openess"" to damn near max to try and avoid the AI passing just throwing the ball to the other team....nothing fixes it,Of course the computer controlled teams suffer from none of this. And they cheat incessantly, and it gets annoying fast. But lets get down to why I rage deleted this game....this is the best part. I created my league, spent hours creating a pair of players, arranged rosters, meticulously setup their playtime rotations, I engaged in trades, scoured free agents to build the perfect team for the playoffs. Then...I played a FULL flippin season, like what a 100 games or something? I started simulating against easy teams and played contenders to keep myself the top team. So after all the hard work, I am trying to do the same in the playoffs. I play a few games get ahead of the team I am playing off against, and decide to go ahead and sim some of them. Fine I win the first matchup, so I decide to sim the second series and just play when and if it was close......well...with one button press I accidently simmed the entire thing.In like 2 seconds all that hardwork went down the drain, my team simmed to the finals and lost, despite my team being the strongest by far mind you. Never mind that I actually wanted to play the last series. But no it simmed to the end, and it autosaved the results, a quick ALT F4 did nothing. Literally DISGUSTED, you can't undo it...right because that would be ""cheating""....so they effed my whole season up...with some clunky ridiculous interface with no way to undo it or redo it. This game is a pointless pile of steaming krap. You'd do well to stay as FAR away from it as you can.Honestly the last game I buy from them EVER!!!And to clarify I was not even selecting the last game, I selected the second series, yet some how in its inconsistent BS interface had an option to just skip the playoffs from any box on the playoff diagram....not on the last one mind you where it might logically be!! No 2nd tier playoffs top option on the menu is to sim the ENTIRE thing with no way to stop it.EFF you NBA2K17!!			"

												Don't even know why you'd need to read a review to buy this game, 2K is the only option really. NBA Live isn't even trying this year which they need to do cos 2K is getting lazy. Can't go 5 games without either a crash, some kinda lighting error or other bug, my friends on the ps4 don't have this issue either. Facial animations for Mycareer twitch and bug out during cut scenes too. Overall the game is a improvement from last year in most areas but the grind for VC is real. 2K is getting so ♥♥♥♥ing greedy with the microtransactions man, its ridiculous, like worse than last year. Also the skill caps for Mycareer are ♥♥♥♥ing bs cos they don't want players on mypark running around with 7footers jumping and running all over the place. They need to remove those skill caps for offline mycareer players. Right now your player is limited to a very restricted play style like stretch 4 or athletic. Which is unrealstic compared to real players. If you wanna make a all around great player like LeBron, bad luck. Overall, buy it if you're a NBA fan, there's no better option but ♥♥♥♥ 2K needs to fix their ♥♥♥♥.			"

												The MyCareer story is a huge upgrade over last year's story. Several cool features have been added (including additions to MyGM/MyLeague). Gameplay-wise this game really feels a lot smoother than ever before, though the CPU in the game got a lot tougher (which is good!).The only problems I truly have with this game, is the fact that the archetypes limit you to been more of a role player instead of a true superstar. I get the point that I might be more balanced in online modes, but since I don't really MyPark or Pro-Am, I kind of miss the fact that I can't be my own GOAT.Some minor things that bother me are that you start at 55 overal as an All-american High school player. The story tells you that you are by far the best player on your College team, but usually (if you don't buy VC) you have no stat upgrades yet. It's kind of saddening to see 2K follow the EA's / Activision's of this world in money grabbing.I still recommend the game, but 2K could've definitely been a bit more lenient towards the start of MyCareer.

												Its hevier then last year's game not becauuse better cpu intelligence but for cpu cheating. Mine players start to miss a dunks, playing no defence, missing balls and cpu players hitting difficult shots at 70% rate. Dificulity in domination is too hard. You need real cash to get some decent players or heavy grinding , of course you need more vc than last year to buy packs. This is probably my last nba 2k. And now they banning people for buying cheap cards and sell them for higher price. Really?????			"

												I did not want to rush to write this review. I also did not want to continue playing due to the addiction I felt developing. Yes, in just over an hour, addiction began. The first basketball game I really liked was ""Double Dribble"" after that it was the first ""NBA LIVE"" and after that I gave up on basketball games. None of them gave me the immersive feeling that the racing or flying titles of the same era were giving me. Today when I saw 2K17 was free for the weekend, I jumped at the chance because I know what 2K does. The career mode plays like a movie. That movie stars You. You as in You make a player that looks like You. They even have an app for your phone that will take a picture and send it to the game so the player will look closer to You look. I did not take a pic because I spent enough of my free weekend toying with the player looks. My son says the player looks like I at least tried to make me. I had to turn the career off because the cinematic ""filming"" and theattention to the details of the ""movie"" were making me forget that there are other game modes. As a Kings fan, I appreciate the accuracy of all of the jerseys and the logos in the Golden One Arena. The ""on air"" sports casters sat and spoke at the desk before the pre-game show. the pregame show came on. By this time I was fully entertained and ready to watch the game. Thats when I remembered it is a game and I cant just watch unless I set it to do so. Thanks to Mr. Cousins' skill and determination, we sent Mr. James and his backup dancers home with a loss. This game has me talking like a sports fan. The cameras transtition, pan, rotate and zoom all like a real bradcast. The gameplay is smooth. The playerr control is also smooth (used a cheap controller) enough for a non-basketball player to move around witout frustration. I give this 3 thumbs up. this is the best Basketball game I have played. I recommend this to anyone who wants to feel like they are playing a broadcast. I also recommendd this to anyone who enjoys any type of basketball as there are several game modes. I also recommend this to fans of sports cinema.			"

												This game absolutely sucks! I am so dissapointed that I wasted 60 bucks on a dressed up version of 2k16. MyGm has NO difference besides league expansion and a more stunning menu. They even took things out like being able to set your scoring options and other things along those lines. Forget not being able to play the pre-order at midnight, the game itself is a cop out. They put all their time into MyCareer and i'm sure the stupid card game too. Game play still is atrocious. Solid 3 point shooters are airballing way too often, the shot meter doesn't always stop when it should like it has lag, there are horrible fouls when the defense takes charges as you are merely running down court. Shooting is worse, user offense still turns the ball over WAY too often and AI never misses an open shot. Oh and about every game I have at least one player with his arms invuisible so you can see through his arm holes in his shirt and his hands just float. Annoying as heck. So, with MyGm being criminally neglected, gameplay as bad as I've seen it and an overall sense of playing the same game with more glitches I give it a 1 out of ten. Here's to hoping they majorly overhall this with DLCs.(I always play MyGm and start with high potential but, low tanking, young players. This is a video game issue in general but, when my players are lower ranked, they still shouldn't just make elementry school mistakes to compensate for the fact that a user is controlling them and making them perform better than their rankings suggest. I have NO PROBLEM losing, but I do have an issue with terrible gameplay when I am playing well.) Seems like they just don't put enough into USER Vs AI games since so many have moved to online User Vs User, which I have no interest in. Don't put something in a game if you are going to ignore it and put crap out there. So, really, if you can't make an all AI team play realistically against a User team than, you shouldn't release the game, period.			"

												Been playing MyCareer for a while. Haven't played 2K series since 2014 and I gotta say, it got even worse.1. Starting with 55 overall is ridiculous and doesn't even match up with the storyline. Isn't my character supposed to be the high school sensation with nickname Pres? And drafted in first 10 picks or so if you do a fine enough job? And then start out by having 55 overall and start with 8 min playtime. How does this make any sense. 2. On top of my so called the best high school player starting with 55 overall, Justice Young, who had to play in college for 4 years has an overall rating of 89. How does that make sense again?3. Orange Juice4. VC crap. I don't know when they started using VC system to improve your skills but it's just ridiculous.Edit: Great, the more I play MYCareer, the only thing that I can find more are the cons. In this game, your abilities are extremely limited. It means you can never create a character like Stephen Curry. You can either only have his 3 pointing shooting or dribbling. Also, if you wanna increase your already limited enough upgrade cap, you HAVE to play MyPark. This is ridiculous. Why are you forcing people to play MyPark? That thing is already filled with bunch of cheat code users and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Maybe if they regulated and did something about them then MAYBE people would have played more on online. The contents of MyCareer can only get so far. It's already getting repetitive with all the stupid cut scenes that I'm not able to skip. At least in 2k12 I didn't have to deal with this and was able to enjoy my fully maxed out character. Now I can't even have that enjoyment because they want to limit people's abilities. If they're doing this to stop people from dominating so much on online, then it's already a HUGE FAILURE BECAUSE PEOPLE CONSTANTLY USES CHEAT CODE IN ONLINE.Thanks for the lesson though. I'm gonna make sure that I do further research before I buy any 2k NBA games again			"

												It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again.Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing MyCareer, and so far it's 10/10.Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the MyNBA2K17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily VC. #sellout			"

												EARLY IMPRESSIONS 5 HOURS IN:The best sports series in the world just keep improving. Runs well, looks gorgeous, atmosphere in the stadiums is amazing, defense is improved, the gameplay is vastly improved, My Career is a good deal better this year and the fun factor is out of this world. If you are a basketball or sports fan, pick this up asap.How does it run? It runs very well! I am playing on a 660 ti and a decent i5 and I have everything at highest settings @ 1080p, getting steady 60 fps (only time it has gone below was duing my career, every other mode it stays at 60fps). Also have not had any crashes yet.For me the most important aspect for a sports game is GAMEPLAY. One reason I loved NFL 2k5, Blades of Steel, NBA Jam and NHL 94 so much back in the day, the gameplay! 2k has ripped the competition apart lately, Madden isn't what it use to be, NHL has had a few bad years,etc.. 2k could put out a crap game and get away with it but this here is the best 2k in years and so far a very ncie improvement over last years game.Not had any crashes or low fps so far to, imo the pc version is very good from what I have played so far. I have also tried the xbox one version and the PC version compares nicely. Oh yeah and lastly there is WAY less hackers online, I heard 2k was going at hackers hard this year, but never thought it would be to this degree, well done (last year I saw 5 hackers in the first few hours I was online, zero so far in this).I will comeback and add more to this review as I get more time with the game. But as someone who has played EVERY 2k game since it started, this just might be the best one yet. So far my only complaint is that the srevers could be a bit better on MY PARK, while slightly better than last years MY PARK (where you meet other players to use you're created player against), there is still room for improvements.Unlike a game like ProEvolution Soccer, this PC version is actually very well done and not an after throught to the console versions, you can tell 2k put a good amount of work on it. So far this is an excellent sports game and probably the best sports game since Rocket League imo.This is the best 2k basketball game since 2k8 and imo the best sports game overall since NHL '94ADDED IMPRESSIONS AFTER 102 HOURS =102 hours in now, I must say.. this game has A TON OF CONTENT. My Career is improved aswell, alot more to do in between games and the atmosphere/presentation is even better than years past, it really pulls you in. Enjoying it alot so far*			"

												As much time as I've put into this NBA 2K game, the hundreds of hours I've put into prior NBA 2K games, and also including the countless time I will put into this game from now on, I still can not, and will not recommend NBA 2K17 - or any NBA 2K game for that matter. I really do enjoy NBA 2K17: The MyCareer mode is great this year, the story is fleshed out enough to keep you interested, but not blown out proportionally that it becomes a laughing stock - especially compared to Spike Lee's awful attempt at an NBA story last year. (Not to mention Michael B. Jordan does a great job as Justice Young, the on court sidekick to your MyPlayer.) My only problem with MyCareer is that you can no longer simulate single matches without starting the match first and then pressing ""Sim to End"" from the pause menu. You always have to play a match to be able to do anything else in MyCareer.The mechanical side of the gameplay has really been improved, defense in particular; you can really put a good amount of effort in on D, and you will almost always have positive results, assuming you know what you're doing. Defense has always been a fault in NBA 2K games, you would often feel like you couldn't do much more than you did and still get beaten to the basket by the opponent. ISO moves have also been slightly improved, feeling less slippery, but also somewhat harder to use; you really have to practice the input timing, the distancing from the defensive player, and also have good enough court vision that you don't clumsily spin into another off ball player. I must say that sometimes it feels like the AI defense feels a little too good at spotting your movements; if you are expecting to drive the basket all the time, smashing the ball into the net, it is likely not going to happen, unless if  you are an NBA 2K master. The game really asks you to keep moving the ball around, because the AI defense will stick to you like white on rice. Moving onto what completely shuts down any positive outlook I have for this game. The single player experience is fantastic, in fact sit me down on a couch with a few friends for some offline multiplayer and we'd have a blast, but as soon as you bring the internet into the mix everything starts to go wrong. After years of NBA 2K releases you would think they would for once aim to make the online play work flawlessly, but that is once again not the case. it feels like all online modes are riddled with latency issues atleast 50% of the time, and sometimes the game likes to freeze up, telling you ""WAITING FOR OPPONENT"" but the game somehow still continues behind the frozen state. The My Park matchmaking is awful, actually there is no matchmaking - you would expect there to be some kind of balancing system in place to find a game, but instead you have to race other players for a place on one of the 9 courts, and hope a ""squad"" doesn't waddle in and steal up the match you've been queueing for, for the last 10 minutes.Pro-Am isn't the worst, but it does still have the latency issues, and not to mention that it often feels like in online matches your MyPlayer's stats are decreased considerably, as shots you take in Pro-Am, that would always be guaranteed baskets in offline play, often completely miss, no matter how open your MyPlayer is. The micro-transaction system has been hugely boosted this time around, 2K really want you to spend more money this year. And yes, I did - I know I'm only helping the terrible micro transaction system, but the grind it would take to get to a level where you can compete on a similar level to the other micro-transaction boosted players, and to even play at a level that is enjoyable would take such a long time that I caved in. I just wish you could carry your player over from the prior year, or just shorten the grind to level your stats. Either way after paying out for micro-transactions, you have to grind for a long time anyway to continue levelling your MyPlayer after a certain point, and that takes a long time in it's own right. So in conclusion/TL;DR: + Improved MyCareer, better overall story+ Improved Gameplay Mechanics+ Good offline play- latency issues online- Lag issues online- Unimproved matchmaking- MyPlayer feeling ""Debuffed"" online- Micro-Transaction pushed THROUGH THE ROOF I will continue to pray for the next NBA 2K game to be the one we deserve.

												So I can talk only about singleplayer/myCareer since I didn't play any multiplayer. As far into the game the story is good and it runs perfect for me. But if I compare 2k17 with 2k16 I would say that 2k16 would win here. I like it more than 2k17. 2k17 is harder to play and CPU is playing more defensive game. Movement is also a bit different in 2k17 and ball intercepting isn't correct in my opinion. I was standing in front of player and he still somehow got the ball through me. Getting currency is also harder and its kind of a farming type. You get less currency in 2k17 unless you will play extreamly good which isn't that easy at the beginning. You can buy it but that would ruin everything. I would say that player upgrades should be based on its work so you would play matches and attend practices and get a better player and not pay for it.I would still recommend 2k17 because it is a good game to play but if you already have 2k16 stick to it. 2k16 in my opinion is still a better game. Anyway on shot 2k16 is easier to play than 2k17 and for me it is a better game. Another bad thing is that you can't skip some cutscenes or some timeouts.			"

The gameplay is much better than previous titles and the new animations are great. The MyCareer is sort of cringey (cringey as hell, actually), but it's decent. The game also runs as smooth as butter (i7-4790k and GTX 970), if you have performance problems you just have to update your drivers. All in all, I think it's a great game.

So the game I spent $120 remains nigh-useless for me, and i'll not see a cent back. Thanks, 2K, thanks. My support experience: Me: Hi, i've tried everything on the troubleshooting guide and can't get past account creation.2k: Verify Game Cache, reinstall DirectX, reinstall Vcredist.Me: Did all that. 2k: Okay, give us your 2k account email!Me: I'd love to, but that's my problem.2k: (gives me a list of 7 different websites/ console commands to screenshot)Me: (supplies all the requested screenshots)2k: alright, so your 2k account email is ""******@****.com""?Me: ... I don't have a 2k account, that's my whole issue.14 days i've owned this game. Online wont connect, although it works fine for the friend I bought it for. (only bothered to get 2K17 for the online). Tried all of their recommendations on the FAQ. Tell me why in the ♥♥♥♥ I should have to wait 14 days, probably many more, to play a game I payed $120 for? Support responds with copy/pasted replies and i've yet to get any support for my issue. Single-player is fine if you dont want to use any of the rewards you payed $40 for. Just ridiculous.			"

												Worst NBA 2K game ever! I am a fan of this game and recommended it to my friends all the time, not anymore. Despite of MyTeam being pay to win from the very start of the game because of the very expensive prepurchase bonuses, MyCareer mode is buggy and glichty as hell. There is a very bad voice synch problem with the cinematics and even in the game which makes loading screens, cinematic dialogs and commentary very frustrating. Even the game freezes because of that. In cinematics sound stops but animation of the characters goes on yet, their mouth freezes where the sentence cut off. If subtitles are off, sound continue from the timer of what the character has to say synching with the animation, yet if they are on, they continue from where they were. So cinematics end but the sound tries to continue. Loading screens are really frustrating too and I guess it is about the sound problem. It takes 20 minutes to load a game and I got a pretty good PC. It stops nearly at 39% and waits there for like 10 minutes then I hear Shaq speaking even the pregame show was over and I am looking at the black screen. And it stops at nearly 60-70% then I have to wait for 10 minutes more. While these waiting process music is gone too. And the commentary... Sound stops when they are trying to describe a situation and an attack later they describe the former position. Man this is pure s***! If there won't be any updates soon this s*** will be my last NBA 2K game!			"

												When this game came out I was excited to buy it but now here are some crucial bugs and failures that everyone should be aware of before buying it:CONS:- it's more like NHL and not NBA; players are sliding around and not actually moving around- AI can push you back at anytime and you can't do that to it- you can stuck between two AI's at any time meaning you are out of your position- AI is just stupid and mindless- physics are just horrible at this state; you are right next to the ball and you won't pick it sometimes- AI dribbles you whenever it wants you to; usually it slides around you- your earning are ridicolous; it's all set up to make you to buy virtual points- don't be surprised if there will be some AIs without their hand moving artound- you can't skip scenes- lots of bugs - average graphics (compared to NBA 2K16)PROS:+ still a solid game which has to be worked on+ career mode is much better+ you feel connected with the game+ it's still a fresh game which hopefully will be worked onDo I recommend this game? Not at this stage...maybe later when they fix some game breaking bugs and this will work much better. NBA 2k16 is a better choice ATM.			"

												This game is one of the best sport wise and if you like basketball then this is the purchase for you but now a bit detailed.Pros:My career -  really well made besides your nickname, I feel it being a bit stupid to be honest. If it is your first charter you're making, then the cutscenes are even enyojable, well a bit. I also believe that they have added option to skip them, which is really nice.MyGm/MyLeague - you get what you need, control a team(s) fully and costumize whatever you want. Nothing more to say because it can offer you to bring multiple championships to your favorite franchiseMyTeam - play games, get money, buy cards, play more, get more money, buy more cards. Intersting if you fancy grinding for somethingPlay now Online - pretty intersting game mode, you can pick an NBA team and play against other online players with different NBA team. Couple of first games are easy, but then the players get advanced and will evetually make you quit because you suck.Cons:VC points - pay real dough to buy some couse grinding for them is annoying, after the last update they even nerfed the gains even moreMyTeam online and play now online -  full of people who dont play but somehow crash your game so you lose without even entering the game, hope they get aids and die :) Also waiting times  to find a game in evening in Europe are quite high, especially in play now online mode, and when you get into a game there is a great chance that you will lose it without even playing itMyCareer - each time you will get a reach-in foul a fantastic catch phrase ""I approve that steal. Presidential pardon"" will appear and eventually drive you nutsAll in all you can buy it mostly for single player expierience, because playing online with other people will mostly give you cancer.

												I hate to do this but i can not thumb up this game for several reasons. Now do not get me wrong I love the gameplay of this game. I am a big fan of the MYteam and that part of the game is what I am writing this review off of. When i first started playing i had a game breaking glitch where every game no matter what mode I was in began in the 4th quarter with 2 minutes to go and down 8 points. It took me 30 minutes to find a reputable solution that involved me deleting game files to fix it. So after almost refunding the game i finally get to play and I notice domination is now 5 minute quarters instead of 6 like last year and the teams are more difficult as well. This wasnt all bad as it made me try a bit harder to get through the regular domination but was far more frustrating than I had expected.So i got a bit further got some decent players and went into MYteam online mode where you play in leagues. I got out of bronze quickly but once I hit silver league I have not been able to complete a game without a hacker/exploiter ruining the game. My last 2 games have ended in the 4th quarter with me up by 10 or more points only to have a message pop up saying unexpected error has occured and this game will not be counted. I no longer will play this game which is sad since I paid full price for it only to be let down by glitches and hackers that 2K could care less about and especially for PC gamers.			"

												The game is actually not that bad. The overall story is a huge step up from spike lee's mistake known as NBA 2K16 MyCareer. The gameplay is more refined and balanced. You have to actually work in the game to improve your attributes with the Doin' work mechanic. The charaters in the story and the cutscenes are likeable. I don't even think I'm finished with the story yet in all honesty. I also really liked how you start in college and go international for a season. Here's a list of the pros and cons in the gamePros:BalancedRefined gameplayDecent StoryGood sidekickBetter league transitionsCons:some audio bugsMechanics are new in the game so they're bound to have bugs and a learning curveOverall, it's a fun game.

												Just because there is no alternative, we can't have a basketball game that allows us to play a decent basketball game. First EA ruined it, now 2K. Graphics alone doesn't mean anything, gameplay is the most important aspect of the GAME for gods sake, and the gameplay in this one... You can't play without saying ""bulls*!?*it"" per minute. I played basketball in my youth, I know how to play, I know what you can physically do and what you cannot. It has no relevance with this game. This is an arcade game that wants your money every turn. Sonic was a better basketball game.All jokes aside, the game doesn't move forward. This is very frustrating. The poor handles, unrealistic AI, sloppy and stupid moves, fixed animations etc. the list goes on. Each year we deal with the same problems. Oh yea right, we also deal with a new kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t each other year. My mistake. This year it is ""Orange Juice"". Don't let me start on this one. It's just plain horsecrap.Real players with experiences give down grades. Unfortunately there are some positive reviews, and by positive I mean kissass positive, which sound exactly like IGN kind, thus can mislead you.And all these, just for the offline part of the game... For the online part, just watch a season of Game of Thrones.PS: I forgot, I'M NOT ♥♥♥♥ING MURICAN, AND NOT INTEND TO BE ONE! So why forcing me to be an American and try to make me feel proud about something I couldn't care less? What were you thinking 2K? Seriously? Didn't you learn anything about last years Spike Lee disaster?			"

												This is one HECK of a game!My hand/eye coordination is pretty lousy and I had reservations about trying a controller-based action game like this, but I am a basketball junkie and the vids I'd watched online looked absolutely fantastic.In addition to my lousy hand/eye coordination, I was a horrible basketball player when I was a kid and never played on a team or tried to coach later on....  Those factors and the fact I hadn't tried any sort of sophistacated graphics-based basketball game in any series for a long time meant I was *waaaaaaayyyyyyyy* behind the 8-ball on learning this game and getting any good at it.Long story short, I still suck, but not so badly that I didn't outgrow the ""rookie"" level in just a couple games.  Took awhile to get ""too good"" at the next level (its name escapes me), but I am now playing at ""Pro"".  There are three higher levels that I'll never get good enough to play.   Ever.Because of those six play levels, I can't imagine anyone getting so good at the game that they can regularly beat the computer at the Hall-Of-Fame level.  Of course, just cuz I can't imagine it doesn't mean it's impossible...  But it'd be reallllly hard to do. Anyway...  This game is flat-out *AWESOME*!  I've finally figured out how to successfully do stuff like dunk and get a good running game going with my now-I-can-dunk Warriors.  Nipped the Spurs in a tough battle just now...The flow of the game is terrific, graphics sharp and smooth, at least with my snappy new gaming-level PC.  Yes, this game needs quite a bit of computing power to run well with graphics settings on High.  I would think most reasonably up-to-date ""everyday""-rated PC's would do okay on this game with video settings knocked down a bit, but to really enjoy this game at its best you'd probably need something pretty close to my rig (Intel i3 chip running at 3.9 Ghz, 16 gig RAM, Nvidea 970 GTX video card with 4gig rom).Thus far, I haen't done things like MyPlayer or MyLeague, and so far I have almost no interest in even trying them.  I've just played random games with me always controlling the Warriors.   LOTS of games!  Haven't tried any games against online opponents either, and don't really wanna try it.  So, on those sorts of features, I can't say anything.To those who are complaining about things like missing legs or arms on players or other strange graphics glitches...  UPDATE YOUR VIDEO CARD'S DRIVERS!!The few things I've gotten a little tired of would include things like the pregame and halftime shows (fun at first, but quite repetitive after not very long at all) and the really repetitive timeout huddles...  Oh, and the rather creepy-looking player and coach interviews where the lipsynch is rather off...  Fortunately, you can skip through these for the most part.Overall, this game just plain kicks butt!			"

												So far the best NBA 2K in years! I am still in the first season of myCAREER, starting out low as usual, still getting drafted among the top 20. So while every other NBA team picks up a 70+ player (some are higher), the Denver Nuggets decided to pick this white guy with an average rating of 55. And with hard work and no (real) money spent, thanks to ""Doin' the work"" and generous VC gifts from ingame sponsors and becoming a better player, I am, after 22 hours played, already a 74 average player. And the growth continues. ""Doin' the work"" is actually an uncomplicated system, also gives you minor improvements for free and allows you to raise the ten skill categories which you spend your VC on (besides Badges, clothes and stuff for your private court).The story is actually not terrible. You team up with Justice Young (played by Michael B. Jordan) and form the dynamic duo ""Orange Juice"", which actually sounds completly batshit insane in the beginning but it's not as horrible as being called ""Frequency Vibrations"" in 2K16. It also unlocks a major feature of the game, the duo-controls which enables some great plays. You even get a voice that seems to match most ethnic groups you can choose from and the story is not horrible at all. Your mom only calls on the phone, your father is dead and so there is no major drama except for the stuff that happens in the team or if you decide to skip on (team) training. No Spike Lee is also a major improvement.Technically the game runs flawless for me except for some black players sometimes losing their arms in the middle of the game. If somebody could explain to me now why my player always has to walk so many ways to leave places I would be really happy. Did nobody test the game before and figured out it's beyond annoying?			"

												NBA 2K17 was one of the few NBA games I have played, at all. I have to say I thought the offline play was decent but Online play was more than a questionable experience. I don't know if I would recommend this to anyone other than NBA2K fans, but even then I feel like I would get mixed responses.

												This year of NBA 2k17 might be my all time favorite.  The "" My Career"" mode, in my opinion, is better and more immerse than it ever has been.  Overall I love this game except a few things that you may want to take into consideration before spending $70 on this game.  First, due to the ♥♥♥♥♥how of an offseason it was in the nba, if you wish to play online, prepare for players who believe that golden state is the only team in the game.  As you could expect from a sports game, it is somewhat laggy when playing online and has issues connecting you to games.  Wait timer seems to always lie to me or never appear.  This game is A GRIND FOR VC.  The my career is definelty goiing to be very time consuming for me as i have already put in 20 hours in a few days of owning the game.  If you dont want to put tons of hours into my career, then dont bother starting.  Besides that I love this game and only wished that online would be easier to run and more consistent with my wait timers. Hopefully these  bugs get fixed around when the season will start or in the next patch.  If anyone wants to play 2k ever add me as a friend and you can catch this L			"

												Who would have thought 2K would become what they set out to replace in the market.A buggy mess, an early access game if you will and an expensive one at that.The visuals have barely changed from 2K16 yet frame rates are much lower, plus, there is weird micro stuttering throughout (even when fraps reports 60fps). Players without arms and legs, transparent beards and hair and countless other bugs.Add all of that to the Pay 2 Win Virtual Currency crap and you have an embarrassment of a game. Something that also embarrasses the big name reviewers online who failed to pick up on any of this.			"

												Great game, the gameplay is solid and it looks beautiful. MYTEAM is very fun with lots of challenges and different things to do for rewards and such. MYCAREER is okay, it does get repetitive pretty fast and the storyline is a little too foolish for my liking, especially for a basketball game. I find the texting feature that your player has very annoying, also with some of the cutscenes being way too cheesy. It just don't suit a basketball game. Pro-Am is extremely really fun to play since you and your friends can make a team and play against other people online. This mode definitely doesn't get old. You can even customize your uniforms and arena which is pretty sweet. MYPARK is okay, it definitely isn't realistic at all, such as the crazy dunks, people dunk over you like you aren't even there and it's impossible to stop them. The alley-oops in park are also terribly unrealistic to the point where you can alley-oop people everytime even though the defender is all over them. But overall, the game is well done. If you like basketball, you should really check this game out!			"

												I just recently bought the game because it was on sale. I had it on PS4 so I know about some of the issues, for example that it's very similar to the 2K16 version. I started using common sense and changed to PC gaming but I have noticed one downside and that is the lack of sports games for PC (if you exlude motorsports) which is a shame, so the only reason why I'm giving this a positive review is because I feel like we need to acknownledge companies who still bother releasing a sports game for PC unlike those EA a**holes.

												For all those complaining about performance issues, worry not. Im running on a laptop, Nvidia Geforce 950m, i7-5700hq, blah blah blah. compared to a desktop obviously its nothing but for a laptop its pretty good. with that said, i expected decent graphics at least. when i started it up, the game was unplayable. Solution: make sure your graphcis card is on. desktops use dedictaed graphics all the time, laptops don't (to conserve battery). nvidia didn't update the drivers yet for this game, so i had to go into the nvidia control panel and enable this game manually. still not 100%, as it would be better if the drivers updated, but wow what a difference.Quick Tip: Update drivers. Check Geforce Experience, then check the website, as sometimes the Experience app thing can be a bit wonky, especially since the app itself updated.Hope this helps some of you out there.			"

												I don't see why all these people are having issues with this game...Lets first address all the ""OMG LAG"" comments. I have a GTX1080, 16GB of ram, and a stock i7 4790k. My machine is no slouch by any means, but I also stream at 1080P in 60FPS and this game still runs fine for me, those complaining about the FPS most likely haven't troubleshooted and/or updated their drivers yet.This is my first 2K game as well as my first sports game Ive owned on PC, yes it is strongly recommended to use a controller but that was no issue for me since I had a spare XBOX one controller laying around.MyCareer is one of the funnest experiences I've had in awhile, you create your own character (the face scan leads to some funny moments) and you can play on a basketball team and lead them to the championships. It does take awhile to get enough VC to upgrade your character, and the reach in foul calls get a little ridiculous sometimes, but those are the only complains I have.Now onto the complaints of the main game, Why in sweet ♥♥♥♥ can you not skip cutscenes? It also gets annoying watching your player (mycareer) leave your place every 5 seconds. Other than that I'd say this game is definitely worth the 60$			"

												This game is a laggy pos, all you ever do is get your ankles broken and the ball stolen constantly. if thats not happening. the refs are calling the stupidest fouls. You stand wide open at the 3 Point line with a 3 point shooter even with curry and 1/2 the time you will miss. the game is awful.			"

												Every single game has high percentage scoring for the AI. Also the game never ends with low scoring under 30 points. And I have the offensive settings to a LOW 30's......This game is broken. Completely BROKEN!!!!! The AI in this game is messed up so bad. Along with the comeback cheese. Why in the hell are my players all over the place leaving players open. Last year was so much more organized. I'm lost for words right now on how cheap this game feels. Btw I'm playing with the open box warriors (me) vs the cavs, I always test the game with the top two teams.....This also happens because sometimes 2k focuses on a certain area of the game like ""my player"" or whatever other garbage modes they have.  The inside shots for the AI makes me sick. Let me not get banned HAS anyone had their games ending with points in the high 30's yet??? This is how I test the settings. And so far each game is a free for all...#$%^&			"

												The negative reviews are filled with individuals with no patience. I couldn't play 2k17 when I first purchased it last night due to lack of keys, it's fixed now. Just wait and you'll get to play. The only valid thing I can see people getting upset about is the performance on certain systems. I personally haven't had any issues with running the game but I have seen posts about crashing and errors. If you can deal with the fact that you might have to wait for a key to play, you should buy this game. If you can deal with the fact that there could be some crashing (which will be fixed in a patch I'm sure) then buy this game. Please do not continue to post negative reviews about a temporary problem. Again, have patience.			"

												Offline this game is pretty decent. Mygm is great, and my career is decent. If your into playing these modes I would give it a 4/5. However if your in for myteam, mypark or pro am I got news for you it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. There are hardly any players ever in the courts. 2K also refuses to put a cheat engine in the game and they pretty much neglect the pc community almost entirely. It is a grind to upgrade your player and its pretty stupid that they put attribute caps in the game. Especially for pc since online mode sucks. Only get this game if you prefer to play offline. Online there is no cheat engine. If 2k actually put effort into its pc community than it would be much better. Also it is apparant that 2k is vc hungry and wants you to buy the game. While I havent played myteam this year based on previous experiences with 2k if you want to get good players you haft to put in $$ gone are the days of realistic noble grinding and being able to field of team based on skill. Online mode its pay to win. "

												Ok, so I have played this series for many generations now, since 2k13 and sadly every game has the same problem when playing against the AI. You're not playing the same game as the AI. It's borderline impossible to stop a drive from the AI if they drive you'll have to run alongside them and try to block their shot. If you try to drive against the AI It will almost never ever work because the AI's players have small invisible zones of no ballmovement around them and it's impossible to run past them. No like really, it's impossible.No I'm not making this up, it means that unless you have a clear path, like literally no one at all defending, you WILL get stoped and at best your player will grab the ball and you'll have to pass it. At worst your player will fumble the ball and you've made a turnover.This years version makes this even more frustratingly obvious because something that is ""new"" in career mode is that you'll have to grind drills in the gym against the AI. Sometimes it's just shooting hoops from one spot and that's uninteresting and tedious but manageble but then comes the 1v1 drills... they've designed a system where the AI is unbeatable 1v1 because you can't drive past them and they can just walk past you and you can't do anything to counterplay and they've implemented a system where you have to GRIND these drills. Makes my career almost unplayable.Now why, do you ask is it like this. Well because if it's not it's not very hard to faceroll the AI. Is it a good solution, no way in ****. The game is extremely frustrating to play and you will always have the feeling that it's stacked against you, because it is.There are some improvements, they've finally fixed the bug for some people where you could only play in offline mode or risk the game crashing the my career mode is less crap than it was last year but still worse than 2k15. The game is somewhat managable if you play a strong center and just avoid driving to the hoop alltogether. But all in all this is the same game as they released last year (and before that) with a new UI some minimal game changes and the only reason to buy it is because there is no competitor. FIFA 17 makes this look like a really bad joke in all aspects other than the, football is boring aspect.			"

												everything which was making me crazy in 2k15 (taht push me to not buy the 16 ) is all gone ! - bad menu gone and the new one is very clear and very good to navigate -slow navigation in menu : gone ! now it is quicker and loading time between every menu is quick enough :) -long time pause between each phase of the game : long scene and just wanted to click A ... GONE !! awesome !! now it is quicker ! faster !! push A and go play !! -everything is quicker ! the loading time etc ...... - the gameplay feel smoother ! gamepad feel more responsive !! and it is awesome !! -MyPark feel more quicker to do things like join a court etc .... it is awesome ! i follow some comments to buy the 17 version and i don't regret it !! it is a really good progress !! So Thank you 2K for the good job and keep going on this road for PC ! everything is better and it is as far the best NBA 2k ever created !! the game run smooth as butter !! everything is awesome in this version !! i was hating so much 2k15 !! in 2k17 everything is better !! buy it without regarding !! it is best nba2k ever created !!!!!!!! shot meter is great !! you just need few hours to adjust yourself to it !! and you know that people always cry for something !

												Contrary to some haters, this is a really fun basketball game.   The GM mode is a BLAST and the expansion team creation is super fun.  MyCareer is awesome and yeah you have to use VC to increase your character, but you earn VC for EVERYTHING in the game and you can earn it on the companion app.   I haven't played 2k since 12 so there is more new features than those moving up from 16, but if you buy every year, you are probably either a sucker or a super fan.  Now for the downside.  It's a sports basketball game, so increasing the level just feels like the computer cheats and rigs the outcome more.  Also Klay Thompson 3 pointer is jacked.   Other cons are charging is messed up players stick to other players too much in the paint causing 3 second violations way too frequently.   Don't be turned away from the haters.   Buy this game if you want a great basketball game that will be fun online and offline, don't buy this if you expect to be the best online player without spending gobs of real money.			"

												Love the NBA? Want to play an NBA game on the PC? Yes you say? Well, let me tell you a few things about this wonderful game! Have you ever wanted to decide between facing an invisible opponate online or giving your computer a sexually transmitted disease? We have you covered! Either disable your antivirus while playing online or you will have to defend against invisible players in mypark! Have you ever wanted  to get a middle finger from an A+ game devoloper? Yes? Well, I have great news for you! You get two middle fingers for the price of one! You get one middle finger for playing on the PC. You will be the last to receive patches, roster updates, or anything else game related. That is if you get a patch at all. Does not matter how broken the game is! You get that second special middle finger because 2K released a buggy mess this year to all the special boys and girls. PC and console alike. Have you played a game and thought, ""You know what this game needs? More random crashes.""? NBA 2k17 Legendary Mess Edition has you covered. You can expect that when you upgrade your char, a badge you have already earned will keep popping up and crashing your game. Who would have thought that 2K would combine the great feeling of watching your character progress with the feeling you get as your game winks out on you? Pure genius!Are you worried that they will fix the buggy mess that makes the game unplayable? Don't be! Do not forget that you are a red headed step child in 2K Sport's eyes. Your step brother Jimmy will get that shiny new BMX for Christmas, but not you. No, you will get the greatest gift of all. Socks. There is a 7gb patch for the PS4. They said it is coming soon to XBOX One. They made no mention of PC though . So, the good times keeps on rolling with random crashes and players missing arms and legs. With all these unsupported bad ports, it has never been a better time to be a PC gamer! Do you love game companies miliking you for money after you purchase their game at A+ game prices? Yes? Well some more good news. 2K really stepped it up this year. Every time you upgrade your char, the default position of your icon rests on the ""Purchase VC"" button. So, you will hit that a million times over the span of upgrading your character. Each time you hit it, you will be lovingly reminded how much 2K really cares about your wallet. I know you are probably thinking, ""Maybe I will wait to buy this Procious."". I get where you are coming from, but I have one sentence that will change your mind. Spike Lee did not write or direct for 2k17. Boom! You are now sold, right? I was too! All jokes aside: The game's storyline is better this year and it has better potiential than 2k16, but it is a buggy mess and it does not look like that is going to change anytime soon. If was not a Basketball game nut, I would not have logged the hours I have. I would wait for a good patch or not buy it at all.			"

												I gave this game as possitive because the game play is the best yet for 2k. I will tell you that the online portion of the game is so awful. It is full with bugs, and cliches. The 2k support team isn't helpful at all. All they do is tell you how YOU, YOURSELF, can fix the problem, and give you links to other site to help you learn how to be a 2k technical support employee. If your game starts to act up, you won't get much help from 2k.			"

												Well, what can I say.... This game is just awesome. The phisics feel right, the controls have improved and there's even quite the right feeling in the career mode.If only publishers wouldn't put so much  pressure on developers. Because I could just have gotten a great sports game. Instead what I bought is right now literally unplayable. Cinematics move in like quadrouple speed so that the sound is off and the sequences get cut short, while freethrows occur the whole screen starts shaking like an epileptic tasmanian devil on meth and the game crashes A LOT. Not only to desktop but even to black screens that force me to reset my PC because I can't even enter the task manager.So I wouldn't recommend buying the game now. They have to put in quite some work still.If it gets patched the right way though, this game will be REALLY good.I'd like to give a thumb sideways because of thet but I will give a thumbs down. I hope all people who are having technical problems with this game will do so as it will help the problem get noticed. And people will maybe read through reviews before buying an unfinished product.

												Any NBA fan will like this, despite the technical issues like fps drops, sometimes you won´t see the players limbs and some crashes.With the last update, I didnt suffer any crash tho.So, if you like the game, buy it, you´ll have A LOT of time to spend on the different modes and, why not, some laughs with the ""almost invisible"" players :D7/10EDIT: I´m going to add some things, for I´m seeing it has helped some of you.Yes, the cutscenes are not skippable, and some of them (majority) does not provide anything helpful, so you can skip them but no, you can´t.MyCareer mode is good in general but maybe you can find it kinda repetitive at the end (talking about trainings and the mode to improve your skill cap)MyPark is still the same, still good, you can find a lot of different playstyle here.MyGM/MyLeague: I think MyGM is underrated, actually I think this is the mode which can provide you with tons of hours and it has a deep system of modification, MyLeague is the same BUT you can control MORE than ONE team.I´m finishing.Still saying NBA2K17 is a good game, it has some problems which can, and will do, interfere with your gameplay experience but you´ll have fun playing it when no issues are in (which is sometimes, unfortunately)			"

												TL;DR: (6.75/10)The graphics and presentation are top notch but numerous gameplay problems hold it backGraphics: Awesome (9/10)2k has been getting this part right for a while. The players and courts look realistic and move in realistic ways (at least most of the time) The only problem I could point out is that some textures are inexplicably blurry despite being in a high resolution. This is easily countered by using something like ReShade to boost the sharpness, but it's worth pointing out.Presentation: Awesome (9/10)Any 2k fan worth their salt will tell you that this series has perhaps the best presentation of any sports game series. The commentary is organic and lifelike and the presentation is top notch. The attention to detail really shows! However, like graphics, there is one small problem worth pointing out: There's so much presentation that you have to mash the ""A"" button after just about every basket and especially before the game/after the game/between quarters to skip all of the flashy presentation just to get back to the gameplay with no way to turn it off.Game modes: Awesome (9/10)Ok, I admit, I've given the game a lot of credit with three straight 9 of 10's. The thing is that these three things are the things that 2k does better than ANYONE ELSE IN SPORTS GAMING. In fact, they've been the best since at least 2k11. There are so many game modes and each one of them is very well fleshed out. Only a handful of changes would make them better, and they're pretty much irrelevant. Customization: Good (7/10)2k is better than most when it comes to customization, but there is so much room for improvement here that if you're looking for a fully customizable experience, you won't feel disappointed, but there are other games that do just as good or better. One thing to note is the team relocation mechanic that allows you to fully customize the NBA and even add up to 6 teams to the assosiation in a variety of game modes. The problem for people who love to customize (Like myself) is that this option is ONLY available in certain modes and is not normally available through the main customization tools like player creation and roster editing. This is a major disappointment, and really needs to be remedied in 2k18 (or even patched into this game)!Gameplay: Passable (5/10)Here it is, the one thing 2k17 struggles with heavily! Unfortunately, this is the single most important part of the game for 99% of people! Here's a list of just some of the most glaring issues. (Many of these carry over from 2k15/2k16)-The game is slower than real life, players jog around the court and take floaty shots (set gamespeed to around 55-60 to fix this easily)-Animations are sluggish, this is especially the case with dribble moves as they are useless most of the time-It's entirely too easy to get drawn into animations, just run into the back of a player on a fast break to force them to slow down and let you get beside them or even pass them up while rarely drawing a foul in the process-The AI is all-knowing, making plays with its back turned on a regular basis and simply stands around rather than rotating on defense or getting open on offense-Layups are too easy to make meaning running toward the rim and spamming them is usually a winning strategy even on higher difficulties-Fouls are too easy to rack up as they get called too often-And-ones go in on a regular basis rather than making fouls mean something-Speed is non-existant in this game as players like Shaq can keep up with Allen Iverson in most situations-""FAST BREAK, WHAT FAST BREAK? PLAYERS DON'T HAVE UNCONTESTED FASTBREAKS!"" says the game. In 200+ hours I've had 1, YES 1, uncontested fastbreak despite telling players to run in transition-Invisible walls on the edge of the court put on extra ""Player Repellant"" this year, meaning that you can sometimes run head first out of bounds and get knocked back in by nothing to keep you in play-The mid range shot is useless in this game, open or not. Unless you're Michael Jordan.-Dunking in traffic is nearly impossible, leading to easy blocks on most of them even if you go up with two hands. Unless you're Michael Jordan.-Most of all, the game often considers ""well contested"" shots that would normally be open rendering stepback J's and shooting from screens pointless.If there are so many gameplay problems, then why recommend the game? Because most of the issues can be fixed by creating your own sliders for the game. After tweaking the settings, I would say that it gets closer to a 7.5/10 or so. If you don't want to make your own, then you can always download someone else's sliders, even mine if you want. The thing is that even my sliders aren't perfect and are constantly being updated for realism/balance/fun.			"

												Might be the worst 2K balance-wise, I have ever played !With your MyCareer Player starting at an AVG of 55 and a skill of a bad middle-school Player, this game is just fun to play when buying the deluxe-versions of the game to get unfair amount of VC from the beginning on. Its so frustrating to see your PG take a mid to close range jumpshot without anyone around him and getting an F as a quality. Every Player Ive ever played against in real life might shoot better then the Character you will be starting with. I am not recommending this game to everyone whos main focus will be the MyCareer-Mode. (and who is not willing to pay an extra amount of cash to have fun in the first 100 hours of the game, aswell.) Also all of those training session, in which you are forced to play a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 etc. against players, that drop 10-0 easily on you with their lateral quickness, arent a bit enjoyable at all.

												I ""played"" this game for 89 minutes.  I'll break down my actual gameplay time:-10 minutes total of character creation, menu navigating, setting options like camera/etc.-7 minutes of actually playing basketball.-62 minutes of watching a cutscene, the game crashing, rewatching the cutscene, the game crashing.  Finally it works, oh wait no it doesn't because it crashed again during the game instead of right after the cutscene.The cutscenes cannot be skipped and the game doesn't remember if you already watched them or not.  I watched the stupid Kobe MyCareer cutscene maybe 5 times, and that's a long one.I well exceed the minimum requirements for this game, as well as any other coming out in this day and age.  I'm not at the max specs either, but closer to max than min definitely.  A computer like mine not being able to run your game means that you are not optimizing your game well.I've played the NBA 2k series since back when Allen Iverson was on the cover and even when it was out on Dreamcast.  Literally my whole life has involved this game in some way or another.  It pains me to refund this game, the first time I ever refunded any game on Steam, but I just can't reasonably spend 60 dollars and then just hope that they patch the PC version.  And honestly, there's been so many problems with the 2k series since 2k15 that I'm just gonna stop buying these games until these issues are helped.Is this game good for a casual basketball fan?  Probably.  It has nice graphics and smooth gameplay like all the others.  But to anyone who actually knows the game well and expects certain kinds of behaviors by the AI, you'll be infuriated.  I already saw videos about how the help defense problem is still there, the shots the AI makes on high difficulties, etc.  The VC gouging once again back strong.  I just can't do it anymore.			"

												So after finishing my 1st season as an NBA Pro winning Rookie of the Year as well as taking home the Title for my team Utah Jazz, I decided to take my talents elsewhere. I had suspected early on with the new ""Orange Juice"" thing that you're pretty much going to be stuck with Justice Young for the rest of your career. Well I was correct, I get signed to a new team in hopes of going solo but no Justice just came along with me, which I don't understand how teams could afford both of our salaries but whatever. I get that Michael Jordan is a big perk for the game but it's almost too easy considering you have another teamate that will for sure put up numbers for your team so the whole time it's like having a handicap in which I don't like about MyCareer.    Also If you're a fan of the series or have been and played through 13-16, you will notice that Jackson Ellis appears in these games as well, I've made it my personal mission to not accept any requests to hangout with him due to he's a d-Bag in the other games, long time rival, blah blah blah. Screw Ellis he sucks ain't even on the same level. Game mechanics are dope, some of the dunks are gone but nothing that damages the game... There are many of the game modes that I haven't gotten a chance to play around with yet but overall the game is just what you would expect from 2K nice solid gameplay, a few hiccups here and there but If you're decent at the game you will fly through games with a pretty nice stats.   I don't usually rate games but this one I will have to give a 8.5 out of 10 mainly because of the Justice Young thing in MyCareer, somehow 2K finds a way to screw with the MyCareer when all we really want is to work our way up from the bottom, dominate, collect badges, get buckets, make VC, without a whole story pre-made... If they gave the option like a multi-layer choice based system, I don't see why this game couldn't take on other franchises such as FIFA which does a phenomenal job at everything they do with that game. That being said, pick it up cheap or wait until next year or keep playing the previous year because you're not missing too much.			"

												This is the best NBA game that is released ( Thats how it should be, becouse this is a newest game :P )Gameplay looks good, feels good and its great progression from 2K16! It looks and feels bit more dynamic to play and everything is so much smoother and more working than in 2K16. Gamemodes are same ones, but MyTeam is now much better. There is clear difference between singleplayer and multiplayer, cards are now different and online is better. MyCareer uprgaded great way. No more Spike Lee, but when Spike was there, you can skip the cutscenes. Now you have to watch everything. Thats only minus that I found. Attributes are amazing now! MyGM and MyLeague are worth of testing! I dont know why people hate this game! Controller works perfectly, I dont have any bugs or lags or problems receiving bonuses from Legends Gold!GOOD GAME 10/10 "

												It's unfair for players who aren't very good... I was playing myteam online, amnethyst leagea. Had 7:0 and needed only 1 win to get reward, but was matched with player from pink diamond prestige 2 league, so you answer me, is it fair to match players from different leageas and different levels? If it was just one league higher it wouldn't matter, but now..... And of course I wasn't able to get reward....			"

												So after finishing my 1st season as an NBA Pro winning Rookie of the Year as well as taking home the Title for my team Utah Jazz, I decided to take my talents elsewhere. I had suspected early on with the new ""Orange Juice"" thing that you're pretty much going to be stuck with Justice Young for the rest of your career. Well I was correct, I get signed to a new team in hopes of going solo but no Justice just came along with me, which I don't understand how teams could afford both of our salaries but whatever. I get that Michael Jordan is a big perk for the game but it's almost too easy considering you have another teamate that will for sure put up numbers for your team so the whole time it's like having a handicap in which I don't like about MyCareer.    Also If you're a fan of the series or have been and played through 13-16, you will notice that Jackson Ellis appears in these games as well, I've made it my personal mission to not accept any requests to hangout with him due to he's a d-Bag in the other games, long time rival, blah blah blah. Screw Ellis he sucks ain't even on the same level. Game mechanics are dope, some of the dunks are gone but nothing that damages the game... There are many of the game modes that I haven't gotten a chance to play around with yet but overall the game is just what you would expect from 2K nice solid gameplay, a few hiccups here and there but If you're decent at the game you will fly through games with a pretty nice stats.   I don't usually rate games but this one I will have to give a 8.5 out of 10 mainly because of the Justice Young thing in MyCareer, somehow 2K finds a way to screw with the MyCareer when all we really want is to work our way up from the bottom, dominate, collect badges, get buckets, make VC, without a whole story pre-made... If they gave the option like a multi-layer choice based system, I don't see why this game couldn't take on other franchises such as FIFA which does a phenomenal job at everything they do with that game. That being said, pick it up cheap or wait until next year or keep playing the previous year because you're not missing too much.			"

												The game is amazing... But I wouldnt give it a 10/10 because the game will randomly crash in the middle of the game. It happens a lot that when I have like 30 points by the 4th quarter the game will freeze then a few seconds later crash and you lose all your progress.			"

												This game is unbelievably bugged. I've played only for a few hours but have already experienced several bugs1. I've caught the time running while waiting to inbound a pass2. CPU started intentionally fouling me when there is like 50seconds left and im only up by 1. And when I did get fouled through the bonus it only gave me one shot instead of two. LOL?3. Even after tampering with Vertical sync all of my cut scenes are still being played at 3x regular video speed, and 1x audio speed and always end abruptly without seeing all of the content.4. Just did one of my first shoot arounds on myplayer, I was almost completely done filling that top practice bar then all the sudden the practice teammate started derping around trying to pickup the ball. It went on for 20 minutes and wouldn't allow any button on controller or keyboard to exit/save or anything. I had to alt-f4 and lose the experience. the Cpu ran around the court non stop trying to pick up the same basketball.5. Want to play with a 360 controller and a ps4 controller with a friend? Goodluck. Causes massive issues and constantly randomly disconnects your controller. You seem to have to use the exact same controller for every player.More things I don't like:1) MyTeam is confusing, It may have been like this in other games but why.. I make a team, My court is defaulted to the Hawks, yet Im from New York, Scoreboard says Timberwolves and i'm wearing the wizards jerseys. Like wtf. Who approves this stuff? 2K, your desire for dlc/paid content has gone too far and its just straight up confusing for new players.2) Curry is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly op. I know hes insane in real life. I love to watch it. But I played against a friend who I normally beat with the Knicks. He dropped 42 points with curry himself in one game. 80% of those shots were deep, chuck shots over coverage. Like 40 footers under heavy coverage..  42 points, (and this is half game length of real life. So essentially on track for 84 points in real life. And he is a noob like me taking low percentage shots. I understand he should be really good. But thats just ridiculous. The sliders were on default - Pro difficulty3) The substitution/timeout design is horrid. 2k16 was wayy better and user friendly. Its very awkward trying to read all these player names sideways and upside down. It is also very awkward to access the other menus like setups/defensive tendencies.4) PC online gameplay forces you at 60fps. I want to use my 144hz monitor!5) No chat box/quick comms like Rocket League, On the MyPark blacktop there no way to communicate with other players			"

												我觉得这是2k系列里最差的一部，我几乎每天网上睡觉前都会玩一局，我从2k13一直玩到现在从来没对游戏这么失望过，如果不是死忠粉就不要买了太差bug：1.创建角色里深色皮肤到游戏里显示深色皮肤绿色脸 2.非常深的板凳球员到场上来打垃圾时间显示没有胳膊 3.裁判经常拿着球不给你（超过一分钟），尤其是边线发球和罚球玩法： 1.抢断太简单，两个后卫一见面按一下抢断就立即掉球或者抱住不动，如果遇到抢断比较好的就直接一下断下来了 2.投篮防守对投篮的影响非常小，能投进就是能投进，不能投进就是不能投进 3.回场不敏感，半只脚过去了都不吹 4.主场优势太大，边缘球员可以在主场优势下疯狂进球，明星球员就是进不去一个 5.为什么有时候明明投篮条都绿了还投不进 6.经常看到对面电脑各种乱运球转身然后球还没拿就一个三分进了（还是那种不怎么会投三分球的）			"

												Mechanics are great, animations are great, VC Grinding is bad but what the heck.This game had it all on point and with Spike Lee gone, it kills me to not play it. Cheaters in MyPark are slowly getting banned and that should calm most buyers down as I have not seen any non-legit 90+ overall so far as I'm concerned. Its pretty easy to get to 90 on MyCareer in a week or two. This game has whole lots of fixes. It runs great on my GTX 980 at 60hz with VSync ON. My only problem is that at 120 hz, all the cutscenes get messed up and fast forwards all the time and is as expected as this was noted by 2k while changing your refresh rate settings. Overall, this game is worth the buy if you have the time to play it but not a great buy when time is a big factor for you in playing this game's modes other than casual ""Play Now!"" gaming.			"

												I've played the 2K series exclusively on consoles. I first acquired an NBA 2K game with NBA2K16. I don't recommend 2K17 for the same reason I refuse to recommend 2K16...IT DOES NOT RUN AS INTENDED AT ABOVE 60HZ WITH VSYNC DISABLED.Audio is out of sync, pre-game shows do not run all the way. It's the same problems that 2K has neglected to address. If 2K17 wasn't gifted to me, I would return it. This is a perfect example of PC gamers taking a back seat to the console versions.			"

												The core of the game is good. There's a lot more to the game than what you may think on the surface. Quite a lot of skill required in order to be able to compete online either in my team or park. The problem with the game is the connection. I've been told the only servers for the PC version of the game reside in America so playing online from Europe results in 130ms+ ping. The online is unplayable as a result. If the PC market for 2K was bigger allowing for a european server the game would be so much better.Great game, Unplayable netcode for europeans.			"

												Great single player career mode. However career mode could benefit if it could be less US-centric. For example you and your sidekick are forever known as ""orange-juice"", and even if you change your nickname, the game still will call you ""PREZ"" in alot of commentary and all cut-scenes. I just want to be called Rainman :(Cutscenes need to be more dynamic - for example, changed teams, cut scenes still on story arc of the sidekick being traded.Being from NZ the single player PC appears to be dead in MyPark and ProAM.I have played since 2k5 or something rediculous. Would be a great game if 2K could fix the bugs and online modes. Otherwise will just stick to offline MyTeam and Career.#ForeverAlone			"

For example you and your sidekick are forever known as ""orange-juice"", and even if you change your nickname, the game still will call you ""PREZ"" in alot of commentary and all cut-scenes. I just want to be called Rainman :(Cutscenes need to be more dynamic - for example, changed teams, cut scenes still on story arc of the sidekick being traded.Being from NZ the single player PC appears to be dead in MyPark and ProAM.I have played since 2k5 or something rediculous. Would be a great game if 2K could fix the bugs and online modes. Otherwise will just stick to offline MyTeam and Career.#ForeverAlone			"

												This game is utter garbage. Too many cheaters online. When I play against the computer on All-Star it cheats. Whenever I make a 3-pointer (which hardly happens but the CPU on the other hand always makes them) the CPU always returns the favor no matter how much I defend. For instance, Lebron ran through 4 of my defenders and dunked. NOPE! NOT POSSIBLE. My team runs around and doesn't stay on the person they're supposed to be defending. Instead i notice them move out of the way and let the other team go right in for a free-bee. CPU runs right through you like a ghost. I can't control every person!  My team can't rebound worth ♥♥♥♥ like the CPU can. They can't even make wide open 3's (I play warriors and I shoot 3's with Curry, Durant, Green, and Clark). Okay I can't make my 3's, then drive in. NOPE! Try to juke them, STOLEN! Try to run in, CHARGING! FOUL AFTER FOUL. They get all these free throws. I try to block, FOUL! Okay noted, just stand their instead. NOPE! My player will automatically block for me if I don't click it. FOUL! Like I said at the beginning... UTTER GARBAGE. The real players cheat and so does the CPU. Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ed up game. It is nowhere near real basketball. All the games are already planned out.			"

												Looks great and plays well, but ONLY if you have a gamepad! This game will see that you do not have a gamepad installed and will tell you how the game is more difficult to play without one. But of course it doesnt, however, change its tutorial mode to explain the keyboard shortcuts. Only the gamepad commands are explained.Other than that it looks like any other sports game with the same type of famillar interface and gameplay you have grown to like over the years. If sports games are your thing I think you will enjoy this.I got this during a free preview but did NOT purchase it. Not a game I would spend a lot of time playing but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid basketball game! "

												NBA2K17... Where do I begin... To begin with, I have played NBA since 2010 and seeing the game evolve makes me happy, but there are still some major issues that the devs have to deal with, which I feel like should've been fixed by nowPros:+ Graphics and player faces looks amazing, this is the most realistic nba game ever made imo+ MyCareer being better than ever and all the other modes too! Really enjoy playing everything+ If you're a MyTeam fan, you will most likely get content each weekI wish I could add more pros for this game but there are too many issues I feel like to do so for now...Cons: - Glitches and animations while playing matches, for an instance, some bodyparts of some players would dissapear, and all the BS animations that you are familiar from earlier games still exist to some degree. - A program called Cheat Engine is used to modify the game, MyTeam for the most part. On console, the max you can list a player for is 100k, but using cheat engine, the price can be set to whatever creative amount you want, and to some degree this is game-braking... Especially if you're going to collect 2.5K cards for the best card in the game (debatable) this also makes VC useless in MyTeam since you're going to need a s*** loads of MT to afford just a 87-89 rated card... This has been a problem for 3 years so do not expect a patch...- VC is very overpriced (IMO) and VC ( the currency used in NBA2K games ) is pretty much needed for most activites within the game... The game is really fun but if you're going to buy it, you should get it for console if you have the chance. Would not recommend buying it on PC if you're going to play MyTeam, but every other mode should work fine...Giving this game a 7/10 simply because of the graphics and great modes , would've given higher if 2K would start work on theese PC problems that has existed for a long time			"

												Reasons I hate this game: 1. No prelude. 2. 45 minutes after expected release date it is announced casually in a reply to a tweet that the game comes out 12 hours later then promised. 3. I can't play My Career games with controller (they won't work when u enter my career game. And same thing happened last year except with online play, but there was a fix discovered.) Those 3 things are the only bad things about this game so far though, and if they fixed controller bug I would give this game a positive review, but for now don't buy this game.IF YOU FIND FIX FOR CONTROLLER GLTICH PLS COMMENT ON THIS REVIEW ASAP. THANK YOU.Summary: Rn Pc version is worse than Kwame Brown.Ps: Unlike most people, I have no FPS problems with low graphics settings (and I have a horrible computer)Edit: Found fix!			"

												This game was fun at first, but it becomes a ridiculously steep grind fest or a ridiculously expensive ""pay to play"". I enjoyed MyCareer mode, but anytime you start a new character you have to watch every single cutscene again with no option to skip them. You have to watch a million interruptions for stats such as ""let's look at a graph of this guys blocks vs fouls"" constantly during gameplay and it just gets frustrating to even play a game. It has its moments of fun, but it's full of bugs and frustrating mechanics			"

												Unplayable. Input Lag in my park is so bad that I can be running with the point guard. Hit the right stick, and the player won't turn for a full two seconds (no lie). Maybe in the US or UK you are experiencing less of an impact. But if you live in Australia even with a high speed NBN connection this game is TRASH! Seriously if you are over 18 you would be better placed to spend money on a hooker rather than this game, even with the risk on contracting an STD. The graphics are dope, but the game play is just dreadful and it can't be recommened for any reason. Anyone that does receommend this game is too young to understand the grand days of gaming.

												After playing a good 100 hours I can give my review,however I only play mycareer so its based on only this mode.It;s a good looking game again this year and quite fun,probably the best 2k I played at least.I like the new training instead of the old mode,having said that I do miss some old featsures like GM meetings and the options you had there.The gameplay is good ,the animations are good..until..yes until the cpu decides to start the 2k cheese.2k has always denied that they put in a program to basically screw you at times,sometimes more,sometimes less.The fact remains is that every single player experiencing this game will admit that the cpu often will flat out cheat you and it's no dofferent this year.After a 100 hours I am at a point where it then becomes frustrating and you get mad rage.If you love basketball this is still the best experience you will get in a video game,however if you already have a 2k version there isnt much need to get the newest,seeing they capped us this year and it quite honestly becomes more silly with every new version of 2k.This game is a mixed experience really and I would rate it a 6/10.

												2k17 is awesome. Had a small issue with not being able to connect to 2k servers on myplayer, but that was fixed by freeing up space on my harddrive (i know.. sounds weird but it worked) The graphics are better than 2k16, the body up collision system is great, feels crisp and clean, I love it.

												NBA2K17... Where do I begin... To begin with, I have played NBA since 2010 and seeing the game evolve makes me happy, but there are still some major issues that the devs have to deal with, which I feel like should've been fixed by nowPros:+ Graphics and player faces looks amazing, this is the most realistic nba game ever made imo+ MyCareer being better than ever and all the other modes too! Really enjoy playing everything+ If you're a MyTeam fan, you will most likely get content each weekI wish I could add more pros for this game but there are too many issues I feel like to do so for now...Cons: - Glitches and animations while playing matches, for an instance, some bodyparts of some players would dissapear, and all the BS animations that you are familiar from earlier games still exist to some degree. - A program called Cheat Engine is used to modify the game, MyTeam for the most part. On console, the max you can list a player for is 100k, but using cheat engine, the price can be set to whatever creative amount you want, and to some degree this is game-braking... Especially if you're going to collect 2.5K cards for the best card in the game (debatable) this also makes VC useless in MyTeam since you're going to need a s*** loads of MT to afford just a 87-89 rated card... This has been a problem for 3 years so do not expect a patch...- VC is very overpriced (IMO) and VC ( the currency used in NBA2K games ) is pretty much needed for most activites within the game... The game is really fun but if you're going to buy it, you should get it for console if you have the chance. Would not recommend buying it on PC if you're going to play MyTeam, but every other mode should work fine...Giving this game a 7/10 simply because of the graphics and great modes , would've given higher if 2K would start work on theese PC problems that has existed for a long time			"

												Really big issues with this game so far. They improved the my player skill level upon last years which was awful. They also did not give us some overly dramatic story like last years. The simple cut scenes are fine for what they are. The only bug I see currently is that the score changes on the scoreboard before the actual shot goes in.			"

												Best basketball game out there, but they spent too much time developing things in the game that nobody uses at all, like the trading cards, instead of focusing on what people really want, which is a seamsless online multiplayer experience, which this game does NOT have....you can take you custom player and play in myPark like the 1 on 1 or 2vs 3 vs 3 street games, on the PC version only, because there are never any other players for matchmaking for regular online NBA team games, where players traditionally take their team and vs. other players teams online....like for example, you play as the warriors, and somebody else online pays as the pistons or whatever....also the team you are on in your career is not possible to be played with online at all, only your individual player in mypark...straight bull in my opinion, and the deal breaker?...THIS GAME HAS NO VOICE CHAT FOR PC!....So even if the online community was bigger than 20 peoples in the world playing at a time, and you coullld actually find somebody in matchmaking to play against?...you wouldnt even be able to communicate with them....same applies for your pick-up games in my park, literally no way at all to communiate with the players. if you are planning to purchase this game for anything other than the career mode, which is lacking and quite reptative imo aslo...DON'T DO IT...I made that mistake, and I shouldve just stuck with 2016, and I honestly would have if I would;ve known that a game company would release a game in 2017 that is an online multiplayer SPORTS game to top it of....that has....no...communication options...no voice chat....no text chat...nothing at all...and there are literally never more than about 10 people online during the afternoon prime-time, and if you want play with somebody in my park (dont know why you would, its nno fun without communication) other than between the hours of 5pm-10pm?...yah, good luck cuz it isnt going to happen. HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY AND I WOULD TAKE A REFUND INSTANTLY IF THAT WERE AN OPTION, BECAUSE I DIDNT KNOW ANY OF THESE THINGS UNTIL A WEEK AFTER I BOUGHT IT, and tried to go online for my first time, because I wanted to buld my character up first...I went to mypark at about 2am....and there was literally nobody there for a half hour straight until i gave up, and went online to the forums to see why that was, and come to find out, the online community is so small, that there is hardly ever anybody to play with...literally not 1 single person outside of the prime-hours, and ever if it were flooded with players? nope, still absolute horse crap because when theirs no communication between you and other players at all, what the hell is the fun in that? More fun to play vs. the AI...Literally...So yah, just take my word for it, and unless this game is $10 or less, don't buy it because you will be greatly dissapointed with 80% of the game....the only 20% you will like, is the myCareer mode, which once again, is lacking in an interesting story greatly, and is extreeeemely repetative....so IMO this game is good for a week of entertainment before you get completely bored with it. and for that? No more than $10.			"

												-RPG basketball gameYou play as one character for one position.Can choose an ""archetype"" that pairs with your position. RPG nerds rejoice!Earn virtual currency from games to pay for more stats.-Lots of contentThere's lot of other modes: be manager of a team, simulate your own league, play online as one player or team. In multiplayer team mode, you collect cards that give your team better players and boosts.One player mode has lots of cutscenes well acted and entertaining and I feel a deep connection to the characters, deeper than some RPGs I played.So many animations and well blended, so many commentary variations, good music selection, can even make your own content.Well worth $60 - can buy cheaper from elsewhere-very steep learning curveTo this day I can't get defense down even as ""lockdown defender"", feels like you're on rollerskates on the floor or a car (i'm 93 overall). Impossible to chase your man well, acceleration needs to be toned down. Need to memorize dribble moves, although controls are somewhat intuitive. -UI a little confusing sometimesYou won't see important tooltips if you use a mouse, gotta use a controller. Took me a while to find out how to create a new character. Also lack of a manual can make it hard for newbies, like not knowing how to get badges or what certain attributes do (really depended on youtube).-xbox one controller a little weirdCan't use right stick aim properly, degrees always off center. Don't have this problem with other controllers.-Other suggestions for developersDon't like the virtual currency concept, makes the game like a pay to win (or pay to save time). Would be nice to skip movies or a watch later option. Also make transition scenes faster to make it easier for grinders. Also my game settings keep resetting even though I saved them. But other than that a great iteration.Looking for an alternative? Try Freestyle2: Street Basketball (seems fine except for the passing and blocking dunks)			"

												This game was released pretty much as an incomplete product for pc. All games I've tried, be it myteam, mycarreer or play now leave me with just 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter. Like its still a demo version or something? Blacktop doesnt work at all. Loads the game then bugs out, saying you complete the game and that its saving points to your account. Character models for certain plers are floating heads with hands and feet. Really a pathetic release. Controls as usual are wonky without a controller, which begs the question why not go back to the 2k15 controls for pc, those were MUCH more fluid.All in all i feel as though i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ away 100$ on a game that they probably wont patch or update for a while. Very disappointed 2k. With the collosal failure that was 2k16 on pc. I was expecting something good.			"

												The game is unplayable. In every game mode games start with 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter. Blacktop won't even start. Even Scrimmage ends after 2 minutes (there is NO CLOCK in scrimmage!!!)In myteam, after a challenge game no MT awarded nor the challenge was unlocked (this happened 3 times).Nowhere was officially stated that KOBE myteam card will have limited contracts.Do yourself a favor and ask for a refund before playing for 2 hours or having the game for 14 days.They rejected my refund request because I've playd for 24 hours in 10 days, while most of the time I've tried to solve the numerous bugs and glitches through 2K's crappy support tickers, where they reply with spam-like lines that don't fix anything at all. 2K is the worst company ever.

The game is quite hard on keyboard to get used to, however, once you're used to it you can get really good.

												This game has really taken a turn for the worse since 2k15. Its unrealistic. I could handle it when it was making small improvements in the motion and animations department, because the game stayed true to realism. This game has scrapped that and decided realism isnt important anymore. The animations look great, the defense and the way players move feels awesome, but in terms of how realistic the game is in comparison to the actual NBA, this game is awful. For example, I can play MyTeam with an all star team lineup and still to a team like the Atlanta hawks just because every single person on their team can all of a sudden shoot threes at a 100% from minimum 2 shots. And thats not an exaggeration. Every single player (excluding Dwight) that got time in that game from the Atlanta hawks took ATLEAST 2 3 point shots and made atleast 2. (Some made more, some took more). Mean while, I have Steph Curry WIDE open in the corner atleast 4 times and doesnt hit a single one. One of the shots I can understand was a little contested but the other 3 were not. This is just one example. There are many more that have frustrated me over the time that this game has been out and to be quite honest, im ready to uninstall this game. It sucks because I am a major fan of 2K and what they have done with the basketball gaming industry. But theyre getting to above themselves and not listening to fans want like they used to...remind you of any other companies?WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME! Go back to 2k15 or even 13.			"

												Game is good but defense is annoying in this game and is too buff. The MyPark is highly bias being that shooters (such as my self) have to deal with crappy lag (even though im using ethernet wired connection) while the dunks and layups are press a button and be done with. The sharpshooter has some of the stupidest attribute caps on my career and if you wanna go show out on my park dont try to shoot jumpshots. (my shot meter doesnt even show, one tap and its full making me brick). Bigmen are too fast in this game while guards (unlesh slashers) basically have average speed. If you ask me this game has really good content but the gameplay is trash on my park. The design is too bias and unrealistic being that both curry and irving have really great handles (as all point guards should have) but im stuck on a attribute cap of 79 :( why even bother guarding a center if you cant jump to steal the ball. Oh and ball handling in this game is a joke. one poke and its out. I'm dissapointed in this game. I had so much hopes for it and it only delivered on graphics and new content but the gameplay is aweful being that they over rated defense.			"

												After being very disappointed with the lackluster at best titles 2K has put out for the past few years, including 2K16 last year for the PS4, I had no intention of buying 2K17.  The only reason I decided to play it was because of the free to play weekend on Steam.  It was a good chance to try out the game for free plus see how it ran on my newly built gaming PC as I make the transaction from console back to PC.Keep in mind, I NEVER play online, due to cheaters and everyone choosing the Cavs or the Warriors every game.  I also won't review any mode that makes use of VC (myPlayer, myPark, etc).   I have never bought VC and don't plan to because I am very against micro transactions. Because of this, my review is only for offline quick play and offline franchise mode.  Also keep in mind this is my first NBA2K game on the PC so some things I mention may have already been here since I'm comparing it to 2K16 for PS4.After finishing downloading the game I ran a quick play just to get a feel of the game and for the most part the game ran very smooth on my PC.  Graphics are good but since I never played this on my PS4 I don't have anything to compare it to.  Player models are great and look like their real-life counterparts.  There is great detail when you zoom closer and for the arenas I played it, they look true to life.  AI seems somewhat improved from last year, so it doesn't feel like the game is blatantly cheating you (i.e non stop offense rebounds for the CPU, constant missed layups, blocked shots always going back to the CPU, etc).  But I originally said the same thing about 2K16 until I started getting more games in then the cheating became more rampant.  There are still some shake my head moments that I've encountered, like knocking the ball away for an easy fast break score and the player I was controlling would just stop for no reason allowing the CPU to get the ball back.  Also some CPU rebounds seemed highly unlikely but for the most part these are toned down from last year. (so far)I also like the ability to coach and run plays on the fly, it took some getting used to, but I finally started getting the hang of it at the end of my free to play period.  Another thing I really like about the presentation is how the game switches up the broadcasting crew.  Last year it was Kevin Harlan, Greg Anthony, and Clark Kellogg every single game, but this year they have random announcers each game, sometimes it would be the crew I mentioned above, other times it would be Doris Burke, Steve Smith, Chris Webber, and a couple of others.  Its a break from the monotonous broadcasting in previous years.  I suspect however if you play a lot of games, even the new broadcasting approach would get old.   The pregame, halftime and post game crew is still Kenny, Ernie, and Shaq and they have some new dialogue, but even during my free period they started repeating themselves.Franchise mode is pretty much the same from last year.  So everything from 2K16 is still here including some problems:1.)  Like 2K16, If you edit your team's jersey, you cannot easily go back to the default uniforms without downloading them back from the 2K community.2.)  NBA Championship celebration is still lackluster as always.  No locker room celebrations from what I saw; just a few seconds of celebrations from the players, and then it just skips to the trophy presentation, then cuts to the MVP holding the MVP trophy.   I will say the ring ceremony the following season is a little better than 2K16.  In addition to my complaint on this, also if your team had won its first championship the previous season, they get no championship patch on the back of their jerseys like they do in real life.  Also, if your time adds a title, then the trophy count does not increment.  This may be hard to implement, so it is nitpicking, but at the minimum it should at least add the patch.3.)  This year added the money ball rack to the All star weekend 3pt contest, but there is no way to place your money ball rack in the All star weekend 3 point competition like they can do in real life.  For every player its always the last rack. 4.)  Dunk contest is the same as last year with the exact same dunks.  5.)  All star game still shows Air Canada Centre on the center billboard, even though the court says New Orleans.  Also on All Star Saturday, the court is clearly still in Toronto.6.)   In 2K16, the Raptors jerseys had the all star patch on them even when entering later years in your franchise, I didn't get to confirm that this still occurs this year with the Pelicans, but I am sure its still there.Despite the issues, its a pretty good game offline speaking, but I feel I could get bored with it after a while.  As I said before, I'll never play online, and that is where it seems most of the issues lie.The only way I can begin to recommend this game is if you are strictly offline and only if you can get it for around $30.  $60 is just too much to pay if you are only going to use it for off line play.  I enjoyed my free play but even with the $39 sale price this weekend, I still won't get it. If it comes down to $30 down the road, I may consider itI'm on the fence with this one, aside from a few additions there is nothing really new here and many of the issues and oversights from last year carry over to this year.  If you do any online play, then I would say pass on this one.  If you are strictly offline play, then wait until it goes down to $30 or so because its not worth the full price tag.For reference my PC specs are as follows and I had no performance issues with game play.Intel i5 6600Geforce GTX 1070ASUS Z170E16 GB DDR4 SDRAM2 TB 3.5 HD480 GB SSDWindows 10			"

												This game has great potential but it doesn't live up to it unfortunately.  The biggest problem I have is it runs much worse than nba 2k16, I have to drop most settings down a notch to get any type of consistent gameplay.  I have a gtx 1080 and even with 120 fps the gameplay isn't smooth, there are many instances of microstutter and the motion is so inconsistent.  The animations are jerky, the cloth physics seem off, even the ball suffers from jerky motion and an odd shadow effect at times.  There is nothing worse in my opinion than a sports game that suffers from microstutter or framedrops, the graphics certainly don't seem to be good enough for me to drop settings on a gtx 1080. Maybe in two months when they patch this game it will be worth $60, not at this time though.			"

												I've been a big fan of basketball and sports in general for a large majority of my life. I bought 2K16 during the summer sale, and it was one of the best sports games I have personally ever played. I took a chance and preordered this (Legendary Gold Edition. I know, I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.), and I doubt I could be more satisfied. There are many improvements from 2K16. I realize I'm being vague but oh well. I highly recommend this game, first twelve days of release (Early Access from preorder) and I'm already at 25 hours. I give it a 9/10.			"

												I'm the type of person who buys NBA 2k every year. I like the franchise mode, quick play, and messing around with the historical teams. I almost always purchase the game on xbox/ps4 and when I haven't I've kind of regret it. Normally even though I've had a PC way above 2k's recommended specs the game always seemed to be worst on pc. Controller support was never what I wanted, game seemed to run poorly, and I just felt the experience was better on console.I purchased NBA 2k16 last year on PS4 and hated it. The mechanics of the game felt broken, it seemed to run worse than I expected, and the commentary left something to be desired. Specifically a layup was practically impossible, post up shots with trash players were automatic, and any garbage player could block you from a mile away. I had to customize game sliders alot before I got to a playable experiance.I felt so burned by NBA 2k16 that I almost didnt get NBA 2k17. Since I recently upgraded my graphics card (1060) I caved and decided to give NBA 2k17 a shot on PC and I'm glad I did. The game runs very smoothe and looks great on max setting, my controller works perfectly, the physics of the game feel much better, they added a shot meter on layups (I'm a huge fan of this change), and it seems like they made an effort to throw out alot of last years game play.I do wish they'd add better commentary to the throw back teams (they had great commentary in 2k10 or whatever the 1st jordan title was) and I've yet to test online play but I would definately recomend this game to any NBA fan. I'd also say that if your on the fence about PC or Console go PC this time.			"

												I think it is an overall sound game. The gameplay is phenominal. I know people are really hating on this game because of the vc buying, and the player archetypes. But people who complain about the gameplay mechanics are flat whiners. That part doesn't get any better in any game. I know the vc is a little spendy, but it is a good way to upgrade your player that isn't grindy. The only complaint I truly have is the price of the game. NBA 2k should be around 40-50 dollars. The game is bit overpriced, but the mycareer storyline is 10 times better than last year.			"

												2k17 is a massive upgrade from 2k16. The story from My Career is actually enjoyable unlike 2k16 and the spike Lee movie they did. The game play is smooth and just better than 2k16. The game has two problems I have noticed the performance is great on my rig (gtx 970, i5-6500, 16gb of ram) but you can't skip cutscenes right now and if you change your refresh rate from 60hz to 144hz the cutscenes are speed up faster so the voice sync is completely off.Overall a great upgrade from 2k17.

												Poor keyboard support and frustrating navigation of menus.No way of skipping cutscenes. Most of them are long and have no player influence.Less responsive gameplay than 2k13 or 2k15.Extended Review after 200+ hours of gameplay and numerous patches:This game is still badly broken and by far the least fun I've had playing a 2K game. Gameplay issues that have plagued all previous titles - Bad help defence, constant terrible double teams, your character being stuck in cement and running in quicksand, teammates going out of their way to brick wall you, broken pass selection, teammates still allowing way too many rebounds etc. etc. are all features of this title once again.They also made fouls and turnovers even more frequent. As usual, fouls in the paint are a given, but add to that virtually every steal attempt and more regular fouls on jumpshots. Meanwhile the AI can strip you at will without even a steal animation.Onto the bugs that have destroyed the game thanks in part to the stupid archetypes that severely limit the kind of character you can create.My first character was a shot creator PG pre-patches. I played the full 82 game season and abandoned the character, the first character I've even given up on because the shot timing and badges were/still are bugged made every shot an F other than open dunks.My second was a Glass Cleaner C and after some patches were finally released, it was fun for a little while, minus all the frustrations listed above from previous versions. But after unlocking almost all of the badges and winning a championship, I was ready to go back to a guard role.Thinking that maybe the game would be fixed by now, I created a Slasher SG and was going okay until unlocking the badge Relentless Finisher, which started bugged, was fixed, and is bugged again. Every layup is an F and will miss.Welcome back to Free Throw Simulator 2k17..3 characters, 2 abandoned. 2K have already released multiple patches and hotfixes and I doubt they will continue much longer. The game is unfortunately broken trash.			"

												So, I'm going to be pretty negative with this one. First off, the gameplay and graphics feel and look like this is a 2008 video game... It's on PC, is supposed to be ""nextGen"" visuals, and it isn't. NBA 2k13 looks better than this game does... and thats nearly 5 full games ago! The scan a face tool, well it's annoying at best to use. Not very optimally created. The game as a whole, unless you have a PC powerful enough to run 4k, looks like complete crap. The MyPLAYER mode was an improvement in my mind. Giving a legitimate depth and story to YOUR career, FIFA 17 did this with a static pre-made character and it was phenomenal, so thumbs up there 2K! Other issues include shotty internet connections and speeds (and I DO have good internet, seeing I can host 6 people all on an MMO on my internet at the same time with no major issues). So I'd rate this game a 2/10. Definitely cut corners compared to console and is most certainly NOT worth 60 dollars.			"

												OK, so I have created myplayer with the facescan. It was pretty cool. I started my career and have since played my first game. Overall the pacing is slow but everything is well done as far as story is concerned. Issues: Sound during games randomly has static or something its a weird loading glitch or something. Graphically my first ACTUAL game 2 players randomly had no arms and legs so just floating hands and feet. A little unnerving. And my last cutscene with my agent my left eye was bugging out of my head for some reason leaving me feeling like the game is falling apart. I'll update if the issue fixes itself or persists. If it persists it's quite gamebreaking and I will be asking for a refund.			"

												A little about me. I have 332 hours in NBA2K16. ALL those hours are Franchise mode playing EVERY game @ 9 minutes quarters including playoffs (On Superstar Diff.). I have NEVER played any other game mode honestly. So now you know how I play the game I wanna talk about this year compared to last from a Franchise mode players perspective except all I want to talk about is controls. THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!!! I find myself flying around the court almost out of control on defense. On offense I found directional passing really off and throwing bad passes to people I wasnt even aiming for. The shot meter is different too and I was willing to give it a couple games to adjust before berating it but after 12 hours I was still shooting horribly and sometime I would slightly move the stick and my player would do a full move almost automatically (and get blocked). That mostly happend when I would try to pump fake (couldnt do it). I was getting super frustrated and even had to drop the difficulty to no avail. It was not fun and I LOVE the NBA 2K series. Im going back to 2K16 tho and continue my franchise :)If you already own and played a lot of 2K16 I do not recommend. If you're new you wont know any better so go for it.			"

												The game is unoptimized and still has problems with online disconnects after game loads. Disappearing arms, etc. Cut scenes are sped through if you're using a monitor that isn't 60hz.The caps/archetypes are ridiculous for my career. You can't recreate any legendary player because you are stuck with caps and archetypes. It really ruins the fun for this game mode.			"

												I had a high expectation but the result is very disapointing. My laptop is an alienware R17 with 32g Ram and attached an GTX 1080 video card but still the game crashes very often and it can't even run 1080p resoultion smoothly. Please dont buy this game untill they came up with patch.The performence problem solved. Once you updated the Geforce, some times the default setting of graphic processor will change back to the default setting which is not using the high performence graphic setting.However, there are few bugs i want to suggest here.1. Missing arms of point guard in MC around the end of one match.2. any defender can push you all the way to baseline that disobeys any law of physics.3. Not a bug but really bad face modelling for some players, for example Yao Ming and T-mac.I wouldn't recommend this game untill the bugs are fixed.			"
