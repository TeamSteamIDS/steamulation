												I gave this game many chances with previous releases but every year this game disappoints with new release on so many things. The multiplayer came thinking this should be a good change to the game. But its not. Whoever is the first to pick a club in league will have a DREAM TEAM in their first 11. They just transfer anyone they want because there is no human running other clubs to refuse the offer.NO BALANCE Now I have to compete with club that has Messi, C.Ronaldo, Neymar, Iniesta, Nuer, ect. in formation while I as manager of Barcelona have some nobodies becase all of my important players got transfered before I joined. How is that a fair competition ?Not to mention the game tends to crash at random times. Match Engine simulation is a downfall, you have to watch a boring textWhat a suprise another negative rewiev on their game. I am tired of giving this a try. Next sequel that comes out won't even bother with it.			"

												Boot game up, check available leagues. Every leage that's waiting to start has someone whose already claimed every top player in the world in their squad. We're talking one team that resembles the FIFA Dream Team list they release each year, in every single league by virtue of having logged in first.Turn game off.There are dozens of web based soccer manager games far superior to this by simple virtue of not letting the transfer market start untill a full league is ready, or by having the NPC clubs not give away their players, or so on and so on. If you're looking for SP, just get the latest version of Football Manager, if you're looking for MP, ♥♥♥♥ it do a google search for online soccer manager, you're sure to find something better.			"

												Crashes alot. Only one save slot to get another you have to buy it. No FFP but spending is very limited, For example Real Madrid only starts with 25 million dollars. Only way to get alot of money without selling any of your players is to win everything and save up or through in game purchase. Transfer market is boring. A few big moves (Pogba to Bayern or Neymar to PSG) every one and a while, and no club tries to buy any of your players unless you transfer list them. Once you sign a player their contract never runs out. It is hard to develope youth players. Rivals will directly buy and sell to each other. Multiplayer is a come back one a day affair. It is best to just join a league than to form your own.Overall I had a decent time with the game. It boring after a while. I enjoyed multiplayer more than the single player. I also hate how they force you to update to Soccer Manager 2017.			"

												All the people moaning make me laugh but also make me a bit angry - it's FREE, you ungrateful *****! Considering that fact, this is an excellent download and a very decent management game. It isn't one of those games that lure you in to make you spend real money either, that side of things is strictly optional.The game has all the correct teams/players, upgradeable stadia/facilities (can also build new stadia), basic customisable training regimens and scouts, chronological trophy cabinet and all the basics, and more, of a decent football management sim. Some transfers can be a bit unrealistic but that afflicts most management games, also you can't choose sponsors or ticket prices (I don't think).I've only played single player but for the £0.00 price, you simply cannot go wrong!Technical tip: if your timer kind of splutters and slows down on 30x setting, just double-click in the middle of the timer and it will normalise.

												i have been a big fan of manager games in football - ever since i played total club manager 2004 (which i still play), so when i saw this was on steam and free i gave it a go (i mean all i'd lose was a few minutes), nut no it is really funlove the single player mode - needs more teams and counitres added but otherwise it's great with tactics, transfers and the likes anyone who has played a manegment game in the past should try this, like i said all it costs is time and i really like itthe multiplayer is sadly not played too much but again i like the idea of playing real time (2 games a week), even my mum plays this mode it's easy to play and give you a real treat to come back to a few times a weeki'd give it a 8/10			"

												Well, actually I liked the game, but there are some points I totally disliked.First, I could not make screenshots and I can't get any achievement cards so later I found a similar one but without those flaws.Secondly, the multiplayer got me surprised as I could not figure out how it works and even though I learnt it later I still don't find it interesting. Or perhaps I got it wrong,I liked the single one and I even won some games, yeah it's not that bad.			"

												Soccer Manager is a fantasy soccer manager from the same company as Soccer Manager 2016 and Soccer Manager 2015.  About time they made a single version that don't change with the years. You have to like and know real life Soccer to play this game.  It worked, looked ok, plays off your Steam ID and can be used on other devices and your can use your Facebook account too.  I guess it Plays like any other fantasy sports game.  Played a top down simple view fast match and it lets you coach too.  Try it if you like like Soccer and like playing fantasy sports games.  You have a choice of playing the single player Soccer Manager 2016 and the multiplayer Soccer Manager Worlds.  The multiplayer game i don't recomend because of unfairness in the recruiting the best soccer players from the NPC managed teams, according what i read on other reviews.I don't like or playing fantasy sports games, so don't know enough besides the game runs up to starting and playing through a match on the single player mode.  This is a Quick Review.  Try it or not, i don't care.For more info:

												Loving Soccer Manager Worlds, I played Soccer Manager 2015 before and loved it, played a bit of 2016 but I am now loving the new Multiplayer one, I've never been able to get into the Multiplayer ones such as the ones available on mobile but I am really enjoying this one so far as each team seems to have unique players started with them, for example I had West Ham with Peter Cech. And you are able to communicate with other managers via messaging so if you want to enquire about a player instead of just putting out a bid you can talk to them first and see what they want and do some actual business.It also has an interesting news system that shows what's happening, who's signing who and who's becoming or resigning as manager.Definitely recommend to people who like these manager games and maybe to those who play FM if they are looking for a more fast paced game with less detail but still good fun.

												As a huge football (soccer for American folk) fan, I naturally installed this game. I was excited to play, and while it was fun, it was rather disappointing.The single player was something like ""manager mode"" (if it was called like that) in FIFA and PES, except you, of course, cannot play a match as the players or see it like in FIFA or PES, and you'll have to wait a long time for it to end. It gets boring as you can't change plenty of things during the match. The multiplayer was promising at first, and I was realy ""hyped"" and entered as manager in 3 clubs, and I read that, as a new player, I'll have to log in and play multiplayer every day in the first week of playing the game. I thought I would be able to do so, but time has proven that it's always against me yet again, and I didn't play it 'cause I had to do other things. Guess what happened? If they don't want players to be managers in clubs and they don't play the game, they should at least do it if you don't play for a week, for example.

												Honestly, this is an amazing game. Why is it free? There's no malware. No ads. No bad qualities.  Oh, there's a 3d version which costs 50 bucks? This is good enough, so save your money and get this.			"

												This game is really boring and unless you've played these types of games before there is no tutorial to show you how to play. With this being the case it also made this a boring game and there's no point in playing the older versions of the game since they all direct you to the latest one anyways			"
