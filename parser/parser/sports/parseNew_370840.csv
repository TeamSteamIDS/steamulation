												Definitely not worth the price tag. The game is just a patched version of Rugby Challenge 2. Literally the gameplay and animations are 100% the same. Just one big tweak is that you can actually win your own ball back from rucking this time round. There a few game modes added but as I say it's all just patch work. Sadly I'm a Rugby addict and I knew this before I bought it, I was that desperate for the improved rucking so I could have a half realistic game & I also hoped there would be an online community. So far there isn't it. Hopefully in time there will be.			"

												Let me set the scene, your life is great, you get home in a great mood and you think ''nothing can mess up my day now''. Enter Rugby Challenge 3. SSDG(same S$%^ different game). They have simply reskined Rugby Challenge 2 and the game breaking issues are still there.I will try to explain the issues in a constructive way as I have played through a couple of games and a few seasons as pro.Pros: 1.Its a game about rugby2. Looks nice3. Its a game about rugbyCons: 1. You cannot change the controls. Not a major issue at first until you play as a pro as the button for ''stealing'' the ball is the same as kick to touch. So everytime you get a great turnover your teammate proceeds to kick it straight into touch.2. The game follows no logical rugby philosophy. The AI(on hardest difficulty) has this great move where they go down a 3 m blindside only to throw a 20m pass over the ruck to the outside centre. Players face one way and pass another way. AI decides to kick a up and under with one person to beat, its all just laughable(which I guess is a positive). Another one of my favourites is how the ball always goes over the fullback who then proceeds to try passing the ball in the in goal instead of kicking for touch.3. Do not underestimate how stop-start this game is. Get ready for endless knock-ons and forward passes. Now I watch a lot of rugby and even at schooboy 6th team level there are not as many handling errors as this. I am not talkin about crap players with bad stats, these are supposed NZ all stars just randomly knocking on and passing forward in the funniest situations.4. The rules do not apply here. So you kick over the defence and the fullback punts the ball back, everyone in front of him is offisides right? Not if the AI controls them. For some reason that boggles my mind offside in that situation only applies to the Player not the AI. This takes away any counter attacking running plays.5. The scrums are a bit of a joke. Scrumming will become your life in this game. With the number of handling errors this will become your game, waiting for what seems like a hour of back and forth on a scrum. Want to speed up the game? Make a max of 2 contest on the scrum and done.6. Injuries. Rugby is a sport of injuries. Luckily the devs care about the players so as soon as someone is injured the game is stopped and a scrum has to happen. No matter what the situation it has to happen.I really wish I did not have to write this review as we need devs willing to try and make games about smaller sports like Rugby. I have purchased everyone from the original Lomu game which still remains the best and most fluid. Alas I guess we have to accept that we will never have an acceptable rugby game and the enjoyment received will be mostly due to the flaws and not due to the gameplay. "

												Okay I'm going to say I enjoy the game and it deserves a positive rating, for the following:- It is THE best Rugby game out today- It is an improvement over RC2 in various subtle ways that were needed- It is the ONLY online rugby game for PC you can buy,- The fanhub and the wonderful PC modding community mean that the licencing issues will not be a problem for too long.There is one negative which is that the launch pricetag for what is essentially an update of RC2 (albeit with some very welcome features and modes and fixes) is unacceptable. Please TruBlu see some sense and discount the game so that the community can recommend new players and the game/online community can thrive.Do I like the game? Yes definitely.Can I recommend it at Â£40 - a pricetag which no other premium Steam titles hold? If you are desperate for a good rugby game/online play, then yes. If you liked RC1 but didn't manage to get RC2 then probably. But players already owning RC2 will feel ripped off at full price if they don't have the money to throw around.Update - I have yet to have an unplayable online game (I've played against 5 opponents - including UK, Aus and S.America - I am in the UK). All games have been quite smooth. This was not the case with RC1 and RC2 at launch - maybe it is to do with better internet connections in general, or perhaps they have improved the code a little in that area as well. Either way - this is a massive plus point for me. Come and join us online.  :)I haven't yet spent any real time with the offline gameplay modes, so the above is based on core gameplay and online play only at present.			"

												Not worth the price. No improvement in gameplay.No use in playing when lineouts 90% of the time get thrown past the jumpers,the 9 is never at the rucks. Forwards spend most of the time in the backline.Even setting the pods to 4/4 which solved the forwards in RC2.No progression of career mode and AI chooses worse possible teams.No distinction in 15s vs 7s players, 7s players end up in the 15s team.NOT WORTH IT.

												I honestly really enjoyed myself playing this game and it's my first Rugby game I have ever owned. I'm very impressed and I'm not very critical but there are a bit of errors here and there but that doesn't really affect the play of the game imo. If you like rugby, it's either Rugby Challenge 3, Rugby League Live or Rugby 08. The controls are really messing with me since it's my first time but I think I'll have the controls down within a week. I'll recommend this game since the tutorial is very in-depth and explains a lot about the game.			"

												Based on the game in the current state its the and in its current price point unless you are a rugby fanatic who must have the most up-to-date version of the game there is just not enough improvement over the previous version of the game to spend US$50 if it was 20 or even 25 I would recommend it. I was hoping for improvements in the graphics over the console version but it is pretty much just a carbon copy I've also come across several weird bugs where the ball will suddenly go back 50 m for no apparent reason or the players will become invisible at lineout time. Hopefully these things are patched extremely quickly so at least the  core gameplay is solid passing also still does not feel fluid like real rugby. Having said all that it is still the best rugby experience available for now if you really love your rugby you'll probably enjoy this game when it becomes a bit cheaper.			"

												I'm a self-described rugby fanatic and I've been pining for a good rugby game on PC for a long time.  In the midst of extremely poor sound quality, average modeling and animations, shoddy roster management and sub-par commentary, there is a reasonably well put together game here and I'm sure I'll get my money's worth; the real question is whether there is enough to justify the price for the average punter.  At $USD50.00 I'm sad to say that I could see most people walking away.Before buying, I'd done my research by reading the reviews and watching gameplay on YouTube so I knew what I was in for.  What's most disappointing is that this is really just Rugby Challenge 2.5.  It has some improvements over its predecessor but no where near enough to justify the price.  The new Rugby Sevens mode is interesting but not my cup of tea.  I'd have much rather seen a more in-depth management mode and players statistics that improve over time.  Team licencing is still an issue but the Fan Hub feature is supposed to deal with that so I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt and wait to see if that makes the experience feel more authentic over time.Overall, I'll have to side with ""recommending"" this game but only because I feel there is no worthy alternative for someone wanting to play a modern rugby game on PC.  The production quality is disappointingly low and way behind other sports franchises so unless you are a rugby tragic like me, and desperate to play on PC, Rugby Challenge 3 is your best bet.  That said, if it's an option for you, I expect buying the console version would be a much more affordable solution in the long-run.			"

												Let's get right to it, it's expensive and you could get better games for the price, but you certainly can't get a rugby game anywhere near as good. Yes it's still not what we want, the teams are outdated the tournaments are outdated, sometimes I have no clue what I'm doing and feel like I'm just pressing buttons. But somehow I love it and keep on playing again and again. Maybe it is because it gives me hope that there is a future for rugby games. Buy it! Play it, Give Feedback! And help develop this game and give the developers what they need to provide us with a better game.Pros: - It's a playable rugby game!- It has 7s!!Cons:- Outdated Teams and Tournaments			"

												RC2 was good game, the gameplay in this a small improvement, so like RC2.1 (better advantage play, no wild passes from the AI, otherwise the same as far as I can tell, maybe I'll spot some more subtle changes with alittle more play).The addition of Seven's and Be a pro mode are good, add another dimension, and are well implemented.Not got my head around the FanHub fully but it looks promising. Is it worth the $100 NZD? probably no.  If you have RC2 then you might want to wait until the price drops.  If you have RC1 or have never bought into this series then go for it.  If you just love rugby then get it and play online.8/10 for gameplay (not tried online play, if that's smoother now this will go up).9/10 for features.5/10 for price (Better priced in other countries, which is just wrong).

												Agreed the price is an insult as it is just a reskinned RC2.  Yes the fanhub is pretty cool and will add to the experience.  However, over and above that the tweaks to the gameplay are pretty minor.  Still considering that this is still by far the ONLY decent rugby game out there, then I suppose we rugby fanatics will have to be grateful that at least TruBlu and and Wicked Witch are trying to cater to us.  It's a good game essentially with lots of content despite the licensing issues and if you're into your rugby hours of gameplay value.  However, is it really worth the price tag and will you see any eyepopping changes from Rugby Challenge 2?  Short answer no and if that is really important to you then wait till it goes on sale and keep playing RC2.  If you never got RC2 and can simply wait no longer to play some rugby on your PC then you won't be disappointed despite the legitimate screams of indignation from your wallet!			"

												For a game that the released date was delayed, you would think you would have updateded rosters. Fanhub will help with downloading correct teams and rosters though. The game isn't worth the asking price. Gameplay isn't fluid, feels sluggish when running and passing, rucks are a lottery if your gonna win one or lose it. Only played a few hours but disappointed. My biggest complaint is WTF is up with Try conversions being worth 3 points???? You would think the game creators would know how much a conversion is worth, come on!!! Am I the only one who noticed this?Wait till its on sale IF your a keen rugby fan and can put up with the bugs. Makes my copy of Tropico 5 look like a worthwhile purchase (that says alot).			"

												I greatly enjoyed RC2, Somehow after 3 years they have managed to make an even worse game, after delays to the release date they give us a pro career in which you get fired for being injured? I was sceptical about the Â£40 price tag, and you should be too, in no way shape or form is this worth the price, I pray for a patch to fix a lot of the issues I have with the career mode like no player progression (except for the pro), clubs dropping all their best players to the bench and reserves, 15's teams being able to sign and call up 7's players which vastly over rate the 15's players for some god awful reason.Please do something about this, or you risk wrecking a potentially brilliant game.

The game itself is enjoyable although i think if you do not play rugby or have any experience with knowing the rules and how it works you may not enjoy it. Although this the only thing i do not like is the passing and it seems a bit glitchy when running  with the controls (not FPS).

Rugby Challenge 3 is 80 percent the same game as its predecessor.PROS-Now with 7's!-Create your own Pro-More teams-Ref's call more kinds of penalties now.CONS-Vitrually the same-Graphics are good, but the character's face textures are a little off.-SAME COMMENTARY! DX-Same bugs as the last game-Too similar as last game.I have to say, I'm suprised they even got this game out.  You can't be hard on the developers because this game is almost unmarketable in the Western Hemisphere, so they're broke.  The biggest markets for video games are in The United States and Canada.  Yet, Rugby Football is not popular here, so it will never be up to FIFA standards.Nevertheless, it is still a good game.			"

												I have played all the Rugby challenge games and was hoping they would employ similar game mechanics and fluidity like Rugby League Live 3 has, this time round. This is not the case, If you want a fluid rugby experience, even if you are only a Union player, I advise grabbing Rugby league Live 3 over this game. Much more fluid game with far better flexibility to run angles and calve lines :P.Rugby Challenge 3 feels like your player is locked and cannot run the lines you want to as the support player. Rugby league live allows you to run these support lines and crack through defenses like a knife through butter! Grab Rugby league live over this for the best rugby experience you can get in gaming all round. "

												This game is actually enjoyable once you learn to play it.And hear me out on that because you do have to learn to play it, alot of negative reviews here mention misplays from unforgiving controls or inability to change controls but maybe those people should stick to the training/bench until they are ready to step up. ;)But seriously, when a game is so intricate that I can set my back line depth, defence spacing, automatic ruck commitment and kicker placement depth (just to name a few) on the fly mid match in my pro games as I control my own character you have to understand there will be a learning curve.I'm a big rugby fan and get a kick (slight pun intended) out of getting to play with my favourite teams and players (up the Waratahs and the mighty Hooper!).The ability to play your own career aspect is a nice touch that allows you to focus on and develop one character's skillset (your own self-made one or an existing player) and progress through many different competitions, hunting contracts and perhaps even work your way up to representing your country. I started out getting dropped from my starting team in the NRC and eventually worked up to playing for the Wallabies which was fun, especially when I was picked up by the Crusaders and took the Captaincy from Ritchie McCaw.....ead Ritchie.I'll be fair I have noticed a few issues with AI control and silly gameplay bugs (going blind with a .5m gap? GENIUS) which is understandable given rugby is a very dynamic game with alot of moving parts and these issues could be ironed out in the future. At the end of the day the game is still very playable and enjoyable, give it some time before you post a negative review with .50 hours of gameplay.Anyone disagree? Take me on in game! ;)			"

												probably the best rugby game at the moment. but i would recommend waiting for a steam sale because the price is really hefty.the inclusion of sevens,domestic cups and the licensing of teams makes it a good game!			"

												The Price is the least satisfying aspect of this game. Really doesn't feel worth the money especially since i already own rugby challenge 2. I bought rugby challenge 2 for $60 when it was released and still felt more satisfaction from the playing the game.			"

												A good rugby game after Rugby Challenge 2 but stil needs some improvements on gameplay. Sevens it's an interesting new feature but the time is to much while in reality they play 14 minutes and with de dead times it's somewhere to 4-5 intese play.			"

												This game is for any Rugby lover, plenty teams and graphics are really good for a sports game. Good to see lots of teams such as chiefs and Steamers in there also including sponsors, I have had a good experince with multiplayer online as it is easy to set up I would reccomend this game to anyone!

												Terrible.Look, I love rugby, I've put a lot of time into this game. But the glaring errors in the game are so infuriating I'm lucky I haven't smashed my screens.Cons:The passing system for the opposition is ridiculous, random passing in different directions will you frustrated and perplexed.The God damn Ref often manages to find himself in the way of your passes, managing to teleport himself across the damn field to get in your way, resulting knockons.When the computer is losing it somehow manages to pull off the most bullâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ usually forward passedâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥You have ever witnessed ensuring you will go spare.Pros:It's rugby on PC.Play on anything more that Normal difficulty and the AI just manages to pull off stupidly inhuman feats just to make sure you're going to lose.Just a frustratingly bad game, that has so many in game bugs and AI favourable outcomes I would suggest you save your $60 and play something else./end Rant			"
